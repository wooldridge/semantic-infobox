REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN&#13;
FINANCIAL AND ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:    Republic of Kazakhstan&#13;
Beneficiaries: National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan; State Property Committee; Ministry of&#13;
Economy; Ministry of Finance; participating commercial banks&#13;
Amount:      US$62 million equivalent&#13;
Terms:        17 years, including five years of grace period, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate&#13;
On-Lending:  Part of the Loan funds would be on-lent to the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan&#13;
under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and the National Bank, at&#13;
terms and conditions that will be substantially equivalent to those of the Bank Loan and will&#13;
be approved by the Bank. Under the Project's commercial bank development component,&#13;
proceeds of the Loan up to a total of US$12 million equivalent would be on-lent to&#13;
participating commercial banks in US dollars at an interest rate equivalent to that of 10-year&#13;
U.S. Treasury Notes plus two percent. These subsidiary loans would have a repayment&#13;
period of ten years including four years of grace. The National Bank would bear the cross&#13;
currency and default risks.&#13;
Objectives:   The Government of Kazakhstan is committed to stabilizing and transforming the economy.&#13;
It expressed this commitment in the context of a Standby Agreement with the IMF and an&#13;
Economic Rehabilitation Loan of the World Bank. The success of this economic reform&#13;
program critically depends on fundamental restructuring in the enterprise and the financial&#13;
sectors. The Project would help to accelerate and deepen this restructuring. The Project&#13;
would support the private sector and Government institutions in continuing privatization;&#13;
preparing enterprise turnaround and liquidation; resolving bad debts; and developing sound&#13;
commercial banks which would then also be able to finance enterprise-level restructuring and&#13;
new investment. The Project would also aim at ensuring efficient, rapid, and secure&#13;
payments within Kazakhstan, through creation of a new payment system infrastructure. The&#13;
Project is considered of high priority because of the local shortage of relevant experience&#13;
and resources, and because grant funding alone is not expected to be available in sufficient&#13;
volume and timeliness to provide the necessary external support.&#13;
Description:  The Loan would help finance information and communication technology, training, and&#13;
technical assistance. In the enterprise sector, the Project would: (i) continue the Bank's&#13;
assistance for the implementation of the Government's privatization program; (ii) provide&#13;
advisory services for the defensive restructuring and privatization of distressed large&#13;
enterprises, or for their liquidation; and (iii) transfer modern market economic know-how&#13;
to enterprise managers through a program of highly structured study tours. In the financial&#13;
sector, the Project would support: (i) advice for the start-up and operation of a debt&#13;
resolution institution ("Rehabilitation Trust") to force the restructuring and resolve the debts&#13;
of up to forty insolvent enterprises that burden the banks, state budget, and other creditors&#13;
most severely; (ii) institutional development programs for two promising medium-size banks&#13;
and restructuring programs for two large, formerly specialized banks, consisting of intensive&#13;
three-year assistance by foreign banks and of equipment and software for bank automation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
(iii) strengthening of prudential bank supervision through on-the-job training of bank&#13;
examiners, with increasing specialization on problem banks; and (iv) the long-term&#13;
investments for a new domestic payment system aimed at, inter alia, same-day finality of&#13;
settlements and real time processing of high value transactions. In addition, the Loan would&#13;
fund assistance for the implementation of this Project.&#13;
Benefits:     The Project would reinforce enterprise-level adjustment in the real sector. In the process,&#13;
it would also relieve the burden of the most indebted insolvent enterprises on banks and&#13;
suppliers; set precedents for liquidation and for tieing bad debt resolution to rigorous&#13;
restructuring of enterprises; build local consulting capacity for enterprise restructuring;&#13;
enhance the know-how of local company managers; improve corporate governance through&#13;
privatization; and enable banks to play an important role in enterprise restructuring.&#13;
Moreover, the Project would enhance the quality and quantity of banking services, the&#13;
prudence and financial discipline in banking, and the efficient allocation of credit (including&#13;
bank lending funded by external donors) to viable activities.  The payment system&#13;
component would facilitate financial risk management, reduce the float in the domestic&#13;
payments system, raise the efficiency and accuracy of payments, and thereby stimulate&#13;
commercial relations between enterprises.&#13;
The Project would follow up, without loss in momentum, on the Bank's Technical Assistance&#13;
Project, by helping implement policies and institution-building programs that were assessed&#13;
and designed under that earlier Project. Enhancing local institutional capacity will still be&#13;
important in the coming years because Kazakhstan's profound economic transition requires&#13;
technical capacity of extraordinary nature and extent.&#13;
Risks:        In a newly created country undergoing fundamental economic transformation there is an&#13;
inevitable risk of policy changes and implementation delays, but in Kazakhstan these risks&#13;
are worth taking in view of the Project's important role for the implementation of critical&#13;
structural reforms. (i) The risk of policy changes is common in transition economies.&#13;
However, the current direction and speed of reform in the financial and enterprise sectors&#13;
are very encouraging, the country's leadership appears firmly committed to it, and proper&#13;
external support will be essential for the success of the reforms. (ii) Delays could occur in&#13;
project implementation due to limited administrative capacity, unforeseen technical&#13;
complexities in the information systems, or slowness in preparing, deciding, and&#13;
implementing economic reforms closely related to this Project. This risk shall be reduced&#13;
through substantial assistance for Project implementation; close supervision to assure that&#13;
inefficiencies are addressed promptly; and some contractor payments being tied to critical&#13;
performance milestones.&#13;
Co-rinancing: The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) will provide parallel&#13;
financing of about US$200,000 equivalent to the training of bank supervisors. Host country&#13;
institutions participating in the manager study tour program are expected to fund their costs&#13;
of about US$200,000 on their own or with donor assistance. The direct bank-to-bank&#13;
assistance for strengthening four local commercial banks is expected to receive co-financing&#13;
of about US$4.0 million in grant funds; these arrangements need still to be confirmed. The&#13;
EBRD envisages funding the institutional development of four further commercial banks,&#13;
following the same concept but with some months delay.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN&#13;
FINANCIAL AND ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1          The Government of Kazakhstan is committed to stabilizing and restructuring the national&#13;
economy. These commitments are reflected in the Standby Agreement that has been signed with the&#13;
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Economic Rehabilitation Loan (Loan No. L-36490) agreed on&#13;
with the World Bank. The success of these programs critically depends on fundamental restructuring in the&#13;
enterprise and financial sectors.&#13;
1.2          In the enterprise sector, the Government is committed to privatizing enterprises quickly and&#13;
in a manner that is transparent, equitable, and conducive for improved corporate governance. It does so&#13;
through a program of small-scale privatization, coupon-based mass privatization, sale of the largest&#13;
enterprises on a case-by-case basis, and special methods of agricultural privatization. It is also committed&#13;
to upgrading the capabilities of enterprises managers; ensuring the provision of technical advice to enterprises&#13;
that need to restructure; and bringing the largest loss-making enterprises under the control of a central debt&#13;
resolution institution that would force them to restructure and get privatized, or be liquidated.&#13;
1.3          In the financial sector, the Government is committed to improving the efficiency of critical&#13;
infrastructure such as the payments system; strengthening prudential bank supervision; encouraging the rapid&#13;
development of private sector banks aimed at their meeting international standards; restructuring the large&#13;
formerly specialized banks; and relieving commercial banks of the heavy burden placed on them by the&#13;
largest loss-making enterprises, by transferring the respective loans to the above-mentioned debt resolution&#13;
institution.&#13;
1.4          While the Government has adopted appropriate reform policies, it lacks the institutions&#13;
necessary to implement these policies effectively. In recognition of this problem, the Bank made a Technical&#13;
Assistance Loan (Loan No. L-3642) in August 1993 to help strengthen key government agencies and conduct&#13;
various diagnostic and feasibility studies. The proposed Loan would follow up on this process by providing&#13;
key institutions with the support that they will need to implement the next phase of the reform effort.&#13;
A. Economic Background&#13;
1.5          Kazakhstan's 17 million people are spread over the second largest territory of the Former&#13;
Soviet Union (FSU) republics. Kazakhstan's per capita GNP in 1992 was estimated at US$1,690, at the&#13;
official exchange rate. Rich endowments of oil, minerals, and arable land give the country good growth&#13;
prospects in the longer run.&#13;
1.6          In the short term, however, GDP has decreased by about 15 percent for two years in a row,&#13;
in 1992 and 1993. Data for 1994 indicate a continuation of that trend, with industrial production declining&#13;
by about 30 percent during first 6 months of 1994 as compared to the same period of 1993, following a 16&#13;
percent drop in 1993. Demand suffered from a steep fall in investment expenditures, depressed consumption&#13;
levels reflecting the decline in real wages and wealth, and cutbacks in defense spending throughout the FSU.&#13;
The losses of the state enterprise sector, and the difficulties of the authorities and the financial sector to&#13;
tighten financial discipline and to force defaulting debtors to start restructuring or liquidation, were the main&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
sources of macroeconomic imbalance in 1992 and 1993. The aggregated losses reported by non-financial&#13;
enterprises grew rapidly by about 10 percentage points of GDP between 1992 and 1993 to reach 24 percent&#13;
of GDP.&#13;
1.7           Inflation averaged about 25 percent a month until final break-up of the ruble zone and&#13;
introduction of the national currency. Thereafter, the inflation accelerated to about 35 percent a month until&#13;
July 1994, bringing the annual inflation rate up to 3,200 percent by that date. The abrupt attempt in late&#13;
1993 - early 1994 to restrict credit to enterprises in order to contain monetary expansion had little impact&#13;
on inflation but triggered a payment crisis: by March 1994, inter-enterprise arrears had accumulated to a net&#13;
level comparable to total outstanding bank credit to enterprises. The Government stepped in to refinance&#13;
the said arrears. These events have impressed on the Government the urgent need for widespread enterprise-&#13;
level adjustment, and for further policy reform and institution building to encourage and enable enterprises&#13;
to carry out such restructuring.  This involves also efforts to enable the financial sector to play an&#13;
increasingly important role in the restructuring effort.&#13;
B. Status and Reform of the Enterprise Sector&#13;
1.8           Compared with other Central Asian transition economies, Kazakhstan's enterprise sector is&#13;
characterized by heavy primary industry and large-scale agriculture. Its enterprises tend to be large and&#13;
capital intensive. When the Soviet Union broke up, fixed assets per capita (in 1991 prices) in Kazakhstan&#13;
exceeded those in the rest of Central Asia's FSU republics by some 50 percent. 200 enterprises have more&#13;
than 5,000 employees, and more than 6,000 enterprises (including farms) employ 200 to 5,000 persons;&#13;
together they account for approximately three-quarters of enterprise employment. The total number of&#13;
enterprises is estimated at about 60,000. Many enterprises are combined in large groups that emerged from&#13;
former branch ministries, or departments thereof. Many markets, including distribution and trucking on the&#13;
local level, are dominated by such groups or individual state enterprises.&#13;
1.9           Kazakhstan's most prominent production sectors, and main exporters, are mining and&#13;
metallurgy, oil and gas, and large-scale farming and ranching. In terms of broader sectors, Kazakhstan&#13;
employs 1.2 million people in industry including energy; 1.1 million in agriculture; 0.6 million in transport&#13;
and communication; 0.5 million in construction; and 0.3 million in trade and related services. Within the&#13;
industry sector, mining and metallurgy account for 27 percent of employment, and the related metal&#13;
processing and machine building sub-sectors for further 18 percent; together, they are reported to account&#13;
for 53 percent of fixed assets in industry. The oil and gas industry accounts for 7 percent of employment&#13;
and 14 percent of fixed assets. (Annex I presents a statistical overview of the enterprise sector, especially&#13;
industry.)&#13;
1.10           By mid-1993, about 7,000 establishments had been formally privatized.  This was&#13;
approximately 20 percent of all state-owned business units, but it was still less than 10 percent of the state&#13;
enterprise sector's fixed assets because most transformed units were small retail and service outlets. Under&#13;
a much improved new privatization program, whose implementation unfolded in early 1994, further 2,300&#13;
non-agricultural enterprises were privatized until October 1994. In addition, more than 15,000 individual&#13;
and family farms and some 1,000 other private enterprises have been formed on the basis of state farms or&#13;
parts thereof. Official statistics reported about 6,000 additional non-farm private enterprises by early 1994,&#13;
most of them newly created, with an average of 11 employees, and there are most likely additional&#13;
businesses that remain unrecorded.&#13;
1.11          The main institution to plan and implement the privatization of state enterprises is the State&#13;
Property Committee (SPC). SPC shares authority over the territorial property committees with the heads&#13;
of the oblast administrations. SPC and its territorial committees together have some 800 staff. SPC has also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
been responsible for exercising the state's ownership role in enterprises, but this function might now be&#13;
transferred into a new, separate entity. The branch ministries, including the Ministry of Industry and Trade&#13;
and the Ministry of Agriculture, still have an inclination to interfere with firms on their operational level,&#13;
but they are gradually recognizing the need to adopt new roles as arm's length regulators and promoters of&#13;
their sectors. The Ministries of Finance and of Economy play an important role for the state enterprise&#13;
sector. They have largely been controlling the allocation of central credit resources except those that are&#13;
subject to auction. They also took a lead role in clearing inter-enterprise arrears, the last time in early 1994,&#13;
and have been preparing measures for the Government to use its resulting claims on defaulting enterprises&#13;
as a lever to force restructuring or liquidation. The Ministry of Economy is also the main Government&#13;
agency directly responsible for analyzing, developing, and monitoring policies and programs to support small&#13;
and medium enterprises. An important role is also envisaged for the Anti-Monopoly Committee. A revised&#13;
legal framework and improved operating procedures should put the Committee in a position to break up&#13;
monopolies and prevent the emergence of new ones; control dominant suppliers; prevent collusion, restrictive&#13;
vertical agreements, and other unfair trade practices; and protect consumers.&#13;
1.12          For the training of managers, several institutions are rapidly adjusting to the market&#13;
environment or have newly emerged. The Kazakh State Academy of Management and the Kazakh Institute&#13;
for Management and Economic Prognosis stand out among them. Several non-governmental institutions&#13;
support the private sector through representation of its interests and support services for their members. So-&#13;
called enterprise unions were created in 1990 to represent and assist small enterprises, non-agricultural&#13;
cooperatives, and small and cooperative agricultural enterprises, respectively. These unions are members&#13;
of the Congress of Entrepreneurs. Most large state enterprises are members of a Union of Industrialists and&#13;
Entrepreneurs.&#13;
1.13          In stark contrast to the socialist period, Kazakhstan's enterprises face today a competitive&#13;
environment, entirely different relative prices, drastic changes in demand, new markets and competitors, and&#13;
new kinds of Government policies and policy instruments. Yet, the largest part of their adjustment to this&#13;
new environment has yet to take place. As a result, enterprises have been suffering increasing distress,&#13;
burdening their creditors, and undermining the Government's economic stabilization efforts. In 1993, one&#13;
out of every three enterprises reported losses, despite the low energy prices and negative real interest rates&#13;
at the time. When credit policy was tightened in late 1993, enterprises rapidly accumulated arrears, with&#13;
the net arrears after clearing still equal to total bank credit. By now, the financial constraints have hardened.&#13;
At least 130 major enterprises have been closed, and many more have been operating only intermittently.&#13;
Their workers commonly remain formally employed and retain their access to the firms' social facilities, but&#13;
receive wages only for the days worked and often with long payment delays. Hidden unemployment has&#13;
been estimated at well over seven percent already in mid-1994, although only 0.7 percent were registered&#13;
as unemployed. Nonetheless the Government is committed to proceed with plans to force the severe&#13;
restructuring or liquidation of enterprises, starting with those which default on the short-term state credit that&#13;
refinanced their above-mentioned net inter-enterprise arrears.&#13;
1.14          Fundamental restructuring is now indeed needed in the enterprise sector for Kazakhstan's&#13;
economic reform program to succeed.  Without such restructuring, the enterprise sector would continue&#13;
burdening the economy with losses, arrears, and requests for subsidies and price distortions. Efficient&#13;
restructuring will require: (i) a market environment that sends relatively undistorted price signals, exerts&#13;
competitive pressures, and provides a conducive legal framework; (ii) effective enterprise governance&#13;
exercised by owners and creditors who aim at appropriate returns on investment and debt service, and&#13;
therefore force enterprises to restructure and to operate efficiently; and (iii) human and financial resources&#13;
to carry out the restructuring.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
1. Creating a Market Environmnent&#13;
1.15          Price Controls. The removal of price distortion in the form of state price controls has made&#13;
rapid progress, disrupted only by a brief period of temporary price and margin controls upon the introduction&#13;
of the national currency in late 1993: (i) The prices of all but a few goods have been liberalized. Price&#13;
administration applies still to electricity and heating, water and sewerage, natural gas, rents, railway and&#13;
telecommunication, and a few food and feed products. Price controls on petroleum and coal were removed&#13;
in April/May 1994. Procurement for "state needs" is by now largely confined to parts of the agricultural&#13;
sector, and increasingly uses negotiated prices. (ii) In foreign trade, the Government has reduced export&#13;
taxes to about 8 percent (unweighted) and import taxes to less than that; reduced the number of items subject&#13;
to export and import licensing to 35 and 10, respectively; and cut the number of items requiring export&#13;
quotas, with a part of these quotas being auctioned off. The remaining export quotas cover still much of&#13;
the mining, metallurgy, oil and gas sub-sectors, which are Kazakhstan's principal exporters, but the&#13;
Government envisages phasing them out in 1995. (iii) Lease fees for state-owned urban land and premises&#13;
are still negligent at least for state enterprises, while the prices for acquiring such lease rights are fixed.&#13;
Moreover, competitive procedures in the award of lease rights are not widely used. (iv) Interest rates are&#13;
largely free. Even the former state savings bank and other state banks are free to set their lending and&#13;
deposit rates. The interest rates resulting from auctions of central credit resources have reached positive&#13;
levels in real terms. Interest rates on those central credit resources that are still allocated rather than&#13;
auctioned are set close to the auction interest rate; they peaked at 37 percent per month, and became positive&#13;
in real terms in July 1994. Moreover, the auction mechanism is used for a rapidly rising percentage of new&#13;
central credit resources, with directed credit largely limited to agriculture. (v) Wages and salaries are&#13;
influenced by strong fiscal incentives for wages not to exceed a fixed multiple of the minimum wage. The&#13;
latter has dropped steeply in real terms in 1993, and more slowly in 1994. The Government also decided&#13;
to penalize any firm, private or public, whose wage bill exceeds the target rate of inflation. Some firms&#13;
seem to find ways, however, to compensate employees well beyond the reported wages, although those&#13;
practices clout cost accounting and often amount to asset stripping. Other firms have not been paying wages&#13;
for months.&#13;
1.16          Competition. The main market distortions stem today from monopolistic structures and&#13;
unfair trade practices. Even price and margin controls are now applied largely as a means of anti-monopoly&#13;
policy, to the point that the Price Committee has been merged with the Anti-Monopoly Committee.&#13;
(i) Due to the historically large scale-oriented industrial organization (and in part due to the definitions&#13;
used by the Anti-Monopoly Committee), well over thousand enterprises are registered as "dominant".&#13;
Since forced segmentation is costly and time-consuming, and anti-competitive practices are hard to&#13;
prove in the current environment, the Committee has resorted to price controls as its main policy&#13;
instrument. Donor assistance is helping to strengthen the Committee's capacity and legal basis for more&#13;
market-oriented means of competition policy.&#13;
(ii) Competition has been enhanced in transport and distribution structures, with the assistance of USAID&#13;
and the Bank. Most non-agricultural trucking companies have seen twenty percent of their truck fleet&#13;
auctioned off. Small retail and service enterprises are being auctioned off at a rate of 300 per month.&#13;
Wholesale concerns are being split up and privatized.&#13;
(iii) State structures that currently dominate many export and import areas, especially in agriculture and&#13;
metals, need to have their privileges revoked or be broken up. In 1994, about two thirds of the quotas&#13;
for metals, coal, oil and gas were reserved for seven designated trading companies. Inter-republican&#13;
trade continues to suffer from payment problems, lack of trust in contract enforcement, and price setting&#13;
under bilateral trade agreements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
(iv) In addition to these foreign trade areas, non-competitive situations prevail today mainly in the realm&#13;
of state holding companies and similar entities. There are more than eighty such structures, controlling&#13;
some 1,600 enterprises. Since the Government pursued not just better governance, but also scale&#13;
economies and venues for industrial policy, it has created most of these holdings on a horizontal, sub-&#13;
sectoral basis, and has even in some cases given them regulatory powers. This has been undermining&#13;
competition. Recognizing these problems, the Government has in late 1994 started dismantling several&#13;
holding companies and privatizing their individual subsidiaries, and transferring regulatory powers back&#13;
to ministries and the Anti-Monopoly Committee.&#13;
1.17         Legal Framework. Much attention has been paid to creating a conducive legal framework.&#13;
While this work continues, a further challenge is the creation of capacity to enforce the new legislation.&#13;
(i) A large number of new economic laws have been promulgated since 1991. They provide a first broad&#13;
basis for market transactions and property rights. However, this new legislation is often inconsistent&#13;
and incomplete. Various amendments or replacements of these early laws, including the Laws on&#13;
Foreign Investment, Collateral, and Bankruptcy, are now awaiting parliament approval. Additional new&#13;
legislation, including a new Civil Code that also covers contract law, has been prepared as well.&#13;
(ii) Law enforcement suffers from a severe shortage of legal professionals and effective settlement and&#13;
enforcement structures. Legal technical assistance from the Bank and USAID supports, therefore, not&#13;
only the law-making process but also improvements in jurisdiction and arbitration. A particular&#13;
challenge for the Government is the combat of organized crime that jeopardizes the rule of law as well&#13;
as market competition in the economy.&#13;
(iii) Critical legal infrastructure such as appropriate company, mortgage, share, and land registers is also&#13;
only beginning to emerge, but is receiving increasing donor assistance. For example, a central share&#13;
depository is being established, and the company register will henceforth been overseen by the newly&#13;
recreated National Securities Commission. A new accounting system for commercial enterprises is&#13;
being finalized, with its timetable for implementation determined by the vast training needs. The&#13;
accounting and audit profession is being organized with USAID and EU assistance.&#13;
2. Strengthening Enterprise Governance, especially through Privatization&#13;
1.18         Fundamental restructuring will only take place if enterprises are subject to effective&#13;
governance. Like governments elsewhere, the Government of Kazakhstan has proven to be an ineffective&#13;
owner of enterprises. Rapid privatization, and the emergence of new private firms, continues hence to be&#13;
among the Government's highest priorities. Creditors can also exercise governance of enterprises, and&#13;
indeed need to take a lead role in the case of many insolvent firms. Since the local banks are unaccustomed&#13;
to this role, and are either still small or themselves state-owned, they may play this role initially only for&#13;
small and medium-size firms. Special central institutions for debt resolution are needed for the largest and&#13;
most highly indebted defaulters.&#13;
1.19         Privatization. By early 1993, over 7,000 enterprises had been regarded as privatized.&#13;
However, few were substantial in size; commonly only a minority share was transferred; very few sales were&#13;
competitive, and most carried highly beneficial terms; and the recipients were almost exclusively the&#13;
employee collectives and managers. This was due in part to slow case-by-case procedures, lack of&#13;
privatization coupons and international tenders, and unclear property rights and institutional authority. An&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
entirely new National Privatization Program', drafted with Bank assistance, was therefore approved in March&#13;
1993, and the Privatization Law amended accordingly. SPC's status within the Government, and its&#13;
authority vis-a-vis oblast-level property committees, were enhanced. During the remainder of 1993,&#13;
extensive implementation legislation was drafted; the staff of property committees trained; information&#13;
processing and communication infrastructure installed; the public educated; privatization coupons distributed;&#13;
private investment funds licensed; and pilot efforts launched. By April 1994, one year after approval of the&#13;
new program, all components of the program (as explained below) had been rolled out nationwide. The key&#13;
is now the further strengthening of local implementation capacity; the flexible adjustment of the program in&#13;
view of the initial experience and changing circumstances, yet without jeopardizing the program's integrity&#13;
and consistency; improvements in agricultural privatization; and persistent rapid implementation of the&#13;
program despite opposition from traditional stakeholders and the reluctance of local administrations to submit&#13;
enterprises to the privatization program.&#13;
(i)  Small establishments with less than two hundred employees are being auctioned off on the oblast and&#13;
municipal level against a mix of cash and unutilized housing vouchers. SPC aims at transferring objects&#13;
with a minimum of restrictions, if any, on their future business activities, and at providing some&#13;
technical advice to the new owners immediately after sale. By October 1994, some 2,000 objects had&#13;
been disposed of under this program, with USAID and Bank assistance, and at least further 4,000&#13;
objects are earmarked for auction by end-1995. Further expansion of the program hinges on local&#13;
authorities disclosing state properties. To ensure a competitive environment especially for these small&#13;
enterprises, trucking and wholesale structures are also privatized on a priority basis. By October 1994,&#13;
SPC had auctioned off some 3,000 trucks. It plans to quickly sell the trucking firms with their&#13;
remaining fleets under the mass privatization program. SPC has been less successful to date auctioning&#13;
off warehouse space or, after segmentation, wholesale companies, in part due to opposition by the state&#13;
distribution sector.&#13;
(ii) Most non-agricultural firms with 200 to 5,000 employees are to be sold in 1994-96 through mass&#13;
privatization. More than ninety percent of the population have registered their privatization coupons,&#13;
which are denominated in "points" rather than currency and are not securitized. Step by step, the&#13;
citizens have been investing their coupons in one or several of the 169 licensed private investment&#13;
funds. SPC sells through auction the majority of shares of about one hundred firms per month. It sells&#13;
them to the investment funds against the coupons that they have been able to mobilize. Only further&#13;
ten percent of the shares have been given for free to the employees upon corporatization of their firms.&#13;
The remaining shares are earmarked for sale to investors against money.&#13;
In the first three months starting late April 1994, SPC sold 230 firms totalling about 100,000 employees&#13;
in five auctions. This speed would suffice to complete the sale of 2,000-2,500 firms by early 1996,&#13;
as planned. Moreover, the first auctions succeeded in covering firms from all regions (albeit with lower&#13;
participation of northern regions); selling also many subsidiaries of state holding companies and similar&#13;
structures; selling, in 60 percent of the cases, all shares offered; and receiving bids from most of the&#13;
169 investment funds. Due to changes in SPC's leadership, the auctions slowed down after July 1994,&#13;
but resumed since November 1994 with four further auctions. Some weaknesses, including the&#13;
following, need still to be rectified.  First, excessive restrictions on the share packages that an&#13;
investment fund can buy or own hinder it unduly in exercising govemance or reselling shares, and&#13;
1/ The Government has also started privatizing other assets that are not covered by the National Privatization Program, and not&#13;
regarded as a primary responsibility of SPC. For example, the Ministry of Geology has started an international tender program&#13;
for more than thirty mineral deposits. The Ministry of Oil and Gas is awarding exploitation rights for oil and gas fields to&#13;
foreign investors. The Ministry of Energy has recruited advisors for attracting private investment into the power sector. The&#13;
municipalities are selling various kinds of use rights for urban land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
hence also in generating cash income to be used for its fund management, dividends, and the&#13;
restructuring of firms in its portfolio. Resale of shares by the investment funds should also be a major&#13;
venue for foreign investors. Second, flaws in the earlier corporatization, the desire to segment&#13;
dominant firms prior to sale, and the need to clarify financial, environmental and social liabilities call&#13;
for more intensive preparation of firms for sale. Third, capital markets are being developed with&#13;
expediency to facilitate post-privatization trading.  Fourth, about a third of the mass privatized&#13;
enterprises to date were actually small-scale objects with less than 200 employees. Given SPC's limited&#13;
processing capacity, this slowed down the sale of medium and large scale enterprises that are supposed&#13;
to be mass privatized. Elaboration of these policy adjustments, as well as the continued implementation&#13;
of the mass privatization program, are supported by several donor agencies.&#13;
(iii) State farms are currently transformed through a process that gives each farm worker a long-term&#13;
transferable use right for a part of the farm's land. The farm without its land is usually transferred into&#13;
the ownership of its employee collective, except for some assets that are sold, leased out, or given as&#13;
incentives to the farm directors. Individual members of the collective have the right to opt out of the&#13;
farm by receiving a concrete piece of land corresponding to their share of the collective's total land,&#13;
and establish a farm on their own. By early 1994, some 15,000 individual and family farms were&#13;
established. Shares of agro-processing enterprises are usually transferred to their worker collectives,&#13;
as well as to agricultural suppliers against long-term supply contracts. These procedures for agro-&#13;
processors largely predate the National Privatization Program; since they tend to reduce competition&#13;
and raise questions about equity they are now under review, aimed at adding them into the above-&#13;
mentioned mass privatization program.&#13;
(iv) Very large enterprises (with more than 5,000 employees), and "special" enterprises requiring extensive&#13;
regulatory provisions (e.g., natural monopolies, exploiters of non-renewable natural resources, and&#13;
firms fulfilling mainly social functions) shall be privatized in a case-by-case process through&#13;
international tender and similar competitive procedures. Bank-funded consultants have helped refine&#13;
the policy and legal framework, and a Japanese grant is available to help SPC manage the case-by-case&#13;
program. Presently, about 130 firms are earmarked for case-by-case sale, many of them from the&#13;
mining/metallurgy and oil/gas sectors. The Government intends to also privatize power companies and&#13;
some further public service enterprises. It is estimated that SPC will be able to sell about fifteen to&#13;
twenty firms per year on a case-by-case basis. The Government, motivated largely by expected&#13;
divestiture revenue for the state budget, aims for a higher figure. So far, SPC has sold three large&#13;
firms to foreign investors through tender, and awarded one management contract to a foreign firm.&#13;
SPC is in the process of recruiting financial advisors for the sale of more than thirty further enterprises.&#13;
A constraint is the funding for fixed fees demanded by advisors for the preparation and sale of objects&#13;
whose chances of successful sale do not appear certain. The EU and the French Government have&#13;
indicated their readiness to help finance such costs for a total of some ten to twelve cases over two&#13;
years. The Bank would provide assistance under this Project (see paras. 3.6-3.7).&#13;
1.20          State Enterprise Governance. Although the Government is still the owner of most large&#13;
and medium-size enterprises, it lacks some basic instruments to exercise effective governance. SPC has been&#13;
able to formally corporatize almost 2,000 state enterprises, and thus to delineate their property rights and&#13;
liabilities, clarify their legal status, determine the rights and responsibilities of managers and owners, and&#13;
provide for supervisory boards. But there is no uniform system of financial reporting, monitoring, audit,&#13;
performance targets, and incentives that would be appropriate in a market economy. Moreover, the&#13;
Government decided not to collect any dividends, thus reinvesting profits into their sources irrespective of&#13;
expected returns. In 1993, the Government has then created about eighty state holding companies and&#13;
similar structures, combining some 1,600 enterprises. The Government hoped that this intermediate&#13;
institutional layer would exercise governance more effectively, in a more business-oriented manner, and with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
less operational interference from line ministries. However, as mentioned earlier, the Government's&#13;
concurrent objectives of increasing scale economies and conducting industrial policy, as well as pressures&#13;
from stakeholders in the administration and in important enterprises, undermined this objective. The holding&#13;
companies were formed on a sub-sector basis, thereby often restricting competition; their executives are&#13;
mostly former ministry officials; and various ministries are using their Board membership and other&#13;
influences to interfere ad hoc into enterprise operations. Moreover, the holding companies themselves are&#13;
not subject to effective governance by the state who owns them, resulting in a lack of accountability. The&#13;
Government is now dismantling a number of these holding companies, and considers establishing a new&#13;
entity to exercise the state's ownership rights, other than the right of their disposal which would remain at&#13;
SPC. Assistance to improve such governance of still unprivatized enterprises is available under the Bank's&#13;
existing Technical Assistance Loan.&#13;
1.21          Governance Exercised by Creditors. Governance can also be exercised, and restructuring&#13;
forced upon management, by the creditors of enterprises. In insolvent enterprises in market economies, the&#13;
creditors' powers prevail commonly over those of the owners.  Some control of enterprises by their&#13;
creditors, aimed at forcing their restructuring or liquidation, can also be desirable where enterprises are&#13;
economically viable but too heavily burdened with overdue debt to be privatizable without major financial&#13;
restructuring.&#13;
1.22          In Kazakhstan, the number of insolvent enterprises is rapidly growing under the increasingly&#13;
restrained monetary policy pursued under the IMF Standby Arrangement. Among their creditors are&#13;
suppliers, banks, and the fiscal and social security authorities. Moreover, the Government assumed net&#13;
claims on enterprises resulting from an inter-enterprise arrears clearing exercise in the first quarter of 1994.&#13;
The banks have still limited capacity for forcing and overseeing the restructuring of their clients.&#13;
Widespread exercise of governance by suppliers appears undesirable for structural reasons. Therefore,&#13;
commercial banks and suppliers alone can not be relied upon to exercise governance over all defaulting&#13;
debtors. Special central institutions are being established by the Government and by commercial entities to&#13;
assume other creditors' claims on defaulting enterprises, and to force and oversee the restructuring of the&#13;
latter.&#13;
(i) Since the clearing exercise in early 1994, supplier enterprises have again accumulated substantial&#13;
overdue receivables. However, these suppliers are commonly still state-owned and suffer hence&#13;
themselves from weak governance, or they are foreign entities. Moreover, widespread control of firms&#13;
by their suppliers may not be a desirable industrial organization, especially since it could hamper&#13;
competition. The creditor role of enterprise could be reduced in future if the banks took greater&#13;
responsibilities in the payments system, by guaranteeing payment orders as a condition for their&#13;
settlement.&#13;
(ii) Commercial banks carry a large number of non-performing loans in their portfolios. With the help of&#13;
EBRD, five banks (Turan-, Kredsoc-, Kramds-, Center-, and Kazkommerzbank) are now establishing&#13;
internal work-out units to force defaulting debtors to restructure or liquidate. NBK considers making&#13;
the introduction of such units mandatory for all banks. Bank twinning arrangements envisaged under&#13;
this Project, and an EU-sponsored advisory service for smaller banks, would support this process.&#13;
Even with special work-out units, however, the ability of the local banks to exercise effective&#13;
governance over distressed clients will remain limited. They are still inexperienced in this activity, and&#13;
they are either relatively small or suffer from various governance and management problems&#13;
themselves.  Large enterprises with the largest non-performing debts, as well as public service&#13;
enterprises who can not easily be downsized or liquidated, need therefore be handled by special&#13;
structures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9-&#13;
(iii) Several central institutions are being established with the purpose to force major insolvent enterprises&#13;
to restructure, or to liquidate them. To deal with up to forty distressed non-agricultural enterprises with&#13;
the largest outstanding net debts, the Government is establishing a so-called Rehabilitation Trust that&#13;
will assume the claims on these firms; this institution would be further supported in its operation under&#13;
this Project (see paras. 3.18-3.25). In the agricultural sector, many non-performing loans are being&#13;
moved from Agroprombank to a special Agricultural Support Fund. In addition, the Government&#13;
encourages the establishment of profit-oriented turnaround funds that would buy the debt of a few&#13;
illiquid but highly promising enterprises with the objective to convert debt into equity, restructure the&#13;
firms, and sell them; the EBRD is preparing the establishment and financing of such a fund.&#13;
3. Human and Financial Resources for Enterprise Restructuring&#13;
1.23           Skilled human resources are needed to plan enterprise restructuring or liquidation; carry it&#13;
out; and operate the firm  profitably thereafter.  Similarly, financial resources are needed to keep the&#13;
respective firms liquid while the restructuring is being planned and implemented; undertake the various&#13;
restructuring measures, including debt restructuring; and operate and expand the firm once the main sources&#13;
of losses have been eradicated.&#13;
1.24          Human Resources for Restructuring. Qualified human resources are needed to undertake&#13;
basic viability assessments, elaborate restructuring plans or liquidation concepts, and implement the&#13;
adjustment measures, including debt restructuring, staff lay-offs, and disposal of businesses or assets. In&#13;
Kazakhstan, these skills and experience are still in very short supply, yet the need to restructure a large part&#13;
of the country's more than 6,000 significant enterprises is urgent. With the help of various donors, a wide&#13;
range of management training courses is being offered in Kazakhstan. This Project would help support an&#13;
intensive tour program for managers to study management practices in Western companies, including their&#13;
experience with restructuring (see paras. 3.12-3.17). Small and medium private enterprises can also obtain&#13;
advice on restructuring from a network of oblast-level business development centers that are assisted by&#13;
American business people recruited by the Peace Corps, and by a Business Communication Center that is&#13;
assisted by the EU. For very large and complex enterprises, more specialized skills will be required. The&#13;
Government is establishing a Restructuring Advisory Unit, affilitated to the Ministry of Economy, to help&#13;
companies prepare viability assessments and restructuring plans. This Unit, with Bank assistance, will draw&#13;
largely on local and foreign consultants to train the local consultants and Unit staff, and supplement them&#13;
with specialized expertise (see paras. 3.8-3.11). The Unit will first focus on the enterprises whose debts will&#13;
have been transferred to the above-mentioned Rehabilitation Trust, since these are very urgent and sizable&#13;
cases, and since being highly insolvent makes it difficult for these firms to employ advisors otherwise. The&#13;
Government envisages creating, in addition, special units for the rapid liquidation of clearly non-viable state&#13;
enterprises, and for the restructuring of strategic public service enterprises.&#13;
1.25          Financial Resources for Restructuring. Firms that seek funding for restructuring have in&#13;
principle access to an ECU 100 million credit line of EBRD for medium-size export-oriented enterprises,&#13;
an additional upcoming EBRD facility for enterprise restructuring, a Central Asian American Enterprise&#13;
Fund, and a U.S.-funded defense conversion facility. The Bank has started preparing a Project to provide&#13;
a credit (and potentially equity) facility for private enterprises. For local cost funding, the main financing&#13;
sources are still central credit resources extended or guaranteed by the authorities within the framework of&#13;
the IMF standby agreement. Local banks and other local creditors will have to bear part of the burden from&#13;
restructuring bad debts. Moreover, the development of commercial banks, which will be discussed below,&#13;
shall enhance banks' ability to lend to promising enterprises emerging from work-outs. The main sources&#13;
for investment in new assets need to be foreign and local private investors, however. For this reason, and&#13;
because the state has proven to be an ineffective owner, every restructuring of a state enterprise,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS IN THE ENTERPRISE SECTOR&#13;
Kazakhstan faces severe problems of environmental degradation. Water resources are scarce in the country, and&#13;
this problem is compounded by localized pollution of water sources. Soil degradation is an equally important&#13;
problem. Industrialization and rapid population growth have contributed both to air and water pollution. Among&#13;
stationary sources, major polluters are power plants and metallurgical facilities. Mining contributes especially to&#13;
ground water pollution and, in some cases, to radioactive contamination. The deterioration of environmental&#13;
conditions has reached disaster levels in nine geographical areas, and is imposing immense economic and social&#13;
costs in many others as well. Moreover, the country's energy consumption is as high as that of countries with a&#13;
much higher industrial output. Air pollution of industrial and automotive origin (smog, heavy metals, CO,&#13;
benzopyrene, and particulates) is highly localized and affects even important urban areas like Almaty, Karaganda,&#13;
Chimkent, and Pavlodar. Seven large municipalities with a population of nearly I million do not have waste water&#13;
treatment plants, and some others have some plants under construction but not completed. The authorities report&#13;
that less than half of some 1,200 major industrial plants are equipped with functioning pre-treatment facilities. As&#13;
a result, the contamination of surface waters by heavy metals and chlorinated hydrocarbons is a major problem. In&#13;
1990, for example, nearly 4,800 of 5,500 inspected plants were found in violation of environmental standards, and&#13;
43 thereof in such serious violation that a production stop was ordered.&#13;
The degradation of the environment in the Republic can be attributed in large part to the following factors: past&#13;
economic policies that promoted quantitative targets without regard to sustainability; ineffective enforcement of&#13;
environmental laws and standards; overall, an inefficient system of environmental management; and lack of public&#13;
participation in environmental protection. The economic transition has added problems caused by delays in&#13;
adjusting the legal and regulatory framework, as well as enforcement practices, to the market economic&#13;
environment.&#13;
The Law on Environmental Protection in the Kazakh SSR (June 18, 1991) appears on the whole to be an&#13;
appropriate instrument upon which to construct an effective regulatory program. It covers the protection of land,&#13;
air, water, forestry, wildlife, and natural resource deposits. In addition to permits and environmental reviews and&#13;
impact assessments, the legislation features principles which are based on a "polluter pays" principle through the&#13;
use of pollution charges. The operation of the charge system, and the capacities for managing the related&#13;
Environmental Fund, need to be strengthened, however.  Although principles and intentions expressed in&#13;
Kazakhstan's environmental law are often at par with international standards, the legislation seems to lack&#13;
mechanisms to ensure that delays in implementation will be reviewed and rectified. The responsibilities for&#13;
monitoring and enforcement are not clearly delineated. The environmental monitoring system involves several&#13;
institutions (Kazhydromet, Academy of Sciences, State Sanitary Services, etc.) and is based on a complex and&#13;
cumbersome approach; a more streamlined and better coordinated system is warranted. The State Committee on&#13;
Environmental Protection, created in 1988, was reorganized in 1990 and again in early 1992, becoming the&#13;
Ministry of Ecology and Bio-Resources (MEBR). The ministry is entrusted with setting the Republic's&#13;
environmental policy; coordinating environmental activities of other public and private entities; and monitoring and&#13;
enforcing compliance. Significant progress is being made in developing the institutional capacity of the ministry&#13;
and related institutions, and is supported through training and advice under the Bank's Technical Assistance Loan,&#13;
but it will take considerable time and effort to build the capacity needed to address the immense environmental&#13;
challenges of Kazakhstan. As market liberalization, privatization and restructuring proceed in industry and&#13;
agriculture, MEBR needs to ensure that environmental issues related to both past and future activities are given&#13;
adequate consideration.&#13;
Enterprise privatization and restructuring are a challenge, but also a window of opportunity, for environmental&#13;
protection. Environmental problems could worsen, for example, where distressed enterprises cease operating&#13;
pollution control or treatment facilities, new facilities and products are brought on stream, or private ownership&#13;
requires changes in regulatory enforcement practices. But environmental issues are also gaining attention:&#13;
Potential buyers of enterprises are concerned about environmental liabilities, investors ask for predictability in&#13;
environmental regulations, and enterprise managers use restructuring as an opportunity to address their'plants'&#13;
environmental problems. Given the status of equipment and production management in Kazakhstan today,&#13;
efficiency-enhancing measures and new technologies will in many cases reduce pollution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
including those forced by the Rehabilitation Trust, should aim at privatizing the firms before they start to&#13;
invest in major new assets. Some viable enterprises are too highly indebted or burdened with non-viable&#13;
activities, though, to be privatized without any prior "passive" restructuring.&#13;
1.26          Extensive resources will also be needed to bear and alleviate the social costs of enterprise-&#13;
level adjustment. The social situation has already become more fragile. An estimated 550,000 people were&#13;
without work by September 1994. Fewer than 50,000 people received unemployment compensation,&#13;
however. The minimum pensions and other benefits have been adjusted only sporadically to the increases&#13;
in cost of living, and yet the financial viability of the pension system is in jeopardy. The Government has&#13;
introduced several measures to shield the most vulnerable groups like disabled people, single mothers, and&#13;
large families. It has also encouraged the rapid growth of private vegetable, garden and dacha plots, now&#13;
numbering 5 million. It is now working with the Bank on a program to divest and safeguard vital social&#13;
facilities that hitherto belonged to state enterprises. A Social Protection Project that has been appraised&#13;
recently would help strengthen the network of employment offices and the system of unemployment benefits,&#13;
and divest and rationalize social assets in some districts.&#13;
C. Status and Reform of the Financial Sector&#13;
1.27          The banking sector consists of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NBK); the&#13;
former State Savings Bank, which has since then been transformed into a common joint stock commercial&#13;
bank (People's Bank); three recently created specialized state banks (export/import, housing, and&#13;
development bank); and about 160 commercial banks. Most of these commercial banks are very small&#13;
institutions that were set up in 1991-93 by public enterprises in order to get direct access to highly subsidized&#13;
centralized credit resources allocated by NBK. About 50 of the commercial banks were privately owned&#13;
from their start, and 15 further ones are joint ventures, subsidiaries and branches of foreign banks that are&#13;
mainly active in external trade finance and services. The sector is largely dominated by the ten largest&#13;
institutions (more than 75 percent of total assets, by mid-1994). They consist of the five former specialized&#13;
banks (People's, Agroprom-, Turan-, Kredsoc- and Alembank, which focused historically on households,&#13;
agriculture, industry, small enterprises, and foreign trade, respectively) and a nucleus of rapidly growing&#13;
new private banks that strive towards international standards.&#13;
1.28          The NBK, which became fully independent from the Government in 1994, is increasingly&#13;
concentrating on genuine central bank functions. It has been adopting market-economic monetary and&#13;
financial sector policies, and adjusting its organizational structure and skills mix to it. In addition to its 386&#13;
headquarter positions it has also some 8,000 employees in the local branches, many of whom are still&#13;
involved in keeping the customer and general ledger accounts of commercial banks and state enterprises.&#13;
1.29          A particular bottleneck in the financial sector, with direct implications also for the enterprise&#13;
sector, is the payments system. Nineteen regional clearing centers are presently supporting a daily average&#13;
of approximately 200,000 intra-bank and 70,000 inter-bank financial obligations. In 1994, inter-oblast&#13;
transactions took up to fourteen workdays to settle, resulting in a high negative float, a net reduction in&#13;
banks' monetary assets, and reduced availability of working capital to enterprises. Due to deficient data&#13;
processing capacities and linkages between regional centers, the settlement balances were "netted out" only&#13;
once a month, forcing banks to maintain unnecessarily high levels of reserves, and resulting in ineffective&#13;
liquidity management. With these weaknesses, the payments system also has not allowed NBK to adequately&#13;
oversee credit and liquidity risks and to regulate the financial conduct and viability of the banks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
1.30           The 1992-93 period2 was characterized, for the banking sector, by four major features: (i)&#13;
a rapid shrinking of its deposit base, that declined from 96 percent of GDP at the end of 1991 to 28 percent&#13;
at the end of 1993, mainly due to the impact of highly negative real interest rates; (ii) a stabilization of its&#13;
credit portfolio at around 100 percent of GDP, reflecting the impact of an accommodating monetary policy&#13;
that translated into an extensive allocation of refinancing facilities by NBK, mainly in the form of directed&#13;
credit programs. As a consequence, the percentage of bank credit refinanced by NBK resources more than&#13;
doubled to about 60 percent, and the deposit to credit ratio declined from nearly 100 percent to about 28&#13;
percent during this two year period; (iii) a very large proportion of insider lending to bank shareholders,&#13;
given the connection between the potential amount of NBK refinancing facilities available for each bank and&#13;
the level of its paid-in capital; and (iv) a very low repayment rate of both the borrowers vis-a-vis their banks&#13;
and the banks vis-a-vis NBK, which translated into a quasi-automatic rolling over of both these credits and&#13;
their refinancing. Although only a small proportion of loans refinanced by centralized credit resources was&#13;
de jure guaranteed by the Government, these programs were to be approved by the Council of Ministers,&#13;
and the intermediation margin of banks on such loans was limited to 3 percentage points. As a consequence,&#13;
the banking sector continued to behave mainly as a simple administrative intermediary and was, de facto,&#13;
the main conduit for channeling subsidies, in particular the important inflation subsidy, to loss-making public&#13;
enterprises and the agricultural sector. This passive role of the banking sector was also illustrated by its&#13;
automatic forwarding of payment orders issued by enterprises in the interbank payment system, regardless&#13;
of their financial condition, and by repeated clearings of arrears accumulated in the system by injections of&#13;
liquidity from NBK.&#13;
1.31           Following the introduction of the national currency, the Tenge, in November 1993, the&#13;
monetary environment of the banking sector, as well as its role, started to change markedly. The authorities&#13;
tightened substantially the monetary policy with the objectives to reduce inflation and to instill financial&#13;
discipline in the sector. Measures implemented include mainly: (i) a substantial reduction in the growth rate&#13;
of liquidities provided by NBK, together with a sharp increase in reserve requirements; (ii) the enhancement&#13;
of the role of the auction system for the allocation of NBK credits, through which about 50 percent of NBK&#13;
facilities were channeled during the first half of 1994, and about 75 percent during the last quarter of the&#13;
year, compared to around 10 percent in 1993; (iii) the alignment of NBK refinancing rates to the level&#13;
market-determined by the auction scheme, which is positive in real terms since mid-1994 with the exception&#13;
of an agricultural credit program, and the complete liberalization of lending and deposit rates; and (iv) a&#13;
large increase in deposit rates offered by the savings bank, that was made possible by the completion of the&#13;
financial compensation for its assets that were frozen following the breakdown of the Soviet Union. In&#13;
parallel, the authorities have accelerated the preparation and initiated the implementation of structural&#13;
measures required to strengthen the financial and institutional condition of the sector over the medium term.&#13;
In this context, NBK is finalizing the preparation of a comprehensive reform program which aims at enabling&#13;
and inciting the banking sector to play an active role in the enforcement of a hard budget constraint on the&#13;
enterprise sector, and in the efficient mobilization and allocation of financial resources'.&#13;
1.32           Due to the difficult macroeconomic environment in which it operates, in particular the poor&#13;
condition of the enterprise sector, as well as its own institutional and financial weaknesses, the adjustment&#13;
process of the banking sector to this new environment is difficult. The tightening of monetary policy and&#13;
the increased financial discipline imposed by NBK on the banking sector has been translating, in the first&#13;
stage, into its further shrinking and a rapid deterioration in both its solvency and its liquidity. This reflects&#13;
2/ The Bank's "Kazakhstan Economic Report" (Report No. 12856-KZ), dated July 7, 1994, gives a further description of&#13;
developments in the financial sector during this period.&#13;
3/ Many structural issues faced by the sector were presented, with detailed reform proposals, in the Bank report entitled "The&#13;
Banking Sector at a Crossroads: A Blueprint for Reform", issued in August 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
mainly, as experienced in other transitional economies, delays in the adjustment of the banking sector itself,&#13;
and the difficulties it faces to enforce financial discipline in the enterprise sector.  The anticipated&#13;
deterioration in its liquidity situation is confirmed by the increase in the number of "problem banks" during&#13;
1994, and by the amplitude of the systemic liquidity crisis that emerged in the payment system in early 1994.&#13;
In order to avoid a collapse of the economy at that time, NBK and the Government intervened massively&#13;
through the provision of state guaranteed credit to net debtors emerging from a debt clearing operation, and&#13;
the issuance of bonds to creditors, respectively. Portfolio reviews of ten large banks performed in late 1994&#13;
indicate also that the sector can be considered, in principle, as largely technically insolvent, even if all loans&#13;
refinanced by non-auctioned centralized credit resources were to be considered guaranteed by the&#13;
Government.&#13;
1.33          The main elements of the medium-term reform strategy envisaged by the authorities, for&#13;
which action has already been initiated, include: the overhauling of the inter-bank payments system; the&#13;
development of a conducive environment for banking, especially a sound and efficient legal, regulatory and&#13;
supervisory framework; and the governance and restructuring of formerly specialized banks.&#13;
1. Payment System Reform&#13;
1.34          Measures introduced to initiate the reform of the inter-bank payments system aim at restoring&#13;
its integrity and at making it the first source of financial discipline in the enterprise and banking sectors.&#13;
In order to avoid further large accumulations of inter-enterprise arrears through the system, the use of&#13;
appropriate procedures and payment instruments has been initiated. The remuneration of banks' compulsory&#13;
reserves, at half the refinance rate, has been introduced together with the progressive consolidation of banks'&#13;
branches reserve and correspondent accounts with NBK into a single account, with the objective to enhance,&#13;
and facilitate the management of, banks' liquidity . The use of irrevocable letters of credit as payment&#13;
instruments is being facilitated and encouraged. NBK further plans to require banks to fully guarantee the&#13;
clearing of payment orders that they forward in the system. Treasury bills auctions have also been&#13;
introduced with the objective for the banks to be in a position to acquire collateral required to borrow from&#13;
a lombard window to cover their liquidity needs. In parallel, NBK has started studying the legal, regulatory,&#13;
institutional, and technological aspects of reforming the payments system for the longer term.&#13;
1.35          As a short-term measure, NBK is enhancing some critical elements of the existing, old&#13;
computer and communication technology within the confines of the existing accounting system, payment&#13;
instruments, and general system architecture. This "interim system" is to be in place by mid-1995. It will&#13;
mainly accelerate data transmission by computerizing NBK's 270 district-level cash centers and enhancing&#13;
communication facilities at the oblast-level centers, thus reducing the float in the payment system. It will&#13;
in the process also facilitate the nationwide consolidation of correspondent accounts with NBK, and help&#13;
maintain a more up-to-date inter-bank indebtedness matrix, thus allowing better liquidity management by&#13;
banks and monetary management by NBK. At the same time, NBK with Bank assistance is designing a new&#13;
"long-term system". This modem system will accommodate a wider variety of payment instruments, a new&#13;
accounting system, broader information requirements, and rapid growth in transaction volumes. Moreover,&#13;
it should be able to process, when desired, transactions on a real-time basis, and with higher security.&#13;
NBK's system is expected to process high-value transactions, the settlement of already netted amounts that&#13;
result from inter-bank clearing, and -- while such inter-bank clearing is yet limited in scope -- part of the&#13;
low-value transactions on a gross basis (see also paras. 3.36-3.41). For inter-bank clearing, some early&#13;
efforts are under way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
2. Reform of the Banking Environment&#13;
1.36         Action is being taken to improve the environment of banking activities. Revisions of the&#13;
National Bank Law and Banking Law that were enacted in 1993 have been prepared for Parliament decision&#13;
before mid-1995. They are expected, among other things, to enhance NBK's intervention capacities towards&#13;
delinquent banks, and facilitate the protection of banks' interests against defaulting borrowers. Also at an&#13;
advanced stage of preparation are new laws on collatoral, non-bank financial institutions, and some financial&#13;
instruments. A new Securities Law has been passed recently.&#13;
1.37         New bank accounting and auditing standards based on international ones have been prepared&#13;
by NBK. The new chart of accounts is currently being tested in several banks, and will be mandatory for&#13;
all banks by January 1, 1996. Moreover, intensive training programs for bank staff, and an advisory unit&#13;
located in the Bankers' Association, have started with the assistance of bilateral and multilateral donor&#13;
agencies.&#13;
1.38         Bank licensing and prudential regulations are being strengthened and their enforcement is&#13;
progressively implemented. The minimum capital requirements have been denominated in US dollar and&#13;
raised to US$1.5 million for new banks which intend to open branches, collect households deposits or make&#13;
foreign exchange transactions, and to US$0.5 million for other banks. Existing banks have to comply with&#13;
these requirements before the end of 1995. The minimum capital adequacy ratio on risk weighted assets has&#13;
been set at 8 percent; the reserve and liquidity ratios have been raised to 30 percent; and ceilings on single&#13;
exposures, insider lending and foreign exchange positions have been introduced. A compulsory loan&#13;
classification system is being prepared. The stricter enforcement of these prudential regulations has already&#13;
translated into a marked reduction in the licensing of new banks and an increase in bank closures, and is&#13;
expected to lead to a drastic reduction in the number of banking institutions over the next quarters through&#13;
mergers and closures. Access to NBK's credit auction system has also been limited to banks that meet&#13;
minimum capital, capital adequacy, liquidity and reserve requirements, and is updated on a monthly basis.&#13;
At times, during 1994, only one out of every three banks was allowed to participate in the auctions. These&#13;
access requirements are being progressively tightened to come in line with regulatory standards. In parallel,&#13;
NBK's Banking Supervision Department is being reinforced with substantial technical assistance and training&#13;
(see also paras. 3.34-3.35).&#13;
1.39         NBK has also commissioned, with Bank funding, comprehensive in-depth studies of the ten&#13;
largest banks; the last of these reports should be completed in final form by April 1995. These studies cover&#13;
institutional and financial aspects, and are not only diagnostic but also strategic in nature. They will provide&#13;
a basis for the further development, or restructuring, of these banks. To help implement such commercial&#13;
bank strengthening, the Bank and the EBRD would help fund intensive multi-year assistance arrangements&#13;
with foreign banks or consultants for several local banks (see paras. 3.26-3.33).&#13;
3. Governance and Restructuring of Specialized Banks&#13;
1.40         The above-mentioned actions are being complemented by measures aimed at enhancing the&#13;
governance of public sector banks and at restructuring formerly specialized banks. The voting rights of all&#13;
public enterprises in banking institutions have been taken over by the State Property Committee, and are&#13;
exercised by the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
1.41         Banks have also been requested to set up work-out units to manage their non-performing&#13;
loans and play a more active role in the restructuring of loss-making enterprises. Two former specialized&#13;
banks, Turanbank and Kredsocbank, have already started to implement such units with the assistance of the&#13;
EBRD and the United Kingdom Know How Fund. The isolation of up to forty non-agricultural enterprises&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
with the largest outstanding arrears from the rest of the banking sector through the creation of a&#13;
Rehabilitation Trust, and the subsequent liquidation or passive restructuring and privatization of the debtors,&#13;
will help the commercial banks to recover financially and better manage their portfolios (see paras. 3.18-&#13;
3.25). In parallel, Agroprombank is being relieved of a large part of its non-performing loan portfolio,&#13;
through the transfer to a special Agricultural Support Fund that will try to collect those loans. Plans for a&#13;
governmental liquidation unit for clearly non-viable state enterprises of medium to large size, and profit-&#13;
oriented restructuring funds (which were also mentioned above in paras. 1.24-1.25), are further measures&#13;
to relieve the banking sector from highly distressed debtor enterprises.&#13;
1.42          The progressive privatization of their shareholders, and the capital increases called for by&#13;
the stricter minimum capital requirements, are leading to a progressive privatization of the large public sector&#13;
banks. In parallel, more narrowly defined specialized banking functions are transferred to new, fully state-&#13;
owned banks. Sberbank has been transformed into a commercial bank (People's Bank), and is expected no&#13;
longer to enjoy a state deposit guarantee or other major privileges. The bank shall be privatized after some&#13;
prior restructuring, including rationalization of its branch network. The fledgling housing finance business&#13;
of Sberbank was transferred to a new state-owned Housing Construction Bank. Alembank, the bank&#13;
formerly specialized in foreign financing, has been split into a common, private owned, commercial bank&#13;
and a state-owned Eximbank. Kredsocbank, which was in charge of the construction and small enterprise&#13;
sectors, has largely privatized itself through the issuances of new shares. At the same time, the Government&#13;
has created a development bank and a first leasing company.&#13;
1.43          What might emerge, after some years of intensive shake-out, restructuring, and institutional&#13;
strengthening, is a banking sector characterized by: (i) a few first-tier "international standard" commercial&#13;
banks, with and without foreign ownership and little, if any, residual state ownership; this could also include&#13;
some older but by then profoundly restructured banks like the People's Bank and Turanbank; (ii) a few&#13;
specialized republican banks with major state ownership, for example, banks for trade finance and related&#13;
guarantees, development finance, housing loans, and perhaps large agricultural credits; and (iii) some smaller&#13;
banks, including rural and cooperative entities, concentrating on market niches and investment banking.&#13;
II. BANK GROUP'S ASSISTANCE AND STRATEGY&#13;
A. Past Bank Lending and Strategy in the Financial and Enterprise Sectors&#13;
2.1           The Government of Kazakhstan is undergoing a fundamental transformation towards a market&#13;
economy with predominantly private ownership. A core element of the transition is a course of rapid&#13;
structural reform in the financial and enterprise sectors. The Bank has been helping identify and prepare&#13;
many of the key action programs of this reform. The proposed Financial and Enterprises Development&#13;
Project would play a vital role in supporting the actual implementation of these measures in the two sectors.&#13;
2.2           This Project would come in stage III of a four-stage sequence of Bank operations in the&#13;
enterprise and financial sectors, as outlined below.&#13;
(i) Stage I: Formulation of. and Aereement on, Reform Strategy. In FY 93, the Bank prepared a first&#13;
Country Economic Memorandum, as well as a series of sector reports and technical cooperation studies&#13;
on privatization, foreign investment policy, financial sector reform, energy sector re-organization, and&#13;
the social safety net. Their policy recommendations were then reflected in the Government's agreement&#13;
with the IMF on support under the Structural Transformation Facility and, subsequently, a stand-by&#13;
arrangement, and formed the basis of the Bank's Economic Rehabilitation Loan. In June 1994, a&#13;
second Country Economic Memorandum was issued, with a focus on the costs of restructuring. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
policy dialogue with the authorities has then proceeded in the context of preparing a Structural&#13;
Adjustment Loan (FY 95), which concentrates on further market development and intensified enterprise&#13;
restructuring in the agriculture and industry sectors. A Financial Sector Adjustment Loan is envisaged&#13;
for FY 96.&#13;
(ii) Stage 11: Preparation of Detailed Programs, and Initial Institution Building. A large part of the Bank's&#13;
Technical Assistance Loan of US$38 million, approved by the Board in August 1993, addresses&#13;
enterprise and financial sector reforms. The Project has been helping to prepare in-depth diagnostic&#13;
studies (such as on the ten largest commercial banks) and detailed action programs (for instance, for&#13;
the long-term payment system, the privatization of very large firms, and the establishment of the&#13;
Rehabilitation Trust).  That Project aims also at strengthening institutional capacity in areas like&#13;
privatization, anti-monopoly policy, foreign investment, and on-site bank supervision. The Project also&#13;
removes bottlenecks in the old payments system through some rapid interim measures. In addition, the&#13;
Bank assisted the country's privatization of small-scale enterprises, trucks, and warehouses with the&#13;
help of a USAID grant, and tested a study tour program for enterprise managers through two initial&#13;
tours on a pilot basis in June 1994 under an IDF grant.&#13;
(iii) Stage III: Implementation Support for Detailed Action Programs and Institutional Infrastructure. This&#13;
Financial and Enterprises Development Project would help to implement the results of the phase II&#13;
studies, plans, and pilot tests. It would do so with regard to the modernization and restructuring of&#13;
banks, installation of a long-term payment system, resolution of bad debt, restructuring or liquidation&#13;
of large insolvent firms, and study tours for managers. In addition, the Project would continue the&#13;
Bank's support for bank supervision and enterprise privatization. This Project would be complemented&#13;
by a recently appraised Social Protection Project to strengthen the network of employment offices and&#13;
help implement the divestiture of critical social assets.&#13;
(iv) Stage IV: Credit Lines for Enterprise-Level Adjustment and Growth. The next stage of the Bank's&#13;
support in the enterprise and financial sectors could consist of the provision of term credit, equity&#13;
capital, and some technical assistance for post-privatization restructuring and new private investments.&#13;
A Private Enterprise Support Project along these lines is being identified. It would complement an&#13;
EBRD-funded credit line for export-oriented small and medium enterprises, a planned IFC credit line&#13;
and credit guarantee for trade finance, and a U.S.-funded Central Asian American Enterprise Fund.&#13;
This Financial and Enterprises Development Project would play a critical role in developing sound and&#13;
capable commercial banks that could on-lend such working capital and investment credit. It would also&#13;
improve corporate governance through privatization; build local consulting expertise for restructuring;&#13;
and familiarize 160 dynamic enterprise managers to modern business practices.&#13;
2.3            The IFC approved investments in a joint venture bank with ABN AMRO and in the oil sector&#13;
(Kazgermunai). The IFC is now preparing, among other things, a credit line for trade financing and a&#13;
related credit guarantee facility, as well as an equity fund; several investments in gold mining; and advisory&#13;
services to a large privatization case. The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) has been reviewing&#13;
the environment and legislation for foreign investment in Kazakhstan.&#13;
2.4            The Bank has been coordinating its activities closely on the management and task level with&#13;
other donors. The EBRD, EU, and USAID, in particular, are providing support to the financial and&#13;
enterprise sectors, but the magnitude and urgency of the reform effort requires the additional support by the&#13;
Bank.  The above-mentioned donor agencies are expected to support privatization, bank twinning&#13;
arrangements, and bank supervision in parallel to this Bank Loan, or at least closely coordinated with it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
B. Lessons from Experience&#13;
2.5           Bank experience shows that fundamental policy reforms such as those aimed at the&#13;
restructuring of financial and enterprise sectors for the transition to a market economy require substantial&#13;
capacity building, implementation advice, and market infrastructure investments in order to be effectively&#13;
and sustainably implemented. Experience further suggests that it is important to maintain the momentum,&#13;
consistency, quality, and volume of the external support. Finally, the close inter-linkages between the&#13;
reforms in the financial and the enterprise sectors need to be taken into account in the Bank's lending&#13;
program and project design. The Bank is supporting these reforms in Kazakhstan through a rapid sequence&#13;
of projects focused on (i) fast-disbursing policy support, (ii) initial institution-building, (iii) program&#13;
implementation support and market infrastructure investments, and (iv) enterprise-level investments.&#13;
2.6           Technical assistance and training to underpin financial and enterprise sector reforms have&#13;
been part of many Bank and IDA projects, and the experience has generally been encouraging. So has been&#13;
the experience with information technology investments in payment systems and bank automation. The&#13;
proposed Project has benefitted from this experience in its preparation, and will continue to do so in&#13;
supervision. Some Project components stand out as less common:&#13;
(i) The experience of the Bank with study tours has been mixed, with the main risk being the selection of&#13;
inappropriate tour participants and insufficient rigor in tour programs. The study tour program for&#13;
enterprise managers proposed under this Project would attempt to minimize these risks. The selection&#13;
of participants would follow pre-determined weighted criteria, be carried out with the involvement of&#13;
external consultants and trainers, and be supervised by a Steering Committee. The study tours would&#13;
be rigorously structured, with each tour member responsible for analyzing particular issues,&#13;
contributing to the tour team's technical reports, and participating in post-tour dissemination activities.&#13;
In many ways, the tour program is built on the basis of the highly positive experience of the vast study&#13;
tour program under the Marshall Plan after World War 11.&#13;
(ii) The resolution of bad debt in the banking sector, and the related restructuring or liquidation of debtor&#13;
enterprises, has been the subject of Bank projects in Poland and Slovenia, among others. Recently, the&#13;
Bank approved a Privatization and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit to Kyrgyzstan which, among&#13;
other things, will help establish an institution to liquidate or restructure about thirty insolvent&#13;
enterprises. The preparation of this Project for Kazakhstan has benefitted from reviewing the approach&#13;
and experience of these operations and further similar initiatives in Eastern Europe.&#13;
(iii) Intensive bank-to-bank assistance arrangements, often called 'twinning' if promising local banks thus&#13;
enter into close partnerships with foreign banks, have been funded by the Bank on an extensive scale&#13;
in Poland. So far, the experience in implementation has been encouraging in most of these Polish&#13;
cases. Similar arrangements for thirty to forty banks are the core of the FY 94 Financial Institutions&#13;
Development Project for Russia. In the Ukraine, the Bank is supporting bank-to-bank assistance for&#13;
the Savingsbank.&#13;
(iv) The Bank has started funding the modernization of the national payments systems in transition&#13;
economies like China and Hungary (both Loans effective in FY 93). The latter system, in particular,&#13;
bears many similarities with the system to be installed under this Project. Similar endeavors are being&#13;
prepared for Russia and the Ukraine, and have been requested by the Governments of Uzbekistan and&#13;
Azerbaijan. In Kazakhstan, some interim improvements to the old payments system are being&#13;
implemented under the Bank's Technical Assistance Loan, and have been benefitting from excellent&#13;
cooperation and sound capabilities of NBK.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
2.7           Through its Technical Assistance Loan and sundry other activities, the Bank has learned&#13;
lessons about the implementation of technical assistance executed by the Government of Kazakhstan. This&#13;
experience suggests that (i) multi-component projects be implemented directly by the counterpart agencies&#13;
of the respective components rather than by one central agency, in order to avoid difficulties of&#13;
commnunication, inter-agency coordination, and conflicting priorities; (ii) substantial external implementation&#13;
advice and assistance are indispensable since local Government staff are still largely unfamiliar with&#13;
international legal customs, financial instruments, consultant industry practices, and complex equipment&#13;
procurement; and (iii) project implementation units need a sufficient number of capable local staff; and (iv)&#13;
the Bank needs to provide for intensive supervision.&#13;
III. THE FINANCIAL AND ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives and Concept&#13;
3.1           The Government of Kazakhstan is committed to stabilizing and restructuring the economy.&#13;
These commitments are reflected in the Standby Agreement that has been signed with the International&#13;
Monetary Fund, and the Economic Rehabilitation Loan signed with the World Bank. The success of these&#13;
programs critically depends on fundamental restructuring of the enterprise and financial sectors. This Project&#13;
would build important institutional capacity for such restructuring, and directly support its implementation&#13;
in core areas.&#13;
3.2           In the enterprise sector, the monitorable objectives of the proposed Project would be to:&#13;
(i)    support the rapid and effective implementation of the country's privatization program through&#13;
continued assistance to SPC. The effectiveness of this assistance would be measured by the success&#13;
of SPC in carrying out the program consistent with the objectives spelled out in understandings with&#13;
the IMF and under the Rehabilitation Loan financed by the Bank. This would concern the speed of&#13;
privatization as well as the principles of equitable, transparent, and competitive processes conducive&#13;
for improving enterprise governance;&#13;
(ii)   help major distressed enterprises prepare for their restructuring and privatization, or their liquidation.&#13;
In terms of monitorable results, a quick preliminary viability analysis would be carried out for up&#13;
to forty highly indebted illiquid firms, and about twenty of these firms would formulate, with&#13;
consultant assistance, detailed plans for restructuring and privatization or liquidation. Moreover,&#13;
at least fifty local individuals would upgrade their skills in enterprise turnaround or liquidation by&#13;
working jointly with foreign experts on the advisory teams that help to produce those assessments&#13;
and plans; and&#13;
(iii)   carry out a highly structured study tour program to familiarize enterprise managers with modern&#13;
business and management practices. About 160 managers would spend at least three weeks each&#13;
studying enterprises on-site in market economies. Moreover, approximately 320 managers would&#13;
receive classroom training in business planning and enterprise restructuring; ten sub-sector reports&#13;
reflecting the tour teams' findings would be distributed locally; and a model for effective manager&#13;
study tours would be established for replication in Kazakhstan and other CIS republics.&#13;
3.3           In the financial sector, the objectives of the proposed Project would be to:&#13;
(i)    create a Rehabilitation Trust that would provide an institutional framework for taking the most highly&#13;
indebted loss-making enterprises off the balance sheets of the commercial banks and forcing their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
restructuring and privatization, or else their liquidation. Up to forty major insolvent enterprises&#13;
would be allocated to this institution, and after four years each of them would either have been&#13;
liquidated or it would have carried out major "passive" restructuring, vastly improved its cash flow,&#13;
and initiated or completed its privatization. This would be achieved in a manner that is financially&#13;
supportable by the banks and the state, and does not create major adverse expectations of general&#13;
bail-out of banks or enterprises;&#13;
(ii)   comprehensively develop or restructure four commercial banks through intensive longer-term&#13;
assistance by foreign banks and through the enhancement of their information technology. At the&#13;
end of the assistance period, the two new banks among the four banks would meet international&#13;
standards institutionally and financially. The two formerly specialized banks would have carried out&#13;
comprehensive operational restructuring relieving them of non-viable operations and enabling them&#13;
to conduct their core operations efficiently and in a way that enhances sound competition in the&#13;
banking sector;&#13;
(iii)   deepen NBK's capacity for the on-site supervision of commercial banks, in continuation of similar&#13;
assistance started earlier under the Bank's Technical Assistance Loan. At the end of the two-phase&#13;
assistance program, NBK would have about forty trained and experienced bank examiners, including&#13;
ten specially qualified examination team leaders, and would have conducted at least twenty partial&#13;
and twenty full examinations of banks with consultant assistance; and&#13;
(iv)   build the infrastructure of a national payment system for the longer term. The system would&#13;
accelerate domestic payments in an orderly way, enhance banks' liquidity management, and permit&#13;
the use of a range of payment instruments. The system would accomplish, starting in 1997, same-&#13;
day finality of settlements and real-time processing of high-value transactions. Moreover, general&#13;
commercial banking software would have been provided to at least ten commercial banks, facilitating&#13;
their interface with the payment system.&#13;
3.4           Several components would directly follow up on the Bank's Technical Assistance Loan by&#13;
implementing the results of its diagnostic and feasibility studies, and by deepening its institution-building&#13;
efforts. The Loan would supplement grant funding that will be provided by other donors for some of the&#13;
reform measures but that is expected to warrant additional funding to bring about the necessary results.&#13;
Accordingly, the Project components are closely coordinated with other donor agencies, and some&#13;
components would be parallel financed or co-financed by such other sources.&#13;
B. Project Components&#13;
3.5           The proposed Project would include the provision of institutional infrastructure, technical&#13;
assistance, and training for enterprise sector reform (US$18.4 million) and financial sector reform (US$47.7&#13;
million), as well as for project implementation (US$1.6 million). Of the total estimated project cost of&#13;
US$72.9 million, the Loan would finance about 85%, with the remainder funded by other donors, the&#13;
Government, and beneficiary banks and enterprises. Details of the Project components are presented in&#13;
Annexes II - IV.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
1. Enterprise Sector Reform&#13;
a. Privatization Assistance Phase II&#13;
(US$5.2 million, of which IBRD US$5.0 million)&#13;
3.6           The Project would continue the World Bank's support to SPC  in carrying out its&#13;
comprehensive privatization program. To the extent needed in view of the progress achieved in phase I, the&#13;
Project would extend the current assistance for mass privatization, starting in the fourth quarter of 1995,&#13;
albeit based on a new consultant contract. Issues requiring foreign specialists would likely include, inter&#13;
alia, questions of segmentation and clarification of enviromnental liabilities in the course of preparing firms&#13;
for sale; training of investment fund staff in corporate governance, restructuring, and capital market&#13;
participation; ad hoc advice ('trouble shooting') to SPC's leadership; continuous adjustments of procedures&#13;
to rapidly changing circumstances; and the "repackaging", through segmentation, spin-off of social assets,&#13;
or restructuring of liabilities, of firms whose shares had been rejected in earlier auctions.&#13;
3.7           Potentially, this Project component could also support the so-called case-by-case privatization&#13;
under Kazakhstan's privatization program, depending on the assistance that other donors would provide and&#13;
on the capacity of SPC to handle a large number of consultant contracts. Case-by-case privatization applies&#13;
to firms that are very large (more than 5,000 employees) or special (in the sense of requiring a sound&#13;
regulatory framework before privatization or complex contractual provisions upon privatization, for examnple,&#13;
natural monopolies, exploiters of non-renewable natural resources, and public service firms). The funding&#13;
of fixed fees demanded by advisors for the preparation and sale of such objects, particularly where the&#13;
clhances of successful company sale do not appear certain, has emerged as a critical constraint. Where such&#13;
funding has not been available, SPC has started accepting consultant proposals for direct non-competitive&#13;
sale to investors if these were the only consultant proposals not involving fixed fees.  To support&#13;
implementation of the case-by-case privatization program without suffering the drawbacks of non-competitive&#13;
divestiture, the Government could use Loan funds to help cover fixed advisor fees. However, this would&#13;
only be done if it were part of a joint financial effort of the donor community and the Government, and if&#13;
SPC established adequate capacity to execute such an assistance program. The Bank has meanwhile&#13;
mobilized Japanese trust funds which allow SPC to engage a team of financial advisors to support the overall&#13;
management of its case-by-case privatization program. The total funding under the Loan available for the&#13;
Privatization Assistance Phase 11 would amount to US$5.0 million.&#13;
b. Restructuring Advisory Unit (including Environmental Sub-Component)&#13;
(US$10.9 million, of which IBRD US$10.0 million)&#13;
3.8           Distressed enterprises are placing an enormous burden on their banks, suppliers, the state&#13;
budget, and other creditors, and require urgent restructuring. The enterprises are short, however, of in-&#13;
house expertise or local expert advice for the assessment of their viability and the development of market-&#13;
oriented restructuring programs. There is a similar shortage of local capacity for preparing and carrying&#13;
out liquidations. These deficiency have particular economic consequences in the case of those firms that&#13;
have the largest arrears towards various categories of creditors. The debts of these up to forty most heavily&#13;
indebted insolvent firms would be transferred to the earlier mentioned Rehabilitation Trust, which would&#13;
make any further financing to these enterprises conditional on the their submitting proper assessments of their&#13;
viability, and satisfactory restructuring plans or liquidation proposals. The size and complexity of the&#13;
enterprises, however, require particular skills, experience, and international market knowledge for such&#13;
analysis and planning.&#13;
3.9           The Government is therefore establishing a special Restructuring Advisory Unit (RAU) to&#13;
help enterprises, upon their request, undertake viability assessments and prepare restructuring and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
privatization plans, or liquidation proposals. This unit would focus its work first with priority on the firms&#13;
submitted to the Rehabilitation Trust. Over time, it could dedicate an increasing portion of its capacity to&#13;
consulting private enterprises on their restructuring. The Restructuring Advisory Unit is being established&#13;
as an independent unit attached to the Ministry of Economy, with autonomous status and its own budget.&#13;
Its head would be appointed, and subject to dismissal, by Government decision.&#13;
3.10          The Restructuring Advisory Unit would have a small core staff. For each enterprise, or&#13;
group of enterprises, it would employ external or local consultants for most of the analysis and planning.&#13;
The Restructuring Advisory Unit could also invite, for an enterprise or group of enterprises, technical&#13;
experts of the Ministry or Economy and other agencies and territorial authorities to join ad hoc working&#13;
groups under the Unit's leadership to lend support to, but not to instruct, the Unit's enterprise-specific&#13;
project team. The nature of the Unit's work would be that of an advisory service to the enterprise. The&#13;
restructuring plan or liquidation proposal elaborated with the Unit's help would be submitted by the&#13;
enterprise management to the Rehabilitation Trust, which would then approve or disapprove the plan and&#13;
accordingly decide on further financial support subject to implementation of the plan. In other words, the&#13;
Rehabilitation Trust in its role as dominant creditor would require enterprises to restructure, whereas the&#13;
Restructuring Advisory Unit would advise these enterprises in actually elaborating the restructuring plans&#13;
for submission to the Rehabilitation Trust's approval and financial support. Environmental considerations&#13;
would be brought into the viability assessments and restructuring plans, with a view to identifying&#13;
opportunities for efficiency enhancements that reduce pollution simultaneously, and to facilitating eventual&#13;
privatization through early environmental audits. The key organizational and operating principles of the&#13;
Restructuring Advisory Unit, based on the concept note shown in Annex II. 1, have been agreed upon during&#13;
Loan Negotiations.&#13;
3.11          The Project would support the institution-building and operation of the Restructuring&#13;
Advisory Unit through a core team of three full-time and two part-time consultants for a period of up to&#13;
three years, thus totalling about nine person-years. One of the full-time advisors would be an environmental&#13;
specialist, and one of the part-time advisors a legal expert; the other three persons would be business&#13;
consultants with substantial restructuring experience. This core team would initially be supplemented by&#13;
additional experts to help rapidly undertake a rough review ("quick-scan") of the viability of all the firms&#13;
submitted to the Rehabilitation Trust. For the subsequent elaboration of restructuring plans or liquidation&#13;
proposals of individual enterprises, or possibly for several enterprises in the same sub-sector, the&#13;
Restructuring Advisory Unit would engage teams of short-term experts to work with the individual project&#13;
teams.  The use of local experts as consultant team members or subcontractors would be strongly&#13;
encouraged, with a view to building a local private consultant industry. The terms of reference for the short-&#13;
term teams would be written, their performance monitored, and their outputs reviewed by the Restructuring&#13;
Advisory Unit with help by the core team. Assuming that the advisors would work almost exclusively on&#13;
enterprises under control of the Rehabilitation Trust, and assuming a certain mix of enterprise size, viability,&#13;
and sub-sectors, it is estimated that about 20 - 25 firms would be assisted by the short-term teams. Other&#13;
donors are already providing restructuring advice to some enterprises, and further donors are expected to&#13;
provide additional assistance, especially once the Unit is established and working effectively. The total&#13;
funding provided to the Restructuring Advisory Unit under the Loan would amount to US$10.0 million.&#13;
c. Study Tour Program for Enterprise Managers&#13;
(US$2.3 million, of which IBRD US$1.8 million)&#13;
3.12          In Kazakhstan today, modern management and marketing capabilities needed in a competitive&#13;
market economy are still scarce. Study tours of enterprise managers from an economic sub-sector, if very&#13;
rigorously organized and accompanied with pre- and post-tour training activities, have proven to be highly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
effective tools for transferring modern management know-how in a short time. They open eyes, and have&#13;
the managers see for themselves what works, and how.&#13;
3.13          Two pilot tours have taken groups of managers from Kazakhstan to the United States and&#13;
the Far East in June 1994, supported by a grant from the Institutional Development Fund (IDF). These pilot&#13;
activities helped build local experience and capacity to implement such a tour program, and provided&#13;
valuable insights for strengthening the program. This Loan would fund ten further tours between July 1995&#13;
and April 1996. It is expected that other donors continue and further expand the program thereafter.&#13;
3.14          The tour program would consist of a set of inter-related activities: (i) pre-tour seminars of&#13;
7 - 10 days; (ii) highly structured study tours of 3 - 5 weeks for 16 enterprise managers per tour, to visit&#13;
10 - 12 enterprises in a sub-sector, and relevant support institutions, in one or several countries; and (iii)&#13;
post-tour activities like seminars, dissemination of tour teams' reports, follow-up assistance, and tour impact&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
3.15          The selection of participants would aim at identifying managers of medium and large&#13;
enterprises, and some rapidly growing new enterprises, that have proven capabilities and decision-making&#13;
authority to introduce important changes in their enterprises. Firms would generally send two participants.&#13;
The selection process would consist of two stages. First, enterprises would be selected for the pre-tour&#13;
seminars according to objective criteria relating to the firms, resumes of proposed individuals, their job&#13;
descriptions, and other application materials, as well as according to their willingness to pay fees that cover&#13;
most or all of the local costs of conducting the seminars. Second, from among the seminar participants,&#13;
about half of the teams would be chosen to participate in the study tours, according to their capabilities and&#13;
motivation demonstrated during the seminars. The actual evaluations would be carried out by the external&#13;
consultants/trainers, employed by the Ministry of Economy with funding from this Loan, in collaboration&#13;
with the local training institutions involved in the program. Agreement in principle has been reached upon&#13;
Loan Negotiations about the main organizational and operational features of the program as described in the&#13;
concept note shown in Annex 11.2, and in particular on the criteria, mechanisms, and responsibilities for&#13;
selecting seminar and tour participants. The participant selection criteria would be formally approved, and&#13;
the subsector selection criteria completed, by the Tour Program Steering Committee in agreement with the&#13;
participating training institution, the host country partner institution, and the Bank.&#13;
3.16          The program would be overseen by a Steering Committee comprised of representatives of&#13;
government agencies and business associations, and some participants of the two pilot tours of June 1994.&#13;
A tour program unit under the Ministry of Economy's Personnel Training Department is acting as secretariat&#13;
to the Steering Committee, and will be responsible for coordination, logistical arrangements, procurement&#13;
of consultants and trainers, and ensuring organization of post-tour activities. The Ministry of Economy had&#13;
already carried out the two above-mentioned pilot tours in mid-1994. A local training institution, most likely&#13;
the State Academy of Management, would organize and carry out the seminars, and in this context play a&#13;
key role in the selection of seminar and tour participants. External trainers/consultants would teach at the&#13;
seminars, assist with the selection of participants, and accompany the tours. One or several foreign host&#13;
country institutions would help arrange the company visits and logistics, and provide experts to also&#13;
accompany the tours and conduct post-tour activities in Kazakhstan.  The World Bank's Economic&#13;
Development Institute (EDI) would provide training materials and guidance to the seminars.&#13;
3.17          The costs of the ten tours with their related activities are estimated at US$2.3 million, of&#13;
which this Loan would fund US$1.8 million, the host country institution some US$200,000, and the&#13;
participating enterprises some US$1,500 - 2,000 equivalent each in local currency. For further details on&#13;
the tour program see Annex II.2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. Financial Sector Reforn&#13;
a. Debt Resolution Institution (Rehabilitation Trust)&#13;
(US$2.5 million, of which IBRD US$2.4 million)&#13;
3.18           As the economy's monetary constraints are being hardened and inflation is being reigned in,&#13;
the banks and the state budget are increasingly suffering from  arrears on claims on enterprises.  The&#13;
commercial banks are still too weak in governance and capabilities to deal with all their large distressed&#13;
borrowers. To contain the burden created by up to forty enterprises with very high arrears, and to force&#13;
their restructuring and privatization if they are viable, or their liquidation if they are non-viable, a temporary&#13;
debt resolution institution called Rehabilitation Trust is being established.&#13;
3.19           The enterprises are being selected mainly according to their total non-performing net debt4,&#13;
which consists mainly of arrears to suppliers and to the tax and social security authorities, non-performing&#13;
bank loans, and debt that resulted from the inter-enterprise arrears clearing exercise in early 1994. The&#13;
Government is completing the compilation of this data. Agricultural firms, whose non-performing debts&#13;
would be treated separately, would not be included. Public service firms such as utilities would not be&#13;
included either because their financial problems stem largely from state pricing policies rather than operating&#13;
inefficiencies, and because liquidation would not be a realistic option. Due to the objective and nature of&#13;
the Rehabilitation Trust, enterprise are expected to try to avoid allocation to the bank. The enterprises are&#13;
therefore being selected by the Government, following the above criteria, instead of applying on their own.&#13;
3.20           The outstanding bank debts of the enterprises, and some of their arrears to the Government,&#13;
would be transferred to the Rehabilitation Trust, together with their refinancing by central credit resources&#13;
and the bank deposits of the enterprises. To force restructuring and privatization, or liquidation, the&#13;
Rehabilitation Trust will cut a firm off from any inflow of new funds except through the Rehabilitation Trust&#13;
itself. The Rehabilitation Trust would make any provision of funds to a firm, or relief from debt,&#13;
conditional on agreement on a rigorous restructuring plan and its timely implementation. The plans would&#13;
focus on "passive" restructuring, i.e., turnaround without major new investment; new investments would&#13;
instead be funded by commercial banks or private investors after the passive restructuring and privatization.&#13;
Restructuring would need to be completed within three years, and liquidation within a shorter time. The&#13;
Trust itself will exist for only about four years, as stipulated in a termination clause in its constituent&#13;
documents.&#13;
3.21           To the extent possible, the creditor and owner roles would be kept separated, and the&#13;
creditor's role is expected to prevail over the owner's role given the insolvency and illiquidity of the debtor&#13;
enterprises. The process would be as follows: (i) The Rehabilitation Trust would request a viability&#13;
assessment and comprehensive restructuring plan from an enterprise assigned to it. (ii) The enterprise would&#13;
undertake this analysis and write its plan. To do this, it would have access to expert advice from the&#13;
consultant-assisted Restructuring Advisory Unit described earlier (Section II.B. 1 .b). (iii) The Rehabilitation&#13;
Trust alone would then decide on whether the plan would likely succeed in making the enterprise&#13;
economically and financially viable, and whether the costs of the restructuring are warranted and remain&#13;
within the financial envelope available to the Rehabilitation Trust. (iv) The Rehabilitation Trust would&#13;
closely supervise the firm to minimize further losses, prevent asset dissipation, preclude further arrears to&#13;
third parties, and monitor the implementation of the plan. The Rehabilitation Trust's satisfaction with the&#13;
4/ Since until mid-1994 inflation was still very high and real interest rates negative, much of the non-performing&#13;
outstanding debt consists of debt newly accumulated in 1993-94. In many cases, it served to finance a negative operating&#13;
cash flow of the enterprise. Losses recorded by the enterprises in the existing, old accounting system are not very&#13;
meaningful indicators of enterprises' financial performance, especially in the inflationary environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
implementation progress would be condition for its on-going financial support. If the firm has no prospect&#13;
for viability, or if no satisfactory restructuring plan is submitted, or if the implementation progress is&#13;
unsatisfactory, the Rehabilitation Trust will trigger liquidation procedures for the firm (or, in the case of&#13;
minor non-compliance with its demands, replace the management).&#13;
3.22           It is essential that this debt resolution institution be able to exercise total control over all&#13;
financial transactions of a firm. They would transit through one single account, and would be a priori&#13;
controlled and authorized by a loan officer of the Rehabilitation Trust. This is easiest to achieve if the&#13;
institution is established in the form of a bank rather than a fund. The establishment and operation, as well&#13;
as the future termination, of the Rehabilitation Trust would be facilitated if it used premises, information&#13;
systems, and technical facilities of an existing bank (e.g., Turanbank) under a fee-based contractual&#13;
arrangement.&#13;
3.23           It is envisaged that the Rehabilitation Trust be a fully state-owned joint stock bank with&#13;
special status. Due to the state's role as creditor of many enterprises, the Ministry of Finance has taken a&#13;
,ea d     role in establishing the Trust. The Supervisory Board of the Rehabilitation Trust will be chaired by an&#13;
official of at least Deputy Prime Minister rank, and include representatives of the Ministries of Finance and&#13;
Economy, SPC. NBK, and other entities. In addition to the functions normally exercised by the supervisory&#13;
board of a joint stock bank, the Supervisory Board of the Rehabilitation Trust would need to approve every&#13;
restructuring or liquidation plan, and decide on the volume of financial support to the enterprises. The&#13;
equity capital of the Rehabilitation Trust will be funded from the Budget, and its annual operating losses&#13;
from the Budget, Government-guaranteed NBK credit, and/or Government-guaranteed bonds. A concept&#13;
note on the Rehabilitation Trust is attached as Annex 111.1(a).&#13;
3.24           The key operating principles of the Rehabilitation Trust, based on the concept note shown&#13;
in Annex 111.1(a), as well as the criteria for selecting enterprises to be subordinated to the Rehabilitation&#13;
Trust, have been agreed upon during Loan Negotiations. The adoption of the founding Presidential Decree&#13;
and a satisfactory draft charter of the Rehabilitation Trust were conditions for Board presentation. So were&#13;
be satisfactory provisions in the national budget for the Rehabilitation Trust's first year of operation.&#13;
Disbursement under this Loan component would be contingent on the establishment of the Trust in a manner&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, which would include, in addition to the Presidential Decree and a Government&#13;
Resolution, the registration of the Trust's charter and the issuance of appropriate banking licenses by NBK.&#13;
Disbursement under this Loan component would further be contingent on the existence of legal and&#13;
regulatory provisions, satisfactory to the Bank, governing out-of-court settlement of debt claims and&#13;
necessary for the successful functioning of the Rehabilitation Trust, such as appropriate legal provisions for&#13;
foreclosure and debt transfer. (Agreements reached, conditions met, and conditions to be met for&#13;
disbursements are shown in Section IV.)&#13;
3.25           It is planned that the Rehabilitation Trust be fully operational by June 1995. The World&#13;
Bank is currently providing, through its Technical Assistance Loan, a short-term advisor team to help&#13;
elaborate in further detail the organizational structure, operating procedures, staff needs, training plan,&#13;
company documents, and so forth. The Finance and Enterprises Development Loan would subsequently fund&#13;
a small core team of senior external advisors for more than two years, starting in about June 1995, and some&#13;
short-term advisors as would be needed to resolve special problems. This advisor team would train local&#13;
staff, provide policy and legal advice, and supplement local capacity where special expertise is needed in&#13;
financial analysis, financial control, liquidations, and other fields. Draft summary terms of reference for&#13;
the consultants are shown in Annex III. l(b). This Loan component would amount to US$2.4 million.&#13;

3.26          This component would help strengthen commercial banking activities of local banks. It&#13;
would focus on (i) the development of a core of new but rapidly growing private banks that aim at reaching,&#13;
in a few years, commonly accepted international standards of bank management, services and financial&#13;
condition, and (ii) the restructuring and consolidation of large banks that are expected to undergo major&#13;
restructuring and continue playing an important role in the provision of banking services in Kazakhstan. It&#13;
will principally rely on the implementation of "twinning" arrangements with reputable foreign banks, a&#13;
scheme already tested in other countries and considered one of the most efficient and cost-effective way to&#13;
provide comprehensive assistance to banks in transition economies. This component would support the&#13;
implementation of institutional as well as technological development programs of the participating banks.&#13;
The Loan would help fund the development programs of two medium-size private and two large banks. The&#13;
European Bank (EBRD) envisages supporting similar programs of two further medium-size banks and two&#13;
further large banks, most likely Turanbank and Kredsocbank. Together with wholly or partly foreign owned&#13;
banks in Kazakhstan like those of ABN Amro/IFC and Chase Manhattan, and further locally owned banks&#13;
that might be encouraged by the example of twinning arrangements to seek closer cooperation with foreign&#13;
banks, these banks are expected to meet international standards soon, and to constitute the core of&#13;
Kazakhstan's future banking system.&#13;
3.27          The two large banks tentatively pre-selected for restructuring support under this Loan are&#13;
Agroprombank and the People's Bank. Both suffer from severe institutional weaknesses and, in the case of&#13;
Agroprombank, a particularly poor financial condition, and need to undergo intensive restructuring.&#13;
Agroprombank, which is mainly owned by the Government and state enterprises, is specialized in the&#13;
financing of the agricultural and agro-processing sectors. The bank with its 235 branches employs more than&#13;
5,600 employees, and has until recently accounted for almost one third of total assets in the commercial&#13;
banking sector. More than other large banks, it has been relying on central credit resources to finance its&#13;
lending, which to large extent is directed credit. The bank's loan collection rates and profitability have been&#13;
very weak, reflecting in part the financial distress in the agricultural sector in 1993-94, prior to the removal&#13;
of important price controls, the phase-out of most "state needs", and the introduction of domestic competition&#13;
in grain marketing. Liberalization in agriculture, and the provision of directed credit henceforth only with&#13;
explicit Government guarantees, will improve the operating environment of the bank.  Moreover, the&#13;
Government has recently established a special fund that is assuming most of Agroprombank's non-performing&#13;
loans accumulated in the past. Agroprombank has recently been subject to an in-depth diagnostic and&#13;
strategic study under the Bank's Technical Assistance Loan, laying the basis for a comprehensive&#13;
restructuring plan. One option, for example, is to spin part of the bank's branch network off to become&#13;
rural credit cooperatives, with the remaining bank operating as a general commercial bank with a certain&#13;
focus on large-scale agro-business clients.  If satisfactory, the bank's restructuring plan would be&#13;
implemented with the assistance of a foreign bank or consultants under this Project.&#13;
3.28         The People's Bank is the former Savingsbank that has recently been transformed into a&#13;
common joint-stock universal bank. The bank's vast network of 4,060 branches and counters is being cut&#13;
back through the termination of leases on many premises. Overall, the Savingsbank deposit base had shrunk&#13;
drastically in real terms in the last years when it offered highly negative real interest rates and fell behind&#13;
the newer banks and non-bank collectors of household savings in upgrading its service quality and variety.&#13;
Since its transformation, the bank no longer needs to pass on its deposits to the state; is free in setting its&#13;
interest rates; is engaged in a wider variety of consumer financial services; and is supposed to be relieved&#13;
from, or compensated for, services provided on Government request. In return, it is envisaged that the bank&#13;
no longer enjoy a state guarantee for its deposits. An in-depth diagnostic and strategic study has been&#13;
undertaken under the Technical Assistance Loan for this bank as well. It would result in a restructuring plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
that a foreign bank would help implement. The restructuring program would also facilitate the further&#13;
privatization of the bank in an orderly manner. Like Agroprombank, the People's Bank would only be&#13;
eligible to the program if it presents a restructuring plan that is satisfactory to the World Bank and is agreed&#13;
on by the Government and NBK.&#13;
3.29          The two private, medium-sized banks are being selected through a three-step process. (i)&#13;
Potential candidates are pre-selected based on a series of quantitative criteria (the diversification of their&#13;
shareholding, the level of their equity base, their solvency and liquidity situation, their effort to mobilize&#13;
deposit resources and the level of their dependence on NBK refinancing facilities, their ownership, and their&#13;
focus on private sector clients), and on their desire to rapidly develop close links with reputable foreign&#13;
banks (but their difficulty to achieve this goal on their own). On this basis, four banks have been tentatively&#13;
pre-selected. (ii) The pre-selected banks have been subject to comprehensive financial and institutional&#13;
diagnostic studies by international audit firms in late 1994, aimed at confirming that they effectively meet&#13;
the selection criteria and at designing the main components of their required institutional development and&#13;
automation programs. (iii) Finally, the banks will have to commit themselves, under Subsidiary Financing&#13;
Agreements, to pursue sound and prudent banking practices and to strive and meet generally accepted&#13;
international financial standards in three years time. The principles of the eligibility criteria for local&#13;
commercial banks to participate in the program under the Project have been agreed upon during Loan&#13;
Negotiations.&#13;
3.30          A number of foreign banks have already expressed an interest in "twinning" arrangements&#13;
with Kazakh banks. Initial contacts will be organized when the diagnostic studies will be available in final&#13;
form. The selection of these foreign banks would be made according to the usual World Bank procedures&#13;
for the use of consultants.&#13;
3.31          Each institutional strengthening program would be tailored to the needs of the individual&#13;
bank. It would be based on its absorption capacity, its present situation, and its development strategy&#13;
established with the help of the in-depth studies. Such a program would typically consist of the elaboration&#13;
of a detailed and time-bound business plan; a rationalization of the bank's organization and procedures; and&#13;
the upgrading of key banking functions and skills in the areas of organization and procedures, credit policy&#13;
and management, marketing, risk assessment and financial management, planning and budgeting systems,&#13;
internal control, information and performance measurement systems, personnel and training policy, and&#13;
technology policy and automation planning. The main aim would be to rapidly become an international&#13;
standards bank.&#13;
3.32          The technological development program of each bank would be based on the automation&#13;
component of the bank's strategic plan, and would be closely integrated into its institutional strengthening&#13;
program. As a consequence, these automation programs would usually start six to twelve months after the&#13;
start of the institutional strengthening. The design of the automation programs would also depend on: (i)&#13;
the technical features of the future payment system; (ii) the potential emergence of computer service bureaus;&#13;
and (iii) the budget constraint of each bank. A typical program would include financing for information&#13;
technology experts to write specifications, the provision of computer and communication hardware and&#13;
software, and training.&#13;
3.33         The total cost of this Component is currently estimated at US$17 million, of which the World&#13;
Bank Loan would fund US$12 million. Co-financing sources would provide US$4 million on a grant basis,&#13;
and the banks themselves (for additional automation needs) would cover about US$1 million equivalent. The&#13;
external financing of each bank's institutional development sub-component is expected to come in half from&#13;
the Bank Loan and in half from grants by other donor agencies, whereas the external funding of the&#13;
automation sub-component would be fully provided by the Bank Loan. As a result, each subloan to selected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
banks would be limited to US$3 million or (with the exception of Agroprombank) to the level of each bank's&#13;
equity base, whichever is the lower of the two. As mentioned earlier, the EBRD intends to support in&#13;
parallel the institutional development of four additional banks following the same concept outlined above.&#13;
The conditions for the participation of banks, and draft terms of reference for foreign banks, are presented&#13;
in Annex III.2.&#13;
c. Training for On-Site Bank Supervision, Phase II&#13;
(US$1.3 million, of which IBRD US$1.0 million)&#13;
3.34         This component aims at deepening the training provided to NBK's Bank Supervision&#13;
Department for the development of its on-site examination activities. The first phase of this program is&#13;
financed under the on-going Technical Assistance Loan. At the end of this two-phase program, the Bank&#13;
Supervision Department would have forty qualified and experienced bank examiners, including ten highly&#13;
trained examination team leaders, and would have conducted 24 partial and 24 full examinations of&#13;
commercial banks. This program has been designed and is being implemented in coordination with the IMF&#13;
and USAID, which would provide assistance on supervision regulations, bank licensing, and off-site&#13;
supervision. Particularly close collaboration under this Project is envisaged with USAID and EU funded&#13;
program for classroom teaching of new supervision staff, which would prepare them for the on-the-job&#13;
training in actual examinations under guidance of the trainers funded by this Loan.&#13;
3.35         The Word Bank support focuses on the on-the-job training of bank examiners. Activities&#13;
undertaken in the second phase, supported by this Project, would comprise: (i) the enhancement of staff skills&#13;
and experience in the full-scope examination of banks' financial situation, risk and credit management, and&#13;
internal control procedures; (ii) the implementation of effective intervention mechanisms for problem banks;&#13;
and (iii) the further development of follow-up procedures and examination manual and guidelines. These&#13;
activities would be undertaken with the assistance of two highly qualified long-term advisors for a period&#13;
of two years starting in early 1996. The Loan component would amount to US$1.0 million. USAID is&#13;
expected to fund classroom training, which would supplement the Bank's assistance, with a total of about&#13;
US$200,000. The draft terms of reference for the two long-term advisors constitute Annex 111.3.&#13;
d. Long-Term Payments System&#13;
(US$26.9 million, of which IBRD US$23.8 million)&#13;
3.36         An effective payment system is important for channeling credit transfers to producers and&#13;
consumers of goods and services, improving the availability of working capital to enterprises to meet their&#13;
trade obligations, facilitating foreign investments, expediting the circulation of money between economic&#13;
players, regulating the financial conduct and viability of the participants, facilitating proper oversight of&#13;
credit and liquidity risks in financial sector operations, reducing the float in the system, improving liquidity&#13;
management, and protecting the rights of financial intermediaries and customers. This proposed Project&#13;
component would support these objectives through the establishment of a long-term payment system.&#13;
3.37         Kazakhstan's payment system suffers currently from: (i) severe deficiencies in its rules and&#13;
procedures; (ii) the obsolete equipment and software that operates the existent payment system; and (iii) the&#13;
poor overall system architecture, which is suitable neither for sound, market-oriented banking nor for fast&#13;
and secure transactions that rapidly grow in number. The National Bank is therefore working on all these&#13;
three issues in parallel: (i) The improvement of the rules and procedures has been discussed since 1992 with&#13;
support by the IMF and Bank of Japan. (ii) Some hardware and software for short-term improvements in&#13;
the security and efficiency of the current payment system, and in the ability to apply some new payment&#13;
system rules, is being installed also under that Technical Assistance Loan. (iii) A new payment system for&#13;
the long term would be established under this Finance and Enterprises Development Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
3.38          Some of the key objectives of the long-term system would be to: (i) perform finality of&#13;
settlements on a daily basis, and consolidation of cash in vault, reserve accounts, and settlement balances;&#13;
(ii) accept both gross and netted values (the latter after prior bilateral or multi-lateral clearing among banks);&#13;
(iii) provide a "real time" system for high value transactions; and (iv) accommodate a wide range of payment&#13;
instruments.  The system  would maintain one settlement account per institution.  Private sector&#13;
representatives would be included in the decision-making process to facilitate banks' linking into the system,&#13;
foster cooperation, and encourage private sector initiatives for bi- or multi-lateral clearings between financial&#13;
institutions. A National Payments Council consisting of representatives of NBK, MOF, commercial banks,&#13;
and the Union of Entrepreneurs has been created in January 1995. The National Payments Council is&#13;
starting to play a major role in decisions on matters of payment system strategy, regulations, standards, and&#13;
overall system architecture, among others.&#13;
3.39          The architecture for the long-term system would be centered on three major regional sites&#13;
(South, North/East, and West), reflecting geographical factors. The southern center will be Almaty, and&#13;
the northeastern center probably Akmola, which is envisaged as Kazakhstan's new capital in the longer run.&#13;
All three centers would support clearing functions but only the Almaty center would accomplish settlements&#13;
and maintain the settlement (correspondent) accounts. The three centers would each have duplexed machines&#13;
for back-up, while the Almaty database, which comprises two thirds of the national workload, would be&#13;
replicated in the Northeast region, using an optic fiber cable that is being constructed between Almaty and&#13;
Akmola. In addition to computer equipment, the Project would also finance payment system application&#13;
software, telecommunication links (to ensure that the clearing centers and financial intermediaries are&#13;
networked), training, and initial operation assistance by the contractor. The feasibility and design study for&#13;
the long-term payment system has started in June 1994; the draft final outputs were completed in February&#13;
1995 for discussion by the authorities, the National Payments Council, and the World Bank. Agreement on&#13;
the main features of the long-term payment system has been a condition for Board presentation (see Section&#13;
IV).&#13;
3.40          Also included in this Project component would be a comprehensive customized banking&#13;
application software package to support NBK's central banking functions such as general ledger accounting,&#13;
statistical analysis, foreign exchange, etc. Moreover, NBK would make the same software available to&#13;
commercial banks for mini and micro computer use, under licensing agreement and together with some&#13;
information technology advice and training. Especially small and medium banks could benefit from this offer&#13;
to facilitate their participation in the payment system and to modernize their customer accounting.&#13;
Moreover, the micro computers and communication equipment bought in 1994 for 270 cash centers for the&#13;
interim payment system improvement would further facilitate the commercial banks' interface with the long-&#13;
term payment system.&#13;
3.41          The long-term payment system should be operational by July 1997. The investment costs&#13;
of this Project component are estimated at US$24 million. This includes about US$5 million equivalent for&#13;
the banking application software sub-component (of which about US$2.4 million equivalent are incremental&#13;
costs for making the software also available to a number of commercial banks, not only NBK). The&#13;
investment costs of the payment system network itself, i.e. without this banking application software, are&#13;
expected to total approximately US$19 million equivalent. (For more detail see the concept note in Annex&#13;
111.4; detailed cost estimates are included in the Project File.)&#13;
3. Project Implementation Assistance&#13;
(US$1.6 million, of which IBRD US$1.5 million)&#13;
3.42          To assist project implementation, an experienced consultant firm would provide advice on&#13;
procurement, contract monitoring, disbursement, project reporting, and project coordination. In the first&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
year, the firm would place one full-time procurement advisor with particular information technology&#13;
expertise at NBK; a part-time procurement advisor at SPC; and a third procurement advisor, with special&#13;
expertise in disbursements, for about half of his time on the project at MOE but also assisting NBK and SPC&#13;
in disbursement matters as may be necessary.  In the subsequent one and a half years, implementation&#13;
assistance would continue to be provided but with fewer person-years per year, partly on a short-term basis.&#13;
Draft terms of reference for the consultant firm are shown in Annex IV.&#13;
3.43          The Project would also fund the participation of Project Implementation Units staff in&#13;
procurement and disbursement training abroad, as well as some office equipment for the units. The total&#13;
costs of implementation assistance are estimated at US$1.6 million, of which the Loan would finance US$1.5&#13;
million.&#13;
C. Project Costs and Financing&#13;
3.44          The total project cost is estimated at US$72.9 million equivalent, of which US$64.4 million&#13;
would be in foreign currency. About US$38.6 million of the total cost are costs of equipment, software,&#13;
and related services. For the equipment elements under the payment system component, the estimates are&#13;
preliminary, pending refinement after the last report of the consultant study on the long-term payment system&#13;
will have been received. The various cost elements of consultancy and training have been estimated based&#13;
on the experience with similar activities under the Technical Assistance Loan to Kazakhstan and other&#13;
operations in Eastern and Central Europe. Contingencies of 5 percent (including a 2.3 percent price&#13;
contingency) would be included in each consultant contract and are shown in the cost estimates below as&#13;
integral parts of the cost of the respective Project components.5 The unallocated contingencies are shown&#13;
separately, and refer to all other cost elements, which are mainly goods. These unallocated contingencies&#13;
consist of a 2.3 percent price contingency reflecting projected international inflation, and a 9.7 percent&#13;
physical contingency. Project costs are summarized in Table 1 below, and shown in Annex VI. Detailed&#13;
cost estimates for each Project component have been transmitted to the Borrower and are included in the&#13;
Project File.&#13;
5! Exceptions are consultancy and training that will be part of the equipment contract for the payment system component, and&#13;
short-term consultancies to the Restructuring Advisory Unit. For these costs elements, price and physical contingencies are&#13;
covered by the unallocated contingencies.&#13;

Annex VII. The foreign exchange cost requirements are estimated at US$64,363,000, and local currency&#13;
requirements are estimated at US$8,551,000 equivalent. The World Bank would finance 90.3 percent of&#13;
the foreign exchange costs, and 45.4 percent of the local currency costs. The financing by the Government&#13;
and NBK would increase over time, which would be in line with an expected improvement in the currently&#13;
very tight budget situation.&#13;

Ld    USAID.&#13;
3.46         The Loan would be borrowed by the Republic of Kazakhstan. The Ministry of Finance&#13;
would allocate part of the funds to other Government agencies (SPC and MOE), and on-lend to NBK,&#13;
which is not formally included in the Government. For the commercial bank development component,&#13;
NBK would on-lend to commercial banks under Subsidiary Financing Agreements. The financing by&#13;
donors other than IBRD would be parallel financing; only the grant funding for the commercial bank&#13;
development component would be on a co-financing basis. Local banks and enterprises that benefit&#13;
directly from the bank development component, study tour program, or restructuring advisory services&#13;
would cover substantial parts of the local costs themselves. The financing required from the Government&#13;
would be reflected in appropriate budget provisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
D. The Borrower and Implementation Agencies&#13;
3.47         The Borrower of the Loan would be the Republic of Kazakhstan. There would be four&#13;
counterpart agencies under the Project: National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NBK), State&#13;
Property Committee (SPC), Ministry of Economy (MOE), and Ministry of Finance (MOF). NBK will&#13;
be the counterpart agency for the payment system, commercial bank development, and bank supervision&#13;
components; MOF for the Rehabilitation Trust component; SPC for the privatization assistance; and MOE&#13;
for the study tour program and restructuring advisory components. NBK, SPC, and MOE would also&#13;
implement their respective portions of the implementation assistance components, but the procurement&#13;
and disbursements under this component would be handled by NBK in consultation with SPC and MOE.&#13;
Deputy Chairmen or Deputy Ministers of the four agencies would oversee the individual Project&#13;
components.&#13;
3.48         Three of the four counterpart agencies (NBK, MOE, and SPC) would also be&#13;
implementing agencies. MOF, the fourth counterpart agency, would entrust implementation of its single&#13;
project component, which involves only one consultant contract, to MOE. NBK, SPC, and MOE (at&#13;
present through the National Agency for Foreign Investment, NAFI) already have existing donor relations&#13;
divisions or project implementation units with some initial experience in consultant and equipment&#13;
procurement. To ensure sufficient capacity dedicated to the implementation of this Project, NBK and&#13;
SPC have established Project Implementation Units (PIUs), with at least three staff assigned to NBK's&#13;
unit and two staff to SPC's unit. The establishment of these PIUs at NBK and SPC has been condition&#13;
for Board presentation (see Section IV). Coordination with other external aid and loans provided to the&#13;
Republic of Kazakhstan would be provided by an institution yet to be appointed by the Government, as&#13;
part of that institution's broader aid coordination mandate.  (An overview of the implementation&#13;
arrangements is depicted in Annex V.)&#13;
3.49         In each of their respective areas of responsibility, the NBK, SPC and MOE would be&#13;
responsible for overall implementation and required coordination, within the Government (or with the&#13;
Government, in the case of NBK) as well as with the Bank, procurement agencies, suppliers, and others,&#13;
to ensure a consistent approach in the implementation of their respective Project elements. This would&#13;
include the timely and efficient monitoring and control of the proposed use of Bank funds in the&#13;
procurement of needed goods and services, the administration of a Special Account, the bookkeeping and&#13;
auditing of project accounts, and the preparation of progress and Project Completion Reports on their&#13;
respective activities. In addition, NBK, SPC and MOE would be responsible for: the development of&#13;
terms of reference and short lists; the evaluation of proposals/bids; the management of the bidding&#13;
process; negotiations; obtaining Bank no-objections and other clearances; the signing and execution of&#13;
contracts; the administration of executed contracts; the approval and execution of timely disbursements;&#13;
and audits.&#13;
3.50         For two of the Project's components, the counterpart agencies would act as secretariats&#13;
to broader steering committees. First, the payment system reform, in particular the policy and regulatory&#13;
questions, would be overseen by the National Payments Council. The Council comprises representatives&#13;
from commercial banks, enterprises, and NBK. NBK provides the Chairman of the Council, and its&#13;
Payment System Division acts as secretariat to the Council.  Second, the study tour program for&#13;
managers will be supervised by a Steering Committee comprising industry and Government&#13;
representatives as well as former study tour participants.  It is chaired by a representative of the&#13;
Administration of the Council of Ministers. A special unit within MOE's Personnel Training Department&#13;
acts as the secretariat to this Steering Committee.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
3.51         Various measures aim  at strengthening the still weak local capacity for project&#13;
implementation:&#13;
(i)  NBK would engage, through a competitive selection process in compliance with the World Bank's&#13;
guidelines, the services of a firm with appropriate experience and capability to provide the full&#13;
range of project implementation advisory services to the three PIUs. These services would initially&#13;
be provided for a period of one year. Based on loan implementation requirements, the extension&#13;
of this contract would be subject to the prior review and approval of the NBK and the World Bank,&#13;
in consultation with SPC and MOE. In the first year, the firm (Consultant) would provide three&#13;
experts to assist the three agencies responsible for the implementation of their respective sections&#13;
of the Project, as follows: (i) one procurement advisor, with special expertise in information&#13;
technology procurement, would be assigned to work full-time with NBK's PIU; (ii) a second expert&#13;
would be assigned to work part-time with SPC's PIU; and (iii) a third advisor, with special&#13;
experience in disbursement, would be assigned to work part-time with the PIU at MOE (presently&#13;
located at NAFI) and would, in addition, assist the PIUs at NBK and SPC in disbursement matters&#13;
as will be necessary. A senior member of the consultant team would be the Consultant's team&#13;
leader and would act as the project coordination advisor. The contract with the Consultant would&#13;
also provide for short-term assistance from their headquarters, especially to help finalize the&#13;
specifications of specialized computer and telecommunications items. The tender for the project&#13;
implementation advisors, for the first year of the assistance, would be issued in March 1995, and&#13;
part of the Consultant contract would be funded under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF). Draft&#13;
terms of reference are presented in Annex IV.&#13;
(ii) To strengthen the capabilities of local implementation unit staff, Loan funds would be used for&#13;
short-term training overseas, supplementing training provided on-the-job and through informal&#13;
seminars by the Implementation Consultant.&#13;
(iii) To ensure effective project implementation, the Bank would conduct a project launch mission after&#13;
Loan approval, a mid-term review and a final review, as well as additional interim reviews as&#13;
needed. These reviews would be based on comprehensive Project Progress Reports and a Project&#13;
Completion Report, written by the three implementation agencies (for their respective components)&#13;
with support of the Implementation Consultant. Frequent project supervision at limited costs to the&#13;
Bank would be possible through the simultaneous supervision of related elements of the Technical&#13;
Assistance Loan and preparation of a planned Financial Sector Adjustment Loan. Moreover, the&#13;
participating agencies and the Bank would jointly review the findings of any studies and training&#13;
programs under the Project. (The Supervision Plan in Annex XII provides further detail.)&#13;
3.52          In order to prepare project implementation, engage the above mentioned Implementation&#13;
Consultant, and begin work on a few critical and urgent components, some Project costs could be&#13;
financed under a Project Preparation Facility (PPF). This concerns the Project components regarding the&#13;
Rehabilitation Trust, Restructuring Advisory Unit, manager study tours, and implementation assistance.&#13;
Moreover, there is the option of retroactive financing, as described below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
E. Cost Sharing and On-Lending Arrangements&#13;
3.53          The Loan to the Republic of Kazakhstan would be at standard Bank terms for Kazakhstan&#13;
of a 17-year maturity with a five-year grace period. The Loan would be denominated in the Bank's&#13;
currency pool and bear interest at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.&#13;
3.54          Part of the Loan funds would be on-lent to NBK pursuant to the terms of a Subsidiary&#13;
Loan Agreement between the Government and NBK, which will contain, inter alia, the terms and&#13;
conditions of repayment of the funds on-lent. It is envisaged that the subsidiary loan would have a&#13;
maturity, interest rate, and grace period substantially equivalent to those of the Bank Loan. The on-&#13;
lending terms will need to be approved by the Bank.&#13;
3.55          Under one Project component, the commercial bank development program, Loan funds&#13;
would be on-lent to commercial entities. The on-lending to participating commercial banks would be&#13;
done at the terms and conditions specified in Annex 111.2(b).  These subsidiary loans would be&#13;
denominated in US dollars, and extend over ten years with a four-year grace period. During Loan&#13;
Negotiations, it was agreed that any funds accruing to the NBK as a result of the mismatch of maturities&#13;
would be used either to service the debt on the World Bank Loan or to finance further measures for the&#13;
development of commercial banks. The interest rate would be equivalent to those on 10-year U.S.&#13;
Treasury Notes plus 2 percent, adjusted semi-annually. The banks shall bear a commitment fee at a rate&#13;
equivalent to that paid by the Borrower to the Bank, payable on the undisbursed amount of the Loan and&#13;
beginning to accrue 60 days after the date of the signature of the respective Subsidiary Financing&#13;
Agreement. The cross-currency risk associated with NBK's sub-borrowing the currency pool and on-&#13;
lending in dollars would be covered by NBK. The institutional strengthening sub-component for each&#13;
bank (i.e., not the automation sub-component) would be funded through a combination of grant funds (for&#13;
fifty percent of these cost, up to a maximum US$1.5 million) and proceeds of the proposed Loan.6&#13;
3.56          Participating local commercial banks would be selected according to a set of pre-&#13;
determined criteria concentrated on the size of the banks' capital and asset size, their private ownership,&#13;
their compliance with prudential standards, their commitment to implement agreed institutional and&#13;
automation development plans, their demonstrating acceptable standards of efficiency, accounting, and&#13;
managerial autonomy, and their strong interest in the proposed twinning arrangements. Two large,&#13;
formerly specialized banks would be selected mainly according to their importance to the domestic&#13;
economy, and to their need and willingness to undergo intensive restructuring programs to address their&#13;
weaknesses in organization, procedures, and other aspects. An important basis for the selection would&#13;
be the in-depth diagnostic studies that were undertaken in the ten largest commercial banks in late 1994.&#13;
The final decision would be taken by the respective bank and NBK, subject to approval by the World&#13;
Bank. (See Annex 111.2(b) for detail.)&#13;
3.57          Under several other Project components, commercial banks or enterprises would be&#13;
beneficiaries but not sub-borrowers. Generally, these beneficiary entities would cover a large part of the&#13;
local costs. (i) Banks would pay fees for the use of the future payment system, aimed at covering the&#13;
operating and maintenance costs, and part of the amortization cost.  (ii) Enterprises receiving&#13;
restructuring advice would need to bear part of the local costs. However, these contributions need to be&#13;
6/ The percentage and ceiling of grant financing will be firmed up on the basis of commitments by donors as they are received.&#13;
The Government and participating banks are committed to borrow from the World Bank in case the grants do not materialize.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
modest and constitute mainly an expression of commitment, since the firms would already be in financial&#13;
distress. The firms would provide the respective teams of the Restructuring Advisory Unit free of charge&#13;
with adequate offices, secretarial support, use of communication facilities, and intra-oblast transportation.&#13;
The enterprises would also be charged modest fees, in local currency, for follow-up advisory services&#13;
subsequent to the initial viability assessments and in-depth restructuring studies, i.e., for implementation&#13;
support and follow-up studies. (iii) Enterprises whose managers participate in the study tour program&#13;
and prior seminars would bear the costs of domestic transport and subsistence of their managers during&#13;
pre-tour seminars, pay fees covering part of the local costs of training, and bear the local costs of follow-&#13;
up activities.&#13;
3.58         The principles of the financial arrangements (subloan agreements and cost recovery)&#13;
between state agencies and commercial beneficiaries in the cases of commercial bank development,&#13;
enterprise restructuring advice, manager study tours, and the payments system have been agreed upon&#13;
at Loan Negotiations.&#13;
F. Procurement&#13;
3.59         As briefly outlined below, and as set forth in the Loan Agreement, all goods and&#13;
consulting services for technical assistance to be financed with Bank Loan funds would be procured in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (1981) and on Procurement Under IBRD&#13;
Loans and IDA Credits (1992). A substantial portion of the procurement under this Loan deals with&#13;
consulting assignments, and a larger portion deals with goods, including hardware and software, chiefly&#13;
for the Project's payments system and commercial bank development components. The participation of&#13;
local suppliers of goods and contractors of services is expected to be very limited, since the information&#13;
technology required as well as providers of the needed consultant services are generally not available&#13;
locally; contractors are encouraged, however, to make active use of local employees and subcontractors.&#13;
More details of the main procurement packages and consulting assignments are provided in Annex VIII.&#13;
The procurement capacity of the NBK, SPC and MOE would be strengthened through on-the-job&#13;
assistance provided by the Implementation Consultant mentioned above. Reporting on procurement shall&#13;
be undertaken by the three PIUs with assistance of the Implementation Consultant. Procurement&#13;
information on the progress of packages relating to the schedule and cost shall be provided to the Bank&#13;
through quarterly reports (see para. 3.70), and the Bank shall discuss the progress during the supervision&#13;
missions. Table 3 below provides a summary of proposed procurement arrangements.&#13;

I&amp;  A Project Preparation Facility (PPF) is intended to be used to finance initial consulting activities, training, and minor office equipment.&#13;
3.60              Equipment and Goods. The procurement of equipment and goods concerns principally&#13;
the purchase of information processing and telecommunications equipment and software for the payments&#13;
system and commercial banks development components. (i) All contracts over US$200,000 would be&#13;
awarded through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) following the Bank's Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated May 1992, and using the Bank's Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents. It is expected that six contracts be awarded through ICB. For bid evaluation and&#13;
comparison purposes in ICB procurement, Kazakhstan manufacturers and suppliers may be granted a&#13;
preference margin of fifteen percent or the existing customs duty that a non-exempt importer would have&#13;
to pay, whichever is lower, over the competing price of imports, providing domestic value added is at&#13;
least 20 percent. (ii) Limited International Bidding (LIB) procedures as outlined in Section 3.2 of the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines, and using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents, would be used for an aggregate&#13;
value of not more than US$400,000, where automation improvements, such as banking and local area&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
network (LAN) software, are offered by only a few suppliers and do not justify full advertisement&#13;
procedures. (iii) For the procurement of specialized information technology equipment, e.g., proprietary&#13;
operating systems to expand existing bank networks, and computing and telecommunications hardware&#13;
to continue participating banks' standardization and service/spare parts programs, Direct Contracting (DC)&#13;
can be done. DC is estimated to involve approximately US$0.9 million, and shall not exceed a total&#13;
aggregate value of US$1 million. Such solicitations would be justified and procedures and prices&#13;
reviewed and cleared beforehand as required by the Bank's Guidelines. All DC documentation, awards,&#13;
and contracts would be subject to prior Bank review and clearance. (iv) Goods or group of goods with&#13;
a contract value less than US$200,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate of US$0.8 million, may be&#13;
purchased through International Shopping (IS), by obtaining at least three quotations from suppliers in&#13;
three eligible countries. (v) Goods or group of goods with a total contract value less than US$50,000&#13;
equivalent, up to an aggregate of US$0.1 million may be purchased through Local Shopping (LS), based&#13;
on a minimum of three quotations from three suppliers.&#13;
3.61         To ensure compliance with the World Bank Procurement Guidelines, all contracts awarded&#13;
through ICB, LIB, and DC, as well as the first two contracts under IS, would be subject to prior World&#13;
Bank review and "no-objection". This will result in Bank reviews for approximately eighty-nine percent&#13;
of Bank-financed contracts for goods.  General Procurement Notice will be issued after Loan&#13;
Negotiations.&#13;
3.62   Consultant Services. The selection of consulting firms for the provision of services would be&#13;
carried out following the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency, published by the Bank in August 1981. Contracts will follow the&#13;
Bank's Standard Contract Form for Consultant Services.  Contracts and documentation for the&#13;
employment of consulting firms, estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent each, and contracts&#13;
and documentation for the employment of individual consultants, estimated to cost less than US$50,000&#13;
equivalent each, as well as solicitation methods and terms of reference for all consultant assignments,&#13;
would be subject to the prior Bank review and approval. Other contracts would be subject to the Bank's&#13;
ex-post review including, where appropriate, ex-post review on a selective basis.&#13;
G. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.63         The Loan would finance: (i) up to 100 percent of the foreign expenditures for imported&#13;
goods; (ii) up to 100 percent of the local expenditures (ex-factory costs) for locally manufactured eligible&#13;
goods; (iii) up to 75 percent of the expenditures for other goods procured locally; (iv) up to 100 percent&#13;
of expenditures (- all expenditures to be financed are net of taxes -) of consultant services and training;&#13;
and (v) the PPF. It is projected that US$1.0 million would be disbursed in the Bank's fiscal year (FY)&#13;
1995, in part through retroactive financing for urgent activities launched prior to Loan effectiveness.&#13;
Subsequent disbursements are estimated at US$28.8 million in FY 96, US$24.5 million in FY 97, and&#13;
US$7.6 million in FY 98. The Project is expected to be completed by March 31, 1998, and the Loan&#13;
closing date would be September 30, 1998. (A disbursement schedule is found in Annex IX, and an&#13;
Implementation Plan in Annex X).&#13;
3.64         Withdrawal applications would be fully documented, except for expenditures against&#13;
contracts valued at less than US$10,000 equivalent, which would be made on the basis of certified&#13;
statements of expenditures detailing the individual transactions. The documentation to support these&#13;
expenditures would be retained by NBK, SPC and MOE for their respective Project activities for at least&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
one year, after receipt by the World Bank of the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement&#13;
is made. This documentation would be made available for review by the auditors (see section H below)&#13;
and the World Bank upon request. The minimum amount of application for direct payment and issuance&#13;
of the Special Commitment will be US$50,000.&#13;
3.65         To facilitate and expedite the disbursement of funds, NBK, SPC and MOE would each&#13;
establish a Special Account in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. The authorized allocation to&#13;
the Special Accounts would be US$300,000 for NBK, US$100,000 for SPC, and US$200,000 for MOE,&#13;
representing about four months of average expenditures, respectively, under the Loan. The accounts&#13;
would be opened in the name of the Borrower and would be administered by the respective authorized&#13;
representatives of NBK, SPC and MOE on behalf of the Borrower. At the request of the Borrower, and&#13;
based on the Project needs, the Bank would make an initial deposit or deposits into the Special Accounts&#13;
up to the amount of the respective authorized allocation. NBK, SPC and MOE would send, on a monthly&#13;
basis, to the World Bank requests for replenishment of the Special Accounts for the amounts to be&#13;
transferred. In addition, monthly bank statements of the special accounts which have been reconciled by&#13;
the Borrower should accompany all replenishment requests. The Loan provides for retroactive financing&#13;
up to 10% of the Loan amount in respect of expenditures incurred since June 30, 1994, for goods and&#13;
services procured in accordance with the Bank's practice. Retroactive financing is needed for early&#13;
project start-up and effective implementation.&#13;
3.66         Each Special Account (SA) would be maintained in a commercial bank selected by the&#13;
implementing agencies and acceptable to the World Bank. Selection criteria for participation are: (i) the&#13;
bank should be financially sound as demonstrated by its latest accounts, as audited by an internationally&#13;
recognized accounting firm; (ii) the bank should have a significant foreign correspondence network&#13;
covering all major currencies; (iii) the bank should have a reasonable capacity and experience for issuing&#13;
letters of credit, making direct foreign payments, and other international transactions, with appropriate&#13;
arrangements for the training and development of its staff; (iv) the bank should be capable of performing&#13;
a wide range of local banking services, including cash payments, transfers to other domestic banks,&#13;
issuance of debit notes, application of conversion rates from foreign currencies, and maintenance of&#13;
adequate accounts for the Special Account; (v) the bank should preferably be a member of Swift (Society&#13;
for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) and should routinely use or plan to use this&#13;
facility to expedite payment transfers; (vi) the bank should be willing to issue a Comfort Letter to assure&#13;
that amounts deposited in a Special Account would not be set off or otherwise seized or attached to satisfy&#13;
amounts due to the commercial bank by the Borrower; (vii) the bank should be willing to maintain&#13;
adequate accounts as required by the World Bank, provide monthly bank statements to the World Bank&#13;
and the implementing agencies, and any other information considered necessary; copies of all transactions&#13;
would be routinely submitted to the implementing agencies; and (viii) the bank should be willing to&#13;
charge reasonable rates for its services and provide reasonable interest on balances held from time to&#13;
time. The commercial banks to manage the Special Account must be selected prior to loan effectiveness.&#13;
H. PROJECT ACCOUNTING, FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND AUDITING&#13;
3.67         Accounting. The Borrower would be responsible for the appropriate accounting of the&#13;
funds provided by the Bank under the Loan, for reporting on the use of these funds, and for ensuring that&#13;
audits of the financial statements or reports are submitted to the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
3.68         NBK, SPC and MOE (each on behalf of the Borrower) would establish an appropriate&#13;
accounting system to process and record information on the proper receipt and use of funds provided in&#13;
accordance with the Loan Agreement. The system should ensure timely and accurate accounting of all&#13;
transactions under the Loan and clear presentation of the financial information. NBK, SPC and MOE&#13;
have established capabilities in project accounting and reporting. However, if deemed necessary by these&#13;
agencies, an external disbursement adviser can be procured on a part-time basis to support these agencies&#13;
in order to ensure that all Project accounts are maintained in accordance with internationally accepted&#13;
accounting procedures.&#13;
3.69         The Special Accounts which would be established under the Loan for NBK, SPC and&#13;
MOE are intended to assist the Borrower with cash flow and to enable early and more effective project&#13;
implementation and disbursements. The Borrower would ensure that all the necessary arrangements for&#13;
proper accounting of receipts and payments (and replenishment) are completed before the three Special&#13;
Accounts start operating.&#13;
3.70         Financial Reporting. Financial reporting for the Loan would closely reflect the specific&#13;
requirements of the Loan. It would be comprised of a statement of receipts and payments for the&#13;
reporting period since the beginning of the program. The reporting would be in accordance with the&#13;
disbursements classified and reported by the expenditure categories agreed with the Borrower and spelled&#13;
out in the legal documents. The suggested format of the report has been supplied at Negotiations. Brief&#13;
quarterly progress reports would be submitted by NBK, SPC and MOE on their respective Loan&#13;
component activities. A separate report for the Special Accounts would need to be provided by NBK,&#13;
SPC and MOE, respectively. NBK, SPC and MOE would submit a Project Completion Report to the&#13;
Bank promptly after the completion of their program of activities under the Loan, and, in any event, not&#13;
later than six months after the Loan closing date.&#13;
3.71         Auditing. A condition of the Loan would be that the financial statements and reports on&#13;
the Loan (including the Special Accounts) are audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing&#13;
standards by independent auditors acceptable to the World Bank. The NBK in consultation with SPC and&#13;
MOE would procure an experienced and qualified auditing firm through a competitive selection process&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, and in accordance with the selection criteria indicated below. The auditor would&#13;
perform the audits required by the Bank on NBK, SPC and MOE, and would promptly submit its reports&#13;
to the Bank according to the timetable indicated below.&#13;
3.72         The criteria for selecting auditors would be as follows: (i) impartiality and independence&#13;
from the entity to be audited; (ii) being well established and reputable; (iii) experience in the type of&#13;
assignment to be undertaken; and (iv) ability to fulfill the terms of reference within the specified&#13;
timetable.&#13;
3.73         The audit report is to be submitted to the Bank by the Government within six months of&#13;
the end of the reporting period, i.e., the fiscal year end. The audit would cover a review of the&#13;
supporting documentation made available by NBK, SPC and MOE, including appropriate customs&#13;
documentation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
I. Environmental Assessment&#13;
3.74          Since this Project involves the financing only of computer equipment for the financial&#13;
sector, and of consultancy and training, this is a category "C" Project. The Project would be consistent&#13;
with Bank policy and would follow accepted Bank procedures. In developing procurement procedures&#13;
for financing imports, specific provision would be made to ensure that the inclusion of any toxic or&#13;
hazardous substances would be under conditions acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.75          Kazakhstan's industry is heavily engaged in mining, metallurgy, and primary chemicals&#13;
processing. Some of these facilities are major sources of pollution, as was explained in section I.B.&#13;
above. The critical importance of such large enterprises for entire towns or even oblasts tends to weaken&#13;
pollution control efforts. At present, this problem is exacerbated by the strains of economic adjustment&#13;
on enterprise performance and employment, and the weak accountability of enterprise managers. At the&#13;
same time, concerns about environmental liabilities and uncertainty about future environmental standards&#13;
and regulations are significant barriers to privatization and restructuring. Therefore, consultancy provided&#13;
under this Project to the Restructuring Advisory Unit for the restructuring or liquidation of distressed&#13;
large enterprises would include a sub-component to address environmental issues in this context, as&#13;
mentioned above in section III.B.l.b and further specified in Annex 11.1. The Rehabilitation Trust&#13;
would, as part of its operating procedures, take the environmental issues thus identified into account in&#13;
its decisions on funding of restructuring or liquidation, and in the conditions that it imposes in this context&#13;
on the enterprises.  Moreover, commercial banks would be introduced, under their institutional&#13;
development programs, to environmental due-diligence procedures used in developed market economies.&#13;
3.76          This assistance would complement specific assistance already provided to the Ministry&#13;
of Ecology and Bio-Resources under the Technical Assistance Loan, which supports in particular the&#13;
ministry's legislative, monitoring and enforcement capabilities. Cooperation with other donor agencies&#13;
would be sought by the Bank in the further support to the ministry in matters like the review of&#13;
environmental standards and the strengthening of the management of the Republic's Environmental Fund.&#13;
This latter Fund could play an increasing role in the financing of environmental pollution control, clean-&#13;
up, and damages.&#13;
J. Benefits and Risks&#13;
3.77          Benefits. The Project would support the private sector and Government institutions in&#13;
accelerating and deepening restructuring in the enterprise and financial sectors that is critical for the&#13;
success of the Government's policies of economic stabilization and transformation. First, the Project&#13;
would reinforce enterprise-level adjustment in the real sector. In the process, it would also relieve the&#13;
burden of the most indebted insolvent enterprises on banks and suppliers; set precedents for liquidation&#13;
and for tieing bad debt resolution to rigorous restructuring of enterprises; build local consulting capacity&#13;
for enterprise restructuring; enhance the know-how of local company managers; improve corporate&#13;
governance through privatization; and enable banks to play an important role in enterprise restructuring.&#13;
Second, the Project would enhance the quality and quantity of banking services, the prudence and&#13;
financial discipline in banking, and the efficient allocation of credit (including bank lending funded in&#13;
future by external donors) to viable activities. The payments system component would facilitate financial&#13;
risk management, reduce the float in the domestic payments system, raise the efficiency and accuracy of&#13;
payments, and thereby stimulate commercial relations between enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
3.78          The Project would follow up, without loss in momentum, on the Bank's Technical&#13;
Assistance Project, by helping implement policies and institution-building programs that were assessed&#13;
and designed under that earlier Project. Enhancing local institutional capacity will still be important in&#13;
the coming years because Kazakhstan's profound economic transition requires technical capacity of&#13;
extraordinary nature and extent.&#13;
3.79          Risks. In a newly created country undergoing fundamental economic transformation there&#13;
is an inevitable risk of policy changes and implementation delays, but in Kazakhstan these risks are worth&#13;
taking in view of the Project's important role for the implementation of critical structural reform.&#13;
(i)  The risk of policy changes is common in transition economies. However, the current direction and&#13;
speed of reform in the financial and enterprise sectors are very encouraging, the country's&#13;
leadership appears strongly supportive to it, and expressed its commitment under an IMF Standby&#13;
Agreement and the Bank's Rehabilitation Loan.&#13;
(ii)  Potentially, other donors could fund the same or similar assistance on a grant basis and thus replace&#13;
the Bank funding, resulting in undisbursed Loan funds. However, the grant funding available to&#13;
Kazakhstan falls well short of the total assistance needs, and close donor coordination during&#13;
project preparation aimed at identifying those areas which are not envisaged to enjoy adequate grant&#13;
support, especially due to their nature or scale.&#13;
(iii) Local groups unfamiliar with the international market levels of fees for consultant services in areas&#13;
like enterprise turnaround, corporate law and banking might regard the proposed use of consultants&#13;
and trainers as too expensive, compared with local public sector salaries. To the extent possible&#13;
without compromising the quality of the consultant services, tenders should therefore include firms&#13;
not only from high-income countries, and encourage the use of local employees and subcontractors.&#13;
It would also be important to communicate effectively the benefits of the assistance.&#13;
(iv)  Delays could occur in project implementation due to limited administrative capacity, unforeseen&#13;
technical complexities in the information systems being procured, or slowness in preparing,&#13;
deciding, and implementing particular reform measures closely related to this Project. This risk&#13;
would be reduced through the establishment of implementation units within the main counterpart&#13;
agencies; substantial assistance for Project implementation; close supervision to assure that&#13;
inefficiencies are addressed promptly; and some contractor payments being tied to critical&#13;
performance milestones.&#13;
IV. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;

are:&#13;
(i)   The establishment of the Rehabilitation Trust in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, which would&#13;
include, in addition to a Presidential Decree and a Government Resolution, the registration of its&#13;
charter and the issuance of appropriate banking licenses by NBK; and&#13;
(ii) the existence of legal and regulatory provisions, satisfactory to the Bank, governing out-of-court&#13;
settlement of debt claims and necessary for the successful functioning of the Rehabilitation Trust,&#13;
such as appropriate legal provisions for foreclosure and debt transfer.&#13;
4.6           Condition for disbursements under the commercial banking development component (see&#13;
Section III.B.2.b) is:&#13;
(i)  the fulfillment, with respect to a commercial bank, of the requirements regarding the procedures&#13;
and accreditation criteria, and the terms and conditions of a subsidiary financing agreement between&#13;
NBK and the respective bank, as set forth in Schedule 1 to the Project Agreement between NBK&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN&#13;
FINANCIAL AND ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
RESTRUCTURING ADVISORY UNIT&#13;
CONCEPT NOTE&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.     Rapidly accumulating enterprise arrears have been placing extreme burdens on the Budget and&#13;
impeding the transition to a market economy. An increasing number of enterprises are insolvent, but continue&#13;
to incur debts without sanction. However, there are few mechanisms to impose financial discipline on the&#13;
enterprises, differentiate commercially viable and non-viable enterprises, and liquidate the latter. At the same&#13;
time, faced with rapidly changing, adverse circumstances, enterprises lack expert advice to help them assess&#13;
their viability and advise them on the means to either adjust and privatize, or liquidate.&#13;
2.     Recognizing the particularly urgent need for professional advisory services to assist with the drastic&#13;
restructuring and liquidation effort aimed at the clients of the central debt resolution institution called&#13;
Rehabilitation Trust, the Ministry of Economy (MOE) is establishing a Restructuring Advisory Unit (RAU).&#13;
Over time, RAU could engage increasingly also in advisory services for other enterprises.&#13;
B. OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.     Primary obiective. The first objective is the provision of professional advisory services to enterprises&#13;
for the preparation of viability assessments, restructuring plans, and liquidation proposals, consistent with the&#13;
demands of competitive markets and taking into account environmental considerations.&#13;
4.     Secondary obiective. The second objective is to build local capability for market-oriented advisory&#13;
services by: (i) training RAU staff, and including local professionals in the RAU's work; (ii) creating and&#13;
testing replicable approaches for viability assessment and restructuring plans; and (iii) developing local&#13;
consulting capabilities by issuing consulting contracts that require considerable participation of local experts.&#13;
By adjusting international best practices to local circumstances and enabling local professionals to use them,&#13;
the RAU will help build private consulting firms, and can itself at some time be commercialized and&#13;
privatized.&#13;
C. ENTERPRISE SELECTION&#13;
5.     First priority. All the debts of up to 40 large, distressed enterprises (LDEs) that constitute the largest&#13;
financial burden for banks, suppliers, and the Budget will be assigned to a debt resolution institution&#13;
("Rehabilitation Trust", RT) established by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The RT will have full financial&#13;
control of the assigned LDEs, including their settlement accounts. The RT will make any financial support&#13;
conditional on the submission, by each LDE, of a viability assessment and then a satisfactory restructuring&#13;
or liquidation plan, and on progress in implementing the plan. The plan needs the advance approval of the&#13;
RT. (See concept note about the RT in Annex III. 1 of this Report)&#13;
6.     LDEs selected for assignment to the RT will be referred by the RT to the RAU for assistance in&#13;
developing their viability assessments and restructuring or liquidation plans. RAU will initially conduct brief&#13;
diagnostic studies (hereafter referred to as "Quick Scan") of these LDEs. The results of the quick scan,&#13;
combined with other analyses that might be available, will enable the RT to categorize the LDEs, set&#13;
approximate performance targets and budget ceilings for the firms for the coming years, and prepare terms&#13;
of references for in-depth restructuring analysis and plans. That in-depth analytical and planning work will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 2 of 8                              Annex II. 1(a)&#13;
be assisted by the RAU in the case of some 25-30 LDEs (out of the up to 40 submitted to the RT) for which&#13;
the cause of distress is not mainly state pricing or trade policies, and which may have a turnaround potential.&#13;
7.      Second priority. The RAU would eventually also help establish viability assessments, restructuring&#13;
plans, and liquidation recommendations for very large and "special" enterprises subject to case-by-case&#13;
privatization but not likely to be sellable without some prior "passive" restructuring, and for medium and large&#13;
enterprises whose shares have not been taken in mass privatization and warrant some "passive restructuring&#13;
before a renewed privatization effort. The enterprises of this second priority would be referred to the RAU&#13;
by the State Property Committee (SPC). The number referred would ultimately depend on available resources;&#13;
it is expected that the RAU would during its first year deal with no more than 4-5 privatization candidates.&#13;
In later years, RAU may gradually shift its resources towards post-privatization restructuring assistance.&#13;
D. OPERATING PRINCIPLES&#13;
8.      LDEs assigned to the RT. The RT (or, before its existence, MOF) would indicate to the RAU the&#13;
overall budget "envelope" available for one year to support the total number of LDEs referred. After receipt&#13;
of the viability assessments, the RT would further indicate a ceiling of its annual financial support for the next&#13;
three years for each LDE individually.  The LDEs would be instructed to keep their restructuring&#13;
recommendations, to be developed with RAU assistance, within these ceilings. Non-viable enterprises would&#13;
receive only resources to see them through liquidation.&#13;
9.      The enterprise assessments and restructuring recommendations must be approved by the RT, and their&#13;
implementation supervised also by the RT. If the RT does not approve a plan, because it exceeds the&#13;
respective ceiling or is deemed unrealistic, or if the implementation schedule is not followed, the RT would&#13;
initiate liquidation. In case of minor deviations, the RT might decide to take other remedial measures instead,&#13;
like replacement of LDE managers.&#13;
10.    Restructuring plans would be limited to "passive" restructuring actions, such as establishment of&#13;
commercial objectives and strategy; corresponding changes in organization, staffing, incentives, financial&#13;
control, products, and marketing; segmentation and spin-off of non-core activities including most social assets;&#13;
and debt restructuring. Investment in substantial new assets would be left to private investors and commercial&#13;
banks. Each restructuring plan should aim at privatization of all or large parts of an LDE as part of the&#13;
timetable.&#13;
11.    Plans for partial or total liquidation will include necessary procedures, guidelines, methods, timing,&#13;
and financial requirements for liquidation. Attempts would be made to agree on voluntary liquidation plans,&#13;
but the RT could also make formal application to SPC for owner-initiated liquidation, or to the courts for a&#13;
"proxy" or liquidator to replace existing management under the new Bankruptcy Law.&#13;
12.    As a general rule, formulation of each restructuring plan shall take not more than 6 months, with the&#13;
enterprise to be given not more than 24 months to implement it.&#13;
13.    Case-by-Case and Mass Privatization Candidates. RAU can assist a few such firms in preparing&#13;
viability assessments and restructuring plans for a minimum amount of "passive" restructuring necessary to&#13;
facilitate sale (see above).  Continued failure to privatize would trigger SPC initiated and supervised&#13;
liquidation.&#13;
14.    Post-Privatization Assistance. With time, RAU may direct the acquired expertise and resources to&#13;
provide advisory services to privatized or private companies, to advise them on improving their operating&#13;
efficiency, enter new markets, and modernize their plant and equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 3 of 8                             Annex II. 1(a)&#13;
E. ORGANIZATION&#13;
15.    Structure. The RAU is being established as an independent unit attached to MOE. The RAU will&#13;
have autonomous status and its own budget. Its head will be appointed, and subject to dismissal, by&#13;
Government decision. The RAU will be headquartered in Almaty. The RAU's divisions would probably&#13;
include: (a) enterprise strategy, organization, and operations; (b) enterprise finance, including cost controls&#13;
and financial modelling; (c) social assets and labor; (d) environment; (e) legal; and (f) administration. RAU&#13;
staff would not exceed ten persons, whose main task will be the issuance and supervision of consultant&#13;
contracts.&#13;
16.    Project Teams. The quick scans will be carried out by at least two teams working simultaneously&#13;
on 15-20 enterprises, respectively. Each team will be headed by one of the resident external consultants, and&#13;
will include two or more short-term consultants, including relevant industry experts, if necessary. The quick&#13;
scan teams will each include at least two RAU permanent staff, who will be trained on-the-job in the process.&#13;
17.    After the quick scans, RAU in coordination with enterprise management will form Project Teams for&#13;
the individual enterprises, or for several enterprises within one subsector. Each Project Team will be headed&#13;
by RAU permanent staff, and include also RAU's resident external consultants. Each Project Team will&#13;
organize, support, and monitor the in-depth analytical and planning work regarding the respective enterprise.&#13;
It will also prepare terms of reference for short-term external consultants to work under the Project Team;&#13;
these consultants will be procured by MOE.&#13;
18.    Working Groups. For each firm, the SPC will organize a Working Group consisting of technical&#13;
experts from the Ministries of Economy and Labor, the relevant branch ministry, and the regional or&#13;
municipal administrations. The Working Group shall be kept informed of the activities of the Project Team&#13;
and shall be invited to work directly with it in their respective fields of expertise. The purpose of the Working&#13;
Group is to provide specific expertise to the Project Team and maintain open lines of comnmunication with the&#13;
communities and institutions most concerned. However, the Working Group shall not have a right to approve&#13;
or disapprove any particular viability assessment or restructuring plan.&#13;
19.    Reporting &amp; Approval. The two quick scan teams will report their findings and recommendations&#13;
to the RT. Each of the Project Teams will work closely with enterprise management and report to the head&#13;
of the RAU. Upon completion of a viability assessment or restructuring plan, the head of RAU will approve&#13;
it and forward it to the LDE for presentation to the RT. The RT will independently approve the plan and&#13;
supervise its implementation. The RAU may provide advice to the LDE also in the implementation phase.&#13;
If the RT does not approve the plan, then it may initiate liquidation or take any other remedial action&#13;
available. The volume of financial support for the LDEs would be the independent decision of the RT, but&#13;
in any case will be limited to the Budget envelope and enterprise specific limits.&#13;
20.    For enterprises not under the RT but referred to the RAU by SPC, implementation of plans would&#13;
be supervised by the SPC unless otherwise agreed with creditors or other owners.&#13;
21.    Staffing.  The RAU headquarters would have few permanent staff, namely, about 10 local&#13;
professionals. They would be permanently assisted by a core team of about 6 long and short-term foreign&#13;
consultants. They would be joined in the initial months by 8-10 short-term consultants to assist only the quick&#13;
scans, and then increasingly by project-specific expert teams; RAU would contract out most of its in-depth&#13;
analytical and planning work to teams of short term consultants. Arrangements for participation of regional&#13;
MOE offices in the work of the RAU would be determined as the scope and location of work becomes&#13;
apparent. They would be engaged primarily in administrative matters such as assisting in contracts and&#13;
logistics for individual Project Teams working in their region. They would work always under the authority&#13;
of the RAU head and would need to be trained by the RAU's permanent central staff and consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 4 of 8                              Annex II. l(a)&#13;
22.    Technical Assistance.&#13;
(i)  Initial short-term consultants would help RAU for about 4 months to establish its internal organization&#13;
and staffing, normative documents, operational and contracting procedures, and information systems&#13;
requirements; identify legal, administrative, and other barriers to the RAU's work and recommend&#13;
remedial action; train RAU staff; define core information requirements; develop procedures for the&#13;
enterprise reviews and plans; and review methods and procedures for voluntary and involuntary&#13;
liquidations. These initial consultants would be funded under the Bank's Technical Assistance Loan.&#13;
(ii) Long-term consultants would be needed for at least 26 months. They would lead the quick scan exercise;&#13;
prepare terms of references for the in-depth strategic assessments of selected LDEs; help strengthen&#13;
RAU's organization and establish its information systems; establish procedures and criteria for viability&#13;
assessments, restructuring and liquidation plans; train staff; assist in preparing enterprise management&#13;
for the work; assist in organizing and monitoring expert teams for specific tasks; assist in the preparation,&#13;
and advise on the implementation, of plans; and advise on the development of liquidation measures.&#13;
(iii) Short-term consultant teams would, jointly with RAU's core staff and advisors, carry out the viability&#13;
"quick scans" of several enterprises, respectively.&#13;
(iv) Further short-term specialized consultants would undertake most of the work on specific enterprises, in&#13;
collaboration with the project teams. Costs could be reduced if one group of consultants provided advice&#13;
to several enterprises in one sub-sector.&#13;
F. RESTRUCTURING PLANS&#13;
23.    Project tasks will be somewhat different in each case. Clearly defined priorities will be established&#13;
early on in each assignment with enterprise management in order to achieve practical results. The main&#13;
elements of the work are likely to include: (i) work preparation, (ii) "quick scans", (iii) in-depth viability and&#13;
strategic assessments; (iv) restructuring or liquidation options; and (v) implementation support.&#13;
(i)  Work PreDaration. This consists of establishing a working relationship with enterprise management,&#13;
informing key people (through the management) about the project, and organizing logistics, work&#13;
timetables and data gathering.&#13;
(ii) Quick Scan. The RT will need to obtain quickly a rough, tentative viability screening of the firms&#13;
referred to it. Such a check will provide the basis for the preparation of the budget ceilings, and will&#13;
help draft the terms of reference for in-depth viability and strategic assessments, if deemed necessary.&#13;
The quick scan should not take more than one or two weeks per firms, depending on size and complexity.&#13;
The quick scans will be carried out by RAU on behalf of the RT.&#13;
(iii) In-Depth Viability and Strategic Assessment. Such studies typically consider, among other things:&#13;
*  Outputs: Quality and prices of products and services; customer profiles and market forecasts;&#13;
transport and distribution networks; relative market positions and comparative advantages (locally,&#13;
within the FSU, and beyond the FSU); state policies that impact on marketing (such as price, export,&#13;
tax, and currency exchange regulations, trade agreements, and state orders); and risks and&#13;
opportunities for growth;&#13;
*  Inputs: The quantity, quality, reliability, and relative cost of material inputs; state policies that&#13;
impact on their availability, price, and use; and purchasing procedures and management;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

measures; and&#13;
*  Summary Assessment:  Current economic and financial performance; plans of the enterprise for&#13;
solvency and sustainability; strenghts and weaknesses, and risks and opportunities; forecast of&#13;
profitability and solvency (under different scenarios).&#13;
(iv) Restructuring/Liquidation Options. In tandem with the in-depth assessment, restructuring and liquidation&#13;
recommendations are formed and typically include the following, among other things:&#13;
*  Strategy Definition: This exercise redefines the commercial objectives of the enterprise in light of&#13;
the viability assessment. Different scenarios are considered for devising a strategy to achieve the&#13;
commercial goals, taking into account possible, realistic, near term adjustments such as&#13;
discontinuation of certain production, changes in inputs, reduction of the work force, termination of&#13;
cross-subsidies, charging of market prices for social services and government-directed provision of&#13;
goods and services. Necessary modest iimprovements are taken into account. Also considered is the&#13;
impact of the regulatory regime governing the enterprise, particularly where a degree of monopoly&#13;
power exists.&#13;
The strategy definition aims at defining conditions for solvency and financial sustainability. It&#13;
therefore includes corporate finance modelling taking into account financial ratios necessary for&#13;
solvency, and cash based analyses of operations and business plans. Based on this modelling, the&#13;
strategy sets potentially achievable financial performance targets, taking into consideration interest&#13;
and dividend cover, return on capital, and investments.&#13;
*  Restructuring Actions and Liquidation Recommendations: Taking into consideration the viability&#13;
assessment and the strategy definition, recommendations are made for stabilization measures,&#13;
including the segmentation and privatization, or liquidation, of assets, lines of business or the entire&#13;
enterprise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 6 of 8                              Annex II.l(a)&#13;
To support these fundamental recommendations, related advice is provided for the following:&#13;
-   optimum timing, financial requirements and methods of liquidations;&#13;
-   organizational, technical and financial restructuring;&#13;
-   measures to increase labor productivity and reduce overstaffing;&#13;
-   improved information management systems; and&#13;
-   improvements for marketing, production and productivity improvements that do not require&#13;
significant investments.&#13;
Options will also be provided, with comparative costs, for divestment of social assets or contracting&#13;
out of their management, and remedies for environmental problems. Where liquidation of assets or&#13;
business lines is recommended, the timing and method of the treatment of social assets, financial&#13;
liabilities, and environment problems will indicated in detailed.&#13;
(v) Implementation Support. The RAU could potentially also offer to the enterprises on-going advice on the&#13;
implementation of particular restructuring or liquidation measures.&#13;
G. ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES&#13;
24.    Quick Review. Part of the preliminary viability review should be a rough review of: past pollution&#13;
and the resulting impact and risks to environment and health; current pollution levels compared with standards&#13;
and considering the location; main sources and reasons of this pollution, including effectiveness of&#13;
environmental management organization, monitoring systems, state of equipment, material use, spill control,&#13;
emergency response procedures, etc.; the main possibilities of improved pollution monitoring and reduction,&#13;
and of eventual clean-up; and the order of magnitude of associated costs.&#13;
25.    Detailed Analysis and Restructuring Plan. The in-depth strategy analysis of the firm will include a&#13;
more detailed review or audit of the above environmental factors, with its scope depending on the case (e.g.,&#13;
including preparation of a materials balance for key facilities). It will include also a detailed estimate of the&#13;
current and investment costs of measures aimed at enhancing pollution monitoring and control at the enterprise&#13;
(to reach existing or expected standards within a time frame), and the costs and benefits of potential future&#13;
clean-up, especially in case of liquidation. Priority attention will be given to measures that enhance general&#13;
efficiency and profitability of the firm (e.g., energy efficiency, material yields, etc.) while at the same time&#13;
reducing pollution. Timetables and scope for pollution reduction, and especially clean-up, need to consider&#13;
financial constraints.&#13;
26.    Privatization. Environmental advisors to the RAU will advise on environmental liabilities and clean-&#13;
up in the course of privatization of firms assisted by the RAU. It is assumed that GOK will principally assume&#13;
liabilities arising from past pollution, but may negotiate with investors obligations on his part (as part of the&#13;
privatization agreement) to undertake specific clean-up measures.&#13;
27.    Environment Expertise. One member of the core external advisor team to the RAU will be an&#13;
environmental specialist who will advise on related policy and contractual issues, train RAU staff, lead the&#13;
environmental part of the quick scans, and help arrange short-term environmental expert teams. The&#13;
environmental work (including environmental reviews or audits) as part of the in-depth strategy analysis and&#13;
restructuring planning will be supported by short-term consultant visits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 7 of 8                              Annex II.l(a)&#13;
H. OTHER SPECIAL ISSUES IN RESTRUCTURING&#13;
28.     Financial Restructuring. The RAU will propose in its plans a menu of debt relief techniques tied to&#13;
its financial projections. Implementation will generally depend on agreement between owner(s), management&#13;
and creditor(s). For LDEs under the RT, the RT will review and decide on debt relief measures.&#13;
29.    Government Imposed Obligations. Government orders to enterprises, e.g., to operate social assets&#13;
or to provide certain goods or services, will be identified, and their costs to the enterprises quantified.&#13;
Possibilities of cost recovery through adequate prices charged to users, or through financial compensation by&#13;
the authorities, will be elaborated, and their financial impact assessed. The relative competitiveness and&#13;
sustainability of continued provision of the services by the enterprise will be evaluated.&#13;
30.    Investment. Plans established with RAU's help may include recommendations for new investments,&#13;
but such investments will not be provided by the RT (except for spare parts). Instead, they are to come from&#13;
commercial banks once the "passive" restructuring is implemented, or from private local and foreign investors.&#13;
31.    Privatization. To the extent that the restructuring plans do not provide for liquidation, every plan&#13;
is to include, or lead to, privatization in full or in part as a priority goal. Opportunities for privatization&#13;
should be not be disregarded pending implementation or completion of the plans. The privatization would be&#13;
carried out by SPC.&#13;
I. LIQUIDATIONS&#13;
32.    Voluntary Liquidation. The imposition of a hard budget constraint by the RT (and other creditors)&#13;
will force a number of enterprises to initiate voluntarily their full or partial liquidations, without the need to&#13;
initiate legal process. Liquidations recommended by enterprises (with RAU assistance) in their own plans,&#13;
and accepted by the RAU (and other creditors), or demanded by the RT or other creditors and accepted by&#13;
a cooperative management, may be undertaken voluntarily by enterprise management under the supervision&#13;
of the RT, with advice from the RAU.&#13;
33.    Imposed Liguidation.  Liquidations may be imposed by the RT or other creditors, either on&#13;
application to SPC or by application to the court under law. In either case, the RT (and other creditors) must&#13;
have the legal possibility to rapidly replace enterprise management with a liquidator/administrator, in order&#13;
to implement liquidation in a controlled fashion. The RT would need to impose the liquidation, e.g., if the&#13;
existing management is not willing, capable or trusted to carry out the liquidation. The RT-appointed&#13;
liquidator would replace management also in cases where a liquidation starts voluntarily but then fails to meet&#13;
the timetables, or otherwise dissatisfies the RT. The liquidator would have the necessary independent powers&#13;
and manpower to initiate and supervise the implementation of liquidation, and of other restructuring actions&#13;
required by the RT.&#13;
34.    Asset Sale. The sale of assets and business units of the enterprise, both under voluntary and -- upon&#13;
RT request -- imposed liquidations, could be handled by SPC's relevant departments in charge of privatization,&#13;
which have substantial experience in the sale of assets and going concerns through competitive methods.&#13;
Potentially, SPC could consider establishing a special division for the sale of assets of liquidated enterprises.&#13;
To which extent such a SPC division, or rather RAU, could also advise enterprises on the liquidation-related&#13;
issues such as labor termination, minority shareholders' rights, contracts, social assets, termination of leases&#13;
and contracts, and transfers of financial, environmental and other liabilities, needs to be further reviewed.&#13;
&#13;

J. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RESTRUCTURING ADVISORY UNIT&#13;
35.    World Bank Support. Starting in March 1995 a short-term consultant will assist the already on-going&#13;
establishment of the RAU, funded under the Bank's Technical Assistance Loan. Starting in about June 1995,&#13;
assistance will be provided for the operation of RAU, as specified in the draft terms of reference shown in&#13;
Annex 11. I(b).&#13;
I. NECESSARY CONTEXT&#13;
36.    Economic Context. Successful restructuring requires a certain degree of macroeconomic stability and&#13;
market liberalization, so that meaningful signals guide restructuring. Both are expected to be the case during&#13;
the years of the RAU's operation.&#13;
37.    Enterprise Governance. Enterprises can only be expected to restructure and operate efficiently if they&#13;
are under effective governance. Clear lines of management accountability for performance to owners (which&#13;
in initial cases will be the state as represented by SPC, to be followed by private owners after the privatization&#13;
of the firms as part of their restructuring), and the imposition of a hard budget constraint particularly by the&#13;
RT, are essential for success.&#13;
38.    Legal Framework. The new draft Bankruptcy Law is expected to be adopted in the first half of 1995,&#13;
and provisions for out-of-court conciliation and liquidation are being developed with donor assistance. The&#13;
latter in particular should be harmonized with concepts embodied in the RT/RAU framework. The legal&#13;
framework for collateral/pledges, and for property rights and contracts in general, is expected to be&#13;
strengthened as well in the first half of 1995, especially through the issuance of a new Civil Code.&#13;
39.    Private Consultant Services. Licensing, tax, and other rules for service professionals should be&#13;
reviewed with a view to facilitating the emergence of private advisory services.&#13;
40.    Environment. To be enforceable, environmental standards need to be realistic and possibly in line&#13;
with international standards, and would best be imposed along a pre-announced timetable that allows existing&#13;
facilities to adjust to them. The monitoring and legal enforcement capacity of the Ministry of Ecology and&#13;
Bio-Resources (MEBR) is being strengthened with Bank assistance. Work on the policy framework regarding&#13;
contingent liabilities from past pollution has started, and would be further advanced through the experience&#13;
and assistance under this Project.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN&#13;
FINANCIAL AND ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
RESTRUCTURING ADVISORY UNIT&#13;
CORE TECHNICAL ADVISORS TEAM&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.     Kazakhstan's economy is undergoing a transition from  central planning, state ownership, closed&#13;
markets and high specialization to decentralized market mechanisms, private ownership, and open international&#13;
competition. In the course of this transition, enterprises are now required to take serious measures to adjust&#13;
to entirely different circumstances. The primary objectives of enterprises under the old system were to increase&#13;
their production capacity, output and employment. There was little emphasis on return on investment,&#13;
efficiency or market demand. Enterprises were simply production units that responded to the directives of&#13;
governmental plans. Enterprise management had little autonomy. Nor was there financial discipline or&#13;
accountability imposed on enterprises. Investment and working capital were mostly financed from the&#13;
government budget or loans from the banking system, according to governmental plans, often without effective&#13;
repayment obligations. Extensive social services further burdened enterprises. Consequently, many of&#13;
Kazakhstan's enterprises are not well suited for operating in a market economy.&#13;
2.      The exact financial status and viability of most enterprises are not well known, due to weaknesses in&#13;
accounting and statistics, high inflation, long delays in inter-republican payments, rapid changes in the&#13;
economic environment, and other factors. By mid-1994, liquidity became very tight and there has been a rapid&#13;
growth in payment arrears, severely straining the Budget and impacting output. As a result a large number&#13;
of enterprises are financially insolvent. This problem is expected to increase as energy prices move towards&#13;
international levels and interest rates rise towards positive levels in real terms. Yet, so far only limited&#13;
restructuring and liquidation has taken place.&#13;
3.     In view of the need for adequate incentives for restructuring, substantial restructuring of enterprises&#13;
is in principle better left to the new owners after privatization.' However, there are several circumstances&#13;
justifying governmental intervention. One of them is the current situation where the government has become&#13;
a substantial creditor with little discipline to stop the ever mounting arrears which now also endanger&#13;
privatization. Restructuring is traditionally driven by creditors with the burden on debtors to demonstrate&#13;
viability, sustainability and prospects for turnaround. However, the ability of Kazakhstan's enterprises to&#13;
undertake restructuring design and implementation is hampered by the scarcity of the requisite professional&#13;
managerial and technical advisory services which have become essential for operating in a market economy.&#13;
4.      As part of a comprehensive program  to address these problems, the Government has formed the&#13;
Rehabilitation Trust (RT) under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to assume the debts of the&#13;
largest distressed enterprises (LDEs). The RT, as creditor, is to impose financial discipline on the LDEs,&#13;
' The share majority of more than 2,000 medium and large scale state enterprises (200-5,000 employees) are supposed&#13;
to be included in the mass privatization program. These shares will be held directly by the State Property Committee until&#13;
such time as those shares are transferred to the investment funds that participate in the share auctions (with privatization&#13;
investment coupons that they mobilize from the citizens). Very large commercial state enterprises (more than 5,000&#13;
employees) and state enterprises in certain special sectors like energy and mining/metallurgy will not be included in the&#13;
mass privatization program but eventually be privatized on a case-by-case basis as soon as the investment climate,&#13;
privatization implementation capacity, and regulatory environment permit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 2 of 6                              Annex II.;(b)&#13;
liquidating them, unless they can convince the RT that they are economically viable and financially sustainable&#13;
in a competitive market environment. The RT has required each such LDE to provide it with a viability&#13;
assessment and restructuring or liquidation plan, designed to sustain or liquidate the enterprise within the limits&#13;
of a strictly defined budget "envelope".&#13;
5.     To satisfy enterprises' needs for professional advisory services, the Ministry of Economy (MOE) has&#13;
established the Restructuring Advisory Unit (RAU). The RAU is an independent unit attached to the MOE.&#13;
The RAU has been asked to give its first priority to providing advisory services to LDEs assigned to the RT.&#13;
The RAU's other, minor, task is to support the privatization programs of the SPC through pre-privatization&#13;
advice to enterprises. A full description of the objectives, priorities, structure and tasks of the RAU are set&#13;
forth as an annex hereto, which is an integral part of these Terms of Reference (TOR). A description of the&#13;
RT is set forth as a further annex to these terms of references for informational purposes.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
6.     The primary object of this Project is to assist the RAU provide professional advisory services to&#13;
enterprises in satisfaction of RT requirements. The second object is to train RAU staff and build capacity for&#13;
market based advisory services.&#13;
C. ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
7.     The contract will be awarded to one company ("the Consultants") to provide the RAU with a Core&#13;
Team of four full-time, resident, long-term consultants as well as two to three short-term consultants to work&#13;
directly with the RAU for a period of 14 months, commencing in approximately May, 1995. The long-term&#13;
resident consultants will include three enterprise restructuring experts, including one with extensive legal&#13;
training and experience, and one environmental specialist. The resident consultants will be supported,&#13;
especially during critical strategy development phases of the project, by a non-resident senior restructuring&#13;
expert. Other institution strengthening experts, such as management information system specialists, will be&#13;
used on an as needed basis.&#13;
8.    Immediately after the start-up of the project, the Core Team will lead the quick diagnostic review&#13;
(hereafter referred to as "quick scan") of LDEs designated by the RT. It is expected that approximately 30&#13;
LDEs will be included in the "Quick Scan" exercise. The level of effort would not exceed about three person-&#13;
weeks per LDE and should be completed within six months. It is thus expected that two teams will&#13;
simultaneously carry out the "Quick Scan" at designated LDEs. Each team will be lead by one of the long-&#13;
term resident advisors and will include additional short-term consultants and industry experts. Each team will&#13;
also include at least two RAU staff, who will both assist the team and receive on-the-job training.&#13;
9.     The external experts may be backed up, as required, by their home offices, but the assistance strategy&#13;
is to provide the RAU with a team of highly qualified, long and short-term consultants performing their work&#13;
in Kazakhstan, thus providing continuity of assistance on site. One of the three long-term consultants will be&#13;
an environmental specialist. It is understood that the consultants may need to draw expertise from one or more&#13;
specialized firms. The Consultants are therefore encouraged to combine with other consulting firms as&#13;
necessary.&#13;
10.   It is expected that at the end of the term of the contract awarded under these Terms of Reference,&#13;
another contract will be awarded to continue a Core Team for another term of one year. The precise terms&#13;
of reference for the follow-on contract will be determined according to the progress and needs of the work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 3 of 6                              Annex 11. l(b)&#13;
11.    The Consultants will coordinate with other consultant teams under the World Bank's various assistance&#13;
projects who will deal concurrently with strengthening the SPC and the legal and policy foundations for the&#13;
case-by-case privatization of very large and special enterprises; assisting in the mass privatization program;&#13;
enhancing state enterprise governance; enhancing the regulatory and foreign investment framework generally&#13;
and the mining sector in particular. The Consultants will liaise with a team of consultants undertaking pilot&#13;
restructuring exercises for the Karaganda Metallurgical Combinate and the Achysai Polymetallic Combinate&#13;
and also with EU-TACIS, USAID and EBRD funded consultants working on the restructuring and&#13;
privatization of some very large enterprises.&#13;
D. COUNTERPARTS AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
12.    The counterpart is the RAU attached to MOE. In their work on individual enterprises, as well as the&#13;
related skill transfer, the Consultants will also enjoy logistical and administrative support, as well as specific&#13;
advice on local circumstances, from staff of the relevant oblast-level economic departments, which in these&#13;
particular tasks shall work directly under the authority of the RAU head and RAU's leader of the specific&#13;
project.&#13;
13.   In their practical case work and skills transfer, the Consultants will work closely with enterprise&#13;
management and, as directed by the RAU, with staff of other institutions concerned with particular cases. The&#13;
collaboration with counterpart personnel should help reach consensus on the enterprise analysis and&#13;
restructuring and liquidation recommendations.&#13;
14.    A Project Implementation Unit (PIU), located in MOE (currently within the National Agency for&#13;
Foreign Investment, NAFI), will be responsible for supporting procurement, contractual and logistical&#13;
arrangements, as well as for disbursements.&#13;
E. ACTIVITIES AND OUTPUTS&#13;
15.   The Consultants will have three main tasks, listed below in order of priority:&#13;
(i)   assist the RAU in meeting its objectives and priorities (as described in detail in the attached concept&#13;
note), by organizing, carrying out and supervising the provision of professional advisory services,&#13;
limited to the assisting LDEs in satisfying the RT's requirements for quick scans, in-depth viability and&#13;
strategic assessments, and restructuring and liquidation plans;&#13;
(ii)  train RAU, enterprise staff, and as feasible also staff of MOE and SPC involved in liquidation or&#13;
restructuring, in the goals, techniques, methodologies and implementation of viability assessments,&#13;
restructuring and liquidation exercises; and&#13;
(iii)  develop replicable models, case studies, written manuals and commentary on viability assessments,&#13;
restructuring and liquidation exercises.&#13;
16.   Responsibilities and duties of the Consultants under the first and second tasks would include assisting&#13;
the RAU as follows:&#13;
(i)   carry out the quick scan (as defined in the attached concept note);&#13;
(ii)   assist in the preparation of terms of references for in-depth viability and strategic assessments,&#13;
combined with restructuring and liquidation plans; and offer assistance and guidance to the short-term&#13;
teams carrying out this in-depth assessment and planning work;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 4 of 6                              Annex 11. l(b)&#13;
(iii)  review the list of enterprises referred to the RAU and determine which economies of scale can and&#13;
should be achieved by combining certain of them for analysis by one single Project Team. It is possible&#13;
that a large number of LDEs may be referred to the RAU, almost at once, early in the Project. The&#13;
Consultants should assist RAU in combining groups of them by sub-sector, size, location or other&#13;
characteristics in order to reduce the number of Project Teams and related contracts to a manageable,&#13;
but still efficient number;&#13;
(iv)   assist in the preparation of the enterprises for the work, working with enterprise management,&#13;
establishing a likely timetable, and collecting the data needed for inclusion into tenders for the Project&#13;
Team consultants;&#13;
(v)   prepare terms of reference for each Project Team, including consideration of the required Team skill&#13;
mix and applicable budget constraints, and also preparation of the necessary information memorandum&#13;
for bidders;&#13;
(vi)  supervise management of Project Teams, including participation as Team Leader in certain cases as&#13;
RAU deems appropriate, in the implementation of the viability analyses and restructuring and&#13;
liquidation recommendations;&#13;
(vii)  prepare critical paths and scheduling of the Project Team tenders and their work plans, including&#13;
monitoring of their performance and timeliness of deliveries;&#13;
(viii) plan and implement office and management systems necessary for the RAU to efficiently manage and&#13;
monitor the Project Team work. Some of the necessary systems would include:&#13;
* compilation of all legislation, regulations, decrees, opinion letters from local and foreign counsel;&#13;
* an information database on enterprises referred by the RT and SPC;&#13;
* a "case book" and "file box" whereby all relevant documents and computer discs pertaining to a&#13;
particular enterprise would be maintained together;&#13;
* a system to efficiently monitor conclusions and rationale and recommendations of the Project Teams;&#13;
and&#13;
* a backup system for all critical documents and electronic data.&#13;
(ix)   assist in development of specific viability assessment, restructuring and liquidation recommendations.&#13;
This work includes development of techniques, methodologies, procedures, and means of&#13;
implementation based on international best practice and consistent with the legal, social, environmental&#13;
and economic conditions prevailing in Kazakhstan. It is envisaged that the establishment of these&#13;
assessments and recommendations address the main elements listed in detail under the heading "Tasks"&#13;
in the attached concept note for the RAU.&#13;
17.   In connection with the Consultants' second task, the local learning experience should be multiplied&#13;
through the following arrangements:&#13;
(i)     The analytical work shall be conducted jointly with enterprise staff;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 5 of 6                              Annex II.l(b)&#13;
(ii)    the main methodology and other lessons on the formulation of viability assessments, restructuring&#13;
and liquidation plans learned from particularly instructive cases chosen by the Consultants, shall be&#13;
documented, and translated into Russian;&#13;
(iii)   in the course of their work, Consultants team members shall conduct informal training sessions on&#13;
the methods and issues of the particular work, as well as on enterprise restructuring in general. The&#13;
total number of days of such training, commensurate with the limited funding of the project, shall&#13;
be indicated in the Consultants' proposal; and&#13;
(iv)    the Consultants will give a formal presentation of their reports to, and discuss them with, the officials&#13;
of the RAU, the RT, and other agencies or creditors concerned, and the enterprises' management.&#13;
F. REPORTING&#13;
18.    The Consultants will first submit an inception report to the RAU and the World Bank for approval,&#13;
within one month after the agreed starting date of the assignment. The inception report would, inter alia,&#13;
refine the proposed methodology and project timetable; clarify information requirements that the authorities&#13;
and the enterprises need to satisfy to permit the studies; and report on any problems encountered or expected,&#13;
and remedies taken or proposed. At the end of month three, the Consultants will submit a brief progress&#13;
report; it will list past and planned activities, outputs, and inputs, and report problems encountered and&#13;
remedies introduced or proposed. At the end of the assignment, the Consultants will submit a final report that&#13;
lists all the activities, output, and inputs of the Consultants and summarizes the main practical problems&#13;
encountered in carrying out the assignment. These three administrative reports -- interim, progress, and final&#13;
report -- shall be submitted to RAU and MOE in one English and two Russian copies, respectively; to the&#13;
World Bank in two English copies; and to further agencies or the RT as seen appropriate by the Consultants&#13;
and the RAU.&#13;
19.    The substantial findings and recommendations for each enterprise shall be documented in a technical&#13;
report.   Each report will each include two parts: viability analysis and restructuring/liquidation&#13;
recommendations. Detailed enterprise-specific information shall be presented in separate annexes, to facilitate&#13;
safeguarding confidentiality. Each technical report shall first be submitted in draft final form to the RAU and&#13;
the World Bank for comment. The finalized versions shall then be submitted in one English and two Russian&#13;
copies to the LDE or enterprise, and two English copies to the World Bank.&#13;
G. CONSULTANT QUALIFICATIONS&#13;
20.    The Consultants will be selected on the basis of their proposal (including also the training activities),&#13;
the qualifications of the firm, and the adequacy of the team members including the project manager. Team&#13;
members should have extensive proven expertise in enterprise restructuring, with a substantial exposure to the&#13;
industrial sectors in formerly socialist economies, especially Eastern Europe and the CIS. At least one&#13;
member will have extensive, practical experience in liquidations, another should be a management specialist,&#13;
and both of these should have corporate finance experience. A third will be an environmental specialist with&#13;
extensive experience in managing environmental audits and contacts concerning experts qualified to make&#13;
technical and cost assessments of damage, clean-up, remedial and prevention measures. Experience dealing&#13;
with social assets in transitional economies would be useful. Russian or Kazakh language facility would also&#13;
be very useful for the assignment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

H. INPUTS AND FUNDING&#13;
21.    The consultant contract will cover:&#13;
* fees including overhead;&#13;
* consultant travel, accommnodation, and living expenses;&#13;
* project-related communication, report distribution, and office supplies;&#13;
* translation, interpretation, English and Russian language secretarial support; and&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN&#13;
FINANCIAL AND ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
STUDY TOUR PROGRAM FOR ENTERPRISE MANAGERS&#13;
CONCEPT NOTE&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The Republic of Kazakhstan suffers from a scarcity of modern management and marketing capabilities&#13;
in both production and service enterprises, stemming primarily from a legacy of isolation and lack of contact&#13;
with world markets. Over the past seventy years, the socialist command system, together with a bias towards&#13;
military production and capital goods rather than consumer goods, have created rigid patterns of management&#13;
practice that are not well suited to a more flexible, market-oriented environment. At the enterprise level,&#13;
many managers were in the past accustomed to focus on the management of physical production and the&#13;
procurement of inputs, rather than on market-oriented tasks like corporate strategy planning, product&#13;
development, market research, marketing, financial management, and so forth.&#13;
2.    A modern market economy requires building the knowledge by all market participants of a wide&#13;
variety of implicit and explicit rules and procedures that enable a market economy to function. It also requires&#13;
an array of institutions that facilitate the smooth functioning of these markets. This "market infrastructure"&#13;
of capabilities and institutional experience that together make up the organizational backbone of a market&#13;
economy has taken decades to develop in the Western market economies. The Republic of Kazakhstan,&#13;
however, lacks much of this experience, and lacks the time needed for know-how to develop in a slow,&#13;
incremental fashion. This learning process is further complicated by the demands of managing short-term&#13;
crises during the country's transition phase.&#13;
3.    To effectively jump-start the process of development of market-supportive capabilities and institutions,&#13;
some mechanisms may be more effective than others. Many managers and support institutions in Kazakhstan&#13;
lack exposure to modern management, production and marketing practices, and to the operation of market-&#13;
supportive institutions. Formal training courses and seminars are effective mechanisms to transfer some types&#13;
of information, but certain aspects of the functioning of a market economy can best be transferred by having&#13;
people see for themselves what works. Study tours, if very rigorously organized to meet specific needs, can&#13;
be an effective training mechanisms for this. After the Second World War, the United States invited many&#13;
thousand enterprise managers from Western Europe to rigorously designed study tours of companies in&#13;
America. This mechanism accomplished a rapid, wide-scale, and effective transfer of modern business know-&#13;
how. For the former Soviet Union countries whose enterprise managers, similar to Western Europe after the&#13;
War, are well educated and experienced but lack exposure to international practices, this model promises to&#13;
be very useful.&#13;
4.    On a pilot basis, two first study tours have taken place in June 1994 with funding by the World Bank&#13;
and in collaboration with the Ministry of Economy, after an initial seminar hosted by the Government's&#13;
Institute for Improvement of Professional Skills and organized by the World Bank's Economic Development&#13;
Institute (EDI). One tour brought about 15 garment industry managers for 4 weeks to Taiwan, and the other&#13;
tour took 15 fruit and vegetable processing industry managers to the United States. The preparation and&#13;
conduct of these tours have provided useful and encouraging experience. Expanding the scope of the tour&#13;
program several-fold, and raising its cost efficiency, calls for some changes of the initial arrangements that&#13;
are incorporated in this text. With those adjustments, the program could be funded for about a year starting&#13;
in spring 1995 by the proposed Financial and Enterprises Development Project of the World Bank and&#13;
supported by business organizations in the host countries, and further expanded with the funding of other&#13;
donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. OBJECTIVES&#13;
5.     The longer-run objective of this project component is to have a rapid and sustained impact on the&#13;
enterprise sector of Kazakhstan's economy. It attempts to do so by transferring a wide range of know how,&#13;
and creating catalysts for market-oriented change at the enterprise level and in key market support institutions.&#13;
The know how would relate mainly to business management and enterprise operations, but also to market&#13;
organization and government policies. The impact would be multiplied through systemic dissemination and&#13;
follow-up efforts within Kazakhstan.&#13;
6.     About 160 managers of enterprises and support institutions would directly participate in the tours under&#13;
the Project. In the process, it would allow to further fine-tune the methodology, and test the organizational&#13;
arrangements in Kazakhstan and the host countries.  Having a well-proven approach and experienced&#13;
institutional partners should make attracting funding for further tours from other donor institutions, beyond&#13;
1995, easier. Moreover, Kazakhstan's experience with the program would also help other CIS countries&#13;
replicate the study tour model.&#13;
C. ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
(i)  Nature of the Tours. Critical for the success of the program is the intensity of the learning experience&#13;
of the participants, and the wide multiplication of this experience in Kazakhstan. This requires that the&#13;
tours be preceded by specific seminar training in Kazakhstan; be well prepared and densely scheduled;&#13;
involve continuous discussion and written reflection of findings while in the field; involve all participants&#13;
in disseminating their findings through writing of joint reports, conduct of seminars, and other means;&#13;
and involve further follow-up activities in the longer term in collaboration between the participants and&#13;
program institutions. Also important for direct future application of the acquired knowledge is the team&#13;
approach. In order to participate in the program, the enterprises will have to propose qualified&#13;
managerial teams of 2-3 people. The selection for both the in-country seminar and the study tour will&#13;
be based on the principle that the team-average score is the qualifying factor.&#13;
(ii) Host Countries and Sub-Sectors. The program will send carefully selected individuals from Kazakhstan&#13;
to more developed countries in North America, Western Europe and/or the Far East. The final country&#13;
selection will largely depend on the cooperation of adequate host organizations, but also on travel costs&#13;
and on the characteristics of the respective economic sub-sectors. The economic sub-sector will be&#13;
chosen by the Steering Committee in agreement with the host country institutions and the World Bank.&#13;
The main selection criteria should be the likely impact study tours will have on the sub-sectors; highly&#13;
monopolized or regulated sub-sectors such as public utilities would be avoided. The sub-sector selection&#13;
will take into account host country arrangements, if applicable. The general program for each study&#13;
tour, and principles underlying any necessary last-minute modifications, will be proposed by the host&#13;
country institution, subject to the approval of the Steering Committee and final review of the World&#13;
Bank.&#13;
In the event that host country institutions choose to play limited roles, consultants will be retained to assist&#13;
in the design, organization and management of the study tours.&#13;
(iii) Number of Tours and Participants. The World Bank Project itself would support 10 study tours with&#13;
about 16 tour participants each, thus totalling some 160 tour participants. The pre-tour seminars would&#13;
involve about twice this number of persons, i.e. about 32 trainees for each of the ten seminars. As a&#13;
rule, each enterprise selected to participate would send 2-3 people to attend the pre-tour seminar. The&#13;
tour participants would be selected from among those seminar participants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 3 of 8                                     Annex II.2&#13;
In addition to the trainees themselves, the tour team would include one or two interpreters with strong&#13;
language and secretarial skills. It could also include one technical writer with foreign language skills&#13;
and relevant industry background, who would assist the compilation of the team reports in publishable&#13;
form. Furthermore, most tours would include one further person, either staff of the Tour Program&#13;
Secretariat (TPS), a staff of another Government agency, or a trainer from the participating local training&#13;
institutions; this shall enhance their effectiveness in tour program management and training. The total&#13;
number of tour participants from Kazakhstan would therefore be a maximum of 20.&#13;
The tour team would be accompanied in the host country by an external consultant and/or staff of the&#13;
host country institution.&#13;
A key feature of the program is its emphasis on widespread dissemination of these participants' findings&#13;
to other managers in their sub-sectors, to multiply their new know-how in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the&#13;
tours would lay the basis for a larger number of further tours funded by other organizations. Thus, the&#13;
total number of tour participants might exceed the above 160 in this Project's one-year period, and might&#13;
expand in subsequent years.&#13;
(iv)  Trainees' Background and Oualifications. The program aims mainly at managers of medium and large&#13;
enterprises, and of some rapidly growing new enterprises, who have the proven capability and decision-&#13;
making authority to introduce changes in their organizations based on what they know and learn. Some&#13;
preference will be given to private or privatized companies. Also included in the tours could be a&#13;
maximum of two staff (per tour) from institutions that are most critical in supporting the transition to&#13;
a market economy, such as training, research, and policy-making institutions. Each study tour would&#13;
concentrate on one single economic sub-sector, such as the pilot study tour in the garments subsector&#13;
in mid-1994. The sub-sectors could be from the industrial (including agro-business) and service sectors,&#13;
including sectors that provide professional business services like market research or advertising to other&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
(v)  Trainee Selection. The trainee selection would follow a two-step process: Selection to the pre-tour&#13;
seminar, and selection from there to a study tour. The participants of the pre-tour seminars would be&#13;
selected according to the following mechanism. The planned seminar and tour for a sub-sector would&#13;
be widely publicized through the media like local business journals and newspapers but also radio and&#13;
possibly television, through public offices, and through information given to enterprise unions and&#13;
similar associations; the objective of the marketing will be to indiscriminately reach all enterprise of the&#13;
chosen subsector. The announcement would include the fee charged to enterprises for each participant&#13;
for the pre-tour seminar, and the selection criteria in case that the number of interested enterprises and&#13;
applicants for the seminar exceeds the available space. The selection will be undertaken by the training&#13;
institutions in collaboration with the consultants/trainers based strictly on the published criteria. The&#13;
selection criteria would mainly be objective ones that can be easily measured.' These criteria will be&#13;
The scoring criteria for selection to the pre-tour seminar have been tentatively agreed as follows:&#13;
(i)   Number of staff (&gt;500: 10 points; 200-500: 5 points; &lt;200: 0 points)&#13;
(ii)  Rapid growth of the company (growth of employees during 1994 &gt;50%: 5 points)&#13;
(iii)  Share of output from the tour sub-sector in total output (&gt; 51 %: 10 points)&#13;
(iv)  Location (outside Almaty City and Almaty Oblast: 5 points)&#13;
(v)  Management level of team member (high: 10 points; medium: 5 points)&#13;
(vi)  Length of professional service (&gt;5 years: 10 points; 2-5 years: 5 points)&#13;
(vii) Education of team members (tertiary: 10 points; secondary: 5 points)&#13;
(viii) Age (&lt;35 years: 10 points; 35-55 years: 5 points)&#13;
(ix)  Foreign language proficiency (English or host country language: 10 points)&#13;
(x)  Initial summary business plan (submitted: 10 points).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 4 of 8                                 Annex 11.2&#13;
agreed on in principle upon negotiations of the World Bank Loan, and approved in detail by the Steering&#13;
Committee in agreement with the World Bank. As a basis for this selection, the applicants would submit&#13;
their resumes, descriptions of their firms, and brief tentative development plans for their enterprises. The&#13;
selection will be made based on the team-average scores. The proposed team from each enterprise will&#13;
number no less than two and no more than three people.&#13;
The tour participants will be selected from among the seminar participants strictly according to a set of&#13;
further pre-determined criteria developed by TPS in discussion with the World Bank and the local&#13;
training institutions, and approved by the Steering Committee and the World Bank. These selection&#13;
criteria will relate mainly to the qualification of the seminar participants as demonstrated by the seminar&#13;
performance. The evaluation will be done by the seminar trainers. It will be critical that unqualified&#13;
candidates not succeed in entering the tour teams despite influences that might be exerted on their behalf.&#13;
Again, the selection principle will be team performance.&#13;
7.     Program Evaluation. To ensure maximum effectiveness of the study tour program in the longer run,&#13;
the experience and learning results of the tours need to be carefully reviewed, lessons drawn, and adjustments&#13;
made to the approach, organization, and procedures. For this purpose, a mid-term review shall be carried&#13;
out after the first four or five tours, and a final review after the tenth tour. The reviews would involve,&#13;
among other things, interviews, questionnaires, analysis of dissemination and follow-up activities, and so forth.&#13;
(The impact on the participants' enterprises and on their sub-sectors, by contrast, could be reasonably assessed&#13;
only quite some time after the tours, however.) The evaluation would be prepared by the Tour Program&#13;
Secretariat with assistance by consultants, and reviewed and discussed by the Steering Committee and all&#13;
institutions involved, including the World Bank.&#13;
8.     Related Activities. Naturally, an increasing number of managers and government officials from&#13;
Kazakhstan have been visiting foreign countries on official and business travel. Moreover, some bilateral&#13;
donors like USAID and the German Carl Duisburg Foundation have been inviting managers for short study&#13;
tours or more extended traineeships. However, these travels are usually one-time events rather than part of&#13;
an extensive program for Kazakhstan, and they do commonly not include the kind of rigorous unified&#13;
procedures and intensive preparation, follow-up and dissemination efforts envisaged under this Project. As&#13;
to the World Bank, it envisages funding under an already existing Technical Assistance Loan ten 2-6 months&#13;
internships for managers starting in early 1995, as a way to test further, additional modes of overseas training.&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
9.     The institutional arrangements would include several elements, the details of which remain to be&#13;
determined.&#13;
(i)  A Steering Commnittee should be formed. It could comprise equal numbers (one third, respectively) of&#13;
(a) representatives from Government agencies and/or ministries, including not only the Ministry of&#13;
Economy (MOE) and possibly also a representative of the Presidential Apparatus; (b) representatives of&#13;
some business associations or unions, and (c) participants of the first two pilot study tours that took place&#13;
in June 1994. The Steering Committee would oversee the program; provide direction on the detailed&#13;
features of the program consistent with the agreements with World Bank and other donor institutions;&#13;
and help mobilize support from host country organizations and other donors. The Steering Committee&#13;
would not be directly involved in the implementation activities of the program, such as the selection of&#13;
participants.&#13;
(ii) Implementation Unit. The study tour program could be coordinated by a Tour Program Secretariat&#13;
(TPS) under Department of Training Personnel for the Market Economy, under the Ministry of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 5 of 8                                 Annex 11.2&#13;
Economy. The TPS would be responsible for the overall coordination of the program; contractual&#13;
arrangements with external consultants and trainers; the logistical arrangements of the tour travel out of&#13;
Kazakhstan; and the mid-term and ex-post evaluation of the program.&#13;
(iii) Local Training Institutions. The Kazakh Management Academy will most likely be the local training&#13;
institution contracted by the Government to organize and carry out the in-country seminars, including&#13;
marketing of study tours and the selection of candidates, and the follow-up activities. It would provide&#13;
all the physical facilities for training and accommodation of the trainees and trainers; provide at least&#13;
two highly qualified local trainers for the seminars, with prior experience in similar training carried out&#13;
by EDI; jointly with the TPS plan and advertise the training seminars and related study tours; and be&#13;
responsible jointly with the external consultants and trainers for the selection of seminar and tour&#13;
participants. The Academy will allocate two qualified staff full-time during the duration of the Project,&#13;
and will be provided with necessary office equipment under the World Bank Loan.&#13;
(iv) Host country institutions. One or several foreign host country institutions would arrange the company&#13;
visits; support the logistical arrangements within the host country; and provide experts to accompany the&#13;
tours. They could also be involved in the pre- and post-tour activities in Kazakhstan. The visited&#13;
enterprises would be expected to make high-level managers and experts available for discussions with&#13;
the study group, and in the process transfer management and operational know how to the visitors, free&#13;
of charge. It is therefore important that the host country institutions have good contacts with the&#13;
enterprises in the respective economic sub-sectors. Potential interest in participating in the tour program&#13;
has been expressed, for example, by the International Chamber of Commerce and by the European&#13;
Association of National Productivity Centers, both of which have national member organizations in many&#13;
developed countries. Some of their national organizations themselves, such as the German productivity&#13;
center (called Rationalisierungs-Kuratorium der Deutschen Wirtschaft, RKW), have also directly&#13;
expressed strong interest.&#13;
(v)  EDI. The World Bank's Economic Development Institute (EDI) would provide guidance to the seminar&#13;
activities through the provision of training materials and the provision of EDI staff as resource persons&#13;
at some or all of the seminars. EDI has also been training CIS citizens as management trainers who&#13;
could be engaged as resource persons at the seminars.&#13;
(vi) Consultants. Foreign consultants would participate as trainers in the seminars; in this context help select&#13;
the seminar and tour participants. If necessary, consultants will also help arrange the enterprise visits&#13;
overseas; accompany the tours; and potentially be involved in some of the follow-up activities after the&#13;
tours. The foreign consultants may also provide advice to the Kazakh Management Academy and TPS&#13;
in their activities. The extent of the consultants' involvement could be reduced if foreign host country&#13;
institution(s) chose to play an active role in seminar and tour activities.&#13;
E. ACTIVITIES&#13;
10.    The main activities would be the following:&#13;
(i)  Pre-Tour Seminars&#13;
Several weeks before each tour, a 7-10 days seminar will be held at a local management training&#13;
institution in Almaty. There would always be two such seminars at the same time, allowing the same&#13;
consultants/trainers to teach both seminars in parallel. To further reduce the costs of consultant/trainer&#13;
involvement, two pairs of seminars could be held back-to-back.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 6 of 8                                   Annex 11.2&#13;
The seminars would be hosted by one or two local institutions. They would provide the training&#13;
facilities; arrange (or provide in-house) accommodation and catering for the participants; assist with the&#13;
advertisement of the seminars and tours; take the lead role in selecting the seminar participants; provide&#13;
some local trainers to the seminars; and evaluate seminar participants for selecting among them the tour&#13;
participants.&#13;
Each seminar would involve two foreign consultants/trainers. Some of them could potentially be CIS&#13;
citizens who have earlier gone through the full cycle of EDI's training-of-trainers program. EDI itself&#13;
would try to provide one staff to each round of seminars.&#13;
Each seminar would have about 32 trainees from up to 16 enterprises, out of which 16, from up to 8&#13;
enterprises would then be selected for the study tours. The seminars would be conducted in Russian and&#13;
English, with interpretation provided in part by those interpreters who would subsequently accompany&#13;
the tours. The technical writers who would join and support the tours would participate in the training&#13;
seminars as well.&#13;
The pre-tour seminar would provide training in the main fields of business administration, with a focus&#13;
on the respective economic sub-sector of the participants. In the course of the seminar, the participants&#13;
would continuously improve the business development plan for their enterprise, the first outline of which&#13;
they would have submitted as part of their seminar application. The selection of the tour participants&#13;
will be based to a large extent on the quality of the business plans emerging by the end of the seminars.&#13;
During the tours, the tour participants would continuously further upgrade their business plans.&#13;
(ii) Study Tours&#13;
The study tours themselves would last for an average of 4 weeks. A tour team would visit one country,&#13;
or several neighboring countries. The enterprise visits would be for one to three days each. The&#13;
participants would meet with the host enterprise management; have extensive discussions with technical&#13;
experts of various departments of the host enterprises; visit the plants and office facilities; and possibly&#13;
also meet some of the firms' suppliers and clients to better understand the market relations within the&#13;
industry. Visits to relevant Government agencies and support institutions could also be included.&#13;
The tours would be highly structured. Every evening, the participants would meet to discuss their&#13;
findings. At various stages, the participants would produce memoranda and draft small reports. Each&#13;
participant could be assigned specific tasks during the tour, so that the team cover the entire subject&#13;
matter. At the end of the tour, the participants together would produce a comprehensive report about&#13;
their findings for dissemination to other enterprises in Kazakhstan. The technical writer accompanying&#13;
the tour would support the writing process; so would the external consultants on the tour.&#13;
(iii) Dissemination of Findings, including Post-Tour Seminars&#13;
On their return, each team would finalize substantial technical report, plus potentially shorter specialized&#13;
papers, on feasible recommended changes in their sub-sector, based on their tour experience. The writing&#13;
of these papers and sections of the technical report will be organized at the beginning of the study tours&#13;
so that each participant clearly understands what his or her individual contribution should be. The TPS&#13;
with support by the local training institutions would oversee the publication and distribution of these&#13;
reports. Team members also would give series of seminars in different regions of Kazakhstan about&#13;
their observations and conclusions to enterprises or institutions of their subsectors, with the assistance&#13;
of the TPS and potentially the local training institutions. Displays of information materials and small&#13;
product specimen collected on the tour, videos of factories visited, could enhance the seminar success.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 7 of 8                                 Annex 11.2&#13;
Participants from institutions other than enterprises might be required to agree contractually to continue&#13;
working at their institution for at least one year after the tour. Moreover, all participants would be&#13;
contractually responsible for specific post-tour activities to disseminate their findings.&#13;
(iv) Follow-up Technical Services&#13;
The TPS with support of the participating host country organizations would arrange for follow-up&#13;
services recommended by the study tour teams. Services likely to be of high value might include the&#13;
provision of translated technical materials or summaries thereof; visits to participating enterprises by host&#13;
country experts for follow-up advice; the provision of data on the operational and financial performance&#13;
(especially on labor and energy productivity, standard work loads, etc.) of average and "best practice"&#13;
enterprises in host counties, as reference points for productivity improvements in Kazakhstan; and the&#13;
establishment of a library of practical industry and trade journals. Moreover, each tour team should&#13;
meet a year after their tour for exchanging their experience in the implementation of findings. Their&#13;
cooperation during the tour might also trigger the establishment of permanent sub-sectoral structures like&#13;
specialized trade associations or research and development consortia. Some of these follow-up activities&#13;
could be funded by the Government from the World Bank Loan within the overall amount allocated to&#13;
this Loan component; some other activities would rely on host country support.&#13;
In the longer run, the provision of follow-up technical services, and indeed the implementation of the&#13;
continued tour program itself, might be provided by a Kazakhstan Productivity Center. A host country&#13;
partner institution participating in the tour program in 1995 might in fact help the Republic of&#13;
Kazakhstan eventually establish such a national center.&#13;
E. TIMING&#13;
11.    Detailed operating procedures for the study tour program have been developed and then refined in the&#13;
course of the two pilot tours of June 1994, and have again been modified to facilitate program expansion and&#13;
cost effectiveness. The revised procedures would be agreed with the World Bank upon negotiation of the&#13;
World Bank's Finance and Enterprises Development Loan. The institutional arrangements should also be&#13;
decided and finalized, and the Steering Committee and TPS appointed and established, by that time. The&#13;
selection of economic sub-sectors, and a refined timetable for tours and seminars, could be undertaken&#13;
subsequently.&#13;
12.    The procurement process for consultants and trainers could start in February 1995, so that contracts&#13;
with them can be finalized in May, 1995. The first tours could then depart in July 1995. A slightly faster&#13;
schedule could be realized through use of the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of the above-mentioned Loan&#13;
from the World Bank.&#13;
F. INPUTS AND FUNDING&#13;
13.    Foreign currency costs would include&#13;
(i)  overseas travel and subsistence expenses of tour participants, including translators and technical writers;&#13;
(ii)  fees, travel, subsistence, and sundry expenses of foreign consultants/trainers.   The foreign&#13;
consultants/trainers would spend approximately the following time on the Project: planning and&#13;
preparation of the program and the tours (4 person-months), pre-tour seminars (5 person-months), tours&#13;
(10 person-months), dissemination and other follow-up activities (4 person-months), and evaluation (2&#13;
person-months);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 8 of 8                                 Annex 11.2&#13;
(iii) host country administration expenses;&#13;
(iv) some office equipment for the TPS and local training institution(s); and&#13;
(v)  some costs of follow-up activities such as the purchase of trade journals.&#13;
14.   It is proposed that the foreign currency costs up to a maximum US$1.8 million equivalent be funded&#13;
from the World Bank's Financial and Enterprises Development Loan. This Loan has been appraised and&#13;
negotiated, and is awaiting presentation to the World Bank's Board of Directors for approval. A large part&#13;
or all of item (iii), however, should be provided by host country partner institutions. These institutions would&#13;
provide assistance in arranging the enterprise visits and host country tour planning, accompany the largest part&#13;
of the tours, and help conduct follow-up activities; they would do this free of charge as a contribution to&#13;
Kazakhstan's economic development and international business relations. Other international and bilateral&#13;
donors would be invited to fund the expansion and continuation of the tour program on a grant basis.&#13;
15.    Local currency costs would include, inter alia:&#13;
(i)  the operating expenses of the TPS, which would be borne by the Government;&#13;
(ii)  the costs incurred by the local training institutions for preparing and hosting the seminars, and for&#13;
providing some of the seminar trainers. These costs should be covered by the fees charged to the&#13;
participants. These fees, in local currency, would be set at levels that demonstrate the participants'&#13;
sincere commitment to the program, and that are affordable for them or their companies;&#13;
(iii) salaries of local translators and technical writers. It is assumed that the participation in the study tours&#13;
will be sufficiently attractive for these individuals to provide their services at moderate fees, covered by&#13;
the World Bank Loan;&#13;
(iv) local costs involved in result dissemination and follow-up services. These costs would be borne in part&#13;
by the participating enterprises, and in part by the Government.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN&#13;
FINANCIAL AND ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
"Rehabilitation Trust"&#13;
CONCEPT OUTLINE&#13;
A. OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.         As the economy's monetary constraints are hardened, the banks and the Budget are increasingly&#13;
suffering from arrears on claims on enterprises. A policy and institutional framework is being developed to&#13;
address this problem. The commercial banks need to play a key role in this effort. However, they are still&#13;
too weak in governance and capabilities to deal with all their distressed borrowers, and especially with the&#13;
largest ones. To contain the burden arising from these largest debtors, and then to force them to restructure&#13;
or to liquidate them, a Rehabilitation Trust (RT) would be established.&#13;
B. MAIN PRINCIPLES&#13;
2.         The RT would deal with those enterprises that constitute the biggest financial burden on banks,&#13;
the Budget, and suppliers. Some of these firms warrant passive restructuring (i.e., turnaround without major&#13;
new investment), and others without prospects for viability should get liquidated. The RT will force such&#13;
action by hardening the budget constraint of these up to 40 firms; it will cut them off from any inflow of funds&#13;
except through the RT. It will then make any provision of funds, or relieve from debts, conditional on&#13;
thorough restructuring and privatization, or else liquidation.&#13;
3.         If possible in view of the legal context, the creditor and owner roles will be kept separated. The&#13;
RT will control financial flows and debt restructuring, based on its review and approval of the firms'&#13;
comprehensive restructuring plans. The elaboration and actual implementation of the restructuring plans will&#13;
be the responsibility of the firms, with assistance and guidance provided by a Restructuring Advisory Unit&#13;
attached to the Ministry of Economy.&#13;
C. ENTERPRISE SELECTION AND DEBT TRANSFER&#13;
4.          Number of Firms. The RT will deal with up to 40 firms, to keep the RT manageable. The&#13;
precise figure will depend on the concentration of debt at the time of selection.&#13;
5.         Selection Criteria. The RT will deal with firms that are the biggest burdens on creditors in terms&#13;
of outstanding non-performing net liabilities to banks, enterprises, and the state's budget and extra-budget&#13;
funds. This criteria does not necessarily reflect future losses (whose estimate would require also price&#13;
assumptions) and repayment capability but it can be measured objectively and without in-depth analysis of the&#13;
enterprises. Public service enterprises like utilities or railroads, which cannot well be liquidated, will be&#13;
excluded from the RT, with potential exceptions where the distress of such an enterprise stems clearly from&#13;
inefficiency rather than from state pricing decisions.&#13;
6.          Almost all the firms meeting these criteria will likely be majority state-owned, but the RT will&#13;
also deal with privatized firms that meet the criteria and are therefore presumably too difficult to handle for&#13;
the commercial banks.&#13;
7.         Selection Decision. Data for the above criteria has been collected from the enterprises since&#13;
August 1994. Based on these criteria, a first list of 15 firms has been decided and published, whereas a&#13;
second list of 16 firms has been selected by the Ministry of Economy jointly with the inter-ministerial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Commission on Enterprise Liquidation and Turnaround, and is subject to formal confirmation by Presidential&#13;
Decree or a Government decision.&#13;
D. CONDITIONS FOR SUPPORT BY THE REHABILITATION TRUST&#13;
8.          Viability Analysis and Restructuring Plans. Each firm will first be requested to establish a&#13;
viability assessment including a restructuring proposal will be established. If the restructuring proposal is&#13;
accepted in principle by the RT a very detailed implementation plan will be produced and carried out. If, by&#13;
contrast, the firm does not produce a restructuring proposal, is found non-viable, or the restructuring plan is&#13;
rejected then a plan or liquidation/sale of assets will be produced and carried out. Preparation of the viability&#13;
assessments and restructuring plans is the responsibility of the firms and their owners (State Property&#13;
Committee, state holding companies, etc.); it is up to them to prove that the firms can become sustainably&#13;
viable and solvent through a restructuring program that is economically efficient. To support this, a&#13;
consultant-assisted Restructuring Advisory Unit is being created.  Some restructuring plans may reach&#13;
economic but not financial viability; they may still be accepted by the RT if the Government concludes detailed&#13;
long-term performance contracts for these firms, indicating the compensation for specific unprofitable&#13;
activities.&#13;
9.          The restructuring plans will be reviewed by RT staff, negotiated by RT management, and&#13;
accepted or rejected by the RT Board. Failure to present and obtain approval for a restructuring plan triggers&#13;
liquidation.&#13;
10.        Implementation Progress. Support from the RT will remain strictly tied to the implementation&#13;
of the time-phased restructuring plans. If implementation is incomplete or fails to make a firm financially&#13;
viable, the firm shall be liquidated and its assets sold. Replacement of the firm's management in the case of&#13;
minor shortfalls in restructuring progress could be a credible intermediate enforcement tool.&#13;
It.         Privatization. To improve governance and make the restructuring sustained, privatization will&#13;
generally be expected to be part of the restructuring plan, except for firms on a pre-specified list of exclusions&#13;
from privatization.&#13;
12.         Sunset Clause. Each firm must leave the RT within less than 4 years after its entry, either&#13;
through liquidation or through release into financing by banks on commercial terms. To reinforce this&#13;
constraint, the RT itself shall be terminated after 4 years. It is presumed that the banking sector will by then&#13;
be able to address on its own the problems of new large loss-makers.&#13;
13.         Liquidations. Liquidations will be initiated and driven by the RT in its role as dominant creditor.&#13;
The RT itself should play the role of liquidator. The draft revised bankruptcy law and related state enterprise&#13;
turnaround provisions need to clarify the powers of a dominant creditor like RT in liquidation. RT should,&#13;
however, use assistance by the State Property Committee (SPC) for the actual sale of company segments or&#13;
assets in the liquidation process.&#13;
E. REHABILITATION TRUST SUPPORT TO FIRMS&#13;
14.         Liquidity Support. During their analysis, planning and restructuring (or time-phased liquidation),&#13;
the RT will financially assist the firms through lines of credit. The outstanding amount of each firm's line&#13;
of credit will be compulsorily limited to 2-3 months of the production schedule agreed under the restructuring&#13;
program, according to sub-sectors. Interest arrears will automatically reduce the amount of the line. The RT&#13;
will closely supervise the firms, aimed at minimizing further losses and preventing asset dissipation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 3 of 6                              Annex III. l(a)&#13;
15.         Technical Advice. Many important elements of the restructuring plans such as the closure of&#13;
non-viable activities, disposal of non-viable and non-core assets, staff reductions, collection of the firms'&#13;
receivables, etc. will require mainly technical support. These activities will be implemented by the firms with&#13;
help by their owners and the Restructuring Advisory Unit. Privatization as part of restructuring plans would&#13;
be carried out by SPC according to the National Privatization Program.&#13;
16.         Debt Relief. The RT will provide firms with debt restructuring in line with the requirements of&#13;
the restructuring plans. The National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NBK) will restructure its&#13;
transferred central credit resources in a parallel manner. The RT could also provide relief from social&#13;
liabilities like severance pay and pensions of laid-off personnel.&#13;
17.         Relief from Social Assets. For social assets hitherto operated by the firms, the restructuring&#13;
plans prepared by the firms will indicate, with a timetable, which assets will move under the operation of the&#13;
municipalities and which will remain under operation by the firm but be financially supported by the&#13;
municipalities and/or through cost recovery from users. In cases of enterprise liquidation, social facilities will&#13;
be sold to the private sector, transferred to the municipalities or other appropriate administrations, or closed&#13;
down and liquidated. They shall not be owned by the RT for any extended period of time.&#13;
18.         Environmental Liabilities. Actual or contingent environmental liabilities of enterprises will&#13;
remain with the enterprises, or taken over together with the enterprises by investors, or assumed by the&#13;
Government (particularly in its role as enterprise owner) but not the RT. Moreover, the RT will take&#13;
environmental issues in consideration when making judgments about the viability of enterprises and when&#13;
deciding the financial support for them.&#13;
19.         New Capital Investment. The RT will not provide investment finance, except for purchases of&#13;
spare parts and minor equipment that is critical for maintaining clearly viable production lines. Investments&#13;
in substantial new assets shall instead be funded by investors and commercial banks after the passive&#13;
restructuring and release from the RT.&#13;
20.         Liquidation Support. The RT will cover the costs of an orderly liquidation program.&#13;
F. FUNDING OF THE REHABILITATION TRUST&#13;
21.         Funding Needs. Funding will be required for: (i) debt purchases; (ii) debt restructuring; (iii) the&#13;
firms' operating losses, working capital credit, severance payments, and minimal maintenance investments;&#13;
and (iv) the RT's administration.&#13;
22.         Funding Sources. The enterprise debt will be transferred to the RT together with the refinancing&#13;
of such debt from central credit resources, and together with the enterprises' deposits in the respective banks.&#13;
The initial equity capital, will be provided from the national budget. Annual cash flow deficits of the RT will&#13;
be funded, within annual ceilings, through the Ministry of Finance (MOF) from the state budget, and through&#13;
refinancing facilities provided by NBK and RT bonds, at market interest rates and guaranteed by the&#13;
Government.&#13;
G. ORGANIZATION OF THE REHABILITATION TRUST&#13;
23.         Corporate Form: The RT shall be a established as a state-owned joint stock bank with special&#13;
status.&#13;
24.         Ownership. The RT shall be owned entirely by the state, with the state (here in its role as&#13;
creditor of the enterprises) represented by the MOF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 4 of 6                             Annex 111. l(a)&#13;
25.         Governance. It is envisaged that RT Board be chaired by the Prime Minister or the First Deputy&#13;
Prime Minister overseeing economic reform, and will include minister or deputy minister level representatives&#13;
of MOE, MOF, NBK, and the President's Apparatus, and independent experts in enterprise and financial&#13;
management. Board members will be confirmed by Presidential Decree.&#13;
26.         Management.  The management will be headed by a local managing director with strong&#13;
experience in financial institutions.&#13;
27.         Incentives. Management incentives will be linked to the reduction of budgetary costs, cut of&#13;
enterprise losses, privatization or liquidation of firms, and keeping firms no longer than 3-4 years under the&#13;
RT.&#13;
28.         Staffing. The RT will have an adequate number of local professionals, with specializations in&#13;
finance, business, law, liquidations, and social security. Staff will participate in overseas secondments,&#13;
courses given by foreign experts, and on-the-job training by the RT's advisors.&#13;
29.         Assistance. A consultant team will help develop the organization, train staff off and on the job,&#13;
and supplement local staff with special expertise. The team will consist of technical advisors and, as team&#13;
leader, a senior advisor to the RT's leadership.&#13;
30.         Structure.   Small units shall be responsible for financial/economic analysis, financial&#13;
restructuring, liquidation, legal counsel, administration. Part of the RT's work will be contracted out.&#13;
31.         Decision-Making. The approval of restructuring or liquidation plans, and decisions on the&#13;
volume of financial support to the enterprises, will be decided by the RT Board. It operates within an annual&#13;
financial envelope proposed by MOF and approved by Parliament as part of the budget process.&#13;
32.         Financial Control.  Each selected firm will keep only one account, with the required sub-&#13;
accounts, in the nearest and adequately equipped branch of a commercial bank which is yet to be determined.&#13;
All financial transactions of the firms will transit through this account, and will be a priori controlled and&#13;
authorized by the RT loan officer in charge. These controls and authorizations will be based on detailed&#13;
monthly financial programming prepared by firms and agreed upon by RT management. Any shipment of&#13;
goods will be authorized only after receipt, by the RT, of a payment order or a L/C fully and irrevocably&#13;
guaranteed by a bank eligible to NBK's credit auction system and, for exports, by a foreign bank counter-&#13;
guaranteed by an eligible domestic bank. any purchases of goods or services will have to be preceded by the&#13;
issuance, by the RT, of a fully and irrevocable guarantee of the payment order issued by the firm or of a L/C.&#13;
Payment orders issued by the firm and not guaranteed by the RT will not be executed. Matured tax, financial,&#13;
and supplier obligations will be automatically deducted from the account.&#13;
G. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE REHABILITATION TRUST&#13;
33.        Institutional Setting. As a temporary institution, the RT will not develop its own network,&#13;
facilities and banking services. It will be located in the premises of one commercial bank, potentially&#13;
Turanbank, and use, under a fee-based contractual arrangement, its network and its technical facilities. The&#13;
RT will have direct access to the bank's communication and computer systems. In each branch where an&#13;
account of one of RT's clients is located, a loan officer of the designated commercial bank will be seconded&#13;
to the RT on a part-time or full-time basis. This officer will be in charge of maintaining close working&#13;
relations and communication channels with the firm, monitoring on a daily basis all its financial transactions&#13;
and reporting to the RT headquarters. The financial transactions of the firms will be performed through a&#13;
commercial bank's network and facilities, and this bank will be fully compensated by the RT for all services&#13;
provided.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 5 of 6                            Annex III.1(a)&#13;
34.        Transfer of Financial Accounts. All bank loans of the selected firms will be transferred to the&#13;
RT, together with their bank deposits and the centralized credit resources to refinance the loans. The float&#13;
(payment orders issued and received by a firm but not paid) will continue to be managed under the previous&#13;
accounts of the firm for 90 days, and the net situation at the end of this period will be transferred to the RT.&#13;
If these transfers of resources are lower than the transfers of liabilities, banks will be allowed to transfer to&#13;
the RT additional non-earmarked central credit resources up to the amount of this gap. These mandatory&#13;
transfers will be effected in appropriate legal contractual forms between the banks and firms involved, NBK&#13;
and the RT in order for the validity of existing claims to be retained. Central credit resources transferred to&#13;
the RT will be guaranteed by the Government.&#13;
35.        Legal Basis. A Presidential Decree will outline the RT's legal status, supervisory organs,&#13;
authority, responsibilities, principles, etc. A detailed RT Statute will elaborate the RT's organization, Board,&#13;
management, etc.&#13;
36.        The draft revised Bankruptcy Law and the draft Regulation on Turnaround and Bankruptcy of&#13;
State Enterprises (for streamlined processing) shall provide the necessary powers for liquidation and&#13;
restructuring, but the latter draft needs improvements to be workable and to give the RT sufficient powers for&#13;
liquidation/sale of assets.&#13;
37.        World Bank Support. The Bank's Technical Assistance Loan is supporting an ongoing consultant&#13;
assignment to help further plan and establish the RT, envisaged to be completed by about June 1995. The&#13;
Bank's proposed Financial and Enterprises Development Loan would help fund long-term advisors who would&#13;
assist the further institution building (training, info system, policy advice) and operations (assessing&#13;
restructuring plans; developing financial engineering options; first liquidations, etc.). The national budget that&#13;
would provide the main funding for the RT is expected to receive support under a proposed Economic Reform&#13;
Loan.&#13;
38.        Donor Coordination. The European Bank (EBRD) is funding a current study on banks' internal&#13;
work-out units and on a turnaround fund for very promising yet financially distressed small and medium&#13;
enterprises, and plans supporting both kind of institutions through a loan. This target group of enterprises&#13;
differs from that of the RT, and the initiative is hence complementary.&#13;
H. NECESSARY MACROECONOMIC AND STRUCTURAL CONTEXT&#13;
39.        Macroeconomic Context: Kazakhstan is under a standby arrangement with the IMF whose Board&#13;
has agreed in late August, 1994, to a revision of that standby. The first quarter targets may have been met;&#13;
an IMF mission is currently in the field to review the progress and discuss new targets for the rest of the year.&#13;
Inflation objectives may need to be relaxed in view of a recent arrears clearing exercise. The RT will support&#13;
stabilization by forcing the restructuring or liquidation of the largest debtors, thus following up with on the&#13;
clearing exercise with concrete restructuring action.&#13;
40.        Liberalization. In the context of the Bank's Rehabilitation Loan, Kazakhstan has made good&#13;
progress on price and trade liberalization, but less on ensuring competition. Continued progress will further&#13;
ensure that meaningful signals guide the restructuring, and that the constraints of firms are not softened&#13;
through major subsidies, protection, or monopolization.&#13;
41.        Enterprise Governance. Discipline shall be imposed on the firms by their creditors as well as&#13;
their owners. The main tool to enhance governance is privatization, which has made good progress with the&#13;
current national roll-out of all tracks of the National Privatization Program. In general, firms shall be&#13;
privatized before restructuring; if they are not sellable without some prior restructuring (like presumably in&#13;
the case of the RT's firms) then privatization shall be part of restructuring plans. The governance of firms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 6 of 6                           Annex Ill. l(a)&#13;
prior to privatization, which is at present exercised by SPC and its state holding companies, will be enhanced&#13;
in 1995 with technical assistance by the Bank.&#13;
42.        Financial Sector Reform. A comprehensive reform program for the financial sector is being&#13;
developed by NBK with collaboration by other agencies and with assistance by the World Bank. The RT&#13;
mechanism is to some extent independent of these comprehensive reforms. However, they shall avoid re-&#13;
occurrence of arrear and liquidity problems of the current magnitude, and enhance the banks' capability to&#13;
eventually handle even very large distressed enterprises on their own. A legal and institutional framework&#13;
for government securities, including Government-guaranteed bonds that might be used to fund the RT&#13;
program, is being developed with assistance by the IMF and USAID.&#13;
43.        Legal Framework. In the last 15 months, Kazakhstan issued new laws on banking and central&#13;
bank, and regulations on central credit resources, bank supervision, bank governance, securities, etc. A&#13;
Commercial Code with comprehensive contract law provisions is being drafted. Draft legislation and&#13;
amendments on collateral, bankruptcy, state enterprise turnaround, which are critical to the RT, as well as on&#13;
banking, securities, and several financial instruments, are expected to be introduced in early 1995, i.e., prior&#13;
to the start of RT operations. The draft provision on state enterprise turnaround and bankruptcy needs to be&#13;
strengthened, and the further changes of the draft Bankruptcy Law kept on a sound course, to ensure a&#13;
conducive framework that allows the RT to enforce restructuring and undertake liquidations without&#13;
involvement of the courts while the relevant capabilities of the latter are gradually developing.&#13;

DRAFT SUMMARY TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.       One of the central objective of the reform policy of Kazakhstan is to develop a sound and efficient&#13;
banking system that will be in charge of playing a key role in the adjustment of the enterprise sector through&#13;
the enforcement of stronger financial discipline on individual firms, the work-out of their non performing&#13;
liabilities and the allocation of their financial resources based on the creditworthiness of their potential&#13;
borrowers.&#13;
2.       The economic and financial restructuring of the public enterprises with the largest arrears to banks,&#13;
suppliers, employees and the Budget cannot, however, be led and supported by existing banking institutions,&#13;
given the magnitude of their problems, the social dimension of their situation, and the amount of human and&#13;
financial resources required to restructure them.&#13;
3.      In this context, the authorities have decided to isolate up to 40 enterprises with largest arrears from&#13;
the rest of the banking sector and to create a Rehabilitation Trust that will be in charge of: (i) taking over the&#13;
risk exposure of the banking sector on these enterprises; (ii) enforcing a hard budget constraint on them&#13;
through a tight control of their finances; and (iii) financing their deficits based on the implementation of&#13;
restructuring programs aimed at restoring the financial condition of viable ones and at liquidating the non-&#13;
viable ones. A detailed concept note for this Rehabilitation Trust is attached to these terms of reference.&#13;
4.       The preparatory work required for this institution to be fully operational during the second quarter&#13;
of 1995 is being implemented by the authorities with the assistance of external consultants funded under a&#13;
Technical Assistance Loan provided by the World Bank. These consultants are advising on the legal&#13;
documents, structure, processes, information system, etc. of the emerging institution.&#13;
B. OBJECTIVES&#13;
5.       The objectives of the proposed assignment are to: (i) finalize the detailed arrangements required for&#13;
the institution to be fully operational and (ii) assist the management of the Rehabilitation Trust in performing&#13;
its tasks in an efficient manner.&#13;
6.       In a first step, the Consultant will review in detail the preparatory work already achieved in order&#13;
to confirm, or, when required, propose to amend, the feasibility of the retained scheme. This review will&#13;
include the preparation of the concrete steps necessary for the Bank to be fully operational as soon as possible.&#13;
7.       In a second step, the Consultant will provide: (i) the managerial assistance required for the Bank&#13;
to be a financially and institutionally strong institution; and (ii) the technical assistance required to assess the&#13;
restructuring programs proposed by the enterprises, design on this basis the conditionality and the structure&#13;
of the financial support that could be provided by the Bank, closely monitor developments in the situation of&#13;
the firms and take remedial actions when required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

C. ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
8.       This assignment will be carried out by a specialized consulting firm or financial institution having&#13;
high credentials, a long experience in the financial and technical issues to be covered, and a good knowledge&#13;
of the specific situation of economies in transition, in particular in CIS countries.&#13;
D. COUNTERPART AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
9.       The consultants will work directly with the staff of the Rehabilitation Trust. Responsible for the&#13;
implementation of this assistance under the World Bank loan is Project Implementation Unit at the Ministry&#13;
of Economy (currently at the National Agency for Foreign Investment, under MOE).  This Project&#13;
Implementation Unit will assist procurement, disbursements, and related matters under this component of the&#13;
World Bank's Financial and Enterprises Development Project that is envisaged to finance the assistance.&#13;
10.      This assignment is expected to start in about May 1995 and to end in about November 1997. The&#13;
first step of the study is anticipated to be carried out in three months. In its proposal, the Consultant will&#13;
present a detailed timetable for the tasks to be performed within this time frame that will be agreed upon&#13;
during the negotiation of the contract.&#13;
E. ACTIVITIES AND OUTPUTS&#13;
11.      The Consultant will provide a team of experienced experts who will work full time in the Bank,&#13;
the possibility to send specialists on short term assignments to review the technical aspects of restructuring&#13;
programs, and a quality assessment and technical back-up from headquarters.&#13;
12.      The core team of permanent experts will consist of three persons:&#13;
(i)    a project manager, who will be the deputy or the personal advisor of the chief executive officer of the&#13;
Bank. He will be in charge of providing policy and operational advice for the overall management&#13;
of the bank, assisting in the implementation and the supervision of all procedures required for the&#13;
functioning of the bank, and preparing or reviewing documents presented to its decision making&#13;
bodies. He will participate in the executive committee of the Bank.&#13;
(ii)    a financial specialist, who will be the deputy or the personal advisor of the financial director of the&#13;
Bank. He will be in charge of providing advice for the financial management of the institution and&#13;
the structuring, including their legal aspects, of its financial facilities, reviewing the financial aspects&#13;
of the restructuring programs presented by the enterprises, and setting up and supervising the&#13;
procedures required for the delivery of the financial support to be provided by the Bank and for the&#13;
monitoring of enterprises' financial developments.&#13;
(iii)   an industrial specialist, who will be the deputy or the personal advisor of the technical director of the&#13;
bank. He will be in charge of reviewing the technical components of the restructuring programs and&#13;
of monitoring their implementation.&#13;
13.      The consultants would work directly with the staff and management of the Rehabilitation Trust and&#13;
advise them in all policy, legal, institutional, financial, and operational matters directly relating to the&#13;
Rehabilitation Trust and its work. The envisaged institutional set-up, financing mechanisms, and operational&#13;
procedures are outlined in the attached concept note.&#13;

1.      For each Kazakh bank, the twinned foreign bank or consultant (hereafter referred to as the&#13;
"Consultant" even if it is a bank) selected to deliver technical assistance will utilize the diagnostic study report&#13;
and on-site discussions with management in order to prepare an institutional development program tailored&#13;
to that bank's particular strategy, needs, and resources. The Consultant will generally act in an advisory&#13;
capacity during the implementation phase of the program, although line responsibilities may be requested in&#13;
some critical areas. Training of counterpart and other staff, particularly in new banking processes that are&#13;
developed, will form an important part of the Consultant's duties. All plans assume significant involvement&#13;
of Kazakh bank staff in order to promote skills transfer, minimize the cost of foreign consultants, and to&#13;
ensure that the program remains consistent with the environment and strategy of the bank. The Consultant&#13;
should arrange for, and will be responsible for, all the service required by the Kazakh bank under this&#13;
program. Limited sub-contracting arrangements are allowed under terms of the contract, but services for&#13;
which this option is to be employed must be specified in the Consultant's proposal and contract documentation.&#13;
2.      The institutional development programs will be structured in nine "modules" corresponding to basic&#13;
functional areas of banking: (a) strategy; (b) organizational structure and procedures; (c) planing, budgeting,&#13;
and financial control; (d) credit management; (e) financial management; (f) marketing; (g) branch management;&#13;
(h) human resources and training management; and (i) technology. However, not all participating banks will&#13;
pursue or require assistance in all nine modules. The detailed content, prioritization and timetable of each&#13;
module will be individually developed to take account of each bank's particular strategy, needs, and resources&#13;
as indicated by the results of the diagnostic studies.&#13;
(a) Strategy&#13;
3.      In the strategy area, the Consultant will: (i) refine and expand the bank's business planning process&#13;
to cover all important areas of strategic analysis and decision; (ii) train the bank's management in its use; (iii)&#13;
work with the bank's management to develop an operational strategic plan for the bank, and a concrete&#13;
program for its implementation; and (iv) work with line managers to translate the strategic plan into specific&#13;
plans and goals for each major area of the bank.&#13;
4.       This module will include a market analysis and a profitability analysis of customers, products, and&#13;
units, and a definition of the bank's mission, goals, basic strategies, target markets, products and services,&#13;
resource requirements, and action programs covering both corporate and retail banking.&#13;
(b) Organizational Structure and Procedures&#13;
5.      The Consultant will work with management to: (i) assess the existing organization structure of the&#13;
head office and of a sample of branches; (ii) plan a new organization structure for the head office focused on&#13;
successfully executing the strategic plan and making the structure more market-oriented; (iii) plan a new&#13;
organization structure for branches that will be tested before finalizing the model that will be used for all&#13;
branches; (iv) identify the required staffing levels and the main skill requirements in each organization unit;&#13;
(v) assess the general procedures of the bank, and propose required changes both at each unit level and for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 2 of 6                            Annex III.2(a)&#13;
the relation between these units; (vi) prepare a concrete plan for implementing the new structures and&#13;
procedures.&#13;
6.      In defining new organization units, the Consultant will provide sufficient detail about each unit and&#13;
the relations between them, for the bank to be in a position to successfully implement it -- e.g., the unit's basic&#13;
mission, main responsibilities, and key functions for carrying out each responsibility, control system, and&#13;
procedures, as well as the required staffing levels and main skill requirements as noted above.&#13;
(c) Planning, Budgeting. and Financial Control&#13;
7.       The Consultant will develop with the bank management: (i) a revolving planning and budgeting&#13;
process based on a simple projection tool of the balance sheet, flow of funds, and income statement of the&#13;
bank that will include details required to prepare annual budgets at both centralized and decentralized levels;&#13;
(ii) budget procedures and control mechanisms; (iii) the minimum analytical tools required to follow, on a&#13;
monthly basis, the results of the bank and to initiate the development of cost-accounting techniques to be used&#13;
for monitoring the performance of the bank's profits centers.&#13;
8.       The Consultant will also help the bank to conceive the different internal control mechanisms that&#13;
are required for the management to have an overall accurate assessment of the situation of the bank. In this&#13;
context, the flow of information between the different units of the bank will be organized in order to be easily&#13;
consolidated in a coherent reporting system.&#13;
(d) Credit Management&#13;
9.       The Consultant will: (i) assess the bank's existing credit policies, processes, organization and skills -&#13;
- covering domestic and hard currency lending, enterprise and individual lending, and project finance, from&#13;
origination through analysis, approval structuring, pricing, collateral policies, disbursement procedures,&#13;
administration, monitoring, classification, provisioning and problem loan management -- in the context of the&#13;
credit requirements of the strategic plan and good credit management practice; (ii) identify areas that need to&#13;
be improved or developed; (iii) work with management to make those improvements with the objective to&#13;
build a fully effective credit management system; (iv) document the new policies and procedures in a credit&#13;
manual; (v) train a core staff in utilization of the new or modified processes; (vi) identify the additional skill&#13;
development needed by the bank to effectively execute and sustain the system; and (vii) identify the automation&#13;
requirements of the new credit management system. In this context, the Consultants will also familiarize staff&#13;
of the local bank with appropriate environmental due diligence procedures.&#13;
(e) Financial Management&#13;
10.     The Consultant will: (i) assess the full scope of the bank's financial management processes,&#13;
organization and skills, and identify needed improvements; (ii) work with management to make needed&#13;
improvements in priority areas -- which, at this point, are anticipated to include the accounting system,&#13;
financial reporting, management information, asset/liability management, liquidity management, and treasury&#13;
operations; (iii) train a core financial staff in utilization of new or modified processes; (iv) identify additional&#13;
skill development needed by the bank to effectively execute and sustain the system; and (v) identify the&#13;
automation requirements of the new financial management system.&#13;
(f) Marketing&#13;
11.     In conjunction with the strategic planning module, the Consultant will work with the bank's&#13;
management to: (i) prepare a concrete marketing plan for the bank and its main businesses, recognizing the&#13;
different needs of corporate and retail banking; (ii) specify the organization and other resources needed for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 3 of 6                             Annex III.2(a)&#13;
executing the plan; (iii) develop key marketing techniques to be used by the bank in each business area; and&#13;
(iv) identify the skills needed by the bank to sustain a successful marketing program. The Consultant is&#13;
expected to transfer skills of market analysis and market planning to the bank during this work, and to&#13;
generate a formalized market planning and development process.&#13;
(g) Branch Management&#13;
12.     In this area, the Consultant will: (i) review the current system of managing branches, and identify&#13;
needed improvements, particularly in control and risk management; (ii) review the process of planning the&#13;
branch network and identify needed improvements; (iii) select, with management, a "typical" branch, redesign&#13;
its work flows, organization, staffing, physical layout, equipment, quality standards for operations and&#13;
customer service, and other major operating elements so that is can serve as a model for all other similar&#13;
branches in the network; (iv) plan the development of a computer system for assembling branch asset and&#13;
liability data on a real-time basis; and (v) prepare a plan for developing a cost-accounting system at the branch&#13;
level and for improving head office/branch communications.&#13;
(h) Human Resources and Training Management&#13;
13.      The Consultant will work with management to build an effective human resource management&#13;
system, refining existing human resources processes such as recruiting, remuneration and incentives, and&#13;
building or improving human resources processes such as performance/potential appraisal, individual&#13;
development planning, transfer and promotion, and succession planning. the Consultant will also train a core&#13;
human resources staff in the utilization of new or modified processes and identify any additional skill&#13;
development needed for an effective ongoing human resources management function.&#13;
14.      During the course of the project, the Consultant will also: (i) assess the organizational culture; (ii)&#13;
identify major aspects of the culture that require change in order for the bank to successfully operate in a&#13;
commercial, competitive and market-oriented mode; and (iii) define the actions needed to achieve these&#13;
changes.&#13;
15.      After the new organization structure is defined, the Consultant will work with training staff to: (i)&#13;
conduct a training needs analysis of key jobs in all units; (ii) prioritize training needs, with a view towards&#13;
the required integration of training with the business plan, and organize them into a training master plan that&#13;
meets priority training needs within the required time period and budget constraint; (iii) reassess the training&#13;
tools presently used; and (iv) make needed improvements in areas such as planning external and internal&#13;
training activities, methodologies for training course development and delivery, training materials,&#13;
identification and evaluation of external training facilities, selecting and preparing trainers and trainees, and&#13;
training evaluation.&#13;
16.      As noted in the above sections, the Consultant is expected to train managers and core staff in all&#13;
new banking processes developed or modified during the project. The scope and type of training is to be&#13;
determined between the Consultant and bank management, based on the relative advantage of the Consultant&#13;
providing such training compared with other potential providers. The following methods will be utilized for&#13;
delivering training: (i) "on-the-job" training for the bank's managerial staff who are working with the&#13;
Consultant; (ii) training of core functional staff in utilization of new or modified processes developed by the&#13;
Consultant in each module of work; and (iii) additional training of managers and professionals in high priority&#13;
areas as decided between the Bank management and the Consultant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 4 of 6                            Annex 111.2(a)&#13;
(i) Technolojv&#13;
17.     In this area, the priority for the Consultant will be to clearly define user requirements and refine&#13;
the bank's automation program in the context of the bank's overall strategic plan, to ensure the most cost-&#13;
effective implementation.&#13;
18.     The Consultant may need to achieve this goal through several stages: (i) evaluating the bank's&#13;
existing hardware architecture and systems engineering and its near-term automation program in the context&#13;
of the new strategic plan; (ii) working with management and its consultants to refine and update the program;&#13;
and (iii) continuing to update the program as new banking processes are developed. In addition, the&#13;
Consultant will identify priority needs for development of core technology skills and technology management&#13;
processes, and for the efficient use of the information system by the bank's staff and management.&#13;
19.     It should be noted that each bank under the institutional strengthening program will, in addition to&#13;
the consultancy under these terms of references, have access to funding for information technology under the&#13;
same World Bank Loan.&#13;
B. REPORTING&#13;
20.     At a minimum, the technical assistance contractors will prepare, and review with the management&#13;
of participating banks, the following:&#13;
* Within two months of commencing work, a detailed, updated work plan, including the proposed level&#13;
of effort (work-weeks/months) and scheduled outputs;&#13;
* monthly financial reports providing information on a number of key financial parameters [format will&#13;
be given at negotiations];&#13;
* quarterly progress reports documenting findings, conclusions, recommendations, end-products, issues&#13;
and proposed next steps.&#13;
21.     Specific reporting requirements, including contract budget and implementation progress measurement&#13;
criteria, will be agreed between the participating banks and the contractor during contract negotiations.&#13;
22.     The two-month updated work plan and all subsequent monthly and quarterly reports will be&#13;
submitted to the project implementation unit at the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NBK). It&#13;
is the responsibility of the consultant to ensure that these are received within two weeks subsequent to the end&#13;
of the month/quarter, regardless of the status of discussions with management.&#13;
23.     Participating banks will also be required to prepare semi-annual evaluations of the program and&#13;
submit these to the project implementation unit at NBK.&#13;
C. COST ESTIMATES AND BUDGET&#13;
24.     Each institutional development program will be designed and negotiated to meet the particular needs&#13;
of the participating bank which it is intended to serve. No two programs will be identical. However, most&#13;
participating banks will adopt programs requiring consultant inputs in the nine functional modules as outlined&#13;
below.&#13;

25.      Based on a preliminary assessment of the situation and needs of pre-selected banks that will be&#13;
fiurther analyzed during the comprehensive diagnostic process, the costs of these programs (not including&#13;
automation equipment) should be around US$2.5 million for the largest banks and about US$1.5 million for&#13;
a medium-sized bank. The total costs of the four programs is estimated at no more than 8 million. (This&#13;
figure does not include the provision of bank information technology to the same local banks under the same&#13;
World Bank Loan.)&#13;
26.      At a minimum, the following results will be obtained during the first year of the project:&#13;
* Development and initial implementation of the strategic plan;&#13;
* development and implementation of the organization structure and key procedures;&#13;
* development and implementation of the planning and budgeting process;&#13;
* implementation of key elements of the credit management system, particularly those focused on risk&#13;
management and problem loans management;&#13;
* implementation of key elements of the financial management system, particularly those focused on&#13;
liquidity management, risk assessment, and overall profitability;&#13;
* development and initial implementation of the marketing plan;&#13;
* implementation of key human resources management systems, particularly those related to recruiting,&#13;
remuneration, incentives, appraisal, and development;&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN&#13;
FINANCIAL AND ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
COMMERCIAL BANKING DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT&#13;
CONDITIONS FOR PARTICIPATION OF LOCAL AND FOREIGN BANKS&#13;
1.    Many banks in Kazakhstan have expressed an interest in: (i) developing financial, business and&#13;
institutional relations with foreign banks integrated in international capital markets; and (ii) strengthening their&#13;
operational procedures through an access to professional advice from banking professionals practicing in&#13;
advanced market economies. Some banks have started to open correspondent accounts with western banks&#13;
and to benefit from short term training facilities offered by such institutions. Most banks consider, however,&#13;
that they need stronger institutional relations with experienced foreign partners to rapidly overcome their main&#13;
institutional weaknesses and to operate successfully in a market oriented economy. Their first attempts to&#13;
attract foreign banks as minority shareholders and to develop joint-venture affiliates did generally not&#13;
materialize. This shows that the local economic, financial and legal environment is still considered too&#13;
unstable to develop such close relations on their own.&#13;
2.    Experience indicates that twinning arrangements are the most efficient and cost effective way to&#13;
successfully develop comprehensive, long-term institutional development programs. NBK and the banks that&#13;
have been identified by the World Bank as potential candidates have expressed a strong interest in such&#13;
arrangements. The main objective of such programs is to help local banks to develop strong and sustained&#13;
bilateral relations with a foreign partner that would facilitate the development of their international relations&#13;
and would provide them with a comprehensive technical assistance and institutional development program and&#13;
with the opportunity to benefit from a direct transfer of know-how, products, procedures and systems. They&#13;
would also bring partner banks a diversification of their non interest income and an opportunity to develop&#13;
their knowledge of the local economy.&#13;
3.    Most important conditions for such arrangements to be successful are: (i) for both partners to have&#13;
consistent profiles and a strong commitment to build a long term partnership; (ii) for the local banks to have&#13;
a full autonomy and a strong governance together with a sufficient size and capital base, an acceptable&#13;
financial condition, reasonably good prospects, as well as clear objectives and an adequate absorption capacity;&#13;
and (iii) for the foreign banks to have an international culture, a first hand knowledge of transitional economy&#13;
and an interest to develop a long term relationship with Kazakhstan, a size and an international organization&#13;
consistent with the flexibility and the secondment of staff required by such contracts, as well as adequate class&#13;
and on-the-job training facilities.&#13;
A. THE SELECTION PROCESS OF LOCAL PARTICIPATING BANKS&#13;
4.    Two large commercial banks still controlled by the Government have first been tentatively preselected&#13;
based on: (i) their importance to the domestic economy; (ii) the role they should continue to play in the&#13;
provision of banking services in Kazakhstan, in particular to its low income population located in remote&#13;
areas; (iii) the weakness of their present organization and procedures and their willingness to engage in&#13;
restructuring programs to consolidate their situation; and (iv) their desire to build long term relations with&#13;
reputable foreign partners engaged in the same kind of activities. They are: (i) Agroprombank, which is&#13;
specialized in the provision of financial services to the agricultural and agro-processing sectors, that play a&#13;
key role in the Kazakh economy; and (ii) the People's Bank, which is the former State Savings Bank that has&#13;
been recently transformed into a common universal joint-stock bank and lost most of its privileges. Both face&#13;
severe institutional and technological weaknesses and, at least in the case of Agroprombank, a distressed&#13;
financial condition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 2 of 6                              Annex 111.2(b)&#13;
5.     The other participating banks will be two medium-sized emerging private sector banks that will be&#13;
selected through a three-phased screening process. This small number is explained by the fact that the size&#13;
and the equity base of most new private banks are still too small and their condition too fragile for such&#13;
twinning arrangements to be feasible. Indeed, it is expected that, with the on-going rationalization of the&#13;
monetary policy and the progressive reinforcement of prudential standards, about half of them will rapidly&#13;
disappear through closures, liquidations and mergers.&#13;
6.     The first phase of the selection process consisted of a tentative screening of the existing around 200&#13;
banks' balance sheets data as of end April 1994, as reported to the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK).&#13;
Criteria used were the size of their capital and of their assets, the distribution of their ownership, the level of&#13;
their capital adequacy ratio before provisioning, their liquidity position, their focus on the private sector and&#13;
the structure of their liabilities. Five banks emerged from this process, three having met the pre-selection&#13;
criteria and two being in a position to meet them soon through pending increases in their paid-in capital. One&#13;
has been eliminated due to its easy access to, and already close relations with, a reputable international bank.&#13;
Other preselected banks have expressed a strong interest in the proposed twinning arrangements with foreign&#13;
banks and confirmed their desire to rapidly meet international standards for both their financial condition and&#13;
their banking practices.&#13;
7.     The second phase consists of comprehensive financial and institutional diagnostic studies of all&#13;
preselected banks, including Agroprombank and the People's Bank, conducted by international auditing firms.&#13;
These detailed studies have been carried out starting August 1994, and the first preliminary reports have been&#13;
submitted since January 1995. These studies aim at: (i) confirming that preselected banks meet, or are in a&#13;
position to meet in less than one year, the pre-selection criteria, (ii) assessing in detail their financial,&#13;
institutional and technological condition, and (iii) designing, with their management, a time-framed institutional&#13;
and automation development plan.&#13;
8.     The third phase will consist of the accreditation of all selected banks. Banks participating in the&#13;
program will be required, in order to be accredited, to: (i) maintain compliance with five prudential standards,&#13;
that are presented in Box 1 below, and with all requirements issued by NBK, with the temporary exception&#13;
of Agroprombank; (ii) commit themselves to implement an institutional and automation development plan and&#13;
to be annually audited according with generally accepted international accounting standards; (iii) demonstrate&#13;
a genuine managerial autonomy and maintain adequate accounting and reporting standards, as well as&#13;
acceptable financial, organizational and efficiency performance standards, that are presented in Box 2 below;&#13;
and (iv) implement active and sound banking policies, with a focus on the emerging private sector, in both&#13;
their resource mobilization and their lending activities.&#13;
9.     The accreditation will be given by NBK and conditioned by its prior receipt of a "no objection" notice&#13;
from the World Bank. Banks that will comply with most, but not all, important accreditation criteria will still&#13;
be able to participate in the program if they present a detailed and timely monitorable action program aimed&#13;
at redressing their situation that is acceptable to both NBK and the World Bank. The same procedure will be&#13;
used in case a participating bank drops out of compliance during the implementation of the program.&#13;
&#13;

BOX 1&#13;
PROPOSED PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR PARTICIPATING LOCAL BANKS&#13;
All participating local banks will have to agree to maintain compliance with five prudential standards related to: (i) their&#13;
capital to weighted assets ratio, (ii) their liquidity position, (iii) the level and the concentration of their exposure to single&#13;
and to connected parties, (iv) their foreign exchange exposure, and (v) the classification of their risk assets portfolios and&#13;
their level of provisions.&#13;
NBK has already introduced, and recently upgraded, prudential regulations covering the first four standards. Compliance&#13;
with the first two ones conditions banks' access to NBK credit auction market. NBK is meanwhile requiring compliance&#13;
with the first four ones for banks to access the auction market. Data related to the level and the concentration of single&#13;
and aggregated, large or connected, exposure are however only gradually becoming available for a sufficient number of&#13;
banks to assess the feasibility of this objective, since the related prudential regulation were introduced only in the second&#13;
quarter of 1994. NBK is also currently preparing the loan classification methodology that will have to be used by all&#13;
banks. Based on the results of the analysis of the loan portfolios and the assessment of the financial condition that are&#13;
included in the forthcoming diagnostic studies, NBK expects also to be in a position to introduce a regulation regarding&#13;
provisioning requirements, in a realistic and phased-in manner in the first half of 1995.&#13;
The compliance with prudential standards that will be required from participating banks are expected to be the following:&#13;
CAPITAL ADEQUACY&#13;
Assessed as the ratio of equity capital to risk weighted assets, the minimum capital adequacy ratio will be 4 percent by end&#13;
1994 and will be increased by one percentage point each following year up to 8 percent by end 1998. The weights will be&#13;
those presently used by NBK, as they are almost entirely in line with usual international standards.&#13;
LIQUIDITY RATIO&#13;
Assessed as the ratio of highly liquid assets to total liabilities, it will have to be maintained above 30 percent. This ratio&#13;
could however be replaced by a more significant one when participating banks will have developed the required&#13;
information system, as long as the new ratio is acceptable to the World Bank.&#13;
LEVEL AND CONCENTRATION OF LARGE AND CONNECTED EXPOSURE&#13;
The recently introduced prudential regulation related to the single and aggregated ceilings on large and on connected&#13;
exposure is in line with usual international practice. However, it will very probably have to be phased in a realistic&#13;
manner over the medium term. The annual ceilings that will be retained for this project will be determined based on the&#13;
preliminary results of the diagnostic studies that are being received at present.&#13;
FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE&#13;
Participating banks will have to limit their open position in any single foreign currency to a maximum of 15 percent of&#13;
their capital and the total of them to a maximum of 30 percent of their capital, as in line with the prudential regulation&#13;
recently introduced by NBK.&#13;
CLASSIFICATION OF RISK ASSETS AND LEVEL OF PROVISIONS&#13;
If acceptable to the World Bank, the classification of risk assets of participating banks will be the same one as the one that&#13;
will be introduced by NBK in the forthcoming months. bIdeed, it is expected to be a simplified version of usually accepted&#13;
international standards and to be identical to the one that will be used by international auditors in their forthcoming&#13;
assessment of the loan portfolio of the ten largest banks of Kazakbstan. The level of provisioning will be determined based&#13;
on the results on the diagnostic studies whose prelitninary versions are being received at present.&#13;
All participating banks will have to comply with the minima that will be finally retained for the project, with the exception&#13;
of Agroprombank. Its minima will be determined based on the results of its financial diagnostic and on the restructuring&#13;
plan that will serve as the basis of its overall development program.&#13;

Box 2&#13;
PROPOSED INTERNAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS&#13;
FOR PARTICIPATING LOCAL BANKS&#13;
All participating local banks wiU be required to keep complying with internal performance standards related to: (i) their&#13;
management effectiveness, (ii) accounting and reporting standards; (iii) development and efficiency targets; (iv) financial&#13;
management and profitability.&#13;
MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS&#13;
Standards related to their management effectiveness will be based on the managerial autonomy of the bank, the adequacy of&#13;
boards' guidance and surveillance and of internal control systems, the soundness of internal policies and procedures and&#13;
their actual implementation, and the quality of the planning and budgeting processes.&#13;
ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING SYSTEMS&#13;
Banks' accounting and reporting standards will be required to follow generally accepted international ones with the&#13;
objective of giving a fair and true image of their conditions. Annual, quarterly and monthly reports will be based on the&#13;
ones required by NBK, that will be further developed with the introduction of a new chart of accounts, and will be&#13;
complemented by supplementary information if required.&#13;
DEVELOPMENT AND EFFICIENCY&#13;
Each bank will develop a set of quantitative performance target that will be used to monitor its development and the&#13;
improvement of its efficiency.  These targets will cover the structure of its assets and its liabilities, its market shares in its&#13;
core business activities, as well as usual productivity and efficiency measures of capital and human resources.&#13;
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND PROFITABILITY&#13;
Financial management and profitability performance standards will cover the adequacy of the asset-liability management&#13;
system, with an emphasis on the assessment and management of financial risks and of financial independence and the&#13;
monitoring of net income developments in relation to earning assets, profit centers and equity.&#13;
The terms of reference of annual external audit will include an assessment of recent developments and of required future&#13;
progress in these four areas. The updating of annual internal performance standards will be based, if required, on the&#13;
results of these external audits. The overall objective of the development programs of each bank will be to reach sound&#13;
banking practices, as usually defined by external auditors, by the end of the twinning arrangements.&#13;
B. THE SELECTION PROCESS OF FOREIGN PARTNER BANKS&#13;
10.    A number of foreign banks have already expressed an interest to enter into twinning arrangements with&#13;
Kazakh banks. A more systematic identification of such potential partners will be launched over the next two&#13;
months, jointly by NBK and the World Bank, taking into account the different profiles of preselected local&#13;
banks and indications related to the trade financing activities already developed with Kazakhstan by some&#13;
international banks. Initial contacts between foreign and local banks will be initiated when the preliminary&#13;
results of the diagnostic studies are available and have been reviewed and discussed. Preconditions required&#13;
for a foreign bank to be included in the list of institutions that will be invited to submit a proposal will be a&#13;
strong track record, a sound financial condition and reputable banking practices, long experience in activities&#13;
to be developed by local banks, an opening in international relations, adequate training facilities, and&#13;
experience of transitional economies. The selection of these banks will be made according to the usual World&#13;
Bank procurement procedures, with a ceiling of 25 percent on the amount of services that would be&#13;
subcontracted to external individual consultants or consulting firms. The final decision for the selection of&#13;
foreign partners will be made by each local bank, with the assistance of an evaluation committee set up by&#13;
NBK.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 5 of 6                           Annex 111.2(b)&#13;
C. THE DESIGN OF THE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS&#13;
11.   The institutional strengthening program for each bank participating in the Banking Development&#13;
Component of the project will be implemented with the assistance of its partner foreign bank. This assistance&#13;
will be provided in the framework of a contract negotiated between each domestic bank and its foreign partner.&#13;
Typically, these contracts will define the relations between the two parties, describe services to be provided&#13;
by the foreign bank and the modalities of their delivery, include the composition of the foreign bank team and&#13;
of the local bank counterpart team and set the remuneration and payment agreement, and the reporting and&#13;
performance review process. Each program will be tailored to the needs of each participating bank on the basis&#13;
of the conclusions of the institutional component of the diagnostic studies. These programs will be structured&#13;
in different modules corresponding to the core activities of each bank. Activities to be developed under each&#13;
module will be incorporated in a Master Plan, detailed in concrete steps and time framed. This Master Plan&#13;
will be updated semi-annually jointly by twinned banks. Draft terms of reference for these institutional&#13;
development programs, which present a typical example of the content of the different modules that will&#13;
compose a program, are shown in Annex III. 1(a).&#13;
D. THE DESIGN OF THE AUTOMATION DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM&#13;
12.   The design of the automation development component of each program will be closely integrated&#13;
within the institutional strengthening program of each participating bank.  It will, therefore, be only&#13;
progressively defined, based on the conclusions of the diagnostic studies, the financial condition and prospects&#13;
of each bank, and the automation strategy that will be integrated in the overall strategic plan to be developed&#13;
by each bank as the first stage of its institutional development program. As a consequence, the initiation of&#13;
these automation programs will typically start between 6 months and 1 year after the beginning of the&#13;
institutional ones. A typical program will include financing for information technology experts to write user&#13;
specifications, as well as for the provision of hardware and software, and for training. The low capital base&#13;
of participating banks, together with the basic requirements of sound foreign exchange risk management, calls&#13;
for cautious and progressive automation development strategies and for prudent foreign exchange borrowing&#13;
policies. These two constraints will be fully taken into account in the design of the technological sub-&#13;
components of each bank program and are reflected in the following description of the financing aspects of&#13;
this project.&#13;
E. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE FINANCING OF THIS COMPONENT&#13;
13.   The component related to commercial banking development of the loan of the World Bank to the&#13;
Government of Kazakhstan will be matched with grant funding and will be on-lent by NBK to participating&#13;
banks at the following conditions:&#13;
Grant Funding:      For each bank, 50 percent of the cost of the institutional development program, up&#13;
to a maximum US$1.5 million.&#13;
Loan Amount:        For each bank, the remaining cost of the institutional and automation development&#13;
program, up to a maximum US$3 million or the amount of the capital of the bank,&#13;
whichever is the lowest.&#13;
Currency:           US dollar&#13;
Term:               10 years&#13;
Grace period:       4 years&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 6 of 6                            Annex 111.2(b)&#13;
Interest Rate:      Interest rate of 10-year U.S. Treasury Notes, plus 2 percent, adjusted and payable&#13;
semi-annually.&#13;
Commitment Fee:    The commitment fee shall be a percentage equivalent to that paid by the Government&#13;
on undisbursed amounts of the World Bank Loan. The commitment fee shall be&#13;
payable on the undisbursed amount of the respective subloan, beginning to accrue 60&#13;
days after the date of the signature of the on-lending agreement.&#13;
Repayment Term:      During the grace period, interest only. Afterwards, semi-annual installments of equal&#13;
amounts of principal plus interest on the remaining outstanding principal.&#13;
F. TIMETABLE&#13;
14.    The comprehensive institutional and operational diagnostic studies started in August 1994, with draft&#13;
all but two report completed in draft form in January 1995, and finalization of all reports expected by end&#13;
March 1995. On the basis of their conclusions, preliminary contacts between foreign and local banks will be&#13;
rapidly initiated in order for the banks to be in a position to launch their invitation for proposals in early 1995.&#13;
The first contract for the institutional development components is expected to be signed before end August&#13;
1995, and for the last of the four banks before end 1995. These contracts will cover periods of 2 to 3 years,&#13;
according to the strategy and the absorption capacity of each local bank. The automation development&#13;
components will typically be launched during the first quarter of 1996, and their implementation shall be&#13;
completed in the last of the four banks by mid-1997.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN&#13;
FINANCIAL AND ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR ON-SITE BANK SUPERVISION, PHASE II&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
I1.    An important aspect of the transition process to a market economy in the Republic of Kazakhstan is&#13;
the development of capacity for prudential supervision over the banking system by the National Bank of the&#13;
Republic of Kazakhstan (NBK) . Since the system of prudential supervision in the country is in its formative&#13;
stages, it is necessarily beset by a number of problems. These include shortage of adequately trained staff;&#13;
problems of effectively dealing with the large specialized banks; supervisory procedures that were designed&#13;
to ensure compliance with economic regulations which are now outdated; and a financial system that is heavily&#13;
distorted by a massive outstanding amount of subsidized credit and of non-performing loans to loss-making&#13;
state enterprises. NBK and the Government have started to reform the monetary policy and to better control&#13;
the situation of state enterprises, which would make it possible for prudential supervision to be more effective.&#13;
2.    The World Bank will provide a first phase of assistance to NBK's new Bank Supervision Department&#13;
(BSD) between spring 1995 and spring 1997 under a Technical Assistance Loan. Two resident experts will&#13;
train teams of newly recruited BSD staff in basic on-site examination skills on the job by conducting with them&#13;
partial examinations of some twelve banks per year. In the first year they will thus train about twenty staff.&#13;
In the second year, they will repeat that training with a new batch of about twenty further new staff.&#13;
3.    This basic training needs to be enhanced by further training in specialized bank supervision skills,&#13;
adjusted to the specific circumstances of the banking sector. As in most transition economies, Kazakhstan's&#13;
banks vary in performance, and many are in a fragile condition. Therefore, BSD is likely to face problems&#13;
in the following areas -- problem banks, risk management, quality of loan portfolios, insufficient liquidity and&#13;
solvency ratios, indirectly connected lending, and volatility of banks' financial conditions. The BSD staff that&#13;
has been trained for one year in basic supervision skills should therefore be further trained in a second year&#13;
in these specific areas. This training will again take place on the job, through actual examinations of banks&#13;
with the guidance of foreign advisors. This phase II of the training for on-site bank supervision will be&#13;
supported by this component of the Bank's Finance and Enterprises Development Loan.&#13;
B. OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.     The main objective of this component is to deepen the technical assistance provided for on-site&#13;
examination in phase I under the Technical Assistance Loan, by funding specialized on-the-job training in&#13;
priority areas. Specifically, the goals are to strengthen the capabilities of BSD in the areas mentioned above,&#13;
through:&#13;
* enhanced staff skills and experience, and through on-the-job training;&#13;
* the development of specific examination guidelines and manuals, and of methodologies required to adapt&#13;
usual standards to the Kazakh economic environment;&#13;
* specific policy advice to BSD and NBK officials; and&#13;
* setting precedents of quality examinations and follow-ups of commercial banks in various conditions and&#13;
of intervening in problem banks.&#13;

Page 2 of 5                               Annex 111.3&#13;
C. ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
5.     This Project component will overlap and deepen the basic on-site supervision training provided in&#13;
phase I through on-the-job training under the Technical Assistance Loan (2 experts for about 2 years); some&#13;
classroom training under an European Union grant, executed by the Bank of England; and classroom training&#13;
as well active off-site supervision advice provided under a USAID grant. Phase I should start in March, 1995,&#13;
but not before the NBK has completed to hire the first batch of recruits. Phase II will commence after the&#13;
first year of phase I is largely completed. The trainees of phase I will enter phase 11 of the program for a year&#13;
of more specialized training. At the same time, a second batch of new trainees will enter phase 1; they will&#13;
then commence their phase II training in early 1997. The NBK will continue hiring new staff for the division&#13;
of on-site examination to reach a total of about 10 older staff and 40 newly recruited staff by the end of 1995.&#13;
6.     For phase 11, the World Bank will finance two advisors starting the earliest in January 1996, or close&#13;
to a year after the NBK has recruited the necessary staff and started phase I of the assistance. These advisors&#13;
will assist in conducting full on-site examinations and interventions in problem banks with the trained staff.&#13;
They will also help develop appropriate manuals and guidelines; participate in higher-level discussions on the&#13;
results of the examinations; and provide policy advice to the BSD and to NBK officials. One of the two&#13;
advisors will be specialized in risk management and dealing with problem banks. The second new advisor&#13;
will specialize in loan processing procedures and in loan portfolio classification.&#13;
7.     The BSD will select, with the recommendations of the phase I and II World Bank-funded advisors,&#13;
eight BSD staff who have demonstrated outstanding performance during training and bank examinations in&#13;
phase I to act in future as examination team leaders. The phase II advisors will then assist teams of examiners&#13;
who will have been trained in Phase I to execute comprehensive examinations of banks. It is expected that&#13;
each team will be comprised of five persons, including the team leader, and will work under the guidance of&#13;
the bank supervision advisor. Each training cycle/examination is expected to last approximately three months.&#13;
It is estimated that during one year the advisors together would assist at least twelve full examinations.&#13;
8.     The technical assistance will be carried out over a period of up to 2 years, starting in about January&#13;
1996. This will permit effective use of the technical assistance and help avoid overload of limited counterpart&#13;
resources within the bank supervision department.&#13;
D. COUNTERPART AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
9.     The agency in charge of implementing this project, as part of the World Bank's Finance and&#13;
Enterprises Development Loan, is the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK). The Project Implementation Unit&#13;
for this component of the Financial and Enterprise Development Loan will be responsible for contractual and&#13;
logistical arrangements. The technical main counterpart agency for this component will be the Banking&#13;
Supervision Department of the NBK.&#13;
10.   The two new advisors will work under the leadership of the lead advisor on Phase I, until his&#13;
departure. At that time, one of the new advisors will be selected as team leader. The advisors will also&#13;
closely coordinate activities with the resident banking supervision specialists of other donor agencies,&#13;
especially the EU-funded classroom trainer and the IMF and USAID-funded advisors on off-site examination,&#13;
bank licensing, supervision regulations, and BSD organization, to the extent that they are still employed by&#13;
that time.&#13;

E. ACTIVITIES AND OUTPUTS&#13;
(a) On-the-job training and advise in the execution of full examinations&#13;
To prepare for the examinations, the BSD Director, the manager of the on-site supervision division, together&#13;
with the advisors will prepare a list of the twelve banks to be examined during the first year by the foreign&#13;
advisors and staff of the BSD. The NBK plans to make material related to these banks available to the&#13;
advisors, in order for them to prepare the examinations. Meetings between the BSD and the banks will be&#13;
arranged by BSD to present the advisors and the examination teams to these banks in order to coordinate the&#13;
examination work. These meetings will take place at least two weeks prior to every examination.&#13;
Examinations will increasingly allow the participation and responsibility of BSD's new examination team&#13;
leaders. The advisors will:&#13;
(i)  propose the selection criteria for the twelve banks to be fully examined during the first year of Phase&#13;
II, and the topics to be covered during these examinations; of those banks, some will be classified as&#13;
problem banks, and will be examined under the advice of the specialized advisor on problem banks;&#13;
(ii)  assist the preparation of materials necessary to conduct the examinations, including what may be&#13;
available in the banks, and conduct strategy sessions with the BSD team who will participate in the&#13;
examinations;&#13;
(iii) conduct four three-day preparatory sessions on the specific tasks to be carried out by each team during&#13;
the examinations;&#13;
(iv) advise in the execution of the examinations; it is expected that each examination will last for up to three&#13;
months and that each advisor will be responsible for six banks per year;&#13;
(v)  provide assistance and guidance for the preparation of the examination report and review inputs from&#13;
BSD staff participating in the examinations;&#13;
(vi) prepare and monitor a follow-up scheme aimed at periodically reviewing the implementation of the&#13;
examiner's recommendations, and assist in the preparation of a conclusion for those banks where the&#13;
process of examination, implementation, and review has been completed.&#13;
(b) Policy Advice and Guidelines&#13;
Formal meetings will be held weekly between the Director or Deputy Director of BSD, the head of the on-site&#13;
supervision division, and the advisors of phases I and II of the program to discuss the development of the&#13;
program. The advisors will:&#13;
(i)  provide advice to BSD and other NBK officers as appropriate on issues that they identify during the&#13;
examination process, and on strategies to deal with specific issues of problem banks,and on others&#13;
related to banking supervision as requested by the NBK;&#13;
(ii)  conduct at least two half-day seminars in the first year on the examination of problem banks, risk&#13;
management, and portfolio classification, for NBK's leadership and higher level staff. Similar brief&#13;
high-level seminars will be conducted in the second year;&#13;
(iii) hold two half-day seminars on problem banks, risk management, and loan classification for commercial&#13;
bank managers;&#13;
(iv) prepare technical notes to be included in the bank examination manuals and guidelines that will be used&#13;
by the division. They will not be intended to be used as a unique source of knowledge in the subject,&#13;
since the overall goal is to develop the personal analytical skills of the examiners. The manuals shall&#13;
be targeted to deal with the specific conditions of the banks in Kazakhstan, and aim at facilitating the&#13;
introduction of internationally accepted banking practices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 4 of 5                               Annex Ill.3&#13;
(c) Formal Training&#13;
The resident foreign advisors will:&#13;
(i)  coordinate with the USAID-funded trainers and the phase I advisors on the classroom training program&#13;
on problem banks, risk management, loan processing procedures, and portfolio analysis and&#13;
classification, and on the assessment of the overall financial condition, including its sustainability, of&#13;
banks;&#13;
(ii) help BSD and the USAID-funded trainers prepare training materials for the seminars on dealing with&#13;
problem banks and risk management, which should include case studies on actual on-site examinations&#13;
of problem banks and of loan portfolio analysis and classification methods;&#13;
(iii) provide further instructive materials in Russian, which should be targeted at the specific level of skills&#13;
of the BSD staff and at the status of the banking sector; and&#13;
(iv) during the second year of their assignment, continue some of the classroom training that had in the first&#13;
year been provided by the USAID-funded trainers. The training should be concentrated on perfecting&#13;
examination techniques, and on problems banks, risk management, and portfolio analysis. The advisors&#13;
will conduct at least two one-week courses.&#13;
11.   Confidentiality. This program is being carried out exclusively for the purpose of developing a basis&#13;
for strengthening the banking supervision capabilities of the NBK and initiating on-site bank examination&#13;
practices. Accordingly, the advisors will neither discuss with nor distribute to parties outside the NBK, the&#13;
World Bank, and the management of the relevant bank, without their explicit authorization, any aspects or&#13;
details relating to their findings.&#13;
F. REPORTING&#13;
12.    The advisors will submit an inception report no later than six weeks after commencing their&#13;
assignment. Thereafter, they will submit quarterly reports on the implementation of the project. All reports&#13;
shall be submitted to the NBK in two Russian language and one English language copies, respectively; and&#13;
to the World Bank in two English copies. These reports shall be in informal style. All such reports will&#13;
enumerate the inputs, activities and outputs of the last period; the contribution to the project objectives; the&#13;
problems encountered, remedies sought, and further remedies ; the detailed plans for the coming period; and&#13;
suggested changes to the plans for subsequent periods; and miscellaneous further issues. The reports will&#13;
annex all distributed training materials and contributions to examination manuals and guidelines. The&#13;
examination reports shall be provided to the NBK and the examined banks in two Russian-language copies,&#13;
respectively. The World Bank will be provided access to these reports by NBK upon request.&#13;
G. ADVISORS QUALIFICATIONS&#13;
13.   The advisors should be bank examiners and/or auditors with extensive experience in the preparation&#13;
of examination reports, who have also experience in training. One of them must have recognized experience&#13;
in examination of and strategy formulation for problem banks. The other must have loan portfolio analysis&#13;
and classification experience in developing financial systems. They should also have policy advice experience.&#13;
Familiarity with transition economies will be highly valued. Advisors shall not be replaced, during the course&#13;
of the program, without the prior agreement of NBK and the World Bank. Knowledge of the Russian or&#13;
Kazakh languages will be highly appreciated.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN&#13;
FINANCIAL AND ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
LONG-TERM PAYMENT SYSTEM&#13;
CONCEPT NOTE&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The transformation of a centrally planned economy into a market economy fundamentally changes the&#13;
role and operation of the payments system. In a well developed market, the payments system is an effective&#13;
mechanism for (i) channeling credit transfers to producers and consumers of goods and services, (ii) improving&#13;
the availability of working capital to enterprises to meet their trade obligations, (iii) facilitating foreign&#13;
investments, (iv) playing a critical role in market economies by expediting the circulation of money between&#13;
economic players, (v) regulating the financial conduct and viability of the participants, (vi) facilitating proper&#13;
financial sector operations oversight of credit and liquidity risks, (vii) reduce the float in the system, 8)&#13;
improve liquidity management, and, (viii) protect the rights of financial intermediaries and customers. The&#13;
proposed component of the Project is designed to support the establishment of these objectives in Kazakhstan's&#13;
financial sector through a long-term program.&#13;
2.    The concepts in this component have been coordinated with the overall policy framework&#13;
recommended by the IMF and its cooperative partners. These partners include payment system technical&#13;
specialists from the Bank of Japan, and experts of the Bank of France for the implementation of a new chart&#13;
of accounts of the National Bank for financial reporting, monitoring and statistical analysis.&#13;
3.    On recommendations from both IMF and the World Bank, a separate Payment System Division has&#13;
been created within the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NBK) to take a lead role in the&#13;
coordination activities concomitant with the design and operation of the payments system. An Information&#13;
Technology Sub-committee has also been formed to evaluate the technical features of the payments system and&#13;
promote the transfer of responsibility for processing of customer and ledger accounts from NBK to the&#13;
commercial banks.&#13;
B. THE PRESENT PAYMENTS SYSTEM&#13;
4.    Nineteen regional clearing centers are presently supporting a daily average of 200,000+ intra and&#13;
70,000 inter-bank financial obligations and transactions. These volumes are expected to grow at an annual&#13;
rate of at least 10% though growth rates of 25% could be expected in view of the present low base. These&#13;
transactions are settled within 2-3 work days in the greater Almaty area, where electronic data transfers have&#13;
been introduced recently. Regional transactions are settled within 7-10 work days resulting in a high negative&#13;
float (a net reduction in monetary assets held by financial intermediaries); the additional delay is due primarily&#13;
to an inadequate telecommunication infrastructure, and the geographic dispersions of the regional clearing&#13;
centers. Special courier services have been contracted to reduce the data transmission delays to and between&#13;
the clearing centers. The clearing centers are all automated, with the finality of settlements being performed&#13;
at each region where each branch of each bank has a correspondent account (settlement account) and a reserve&#13;
account for each bank is maintained at Almaty. These accounts are debited after they are checked against&#13;
incoming transactions for sufficient cover. If there is insufficient cover in an account, all debits on that&#13;
account are frozen pending injection of funds (refinancing or overdrafts) by NBK, or receipt of credits against&#13;
that branch account. Owing to deficient data processing capacities and linkages between regional centers, the&#13;
settlement balances are "netted out" twice a month at Almaty, and the reports distributed thereafter to the&#13;
commercial banks. This, coupled with the lack of an accurate and timely in-house account maintenance&#13;
capability and knowledge of aggregate reserves/correspondent balances across the branch network, forces&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 2 of 7                                Annex 111.4&#13;
financial institutions to maintain a high level of correspondent reserves at each branch. The correspondent&#13;
and reserve accounts are maintained independently, increasing the domestic "float" in the system, which shows&#13;
up on the books of NBK and therefore reduces the overall liquidity of the banking system.&#13;
5.    In addition to the nineteen NBK Clearing Centers, there are about 255 Cash Centers at the district and&#13;
19 at the regional levels. These support the distribution of currency to financial institutions, the provision of&#13;
working capital/account maintenance for state-owned enterprises, and the collection and transmittal of&#13;
debit/credit advices to the Clearing Centers for computer processing. The Cash Centers lack adequate&#13;
automated processing capacities, and the need to use courier/postal/teletype services in some cases, for&#13;
transmission of data to the clearing centers, contribute to the system delays. Some bank branches have a&#13;
rudimentary electronic linkages to the regional centers for data transmissions, though the lack of adequate&#13;
regulations/controls has resulted in some cases of fraud. The recent introduction of checks for wholesale&#13;
trades has not been entirely successful due to an insufficient legal framework to protect against fraud.&#13;
However, the continued use of checks in the future is being encouraged, as the appropriate rules, regulations&#13;
and standards will be developed during the design of the payments system.&#13;
6.     There are five large commercial banks with the People's Bank (former Savings Bank) having the&#13;
largest branch network of 4,400 branches, of which about 1,200 may be considered to be significant deposit&#13;
mobilizers with more than 10,000 accounts each. It has a staff strength of approximately 18,000. The other&#13;
four banks have branch networks ranging from 30 to 330 branches. These four banks are making concerted&#13;
efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in their internal account processing and institutional operations through&#13;
internal automation programs. These are microcomputer-based with local area networks and accounting&#13;
software developed locally. The more active and bigger of the branches are now submitting end-of-day&#13;
balances electronically, together with supporting documentation, to the regional centers in an attempt to reduce&#13;
the processing delays. This system engineering is suitable for smaller banks, although some of them are&#13;
rapidly growing; the larger banks would need to graduate to a more sophisticated architecture in order to&#13;
improve liquidity management and customer service.  A number of critical constraints are, however,&#13;
hampering the commercial banks in their efforts to improve their operations. These include:&#13;
* The NBK payments system (and customer accounting) software developed in Russia is relatively old and&#13;
does not support the modalities of a two-tier banking system -- e.g. individual clearing accounts are&#13;
maintained for each branch of each bank, revaluations are not supported, and the concept of paper&#13;
truncation (electronic version of paper-based instructions) has not been introduced. Additionally, the&#13;
computer hardware(s) are operating at full capacity resulting in processing delays. Recently, NBK has&#13;
replaced this hardware and accounting software with a newer accounting software, again developed in&#13;
Russia, which operates on powerful microcomputers and performs account closings within 3 hours. The&#13;
microcomputers were partly purchased by NBK and partly supplemented with those procured through&#13;
the Bank's Technical Assistance Loan. This is a temporary measure pending the implementation of a&#13;
long-term in-house solution in the banks themselves. However, this interim solution does ameliorate&#13;
somewhat the overall processing timeframes.&#13;
* The lack of institutional capacity, and foreign exchange resources, on part of commercial banks to&#13;
computerize their accounts which are still being maintained centrally by NBK. Because of the inefficient&#13;
data processing support from NBK, the bank branches receive their daily account statements, from the&#13;
regional centers, after at least a three day delay while liquidity reports are generated monthly. This&#13;
results in poor loan portfolio, credit risk, treasury functions and network liquidity management, and,&#13;
necessitates bank branches to maintain manual "shadow" accounts.&#13;
* The inefficient payment and accounting system -- with concomitant uneven and uncertain cash flows --&#13;
also contributes to the large inter-enterprise arrears through slow execution of payments, ineffective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 3 of 7                              Annex 111.4&#13;
management of working capital, and risks associated with automatic granting of overdraft facilities in&#13;
the absence of accurate account balances.&#13;
* Locally developed microcomputer-based accounting software does not conform to the requirements of&#13;
modern commercial banking practices for both front and back-office operations, including the basic&#13;
requirements of treasury management and double-entry accounting functions.&#13;
C. THE PROPOSED REFORM STRATEGY&#13;
(a) Interim Improvements&#13;
7.    The Project would support the design and implementation of a long-term payments system/network&#13;
which would be owned and operated by the NBK. As an interim measure, the World Bank's Technical&#13;
Assistance Loan is instituting by mid-1995 a few key short term and low cost improvements to the existing&#13;
payments hardware and software; these are again being implemented by NBK. These improvements basically&#13;
build on the newly introduced accounting system which maintains the accounts of the banks, and would be&#13;
a precursor to the more comprehensive solution. The interim improvements support:&#13;
* the procurement and installation of powerful microcomputers or work stations, and telecommunication&#13;
devices at the Cash Offices and the Regional Clearing Centers. The end-of-day accounting cycle would&#13;
be accomplished within 3 hours at each regional center. The regional centers would "net" the reserve&#13;
and settlement accounts for each bank, and transmit electronically the "netted" clearing balances to NBK&#13;
headquarters;&#13;
* data entry of payment orders at the Cash Centers and forwarding of inter and intra-transactions&#13;
electronically to the regional centers. This will reduce the workload at the clearing centers, and facilitate&#13;
monitoring and control of corporate liquidity and reserve positions;&#13;
* the possibility of transmitting "high value" inter-bank transactions on a priority basis from regional&#13;
offices to NBK headquarters and enacting the finality of "next day" settlements on the books of NBK;&#13;
* creation of an overnight inter-bank indebtedness matrices at the regional centers and a national matrix&#13;
in Almaty, after the existing NBK accounting system successfully updates the accounts. This would&#13;
facilitate the generation of overnight liquidity (correspondent and reserve balances) reports for each bank.&#13;
The NBK has directed the banks to consolidate their correspondent accounts; the above attributes would&#13;
enable the banks to accomplish this feature; and&#13;
* the operation of the new chart of accounts/accounting software for the automatic generation of&#13;
accounting entries with data entry being limited to specific data items (e.g. sector, type of institution).&#13;
(b) Lon,e-Term Payments System Objectives.&#13;
8.    The second phase of the payment system modernization program would start concurrently with the&#13;
implementation of the short term solution, but the long-term system will start operating only after more than&#13;
2-3 years after the interim system -- upon start of the long-term system, the equipment purchased in 1994 for&#13;
the interim system will be used to support the long-term system, as explained below. External specialists&#13;
(contracted by NBK in coordination with the other financial institutions) have been undertaking a study to&#13;
elaborate on the feasibility and design of the long-term program. The study is scheduled to be completed by&#13;
end March 1995.  The NBK has already undertaken to implement certain key business and policy&#13;
recommendations made by both IMF and the World Bank. A number of policy decisions were tentatively&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 4 of 7                                Annex III.4&#13;
agreed on by NBK; these decisions are being incorporated by the consultants in the design of the long-term&#13;
payments system unless there was a justifiable reason for a modification.&#13;
9.     Some of the objectives of the new system would be to: (i) perform finality of settlements on a daily&#13;
basis, consolidation of cash in vault, reserve, settlement balances; (ii) maintenance of one settlement account&#13;
per institution; (iii) acceptance of both gross and netted values (with the latter emerging from bi-lateral and&#13;
multi-lateral clearing arrangements); (iv) development of a "real time" high value system; and (v) inclusion&#13;
of private sector representatives in the decision making process to foster cooperation and competition and also&#13;
support private sector initiatives for bi or multi-lateral clearings between financial institutions.  The&#13;
modernization program would include the establishment of:&#13;
* the reconstitution of the National Payments Council to provide oversight over the development and&#13;
implementation of the payments system;&#13;
* an internal NBK senior management team responsible for the conceptualization of the payments system&#13;
and for coordinating decision-making across organizational boundaries;&#13;
* a financial risk management framework and regulations (including incentives/penalties for compliance&#13;
with standard timeframes for finality of settlements) defined in cooperation with trade groups and&#13;
financial players. This would support the operation of an inter-bank market by shortening the maturity&#13;
of the financial trades, and facilitate the development of new money market instruments and government&#13;
securities. The framework would also importantly enforce the concept that NBK should be the "lender&#13;
of last resort";&#13;
* the definition of NBK's role in the finality of settlements, overdraft/refinancing mechanisms, queuing&#13;
rules, avoidance of systemic failures, audits etc.;&#13;
* rules for identifying pricing norms/structures for the cost effective utilization of the payment network,&#13;
financial intermediaries and participants; institutional structure of the network; payment system&#13;
membership rights; competition and cooperation; and, legal recourse for the customers of the system;&#13;
* the definition of national standards (for existing and planned instruments and magnetic cards) and&#13;
linkages with international networks (e.g. Swift);&#13;
* the provision of a retail book-entry capability and accommodation of credit/pre-paid cards, checks and&#13;
other financial instruments;&#13;
* appropriate data security and back-up features to prevent fraud and systemic failures, as well as to ensure&#13;
continuity of operations; and&#13;
* the possibility of the ultimate privatization of the three regional clearing centers, with NBK retaining the&#13;
processing of the settlement function.&#13;
(c) System Architecture&#13;
10.    This component of the Financial and Enterprises Development Project would support the&#13;
implementation of reasonably powerful computer system(s) at three major regional sites (Almaty, Northeast&#13;
and West), with all three of them supporting clearing functions but only the Almaty center accomplishing&#13;
settlements and maintaining the settlement (correspondent) accounts. This architecture was based on a&#13;
volume/workload analysis of existing and expected transactional activities. Additionally, the loan would&#13;
include payments system application software, and telecommunication links to ensure that the clearing centers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 5 of 7                               Annex III.4&#13;
and financial intermediaries are networked, and that the NBK oversight role is supported adequately. This&#13;
architecture was discussed with both NBK and the consultants performing the payments system feasibility&#13;
study, and was endorsed by all parties. The three centers would each have duplexed machines for back-up,&#13;
while the Almaty database (comprising almost 66% of the national workload) would be replicated in the&#13;
Northeast region for effective disaster recovery. This network would be owned and operated by NBK and&#13;
be known as the National Payment Network. The Project would include substantive classroom and on-job&#13;
training, and facilities management for an initial limited period until NBK staff become self sufficient. The&#13;
selected contractor would be required to perform the detailed design, programming and implementation of the&#13;
payment system application software within the framework identified through the feasibility study.&#13;
(d) NBK Functions&#13;
11.   The National Bank computer network would also enable NBK to improve its central banking functions&#13;
(e.g. foreign exchange, balance of payments, bank supervision, statistical analysis, general and subsidiary&#13;
ledger accounting) through the procurement, customization and implementation of a comprehensive banking&#13;
application software package. The network would allow both "gross" and "netted" financial obligations to&#13;
be received from banks in electronic and paper-based media, with the latter being phased-out as the banks&#13;
become technologically self supportive. The NBK headquarters would have access to an on-line inter-bank&#13;
indebtedness matrix for oversight purposes as well as for injection of collateral, refinancing etc. to avoid&#13;
system failure. The project could also support the establishment of an off-site prudential supervision system&#13;
which would complement the on-site activities and provide indicators to assist in identifying problem areas.&#13;
(e) Telecommunication Network&#13;
12.   The use of satellite communication links between the three regional sites would be investigated, and&#13;
utilized if determined to be cost effective; a planned fiber optic link between Almaty and the Northeast region&#13;
could also be utilized for the back-up of the Almaty database. The poor feeder links from remotely located&#13;
bank branches to the three clearing centers would be facilitated with the availability of the 255 cash center&#13;
workstations and modems that are part of the Interim Payment System) to act as "gateways" to the network&#13;
where the bank branches cannot, or decide not to, use the telephone lines on a dial-up basis. The cash centers&#13;
in the future would only maintain public sector accounts as well as perform as cash distribution centers; it is&#13;
quite feasible that their number would be reduced in the future, but the telecommunication gateway equipment&#13;
would be retained to facilitate linkages with the payments system network.&#13;
(f) Commercial Banks' Customer Accounting&#13;
13.   A complimentary sub-component of this Long-Term Payment System component would support&#13;
commercial banks to become self-sufficient in their customer accounting functions by making available a&#13;
modern banking software package. This package would be the same as that for internal NBK operations and&#13;
would be complemented with a version for microcomputers -- or at least be well integrated and seamless with&#13;
the minicomputer version installed at the clearing centers etc. To achieve this target, NBK would identify a&#13;
cut-off date for commercial banks to become self-sufficient, which is presently targeted for early 1997. After&#13;
this date, NBK would discontinue processing the customer accounts for commercial banks. Two senior&#13;
banking/information technology specialists financed through this Loan, would for the initial year advise and&#13;
audit -- on a as and when required basis -- the commercial banks' on their individual automation programs,&#13;
and recommend cost effective solutions. Some of the benefits expected through the availability of a modern&#13;
and comprehensive banking application software package include:&#13;
* improved financial and treasury management, and asset and liability management;&#13;
* foreign exchange management and foreign exchange correspondent banking;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 6 of 7                               Annex 111.4&#13;
* enhanced credit risk management and development of credit policies and procedures, creditworthiness&#13;
analysis, problem loan management, and the design of secure lending instruments;&#13;
* better quality of services and streamlined operations to accommodate new instruments (such as factoring,&#13;
leasing, and mortgage financing); and&#13;
* upgrading of accounting practices, in particular the development of financial, cost, and management&#13;
accounting.&#13;
14.   In the case of four large and four medium-size banks, the customer accounting would also be&#13;
facilitated by the provision of computer hardware etc. as part of their development programs funded by this&#13;
World Bank Loan (for four banks) and EBRD (for further four banks). For the remaining state-owned, private&#13;
and joint-stock commercial banks, the banking application software package would be made available at a&#13;
charge to be determined by the National Payments Council; they would need to procure the hardware from&#13;
their own budgets.&#13;
(g) Coordination with Magnetic Card Program&#13;
15.    NBK is implementing a modern magnetic card message authentication and switching center as a "pilot"&#13;
exercise in a selected regional location, and envisages a nationwide use of magnetic cards (debit and credit)&#13;
in an increasingly "cash-less" economy. NBK plans to seek co-financing by other donors or even joint venture&#13;
arrangements for this endeavor. The design of the payment system would assure that such initiatives would&#13;
be closely interconnected to capture any cross border, high value and "netted" obligations which would affect&#13;
liquidity and reserve positions.&#13;
D. IMPLEMENTATION, COSTS AND RISKS&#13;
16.   The investment costs of this project are estimated at a total of approximately US$23.85 million. Of&#13;
this, the general banking application software sub-component including software licensing, customization, and&#13;
advisory information technology services amount to about US$5 million equivalent. Thereof about US$2.2&#13;
million equivalent are incremental costs for making the software also available to a number of commercial&#13;
banks (especially those that do no participate in the institutional development program for banks); the other&#13;
costs stem from NBK's computing needs for its own operations (see above). The cost of the payments system&#13;
network itself is expected to total about US$19 million equivalent. The operating costs for the first three years&#13;
would amount to US$2.2 million in foreign currency and about T46 million (US$0.9 million equivalent).&#13;
17.   The implementation schedule foresees the commencement of operation by July 1997, and completion&#13;
of the last implementation steps -- on-site implementation assistance and operations management by the&#13;
supplier -- by June 1998.&#13;
18.   The reform process and the system design are aimed at minimizing various potential risks: (i) The&#13;
system design would be flexible enough to accommodate both gross and netted inputs, which would be&#13;
important if there are future changes in major commercial banks' modus operandi and in bi-lateral clearing&#13;
arrangements. (ii) Commercial banks might well decide to perform multi-lateral clearings, and transmit the&#13;
"netted" balances to the Payments System's network workload. However, the NBK network would still be&#13;
required for settlements on the books of the NBK, and for NBK's internal central banking functions.&#13;
Moreover, the NBK system would still process on a gross basis the high value transactions, and those low&#13;
value transactions that are not covered by multi-lateral clearing. In any case, the largest banks would likely&#13;
not be able to implement comprehensive multi-lateral clearing for several years. (iii) There is a potential risk&#13;
of delays in the computerization of commercial banks' operations. However, competition and a mandated cut-&#13;
off date for banks to achieve self-sufficiency would pressure the banks to institute effective automation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 7 of 7                                Annex 111.4&#13;
programs and linkages. The availability of application software would also assist the banks in this endeavor.&#13;
(iv) Delays in the implementation of the new network would be minimized by phasing, under the Project,&#13;
payments to the contractor on the basis of milestones and specific pre-defined deliverables.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN&#13;
FINANCIAL AND ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The Republic of Kazakhstan envisages concluding with the World Bank an Agreement for a Financial&#13;
and Enterprises Development Loan of US$61 million to support critical institution and infrastructure building&#13;
in the financial and enterprise sectors. The Project has been prepared since 1993; Loan negotiations were&#13;
conducted in January 1995; and the Project is planned to be implemented from April 1995 until end 1997.&#13;
2.    The Loan would help finance information and communication technology, training, and technical&#13;
assistance. In the enterprise sector, the Project would: (i) continue the World Bank's assistance for the&#13;
implementation of the Government's privatization program, including case-by-case privatization; (ii) provide&#13;
advisory services for the defensive restructuring and privatization of distressed large enterprises, or for their&#13;
liquidation; and (iii) transfer modem market economic know-how to enterprise managers through a program&#13;
of highly structured study tours. In the financial sector, the Project would support: (i) advice for the start-up&#13;
and operation of a debt resolution institution ("Rehabilitation Trust") to force the restructuring and resolve the&#13;
debts of thirty to forty insolvent enterprises that burden the banks, state budget, and other creditors most&#13;
severely; (ii) institutional development programs for two promising medium-size banks and restructuring&#13;
programs for two large, formerly specialized banks, consisting of intensive three-year assistance by foreign&#13;
banks ("twinning") and of equipment and software for bank automation; (iii) strengthening of prudential bank&#13;
supervision at the National Bank through on-the-job training of bank examiners, with increasing specialization&#13;
on problem banks; and (iv) the long-term investments for a new domestic payment system aimed at, inter alia,&#13;
same-day finality of settlements and real time processing of high value transactions. In addition, the Loan&#13;
would fund assistance for the implementation of this Project.&#13;
3.    Government authority for the management and implementation of the Financial and Enterprises&#13;
Development Project will lie for the main financial sector components (payment system, commercial bank&#13;
development program, and bank supervision) with the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NBK);&#13;
for privatization assistance with the State Property Committee (SPC); and for the Rehabilitation Trust,&#13;
Restructuring Advisory Unit, and manager study tours program with the Ministry of Economy (MOE). NBK&#13;
has recently created a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) with four local staff within its External Economics&#13;
Relations Division. SPC is establishing a similar PIU, with at least two local staff, before end February.&#13;
MOE already has been operating a PIU for one and half years under the National Agency for Foreign&#13;
Investment (NAFI), which is located under MOE.&#13;
4.    The Project involves the procurement of goods such as computers, software, and telecommunication&#13;
equipment, especially for the financial sector components, as well as consultancy in all the above-mentioned&#13;
Project components.&#13;
5.    According to World Bank policy, procurement is the responsibility of the Borrower. However, for&#13;
many years before Kazakhstan's Independence, public sector procurement was carried out centrally from&#13;
Moscow through long established and experienced trading companies.  As a result, no international&#13;
procurement capability was developed locally at the time, and it is still limited today. Technical assistance&#13;
is therefore required to enable the above agencies to apply appropriate procurement practices as well as related&#13;
disbursement and other functions, for the efficient and timely use of scarce foreign exchange resources to&#13;
support critical reforms in the financial and enterprise sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 2 of 7                                Annex IV&#13;
B. OBJECTIVES&#13;
6.    It is proposed that the services of a consultant firm ("the Consultant") will be financed through the&#13;
use of proceeds from the Financial and Enterprises Development Loan and its Project Preparation Facility,&#13;
to assist technical staff at NBK, SPC, and MOE with the full range of procurement and disbursement advisory&#13;
services for a period of initially one year. The Consultant's services will be obtained through a competitive&#13;
selection process in compliance with the World Bank's guidelines.  Based on Project implementation&#13;
requirements, the extension of this contract beyond the first year will be subject to the prior review and&#13;
approval of the NBK, in consultation with SPC and MOE, and the World Bank. This Loan will provide&#13;
funding initially for 1 resident and 2 semi-resident advisors, and some limited home-office support.&#13;
C. RESPONSIBILITIES OF NBK, SPC, AND MOE IN THE PROJECT&#13;
(a) Overall Project Implementation&#13;
7.    Overall implementation responsibilities of NBK, SPC, and MOE in their respective areas of&#13;
responsibility under the said Loan will include the following:&#13;
* coordination of their activities with those of concerned ministries, other public entities, trading&#13;
companies, participating commercial banks, and consultants, in order to monitor project implementation&#13;
for ensuring consistency and timeliness of all the Project components;&#13;
* monitoring of the procurement of, and the disbursement for, the goods and services purchased through&#13;
the Loan;&#13;
* management and administration assistance as may be necessary for the successful implementation of their&#13;
assigned elements under the Loan, consistent with that of the overall Project;&#13;
* compilation of their respective component-related contributions to the Project Progress Reports and&#13;
Project Completion Report.&#13;
(b) Procurement&#13;
8.    NBK, SPC, and MOE, as well as the four participating local commercial banks (with regard to the&#13;
commercial bank development component) will be responsible for the procurement of all goods and services&#13;
under their respective Loan components. The following summary of responsibilities should be read with the&#13;
World Bank's Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
9.    Procurement of Goods. Goods to be procured under this Loan will consist primarily of computers,&#13;
telecommunication equipment, software, and office equipment. It is tentatively estimated that the Project will&#13;
entail 6-10 procurements through International Competitive Bidding (ICB). For procurement under ICB&#13;
procedures, NBK, SPC, MOE, and the participating local commercial banks, with the assistance of the&#13;
Procurement Consultant, will be responsible for undertaking and monitoring the following activities:&#13;
* advertising in local and international professional and press media, and advising foreign delegations of&#13;
Bank members countries, including CIS countries who have become members of the Bank, and Taiwan&#13;
(China);&#13;
* preparing bidding documents using the World Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for the procurement&#13;
of goods and computers, respectively;&#13;
* distributing/selling bidding documents to prospective bidders;&#13;
* inviting bids from suppliers in eligible countries;&#13;
* conducting the bid opening process and the evaluation of bids; and&#13;
* when designated to do so, signing and finalizing the contract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 3 of 7                                 Annex IV&#13;
10.    For non-ICB procurement, NBK, SPC, MOE, and the four participating local commercial banks,&#13;
assisted by the Consultant, would ensure that the appropriate procedures specified in the Loan Agreement, are&#13;
being followed, including:&#13;
* soliciting written quotations from a list of potential suppliers in eligible countries;&#13;
* soliciting quotation on sole-source basis and negotiating with suppliers for spare parts or other&#13;
proprietary items; and&#13;
* after receipt of a "no objection" notice from the World Bank to proceed with the process, placing&#13;
purchase orders and contracts with selected suppliers.&#13;
11.   In the area of contract administration, NBK, SPC, and MOE, assisted by the Consultant, will be&#13;
responsible for the following:&#13;
* collecting documentation, such as inspection certificates, certificates of origin/manufacturer/&#13;
manufacturers'/suppliers' guarantees, bills of lading, beneficiary insurance certificates, and&#13;
manufacturers' invoices;&#13;
* forwarding documentation to the clearing agent;&#13;
* handling insurance claims; and&#13;
* assisting in the preparation of withdrawal applications with the required supporting documentation, and&#13;
arranging payments to suppliers.&#13;
12.    Technical Assistance. For technical assistance and training, NBK, SPC, MOE, and the participating&#13;
local commercial banks, with assistance by the Consultant, would:&#13;
* prepare or, where drafts were already prepared during Project preparation, review and finalize Terms&#13;
of Reference acceptable to the World Bank, prepare consultant short lists, solicit proposals, review bid&#13;
evaluation and endorse consultant contracts, ensuring that the selection procedures and contracts comply&#13;
with the Loan Agreement and Project Agreement and with Bank guidelines for recruiting consultants;&#13;
and&#13;
* monitor the implementation of technical assistance contracts to ensure their timely execution. The above&#13;
concerned agencies would also ensure that the consultants receive the supporting services agreed&#13;
(secretarial support, counterpart staff, office facilities, etc.); can freely travel to, from, and within&#13;
Kazakhstan have access to documents and other necessary information; are paid in a timely and&#13;
professional manner; and provide acceptable outputs and periodic reports for each assistance component.&#13;
(c) Disbursement&#13;
13.    NBK, SPC, and MOE will be responsible for the disbursement of funds, the preparation of withdrawal&#13;
applications, and the collection of documents for their respective Loan components. Disbursement will start&#13;
once the Loan becomes effective, except for selected initial activities that are expected to be funded under the&#13;
Project Preparation Facility (PPF), which will be an advance to the Loan. The World Bank's Disbursement&#13;
Handbook, which outlines disbursement procedures for Bank Loans, provides additional information on the&#13;
procedures and should be read in conjunction with this section. Withdrawal applications will be fully&#13;
documented, except for expenditures against contracts valued at less than US$ 10,000 equivalent, which will&#13;
be made on the basis of certified statements of expenditures detailing the individual transactions. The&#13;
documentation to support these expenditures will be retained by NBK, SPC, and MOE, respectively, for at&#13;
least one year after receipt by the World Bank of the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement&#13;
is made. This documentation will be made available for review by the auditors (see sections below on&#13;
Reporting, Accounting, and Auditing) and the World Bank upon request.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 4 of 7                                Annex IV&#13;
14.   Project Preparation Facility (PPF). A PPF is expected to be approved prior to mid-March, 1995, to&#13;
finance some activities related to the start-up of project implementation. Disbursement procedures to be&#13;
followed under the PPF are the same as for the Loan, as discussed below.&#13;
15.   Special Account. To facilitate and expedite the disbursement of funds, NBK, SPC, and MOE will&#13;
each open a Special Account in a commercial bank acceptable to the World Bank. The Special Account will&#13;
be maintained in a fully convertible and stable currency. Documentation requirements for replenishment&#13;
allocations will follow the same procedure as described above. In addition, monthly bank statements of the&#13;
Special Accounts, which have been reconciled by the respective agency, should accompany all replenishment&#13;
requests.&#13;
16.   The commercial bank or banks selected to be the depository bank of each of the Special Accounts&#13;
should be selected as soon as possible (criteria are defined on page 31 of the Disbursement Handbook). These&#13;
Special Accounts should be in the name of the Borrower and will be administered by the respective authorized&#13;
representatives of NBK, SPC, and MOE on behalf of the Borrower. Two signatures will be required to&#13;
execute any transaction from an account. The Special Accounts will be replenished at monthly intervals, or&#13;
more frequently if necessary.&#13;
17.   Goods. For goods to be financed under this Loan, contracts will include payment terms and NBK,&#13;
SPC, and MOE will have to ascertain, before approving the contracts, that these payment terms are in line&#13;
with Bank disbursement procedures. The acceptable disbursement procedures for this component will be the&#13;
following:&#13;
* procedure of special commitments for letters of credit;&#13;
* in the case where no letter of credit has been used, direct payments to the suppliers by either of the&#13;
concerned agencies through the Special Account can also be effected.&#13;
(d) Reporting. Accounting and Auditing&#13;
18.    NBK, SPC, and MOE, with assistance by the Consultant, would each establish and maintain a sub-&#13;
system of their existing management information systems covering all procurements financed by the Loan&#13;
including information received on all procurement transactions, including the identity of the user, the kind of&#13;
goods purchased, the contract value, identification of the bidders and the winning supplier, the key dates for&#13;
the bidding process, and the subsequent fulfillment of the contract.&#13;
19.   The above information will allow NBK, SPC, and MOE to monitor their respective Project&#13;
implementation elements, and will also provide the basis for each of the concerned agencies to prepare the&#13;
regular Project Progress Reports and, together with the Bank, the Project Completion Report required after&#13;
the Loan has been disbursed and closed.&#13;
20.    NBK, SPC, and MOE would each also establish appropriate sets of accounts within their existing&#13;
accounting systems, in order to provide information on receipt and use of funds, in line with the terms of the&#13;
Loan Agreement. The system would ensure timely and accurate accounting of all transactions under the Loan,&#13;
and clear presentation of the financial information. It should enable identification of the use of all funds by&#13;
components and categories of good imported. The accounting should reflect the movement of the receipts and&#13;
payments through the Special Account, with balances agreed with monthly financial statements from the&#13;
holding commercial bank and with periodic statements from the World Bank.&#13;
21.   A condition of the Loan will be that the financial statements and reports on the Loan (including the&#13;
Special Accounts) be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the World Bank. As the NBK has considerable experience in financial matters and also is the&#13;
organization responsible for the implementation of the greater portion of the Loan, it is envisaged that it will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 5 of 7                                Annex IV&#13;
then assume the responsibility for engaging an experienced and qualified independent auditing firm through&#13;
a competitive selection process acceptable to the bank. The independent audit firm will conduct audits on&#13;
NBK, SPC, and MOE according to audit criteria and a report submission timetable acceptable to the World&#13;
Bank.&#13;
D. IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE TO NBK, SPC, AND MOE UNDER THIS PROJECT&#13;
22.   Concept of the Assistance: To enhance the capacity of NBK, SPC, and MOE to exercise the functions&#13;
described above, the Loan includes an implementation assistance component of a total US$1.5 million&#13;
equivalent, to be used over close to three years. The assistance would also benefit the four local commercial&#13;
banks that will be selected to participate in the commercial bank development component of the Project in their&#13;
procurement and contract administration activities.&#13;
23.   These terms of reference cover the first 12 months of the assistance. An experienced procurement&#13;
advisor firm (the Consultant) would provide advice, assistance, and training on procurement, contract&#13;
administration, disbursement, project reporting/accounting, and project coordination. It is envisaged that the&#13;
firm would place one full-time resident procurement advisor with particular information technology expertise&#13;
at NBK; a semi-resident advisor with mainly consultant procurement experience at SPC; and a (semi-)resident&#13;
advisor, with special experience in disbursements, spending about four person-months at MOE and allocating&#13;
about further 2-3 person-months to NBK and SPC, respectively, depending on workload. In close consultation&#13;
with NBK, the advisor(s) supporting NBK would also provide implementation assistance to the four&#13;
participating local commercial banks. The field team would receive back-up from headquarters of the&#13;
consultant company, especially in specialized information and communication technology matters, and be&#13;
supported by local assistants and translators/interpreters under contract with the firm. The advisor working&#13;
at NBK, or the one working at all three agencies, will be the leader of the consultant team; he or she will also&#13;
advise on, and assist, project coordination. Neither of the individuals shall be replaced except with the explicit&#13;
approval of NBK and the World Bank, and of SPC or MOE as will be appropriate.&#13;
24.   In the subsequent 1.5 to 2 years, implementation assistance would continue to be provided to NBK&#13;
and SPC but with fewer person-months per year, partly on a short-term basis. This future activity is not&#13;
covered by these terms of reference. Based on its performance during the first nine months, and the remaining&#13;
implementation assistance needs, the contract of the Consultant might be extended, subject to prior review and&#13;
approval of the NBK and the World Bank, in consultation with SPC and MOE.&#13;
25.   Advisor Activities.&#13;

arrangement of implementation unit staff participation in, suitable training seminars abroad. The Consultants&#13;
will also provide brief ad-hoc instruction to the technical staff of counterpart agencies as will be needed to&#13;
ensure timely procurement and adequate contract execution, especially on the procedures to be followed in&#13;
conducting tenders, evaluating bids, and negotiating contracts.&#13;
26.    Reporting by the Consultant. The Consultant will provide to the three concerned agencies and the&#13;
World Bank an inception report after one month of work on this assignment; a progress report after each&#13;

agencies (NBK, SPC, and MOE, as well as the Ministry of Finance) in two Russian and one English copies,&#13;
respectively, and to the World Bank in two English copies.&#13;
27.    Consultant Qualifications. The Consultant will be chosen chiefly on the basis of the demonstrated&#13;
personal qualifications of the three field advisors.  The experts shall have substantial experience in&#13;

procedures. In the case of all three advisors, Russian language skills would be highly appreciated but are not&#13;
indispensable.&#13;
28.   Inputs. The Consultant contract will cover:&#13;
* consultant fees including overhead;&#13;
* international and local flights, accommodation, and living expenses;&#13;
* interpretation, translation, and operational assistance;&#13;
* office equipment of no more than US$ 40,000 for the personal use of the advisors during their visits to&#13;

be concluded prior to Board presentation of the Loan.&#13;
31.   The funding of the Consultant contract (for one year of service) shall not exceed US$715,000.&#13;
32.    Further Sub-Components not Covered by the Consultant Contract. The Loan and PPF would also&#13;

            services for the defensive restructuring and privatization
            of distressed large enterprises, or for their liquidation;
            and 3) transfer modern market economic know-how to
            enterprise managers through a program of highly structured
            study tours. In the financial sector, the project will
            support: 1) advice for the start-up and operation of a debt
            resolution institution to force the restructuring and
            resolve the debts of up to forty insolvent enterprises that
            burden the banks, state budget, and other creditors most
            severely; 2) institutional development programs for two
            promising medium-size banks and restructuring programs for
            two large, formerly specialized banks, consisting of
            intensive three-year assistance by foreign banks and of
            equipment and software for bank automation; 3) strengthening
            of prudential bank supervision through on-the-job training
            of bank examiners, with increasing specialization on problem
            banks; and 4) the long-term investments for a new domestic
            payment system aimed at, inter alia, same-day finality of
            settlements and real time processing of high value transactions.
