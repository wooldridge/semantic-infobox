-PATTERNS OF BARRIERS TO TRADE IN SWEDEN: A STUDY IN THE THEORY OF PROTECTION&#13;
This work in progress report is part of an inquiry being undertaken&#13;
by the World Bank in conjunction with scholars from twelve industrial&#13;
countries into the penetration of the markets of industrial countries by&#13;
exports of manufactures from developing countries.       The project seeks to&#13;
establish the shares of industrial country markets held by the developing&#13;
countries,  changes in such shares in the 1970s,      and why they vary among&#13;
industry groups and countries. The aim is to assist developing and industrial&#13;
countries to improve their policies through a better understanding of trade&#13;
patterns and protectionist pressures.&#13;
This paper studies the determinants of the inter-industry pattern of&#13;
tariffs, non-tariff barriers to trade and domestic subsidies in Sweden, in the&#13;
light of different hypotheses about causes of protection.       The statistical&#13;
results show that Swedish nominal and effective tariffs protect labor&#13;
intensive industries in which protection is concentrated in large plants, that&#13;
are not intensive in the use of skilled labor and research and development&#13;
(R&amp;D).  The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the general goal&#13;
of trade policy is to diversify the industrial structure by compensating for&#13;
high comparative costs. Quantitative restrictions on imports follow much the&#13;
same pattern, but subsidized industries are less homogenous.&#13;

1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
The trend towards increasing protectionism in most industrial&#13;
countries has stimulated interest in the analysis of protection.     To be able&#13;
to influence policy it is important to understand the factors and mechanisms&#13;
behind protection.&#13;
This paper is a study of the structure and development of protection&#13;
in Sweden. Protection is taken not only to mean import restrictions, but also&#13;
various subsidies to internationally competing industries.      Because of -the&#13;
scarcity of data the analysis is, however, focused on import restrictions, and&#13;
the econometric analysis treats only tariffs.&#13;
One objective of the study is to analyze why some industries, but not&#13;
others, have been granted protection.    The explanation is sought in terms of&#13;
differences in general characteristics of the production process, of the&#13;
market and of the industrial structure.     Section 2 gives a short survey of&#13;
some of the theories that explain protection, while the econometric analysis&#13;
is presented in Section 3.      Section 4 contains an interpretation of the&#13;
statistical results in terms of the theoretical models in the light of&#13;
additional historical and institutional information about Swedish trade and&#13;
industrial policy.     Other  import  restrictions  and  subsidies are briefly&#13;
surveyed in Sections 5 and 6.&#13;
2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND&#13;
The existing structure of protection against imports in a country can&#13;
be seen as a result of several factors, including:&#13;
-   the need for protection in different industries, i.e. the degree of&#13;
import    competition,   which    depends    on   the    international&#13;
competitiveness of the industry in question;&#13;
-   the incentives and the capacity by producers and/or labor associated&#13;
with the industry to further their economic interests through the&#13;
political system;&#13;
-   the goals of national economic policy, and the sensitivity of policy&#13;
makers to claims for protection from different political groups.&#13;
There has lately been a great deal of interest in empirical studies&#13;
explaining the structure of protection in a country in terms of differences in&#13;
industry characteristics, according to a theory of protection based on the&#13;
theory of public choice.    We will make no attempt to survey the literature&#13;
here, nor to present the theories in detail (for a fuller treatment see Caves&#13;
(1976), Anderson (1978, 1979) and Baldwin (1978)). The theory is based on the&#13;
welfare maximization behavior of producers seeking protection, and of&#13;
politicians offering protection to them in return for political support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Because of the high costs in relation to the benefits for consumers&#13;
in obtaining information about tariffs and in resisting them, the tariff&#13;
structure reflects mainly producers- interests. The greater the incentive for&#13;
seeking protection, and thus the demand for it, from an industry, and/or the&#13;
greater the propensity to grant protection to it, the greater the rate of&#13;
protection for its product will be.    The demand for protection will in turn&#13;
depend on the economic gains that can be obtained (or the losses avoided) by&#13;
protection.&#13;
The main conclusions of the theory is that we would expect the rate&#13;
of protection in an industry to be higher, the higher is:&#13;
- the labor intensity measured as labor's share of value added&#13;
(Anderson 1978), or the inverse of value added per worker (Caves&#13;
1976).   This is because    'labor has the votes" and the political&#13;
benefit of supplying protection to labor intensive industries will&#13;
thus be great;&#13;
- the degree of industry concentration, as measured by the share of&#13;
sales of the (n) biggest firms (for alternative variables see Caves&#13;
(1976) and Helleiner (1977)). Since the tariff is in a sense a&#13;
"public good", its benefits are enjoyed by all firms in the industry,&#13;
irrespective of their share in the cost of obtaining it. Hence, an&#13;
industry consisting of a large number of small firms will face a&#13;
serious "free rider" problem that will make it difficult to raise&#13;
funds for lobbying for protection;&#13;
-   the hypothetical free trade import share of the market:     the larger&#13;
the  import   share,  the  greater   are  the  potential   gains  from&#13;
protection;&#13;
and the lower is&#13;
- the average wage (Anderson 1979) as well as the level of education&#13;
and/or the proportion of skilled personnel in the labor force&#13;
(Baldwin 1978).   It can be argued that it is politically easier to&#13;
motivate protection on grounds of "fairness" for such industries. In&#13;
addition,   low  wage,   unskilled  workers   have   probably  greater&#13;
difficulty in finding new jobs;&#13;
- the rate of growth of production and employment, since declining&#13;
industries have a greater incentive to seek protection.&#13;
These theories assume no specific goals for the government forming&#13;
the industrial policy (other than remaining in office). In contrast, another&#13;
approach, which we shall call the National Policy model (Caves 1976), is based&#13;
on the idea that there exists a single "national" preference function, and&#13;
that the existing structure of protection reflects an attempt to maximize&#13;
it. The arguments of such a function, i.e. the goals of economic policy could&#13;
be of a different kind. Certainly, it includes maximization of aggregate real&#13;
income. As is well known, in a perfect economy this would imply free trade.&#13;
Consequently, in explaining protection motivated by this goal only, one would&#13;
look  for   different  forms  of  market   distortions.     Since  most  market&#13;
imperfections are probably caused by domestic distortions, and since it has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_3-&#13;
been shown that the best policy in such a case generally implies the use of&#13;
subsidies and/or taxes rather than import restrictions, it might seem as&#13;
though the widespread use of tariffs and quotas cannot be explained by the&#13;
efficiency goal only. However, as Corden (1974) points out, if the raising of&#13;
fiscal revenue is costly this may restrict the use of measures involving the&#13;
public budget, in favor of tariffs.&#13;
But other than income maximization goals are also relevant for&#13;
industrial policy.    An additional goal is income distribution.     It has been&#13;
argued (Corden 1974) that the social preference function is likely to be&#13;
"conservative", i.e. preferences are strongly biased against any significant&#13;
and rapid reduction of the incomes of any group.        Import restrictions will&#13;
then protect mostly "senescent industries", and industrial policy will be&#13;
strongly adverse to rapid structural change.&#13;
By taking account of uncertainty another argument can be introduced&#13;
into the preference function beside the level and distribution of income,&#13;
namely the variance in expected real income, i.e. in the amount of goods&#13;
available for consumption.    One source of uncertainty in the case of an open&#13;
economy is the risk of the import supply being cut off, by acts of nature or&#13;
political causes. If the policy makers dislike risk, the policy choice in a&#13;
certain sector might be between inefficient but riskless domestic production&#13;
(provided of course that the risk of domestic disturbances of supply is&#13;
negligible) and imports obtainable at lower resource cost but with the&#13;
possibility of being interrupted.&#13;
Against the income maximization goal, that by itself would imply free&#13;
trade, there stands the risk factor, implying a higher degree of self-&#13;
sufficiency.   The magnitude of the latter factor depends on the likelihood of&#13;
an import cut-off, and on the consequences of such an event, which in turn has&#13;
to do with the substitution possibilities in consumption (or use in&#13;
production) of the product.     These factors obviously vary between products,&#13;
and they cannot be quantified in any simple way.&#13;
Including uncertainty with respect to import supply results in a&#13;
general tendency to use trade and industrial policy in such a way as to get a&#13;
more diversified industrial structure than would be the case under free&#13;
trade.  We note that as the distortion lies in the fact that the private cost&#13;
of imports is lower than its social cost (by an appropriate risk premium) the&#13;
optimal policy in this case is a tariff, and not a subsidy.&#13;
This variant of the National Policy model we shall call the&#13;
Diversification model.     The risk argument is certainly not the only one&#13;
leading to a policy of industrial diversification.       Nationalistic arguments&#13;
are often used against dependence on imports and in favor of a "balanced",&#13;
i.e. more diversified, industry (Caves 1976).&#13;
We will argue that it is likely that the national preference function&#13;
has properties implying that protection is used mainly to ascertain a&#13;
satisfactory degree of diversification of the domestic economic structure.&#13;
Taken to the extreme, this would mean that the structure of protection should&#13;
be prohibitive, that is, it should compensate exactly for comparative&#13;
disadvantage, i.e. for low international competitiveness due to high costs of&#13;
production.   This, of course, is the idea that lies behind "the scientific&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
tariff".    The existing tariff structure could thus be explained by the&#13;
potential free trade position of the home industry on the domestic market.&#13;
Since this is not observable, the tariff structure can alternatively be&#13;
explained by the factors determining comparative costs and international&#13;
competitiveness.&#13;
Let us suppose, in the spirit of the neoclassical theory of&#13;
international trade, that the intensity of use in an activity of different&#13;
factors of production is important in determining the relative cost.      For a&#13;
two-factor model with production functions of the Cobb-Douglas type, and with&#13;
no intermediate goods, it can be shown (Travis 1972) that the unit cost in an&#13;
industry, relative to the cost abroad, will depend only on the capital&#13;
intensity and the relative level of efficiency of the industry in question (at&#13;
given factor prices and exchange rate).     If the domestic wage/capital price&#13;
ratio is higher than abroad, the more labor intensive the process the higher&#13;
its relative cost will be, and thus the worse its competitive position.      On&#13;
the home market, however, this cost disadvantage can be compensated for by an&#13;
appropriate tariff. In fact, the tariff rate that is needed to stop imports&#13;
will be a simple function of the capital intensity. If the immediate goal of&#13;
industrial policy is diversification, then the rate of protection in different&#13;
industries would be correlated with the intensity in use of the country's&#13;
scarce (i.e. expensive) factor (see also Lundberg 1976).&#13;
When we extend the result to a multi-factor world, it can be shown&#13;
(see Appendix C) that comparative costs in any industry, and thus the&#13;
necessary rate of protection, will be a linear function of the cost shares of&#13;
different factors, provided that input coefficients are given and factor&#13;
prices equal in all sectors.    The results could also be extended to a model&#13;
with tradeable intermediate goods.      In that case,   the rate of effective&#13;
protection necessary to stop imports will be a simple function of the&#13;
proportions in which factors are used directly in a production process.&#13;
Should the intermediate goods be non-tradeable, on the other hand, the&#13;
relation between factor intensities and protection will refer to the nominal&#13;
rate of protection and the total--direct plus indirect--use of factors.&#13;
At a given relative cost the domestic market share and thus the need&#13;
for protection on the home market, will be influenced by transport cost.     In&#13;
general we expect the tariff to be lower, cet. par., for products for which&#13;
transport costs are important in relation to costs of production, and which&#13;
thus enjoy "natural" protection in the domestic market.&#13;
The National Policy model may not only contain a general tendency to&#13;
diversification and decreased international specialization, but also express a&#13;
collective preference for a certain industrial structure. Certain activities&#13;
may, in the opinion of policy makers, generate a social value in addition to&#13;
the market value of their products (Johnson 1965).&#13;
If some industries are protected for this reason, the question is&#13;
what type of industries these are likely to be.    We will argue here that such&#13;
industries tend to be those with intensive use of advanced technology, on the&#13;
grounds that such technology-producing activities are widely believed to give&#13;
substantial positive external effects on technical progress in the rest of the&#13;
economy.   Whether this is true or not does not really matter:       an equally&#13;
important motive might be that such production adds to national prestige. We&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
should then expect a high rate of protection for high-technology industries.&#13;
This we will call the Technology hypothesis.&#13;
3. STATISTICAL RESULTS&#13;
An analysis of the determinants of the structure of protection is met&#13;
by many problems and questions, such as:&#13;
1.   Some forms of protection, and/or their effects, are very difficult to&#13;
quantify; this is especially true of some non-tariff barriers to&#13;
trade.&#13;
2.   Should all forms of protection be combined in a single measure, or&#13;
should different forms be analyzed separately?&#13;
3.   Should levels or changes in protection be studied?&#13;
4.   Should existing protection be explained by variables reflecting&#13;
current economic conditions? Do we deal with "equilibrium"&#13;
structures of protection?&#13;
5.   How can we account for interdependences among variables, for&#13;
instance that the import share of the market affects the rate&#13;
of protection, and at the same time is affected by it?&#13;
In addition, we have to choose a suitable method of analysis. In our&#13;
case data on a sufficiently disaggregated level to permit a meaningful use of&#13;
econometric methods are available only for tariffs.&#13;
We will thus treat each form of protection separately. We will study&#13;
nominal as well as effective tariffs. The tariff data used in the study are&#13;
the Swedish tariff rates before (1959) and after (1972) the Kennedy Round.&#13;
Since the latter reflect multilateral tariff negotiation, the 1959 tariffs in&#13;
our opinion are better suited to an analysis of the Swedish trade policy.&#13;
In thestudy we use the following explanatory variables:&#13;
I    Share of imports in consumption.&#13;
IN   Share of net imports (i.e. imports minus exports) in consumption.&#13;
LT   Total labor intensity, measured as the share of direct plus indirect&#13;
labor cost in total cost. 1/&#13;
LD   Direct labor intensity:   share of labor cost in value added.&#13;
Lu   Skill intensity:   share of administrative and technical personnel in&#13;
labor force.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
V    Value added per employed, as a measure of total (human plus physical)&#13;
capital per man.&#13;
U    Unit value, as an indicator of the importance of transport costs. 1/&#13;
C    Share of supply for final consumption, i.e. not used at inputs. 2/&#13;
F    Share of R&amp;D in total cost.&#13;
R    Raw material   content:    share  of direct   plus. indirect  costs  of&#13;
domestic raw materials.&#13;
S    Share of employment for plants with more than 500 employees.&#13;
The dependent variables are the nominal (t) and effective (T) rates&#13;
of tariff protection, excluding preferential treatment (i.e. towards non-&#13;
European Free Trade Area (EFTA) countries), in force in 1959 and 1972.       The&#13;
study covers 42 industrial sectors of manufacturing industry, excluding&#13;
foodstuffs  and  raw  materials.    The data do not     cover all sectors,    as&#13;
comparable   data  for  the   various  variables   for  all   sectors  were  not&#13;
available. The computed rates are listed in Appendix Table B.&#13;
Variables LT, LD, Lu, C and R, as well as data for computing&#13;
effective tariffs, are taken from an input-output table for Sweden in 1957&#13;
(Hoglund &amp; Werin 1964), while I, IN, V, U and S are from Swedish trade and&#13;
industrial statistics (SOS Industri, SOS Utrikeshandel). Comparable data for&#13;
industry structure are only available for plants (S) and not for firms.&#13;
If the goal of protection is diversification, tariffs can be&#13;
explained by comparative costs.    If intermediate goods are non-tradeable, the&#13;
relevant  measure  of  protection  is  the nominal   tariff.    The  competitive&#13;
position is then determined by total labor intensity (LT) and the cumulated&#13;
content of domestic raw materials (R).     If intermediate goods are perfectly&#13;
tradeable, protection should be measured by effective tariffs.      In this case&#13;
comparative costs are determined by the direct use of factors only (see&#13;
Appendix C).   Sweden is a small open economy with free trade oriented policy,&#13;
where most intermediate goods are tradeable at given world market prices.&#13;
Thus, it seems that the relation between effective tariffs and direct labor&#13;
intensity (LD) should be more relevant to the study than the relation between&#13;
nominal tariffs and total labor intensity.       We shall also expect to find&#13;
tariff escalation, i.e. that nominal tariffs will be lower for products mostly&#13;
used as inputs than for final goods.&#13;
Since the skill (Lu) and R&amp;D (F) intensities as well as the plant&#13;
size variable (S) do refer to the last stage of production only, i.e. they are&#13;
not cumulated, they should primarily affect effective protection.        If unit&#13;
value (U) can be accepted as a proxy for transport cost, it should affect both&#13;
1/ Low value per ton reflects a bulky product, for which transport costs can&#13;
be expected to be important, and thus the need for protection low.&#13;
2/ This share will be high for products at later stages of processing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
(t) and (T).   The role of the import share variables (I, IN) is complicated:&#13;
they are determined by the other independent variables, as well as by&#13;
tariffs. One would expect I to be relevant measure for the need for tariff&#13;
protection:   we have used I and IN as alternatives.      Since value added per&#13;
employee (V) can be interpreted as a measure of human plus non-human capital&#13;
intensity, it could replace LD and Lu.&#13;
We use regression analysis to test hypotheses concerning the role of&#13;
the different explanatory variables in determining the tariff structure.      If&#13;
those variables could all be considered to be independent, OLS regression of&#13;
tariffs on all other variables would be a proper form of analysis.      However,&#13;
according to the diversification hypothesis, tariffs are determined primarily&#13;
by the domestic market position, which in turn is determined by the indicators&#13;
of comparative cost, i.e. factor proportions.     Thus it would be incorrect to&#13;
include the import share in the equation together with comparative cost&#13;
indicators:   one or the other has to be chosen.      However, as most of these&#13;
variables, as we shall see, can be interpreted in different ways, i.e. both as&#13;
indicators of comparative costs and as indicators of other circumstances&#13;
affecting demand or supply for protection, we have calculated regressions both&#13;
with and without the import share variable.&#13;
Another problem is that tariffs may influence the other variables.&#13;
An obvious example is that the higher the tariff the lower the import share is&#13;
likely to be (in relation to its free trade value).     In this case OLS results&#13;
will be biased.    We have tried to correct for this by using 2SLS estimating&#13;
techniques in a model consisting of two equations, in which two endogenous&#13;
variables, namely the tariff rate and net import share, are determined by each&#13;
other and in addition by other explanatory variables out of the set on p 7.&#13;
As shown in Appendix Table A5, the explanatory variables are inter-&#13;
correlated in varying degree.     For instance, skill and R&amp;D intensities are&#13;
positively related, while correlation between labor intensity and value added&#13;
per employee is negative.     This means that the estimated coefficient for a&#13;
variable will be affected by the presence of other variables.        In Appendix&#13;
Tables Al-A4 we show the results of several variants of the basic regressions.&#13;
The main results are listed in Table 1.&#13;

According to our data, industries with a weak competitive position&#13;
tend to obtain more import protection than others.         However, contrary to&#13;
expectation, it is not the domestic market position, as measured by the import&#13;
penetration ratio (I), that seems to be the relevant variable, but rather the&#13;
overall competitive position, measured by the net import ratio (IN).        Both&#13;
variables show positive coefficients in all equations (except 2SLS estimates&#13;
for t72), but t-values for I are in all cases lower than for IN, and mostly&#13;
insignificant, whereas IN in most cases is significant.      The 2SLS estimates&#13;
for IN are generally lower than the OLS coefficients (in fact for t72 they are&#13;
negative).&#13;

The data do not support the hypothesis that "foot-loose" industries,&#13;
whose products have a high value per ton, tend to obtain more protection than&#13;
industries whose products are bulky and sensitive to transport costs, and thus&#13;
enjoy a natural protection of the home market.     The coefficients for (U) are&#13;
mostly negative, contrary to the hypothesis, but are in no case significant.&#13;
This result might be explained by the fact that unit cost is a bad proxy for&#13;
transport costs.&#13;
Table 1 shows that labor intensive industries (products) tend to have&#13;
a high rate of import protection. This relationship is valid for direct labor&#13;
(LD) and effective tariffs (T) as well as for total labor (LT) and nominal&#13;
tariffs (t).   For nominal tariffs it has been weakened over time, since the&#13;
coefficients for labor intensity in 1972 are lower than in 1959, and mostly&#13;
insignificant.   For effective tariffs the coefficient for LD is more or less&#13;
unchanged. There is no systematic difference between OLS and 2SLS estimates.&#13;
Contrary to expectations industries that are intensive in use of&#13;
technology, as measured by the share of R&amp;D expenditure (F), tend to have low&#13;
tariff protection (T). If, then, there is a collective preference for high-&#13;
technology production that motivates protection for it, this protection is&#13;
evidently not given in the form of tariffs.    Alternatively, it is possible to&#13;
interpret (F) as a variable influencing comparative costs of Swedish industry;&#13;
in that case a negative sign would imply comparative advantage in R&amp;D&#13;
intensive production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
Industries that use skilled labor intensively tend to have low tariff&#13;
protection (T). Because of the strong correlation between skill intensity and&#13;
R&amp;D (0.68) the effect of (Lu) tends to disappear, but if (F) is excluded (Lu)&#13;
is strongly significant.    We have also substituted the variable value added&#13;
per employed (V), as a measure of human plus physical capital intensity, for&#13;
the variables (LD) and (Lu). The coefficients for (V) are mostly negative but&#13;
not significant, and the explanatory values are lower than for (LD) and (Lu).&#13;
The share of employment of big plants (S) seems to be strongly&#13;
positively related to tariff rates (T, t).     This variable can be interpreted&#13;
as an indicator of economies of scale in production.      However, it is likely&#13;
that the share of employment for big plants is correlated with the market&#13;
share  of  big   firms:    thus  (S)  will  also  be   a  proxy  for  industrial&#13;
concentration. Raw material intensive industries, finally, tended to have low&#13;
nominal tariffs, in particular in 1972.&#13;
The 2SLS regressions do not differ significantly from the OLS&#13;
results.   In most cases the coefficients do not change much.         Changes in&#13;
coefficients seem to be more related to changes in the set of explanatory&#13;
variables in the equation than to change in estimation method.         The total&#13;
explanatory values of the regressions are rather low.     This means that other&#13;
variables as well as those used in this analysis would have to be included for&#13;
a more robust explanation of the Swedish tariff structure. Effective tariffs&#13;
do not perform better than nominal tariffs.    We note that the variables T and&#13;
t are highly correlated (0.89).&#13;
To sum up, we can say that the rate of nominal tariff protection&#13;
seems to be high for labor intensive final products (i.e. not used as inputs)&#13;
with a low raw material content, and with weak overall competitive position.&#13;
The strong influence of the variable C indicates that a considerable&#13;
proportion of the differences in nominal tariffs between products is explained&#13;
by the practice of tariff escalation, i.e. that tariffs tend to be low for raw&#13;
materials and semiprocessed goods.&#13;
Our results indicate that industries which have a high rate of&#13;
effective tariff protection tend to be labor intensive (i.e. with low physical&#13;
capital to labor ratios), concentrated in large plants, spend little on R&amp;D,&#13;
and have a weak competitive position (as measured by IN).      They also tend to&#13;
use little skilled labor and to have low value added per employee (though&#13;
these variables are not significant).&#13;
We have also analyzed the determinants of tariff changes, which in&#13;
the period 1959-72 consist mainly of the Kennedy round tariff reductions (we&#13;
do not deal with the tariff preferences granted to EFTA members).         Tariff&#13;
protection was excluded from general tariff reductions in industries with&#13;
rapidly  weakening   domestic  market   positions  during   1959-67,  since  the&#13;
coefficient for the import share is significantly positive for nominal as well&#13;
as for effective tariffs (see Table 3). We note, however, that this relation,&#13;
in contrast to the case of the tariff levels, holds for the variable I, while&#13;
the net import share is insignificant.&#13;

Table 3 also indicates that nominal tariffs have been lowered&#13;
especially on products that are both labor intensive and skill intensive, and&#13;
which tend to be used as inputs in production. The changes in effective&#13;
tariffs show no systematic pattern at all.       The results, however, must be&#13;
carefully interpreted, because the tariff rates in 1959 and 1972 are not&#13;
strictly comparable (see Appendix B).&#13;
4. INTERPRETATIONS OF THE RESULTS&#13;
In order to be able to make any predictions whatsoever about the&#13;
determinants   of   the  Swedish   tariff  structure   on   the  basis   of  the&#13;
diversification hypothesis, we must at first establish which factors determine&#13;
the comparative advantage of the Swedish economy.        According to empirical&#13;
studies, Swedish industry seems to have had a comparative advantage in&#13;
physical capital intensive production, particularly in the 1950s, although the&#13;
importance of this factor has probably declined, and later on in production&#13;
using skilled labor intensively (Carlsson &amp; Ohlsson 1976), Ohlsson (1973 and&#13;
1976).    Studies  of  trade with developing    countries  indicate comparative&#13;
advantage in products intensive in physcial plus human capital i.e. with high&#13;
value added per employee (Carlsson &amp; Sundstrom 1973).&#13;
The predictions given by different theories of protection about the&#13;
relationships between the level of protection and the explanatory variables&#13;
are summarized   in Table 4, together with the results of the econometric&#13;
work.    But  because   the theories  are not   rigorous,   it is difficult 'to&#13;
discriminate  among  them,  since  their  predictions   are very  similar.    In&#13;
particular, it turns out that almost all variables supposed to affect the&#13;
supply and demand for protection through various mechanisms, according to the&#13;
theory of the political market for protection, can also be interpreted as&#13;
indicators of comparative costs.&#13;
We have tried to sum up the predictions of different theories in&#13;
Table 4.   This table is not a summary of the literature, but rather our own&#13;
interpretation of the theories, concentrating on the main ideas. The positive&#13;
sign for labor intensity (LD, LT) and the negative signs for skill intensity&#13;
(Lu) and value added per employed (V) are predicted both by the adding&#13;
machine/interest group theories and by the diversification hypothesis.       The&#13;
influence of the scale/concentration variables is predicted only by the&#13;
interest group hypothesis.    An effect of R&amp;D intensity is predicted only by&#13;
the technology hypothesis, but with the wrong sign.     It is a striking result&#13;
that the single common prediction of all theories, namely a positive sign for&#13;
import penetration (I), fails to be significant, and that the relationship in&#13;
the data concerns the net import (IN).&#13;

The'central predictions of the.adding machine and.the interest groups&#13;
hypotheses",  namely  the  influence, of' value  added  per   employee  and  of&#13;
concentration, are confirmed by our data, although the former relationship is&#13;
rather, weak.   But our results. are also, as far as we can- see, broadly&#13;
cons,istent wi-th, the. idea that' tariffs; are set- to meet an overall objective of&#13;
diversification, of: industry,, in, so; far" as the industries (products.)' with high&#13;
comparative costs,, according, to empirical studies of Sweden's comparative&#13;
advantage, seem to have a high rate of'effective (nominal) protection.&#13;
The-development of the effective tariff structure during 1959-72 does&#13;
not, confirm any of the- main theories of protection in Table 4, with the&#13;
exception   that  protection. has. been- kept   intact   for  sectors" with   a&#13;

tariffs:,, some of the' resul.ts- (in particular the- negative sign. of- LT)Y seem,to&#13;
contradict, our' previous conclusions.,&#13;
The, other  variant- of   the  National  Policyr model,  as  we, have&#13;
interpreted: it,, namely the: technology hypothesis:,. fails to get any support&#13;
whatsoever from our data on the tariff structure-.&#13;
I:n. interpreting our econometric" work,, we have to consider' if our&#13;
r.esults'. and" the: conc-lusions. drawn, from them are consistent with other&#13;
information'  that, we- have  about- the   formation" of  the  Swedish   tariff&#13;
structure., The 19,5,.ttariff structure was the resul't of a.thorough revision of&#13;
the, Swedish tariffs,, to bring them into line with the changed structure of&#13;
comparative costs' and' international competitiveness: in. the Swedish, economy&#13;
that had taken, place, since, the, pr.e-1914, period-,, when, the former structure had&#13;
been establi.shed-.  The re.visi'on: was, made- with the. expli-cit recognition of the&#13;
concept of effective' tariff's':  in fact the Tariff Commission, as a first step.&#13;
calculated a. set- of nominal: tariffs, to provide an equal. rate of' effective&#13;
protection for- alt, industries.,  Sec-ondly,. this "uniform" tariff level was&#13;
adjusted upwards' considerably. for sectors, facing, strong actual and/or&#13;
potential import- co.mpettition. (since actual trade was still to some extent&#13;
constrained by' quantitative restrictions), and' downwards for other industries&#13;
not expected" to suffer" from. import- competition (SOU 1956:14' and 1956.:'15&#13;
Tulltaxa).   In,this connection hearings with industry.? representatives,seem to&#13;
have played'an important role.&#13;
General'ly, tar:iffs. were lowered for engineering' goods and abolished&#13;
on pure export products.,. such' as. paper, and' raised. on, consumer goods such as&#13;
clothes and footwear.  Whereas the former Swedish tari'ffs had" been designed to&#13;
protect the newly growing industries,, in particular the engi'neering industry,&#13;
the revision was. mainly a d"efensi've step to protect old industries that had&#13;
lost comparative advantage,. or- had beent sheltered' during the 1930s and World&#13;
War  II.    It  can  thus; be: seen, as  a. part   of  a policy   with' greater&#13;
diversification as" its immediate goal.   We should then expect. the tariffs to&#13;
reflect the (actual or forecasted)'"competitive, posi,t-ion and relative costs for&#13;
industries.&#13;
Several  factors,  complicate  the   interpretation  of  the   Swedish&#13;
structure of protection in terms of models using the concept of a political&#13;
market for protection.    Protection measures are created on several levels&#13;
rather than by the interplay of national politicians with lobbying groups&#13;
alone  (Verreydt &amp; Waelbroeck 1980).      Since some protective measures are&#13;
initiated not by politicians but by the administrative bodies, it is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
necessary, as Messerline (1980) points out, to study the behavior of&#13;
"bureaucrats", as an additional type of actor.&#13;
There are also other problems in using such models in an explanation&#13;
of Swedish trade policy.    It could be argued that the national policy model&#13;
might be especially appropriate for an analysis of the structure of protection&#13;
in small open economies, such as those of the Scandinavian countries.&#13;
Firstly, there is a high degree of centralization of labor unions.     There is&#13;
also  a comparatively   high  concentration  of  ownership  of   industry.   In&#13;
addition, regional governments and regional interest groups are less powerful&#13;
in relation to the central government than in many other countries. For these&#13;
reasons it may be difficult for workers and capital owners in a given industry&#13;
to form powerful groups that can pursue their interests effectively, against&#13;
the  general  consumer  interest,  inside  the  administration,   the political&#13;
parties and the trade unions.      Agriculture is an obvious exception; here&#13;
producers have succeeded in obtaining strong political support and massive&#13;
protection.&#13;
The development of trade policy in a small country is likely to be&#13;
influenced by actual and potential policies of other countries to a very&#13;
considerable extent. A small open economy is thus not only a price taker but&#13;
also a "policy taker", in the sense that it has little power to influence the&#13;
contents of multilateral agreements.    The international influence is obvious&#13;
in the historical development of Swedish trade policy from the beginning of&#13;
industrialization, for it closely follows international trends and cycles of&#13;
more liberal trade or greater protectionism.&#13;
A small open economy is extremely vulnerable to retaliation.      This&#13;
is, no doubt, an important factor in explaining the relatively limited use of&#13;
import restrictions in Swedish post-war industrial policy.     In fact, fear of&#13;
retaliation is a common argument against proposals for restrictions.        The&#13;
recent debate about subsidies to certain export industries makes clear that&#13;
policy makers as well as firms are fully aware of such risks.      Furthermore,&#13;
almost all Swedish import restrictions in recent years have been directed&#13;
towards those exporters which have the least power to retaliate, namely the&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
It could be argued that in a small economy the necessity of taking&#13;
part in the international division of labor is obvious, and forms the core of&#13;
attitudes towards trade policy. The strong posture in favor of international&#13;
trade and specialization repeatedly taken by the LO, the central body of&#13;
Swedish trade unions, is an example.&#13;
The benefits of international trade and specialization have often&#13;
been stressed by the industry organizations, where the interests of big and&#13;
strongly export-oriented or transnational firms are prominent. Until recently&#13;
there was virtually no influential group in any political party openly&#13;
advocating  generally  protectionist  views.    There  was,   for  instance,  no&#13;
articulate political opposition against the free trade agreements with EFTA&#13;
and later with the EC.    The debate centered around possible consequences for&#13;
neutrality and freedom for national economic policy of a membership in an&#13;
organization with supra-national powers, not around the question of free trade&#13;
as such.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
For these reasons permanent protection (as opposed to temporary&#13;
adjustment assistance) has been motivated only as an exception from generally&#13;
free trade rules, and only in cases which can be clearly stated as in need of&#13;
protection according to some general principle, accepted by the public, such&#13;
as national security, national price, or the need to support technological&#13;
development and the like.&#13;
5. THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF NON-TARIFF BARRIERS TO TRADE&#13;
Due to lack of data, a meaningful econometric analysis cannot be&#13;
undertaken of the determinants of other forms of protection than tariffs.&#13;
However, qualitative judgement can examine the extent to which other barriers&#13;
to trade fall into the same pattern as tariff protection.&#13;
Quantitative import restrictions in Sweden on imports from market&#13;
economies have been dominated by export restriction agreements on textiles and&#13;
clothing from developing countries introduced in the mid-60s and successively&#13;
extended to new products and countries.     In addition there has also been a&#13;
temporary global quota on footwear.&#13;
According to Table 5, the industries protected by quantitative&#13;
restrictions in the late   60s and  70s in Sweden:&#13;
-   had been the most stagnant with regard to employment in the 1960s;&#13;
-   had the largest increase in import penetration;&#13;
-   were among the most labor intensive; and&#13;
-   were also among those industries with the highest level of import&#13;
penetration in the end of the 1960s.&#13;
Furthermore,   these   industries  are   also   characterized  by   low&#13;
expenditure on R&amp;D, they have a low level of average wage, do not use much&#13;
skilled labor, and they were dominated by small firms and small plants.&#13;
Except for the last point we could say that quantitative import restrictions&#13;
show the same industry pattern as tariffs, namely, that they protect&#13;
technically unsophisticated consumer products, intensive in use of labor,&#13;
especially unskilled labor, which are stagnating or contracting as a&#13;
consequence of strong and rapidly increasing import competition.&#13;
The import quotas on textiles, clothing and footwear, together with&#13;
other forms of protection granted to these industries in the 70s (such as&#13;
subsidies to wages, to export promotion etc), were explicitly mainly motivated&#13;
by the argument that import penetration in these industries would otherwise&#13;
exceed a tolerable level which was determined by the need to keep some&#13;
production capacity in case of a blockade of imports. This indicates that for&#13;
some products, classified as "necessities" by some definition, there would&#13;
exist some critical upper limit of import penetration, that would trigger off&#13;
protective measures.   This critical level is not, of course, necessarily the&#13;
same for all products.&#13;

The textiles, clothing and footwear industries have continued to&#13;
decline  during   the  -70s,  in  spite  of   import  restrictions  and  import&#13;
penetration has increased further.     On the other hand, the share of these&#13;
industries- exports in production has increased, as a result of intra-industry&#13;
specialization.  This of course makes the definition and meaning of a minimum&#13;
level of self-sufficiency in an industry more complicated.&#13;
Swedish import restrictions have gradually been reduced during the&#13;
post World War II period, but at the same time they have become increasingly&#13;
concentrated on a few countries and products.      Before the formation of the&#13;
European trade blocs, Sweden was a low-tariff country, together with the other&#13;
Nordic  countries,  Germany,  the Netherlands   and Belgium.    Average tariff&#13;
protection has since then been reduced because free trade in industrial&#13;
products has been extended to an increasing number of countries.          This,&#13;
however, leaves discrimination towards the rest.&#13;
Secondly, the dispersion of tariffs has increased. A low dispersion&#13;
means uniform tariff protection. The coefficient of variation, computed from&#13;
the rates in Appendix B, is:&#13;
1959      1972&#13;
Nominal tariffs      0.46       0.66&#13;
Effective tariffs     0.69       0.94&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
The Swedish GSP system (introduced in 1972) is open to all developing&#13;
countries.   In 1979 78 countries were included.       It grants a 100% tariff&#13;
preference to imports of all goods included in the system.        Unlike the EC&#13;
system there are no quotas.    However, imports in certain "sensitive" sectors&#13;
are excluded from GSP treatment.     In 1978 total imports from GSP countries&#13;
amounted to 10.1 billion Swedish Kronor (US$2.235 billion).        Of this, 7.5&#13;
billion Swedish Kronor (US$1.660 billion) was already duty free (raw materials&#13;
etc.), and 1.4 billion Swedish Kronor ($USO.310 billion) was excluded from&#13;
GSP.   The latter mainly consisted of textiles, leather and shoes.     The rest,&#13;
1.1 billion Swedish Kronor ($USO.243 billion), was granted GSP treatment.&#13;
Finally, the import quotas are also heavily concentrated in a few products&#13;
(textiles) and developing countries.&#13;
The practice of discrimination in favor of domestic suppliers in&#13;
public procurement is probably widespread, though hard to quantify. Estimates&#13;
for the US by Baldwin (1970) show that the restrictive effect on imports is&#13;
substantial.   Estimates for Sweden using the same technique (Lundberg 1976)&#13;
indicate that the import effects, though smaller, are still of the same order&#13;
as the average industrial tariff. In particular, the effects are likely to be&#13;
important in industries where government procurement is a large part of the&#13;
market.   These industries tend to use advanced technology intensively, as&#13;
measured by the R&amp;D share in sales (Lundberg 1976).     In addition to available&#13;
information on individual cases of discrimination in public procurement, this&#13;
supports   the   hypothesis  that   there   is  a   collective   preference  for&#13;
technological production, and that the protection justified thereby is given&#13;
not by tariffs but by other and more disguised means.&#13;
6. SUBSIDIES&#13;
One of the principles of the Swedish industrial policy during the&#13;
post-war years has been to promote growth in such technology intensive sectors&#13;
as nuclear power, computers and aircraft production.     One form of assistance&#13;
to these industries has been preferential treatment in public procurement, as&#13;
an attempt to create a protected home market.    However, most of these efforts&#13;
have failed.   Some of these failures have been very costly.      The failure to&#13;
secure an export market has been an important cause of failure because the&#13;
home market is too small to sustain production at reasonable cost.&#13;
The main reason for giving assistance to the establishment of such&#13;
industries seems to have been the belief of policy makers in the importance of&#13;
building up domestic technical knowledge in these fields. Thus, the industry&#13;
as well as local politicians and trade unions have been active.           In the&#13;
political decision about the development of a new military aircraft during the&#13;
1980s this decision will determine whether the domestic aircraft producer will&#13;
survive.&#13;
Up to middle of the 1970s the government subsidies, outside&#13;
agriculture, the defence industry and certain other sectors, were probably not&#13;
of any great significance.   During the   70s, however, there has been a marked&#13;
increase in the use of subsidies of various kinds.       Table 6 shows data for&#13;
different forms of government financial assistance to Swedish industry in the&#13;
70s.   The two first columns show assistance not restricted to firms in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
particular sectors or regions.     Examples are the general wage subsidy that&#13;
keeps redundant workers for training within firms, and the subsidies to stock-&#13;
holding, both given in 1976-77. Sectoral assistance is restricted to firms in&#13;
a cetain industry, and regional assistance to firms in certain regions.&#13;
Assistance to industry is given in many different forms, and cannot&#13;
simply be added up.      The main categories are given separately,      but the&#13;
distinctions are not clear-cut.   Some of the loans, and government guarantees&#13;
for loans, are given on terms not differing much from market terms, while for&#13;
some "loans" no repayment at all has been expected.     Only those cases which&#13;
were explicitly intended to be written off are treated as subsidies in Table&#13;
6.&#13;
An addition to (share) capital, mostly in combination with (part)&#13;
nationalization and sometimes with the merger of firms, has been used as an&#13;
alternative to outright subsidies.    In principle, as with loans, the subsidy&#13;
element is difficult to ascertain.    In practice, however, it has mainly been&#13;
used in situations when the firm in question would otherwise have gone&#13;
bankrupt, as a short-run device for preserving jobs.&#13;

Table 6 suggests that it is mainly the sectoral assistance that has&#13;
increased;  regional  assistance  has  almost  remained   unchanged.   Sectoral&#13;
assistance is naturally very unevenly spread among industries. Table 7 shows&#13;
different kinds of assistance per employee in the period 1971-81 (including&#13;
decisions taken for 1980 and 1981) for some industries. The shipyards clearly&#13;
stand out as being by far the most heavily subsidized industry.      Next comes&#13;
textiles and clothing; for the steel and the pulp and paper industries&#13;
assistance is mainly given by loans and capital additions.&#13;

Tables 6 and 7 give rise to several questions.       Firstly, does the&#13;
increased use of sectoral subsidies reflect a change in policy goals, away&#13;
from free trade? Secondly, what explains the choice of policy measures? And&#13;
thirdly, what are the characteristics of the industries that have obtained&#13;
assistance?&#13;
Before answering those questions, we must consider if the figures in&#13;
Table 6 really signify an increase in the level of permanent protection, with&#13;
the same long run intended consequences on industrial structure as tariffs and&#13;
quotas, or if they are merely temporary measures, used to control the speed&#13;
and   consequences  of   an  adjustment   process   towards  a   more  efficient&#13;
structure.   On this point it is not possible to give a definite answer.     The&#13;
motives given, of course, are of a short run character: however, some, though&#13;
not all, of the assistance will presumably be permanent.&#13;
It is possible that political opinion in Sweden has become somewhat&#13;
sceptical of the benefits of free trade, and more sympathetic towards&#13;
protection arguments; many of the latter are being directed against "unfair"&#13;
competition from export zones in developing countries.      However, we believe&#13;
that the common preference for free trade has remained basically unchanged&#13;
within  all  major  political and economic    groups.    The  increased  use of&#13;
subsidies is mainly to be seen as a substitute for an efficient stabilization&#13;
policy. The failure of fiscal, exchange rate and incomes policy to counteract&#13;
foreign and domestic disturbances has left the policy burden to selective&#13;
measures. This is, of course, a very general phenomenon that can be observed&#13;
in most countries from the '30s onward.       At the same time, the potential&#13;
changes in employment were too large to be dealt with by adjustment assistance&#13;
alone.&#13;
Most industry support in Sweden in the '70s has been given in the&#13;
form of domestic subsidies, rather than restrictions on imports. This marks a&#13;
general trend in industrial policy away from restrictions on trade and in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
particular tariffs, toward domestic subsidies.      Secondly, the measures have&#13;
been increasingly selective, i.e. not only discriminating between industries&#13;
and regions   but also selective with respect to firms.        These "marginal"&#13;
subsidies are likely to have the same effects on resource allocation, but they&#13;
are favored for income distribution reasons; i.e. they are less costly for the&#13;
public budget.&#13;
There are many reasons for the trend toward more selective domestic&#13;
subsidies. Firstly, in the -70s some of the problem industries were hurt by&#13;
competition in export markets, and would have benefited very little from&#13;
protection of the domestic market.    An obvious example is forestry, but this&#13;
is also true for shipyards.     Secondly, the use of import restrictions has&#13;
become increasingly circumscribed by global and regional agreements, such as&#13;
the GATT, the EC, etc. The fear of retaliation probably also explains why the&#13;
use of global import restrictions has been limited.       Thirdly, the goals of&#13;
economic policy have become more ambitious.       In particular,   the increased&#13;
stress on the regional dimension, for instance on local labor market&#13;
conditions,  has made increasing selectivity necessary.      The need for more&#13;
differentiated policy measures, finally, has been accentuated by slow economic&#13;
growth and less favorable attitudes toward structural change.&#13;
Insofar as protection for some products could be motivated by the&#13;
existence of domestic distortions--for instance the private costs of the use&#13;
of some factors of production overestimated the social costs--the change from&#13;
import restrictions to domestic subsidies could be seen as an improvement with&#13;
respect to economic efficiency. However, this is not likely to have been the&#13;
main reason.   In some cases, the differential effects on income distribution&#13;
may have weighed in favor of subsidies.&#13;
The industries assisted by domestic subsidies seem to have been less&#13;
homogenous with respect to characteristics of the production process, the&#13;
market and industrial structure, than the industries protected by import&#13;
restrictions.   Some industries, of course, belong to both groups. There are&#13;
the "old" problem industries, like the footwear, the textiles and clothing&#13;
industries, and the manual glass industry.     Of these, footwear and clothing&#13;
are labor intensive while all use standardized techniques and are not&#13;
intensive in skilled labor (except glass) or in R&amp;D. But domestic assistance&#13;
has also been enjoyed by some very capital intensive industries, such as steel&#13;
mills.    However,  the most assisted industry,    shipyards,   is rather labor&#13;
intensive, though mostly in skilled labor, and has had a rapid increase in&#13;
import penetration during the '70s. In addition, both steel and shipyards are&#13;
concentrated in vary large plants.&#13;
The industries in Table 7 face different problems, and have different&#13;
forms of protection, but such a discussion would bring us outside the limits&#13;
of this paper:    for a case study of the shipyards see Hamilton (1980).       A&#13;
common characteristic is, however, that selective assistance has been granted&#13;
in an acute crisis to some or all firms in an industry, with the main&#13;
objective of avoiding (or postponing) very large relative decreases of&#13;
employment in a local or regional labor market. There is a difference between&#13;
"new" and "old" problem industries:    in textiles and footwear, for instance,&#13;
the motives for assistance seem to be more "genuinely protectionist" (a&#13;
minimum level of self-sufficiency), as do the means (tariffs and quotas) than&#13;
in the "new" industries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

7. CONCLUSIONS&#13;
Our statistical results indicate that Swedish effective tariffs seem&#13;
to protect industries that are labor intensive, in particular in the use of&#13;
unskilled labor, produce standardized products using simple technology, as&#13;
measured by a low share of R&amp;D in sales, have a weak overall international&#13;
competitive position, i.e. a high net import share, and are concentrated in&#13;
large plants.   In addition, nominal tariffs are high on final products with a&#13;
low raw material content.    However, the statistical significance is in some&#13;
cases rather low.   Quantitative restrictions on imports have been imposed in&#13;
declining sectors with a high level and/or a high rate of increase of import&#13;
penetration.   Preferences in public procurement seem to be most important in&#13;
sectors with advanced technology. Domestic subsidies have been given both to&#13;
capital intensive and to labor intensive industries.      Subsidized industries&#13;
have generally been characterized by declining profitability, a weakening&#13;
market position, and the size concentration of plants.&#13;
Our statistical results are broadly consistent both with the adding&#13;
machine  and  the interest   group  theories  of protection.     They are also&#13;
consistent with the diversification hypothesis, i.e. that the general goal of&#13;
protection is a more diversified economic structure, and that tariffs are&#13;
calculated to compensate for high comparative costs.&#13;
It is, of course, not an easy task to forecast Swedish industrial&#13;
policy in the 1980s. However, by extrapolating from current policy goals and&#13;
methods one could argue that the following pattern seems probable. Some form&#13;
of assistance is likely to be granted to industries mainly in three kinds of&#13;
circumstances. The first is when the industry uses advanced technology. Much&#13;
of theassistance in the case of technologically leading sectors will be given&#13;
in disguised forms, such as preferences in public procurement and subsidies to&#13;
R&amp;D.&#13;
The second kind will be products which can be considered as&#13;
necessities" by some definition, where an increasing import penetration&#13;
reaches a very high, critical level.     In this case most types of protective&#13;
measures, including import restrictions, will probably be used.       The third&#13;
case is the industry with big plants, dominating a local labor market, in&#13;
acute   crisis,   due   to   global   overproduction   or   national   loss   of&#13;
competitiveness. In this case assistance will be given by subsidies, some of&#13;
which will have a permanently protective effect. The appearance of new&#13;
"problem  industries"  will  be  more   likely  if  the  current  macroeconomic&#13;
situation prevails.    The use of trade restrictions in Sweden will probably&#13;
closely follow international developments. This means that most assistance in&#13;
the three cases discussed will take the form of subsidies.       However, it is&#13;
possible that the increasingly difficult budget situation will lead to a more&#13;
frequent use of import restrictions, as a substitute for financially "costly"&#13;
forms of assistance.&#13;

2. Effective tariffs&#13;
Based on a 127 sector input-output table for Sweden (Hoglund &amp; Werin 1964),&#13;
tariff rates are given by the formula&#13;
1 - Ea .&#13;
T. = l          j- 1&#13;
J   1&#13;
where t. and t. are nominal tariffs on output and inputs, and a.. is&#13;
the input coefficient (for domestic goods plus imports) of good (i) in&#13;
sector (j). Services, energy etc are treated as importable, with zero&#13;
tariffs.&#13;
Due to the problems of obtaining a good concordance between BTN, SITC,&#13;
the input-output table and the industrial statistics, total coverage&#13;
could not be arrived at. The sample of goods covers 62 % of imports of&#13;
SITC 5-8. Excluded goods/sectors are mostly of the type "other", "n.e.s"&#13;
etc.&#13;

APPENDIX C&#13;
THE RELATIONS BETWEEN TARIFFS AND FACTOR INTENSITIES IN DIFFERENT MODELS&#13;
Let a.. and bkj be input coefficients of good (i) and factor (k) in process (j).&#13;
The production system of an economy can be described by the matrices A and B,&#13;
whose elements are a.. and bkj. Let W be the vector of domestic factor prices,&#13;
which we assume to be given. The cost of production for any good is given by&#13;
the vector&#13;
C = (I-A)'P+B'W&#13;
where P is the vector of goods prices.&#13;
Now let us assume that all goods, final goods as well as intermediate goods,&#13;
can be traded on the world market at given prices P. We assume further that&#13;
technology, i.e. the matrices A and B, is internationally the same. Thus the&#13;
free trade costs for intermediate goods per unit of output will be the same&#13;
domestically as in the rest of the world for any product. The value added,&#13;
i.e. the cost for factors of production per unit in domestic production,&#13;
will be&#13;
V = B'W&#13;
anf for production in the rest of the world&#13;
V0 = B'W &#13;
where W0 is a vector of factor prices in the rest of the world (expressed in&#13;
the same currency unit; we disregard the problem of general equilibrium and&#13;
possible exchange rate adjustments).&#13;
A domestic industry (j) for which V. &gt; Vo. is uncompetitive at the ruling&#13;
factor prices. However, it can be made competitive on the home market by&#13;
a suitable rate of tariff protection, defined implicitly by&#13;
V.&#13;
iVi&#13;
1 + T    --&#13;
O~Vj&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
C 2&#13;
Let V1 be a diagonal matrix of value added in world production, and T a vector&#13;
of effective tariff rates (the elements are 1 + T.). Then&#13;
T = V1  (V-VO) = V1lB'(W-W.)&#13;
The effective tariffs will then depend only on the differences between domestic&#13;
and international factor prices, and on the direct use of factors in the last&#13;
stage of processing, but not on the use of factors in earlier stages. The more&#13;
intensive, then, an industry tends to use (directly) expensive factors, the&#13;
higher its effective protection has to be.&#13;
We note that this holds true irrespectively of whether the intermediate goods&#13;
are actually imported or not, because the prices of domestically produced&#13;
intermediate goods do not depend on domestic factor costs.&#13;
Let us now suppose that intermediate products cannot be traded at all. However,&#13;
we retain the assumption that final goods are traded at given world market&#13;
prices and no transport costs. The cost of production of a good (j) will then&#13;
depend also on the use of factors in earlier stages of production. The cost&#13;
vector will be&#13;
C = [(I-A)'] 'B'W = EW&#13;
where the elements of matrix E are the coefficients for total use, directly&#13;
plus indirectly, of factors per unit of final product.&#13;
If the domestic cost of a product (j) exceeds the world market prices, pro-&#13;
duction can be made competitive by a nominal tariff that equates cost with&#13;
domestic market price. The vector t of nominal tariffs necessary to protect&#13;
production of any good will be&#13;
t = P1 1(C-P) = P1 1[(I-A)'] 1B'(W-WO) = P1 lE(W-WO)&#13;
The nominal tariff for a product will be higher the higher is the total use,&#13;
directly plus indirectly via intermediate goods, of expensive domestic factors&#13;
(at the given factor prices).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
C 3&#13;
Intermediate goods can be non-traded because of natural barriers such as&#13;
high transport costs, or because they are highly protected. It seems to us&#13;
then that the latter model, which highlights the relation between nominal&#13;
tariffs and total factor requirements, could be an acceptable approximation&#13;
of reality mainly for a large country with a highly protectionist trade policy&#13;
(in fact with almost prohibitive tariffs). For a small, open economy on the&#13;
other hand, which pursues a trade policy that is mainly free trade oriented,&#13;
but with occasional protectionist measures in certain "sensitive" sectors,&#13;
we believe that the first model would be better suited to the facts, and thus&#13;
the relation between effective tariffs and direct factor requirements more&#13;
promising to explore.&#13;
In the model we have worked with input coefficients in volume terms, while&#13;
in empirical applications we have to use value coefficients. To use the&#13;
shares of wages and capital costs in value added as measures of physical&#13;
labor and capital intensity means that we have to assume that factor prices&#13;
are equal in all sectors.&#13;

            Patterns of barriers to trade in Sweden : a
            study in the theory of protection
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The project seeks to establish the
            shares of industrial country markets held by the developing
            countries, changes in such shares in the 1970s, and why they
            vary among industry groups and countries. The aim is to
            assist developing and industrial countries to improve their
            policies through a better understanding of trade patterns
            and protectionist pressures. This paper studies the
            determinants of the inter-industry pattern of tariffs,
            non-tariff barriers to trade and domestic subsidies in
            Sweden, in the light of different hypotheses about causes of
            protection. The statistical results show that Swedish
            nominal and effective tariffs protect labor intensive
            industries in which protection is concentrated in large
            plants, that are not intensive in the use of skilled labor
            and research and development. The results are consistent
            with the hypothesis that the general goal of trade policy is
            to diversify the industrial structure by compensating for
            high comparative costs. Quantitative restrictions on imports
            follow much the same pattern, but subsidized industries are
            less homogenous.
