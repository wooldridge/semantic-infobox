Can private infrastructure last?&#13;
While government can pursue all its social objec-&#13;
tives for infrastructure provision under private own-&#13;
ership, important policy issues exist because many&#13;
users are dependent on a common facility-such as&#13;
an electricity network-that does not face head-to-&#13;
head competition. Whoever controls such a "natural"&#13;
monopoly can extract excessive profits (rents) from&#13;
it. The network owners, consumers, and the body&#13;
politic all try to get their hands on these rents.&#13;
Therefore, a sustainable ownership arrangement&#13;
requires a rent-sharing system that protects consum-&#13;
ers, provides owners with incentives to operate the&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The wave of infrastructure
            privatizations is now sweeping the globe. Whether this
            privatization wave will lead to lasting welfare gains or is
            just part of a historical cycle of privatization and
            nationalization is not yet clear. The answer will depend on
            whether governments can find competitive solutions to the
            provision of infrastructure services. This Note traces the
            causes of nationalizing infrastructure, describes the
            privatization-nationalization cycle, and discusses the
            advantages of private ownership. For the policymakers
            interested in efficiency gains, the pursuit of private
            infrastructure constitutes a risk-minimizing strategy, since
            private solutions hold the potential for greater benefit
            through competition. If policymakers promote private
            competitive franchises throughout the world, the emerging
            international infrastructure industry will grow. In its
            wake, private cross-border flows to finance infrastructure
            will increase.
