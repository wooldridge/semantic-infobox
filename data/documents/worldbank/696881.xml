1. COUNTRY BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1    Angola is an undeveloped but potentially wealthy country in Southem Africa. Yet despite&#13;
vast resources of oil, diamonds, rivers, coast and arable land, in 1994 the country's GDP was&#13;
estimated at US$420 per capita. The Angolan population, 10.9 million' in 1993, has suffered from&#13;
three consecutive decades of warfare. The war for independence from 1961 to 1974 provoked the&#13;
abrupt exodus of 300,000 Portuguese in 1974 draining the country of virtually all skills and&#13;
professions. The first civil war period was from 1976 to 1991, the second from 1992. The peace&#13;
process, now underway, was initiated with the signing of the Lusaka Peace Accords, in November&#13;
1994. There is cautious optimism that peace will continue to hold. On August 11, 1995, the&#13;
UNITA leader, Mr. Savimbi, accepted the Government's invitation to become one of the country's&#13;
tWo vice-presidents. On the military front, demobilization is to proceed in three phases: (a)&#13;
quartering of UNITA troops; (b) integration into a unified army; and (c) demobilization and&#13;
reintegration. Donor financing is sought for the demobilization process, which the UN estimates to&#13;
last 24 months and to cost US$103 million.&#13;
1.2   In the interim, social and economic infrastructure has deteriorated or been destroyed..&#13;
Despite massive emergency relief operations by Government and donor agencies, malnutrition and&#13;
food insecurity are chronic. The economic impact of the war is reflected in the GDP's decline of&#13;
23 percent in real terms from 1992 to 1993. The oil sector, responsible for 87.6 percent of&#13;
Government revenues, was unable to maintain previous production levels because facilities had&#13;
been destroyed. As the population fled rural areas, subsistence agriculture collapsed and markets&#13;
ceased to function. Lack of monetary constraint and fiscal contraction allowed annual inflation to&#13;
reach 1838 percent in 1993. The balance of payments deteriorated by 32 percent between 1991&#13;
and 1992: in 1993 the budget deficit stood at about 23 percent of GDP.&#13;
1.3    Per capita GNP2 for 1994 was estimated at US$250. Income distribution in Angola is&#13;
extremely skewed: a small group possess specialized but scarce skills: well-placed people in the oil&#13;
and military sectors enjoy high living standards. At the same time, well over half the Angolan&#13;
population falls below the poverty line (defined as the ability to buy a basic food basket or having&#13;
an income below one-third of the mean).3 Many of those working in the informal sector are women&#13;
who are constantly on the brink of disaster.&#13;
1.4    Population growth of 2.8 percent annually conceals the wide disparity between the&#13;
country's rapid urban growth rate (7.5 percent annually from 1980-89) and slower growth in rural&#13;
areas (0.3 percent for the same period). The urban population was estimated to be 42 percent of&#13;
the total population in 1993. It is likely that this percentage continued to grow during 1994.&#13;
Luanda alone is reported to hold one-fourth of the total population. The united nations estimates&#13;
that over 2 million people are now returming to the country (former refugees), or moving to cities in&#13;
search of work. They face unemployment, overcrowded living conditions, fragmented social&#13;

2   GNP is lower than GDP because foreign transfers in Angola are negative.&#13;
3   The Luanda Household Survey in 1991 found 64 percent of the population living under the poverty line; a&#13;
1993 study by Fernando Ribeiro prepared for the Poverty Workshop, estimated 86 percent under the poverty&#13;
line.&#13;

networks, and poor access to services which, even when available, are expensive. Many of the&#13;
urban poor live in squatter settlements without security of tenure.&#13;
1.5    Poverty in rural areas increases in direct proportion to the population's distance from&#13;
markets and major roads. Over 90 percent of the rural population is engaged in subsistence&#13;
farming and depends on marketing for cash income. Their livelihood in particular (and the rural&#13;
economy in general) would be substantially improved by better access to credit, markets,&#13;
information, and basic services (health, education, water, transport and sanitation) -- all severely&#13;
constrained at present.&#13;
1.6    Between 9 and 20 million land mines need to be cleared before economic and social&#13;
activities can be normalized. De-mining activities are being coordinated by the Mine Coordination&#13;
Office in UCAH (Coordination Unit for Humanitarian Aid, a UN body). The UN is allocating&#13;
US$11 million to cover the costs of establishing an institute, and training and equipping 24 teams&#13;
(720 persons) of Angolan "de-miners". Of these funds, $6 million have been allocated for the de-&#13;
mining of some 7,000 km of roads by a private South-African company. However, the costs of de-&#13;
mining are expected to be substantial and only a small portion is covered by the UN assessed&#13;
budget (not yet released).&#13;
1.7    Political stabilization and economic and social development are the Government's main&#13;
goals. The Government recognizes that the large macroeconomic imbalances, the structural&#13;
distortions, the high levels of poverty, and the disruption in basic services pose formidable&#13;
obstacles to economic growth and peace consolidation. A comprehensive strategy for medium-term&#13;
economic and social development and reform over the next three years is being prepared.&#13;
A. Social Sectors and Services&#13;
1.8    With the coming of peace, the Government of Angola faces many new challenges.&#13;
Although the State has been the sole provider of social services since independence, private health&#13;
clinics, pharmacies and schools have opened in the past three years, and churches are slowly&#13;
reclaiming their institutions which used to offer a range of social services. Lack of regulation has,&#13;
however, led to many unlicensed practices, particularly in pharmaceutical and medical services.&#13;
As a first step towards the development of private initiatives in social services, the Government&#13;
intends to monitor living conditions and poverty. NGOs and intemational aid agencies, who have&#13;
bocome the dominant providers of emergency food aid and medical care, are now being encouraged&#13;
to reorient resources towards rehabilitation and development.&#13;
1.9    Government expenditures in the social sectors have declined sharply since 1992, as&#13;
military expenditures have consumed an ever-increasing share of revenues. Spiraling inflation&#13;
rates have so eroded Govemment salaries4 that many civil servants have abandoned their posts or&#13;
have resorted to more lucrative activities. Provincial govemments have most of the administrative&#13;
authority in the social sectors; the transfers they receive from the central Govermment are&#13;
inadequate and provincial govemments have no legal authority to generate tax revenue. Some&#13;
revenue from duties and stamp fees is channeled to the social sectors, especially to health services,&#13;
but this comes nowhere near the resource level required.&#13;
4   High inflation rate (1,838 percent in 1993 and 972 percent in 1994) and highly fluctuating multiple exchange&#13;
rates make analysis difficult.&#13;

Health&#13;
1.10   Decades of war have exacted a heavy toll on the health of the Angolan population. Life&#13;
expectancy at birth is among the lowest in Africa at 45 years. The high total fertility rate,&#13;
estimated at 6.5 in 1990, contributes to poor matemal and child health care.5 In 1993, under-five&#13;
mortality was estimated to be 320 per thousand and infant mortality: 195 per thousand live births.&#13;
In the same year, the matemal mortality rate in Luanda hospitals was estimated at 900 per 100,000&#13;
live births, up from 800 per 100,000 in 1989. Measles, diarrhea and malaria -- all preventable and&#13;
treatable -- are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Tuberculosis is a resurgent problem,&#13;
exacerbated by AIDS.&#13;
1.11   Many health facilities, especially in rural areas, were destroyed by the war. Despite the&#13;
scarcity of medicine and the dilapidated infrastructure, public facilities remain the principal source&#13;
of health care for most people. Most facilities were built in the 1960s and 1970s, and need&#13;
replacement or substantial renovation. Govenmment budget allocations to the health sector declined&#13;
from 4.4 percent in 1994 to 2.8 percent in 1995. The share allocated to primary health care is&#13;
neligible (less than US$0.01 per capita). Instead, limited public resources tend to favor health&#13;
care in tertiary hospitals. This has not been sufficient to retain health professionals; between 1991&#13;
and 1993 the number of Angolan doctors in the public sector decreased from 662 to 630; the&#13;
number of nurses decreased from 9,145 to 5,780 (39 percent). Some doctors may have moved to&#13;
private sector practice. Some nurses may have left the profession or moved to the private sector.&#13;
Cost-recovery schemes do not yet exist, although a health law approved in April 1992 opens the&#13;

door for private sector participation and permits the introduction of user charges for health&#13;
services.&#13;
Education&#13;
1.12   Literacy rates are 50 percent for men and 30 percent for women. This represents a&#13;
significant improvement since independence, when only 12 percent of the population was&#13;
considered literate. In recent years, as both students and teachers fled rural areas, the primary&#13;
school net enrollment rate has dropped to 50 percent.6 Secondary school education is underfunded&#13;
and the enrollment rate is calculated to be 12 percent.&#13;
1.13   Many schools (especially in rural areas) were closed or destroyed by the war; the&#13;
remaining few are severely overcrowded (in Luanda classroom size averages 140 students) and&#13;
many schools are forced to operate on a three-shift system to accommodate the overflow of&#13;
students. The quality of both urban and rural primary education suffers from deteriorating&#13;
facilities, where poorly-trained teachers are often demoralized by the lack of equipment and books.&#13;
1.14   The national budget allocation for education was slashed from 18 percent in 1991 to 6&#13;
percent in 1994. Efforts have been made to mobilize altemative sources for sector-specific training&#13;
(for example, a petroleum tax for training in the petroleum sector), but in general, there is neither a&#13;
policy framework to promote private financing, nor cost recovery for either general or technical&#13;
education.&#13;
Water and Sanitation&#13;
1.15   Only 30 percent of the population, primarily in urban areas, has access to safe water, and&#13;
even this access is sporadic. Water supply in Luanda is subject to frequent interruptions and fecal&#13;
contamination. Since many urban settlements are unplanned, the local authorities are unable to&#13;
provide essential services. The increasing volume of garbage dumped in residential areas and&#13;
inadequate sanitation and waste disposal facilities in urban areas are leading to increasing&#13;
outbreaks of disease and pollution. The incidence of water-borne diseases, including cholera in&#13;
recent years, is high in rural areas where the destruction of water pumps and wells during the war&#13;
virtually ended the supply of safe water. This has particularly affected women and children, who&#13;
must walk long distances to fetch water for daily needs. The services offered at health facilities&#13;
and schools are limited by inadequate water and sanitation facilities.&#13;
Household Food Security&#13;
1.16   During the long civil war Angolans endured many years of food shortages, acute&#13;
malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies and even starvation.7 Food insecurity affects 70 percent of&#13;
the population who have been intemally displaced, are returning from exile, or are among the&#13;
millions of urban and rural poor.&#13;
6   Educa,io em Angola, Ministry of Education, TLuanda, May 1993; Net enrollment rate is defined as the official&#13;
primary school age pupils as a percentage of the official school age population.&#13;
7   World Food Program, UNICEF and NGOs missions have documented severe malnutrition and starvation in&#13;
cities besieged by UNITA. A Bank mission reported the same findings from Malange in November 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.17   Poverty and food availability are directly correlated to the economic infrastructure and to&#13;
the accessibility of and distance to markets and urban centers. In war-tom Angola, markets have&#13;
been destroyed, storage facilities are in short supply, and access to both is complicated by poor&#13;
road conditions.8 Food availability is limited seasonally, especially when the roads become&#13;
impassable because of heavy rains. Local authorities have not been able to maintain rural roads&#13;
because of lack of security, operating funds and equipment. In urban areas, road conditions make&#13;
public transport scarce or expensive, further constraining economic activity.&#13;
1.18   The capacity for local food production has been devastated, and output has steadily&#13;
declined, from 100 kg/capita of grain-equivalent in 1980 to an estimated 67 kg/capita in September&#13;
1993. This is an average of less than 600 calories per person per day, compared to the 2,100&#13;
calories required for the average adult. Large areas of fertile land lie fallow because of uncleared&#13;
land mines. Crop yields could be substantially increased through the use of fertilizer and&#13;
pesticides, rehabilitation and construction of irrigation channels and de-mining. Most of Angola's&#13;
large agro-industrial processing plants are closed or destroyed, forcing the population to depend on&#13;
imported, processed food. Each provincial govemor may have a lump-surn budget to import food&#13;
to be distributed to social institutions, including cafeterias, orphanages, schools, and hospitals, but&#13;
budgets are tragically insufficient. Private traders no longer have the foreign currency to import&#13;
food, and the private sector is struggling to reactivate food supply, processing and distribution.&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy and Past Involvement&#13;
1.19   Angola joined the World Bank Group in 1989. In 1991, the Bank responded promptly to&#13;
the first peace process and to the Govemment's initial reform efforts by stepping-up lending to help&#13;
strengthen institutional capacity and rebuild human and physical capital. Eight IDA credits to&#13;
Angola in FY91-93 totaled about US$245 million. This IDA assistance program emphasized&#13;
capacity building and preparation work for high-priority rehabilitation of physical and social&#13;
infrastructure. The implementation of the Angola portfolio has been affected by the war, which&#13;
broke out shortly after most such projects had been approved. This has required restructuring of&#13;
some projects covering geographic areas which are not currently accessible. In some cases the&#13;
result has been project designs which no longer correspond to changed post-war priorities.&#13;
1.20   The Bank assistance strategy in FY95 reflected a "low-case" scenario, with a minimum&#13;
core lending program focusing on poverty alleviation, capacity building, and human resource&#13;
development. The peace process, initiated in November 1994, appears to be gaining momentum as&#13;
a result of the May and August 1995 meetings between President dos Santos and Mr. Savimbi.&#13;
The economic reform process resumed in June 1995 with the virtual reunification of the official&#13;
and parallel exchange rates and the 200-fold increase of oil product prices; it is now gaining speed&#13;
and suggests strong commitment to comprehensive reforms. The recent Country Portfolio&#13;
Performance Review (13-14 June, 1995) was a success. The Government manifested strong&#13;
commitment to improve portfolio performance and prepared an Action Plan to achieve that&#13;
objective. The Government's commitment and the cessation of hostilities are expected to lead to&#13;
speedier implementation and greater focus on the policy reform aspects of operations.&#13;
1.21   Angola needs support in its triple transition from war to peace, from a centrally planned&#13;
economy to a market-based economy, and from authoritarian to accountable governance. IDA's&#13;
assistance strategy focuses on facilitating the transition to a peacetime economy by helping to&#13;
rehabilitate devastated economic and social infrastructure, by supporting the process of economic&#13;

transition, by helping design and implement the macroeconomic and sector policies needed to&#13;
stabilize the economy and provide production incentives, and by building capacity in economic&#13;
management. A Social Action Fund would complement these efforts by encouraging capacity-&#13;
building at the community level. A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is currently being&#13;
developed.&#13;
B. Lessons Learned&#13;
The Angola Social Action Fund (FAS): Lessons From the Pilot Experience&#13;
1.22   An IDA Project Preparation Facility advance (PPF) of US$2 million for the creation of a&#13;
social fund to be executed by the Fundo de Apoio Social (FAS), was approved in 1993. The&#13;
Angolan Government created the FAS, in October 1994, as an autonomous, decentralized agency&#13;
to channel funds to communities. Administratively the FAS is headed by the National Board of&#13;
Overseers (NBO) which sets policy. The National Coordination Unit (NCU), the central body,&#13;
gives technical support, coordinates and supervises the activities of provincial offices, and manages&#13;
the flow of funds between the Government and the provincial level. The provincial offices identify,&#13;
approve and disburse the funds and supervise the community-based projects. The provincial&#13;
offices are in close contact with the Provincial Board of Overseers. Currently the fund is fully&#13;
established in four provincial offices: Benguela, Kwanza Sul, Namibe and Cabinda.&#13;
1.23   To date, 87 sub-projects have been approved, totaling US$1,656,000 equivalent. Eight&#13;
sub-projects have been finalized and 31 are currently being executed. Disbursement for sub-&#13;
project implementation totals about US$400,000 equivalent, averaging US$30,000 per month per&#13;
province. Approximately 120 additional sub-projects are in the preparation pipeline. Thus far,&#13;
these are largely for schools, health posts and water supply (including water supply for cattle).&#13;
1.24   The pilot experience has permitted testing and improvement of procuremnent and&#13;
disbursement procedures; for example, simplified statements of expenditures (SOE) have been used&#13;
since May, 1995. It has also provided indications of expected rates of sub-project implementation&#13;
and FAS expansion to other provinces. During the pilot, the FAS has established transparent&#13;
management systems and systems for sub-project identification, approval and supervision, as well&#13;
as a computerized monitoring system at the provincial level to keep the NCU (and donors)&#13;
informed on sub-project status.&#13;
1.25   The Social Fund was established first in the province of Kwanza Sul, which has a&#13;
population of about 1 million people. It is an agricultural province which produces a significant&#13;
surplus of food crops, as well as coffee and cotton. At the time that the FAS office was&#13;
established, Kwanza Sul was divided by the war: the coastal areas were under the control of the&#13;
Government. During the pilot period, the war ended and the inland areas, which had suffered&#13;
substantial physical damage, became accessible to the FAS.&#13;
1.26  Initial community response to FAS in Kwanza Sul was very poor. Evaluation of the&#13;
situation revealed the need to:&#13;
(a) work with partners involved in community development activities, in particular NGOs&#13;
and churches;&#13;
(b) include in the FAS team personnel with the experience needed to design a social&#13;
communication program; and,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
(c) initiate information and social communication activities, even before opening a new&#13;
provincial office.&#13;
1.27   At the early stages sub-project implementation was slow. The situation was evaluated and&#13;
it was decided to:&#13;
(a) assist communities to find technical solutions to their problems and work with NGOs&#13;
to resolve implementation and management problems;&#13;
(b) appraise projects carefully and withhold approval until all criteria are met;&#13;
(c) seek back-up from the NCU when situations pass the competencies of the Provincial&#13;
Offices;&#13;
(d) analyze issues as soon as these arise and make decisions quickly;&#13;
(e) share experience between provinces;&#13;
(f) establish a routine for sub-project identification, approval and supervision so that&#13;
decisions on project approvals can be taken quickly; and,&#13;
(g) work closely with the Provincial Board of Overseers to establish the work program,&#13;
especially where cooperation from government agencies or NGOs is needed.&#13;
1.28   The first months of decentralization showed lack of up-to-date information on sub-project&#13;
implementation at the NCU and at donor level. Accordingly it was decided to:&#13;
(a) set-up a Management and Monitoring Information System to provide weekly updates&#13;
from the provinces to the NCU on a short computerized form; and&#13;
(b) design a monthly summary of these reports, including an analysis of the situation,&#13;
problem identification and actions taken (this monthly report is sent to IDA).&#13;
1.29   Most of the provinces faced problems such as shortage of construction materials, and the&#13;
virtual absence of a banking system. The FAS has leamed to overcome these problems through:&#13;
(a) working out creative banking solutions (including an IOU system with local&#13;
wholesalers);&#13;
(b) regular information-sharing on the availability of materials and the initiation of works&#13;
from the provinces to Luanda and vice versa (and between provinces); and,&#13;
(c) exploring altematives to traditional suppliers for scarce materials.&#13;
1.30   Technical evaluation of the first finished sub-projects suggest a low technical capacity to&#13;
analyze architectural designs and to deal with procurement issues within the FAS provincial teams.&#13;
As a result the FAS:&#13;
(a) now includes one technical staff member with an engineering or architecture&#13;
background in all provincial teams,&#13;
(b) provides twice a year training in procurement and disbursement procedures and related&#13;
issues during the life of the project;&#13;
(c) operates a supervision schedule by which the specialist in procurement and&#13;
architecture at the NCU visits the provinces; and,&#13;
(d) ensures that provincial teams now discuss with communities ways to improve the&#13;
quality of the proposals.&#13;
&#13;

General Lessons Learned&#13;
1.31   Several lessons9 have emerged from social funds in other countries. These have influenced&#13;
the conceptual framework, design and implementation arrangements of the Angola FAS. During&#13;
the preparation of the Project, the FAS team visited the Salvador and Bolivia Social Funds and&#13;
later adapted some concepts to the Angolan context. Both visits were especially valuable because&#13;
the team leamed about potential pitfalls at first hand. Peer reviewers within the Bank included&#13;
staff with in-depth knowledge of Social Funds and poverty issues, inside and outside the region,&#13;
1.32   Some principal lessons leamed which influenced the FAS design and operation include:&#13;
(a)    the importance of administrative autonomy to avoid political interference,&#13;
especially in a country undergoing transition;&#13;
(b)    the importance of having few, realistic and measurable objectives;&#13;
(c)    the desirability of financing small, technologically simple projects with substantial&#13;
community involvement;&#13;
(d)    the need for transparency;&#13;
(e)    the need to attract the best possible staff;&#13;
(f)    the desirability of simplifying procurement and disbursement procedures to make&#13;
sub-project implementation efficient and encourage the participation of small local&#13;
contractors;&#13;
(g)    the importance of strong supervision of the communities by the social fund during&#13;
sub-project execution; and,&#13;
(h)    the importance of regular supervision of the social fund administration by&#13;
Government and Donors.&#13;

2. THIE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives and Summary Description&#13;
2.1    The Social Action Project (SAP) aims to assist Angola in its transition from war to peace,&#13;
targeting in particular the people impoverished by the military and economic crises.&#13;
2.2    Objectives. The objectives of the Project are to:&#13;
(a) improve access to basic services through the provision or rehabilitation of community&#13;
infrastructure;&#13;
(b) improve the capacity of communities and NGOs to plan, appraise, manage and&#13;
maintain investment activities, through experience gained in the Project;&#13;
(c) generate additional income and employment in rural and urban areas through revenue-&#13;
generating sub-projects; and,&#13;
(d) enhance the capacity of Angolan institutions to collect and analyze poverty-related&#13;
data;&#13;
(e) provide a better understanding of the main causes of poverty in order to help formulate&#13;
effective poverty alleviation strategies and generate adequate policies for&#13;
socioeconomic development.&#13;
2.3   Summary of Project Description. To achieve these objectives the SAP will finance over a&#13;
four-year period, operational costs, infrastructure rehabilitation and construction, equipment and&#13;
vehicles, training activities, surveys and studies, for the following two components:&#13;
(a)    A Social Action Fund component executed by the Fundo de Apoio Social (fAS)&#13;
(93 .5 percent of total project costs) which will finance sub-projects identified,&#13;
prepared and implemented by local communities. These sub-projects will be&#13;
appraised and supervised by the FAS;&#13;
(b)    A Poverty Monitoring component executed by the Gabinete de Monitorizaao da&#13;
Condices de Vida da Populacao (GMCVP Office for Monitoring Living&#13;
Conditions of the Population) of the National Statistics Institute (INE) (6.5&#13;
percent of total project cost). This component will finance policy-relevant research&#13;
on poverty and social issues, and systematic poverty monitoring through&#13;
household surveys.&#13;
2.4   Project Rationale. The greatest challenge facing the Government of Angola at present is&#13;
to restore social confidence and promote the resumption of economic growth, with a sharp focus on&#13;
poverty alleviation and job creation. A critical element in this program will be the provision of&#13;
basic social and economic infrastructure throughout the country.&#13;
2.5    The Govenment has articulated a National Community Reconstruction Program aimed at&#13;
restoring social services and security in peri-urban and rural areas. This project was presented at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
the Round Table in Brussels as one component of the National Program. Recognizing that&#13;
addressing community needs was fundamental for the country's reconstruction and stability, even&#13;
before the peace treaty was signed, Govenmment requested IDA's assistance to set up a project to&#13;
support community-based rehabilitation of basic social, productive and economic infrastructure.&#13;
Several alternatives were considered for the program. The Government realizes that although the&#13;
existing structure is well-suited for serving the needs of the central urban areas, it may not be&#13;
adequate to serve outlying urban or rural areas, and it may not incorporate community input to the&#13;
extent necessary. One model considered was the semi-public procurement agency (known as&#13;
Agence d 'Execution des Travaux d 'Interet Public or AGETIP in several African countries) where&#13;
the focus is on ensuring the access of small contractors to the public investments. Currently this is&#13;
not feasible in Angola as the contracting industry is in its infancy and is not geared towards labor-&#13;
intensive implementation. This approach is difficult to reconcile with a full demand-driven&#13;
approach needed to ensure the full participation of communities in identification and&#13;
implementation of sub-projects.&#13;
2.6    The remaining option is the social investment fund model which has been successfully&#13;
applied in several African and Latin American countries (including Zambia, Bolivia, Ethiopia and&#13;
Honduras). Restoring self-confidence in communities and building community feeling is very&#13;
important in Angola where the social fabric has been damaged by years of conflict. Social&#13;
investment funds have proved to be both successful in encouraging commnunity participation and&#13;
sufficiently flexible to meet community demand's at lower costs than Govenmment provision would&#13;
entail. During the pilot phase, the average investment costs per square meter to rehabilitate&#13;
primary schools was estimated at US$80; the cost to rehabilitate a primary school by the&#13;
Government would average US$358 per square meter (see Annex 0).&#13;
2.7    On the basis of these considerations, Government decided to create a social fund. The&#13;
Government proposed that 93.5 percent of the proceeds of the Credit be channeled through an&#13;
autonomous decentralized agency, the FAS, under the Ministry of Planning. During its pilot&#13;
phase, the FAS has proved its ability to react quickly and effectively to medt community demands.&#13;
Being part of the local community, staff at the provincial level are readily accountable to the&#13;
community and are immediately familiar with the most vulnerable and poor areas in their&#13;
provinces.&#13;
2.8    Because poverty alleviation and human resource development are the most critical areas to&#13;
be monitored, a second small component of the Project will begin to re-establish basic statistical&#13;
capacity. Because of decades of war, Angola has virtually no capacity to conduct household and&#13;
other national surveys and so cannot monitor changes in the extent and nature of poverty.&#13;
2.9    The current Project responds to Government's request for support by offering a&#13;
streamlined and flexible approach to community needs for micro projects providing economic and&#13;
social infrastructure, support for directly productive investment, and a Poverty Monitoring&#13;
component that will strengthen the country's capacity to identify the needs of the population. The&#13;
project is consistent with the Government's own development objectives and reflects the priorities&#13;
of IDA's country assistance objectives, namely, poverty alleviation and human resource&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- Il -&#13;
B. Social Action Fund Component&#13;
Creation and Strategy&#13;
2.10   The Angolan Govemment created the FAS10, by Decree No. 44/94 of October 5, 1994,&#13;
and Executive Decree No. 2/94 of December 30, 1994, as an autonomous structure in order to&#13;
have flexible funding, procurement and disbursement procedures and to avoid political interference.&#13;
At negotiafions, agreement was reached with Government to establish a Subsidiary Grant&#13;
Agreement between Govemment and the FAS, acceptable to IDA, which will govern the granting&#13;
of the proceeds of IDA Credit to the FAS. The execution of this agreement is a condition for the&#13;
effectiveness of the Credit.&#13;
2.11   The FAS operates as a decentralized financial intermediary, funneling funds provided by&#13;
Government and by external donors towards projects identified by the local population in low-&#13;
income areas (sub-projects). It is designed to offer support for private sector development&#13;
(especially in labor-intensive public works) and provide temporary employment to rural and peri-&#13;
urban communities, with the goal of reducing poverty and reintegrating destitute groups into the&#13;
economy. Nucleos comunitarios" can apply for funds directly and sponsor2 themselves, or be&#13;
represented by an agencia de enquadramento'3, that acts as sponsor. Sub-projects should address&#13;
the most critical needs of the majority of the community, whose interest is demonstrated by a 10-&#13;
20% financial commitment. This commitment must be verified at a community meeting. The local&#13;
authority's plans to cover maintenance and recurrent costs are integral parts of each sub-project&#13;
proposal.&#13;
2.12   The FAS focuses its interventions in established communities. Internally displaced&#13;
persons and refugees are not targeted specifically by the FAS; however, if they live within a stable&#13;
community, they will benefit from FAS-financed activities. Other organizations such as UNHCR,&#13;
UCA, and several NGOs target those specific groups.&#13;
2.13   The FAS is currently active in four provinces out of 18. In line with expansion strategy&#13;
(Annex C), FAS expects to broaden its field of activities at a rate of 2 to 3 new provinces every six&#13;
months until it covers the whole country. Expansion to a new province will wait until activities in&#13;
a province in which the FAS is already active, are consolidated. Activities in a province will be&#13;
considered "consolidated" when the ratio of staff salaries to disbursement for sub-projects is equal&#13;
to or less than 1:10 over two consecutive months. During negotiations, it was agreed that FAS&#13;
would apply the criteria for expansion of activities to additional provinces according to those&#13;
specified in the FAS Administrative and Procedures Manuals. Compliance with the strategy and&#13;
criteria for expansion will be examined during the semi-annual reviews.&#13;
0  More information about the FAS can be found in annex D, which presents a translation of promotional&#13;
materials developed by the FAS. The Procedures Manual and the Administrative Manual of the FAS,&#13;
(including the FAS statutes of incorporation), are available in the project file.&#13;
I   nucleo comunitcirio (community group): group of persons living in a community and representing the ideas and&#13;
interest of a large group within that community.&#13;
12  Sponsor: nucleos comunitario andagincias de enquadramento can act as sub-project sponsors, that is, they can&#13;
become responsible for identifying, presenting and implementing a FAS-financed sub-project.&#13;
3  Agencia de enquadramento: differs from the nucleo comunitario in that these are formally constituted, have&#13;
some regular source of funding, and generally have a greater organizational capacity (such as churches and&#13;
NGOs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
2.14   The following types of activities can be financed though the FAS:&#13;
(a)    Social infrastructure, such as repair or construction of primary and secondary&#13;
schools, pnrmary health care facilities, water supply and sanitation works;&#13;
(b)    Productive infrastructure, such as repair or construction of markets, storage&#13;
facilities and conservation plants for agriculture, livestock or fisheries, and&#13;
irrigation canals;&#13;
(c)    Economic infrastructure, such as repair of small roads and bridges. For sub-&#13;
projects that entail the rehabilitation or construction of infrastructure, technically&#13;
justified, labor-intensive procedures are used to encourage the generation of paid&#13;
employment; and&#13;
(d)    Revenue-generating sub-projects for community-based groups, particularly those&#13;
representing women, ranging from handicrafts (ceramics, tailoring, emnbroidery&#13;
and food processing) to agricultural production. These are only eligible for&#13;
financing through an agencia de enquadramento.&#13;
For the implementation of sub-projects, the IDA Credit through the FAS, will finance civil works&#13;
contracts, construction materials and goods (including the initial investment in supplies for schools&#13;
and health facilities, such as furniture and medical supplies, as well as capital equipment for small&#13;
enterprise development such as, boat motors and nets). Occasionally, technical advisory services&#13;
will be financed to help the communities prepare projects (for example, roads). These services are&#13;
not to exceed 10 percent of the sub-project costs, as specified in the FAS Manuals.&#13;
Areas of Intervention&#13;
2.15   Sub-projects that involve social infrastructure are geared towards the re-establishment of&#13;
social services in Angola. Most of FAS's basic social services funding is being allocated for&#13;
health and education-related activities, mainly for rehabilitation of infrastructure, sanitation, and&#13;
water supply. The communities are responsible for maintaining the facilities. Criteria for sub-&#13;
project selection are specified in the FAS Manuals (see details in Annex E.)&#13;
2.16   Within the health sector, the FAS funds the construction, rehabilitation, extension and&#13;
equipment of both rural and urban first-level health facilities. This will often include staff housing,&#13;
especially in remote areas. Within the education sector, the construction, rehabilitation and&#13;
extension of primary schools is a priority. The FAS is also funding the initial supply of teaching&#13;
materials and essential drugs. All social sector facilities receiving assistance from the FAS include&#13;
a water and sanitation component if required.&#13;
2.17   Investments to improve water supply include the rehabilitation and expansion of water&#13;
supply systems where the technology applied is simple, appropriate and cost-effective to maintain.&#13;
In rural areas, simple hand-dug wells (with windlasses and buckets), or bore-holes (where the&#13;
water table is very deep) may be funded. For such sub-projects FAS encourages communities to&#13;
establish a maintenance committee with a cost-sharing function. Local authorities are becoming&#13;
more aware of water and sanitation issues through district workshops organized by the FAS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.18   Given the importance of productive infrastructure in helping to alleviate poverty, the FAS&#13;
encourages the construction or rehabilitation of markets and storage facilities that improve&#13;
conditions for agricultural production and household food security.&#13;
2.19   The FAS finances improvement and rehabilitation of community-based economic&#13;
infrastructure, such as the rehabilitation or the reconstruction of earth-surfaced rural roads and&#13;
small bridges. In urban areas, community priorities are mostly pen'-urban road rehabilitation,&#13;
market construction, and waste disposal. In appraising such interventions, the Project seeks the&#13;
guidance and involvement of appropriate expertise from local government and other agencies.&#13;
2.20   The revenue-generating sub-projects will be implemented through agencias de&#13;
enquadramento, who will act as management advisors and provide trainring in financial and&#13;
business management. This is especially important in Angola where there is little experience with&#13;
this type of project. Funding will be done through grants to community groups implementing&#13;
projects rather than to individuals. However, in order to explore possibilities within the Angola&#13;
context, soon after Credit effectiveness, the FAS will organize a seminar to discuss issues related&#13;
to these types of sub-project, and to determine a strategy for action. The seminar will assess the&#13;
feasibility of sub-projects proposed by communities to date. One outcome of the seminar will be&#13;
criteria to identify, appraise, and implement these projects. Seminar participants will include&#13;
representatives from communities, NGOs, commercial banks, IDA, UN agencies and consultants.&#13;
2.21   The areas of emphasis within FAS's overall portfolio are likely to change over the lifetime&#13;
of the Project. More social infrastructure sub-projects are likely be implemented in the first years;&#13;
the number of other types of sub-projects are likely to increase later.&#13;
FAS Management&#13;
2.22   The National Board of Overseers (NBO) or Comite de Coordena,do Nacional, is the&#13;
governing body of the FAS. Membership includes representatives of Government (6 seats), NGOs&#13;
(2), churches (2) and private sector organizations, (such as the Chamber of Commerce) (2). This&#13;
Board defines FAS policies, monitors all FAS activities and ensures contact with, and&#13;
representation of, the wide support base of donors, Government, the NGO community and the&#13;
churches.&#13;
2.23   The Provincial Board of Overseers (Comite de Coordena,cao Provincial), has primarily&#13;
an advisory role, and one of technical support to the Provincial Office. Membership may vary but&#13;
usually includes representatives of all of the groups referred to in para 2.2 as well as&#13;
representatives of the beneficiaries. Responsibilities include the determination of provincial&#13;
strategies and priorities, and advising and supporting the Provincial Office in its activities. The&#13;
Board ensures the link between the Provincial Authorities and the FAS and representation of all&#13;
stakeholders.&#13;
2.24   The National Coordinating Unit (NCU) or Unidade de Coordena,do, proposes priorities,&#13;
targeting objectives, strategies and impact evaluations for consideration by the National Board of&#13;
Overseers. NCU manages donor relations (and their accounts and disbursements), and day-to-day&#13;
interactions with Government. It also guides the establishment of Provincial Offices and provides&#13;
support for their operations. The NCU, and in particular the executive director, is responsible for&#13;
the overall management of FAS activities, including operating systems to allow the regular&#13;
approval and completion of projects in a cost-effective manner. This unit is staffed by an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
executive director, a deputy director, an administrator, a civil engineer who deals also with&#13;
procurement issues, a computer specialist and support staff.&#13;
2.25   Most operational responsibilities lie in the Provincial Offices, where sub-projects are&#13;
identified, appraised, approved, monitored and closed. Provincial staff have been selected from&#13;
local candidates (already living in the province) who have a broad range of experience and a&#13;
commitment to development goals. Every team has at least one person with engineering&#13;
qualifications, an assistant accountant, a computer specialist, a social scientist or a communication&#13;
specialist. Usually the social scientist or the civil engineer are also directors. During&#13;
negotiations, Government agreed to require FAS to engage professional staff at national and&#13;
provincial levels, with qualifications and experience, and on terms and conditions of employment&#13;
acceptable to IDA throughout project implementation. A more detailed description of the roles&#13;
and responsibilities of the FAS management structure can be found in Annex D. For the set-up of&#13;
the provincial offices, the Credit will finance upgrades and renovations of buildings, and the&#13;
procurement of office equipment and furniture.&#13;
2.26   The Credit will finance the FAS operating costs including salaries of the FAS staff,&#13;
transport, fuel and office supplies. To smooth project implementation, the Credit will also finance:&#13;
(i) training for the FAS staff: workshops on procurement and disbursement procedures twice a&#13;
year. During project preparation, study trips such as visits to social funds in other countries,&#13;
substantially improved the design of the FAS. About two staff months per year have been&#13;
budgeted for that purpose in future for new staff; (ii) advisory services: such as accountancy,&#13;
auditing and legal counsel; those services have already been contracted; and, (iii) consultants&#13;
services to set-up an information, education and communication (IEC) program to inform&#13;
communities and stakeholders about FAS and its operating mechanisms.&#13;
2.27   Nucleos comunitarios implement the sub-projects. Sponsors (who may be the nucleo&#13;
comunitairios themselves) supervise project implementation and keep financial and technical&#13;
records. These records must show the degree and form of community participation.&#13;
2.28   The FAS uses information-sharing mechanisms as a way to mobilize community&#13;
participation. During sub-project implementation, field visits and interviews as well as&#13;
consultative meetings, ensure community participation. FAS will use annual beneficiary&#13;
assessments to evaluate sub-project performance as well as the appropriateness of FAS response to&#13;
the perceived needs of the community.&#13;
Sub-project Cycle&#13;
2.29   The mechanisms regulating the functioning of the FAS are specified in its Administrative&#13;
Manual (Manual de Gestdo). A Procedures Manual (Manual de Procedimentos) describes the&#13;
sub-project cycle in detail. It includes separate chapters describing the FAS disbursement and&#13;
procurement procedures, and forms. These documents are available in the project file (see Annex&#13;
B). These Manuals have been extensively discussed with IDA during project preparation, and&#13;
were approved by the National Board of Overseers in July 1995. Updated versions of the FAS&#13;
Administrative and Procedures Manuals (Manuais de Gestdo e de Procedimentos) were reviewed&#13;
by IDA during negotiations. The documents may be updated, revised and improved as project&#13;
implementation proceeds, but it was agreed during negotiations that the Procedures and&#13;
Administrative Manuals of the FAS will be at all times satisfactory to IDA, and that these will not&#13;
be modified without IDA 's prior agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
2.30   Identification. Sub-projects are initially identified by the communities or agencies&#13;
representing them14. These communities or agencies then apply to the provincial FAS office for&#13;
funds. Sub-project proposals should address the needs of the community and should ultimately&#13;
target the poor and vulnerable. Community support is evidenced by contribution to the sub-project&#13;
costs (in cash or kind and ascertained by the field appraisal team). The proposal should&#13;
demonstrate that the sub-project can be successfully completed within six months, and must use&#13;
local materials whenever possible.&#13;
2.31   While the FAS may provide technical assistance in project preparation and&#13;
implementation, it does not execute projects. However, since the technical capacity of the&#13;
communities (or the groups representing them) may be insufficient, the proposal specifies when&#13;
technical support from outside the community is needed. In that case, the proposal includes this&#13;
assistance in the cost estimates, and the FAS office helps the community to seek local advisory&#13;
services and costs them. Standard technical specifications are being drawn up for common social&#13;
infrastructure projects such as schools, health posts and staff houses. These will be consistent with&#13;
the norms and standards of the sector ministries, and will draw on community participation in&#13;
materials and labor. These standard technical specifications can simplify project preparation in&#13;
that they: (a) give the community and the sponsors confidence that their project is acceptable on&#13;
technical grounds; (b) cut costs of repetitiously engineering each sub-project; (c) allow bid awards&#13;
to be made solely on price; (d) facilitate sub-project approval decision; and (e) facilitate monitoring&#13;
while ensuring quality.&#13;
2.32 Appraisal and ApprovaL Since the FAS strives for a high standard of transparency,&#13;
explicit appraisal criteria for sub-projects have been developed (see Annex E). These include&#13;
performance of the sponsor in previous sub-projects, evidence of sustainability, and the provision&#13;
of recurrent costs.&#13;
2.33 The FAS team and the Provincial Board of Overseers screen applications for sub-&#13;
projects .5 In projects presented by communities with special characteristics (for example,&#13;
nomadic groups), the team may include social sector technical staff. Some projects may be&#13;
referred to technical staff for revision and improvement. The NBO and IDA prior review the first&#13;
two projects of each new type (for example, school or revenue-generating types).&#13;
2.34   Applications considered consistent with the criteria are then appraised in the field by the&#13;
FAS provincial director or civil engineer. Field appraisal forms have been developed for every&#13;
sector, and include guidelines for both technical appraisal of the proposed sub-project and for&#13;
appraisal of community commitment. The community contribution is reviewed in detail and agreed&#13;
with the community. The material component of the community contribution should have already&#13;
been collected and be evident at field appraisal before a sub-project is confirmed for funding. At&#13;
this point, the budget, timetables, procurement arrangements and community involvement are&#13;
assessed in detail. When the community is obviously very poor, and is willing but unable to meet&#13;
the full community contribution, the appraisal team may recommend a lesser contribution on a&#13;
case-by-case basis. A financial agreement is then prepared which includes detailed budgets and a&#13;
description of the responsibilities of the various parties involved in the sub-project. In this&#13;
agreement, disbursement and procurement schedules are outlined.&#13;
14  See also Annex A.&#13;
15  Outsiders may be invited to assist in this appraisal. For example, a revaeue-generating project may require&#13;
analysis and commentary from someone in the banking sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
2.35   Field appraisal reports are submitted to the provincial FAS team for consideration.&#13;
Approval is needed from the provincial direction for sub-projects up to US$20,000. Sub-projects&#13;
over this amount have to be approved by the executive director. Sub-projects exceeding&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent in total value (including contributions by other donors, NGOs and agencies)&#13;
will have to be approved by IDA and the NBO. During the pilot phase, average project size, and&#13;
complexity, increased from US$10,000 in the first months to US$18,000 after 6 months of&#13;
operation.&#13;
2.36   Implementation. Following the formal approval of a sub-project proposal, a contract with&#13;
the community is signed, making the financial agreement legally binding. Funds are deposited by&#13;
the NCU in provincial accounts and disbursed directly to providers of materials or to implementing&#13;
firms on their presentation of a receipt signed by the authorized representative of the sponsor.&#13;
Occasionally, procurement of goods may require national or intemational competitive bidding. In&#13;
such cases, the FAS helps the community to prepare the bidding package or, for Intemational&#13;
Competitive Bidding, prepares the package for the community.&#13;
2.37   Political credibility of the FAS could be undermined if the disbursements for&#13;
administrative overheads are out of proportion to the number of sub-projects. The level of FAS&#13;
operating expenditures was discussed at negotiations and will be reviewed during implementation&#13;
for its appropriateness. As Provincial Offices gain experience, they are tackling larger projects.&#13;
Operating costs are being reduced by using more medium-level staff for supervision, and these&#13;
costs may be further reduced by increasing the area of supervision each Provincial Office is&#13;
responsible for. There are no pre-set limits to the number of sub-projects that can be financed by&#13;
the FAS for each province or community.&#13;
2.38   Monitoring. Technical and financial monitoring is critical to successful sub-project&#13;
implementation. The FAS aims to maintain a high standard of transparency and accountability by&#13;
applying explicit and strict criteria for sub-project monitoring. Both physical reports and financial&#13;
progress reports containing justifications are submitted by the sponsor. Personnel from the FAS&#13;
supervise progress and assist in problem-solving.&#13;
2.39   A computerized system of management and performance indicators has been developed to&#13;
detail accounting and implementation information on each sub-project. Management indicators,&#13;
such as administrative costs per beneficiary, projects per vehicle, and running costs per&#13;
disbursement, are also monitored by the FAS. A local firm has been contracted to develop and&#13;
operate a reliable and cost effective accounting system, independent of any decisions about sub-&#13;
project financing. Reports from the accounting system are used for financial monitoring by FAS,&#13;
auditors and IDA.&#13;
2.40   The Provincial Offices will submit monthly progress reports, generated by this&#13;
computerized system, to the NCU. (In future it may be possible to use a network system for the&#13;
entire process.) This reporting system allows the NCU to monitor implementation of sub-projects&#13;
and serves as an early waming system. The NCU compiles these reports and submits quarterly&#13;
reports to IDA, other donors and members of the NBO.&#13;
2.41   The FAS will employ indicators to monitor all the steps of the sub-project cycle, including:&#13;
(a)    Inputs: disbursements, number of beneficiaries, number of workshops and desk&#13;
appraisal meetings;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
(b)    Process: involvement of district staff and communities, elapsed time between&#13;
benchmarks (application, desk appraisal, field appraisal, approval, allocations,&#13;
completion), speed of completion, technical quality of projects, average sub-&#13;
project cost/benefit, disbursements and administrative costs;&#13;
(c)    Outputs: number of ongoing projects, number of completed projects per type,&#13;
kilometers of road built, numbers of beneficiaries by age and sex, number of&#13;
provinces covered; and,&#13;
(d)    Sub-projects impact: evaluated through annual beneficiary assessments.&#13;
Examples of indicators are based on such results as number of beneficiaries,&#13;
impact on employment and incomes and impact on social indicators.&#13;
2.42   The draft Terms of Reference for the beneficiary assessments can be found in Annex K.&#13;
2.43   Completion. Sub-project completion is determined by the Provincial Office. Sub-projects&#13;
are considered complete if the conditions specified in the signed contract by the FAS and the&#13;
sponsor are met. For infrastructure sub-projects, this will entail the completion of works according&#13;
to the specified technical plans.&#13;
2.44   Cancellation. Sub-projects will be closed if the sponsor repeatedly neglects the conditions&#13;
set forth in the contract, fails to justify expenses or misuses funds. The sub-project will be closed&#13;
by the executive director on the proposal of the provincial director. National and Provincial&#13;
Boards of Overseers will be informed of all such closures and their justification. The Provincial&#13;
Office can accept the substitution of one sponsor by another as an alternative to closure. All&#13;
infractions against the law will be reported by the provincial director to the local authorities.&#13;
2.45   Information, Education, and Communication (aEC). The NCU coordinates IEC&#13;
activities promoting the FAS. A graphic artist and printing facilities have been contracted to&#13;
develop IEC materials on the FAS, and some materials are already being distributed to government&#13;
officials, local leaders, and NGOs. Provincial Offices organize community-level meetings and are&#13;
working with radio stations to disseminate information on the FAS in local languages. The&#13;
ongoing priority survey on living standards and annual impact evaluations will feed into future IEC&#13;
activities, particularly to better identify groups in need.&#13;
C. Poverty Monitoring Component&#13;
2.46   Information relevant to poverty or to the living conditions of the population in Angola is&#13;
scarce, scattered and incomplete. Basic socio-economic indicators are difficult to calculate,&#13;
making targeting and impact evaluation of poverty alleviation activities almost impossible. Data&#13;
collection and analysis are hampered as much by the security situation as by weak in-country&#13;
capacity. To direct poverty strategies and to guide the design and implementation of development&#13;
efforts, an integrated system for monitoring the living conditions of the population is needed. The&#13;
Government is aware of this and in 1993 created, through Ministerial Decree 017/DHR193, an&#13;
independent Poverty Monitoring Unit (PMU) within INE. However, the budget allocated does not&#13;
permit INE to fulfill this role. Nor do the current INE Statutes allow it to initiate sponsorship&#13;
arrangements with universities to strengthen its capacity, or to directly sell its services to&#13;
Government or other agencies to pay for operational costs. A draft ministerial decree modifying&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
the INE Statutes is about to be passed by the Council of Ministers. This decree will increase the&#13;
role and responsibility of the PMU and will link it directly to decision-making bodies. The unit will&#13;
thus become the Gabinete de Monitoriza,co das Condicoes de Vida da Popula,do (GMCVP) (see&#13;
organizational charts, Annex F).&#13;
2.47   The new Statutes will give the GMCVP the autonomy necessary to: a) directly hire local&#13;
and intemational consultants; b) contract assistance from local and foreign institutions; and c) be&#13;
hired directly by donors and other financial partners. The reception of a satisfactory legal opinion&#13;
stating that the draft ministerial decree modifying the INE Statutes has been approved is a&#13;
condition for disbursement of this component. At negotiations, the Government agreed that the&#13;
GMCVP will carry out the studies and surveys in accordance with terms of reference and time&#13;
tables acceptable to IDA, and will discuss the findings with IDA. When appropriate,&#13;
Government will prepare action plans to address issues which emerge from the findings of these&#13;
studies and surveys. The GMCVP's mandate is to support the country's capacity to monitor the&#13;
living conditions of the population by: (i) carrying out household and community surveys; (ii)&#13;
providing funds for other local institutions to carry out specific beneficiary and participatory&#13;
assessments, and (iii) maintaining a database on poverty.&#13;
2.48   The National Committee for Statistics, is the country's overseeing body for statistics. It&#13;
supervises and coordinates NE, other statistical operations and institutions in the country and the&#13;
sector's statistical sub-committees. In the coming months the Government will establish by&#13;
ministerial decree a Sub-committee for Information on Living Conditions of the Population&#13;
(SCILC) to coordinate research on poverty nationwide, support consensus building for defining&#13;
strategy and be the Government's consultative body for poverty issues.&#13;
Component Objectives&#13;
2.49   The Govemment has requested IDA to support, through the poverty monitoring component&#13;
of the SAP, its efforts to build the country's capacity to monitor the living conditions of the&#13;
population and apply that information for decision-making. Consequently, this component aims to:&#13;
(a)   strengthen the capacity of Angolan institutions to analyze data and make it&#13;
available in usable form to policymakers, through data dissemination, training and&#13;
development;&#13;
(b)    assist the effective targeting of poverty reduction interventions by supporting&#13;
research and studies focusing on policy-related poverty issues, and on the analysis&#13;
of the effects of social and economic policies on the vulnerable;&#13;
(c)    support the design and targeting of policies to alleviate poverty and improve the&#13;
population's welfare through the dissemination of research findings, and the&#13;
provision of training for Government officials and other institutions;&#13;
(d)    contribute towards a better knowledge of poverty issues through creating a data&#13;
base, disseminating and publishing statistical and other information on poverty,&#13;
and organizing workshops; and,&#13;
(e)    Provide methodological guidance to sector institutions involved in gathering&#13;
information and data on poverty, through providing technical support to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
preparation of survey documents, the processing of information, and the training&#13;
of personnel.&#13;
Implementation Description&#13;
2.50   The Government has proposed that day-to-day implementation of this component be&#13;
implemented through the GMCVP which will direct and monitor the following activities:&#13;
2.51 Household and Community Surveys. The Expenditure and Income Survey will take&#13;
place in 1996. For this survey the Credit will only finance long-term technical assistance and the&#13;
technical staff in place at GMCVP. The main objective of this survey is to update the weighting&#13;
for the consumer price index. Other objectives will be to produce data on household budgets for&#13;
the National Accounts, and to assess national and regional poverty. The survey will cover about&#13;
3,000 households over a 12-month period. The same sample of households will be followed each&#13;
quarter for expenditure and incomes. The questionnaire will allow application of specific modules&#13;
at each round to produce social as well as economic indicators. For comparison purposes, an extra&#13;
module on expenditure will be set up with the same specifications as the ones included in the&#13;
Priority survey on Living Conditions (IPCVD) performed recently'6.&#13;
2.52   A Second Priority Survey on Living Conditions (IPCVDH) will be implemented to&#13;
measure poverty trends over time. This second survey will employ the methodology used for the&#13;
first one. Except for the expenditure modules, the questionnaire will be modified in response to the&#13;
findings of the first IPCVP. The questionnaire will include modules on household composition,&#13;
education, health, employment, expenditure and assets. The questionnaire will use diaries to&#13;
collect expenditure data over a reference period. The questionnaire will be applied to a sample&#13;
between 6,000 to 8,000 households (according accessibility) in urban and rural areas. data&#13;
collection will be executed over a three-month period.&#13;
2.53   A self-standing Community Survey (CS) will be carried out in urban and rural&#13;
communities including the IPCVD sample. The objective of the CS is to provide information on:&#13;
(i) community infrastructures; (ii) access to essential public services; (iii) satisfaction of the&#13;
population with these services; (iv) employment environment; (v) environmental, community and&#13;
cultural constraints; and, (vi) local agricultural practices. The survey is essentially qualitative and&#13;
will allow cross-analysis and incidence-analysis between the micro level of the population and the&#13;
meso level of the public and the market. In rural areas prices are usually unavailable since most&#13;
price data collection is done at the level of the main urban centers. To correct this situation, the&#13;
survey will include a price module for collecting prices in the communities.&#13;
2.54   The Study Progranm  The GMCVP will receive funds to operate a study program on&#13;
poverty and living conditions. The studies will target Government and policymakers as well as the&#13;
donor community. Policymakers and donors will be closely associated with the choice of studies,&#13;
will decide the criteria for approving studies, will be able to mandate and initiate studies and will&#13;
make available all necessary data and information. All such actions will be initiated in the&#13;
framework of the SCILC.&#13;
16  In the framework of project preparation (and as input to the proposed poverty assessment) a household survey&#13;
was carried out by this unit in six provinces. The Priority Survey on Living Conditions (IPCVD) was adapted&#13;
from the World Bank Priority Survey for Measuring the Social Impact of Structural Adjustment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
2.55   With a general focus on poverty issues, the Study Program will provide funding for studies&#13;
centered on:&#13;
(a)    assessing current socioeconomic and social policies and social action programs;&#13;
(b)    identifying the most vulnerable groups and measuring their welfare; and&#13;
(c)    analyzing poverty issues.&#13;
2.56   Criteria for the studies as proposed in the procedures manual of the GMCVP (a draft of&#13;
which was reviewed at negotiations), will be agreed upon by the SCILC, INE's director, the Head&#13;
of Cabinet and the donors. The studies must have a general focus on poverty issues in Angola,&#13;
cost under US$50,000, and last not longer than 12 months. Only Angolan researchers and&#13;
institutions, alone or associated with foreign universities and research centers, will be eligible.&#13;
Angolan students from Master and Ph.D. courses at the Angola universities may apply for&#13;
sponsorship of studies under US$3,000.&#13;
2.57   Studies produced through the Study Fund will be reviewed by the Technical Review&#13;
Committee (TRC) for clearance. The TRC, an independent body, will also be involved in the&#13;
review of the studies' terms of reference before approval. The TRC will be a small group of&#13;
experienced Angolan researchers, and specialists in economics, health, education, demography,&#13;
urbanization and sociology.&#13;
2.58   Research sponsorship. The Project will support development of the capacity of local&#13;
researchers by encouraging partnerships between the GMCVP and foreign universities and&#13;
research centers, where foreign institutions sponsor the local partner. Sponsorship could take the&#13;
form of short-term training sessions given by members of these institutions, intermediary training&#13;
sessions (university courses) to improve skills in specific fields, or participatory support to analysis&#13;
and studies. The GMCVP will seek financial support for this sub-component from bilateral&#13;
donors, or will use study program funds.&#13;
2.59   Assessment of the social sectors statistical system. The GMCVP will assess the&#13;
availability and quality of the current production of statistics for the social sectors. This will&#13;
include relevant ministries and other public and private institutions. The GMCVP will produce a&#13;
report of this assessment, including recommendations for improvement.&#13;
2.60   Creation and maintenance of a database on poverty and related social issues. The&#13;
Poverty Monitoring Unit has reviewed all available studies relevant to welfare and poverty in the&#13;
social sector, and produced a bibliography and a summary of all studies. Under the supervision of&#13;
the GMCVP, INE's Information and Dissemination Division (normally in charge of the&#13;
documentation system) will continue to maintain and update this bibliography and database. A&#13;
package such as Geographic Management System will be installed to make the data base user-&#13;
friendly. The Credit will finance the software purchase and training for the staff.&#13;
2.61   Dissemination program. Together with the Cabinet, the membership of the SCILC will&#13;
facilitate wide dissemination of Project outputs to decisionmakers17. The success of the Project&#13;
will be measurable by the extent to which it changes the attitude of decisionmakers and mobilizes&#13;
efforts to address poverty. The Cabinet and the Sub-Committee will define a strategy for the&#13;
dissemination phase. This will include identification of the targeted audience; dissemination of&#13;
17  Decisionmakers need adequate and reliable statistics and information for sound policy design. The lack and&#13;
scarcity of such information, has so far delayed the development of an integrated system for decisionmaking.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
specific publications targeting specific or broad audiences; improvement of marketing skills for the&#13;
final presentation of data; programming workshops and seminars, community participatory group&#13;
sessions; and use of the media to improve transparency in the process of poverty monitoring.&#13;
2.62   To perform these various activities the Credit willfinance technical assistance to support&#13;
the survey program in sampling, data processing and analysis"5. The GMCVP will receive&#13;
technical assistance in management of funds (procurement, disbursement) and computerized&#13;
information for the Project. The GMCVP will provide technical support to the researchers. In&#13;
addition to on-the-job training to be provided through technical assistance activities, study trips&#13;
will be organized for staff involved in the execution of the Project. Permanent staff and&#13;
researchers of the Project will participate in seminars and workshops at which they will&#13;
disseminate information generated by the Project. The Credit will finance four fellowships in&#13;
public management, economics and social development. Before each survey, training sessions in&#13;
data collection and processing will be organized for field staff. The Credit will finance a study&#13;
fund for poverty-related studies and workshops. Finally the Credit will finance office equipment&#13;
including computers and printers, vehicles (two cars and 20 motorcycles), software and office&#13;

communication, transportation) and publications.&#13;
Component Structure&#13;
2.63   GMCVP. The unit will be composed of three professionals competent in economics,&#13;
statistics, demography and sociology, supported by a computer specialist. The Head of Cabinet&#13;
will lead the team and will be supported by a Unit Management Team, composed of one&#13;
administrator, one expert in accounting, one assistant, and two support staff. During negotiations&#13;
the Government has agreed that the qualifications and terms of reference of GMCVP staff as&#13;
well as their numbers will have to be acceptable to IDA throughout project implementation.&#13;
Consultant staff will be hired on a short-term basis. The UnitManagement Team will issue&#13;
contracts and execute salary payments.&#13;
2.64   The GMCVP reports to INE's director and [NE's Administrative Board. INE's director&#13;
will closely supervise and monitor the activities and the management of the GMCVP and will&#13;
provide technical support, collaborate on the definition of conceptual issues, and promote the work&#13;
program of GMCVP outside INE. The GMCVP will meet at least once a month with INE's&#13;
director and quarterly with the SCIILC to review the GMCVP's work program, analyze requests&#13;
for funds from the study program and assess the activities and the quality of outputs of the&#13;
GMCVP. Experts may be called to assist these meetings. Activities and projects executed by and&#13;
through the GMCVP may be financed or co-financed by other donors or institutions. UNICEF has&#13;
expressed interest in providing parallel financing for this component.&#13;
2.65   SCILC. The Sub-comnmittee will provide technical support in non-statistical matters to the&#13;
GMCVP and will guarantee the relevancy and adequacy of its program for improving the general&#13;
welfare of the population. It will also support the incorporation of study findings in Government's&#13;
poverty-alleviation strategies. The Sub-committee will include representatives from a)&#13;
governmental organizations such as sector ministries and universities; and, b) non-governmental&#13;
organizations, such as major NGOs, churches, UN agencies, FAS, labor unions and employers&#13;
associations. Small NGOs and bilateral agencies, will rotate membership to ensure the&#13;
participation of all stakeholders. To be able to fully support the GMCVP, the Sub-committee&#13;
Is See delailed budget in Annex G.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
members will have an adequate technical background. Terms of reference for the representatives&#13;
will be stated in the decree creating the Sub-committee.&#13;
D. Status of Project Preparation&#13;
2.66   The status of project preparation differs between the two project components. While the&#13;
FAS is being fully implemented now, the Poverty Monitoring component needs to set up&#13;
administrative structures that will ensure smooth project implementation, and needs to formalize&#13;
the legal framework for its work.&#13;
2.67   For the FAS component, both a Special Account for the PPF and a Project Account have&#13;
been set up. At both the national and provincial levels, Government has placed financial and&#13;
logistical resources at the disposal of the FAS that match the required ten percent of Government&#13;
counterpart funds. During negotiations, agreement was reached for the provision by&#13;
Government of adequate counterpartfunding.&#13;
2.68   The following actions have been taken: a) IDA has received a legal opinion from the&#13;
Attomey General confirming that the FAS is correctly constituted and is legal, valid and binding&#13;
under the Laws of Angola in accordance with its terms; b) the first audit has been completed and&#13;
the results submitted to the NBO and to IDA; c) non-governmental representation has been&#13;
included in the National and Provincial Boards of Overseers; and c) the equivalent 10 percentage&#13;
of the disbursed PPF has been paid into the Project Account by Government.&#13;
2.69   For the Poverty Monitoring component, the draft ministerial decree modifying INE's&#13;
Statutes has been presented to the Council of Ministers; approval is expected in the first quarter of&#13;
1996. 1INE has presented a satisfactory first draft of the manual of procedures for the GMCVP.&#13;
While the Poverty Monitoring Unit has proved its capacity to manage funds of around&#13;
US$200,000 it has encountered delays while implementing IDA-funded surveys. Appraisal&#13;
revealed the Unit's organizational and administrative weaknesses, and poor staff knowledge of&#13;
IDA procedures. The Unit will be reinforced with an administrator trained in IDA procedures.&#13;
INE has presented to IDA a dossier for hiring the administrative and managerial personnel needed&#13;
for the smooth operation of the GMCVP, as well as plans to set up an accounting system in&#13;
accordance with IDA standards. IDA contracting documents are already being used. During&#13;
negotiations Government agreed that since appointment of an experienced administrator with&#13;
qualifications, skills, and experience and on terms of reference satisfactory to IDA to staff the&#13;
unit, and adoption of a manual of procedures satisfactory to IDA, are both fundamental to&#13;
smooth component implementation, both measures are made conditions of disbursement for this&#13;
component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
E. Sustainability&#13;
FAS&#13;
2.70   This Project is designed to help the country through its transition phase. Although an&#13;
extension of the FAS beyond the life of the Project is likely, it is expected that the total life of the&#13;
FAS will not exceed eight to ten years. At the midterm review of the Project, preliminary views on&#13;
extension of the FAS beyond the initial four years will be formulated. Irrespective of any decision&#13;
to extend the FAS, the philosophy of self-help and the procedures and criteria developed to&#13;
implement and support community initiatives will remain in place. The skills leamed by&#13;
communities during the Project to use and account for funds and build, rehabilitate and maintain&#13;
infrastructure will be sustained by the communities themselves. Working together in the provincial&#13;
Board of Overseers will give provincial authorities a closer knowledge of the FAS, facilitating&#13;
future cooperation.&#13;
2.71   Financing recurrent costs is a persistent challenge. The responsibility for ensuring that&#13;
sufficient financing is made available lies with the sub-project sponsors. Public revenue remains a&#13;
critical source of financing of recurrent costs for projects, especially for health and education&#13;
infrastructure. Before approval, sub-projects have to include proof of the Government's&#13;
commitment to fund the operation and maintenance of public facilities rehabilitated under the&#13;
Project. User fees are another potential source of revenues: health services and water and&#13;
sanitation are good examples. However, this requires developed institutional capacity within the&#13;
sponsoring group and willingness to pay from the public. Both must be carefully verified before&#13;
project approval, and be subsequently monitored by NCU and IDA. During the pilot phase, the&#13;
average total investment costs per direct beneficiary has been US$5.54 (see Annex 0). The&#13;
rehabilitated structures are calculated to last about 10 years with basic maintenance and without&#13;
major repairs. During the pilot phase, sub-project incremental recurrent costs averaged US$0.28&#13;
per year per direct beneficiary. That figure represents around 1/900 of the GNP per capita. These&#13;
figures consider only direct beneficiaries, not the whole community. Even in the difficult situation&#13;
of Angolan communities, this seemns affordable. The comnmunities themselves demand the&#13;
rehabilitation of the infrastructures and are helping in this work. The FAS will mainly rehabilitate&#13;
existing infrastructures. Since these are staffed already, incremental costs for the relevant&#13;
Ministries will be minimal.&#13;
2.72   Sustainability of the infrastructure sub-projects is assured because the community&#13;
implementing the sub-project has contributed substantially to it and has a strong sense of&#13;
ownership. Every sub-project has an established and functioning maintenance committee. Since&#13;
government agencies are involved with the development and the implementation of each social&#13;
sector sub-project from the beginning, the sustainability of service delivery is enhanced. All sub-&#13;
projects are appraised for financial sustainability. Sustainability of previously implemented sub-&#13;
projects is an important criterion for approval of a proposal for a further sub-project by the same&#13;
sponsor or the same community.&#13;
2.73   Sustainability of the revenue-generating sub-projects is assured by the development of a&#13;
sound business plan at the conception of the sub-project, the sub-project's obvious value for the&#13;
beneficiary, and the beneficiary's sense of ownership of this private enterprise.&#13;
Poverty Monitoring&#13;
2.74   The GMCVP will be sustained through the institutional strengthening of the ME. The&#13;
establishment of INE's new structure, which is stated in the proposed draft Statutes of INE, is a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
prerequisite for ensuring that sustainability. By the end of the Project, the GMCVP will have&#13;
proved itself a capable institution producing policy-relevant outputs. The GMCVP will gradually&#13;
become independent of project subsidization, as other institutions in and outside government fund&#13;
data collection operations and studies. This independence is expected to be achieved through the&#13;
GMCVP becoming an efficiently operating unit associated in joint ventures with other donors as&#13;
well as through public and private institutions hiring its services.&#13;
F. Special Project Issues&#13;
2.75   Environmental issues. The environmental rating of the Project is a C, that is, no major&#13;
environmental effects are expected and no environmental assessment is necessary. No significant&#13;
negative impact from the infrastructure sub-projects is expected: these are mainly concemed with&#13;
rehabilitation, not new construction. Anthropologists and dryland ecologists will support the FAS&#13;
staff in the development of sub-project approval criteria for the arid and semi-arid areas of&#13;
southem Angola, especially for water projects.&#13;
2.76   Waste management will be an important part of some urban sub-projects. Overall the&#13;
Project will have a positive effect on the environment because of the strong focus on water,&#13;
sanitation and waste management in the infrastructure rehabilitation sub-projects.&#13;
2.77   Poverty category. The Project is part of the core poverty program for Angola and is&#13;
included in the program of targeted interventions. The beneficiaries of the FAS are primarily&#13;
women and children living in poor peri-urban and rural areas in which basic social, economic and&#13;
productive infrastructure has been severely damaged by war and lack of maintenance. The people&#13;
will benefit from increased access to schools, health facilities, and water points. Communities&#13;
living in these same areas will in general benefit from the FAS activities through improvement of&#13;
roads, markets and sanitation conditions, and greater access to funds for small investments.&#13;
G. Evaluation, Reviews and Reporting&#13;
FAS&#13;
2.78   Evaluation. The Project is subject to extemal annualfinancial and managerial audits,&#13;
the first of which took place during the FAS pilot phase. For the FAS, technical audits will take&#13;
place on a stratified sampling basis, with representative samples for every area of intervention.&#13;
These will review the FAS effectiveness and procedures as well as technical quality and&#13;
sustainability. The audits will also review sponsor procedures to evaluate sub-project outcomes.&#13;
Financial audits will be undertaken using established standard procedures.&#13;
2.79   Impact evaluation through systematic client consultation will be performed annually by an&#13;
outside agency to be selected through a short list.'9 This will assess the impact of project activities&#13;
in the comnmunities, with special emphasis on the poor and women. Participatory methodologies&#13;
(such as beneficiary assessments) will be used. The first such evaluation is scheduled to take place&#13;
in August 1996. An overview of the scheduled evaluations is in Annex L.&#13;
19  At least one NGO in the country has the capacity to perform this type of evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
2.80   The results of all evaluations will be incorporated in the Project strategy. The aim is to&#13;
have a flexible FAS accountable to the beneficiaries and responding to the dynamics of the&#13;
Angolan transition.&#13;
2.81   Review. To incorporate the results of evaluations and to permit IDA to remain abreast&#13;
of what is going on in the Project as a whole, reviews will be held on a semi-annual basis.&#13;
Reviews will include a record of Government's commitment to operate and maintain public&#13;
facilities rehabilitated under the Project in a manner acceptable to IDA. For these reviews, a&#13;
number of monitoring indicators have been developed. These stem from the FAS Management&#13;
Information System, and from the financial and technical audits and impact evaluations (see Annex&#13;
L). Project impact and performance indicators (Annex H) give an overview of the Project, linking&#13;
inputs, outputs and outcomes of the Project to its objectives. If telecommunications develop as&#13;
expected, the system may be accessed directly from Washington DC. The detailed supervision&#13;
schedule can be found in Annex I.&#13;
2.82   At negotiations Government agreed to undertake a midterm review not less than 24&#13;
months, and not more than 30 months after the Project becomes effective, or when 50 percent of&#13;
funds have been disbursed, whichever comes first, after which the Government will present a&#13;
plan acceptable to IDA for the further implementation of the Project. Participants in the midterm&#13;
review include the Bank, the NCU and provincial managers, the National and Provincial Boards of&#13;
Overseers, and other stakeholders. A document prepared by the NCU summarizing experience to&#13;
date, problems encountered and solutions found, will be the basis of discussion. Other inputs will&#13;
be the results of recent audits and evaluations and a summary of FAS reports to the Bank. The&#13;
review will help to redefine and adapt the FAS strategy and to formulate preliminary ideas on&#13;
extension of the Project beyond the initial 4 years. Participants in the semi-annual reviews include&#13;
the Bank, the NCU and the National Board of Overseers. Discussions will be based on the&#13;
combined FAS reports to the Bank.&#13;
2.83   Reporting. The NCU reports to the Bank on a quarterly basis. The reports focus on&#13;
specific issues that have arisen in implementation for which policy guidance is required (see Annex&#13;
J for an outline). Reports are timed to the review schedule.&#13;
Poverty Monitoring&#13;
2.84   Evaluation. For the GMCVP, financial and managerial evaluations will be performed&#13;
annually by the same firm and at the same time as for the FAS. The agency will evaluate GMCVP&#13;
efficiency and adequacy of procedures. Technical evaluation will not be performed as part of the&#13;
annual audits. However, there will be regular IDA missions to guarantee the technical quality of&#13;
the studies at all times. Financial audits will be executed using established standard procedures.&#13;
2.85   Review and supervision. IDA will perform semi-annual technical supervision of the&#13;
Poverty Monitoring component. Supervision will include agreement on a yearly program for the&#13;
GMCVP. Efforts will be made to overlap with the FAS review. Before a supervision mission, the&#13;
Unit Management at GMCVP will produce a report on progress to date. For the Household&#13;
Surveys, IDA missions will visit Angola to verify that the implementation complies with the design&#13;
and recommendations of the experts. These visits will enable close follow-up of the Project to&#13;
avoid or to solve major technical and administrative problems that may arise. IDA will ensure&#13;
three missions per survey, at such critical points as, the preparation of the design of the survey&#13;
documents, the organization of the field and data processing work, the pilot tests, the data&#13;
processing stage and the analysis stage. These visits will complement the regular technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
assistance directly provided through the Project. Reports produced by technical assistance&#13;
missions will support supervision and evaluation of project component implementation. Technical&#13;
supervision of the Study Program will be done through review of the studies before publication.&#13;
IDA will provide comments and recommendations. For important studies such as the Poverty&#13;
Profiles or for studies with a deep impact on policy design, the Bank will have experts review the&#13;
findings. At negotiations the Government agreed to grant public access to all information from&#13;
surveys and studies funded by the proceeds of the Credit.&#13;
2.86   To monitor this project component, performance indicators have been established with&#13;
INE. The production of the sampling design, the final questionnaire, manuals, and the report on&#13;
the survey's main results are typical milestones. For the Study Program, progress at the technical&#13;
level will be measured through the clearances and quality assessments of the studies by the TCR&#13;
and IDA. The percentage of studies approved by the partners and the proportion of studies&#13;
completed will indicate of the efficiency of the Study Program. This will be complemented by&#13;
measuring the percentage of studies used in policy decisions, project designs, project evaluations or&#13;
project improvement. For an overview of these indicators, see Annex H.&#13;
2.87   A midterm review will be held concurrently with the FAS midterm review. For this&#13;
component, participants in the midterm review will be IDA, the Administrative Board of the INE,&#13;
the GMCVP and other stakeholders, Input to this review will consist of the annual reports of the&#13;
GMCVP, updated to the date of the review.&#13;
2.88   Reporting. The GMCVP will produce annual reports on its achievements together with&#13;
quarterly financial reports. These reports, including the work program for the coming year, will be&#13;
presented and discussed during a meeting with participating donors and the Ministry of Planning.&#13;
The reports will highlight issues that have arisen in implementation for which guidance is required.&#13;
The outline of these reports is presented in Annex J.&#13;

3. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND&#13;
DISBURSEMENT&#13;
A. Costs&#13;
3 .1    The total cost of the Project is US$51.9 million equivalent. This includes about US$3.5&#13;
and US$0.8 million in operating costs for the FAS and GMCVP respectively. The size of the FAS&#13;
component is calculated by appraising, at the pilot phase, the capacity of communities and the FAS&#13;
to complete on-going sub-projects and process new applications, respectively. The cost tables for&#13;
this component are based on an acceptable minimum pace of 24 projects per province per semester&#13;
(1 new sub-project per week); with an acceptable maximum operating cost burden of 10 percent&#13;
once that pace is achieved (for a total of 11 percent of total sub-project costs), given an average&#13;
estimate of US$18,000 per project. The FAS investment will then be US$41 million equivalent&#13;
over 4 years. The nominal exchange rate is assumed to adjust during the life of the Project so as to&#13;
maintain a constant real exchange rate.&#13;

3.2    Incremental operating costs of the FAS have not been shown on a declining basis, because&#13;
its sustainability is not an issue in itself. Incremental operating costs which arise out of the&#13;
Project's activities (operating costs for rehabilitated health and education facilities, for example),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
must be addressed in all sub-project proposals. Where Government contribution is implied&#13;
(staffing, for example), commitment must be obtained before the approval of a sub-project. The&#13;
incremental recurrent costs arising from maintenance and operation of such facilities and works are&#13;
not considered part of the project costs. For GMCVP the financing of incremental operating costs&#13;
will be done on a declining basis as indicated in Table 3.3.&#13;

small amount is intended for the costs of adninustration assocated vith expansica of adivities.&#13;
3.3      The total costs for the Project will be financed as follows: IDA will fund 46 percent of&#13;
total project costs; communities will provide 10-20 percent of sub-project costs through their&#13;
contributions in labor, in cash and in kind; this has been estimated at an average of 15 percent and&#13;
may include contributions by NGOs, churches and local authorities; Government will fund five&#13;
percent of the overall project costs. Every year, counterpart funding totaling 5 percent of estimated&#13;
disbursement (Table 3.4), will be budgeted, in US$ equivalent, in the Government of Angola's&#13;
Annual Budget Exercise, and disbursed quarterly to the Project Account. At the end of the fiscal&#13;
year, counterpart funding will be reviewed to match the Project's actual disbursement. In addition,&#13;
Government will ensure the operation of public facilities rehabilitated under the Project, through&#13;
yearly budgetary allocations, and the provision of personnel (teachers, nurses). Co-financing is&#13;
being sought for about US$18.3 million to finance sub-projects and some operating costs. At the&#13;
United Nations Round Table on Angola, held September 25 to 29, 1995 Government and the FAS&#13;
technical team presented the SAP as one of the preferred channels for community financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Several governments expressed interest. During the first quarter of 1996, the borrower, IDA and&#13;
representatives of these govemments will meet to confirm parallel financing arrangements. The&#13;
extent of co-financing will ultimately determine the scale and timing of the Project. Since FAS&#13;
operating costs are financed through the IDA Credit, Project implementation is independent from&#13;
co-financing.&#13;
3.4    Operating costs of the Project administration will be bome by Government (22%), IDA&#13;
(77%) and other donors (I %). These costs encompass the hiring of FAS staff, and setting up of&#13;
new Provincial Offices, office equipment and vehicles, running costs, stationery, water, light and&#13;
fuel. Taxes and duties apply only to imported goods and range from 5%-25%. These have been&#13;
estimated at an average value of 18%, with a resulting impact of about 2% in the total project&#13;
costs. This amount is not included within the estimated project costs. As in other projects in&#13;
Angola, the Ministry of Finance has provided the FAS with an official exemption of duties on&#13;
FAS-financed purchases. However it remains the responsibility of the implementing agencies to&#13;
exercise these exemptions and where not realized, to ensure that an additional Government&#13;
contribution is made to cover any taxes and duties that arise from this project.&#13;
3.5    Given the magnitude and anticipated pace of the FAS, it is important that there be a&#13;
unified set of procedures for project selection, disbursement, procurement and contracting, to&#13;
which all co-financiers must agree. All major co-financiers will be invited to participate on the&#13;
semi-annual national work plans, which will include financing and procurement plans.&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
3.6    The exact mix of goods and services to be financed by the Credit will depend on the&#13;
identification of demand-driven sub-projects. The focus has been on streamlining the process, not&#13;
on determining exact quantities. Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 3.4.&#13;
Procurement will be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines, Procurement Under IBRD&#13;
Loans and IDA Credits, dated January 1995, with emphasis on section 3.15, Community&#13;
Participation. Contracts financed by other co-financiers are expected to follow FAS procurement&#13;
procedures which are consistent with those of IDA.&#13;
3.7    The following steps have been taken to ensure that the procurement of goods and works&#13;
under this Project is consistent with the principles of competition while ensuring the participation&#13;
of provincial and local contractors: (a) a civil engineer has been hired by the NCU to design&#13;
standard technical specifications and to supervise procurement by the provincial offices and NCB&#13;
or ICB when needed; (b) national staff have received training in IDA procurement procedures; (c)&#13;
technical assistance by a procurement specialist will be provided to assist in the preparation of&#13;
quarterly implementation plans; (d) simplified standard bidding documents have been developed to&#13;
be employed for all provincial and local competitive bidding; and (e) standard technical&#13;
specifications and bills of quantities, including standard plans drawn up by sector ministries, will&#13;
be used whenever possible. All procedures have been tested in the pilot phase with satisfactory&#13;
results. Procedures will still be reviewed regularly for clarity and simplicity (many of the&#13;
contractors are semi-literate), effectiveness and efficiency. To date, the pilot appears to be&#13;
supporting a competitive process with a sufficient number of small contractors participating.&#13;

Note 1: Figures in brackets indicate IDA financing&#13;
Note 2: Other methods acceptable to IDA are:&#13;
a   Single-source procurement of goods from IAPSO, and&#13;
b   National shopping for local salaries and other local qoeratlng costs.&#13;
3.8      Nucleos comunitarios are responsible for most procurement under the FAS-financed sub-&#13;
projects with support from the sponsor agency or the Provincial FAS office. All contracts are&#13;
signed between the nucleo comunitario and the contractor or supplier, but payments are made by&#13;
the Fund directly to the supplier (on the beneficiary's written order). Monitoring and audit&#13;
procedures for procurement by sub-project committees follow the guidelines detailed in the FAS&#13;
Procedures and Administrative Manuals. The NCU manages the procurement of any acquisition of&#13;
sub-project materials over US$50,000 equivalent. The NCU is responsible for the procurement of&#13;
goods and services outside sub-projects, up to an aggregate amount of US$4.03 million.&#13;
3.9      International competitive bidding (ICB). ICB will be carried out in accordance with&#13;
IDA guidelines for contracts of US$100,000 or more for goods. Domestic preference will be&#13;
employed where applicable in these procurements, as in IDA guidelines. ICB is unlikely to be used&#13;
for civil works, as most of the civil works contracts are small and scattered. ICB will primarily be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
followed in the bulk procurement of equipment and materials for sub-projects (such as water&#13;
pumps and teaching materials).&#13;
3.10   National competitive bidding (NCB). For works, NCB will be carried out for contracts&#13;
between US$50,000 and US$100,000, and for goods (including school and health post equipment),&#13;
for contracts between US$20,000 and US$100,000. This category is not expected to exceed&#13;
US$5.69 million total over the life of the project. US$4.67 million equivalent will be for goods&#13;
(including school and health post equipment), and US$1.02 million equivalent for civil works.&#13;
3.11 Community-based procurement Civil works and goods for sub-projects up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$13.17 million, can be procured on the basis of three written quotations.&#13;
To encourage participation of small and local firms, the FAS is advertising (posting) in advance&#13;
articipated sub-projects in the community, in its offices, and in the national and provincial&#13;
electronic and print media. This has been helpful in preventing shortages of construction materials&#13;
in the provinces by allowing suppliers to anticipate demand.&#13;
3.12   About 2,000 scattered contracts for civil works, for amounts between US$5,000 to&#13;
US$50,000, consisting of primary schools, health posts, dams, small roads, markets, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$10.36 million, are expected. In the pilot phase, the average contract has&#13;
been valued at about US$20,000. Community groups will engage qualified small local contractors&#13;
selected on the basis of at least three written quotations. Standard technical specifications will be&#13;
used wherever possible. Techniques of construction that favor community contribution (which will&#13;
typically consist of materials and labor) will be preferred. The FAS will not become a wholesale&#13;
supplier of goods nor will it become the implementing agency on behalf of community groups.&#13;
3.13   Procurement of goods will consist mostly of equipment, furniture and materials for schools&#13;
and health posts. About 1,000 such contracts will financed by IDA, each valued between&#13;
US$5,000 and US$20,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate amount of US$2.81 million.&#13;
3.14   Other methods acceptable to IDA. Lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the&#13;
basis of quotation obtained from at least three qualified domestic contractors in response to a&#13;
written invitation, may be used to procure civil works under US$50,000 for the establishment of&#13;
the FAS offices in the provinces up to an aggregated amount of US$200,000. Prudent national&#13;
shopping, up to an aggregated amount of US$1.15 million, may be used for transport and fuel as&#13;
well as for certain FAS investments for goods under US$20,000 for up to an aggregate of US$1&#13;
million and for office furniture supplies and fuel for the GMCVP up to US$150,000. Direct&#13;
purchases may be made from IAPSO, provided that prices are competitive, for vehicles and office&#13;
equipment, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.3 million.&#13;
3.15   Consultant services. Selection and appointment of consultants and other services will be&#13;
carried out in accordance with "Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by&#13;
the World Bank as Executing Agency " (August, 1981). For the FAS component, this category&#13;
includes the FAS staff and consultants, up to an aggregate amount of US$3.73 million. Sub-&#13;
project implementation may require consultants to assist with technical design and, in some cases,&#13;
technical supervision. A total of about 200 such contracts will take place, for amounts between&#13;
US$1,500 and US$5,000, up to an aggregate amount of US $1 mnillion. Registers of individuals to&#13;
be hired directly or through a consultant firm, will be listed to be invited to bid on these tasks.&#13;
These lists will be compiled in the Provincial Offices and in the NCU. It was agreed at&#13;
negotiations that whenever possible these contracts would be aggregated. For the poverty&#13;
monitoring component, this category includes TA and GMCVP staff hired on six-month contracts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
and local consultants. About 100 contracts for amounts between US$1,500 and US$100,000 are&#13;
expected for an aggregate amount of US$2.38 million.&#13;
3.16   Tender documentationformat IDA's standard bidding documents will be used for all&#13;
ICB financed by the Credit. For NCB, Government has prepared standard documentation&#13;
acceptable to IDA (included in the FAS Manuals). During negotiations it was agreed that when&#13;
applicable (contracts and NCB) the GMCVP will use documents similar to the FAS. Community&#13;
participation will use simplified standard bidding documents developed during project preparation.&#13;
These documents will also be employed for all provincial and local competitive bidding. For the&#13;
FAS, these documents are contained in the FAS Procedures Manuals which were reviewed and&#13;
agreed upon at negotiations.&#13;
3.17   Procurement rewiw. All ICB packages will be submitted for prior review by IDA. All&#13;
financed consultant contracts above US$50,000 equivalent for firms and US$20,000 equivalent for&#13;
individual consultants, and all sole-source contracts will be submitted for prior review. The terms&#13;
of reference for all consultants and for studies will be submitted to IDA for technical review. All&#13;
other contracts will be subject to selective post review. FAS and the GMCVP will be required to&#13;
maintain proper records to facilitate review by IDA.&#13;

3.18   It is estimated that the IDA Credit will be disbursed over 4 years, from January, 1996,&#13;
through December, 1999, with procurement and disbursement for sub-projects completed by June&#13;
30, 2000 (completion date). The closing date will be December, 2000. The proposed allocation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
the Credit is shown in Table 3.3. The estimated disbursement profile takes into account the&#13;
historical profile for decentralized social sector projects in the region, and the technical assistance&#13;
provided for improving procurement and accountability.&#13;
3.19   During negotiations, it was agreed that Government will ensure that all applications to&#13;
withdraw proceedsfrom the Credit be fully documented exceptfor expendituresfor training,&#13;
workshops, recurrent costs, andfor contracts with a value of US$I 00, 000 or lessfor goods and&#13;
civil works, andfor consultant services under USS50, 000forfirms and US$20, 000for&#13;
individualsfor which reimbursements are made against SOEs.&#13;
3.20   Disbursement procedures under the FAS are streamlined and decentralized to delegate&#13;
responsibility and accountability for funds to the lowest level of implementation. Funds are&#13;
advanced monthly to provincial FAS units on the basis of a quarterly work plan in accordance with&#13;
the semi-annual work program and funding requirement (SWP). This report will indicate the&#13;
activities to be undertaken each six months, the location (province, district), and appropriate&#13;
measurable indicators of progress. To ensure that the funds advanced are used only for the&#13;
purposes intended, the FAS has put in place comprehensive monitoring and evaluation&#13;
arrangements reviewed during appraisal and deemed acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.21   If co-financiers are found, financing and disbursement arrangements under the FAS will be&#13;
determined each semester in accordance with the SWP, which is to be prepared by the central FAS&#13;
and agreed to by all donors. Separate special accounts for each donor will be opened in a&#13;
commercial bank acceptable to IDA and the donors.&#13;

3.22   Each provincial FAS unit will also open a separate bank account into which advances will&#13;
be made from the Special Account (SA) according to the funding needs identified in the SWP. At&#13;
least once a month, the provincial FAS will submit replenishment applications to the NCU with&#13;
appropriate supporting documents. Such applications will be submitted monthly. Funds for&#13;
headquarters activities will be retained in the central Special Accounts.&#13;
3.23   For the GMCVP, requests for replenishment of the SA will normally be submitted to IDA&#13;
every month, but no later than every three months. Withdrawal applications for direct payment&#13;
from the Credit account will be submitted for expenditures above 20 percent for the SA&#13;
(US$20,000 equivalent).&#13;
3.24   Each provincial FAS unit submits simplified statements of expenditures (SOEs) to the&#13;
NCU no later than 3 months after the advances were made. The NCU will not make further&#13;
advances to decentralized units until a proper accounting of the use of previous advances has been&#13;
submitted. The simplified SOEs summarize the expenditures by category and by source of&#13;
financing (IDA or donors). Documents supporting expenditures below the limits indicated are&#13;

E. Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.25   A SA with an authorized allocation of US$1.5 million representing four months of average&#13;
project expenditures for the FAS component, has already been established in a commercial bank&#13;
acceptable to IDA. During the initial period of implementation, when disbursement will be slower,&#13;
the special account initial deposit will be US$750,000. After the aggregate disbursement of the&#13;
project reaches US$5 million, the balance of the authorized allocation will be disbursed into this&#13;
SA. A second SA, for the disbursements under the Poverty Monitoring component of the Project,&#13;
with an authorized allocation of US$200,000 will be established in a commercial bank acceptable&#13;
to IDA. For this second account, the initial deposit will be US$100,000. After the aggregate&#13;
disbursement of the project reaches US$1 million, the balance of the authorized allocation will be&#13;
disbursed into this second SA. Requests for replenishment of both SA will normally be submitted&#13;
to IDA every month, but no later than every three months. Withdrawal applications for direct&#13;
payment from the Credit accounts may be submitted for expenditures above 20 percent of each SA.&#13;
The Government has opened a local currency account for its counterpart financing of the FAS&#13;
component with an initial deposit of US$60,000 equivalent. The Government will establish an&#13;
account in local currency, in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA, for counterpart funding of&#13;
the GMCVP, with an initial deposit of US$5, 000 equivalent. The establishment of this account&#13;
with a deposit of US$5, 000 equivalent is a condition for disbursement offunds under the Poverty&#13;
Monitoring component.&#13;
3.26   Audit. Government performance in auditing Project Accounts in Angola has generally&#13;
been acceptable, and Government is in full compliance on other social sector projects. The quality&#13;
of the audits has been satisfactory. A firm acceptable to IDA has already carried out a financial&#13;
and managerial audit of the FAS activities during project preparation. The audit was completed on&#13;
time, but was qualified because of the organization of the paper accounts before the installation of&#13;
the accounting system. The assessment was generally favorable and measures have been&#13;
undertaken to implement the suggested improvements. An annual contract, to audit the FAS&#13;
component, renewable for five years, has been signed with the firm. The contract will be revised to&#13;
include auditing for the Poverty Monitoring component.&#13;
3.27   During negotiations, agreement was reached that Government will present to IDA audit&#13;
reports for the project, as soon as possible after the end of the Angolan financial year, but no&#13;
later than six months after its completion. These audits will report on the ProjectAccounts with&#13;
separate opinions on the use of each Special Account and on the Statements of Expenditures&#13;
(SOEs) for both components. A management letter will also be part of the audits. The audits&#13;
will be carried out by an independent auditingfirm, with proper qualifications (already&#13;
appointed) and under terms of reference acceptable to IDA. The costs of the audits are eligible&#13;
for financing out of the proceeds of the Credit. Audits will include technical and management&#13;
issues. The part of the audit report that refers to the FAS will include a review of the sponsor's&#13;
performance, and will be submitted simultaneously to the NBO of the FAS and to IDA.&#13;

4. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
FAS&#13;
4.1    Estimating the exact benefits of this type of project is difficult because activities (sub-&#13;
projects) are demand-driven, thus making it difficult to anticipate the project area, the total number&#13;
of beneficiaries, and the number and mix of project types. However, the pilot project experience&#13;
has provided some perspective on what might reasonably be expected from the FAS. Qualitative&#13;
outcomes can be demonstrated by case descriptions.&#13;
4.2    From projections from the pilot experience, it is estimated that the FAS will construct&#13;
approximately 230 new schools, rehabilitate over 680 existing schools, and provide the initial&#13;
investment in their equipment and supplies. This would result in increased access to (mostly)&#13;
primary education for approximately 450,000 children.&#13;
4.3    Similarly, it is estimated that the FAS will rehabilitate or construct around 450 health&#13;
posts. At an average of 800 patients per year, 350,000 people will benefit. Water supply will be&#13;
improved by various means in 200 sub-projects, benefiting 50,000 people. An additional 120&#13;
latrines will improve living conditions for 50,000 Angolans. Various other projects, such as&#13;
laundries, roads, bridges, irrigation works, markets and other infrastructure works will improve&#13;
economic access and living conditions for approximately 300,000 people. By enabling the rapid&#13;
rehabilitation and construction of basic social infrastructure, FAS will directly improve living&#13;
conditions for at least 10 percent of the Angolan population. The main beneficiaries of the projects&#13;
are children (43 percent) and women (33 percent).&#13;
4.4    The project has implications for improving community solidarity. Social forces in&#13;
communities, ranging from local authorities, to churches and neighborhood groups, cooperate&#13;
through FAS sub-projects to improve the living conditions of the community. The result is a&#13;
rekindled spirit of self-reliance, an increased sense of ownership, and an increased feeling of&#13;
"community" in this war-tom country. In several projects implemented under the pilot,&#13;
communities began preparing for the rehabilitation of facilities (carrying stones, leveling the&#13;
ground) even before the sub-project was approved.&#13;
4.5    The FAS has become a platform for donor co-ordination. One example is the proposal to&#13;
construct school canteens for a whole province, that has required the coordination of inputs from&#13;
parent's associations, UNICEF (tables and kitchen materials) and the World Food Program (food).&#13;
4.6    There is the increased capacity of community-based organizations, local, provincial and&#13;
national government and NGOs to plan, appraise and complete capital projects. As groups become&#13;
familiar with the FAS, and as promotional materials are distributed, the time-span between sub-&#13;
project preparation and approval is being shortened.&#13;
Poverty Monitoring&#13;
4.7    The main benefit an'sing from the Poverty Monitoring component will be improved&#13;
knowledge, through 3 large national surveys and several smaller studies, of the Angolan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
population's living conditions. Besides increasing the capacity for research and planning in&#13;
Angola, these activities will vastly improve the capacity for policymaking within Angola to target&#13;
programs and policies to the poor and vulnerable. Since these surveys and studies will establish&#13;
important benchmarks against which to assess changes in the living conditions of different social&#13;
groups, an improved capacity to evaluate such programs and policies for poverty reduction impact&#13;
is required and expected.&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
FAS&#13;
4.8    The main risks are:&#13;
(a)    That the political and military situation deteriorates again, making it impossible to&#13;
implement the project, or for communities to undertake their activities.&#13;
Expectations within and outside the country for sustaining the recent peace&#13;
agreement suggest that the return to war is unlikely, even in that unhappy event,&#13;
the current FAS structure allows for the continuation of activities even if in limited&#13;
areas of the country.&#13;
(b)    That decentralization of the FAS will result in a FAS management not capable of&#13;
implementing the project as expected. That risk is being reduced through&#13;
performance incentives and training. The risk of political interference is reduced&#13;
through FAS autonomy and the participation of a wide spectrum of agents on its&#13;
NBO;&#13;
(c)    That poor technical quality of the works could undermine the sustainability of the&#13;
sub-projects and community participation. This is being addressed by the&#13;
budgeting for significant inputs into technical monitoring and supervision;&#13;
(d)    That the Govemment of Angola may fail to meet its financial commitments to the&#13;
project. Govemment allocated in the 1994 and 1995 budgets sufficient&#13;
counterpart funds for the FAS. During the pilot phase the Govemment has&#13;
honored its commitment without default. At negotiations, agreement was reached&#13;
as to the amount of Govemment semi-annual contributions to the FAS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Poverty Monitoring&#13;
4.9    The risks associated with the GMCVP are:&#13;
(a)    That administrative and managerial weakness will not allow this organization to&#13;
properly administer and implement the studies and surveys. This issue has been&#13;
addressed by including as conditions of disbursement for this component: a) the&#13;
appointment of an experienced administrator with qualifications, skills and&#13;
experience and on terms of reference satisfactory to IDA; b) the adoption of a&#13;
manual of procedures satisfactory to IDA to regulate the fumctioning of the unit&#13;
and establish criteria for the disbursement of the Study Fund. GMCVP may hire&#13;
an accounting firm to set-up an accounting system acceptable to IDA. The project&#13;
design ensures sufficient technical support to GMCVP during survey&#13;
implementation. Moreover, the existing Poverty Monitoring Unit has just&#13;
completed a national survey of size and complexity similar to the ones proposed.&#13;
(b)    That disbursement delays may hamper the schedule of the surveys as plarmed.&#13;
This problem occurred dunrng the first IPCVD because the PMU then had no&#13;
direct access to the survey funds. The risk has been minimized by increasing&#13;
autonomy through an independent Special Account;&#13;
(c)    That key staff (including trained researchers) may leave the GMCVP to take up&#13;
positions elsewhere. The n'sk is mitigated through on-the-job training, improved&#13;
work environment, frequent supervision and support from TA, and the&#13;
implementation of high-profile activities. This will motivate staff;&#13;
(d)    That the local research community and the policymakers do not use the facilities&#13;
offered by the GMCVP. The risk is minimized by GMCVPs integration in the&#13;
permanent structure of [NE, by the high profile it currently enjoys, by continued&#13;
advertising, and by dissemination of its outputs.&#13;
(e)    That the policy context in Angola becomes too unstable to allow incorporation of&#13;
information and recommendations acquired by the GMCVP into processes of&#13;
planning and policy formulation. However any data collected would still be&#13;
useful once the situation stabilizes again and the country's capacity to measure the&#13;
population's living conditions would be stronger.&#13;
&#13;

5. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
A. Conditions&#13;
5.1    The recommendations and conditions for preparation and approval of the project follow:&#13;
5.2    As a condition of effectiveness of the IDA Credit, a Subsidiary Grant Agreement between&#13;
Government and the FAS acceptable to IDA for the use of the proceeds of the IDA Credit be&#13;
executed (para 2.10).&#13;
5.3    As conditions of disbursement of the IDA Credit proceeds for the Poverty Monitoring&#13;
component: (a) 1NE will have adopted a manual of procedures for the GMCVP satisfactory to&#13;
IDA; (b) INE will have appointed an administrator, to administer the GMCVP funds, with&#13;
qualifications, skills and experience and on terms of reference satisfactory to IDA; (c) IDA will&#13;
have received a satisfactory legal opinion that the ministerial decree modifying INE Statutes has&#13;
been approved; and, (d) the Government will have established an account in local currency with an&#13;
initial deposit of US$5,000 equivalent in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA, for counterpart&#13;
funding of the project expenditures for the GMCVP (paras 2.47, 2.69 &amp; 3.25).&#13;
B. Agreements&#13;
5.4    To ensure smooth implementation of the project, at negotiations Government agreed to:&#13;
(a) grant the proceeds of the IDA Credit to the FAS through a Subsidiary Grant&#13;
Agreement satisfactory to IDA (para 2.10);&#13;
(b) require the FAS to have professional staff at national and provincial levels, with&#13;
qualifications and experience, and on terms and conditions of employment acceptable&#13;
to IDA throughout project implementation (para 2.25);&#13;
(c) ensure that the Procedures and Administrative Manuals of the FAS, including the&#13;
strategy for expansion of activities to additional provinces are at all times satisfactory&#13;
to IDA, and that these will not be modified without IDA's prior agreement (paras&#13;
2.13&amp; 2.29);&#13;
(d) require the GMCVP to carry out studies and surveys in accordance with terms of&#13;
reference and timetables acceptable to IDA, and further require that the findings be&#13;
discussed with IDA. When appropriate, the Borrower will prepare action plans to&#13;
address the issues which emerge from these studies and surveys (para 2.47);&#13;
(e) staff the GMCVP with persons with qualifications, terms of reference, and in numbers&#13;
acceptable to IDA throughout project implementation (para 2.63);&#13;
(f) carry out through the GMCVP, and require the FAS to carry out, semi-annual reviews&#13;
that will include (i) a record of Government's comrmitment to operate and maintain&#13;
public facilities rehabilitated under the Project in a manner acceptable to IDA and (ii)&#13;
a yearly work program for GMCVP (paras 2.81, &amp; 2.85);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
(g) carry out a midterm review of the project not less than 24 months and not more than&#13;
30 months after the project becomes effective, or when 50 percent of funds have been&#13;
disbursed, whichever comes first, after which the Government will present a plan&#13;
acceptable to IDA for the further implementation of the project (paras 2.82 &amp; 2.87);&#13;
(h) ensure the timely provision of adequate Government counterpart funding (para 2.67);&#13;
(i) grant public access to all information from surveys and studies funded by the proceeds&#13;
of the Credit (para 2.75);&#13;
(j) carry out, and require the FAS to carry out, all procurement using standard bidding&#13;
and contract documents for the project and according to the arrangements laid out in&#13;
para 3.6 to 3.17;&#13;
(k) present to [DA audit reports for the project, as soon as possible after the end of the&#13;
Angolan financial year, but no later than six months after its completion. These audits&#13;
will report on the Project Account with a separate opinion on the use of the Special&#13;
Accounts and the statements of expenditures (SOEs). A management letter will be&#13;
part of the audits. The audits will be carried out by an independent auditing firm&#13;
(already appointed), with proper qualifications and under terms of reference acceptable&#13;
to IDA (para 3.27); and&#13;
(I) ensure that all applications to withdraw proceeds from the Credit are fully&#13;
documented, except for expenditures for training, workshops, recurrent costs, and for&#13;
contracts with a value of US$100,000 or less for goods and civil works and for&#13;
consultant services under US$50,000 for firms and US$20,000 for individuals for&#13;
which reimbursements are made against SOEs (para 3.19).&#13;
C. Recommendation&#13;
5.5    On the basis of the above actions, conditions and agreements, the proposed project is&#13;
suitable for an IDA Credit of US$24 million equivalent.&#13;

FAS Expansion Strategy Document&#13;
1. INTRODUCAO&#13;
0 FUNDO DE APOIO SOCIAL - FAS, foi criado com um caracter temporal, como uma agencia&#13;
governamental aut6noma, dotada de personalid..de juridica e gozando de autonomia financeira e&#13;
administrativa, com meios e procedimentos pr6prios, que Ihe permitam actuar com celeridade, eficiencia e&#13;
eficacia, sendo dotada, igualmente, de meios de controlo, simnples e transparentes, da uti]izagao dos recursos&#13;
colocados sob sua gestao, por forma a promover o alivio social e o combate A pobreza, viabilizando a&#13;
incorporagao da populagIo mais pobre no processo de reconstruqao e de desenvolvimento econ6mico e&#13;
social do Pais.&#13;
No acto da sua criaqao, foi-lhe atribuido um caracter nacional, o que significa dizer que o FAS devera&#13;
estender a sua acgao a todas as areas que revelem real necessidade e aos sectores s6cio-econ6micos que&#13;
contribuam para melhorar as condiSoes de vida das respectivas populaSoes. Para assegurar c alcance deste&#13;
pressuposto, foi concebida uma estrutura de gestao descentralizada, com dois niveis de decisao: um nacional&#13;
e outro provincial, com distin9ao nitida de funSoes entre a UNrDADE DE COORDEN;A(O - concepqao e&#13;
criagao de condit6es adequadas A implementagao, como a mobilizagao dos parceiros sociais nacionais e&#13;
intermacionais, a promogao, divulgacao e irnagem do Fundo, bem como a representaSao do FAS -, enquanto&#13;
que as Representaqdes Provinciais intervem, fundamentaLmente como a-,ncias locais de financiamento de&#13;
projectos comunitarios.&#13;
A adopAao deste principio de descentraliza,co na gestao do FAS, perinite criar o espago necessario a&#13;
adequagao dos objectivos gerais do Fundo a especificidade social, econ6mica, cultural e ecol6gica de cada&#13;
regiao, o que   aumentara a receptividade das populaqoes e dos parceiros sociais locais, uma vez que e&#13;
possivel ter em devida conta as suas particularidades. Por outro lado, pernmite optar por uma esrrutura flexivel&#13;
e pequena, crescendo e diversificando as suas capacidades tecnicas em funglo das necessidades que se forern&#13;
apresentando, quer localmente quer a nivel global.&#13;
Em resultado da crise econ6mica e social que Aneola atravessa, devida nAo s6 A longa duraAo da guerra e&#13;
aos efeitos da ma gestao dos recursos de que o Pais disp6e, o que se traduz num aumento vertiginoso do&#13;
numero de habitantes em situagao de pobreza e na delapidagao dos recursos financeiros e naturais, instalou-se&#13;
um clima de profunda desconfianga da populagao relativamente as iniciativas do Governo e, principalmente,&#13;
as intervenq6es de outros mecanismos financeiros, no geral muito pouco sucedidos; Numa primeira fase e ate&#13;
que o FAS tivesse a aoportunidade de evidenciar mecanismos e procedimentos claros e transparentes, o&#13;
sentimento generalizado de desconfian9a e reserva poderia ter impactos negativos na aceitaqao deste pela&#13;
populagAo.&#13;
Assim, procurou-se que nos procedimentos e mecanismos de implementaiao do Fundo estivessem bem&#13;
definidos os espagos e os objectivos e as regras da participavao dos distintos actores sociais, a adopgao de&#13;
metodos participativos na tomada de decisoes, os mecanismos de co-responsabilidade na execugao das&#13;
acqoes, a sub-contraraSio de servi9os especializados e a realizagao de auditorias semestrais.&#13;
Finalmente, o FAS e criado no limiar de mais um periodo de transiqao da guerra para a paz e num quadro de&#13;
preparagao e implementagao de um programa de estabilizaqao econ6mica, o que implica a clara defini$ao da&#13;
sua area de intervengao e o estabelecimento de complementaridades e sinergias com outras iniciativas do&#13;
govemo, nomeadamente com os programas de Mesa Redonda, de Microrealizaq6es, de Desenvolvimento&#13;
Comunitario, por um lado; e imprescindivel, tambem, o estabelecimento de relagoes de dialogo e&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43 -                                 Annex C&#13;
enquadramento com os programas de Investimentos Publicos, de apoio as Mulheres e As Crianqas, etc. Neste&#13;
sentido, tem vindo a ser preparados Protocolos de Coopera%Ao entre o Fas e as Direcc6es ou Coordenaqoes de&#13;
tais programas, os quais visam ordenar a intervenSao de cada instituicAo, visando maximizar efeitos,&#13;
eliminando duplicaAao de esfor9os e reduzindo os esforcos humnanos, materiais e financeiros para o apoio ao&#13;
reforgo das capacidades institucionais.&#13;
Assumiu-se, portanto, que apenas numa 6ptica de 'investimento humano' e equacionando devidamente os&#13;
factores: consciencializagao da sociedade civil, qualidade dos agentes instirucionais envolvidos e efectiva&#13;
articulagao das politicas, projectos e ac-oes, seria possivel alcangar resultados positivos. Dai, a criaAao do&#13;
FAS como um mecanismo Agil, flexivel, eficiente e transparente, capaz de se tomar num canal previlegiado&#13;
de mobilizaiao e alocagao de recursos, internos e externos.&#13;
2. A FASE EXPERIMENTAL DO FAS&#13;
No periodo compreendido entre JuUho e Agosto de 1994, ap6s a selec;Ao da provincia do Kwanza-Sul como&#13;
Area piloto, trabalhou-se na concepgao dos documentos legais de criagao e regulamentaqao do Fundo,&#13;
decorrendo de Aaosto a Dezembro um periodo de analise e aperfei$oamento dos mesmos, os quais foram&#13;
aprovados pelo Comitd de Coordenagao nacional em 27 de Dezembro de 1994. Contudo, e porque se&#13;
mnostraram  absolutamente necessArias, foram introduzidas algumas alterag6es de formna e de conteudo nesses&#13;
documentos, nomeadamente a separagao em dois - de gestao e de procedimrentos - do entao Manual de&#13;
Procedimentos; a preparagao de um Manual de Desembolsos. Considera-se ser necessario melhorar o&#13;
tratamento dado as questoes de 'Procurement?', pelo que esta area, tera tambem um Manual individualizado.&#13;
Entretanto, e ap6s ter-se iniciado a fase experimental no Kwanza Sul, concluiu-se que scria vantajoso testar os&#13;
mecanismos e procedimentos concebidos para o FAS, noutros contextos s6cio-econ6micos, o que conduziu A&#13;
abertura de mais tres representaqoes provinciais do FAS - Benguela, Namibe e Cabinda - todas na faixa litoral&#13;
por ser a regiao onde, apesar da guerra, se conseguiu manter um minimo de estabelidade e normalidade em&#13;
Areas significativas dos seus territ6rios. numa segunda fase, havia iniciado o trabalho de sensibilizaiao e&#13;
selecgao das equipas na Huila e no Kunene -ja na regiao planaltica e sub-planaltica do interior sul de Angola,&#13;
trabalho este que foi interrompido devido As conclus6es da Missao de Avaliaqao de Fevereiro de 1995.&#13;
A escolha destas provincias para o arranque do FAS nao resultou de um acaso nem de simpatia, embora nao&#13;
existam dados estatisticos que pudessem de uma forma clara e objectiva apontar para a sua selecgao.&#13;
Considerando que a situagIo de pobreza e generalizada, nAo s6 em termos de territ6rio mas tambem em&#13;
terrnos de grupos-alvo, os critdrios a utilizar para esta selecAao incial e para a previsao de crescimento do&#13;
FAS, teriam necessariamente de assentar na exist8ncia de um minimo de normalidade no funcionamento das&#13;
instituiqoes do Estado, do tecido empresarial, de um sector nao-governamental a afirmar-se e com condigoes&#13;
de seguranga e de circulagao minimas para se deslocar e trabalhar com as comunidades e, por conseguinte,&#13;
onde a partida e maior a receptividade dos potenciais beneficiarios a este tipo de iniciativas.&#13;
A falta de indicadores sociais para melhor quantificar e caracterizar os potenciais beneficiarios e melhor&#13;
perspectivar o tipo de interven;oes a realizar, levaram a realizar este trabalho de escolha do caminho a seguir&#13;
pelo Fas nos primeiros tempos da sua existencia, muito na base do conhecimnento e experiencia que a equipa&#13;
executiva e de colaboradores e amigos do FAS, reforqada pelos trabalhos de caracterizagao desenvolvidos&#13;
quando da realiza;ao dos 'workshops provinciais', nas reunioes dos comites, nos contactos com autoridades&#13;
locais, em reunioes com agencias governamentais e nao-governamentais, nacionais e internacionais, etc. com&#13;
as quais se tem trocado opini6es sobre a estrategia de cresciimento que a direcgIo executiva do Fas term vindo&#13;
a preparar.&#13;

3. AS FASES SEGUlNTES DO FAS&#13;
Assim, utilizando os indicadores de gestAo e de 'performance' anteriorrnente estabelecidos para as equipas do&#13;
FAS e aplicando os conhecimentos da situa9ao do pais e da sua evoluqao, conceberam-se os seguintes&#13;
quadros resumo de alargamento das representaq6es do FAS para os 4 anos iniciais do FAS, tratando com&#13;
maior pormenor os primeiros 3 a 4 semestres, deixando sempre em aberto a possibilidade de actualizar tal&#13;
previsAo com a introdu9Ao de dados novos, no inicio de cada semestre, durante o qual devera ser executada a&#13;
estrategia de crescimento para o semestre seguinte. Isto, per-mite, por exemplo, que os resultados dos&#13;
inqueritos actualemente em curso possam ser utilizados A medida que foram sendo disponibilizados.&#13;
Estao a ser preparados 'perfis s6cio-econ6micos' das provincias onde jA existem representacocs do FAS e&#13;
naquelas onde se espera chegar ate ao fim do 1P semestre, ou sejam, Huila, Kunene e Luanda(s).&#13;
Esta tiltima, devido A elevada densidade demografica, sera tratada nao como uma unidade mas sim como um&#13;
conjunto de tres unidades aut6nomas umas das outras, resultantes do agrupamento de 2 a 3 municipios&#13;
vizinhos e dando prioridade as regides peri-urbanas, a saber:&#13;
V Viana, Kilamba Kiaxi e Rangel&#13;
* Kakuaku, Sambizanga e Cazenga&#13;
* Samba, Ingombotas e Maianga,&#13;
o que pode ser melhor compreendido pela consulta do mapa em anexo.&#13;
Durante o 1° semestre de implementago do FAS devera ser preparada e discutida a estrategia a implementar&#13;
no periodo seguinte, seja do ponto de vista da cobertura geografica, seja do ponto de vista das 'alianqas' e&#13;
parcerias a estabelecer. Esta estrategia deve ser aprovada pela Reuniao de Directores do FAS (com carActer&#13;
semestral), depois de submetida A analise dos Comitds Provinciais e Nacional.&#13;
Importa referir que, para aldm dos criterios atras referidos, a abertura de novos escrit6rios provinciais do FAS&#13;
estA condicionada A avaliacao positiva do desempenho do Fundo Ia onde ja estA instalado e, de uma mane ira&#13;
geral, ao alcance dos objectivos globalmente definidos, pelo que a responsabilizacAo e o empenho colectivos&#13;
sao condic6es essenciais para o bom sucesso desta iniciativa e pelo alargamento das suas perspectivas e&#13;
capacidades de intervenSao.&#13;
A dinamica de execucao do Fundo de Apoio Social (FAS) nos uItimos meses da Fase Exeprimental e&#13;
prenuncio de um nivel de desembolsos bastante superior ao programado, o que significa dizer que se preve&#13;
que os valores programados para desembolsos ao longo de quatro (4) anos, poderao ser engajados num&#13;
periodo de tempo bem mais reduzido. Assim, decidiu-se realizar uma paragem para reflexlo na expansao do&#13;
FAS, no 4° semestre, e programar para esta altura o 'mid term review'.&#13;
0 objectivo c perrmitir uma profunda avaliacao dos resultados e da performance obtida atd ai pelo FAS e a sua&#13;
plena incorporacao na reprogramatao dos 4 semestres seguintes, a partir de uma definiqIo estratdgica de&#13;
base: estudar a possibilidade de comeqar a trabalhar com Unidades Regionais (em lugar das provinciais),&#13;
agrupando provincias com menor densidade populacional e menor capacidade de absorrao, a partir de&#13;
factores s6cio-econ6micos e culturais afins ou outros factores como meios de comunica.1o, por exemplo.&#13;

Notes: HEIS, IPCVP n and CS are acronyms for the national surveys. Compliance with planned schedule will be&#13;
the measure of performance. 1: HEIS (Expenditure and Income Survey). 2: IPCVD II (Second Priority Survey on&#13;
Living Conditions) 3: CS (Community Survey). For these the project timetables provide these indicators. In&#13;
assessing the quality and efficiency of the work, the following documents will be found useful.&#13;
For survey preparation: i)sampling design and sampling execution report; ii) questionnaire and instructions manual&#13;
for interviewer and supervisor; iii) data entry program and instructions; iv) manual for data entry clerks; and, v)&#13;
report of the pilot survey&#13;
For survey implementation: 1) timing of the operations in accordance with the project timetable; ii) survey&#13;
implementation report; iii) quality assessment report of the survey results; and, iv) main report of the survey result.&#13;
For the Study Program, progress at the technical level will be measured through the clearances and quality&#13;
assessments of the studies by the Bank.&#13;
In the following pages a more comprehensive list of indicators linking input, output and outcome (impact) of the&#13;
project to its objectives is shown For FAS the information needed for these indicators will be provided by the MIS&#13;
system and the results of planned annual surveys and audits. For the Poverty Monitoring component, it will include&#13;
data on the Government's budget and analysis off Govemment policies and strategies. The use of this list for the&#13;
midterm review will be discussed with the teams and Government.&#13;

(Draft) Terms of Reference Beneficiary Assessment FAS&#13;
L BACKGROUND&#13;
0 Governo de Angola criou, atraves do Decreto n° 44/94 de 28 de Outubro de 1994. o FUNDO DE APOIO&#13;
SOCIAL - FAS, com o co-financiamento do Banco Mundial. 0 FAS, componente do Projecto de Accao&#13;
Social (PAS), constitui-se conio uma agencia de financiamento dotada de autonomia j]uridica,&#13;
administrativa e financeira, visando a mobiliza,do de recursos - internos e externos - destinados a&#13;
financiarem projectos identificados e priorizados pelas comunidades e por elas executados, com ou sem o&#13;
apoio de Agencias de Enquadramento'. como ONG's. Instituiqoes Religiosas, Associac6es, Pequenas&#13;
Empresas, etc.&#13;
Ha dois componentes fundamentais na abordagem do FAS que importa ressaltar; sao eles: (a) a lideran,ca,&#13;
pela comunidade. do processo de identificaqco. preparaSao e implementacao dos projectos. que irao&#13;
responder as suas necessidades mais prioritarias. Reforcar a capacidade de intervenqao das comunidades a&#13;
comeiando pelo esforco organizativo necessario para conduzir todo este processo e pelo assumir da&#13;
propriedade dos projectos, sao principios essenciais do FAS. (b) Mecanismos de desembolso expeditos, por&#13;
forma a assegurar que os pedidos das comunidades s3o respondidos de uma forma oportuna. Por forma a&#13;
permitir ao FAS ser eficiente e efectivo, ele sera conduzido por uma estrutura de gestdo aut6noma,&#13;
descentralizada, com dois niveis de decisdo, com representa,ces provinciais para facilitar a implementacao&#13;
e a monitorizaqao dos sub-projectos. 0 Fundo desenvolvera, portanto, procedimentos de desembolso e de&#13;
aquisig6es bastante flexiveis. apropriados a sua implementag5o ao nivel local.&#13;
Uma vez que a participacao comunitaria constitui um principio de destaque, o projecto ira tentar ter em&#13;
devida conta os pontos de vista dos potenciais beneficiarios ao nivel das comunidades, no desenho da&#13;
constituiqao do Fundo e na monitorizacao da implementaqao do FAS, atravds de una serie de 'consultas&#13;
sistematicas aos beneficiarios/clientes'. Pretende-se que este  exercicio  de 'consultas sistematicas'&#13;
constitua o primeiro passo nesta serie de consultas locais, desenhadas para preencher algunas fathas de&#13;
informag6es necessirias a preparacao do projecto. Pretende-se, ainda, que este exercicio constitua a&#13;
primeira fase nos componenets parcitipativos de um Fundo Social, conduzindo e orientando o desenho de&#13;
um sistema de monitorizacao participativa (avaliacao pelos beneficiarios), por um lado, e aos componentes&#13;
participativos do projecto, pelo outro.&#13;
H. OBJECTIVOS DAS CONSULTAS SISTEMATICAS AOS BENEFICIARIOS/CL[ENTES&#13;
Usando uma mistura de metodos quantitativos e qualitativos, este exercicio de consultas sistematicas&#13;
pretende solicitar uam visao cruzada de caracter s6cio-econ6mico de potenciais beneficiarios ao nivel das&#13;
comunidades, preenchendo falhas em informac6es - chave para a implementacao do projecto, do ponto de&#13;
vista da comunidade. Estima-se que o trabalho de campo ocupe um periodo de cerca de 3 semanas,&#13;
cobrindo cerca de 16 comunidades (urbans e rurais). As tres areas-chave identificadas pela equipa que&#13;
preparou este projecto serao descritas seguidamente e constituem a base das quest6es contidas no Guia&#13;

Annual Financial, Technical and lmpact Evaluations&#13;
Background&#13;
The use of participatory and qualitative research methods and rapid rural or urban appraisals is&#13;
becoming increasingly common. Many donors, NGOs and Government ministries are now using&#13;
participatory and qualitative research techniques to ensure that project interventions are more&#13;
closely attuned to the needs and preferences of the poor. Beneficiary Assessments are used in this&#13;
project to monitor and evaluate FAS sub-project activities from the perspective of the beneficiaries.&#13;
Assessments will be carried out at regular intervals from 1995 onwards and results will be fed into&#13;
the improvement of FAS procedures and systems. Material from the Beneficiary Assessments&#13;
may be used by other donor agencies and NGOs.&#13;
Using Beneficiary Assessments has shown that participatory research methods provide a highly&#13;
valuable complement to more conventional forms of program monitoring and poverty analysis and&#13;
contribute to community empowerment in the context of sub-project management. For an&#13;
overview, see Table 1.&#13;

Technical reviews will be used to assess the quality of the sub-projects. An important part of these&#13;
reviews will be assessment of the sustainability of sub-projects. Government's contribution is to be&#13;
reviewed, including the financial contribution and assurances of physical and human resources.&#13;
The first of these reviews is planned for August 1996.&#13;
Financial audits will include tests of the accounting records, verification of assets and liabilities, a&#13;
Statement of Expenditures, a management letter, and other auditing procedures considered&#13;
necessary.&#13;

Training Program&#13;
FAS&#13;
Procurement and Disbursement&#13;
Every six months, the FAS will organize a six-day workshop on procurement and disbursement&#13;
practices. The session will be attended by FAS staff, specially those from newly-opened offices,&#13;
and representatives of community groups, local authorities and NGOs cooperating with FAS. The&#13;
aim will be to make people familiar with these procedures, hear their experiences and discuss&#13;
problems encountered during implementation. Methodology: Theory and practice, using examples&#13;
of day-to-day work.&#13;
The FAS staff will attend intemational workshops and seminars to learn experience with social&#13;
action funds from other countries and to present the FAS work. One trip a year for two persons&#13;
has been budgeted.&#13;
Poverty Monitoring&#13;
The objective of the training program is to improve the skills of GMCVP and INE staff trough: on-&#13;
the-job training, study trips, seminars, workshops, fellowship and direct technical assistance.&#13;
Training areas include: fieldwork (data collection and processing), computer programming, survey&#13;
design and organization, data analysis, economics and management. At the end of the program, the&#13;
staff will have acquired skills that will: (i) improve the capacity of the Institute and the Government&#13;
as a whole; and (ii) assist the development of a local critical mass of researchers and specialists&#13;
able to animate a national poverty monitoring system. Candidates for training will have to be&#13;
directly involved in project implementation.&#13;
Survey Implementation&#13;
Workshops will be held before each survey. The workshops will be targeted to:&#13;
(a) Enumerators or field and data entry staff. The workshop will familiarize them with&#13;
interview techniques, questionnaires, objectives contents and, concepts and definitions&#13;
used in the survey. Duration: two to three weeks. Methodology: includes group class&#13;
sessions with exercises, interview games and field sessions as direct practice exercises.&#13;
After training interviewers will be selected, on the basis of regular tests and the&#13;
trainers' appreciation of their personality and capacity.&#13;
(b) Data Entry Clerks: data entry staff. The training will consist of a short version of&#13;
training for the enumerators in addition to a program used for data entry and intensive&#13;
practice so that data entry staff will acquire the necessary speed. Duration: two&#13;
weeks. Methodology: classroom and computer laboratory sessions. After training,&#13;
data entry clients will be selected according to their capacity to deliver timely and&#13;
correct work.&#13;
(c) Supervisors: the candidates will need previous survey experience or high level of&#13;
education (usually a Master's degree). They will follow training sessions for&#13;

work, management of the teams, supervision of interviews and verification of&#13;
questionnaires. Duration: three weeks. Methodology: theoretical sessions and practice&#13;
of supervision during the field exercises for the enumerators and verification of the&#13;
outputs of the data entry clerks' exercises.&#13;
Survey design and organization.&#13;
Survey design and implementation: candidates (one or two per year) will attend the Abidjan&#13;
training session organized by the World Bank and the Munich Training Center. During the project,&#13;
the staff will visit countries where poverty-related surveys are implemented to expose the staff to&#13;
problems encountered, new methods used and adaptations to specific issues. Two trips of 20 days&#13;
duration have been budgeted.&#13;
Qu:-litative techniques: organized for surveys such as beneficiary and participatory assessments.&#13;
Methodology: direct TA, on-the-job training related to the study program delivered by experienced&#13;
international consultants.&#13;
Sampling techniques: on-the-job training will be organized either as a study trip or at a local&#13;
workshop. The study trip will be organized with a foreign statistical office to complete the training&#13;
of two persons in sampling techniques and by exposing them to the sampling design and execution&#13;
of surveys already implemented. Any locally-held workshop will cover the same content, using the&#13;
same or equivalent training methodology.&#13;
Data Analysis&#13;
Data analysis and processing: one study trip will be organized with SIIPCO, the US Census&#13;
Bureau for IMPS (6 weeks). The objective is to improve and adapt the skills of one staff member&#13;
to the processing and analysis of the poverty surveys. On-the-job training will be given,&#13;
throughout the implementation of the survey program, with direct support provided to GMCVP&#13;
for programming data entry and consistency checks and tabulation.&#13;
Poverty data analysis and modeling: on-the-job training through direct TA. Targeted to all&#13;
technical people working in survey design and implementation. This training will focus on macro&#13;
modeling for the development of generalized equilibrium models and a social accounting matrix;&#13;
poverty analysis from quantitative and qualitative surveys; weighting for price index; gender&#13;
analysis; incomes and expenditure data preparation; classifying households, socioeconomic and&#13;
target groups; employment and labor market; and the informal sector. Seminars and workshops on&#13;
specific topics will be organized as necessary.&#13;

Nature of Benefits: The main benefit will be increased accessibility to health facilities, schools,&#13;
and water in rural and peri-urban areas. Those areas have on average lower incomes than the&#13;
centers of the towns, and much lower access to basic services. The main beneficiaries of these&#13;
services are women and children. Other benefits include increased knowledge of the living&#13;
conditions of the poor in Angola, improved targeting of poverty reduction activities and better&#13;
measurement of the impact of these interventions. During the pilot phase, the average total&#13;
investment costs per direct beneficiary has been US$5.54.  The rehabilitated structures are&#13;
calculated to last about 10 years with basic maintenance and without major repairs. During the&#13;
pilot phase, sub-project incremental recurrent costs averaged US$0.28 per year per direct&#13;
beneficiary. That figure represents around 1/900 of the GNP per capita. These figures consider&#13;
only direct beneficiaries, not the whole community. Even in the difficult situation of Angolan&#13;
communities, this seems affordable.&#13;
These numbers are early estimates from the current Education Project. Implementation experience indicates&#13;
that the actual costs will probably be lower.&#13;

            Angola - Social Action Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Social Action Project aims to assist
            Angola in its transition from war to peace, targeting in
            particular the people impoverished by the military and
            economic crises. The objectives of the project are to: 1)
            improve access to basic services through the provision or
            rehabilitation of community infrastructure; 2) improve the
            capacity of communities and nongovernmental organizations
            (NGOs) to plan, appraise, manage and maintain investment
            activities, through experience gained in the project; 3)
            generate additional income and employment in rural and urban
            areas through revenue-generating sub-projects; 4) enhance
            the capacity of Angolan institutions to collect and analyze
            poverty-related data; and 5) provide a better understanding
            of the main causes of poverty in order to help formulate
            effective poverty alleviation strategies and generate
            adequate policies for socioeconomic development. The project
            consists of the following two components: 1) a social action
            fund component which will finance sub-projects identified,
            prepared and implemented by local communities; and 2) a
            poverty monitoring component which will finance
            policy-relevant research on poverty and social issues, and
            systematic poverty monitoring through household surveys.
