This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Arrangements&#13;
between the Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
1.    Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1   The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in&#13;
this Administration Arrangement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to&#13;
the Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a&#13;
fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this&#13;
Administration Arrangement shall be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the&#13;
Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from&#13;
time to time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard&#13;
policies, its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to&#13;
prevent the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to&#13;
give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of&#13;
Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any&#13;
obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules&#13;
and executive orders of an individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.    Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1   The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall&#13;
be kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may&#13;
be commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as&#13;
trustee, has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2   The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars&#13;
(the "Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their&#13;
respective Administration Arrangements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution&#13;
Currency other than the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the&#13;
accompanying Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency&#13;
at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to&#13;
be insufficient to complete activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor&#13;
the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4   The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other&#13;
currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the&#13;
date of the conversion.&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿2.5   The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment&#13;
of trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to&#13;
the Trust Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.    Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1   The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each Installment,&#13;
an amount equal to two percent (2%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2   In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for Trust Fund&#13;
administration, that are: (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above as an&#13;
administrative fee; and (ii) not included under Annex 1 of the Administration Arrangements in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures shall be charged to the Trust Fund&#13;
on an actual basis up to a maximum of four point seventy-seven percent (4.77%) of the total&#13;
Contributions under all Administration Arrangements.&#13;
3.3.  Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust&#13;
Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual&#13;
Contributions significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of&#13;
the first Administration Arrangement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs&#13;
change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and&#13;
Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration&#13;
Arrangements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that&#13;
are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration Arrangements or from&#13;
new Donors under new Administration Arrangements.&#13;
4.    Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
4.1   The Bank shall maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;
4.2   The Bank shall furnish to the Donors current financial information relating to receipts,&#13;
disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions via the&#13;
World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website. Within six (6) months after all&#13;
commitments and liabilities under the Trust Fund have been satisfied and the Trust Fund has been&#13;
closed, the final financial information relating to receipts, disbursements and fund balance in the&#13;
Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions shall be made available to the Donors via the&#13;
World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website.&#13;
4.3   The Bank shall provide to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Fund Donor Center secure&#13;
website, within six (6) months following the end of each Bank fiscal year, an annual single audit&#13;
report, comprising (i) a management assertion together with an attestation from the Bank's external&#13;
auditors concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all&#13;
cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿funds together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall&#13;
be borne by the Bank.&#13;
4.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether&#13;
such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope&#13;
and terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the&#13;
Bank shall arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs&#13;
of the Bank with respect to such audit, shall be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;
4.5   The Bank shall make available to the Donors copies of all financial statements and auditors'&#13;
reports received by the Bank from Recipients pursuant to any Grant Agreements (as defined below)&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's Access to Information Policy.&#13;

financed by the Contributions. Within six (6) months of the End Disbursement Date (as defined&#13;
below), the Bank shall furnish to the Donors a final report on the activities financed by the Trust&#13;
Fund.&#13;
5.2    Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund at any time up to&#13;
six (6) months following the End Disbursement Date. The Donor and the Bank shall agree on the&#13;
scope and conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all relevant information&#13;
within the limits of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including&#13;
any costs incurred by the Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review&#13;
or evaluation will not constitute a financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.    Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank&#13;
by&#13;
June 30, 2018 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank shall only disburse funds deposited in the&#13;
Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration Arrangement (other than returns to Donors) after&#13;
such date to the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to the&#13;
Administration Arrangements of all the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank&#13;
shall return any remaining balance of the Trust Fund to each Donor in the Holding Currency in the&#13;
manner specified in its respective Administration Arrangement on a pro rata basis with regard to the&#13;
total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by such Donor relative to the total funds deposited in the&#13;
Trust Fund by all Donors, all calculated as Holding Currency amounts.&#13;
6.2    Any Donor may cancel all or part of such Donor's pro rata share, and the Bank may cancel&#13;
all or any Donors' pro rata shares, upon three (3) months' prior written notice, of any Contributions&#13;
(paid and not yet paid) that are not committed pursuant to any agreements entered into between the&#13;
Bank and any consultants and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration&#13;
Arrangement, including any Grant Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a&#13;
cancellation, the Bank shall return to the relevant Donor or Donors in the Holding Currency in the&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿manner specified by each such Donor in its respective Administration Arrangement the pro rata&#13;
share(s) of any such uncommitted balance of the Trust Fund, in accordance with any additional&#13;
terms that may be agreed between the Bank and each such Donor.&#13;
7.    Disclosure: Dispute Resolution&#13;
7.1   The Bank shall disclose the Administration Arrangements and related information on this&#13;
