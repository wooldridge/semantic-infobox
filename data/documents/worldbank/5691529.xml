                   PROGRAMPERFORMANCE OVERALL&#13;
&#13;
 1.      MacroeconomicFramework. Marketconfidence returnedwith the arrival o f&#13;
 President Fernandez in August 2004 and the commitment o f his administration to&#13;
 stabilize the economy and restore growth.      The new administration immediately&#13;
 initiatednegotiations with the IMF for a new Stand-By Agreement (SBA) including a&#13;
 macro stabilization program with revenue and expenditure measures to reduce the&#13;
 fiscal gap, commitments on improved debt accrual and management process, and a&#13;
 range of banking measures to retumthe sector to sound footing. As a first step, a tax&#13;
 reform package was prepared inconsultation with the IMF andpassedby Congress in&#13;
 October 2004; this i s expected to generate additional revenues equal to 1.7 percent o f&#13;
 GDP in 2005. Since July 2004, the peso has appreciated from RD$45/US$ to less&#13;
than RD$30/US$ in November 2004 and has since then remained stable between&#13;
RD$28 andRD$32 to the US$. Inflationhas come down significantly and spreads on&#13;
 external bonds have also fallen inrecent months. InApril 2004 the Paris Club agreed&#13;
to reschedule US$193 million in 2004 debt obligations, pending an agreement o f&#13;
comparable treatment by private creditors. In October 2004 the authorities hired&#13;
investment bank advisors to pursue a market-friendlyrestructuringo fprivate debt. In&#13;
addition, the Central Bank has managed to stabilize base money. Regular auctions&#13;
have been significantly or fully subscribed, and interest rates on Central Bank&#13;
certificates have come down significantly in the last two months, with longer&#13;
maturities. Loan and deposit interest rates at commercialbankshave also fallen since&#13;
July 2004. All these measures culminated with the approval by the Board of the&#13;
IMFoftheSBA onJanuary31,2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.       Looking ahead, the Dominican economy will face new and large competitive&#13;
pressures in the framework o f imminent trade policy changes that will make&#13;
achieving and maintaining the high growth rates o f the 1990s more challenging.&#13;
Increased trade liberalization i s expected in the form o f the phase-out of the Multi&#13;
FibreAgreement in2005 (which will meanincreased competition on apparel exports,&#13;
especially from China), the new free trade agreement with the U S (DR-CAFTA) and&#13;
the forthcoming WTO requirement to adjust the Free Trade Zone (FTZ) tax regime to&#13;
eliminate effective export subsidies by 2010. The Multi Fibre Agreement phase-out&#13;
may result in a major contraction inFTZ apparel exports, although the DR-CAFTA is&#13;
expected to cushion the impact by stimulating trade, investment and employment.&#13;
The fiscal impact o f DR-CAFTA may be particularly challenging, however, with&#13;
fiscal revenues potentially falling by as much as 40 percent. But, provided the&#13;
Dominican authorities respond with adequate policies and reform, the pay-off to&#13;
increased trade liberalization will be higher growth.        Greater competition for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Dominicanproducers will spur them to take advantage o f the opportunities associated&#13;
withtrade opening.&#13;
&#13;
 3.      Inthe case of the agriculture sector, the impact of trade liberalization under&#13;
DR-CAFTA will be mainly on the fiscal side: fiscal revenues on agriculture imports&#13;
 are expected to decline by the equivalent o f 5 percent o f total current agriculture tariff&#13;
revenue in the short run, reaching 12 percent in 15 years. DR-CAFTA will most&#13;
 likelyhave limited short-term impact on agricultural trade volumes andprices, given&#13;
that Dominican agriculture exports already have preferentialaccess to the US. Onthe&#13;
import side, most prices already reflect foreign competition, except for protected&#13;
products that will continue to be protected for another 15 to 20 years.               Price&#13;
distortions created by highimport tariffs to selected crops, such as rice, will decrease&#13;
in the medium and long term, although they will not disappear. However, in the&#13;
medium term, the new incentive structure will likely induce a shift from rice&#13;
cultivation to higher value-added products, such as tropical fruits.&#13;
&#13;
Poverty Trends and Social Issues&#13;
&#13;
4.       The country's impressive economic growth during the 1990s (5.9 percent on&#13;
average) resulted in a reduction o f poverty from 34 percent in 1992 to 29 percent in&#13;
 1998 (from 7 to 5 percent for extreme poverty). Economic growth had been the&#13;
overarching force behind poverty reduction while persistent disparities in the&#13;
distribution o f human, physical and financial assets and inefficiency and inequity in&#13;
public spendingprevented a faster decline inpoverty. Inparticular, large segments o f&#13;
the rural populationhave not participated inthe benefits of growth. Povertyrates are&#13;
also higher among households headed by females and elderly people, and take their&#13;
heaviest toll on children and youth through increased rates o f malnutrition, school&#13;
dropouts, youth unemployment and riskybehavior such as violence, drugs, crime and&#13;
riskysexual activity. Entrenched pockets ofpovertypersist onthe Haitianborder and&#13;
inthe bateyes, the old sugarplantations. This indicates that while economic growthis&#13;
critical to reduce poverty inthe Dominican Republic, it has to be complemented by a&#13;
range o f public actions to ensure that poor people benefit, as well as the most&#13;
vulnerable amongthe poor.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Preliminary assessments indicate an increase in the percentage o f people&#13;
living at or below the poverty line and a general worseningof livingconditions across&#13;
income groups. A qualitative study completed in December 2004 on the social&#13;
dimensions of the economic crisis, which the SCRAL aims to ameliorate, revealed&#13;
that poor households responded to the decline in real incomes by removing their&#13;
children from school, reducing food consumption, and eliminating services (phone,&#13;
gas and electricity). Years o f slow, albeit important, reduction o f poverty rates and&#13;
improved living standards were reversed, all o f which weaken the country's capacity&#13;
to meetthe MDGs by 2005. Inaddition, the country's capacity to meet the MDGs by&#13;
2015 hasbeen affected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.      Poor households have been disproportionately affected by the crisis given&#13;
their higher levels of unemployment, especially among women and youth, and&#13;
inability to offset income losses forcing them to cut back on consumption. The most&#13;
important impact o f the crisis came from the high inflation resulting from the sharp&#13;
currency depreciation. Food, medicine and transport prices became prohibitive for&#13;
large segments o f the population and the reduction in fiscal revenues and in public&#13;
investment, combined with the increase in the price o f commodities, i s affecting the&#13;
provision o f basic social services and social programs. In addition, the electricity&#13;
sector crisis has had serious social repercussions, with electricity blackouts resulting&#13;
in increased crime and violence and electricity shortages for basic hospital&#13;
procedures. The earthquake, floods and hurricanes that hit the country in 2003 and&#13;
2004 compounded the already serious social situation, and impacted the most&#13;
vulnerable populationthe hardest.&#13;
&#13;
Social Sector Reforms&#13;
&#13;
7.      In February 2004 the Government began an ambitious set of social sector&#13;
reforms, almost all o f which are on track, although slightly behind schedule. This&#13;
includes eight major reforms which are included in Schedule 3 o f the S C M L Loan&#13;
Agreement for Floating Tranche "A", four of which have been fully complied with&#13;
andfour o fwhich are intheprocess o f fulfillment(expected byMarch 31,2005).&#13;
&#13;
8.      These actions included:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0  Full financing of a universal school feeding program reaching 1.6 million&#13;
       children ingrades 1-8 each day, and the launching o f a comprehensive impact&#13;
       evaluation of this program (the contract for the evaluation was signed by&#13;
       February28,2005);&#13;
&#13;
       Implementation o f a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program for 100,000&#13;
       poor mothers who send their children to primary school, including the&#13;
       development o f a comprehensive operational manual satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
       which uses a proxy-means test for beneficiary selection (the latter i s a&#13;
       completed condition for Floating Tranche "A");&#13;
&#13;
    0  Enrollment o f 70,000 poor families in the subsidized component o f the&#13;
       national health insurance system (a fulfilled condition for Floating Tranche&#13;
       "A" still awaitingfinalverification ofthehealthinsurancedatabase);&#13;
&#13;
       Continuationo f a policy allowing undocumented children to enroll inprimary&#13;
       school, benefiting at least 20,000 youth in school year 2004-2005 (fulfilled),&#13;
       and provision o f over 6,000 birth certificates to previously undocumented&#13;
       children (Floating Tranche "A" conditionality requires             11,000 birth&#13;
       certificates issued);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   Support from the National Council o f Social Security to                12,000&#13;
   undocumented families, identifiedas otherwise available to participate innon-&#13;
   contributory health insurance system, to obtain their identity cards (activities&#13;
   are underway as o f January 2005);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0 Development o f an Operational Manual satisfactory to the Bank by the&#13;
  National Institute for Price Stabilization (INESPRE) for a targeted food&#13;
   subsidy program, and commencement of this program (a completed condition&#13;
  for Floating Tranche "A");&#13;
&#13;
   Satisfactory protection of priority social programs in the 2004 and 2005&#13;
  NationalBudget (fulfilled);&#13;
&#13;
  Continued legal reform o f the health sector, including (i)   promulgation by&#13;
  presidential decree o f the "Regulation o f Human Resources in the National&#13;
  Health System" (a completed condition for Floating Tranche "A"), (ii)&#13;
  approval by the Secretary o f Public Health and Social Assistance (SESPAS)&#13;
  o f the Resolution which initiates the separation o f fimctions in the health&#13;
  sector, by which i s authorized the creation o f Regional Public Health Service&#13;
  Providers (not a condition o f Floating Tranche "A"), and (iii)  revision of the&#13;
  process for categorizing beneficiaries for the non-contributory health&#13;
  insurance system acceptable to the Bank (a completed condition for Floating&#13;
  Tranche "A");&#13;
&#13;
  Promulgation o f a presidential decree ordering the elimination o f eight&#13;
  ineffective social programs (a completed condition for FloatingTranche "A");&#13;
&#13;
  Updating o f the Operational Manual and econometric formula used to select&#13;
  beneficiaries according to levels o f poverty, approved by the Social Cabinet,&#13;
  and updating o f the national poverty map using 2002 Census data&#13;
  (completed); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0 Contracting o f five civil society organizations to monitor government&#13;
  implementation o f key social programs supported by the S C M L (school&#13;
  feeding, the CCT program, support to undocumented families, the targeted&#13;
  food subsidyprogram, etc.), and submission o f their reports to Government (a&#13;
  partially completed conditionfor Floating Tranche "A").&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    9.      In addition, the Government has moved forward with overall reform of the&#13;
    health sector with the approval by Congress inDecember 2004 o f the World Bank's&#13;
    Health Sector Reform Adaptable Programmatic Loan and its                 subsequent&#13;
    effectiveness, and it has substantially improved its nationalHIV/AIDSprevention and&#13;
    control programs.     Inthe education sector, the Government announced in early&#13;
    February 2005 its intention to work with all major donors on the preparation and&#13;
    implementation o f a Sector Wide Approach (SWAP), which should significantly&#13;
    improve access and quality o f education over the next few years.&#13;
&#13;
    10.     Finally, the Fernandez Government launched in August 2004 the Unified&#13;
    System for Beneficiary Selection (Sistema Unico de Beneficiarios, STCTBEN), a&#13;
    sophisticated system which uses the updated National Poverty Map and household&#13;
    surveys in areas o f extreme poverty to identify those households most in need of&#13;
    public social programs. SIUBENwill be used for targeting o f almost all public social&#13;
    programs, which should greatly improve efficiency, transparency and effectiveness o f&#13;
    these programs, while reducing indiscriminate use o f social programs for political&#13;
    purposes (a long-time tradition inthe DominicanRepublic).&#13;
&#13;
        11. PROGRESSINMEETING FLOATINGTRANCHE RELEASE "B"&#13;
              CONDITIONSRELATEDTO THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR&#13;
&#13;
    11.     General Condition: The status o f the two general conditions associated with&#13;
    the Loani s as follows:&#13;
&#13;
        The macroeconomic policy framework o f the Borrower is satisfactory.       This&#13;
        condition is met, as a result of the assessment of the country's macroeconomic&#13;
       performance inSection Iabove.&#13;
       The progress achieved by the Borrower in carrying out the Program i s&#13;
        satisfactory. This condition is met, as demonstrated inparagraphs 12-16 below.&#13;
       The actions described in Schedule 4 o f this Agreement have been taken in form&#13;
       and substance satisfactory to the Bank. This condition is met. Government&#13;
       performance in meeting each o f the 3 specific conditions for floating tranche&#13;
       release "B" i s described below inParagraphs 12 - 16.&#13;
&#13;
    12.     Condition 1.       The Borrower has delivered at least US$30,000,000&#13;
   equivalent worth of fuel to domestic electricity generators, financed through its&#13;
   national budget. This condition is met. In May 2004, the Government submitted to&#13;
   the World Bank all receipts and invoices which showed purchases o f fuel equivalent&#13;
   to US$30,000,000, financed through its national budget, for the purpose o f domestic&#13;
   electricity generation.    In addition, the Government submitted evidence which&#13;
   demonstrated "merit-based dispatch" such that the most efficient electricity&#13;
   generators were givenpriority for fuel purposes.&#13;
&#13;
   13.     Condition 2. CDE has continued to supply at least 80 Gwh per month for&#13;
   purposes of the PRA.'      This condition is met. Energy supply by the regional&#13;
`"Program  de Reducci6nde Apagones"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
distribution companies ("the Edes") to the PRA over the 12-month period from&#13;
January-December 2004 averaged 73 Gwh per month, or 91 percent o f the SCRAL&#13;
target. Because there is an electricity transmission loss o f approximately 3 percent,&#13;
the CDE actually provided slightly more than this amount of energy to the regional&#13;
distribution companies (EdeSur, EdeEste and EdeNorte). If this is included, actual&#13;
CDE energy supply rises to 73 GWhper month, or 91 percent o fthe SCRAL target.&#13;
&#13;
14.      It is worth noting that during the first nine months of 2004 average monthly&#13;
energy supply to the PF2A banios was 81.8 Gwh. Supply to the PRA fell duringthe&#13;
last three months o f 2004 as production o f hydroelectricity during this period fell by&#13;
24 percent compared to the first nine months o f 2004. Hydro power i s the primary&#13;
(and cheapest) source o f energy for the PRA. Ifthe Government had continued full&#13;
PRA supply through electricity generated by fuel imports the macroeconomic&#13;
situation would have been negatively affected.&#13;
&#13;
15.      Inview of (i) decline in hydroelectric power generation inthe last three&#13;
                         the&#13;
months o f 2004, (ii) Government's commitment to maintain the PRA in 2005 at&#13;
                        the&#13;
the same levels (or even higher, should hydroelectric supply be sufficient), and (iii)&#13;
the many other electricity sector reforms underway as part o f preparation o f the&#13;
World Bank Power Sector Adjustment Loan, due for Board presentation in May&#13;
2005, this i s satisfactory performance.&#13;
&#13;
16.      Condition 3. TheBorrower hasfrozen the electricity tar$%,payable by users&#13;
consuming less than 200 kwh per month, at levels no greater than those as of&#13;
December 1,2003. This condition i s met. The Government has submitted evidence&#13;
to the World Bank, consisting o f formal resolutions o f the Superintendent o f&#13;
Electricity, which confirm that the tariffs for consumers o f less than 200 kwh per&#13;
month remain unchanged from December 2003 to January 2005. These resolutions&#13;
were issued on a monthly basis, and included tariff increases on consumers o f more&#13;
than 200 kwh, an essential step towards financial sustainability o fthe energy sector.&#13;
&#13;
                                  111. CONCLUSION&#13;
&#13;
17.     In view of the overall satisfactory performance and progress with the&#13;
implementationo f the program supported by the Loan, including the macroeconomic&#13;
framework andthe specific conditions o f releasereferredto inSchedule 4 o fthe Loan&#13;
Agreement, the Bank has informed the Borrower o f the availability for disbursement&#13;
o fthe floating tranche "B" o f the Loan inthe equivalent o fUS$25 million.&#13;

            Dominican Republic - Social Crisis Response
            Adjustment Loan: Release of Floating Tranche B Based on Full Compliance
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Social Crisis Response Adjustment
            Loan (SCRAL) will help the Dominican Republic cope with the
            current economic and social crisis and to stimulate overdue
            and continuing reforms in both the social and electricity
            sectors. Floating Tranche B is focused on the electricity
            sector and contains three conditions to ensure: (a) supply
            of imported fuel to generate electricity; (b) supply of
            electricity to poor households; and (c) affordability of
            electricity by poor households, by freezing tariffs for
            those consuming less than 200 kilowatt hours per month. In
            view of the overall satisfactory performance and progress
            with the implementation of the program supported by the
            Loan, including the macroeconomic framework and the specific
            conditions of release of the Loan Agreement, the Bank has
            informed the Borrower of the availability for disbursement
            of the floating tranche B of the Loan in the equivalent of
            US$25 million.
