Counties are required by law to put in place legislation on public participation to give full&#13;
effect to the County Government Act (CGA 92). A Public Participation Framework provides a&#13;
roadmap for implementing participation at devolved level, subsequently improving its quality.&#13;
Quality participation can eliminate or minimize risks often associated with devolution.                                               Kenya School of Government&#13;

&#13;
                                                                                            Phase 1: Needs Identification&#13;
                                                                                            During this phase, the County Executive through the Planning Unit will organize community meetings&#13;
                                                                                            and stakeholder forums to contribute to establishing the types of problems facing the county and the&#13;
                                                                                            causes of the problems (social mapping). A priority is to ensure that all key stakeholders that are affected&#13;

and should benefit from the planning are identified and mobilized. The Planning Directorate under the&#13;
Ministry of Devolution and Planning has proposed a stakeholder map and working process for engaging&#13;
with the different stakeholder groups.2 The stakeholders, with guidance from the Planning team, identify&#13;
and assess problems for priority attention. Problems can be identified by critically analyzing the countyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
history and trends or patterns, such as recurrent drought or floods that can be classified as prevalent&#13;
problems. The meetings may be held in sub-group sessions dealing with specific development issues&#13;
affecting groups or regions and plenary sessions. Decisions should be minuted and records kept by the&#13;
County Planning Unit.&#13;
&#13;
Phase 2: Situation Analysis&#13;
The Planning Unit will further engage communities to find solutions to the problems identified in&#13;
Phase 1. This phase involves more data collection and analysis. Participatory information gathering and&#13;
analysis contributes to a shared understanding of issues. The engagement can be through public debates&#13;
on what can work best in solving a problem or more specifically tailored towards meetings with affected&#13;
groups, communities, or experts to provide input to development solutions.   Consulting the affected&#13;
groups is critical for identifying the correct solution to a felt need. For instance, one county government&#13;
records an experience where after constructing a water pipeline near a village to ensure women would&#13;
not walk long distances, found that the pipeline was not being used. The women still walked long&#13;
distances to the borehole. On making inquiries, the CG established that the distant borehole afforded&#13;
women opportunity and time to meet with their friends. Primary data may be obtained through a variety&#13;
of processes, including Focus Group Discussions, deliberative meetings, or Participatory Rural Appraisal&#13;
(PRA), which involves largely visual techniques for communities to study a problem affecting them,&#13;
evaluate options for solving the problem, and come up with an action plan. Meetings with NGOs may&#13;
be very helpful in addressing thematic issues in their area of specialization, such as health, water and&#13;
sanitation. Information gathered from the consultative processes should be collated and combined with&#13;
secondary data from formal baseline studies, opinion polls and other statistics into a formal development&#13;
report that constitutes the first two chapters of the CIDPâ&#128;&#148;on County Background Information and Socio-&#13;
economic Development Challenges and Strategies. It would also be useful for counties to provide the&#13;
public with comparative data on the countyâ&#128;&#153;s performance vis a vis other counties on various service&#13;
delivery metrics.&#13;
&#13;
Phase 3: Strategy Setting&#13;
During this phase the county proposes its vision, defines development objectives in clear statements to&#13;
deal with problems identified and strategies to achieve the objectives. This may be conducted during a&#13;
one day forum, bringing together experts, citizen representatives, NGOs, professional associations and&#13;
other key stakeholders. This phase leads to the identification of specific projects to achieve the objectives.&#13;
Counties may also consider encouraging institutions or community based groups to present project or&#13;
program proposals which can be included in the CIDP through prioritization process.&#13;
&#13;
Phase 4: Projects&#13;
The county will work on the design and content of projects identified in Phase 3. Project sub-committees&#13;
or working groups are established and citizen representatives can sit in these. It would be ideal that the&#13;
working groups be aligned to sectors. Clear details are worked out in terms of who will benefit from&#13;
projects, the cost of the project, how it will be funded, project duration, mode of execution and overall&#13;
management of the project.&#13;
&#13;
Phase 5: Integration&#13;
Once all projects have been identified, the County Executive will verify that they contribute to meeting the&#13;
objectives outlined in Phase 3. The projects will provide an overall picture of the development plan. The&#13;
Executive will also ensure that the plan is in harmony with overall national level and sector plans.&#13;

Some counties have already passed public participation bills that further give effect to the public&#13;
participation framework stipulated under the CGA, PFMA and Urban Areas and Cities Act. Laikipia&#13;
County, for instance, establishes: a Public Participation Office under the County Assembly with overall&#13;
responsibility for providing advice on the participation process; and, a Department of Public Participation&#13;
under the County Executive to coordinate public participation by other departments or agencies.&#13;
&#13;
3.1 Phase 1: The Budget Formulation Process&#13;
The Budget Cycle begins with the release of the Budget Circular and Calendar. The Budget Circular&#13;
usually includes: a budget planning calendar, instructions for preparing budget plans, indication of&#13;
available funds, overall priority directions from executive leadership, and entry points and procedures&#13;
for inviting public input to the process. Table 3 outlines a typical budget calendar highlighting the&#13;
requirements for public participation as per the PFM module on Budget Preparation developed by the&#13;
National Treasury and the KSG.&#13;

Participation in budgetary processes involves a variety of mechanisms to enhance citizensâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
involvement. Foremost are efforts to improve citizensâ&#128;&#153; and civil societyâ&#128;&#153;s understanding of the budget&#13;
process, and to increase budget literacy through training and dissemination of information. However,&#13;
effort must also be made to mobilize communities and provide an entry point for them to participate&#13;
within the budget process. A successful consultative process therefore begins with adequate preparation,&#13;
as this will determine issue-based deliberation and clear rules of engagement.&#13;
&#13;
3.1.1 Preparatory activities for citizen engagement in budget formulation&#13;
Sharing of the Budget Circular and Calendar: When the County Budget Circular is issued by the Chief&#13;
Executive Committee (CEC) Member of Finance, it should be disseminated to all those within the county&#13;
government that will be involved in the planning and budget process, as well as non-state actors.&#13;
&#13;
Forming a Technical Team: The County Executive could form a Technical Team to lead the consultative&#13;
process. The Team should include technical officials from the Finance Office, Planning Department, and the&#13;
relevant office in charge of citizen engagementâ&#128;&#148;which could be the Department of Public Participation&#13;
or Office of Public Affairs. This team should work closely with the County Budget and Economic Forum&#13;
(CBEF) and, ideally, already be part of the CBEF. The team should coordinate consultative activities, and&#13;
assign roles and responsibilities to ensure sustainability, efficiency and effectiveness during the budgetary&#13;
process. This would involve identifying members from the executive team who should serve in sector&#13;
working groups, liaise with ward and village administrative representatives, and brief them on what they&#13;
need to do prior to the forums. The team should also ensure that the budget set aside for dissemination of&#13;
information and consultative forums is adequate.&#13;

(a)	 Conduct an information campaign to: educate citizens about budgets and the key documents that&#13;
     require their input, including the budget calendar; and, provide them with basic information on what&#13;
     participation hopes to achieve, what is at stake, and citizen roles in the decision making process.&#13;
     Citizens primarily need to understand that they have an important role in the entire budget cycle.&#13;
     Specifically:&#13;
     â&#128;¢	 To participate in public hearings on the CIDP, C-BROP, Sector Reports and Budget Estimates.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	 In identifying community needs and priorities, through the country development plans planning&#13;
        process.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	 In providing oversight and feedback on programs and projects, particularly on the use of public&#13;
        resources.&#13;
     â&#128;¢	 There are several complex documents that citizens are required to engage with and provide input&#13;
        to. Counties could provide simple explanations and user friendly versions of these documents to&#13;
        the citizens as follows:&#13;
(b)	 Develop and disseminate Financial Transparency Tools: This will include the design of highly simplified&#13;
     budget and expenditure formats which convey the essence of planned and actual expenditures,&#13;
     usually by sector. The templates would primarily use pictorial icons, keeping text and numbers to an&#13;
     absolute minimum, so that even minimally literate citizens can understand the proposed budgetary&#13;
     allocations and expenditures. Service Facility Templatesâ&#128;&#148;simplified templates which show resource&#13;
     allocations received by individual schools, clinics, agricultural extension offices, etc.â&#128;&#148;are also useful&#13;
     tools that can convey simple messages to citizens. County governments can work jointly with civil&#13;
     society in developing these tools; county government engagement in the design and implementation&#13;
     of these tools is integral in ensuring uniformity of design and widespread utilization. In Nakuru County,&#13;
     the Executive worked jointly with CSOs to develop popular versions of the 2014/15 budget and CIDP.&#13;
(c)	 Direct capacity building efforts toward a broader view of community priorities: Citizens should be&#13;
     encouraged to look at the county as a whole rather than focusing on the problems specific to their&#13;
     locality or neighborhood. This is part of the larger empowerment or citizenship school component of&#13;
     the participatory budgeting process where citizens are encouraged to envision and work for broader&#13;
     social change. Whereas such change encourages equity, it should not overlook small projects with&#13;

    â&#128;¢	 Budget estimates.&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 The budget envelope within which citizens can prioritize&#13;
&#13;
Using this information the county explains to citizens the financial situation for the current year, the&#13;
financial performance of previous year, the basis of revenues and expenditures, how resources were&#13;
spent, what was realized and the potential and constrains for the next fiscal year. It is important to&#13;
present the forecasts in revenues and expenditures so that the participants become acquainted with&#13;
potential budget limitations. The session should aim at managing unrealistic expectations such as&#13;
unemployment disappearing, and immediate reduction of poverty and inequality. The county should&#13;
provide an overview of its current policies and spending priorities. As discussed earlier, this information&#13;
should be shared in simple formats.&#13;
&#13;
During this session, the county will also explain to citizens what is required of them. This is important&#13;
given the fact that the complexity of the budget issues requires that citizens and their representatives&#13;
have substantial technical and analytical understanding to weigh the relevance of different arguments.&#13;
The session should close with a Question and Answer session where the county addresses any concerns&#13;
and clarifications raised by citizens.&#13;
&#13;
Step 2:	 Situation and problem analysis meetings by ward, zone or stakeholder groups (Break â&#128;&#147;&#13;
         away session)&#13;
This session is intended to assist the public with identifying their problems and needs. Citizens must be&#13;
in a position to identify the real issues affecting the development of their county. A neutral facilitator&#13;
selected from amongst the group, preferably in the civil society, can chair these sessions. The specific&#13;
activities include:&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 The citizens, civil society representatives, and community leaders identify the problems and needs&#13;
       in their specific areas of concern and assisted by county officials assess the technical and financial&#13;
       feasibility of possible solutions;&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 The county staff such as ward representatives and technical teams also assists the citizens in defining&#13;
       their demands and priorities. At this stage therefore, citizens will be required to identify and list&#13;
       down those activities that should be done to provide solutions to the identified problems and&#13;
       needs. Citizens then evaluate spending priorities and vote on which ones should be implemented&#13;
       under the new budget; and&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Citizen representatives should finally be chosen to make the groupâ&#128;&#153;s presentation and for any&#13;
       follow up engagement such as monitoring and evaluation or involvement in social audit reporting.&#13;
&#13;
Step 3: Decision Making Plenary Session&#13;
A number of problems and priorities will have been identified in Step 2, but it is not often possible to solve&#13;
all these problems at once hence the need to prioritize which problems will be addressed first. In this&#13;
stage, the CBEF may lead the citizens in coming up with:&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 A prioritization criteria and matrix;&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Decision making mechanisms for priorities.&#13;
&#13;
The representatives from the various zones make presentations, and this is followed by negotiations on&#13;
thematic priorities among the participants in order to ensure final decisions are broadly representative&#13;
of county needs. The CBEF should encourage citizens to think about their interests broadly, to make&#13;

The County Executive submits the Budget Proposal to the Assembly, which then convenes public&#13;
hearings that could be similar in format to the formulation process, but focus this time is on the&#13;
evaluation of budget priorities and allocation of resources. At this stage, budget representatives from&#13;
the sub-county or ward level should be present to determine whether programs and activities that&#13;
map onto priority needs as identified by citizens are given priority funding in the final budget. Table 7&#13;
presents some key questions developed by civil society organizations on the kind of questions the County&#13;
Assembly and citizens need to ask.4 The County Assembly should ensure feedback from the forums is fed&#13;
back into the budget.&#13;

            Practical approaches for county governments
            to facilitate public participation in the planning and
            budget process
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Kenya's new Constitution and
            supportive legal framework contain multiple provisions
            requiring both national government and counties to make
            information publicly available and consult with citizens in
            planning and budgeting. Citizen participation affords county
            governments an opportunity to empower citizens on their
            operations and to deliberate, debate, and influence the
            allocation of public resources. This working paper presents
            practical approaches for Kenyan counties to implement public
            participation in their systems that encourage meaningful
            public engagement.
