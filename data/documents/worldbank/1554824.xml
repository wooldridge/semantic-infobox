Abstract&#13;
This collection of papers discusses a number of issues related to&#13;
manpower analysis and educational investment in developing countries. Much of&#13;
the debate in this area over the last two decades has centered on the related&#13;
merits of the manpower requirements forecasting and rate of return&#13;
approaches.   While the theoretical weaknesses of manpower      forecasting have&#13;
been widely discussed and ex-post evaluations have revealed substantial&#13;
forecasting errors, this methodology still dominates government manpower&#13;
planning agencies and development assistance agencies.      The authors of this&#13;
volume suggest a broader approach to the analysis of the relationship between&#13;
manpower  and  the  educational   system.   It  is  contended  that  forcing  all&#13;
manpower questions inl:o any single analytical framework wiLl result in low&#13;
quality analysis and Low quality educational investments.      Consequently, the&#13;
use of a wide range of techniques is advocated and discussed.     A second aspect&#13;
of the argument advanced in this volume is the need for continuity of manpower&#13;
analysis through the development of a planning process which goes well beyond&#13;
the identification and preparation of a specific education project.        Such a&#13;
continuous framework for analysis and policymaking, it is suggested, can be&#13;
provided through the construction and repetition of an "annual routine" to be&#13;
performed by a government planning unit.    Such a routine consists of specific&#13;
tasks designed to continually monitor conditions in the labor market so as to&#13;
provide a regular set of relevant signals to a wide range cf decision-makers&#13;
in the education and training sector.&#13;
- iii -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
These papers do not provide a new blueprint for manpower analysis.&#13;
They take stock of the present situation, advocate the replacement of a&#13;
dominant technique by a well structured planning process and begin to suggest&#13;
the wide range of analytic approaches available and necessary if manpower&#13;
analysis is to be improved within this process.&#13;

La presente serie d'etudes traite de divers aspects analytiques&#13;
de la mainrd'oeuvre et des investissements dans l'education dans les pays&#13;
en developpement. Ces vingt dernieres annees, les debats ont porte essen-&#13;
tiellement sur les avantages respectifs des approches fondees sur la pre-&#13;
vision des besoins de main-d'oeuvre et le taux de rentabilite. Bien que&#13;
les faiblesses theoriques des previsions de main-d'oeuvre aient ete lar-&#13;
gement soulignees et que les evaluations retrospectives aient revele&#13;
d'importantes erreurs de prevision, cette approche est encore la plus&#13;
utilisee par les services officiels de planification de la main-d'oeuvre&#13;
et les organismes d'aide au developpement. Les auteurs du present docu-&#13;
ment suggerent d'analyser dans une perspective plus large les relations&#13;
entre la main-d'oeuvre et le systeme d'education.   Ils affirment qu'a&#13;
vouloir etudier toutes les questions de main-d'oeuvre dans un cadre unique&#13;
quel qu'il soit, on obtient forcement une analyse et des investissements&#13;
dans l'ducation de qualite mediocre. Aussi recommandent-ils d'utiliser&#13;
toute une gamme de techniques. Ils soulignent aussi la necessite d'assu-&#13;
rer la continuite de l'analyse en mettant au point un processus de pla-&#13;
nification allant bien au-dela de l'identification et de la preparation&#13;
d'un projet d'education donne. Pour ce cadre d'analyse et de prise de deci-&#13;
sion, les auteurs suggerent la definition de "taches annuelles" a confier&#13;
a un service officiel de planification. I1 s'agira de taches sp6cifiques&#13;
visant a contro^ler continuellement la situation sur le marche du travail&#13;
de maniare a donner regulierement les signaux appropries a un grand&#13;
nombre de decideurs dans le secteur de l1'ducation et de la formation.&#13;
Ces etudes ne proposent pas un nouveau schema d'analyse de la&#13;
main-d'oeuvre. Les auteurs font le point de la situation, recommandent&#13;
de remplacer la technique actuellement la plus utilisee par ull processus&#13;
de planification structure et laissent entrevoir le vaste eventail de&#13;
methodes analytiques disponibles, qu'il est indispensable d'adopter si&#13;
l'on veut que ce processus permette d'ameliorer l'analyse de :La&#13;

Extracto&#13;
En la colecci6n de documentos que aqui se presenta se estudian varias&#13;
cuestiones  relacionadas   con  el  analisis  de  los  recursos  humanos    y   las&#13;
inversiones para educaci6n en los paises en desarrollo. Gran parte del debate&#13;
sostenido en esta esfera durante los "dos ultimos decenios se ha centrado en los&#13;
meritos conexos de los enfoques para pronosticar las necesidades de recursos&#13;
humanos y  para   evaluar  la  tasa  d;e rentabilidad.   Aunque   las  deficiencias&#13;
te6ricas   de    los  pron6sticos  sobre  recursos  humanos  han  sido   examinadas&#13;
extensamente  y   las  evaluaciones  ex  post  han  revelado  errores  de   calculo&#13;
considerables, esta metodologia predomina aun en los organismos oficiales de&#13;
planificaci6n de la educaci6n y en ,las instituciones de asistencia para el&#13;
desarrollo.   Los   autores  del  pres,ente  volumen sugieren un enfoque mas amplio&#13;
para el analisis de las relaciones entre los recursos humanos y el sistema&#13;
educacional.   Sostienen que la consideraci6n de todas las cuestiones relativas a&#13;
los recursos humanos dentro de un solo marco analitico dara por resultado&#13;
analisis   deficientes    e   inversiones   educacionales  de  baja   calidad.   En&#13;
consecuencia, se propugna y analiza una amplia   gama  de  tecnicas.   El   segundo&#13;
aspecto del argumento presentado en el volumen es la necesidad de asegurar la&#13;
continuidad del analisis de los recursos humanos mediante la elaboraci6n de un&#13;
proceso de planificaci6n que vayal mucho mas alla de la identificaci6n y&#13;
preparaci6n de un determinado proyecto de educaci6n. Se sugiere que el marco&#13;
continuo para los analisis y la adopci6n de politicas puede obtenerse elaborando&#13;
y estableciendo una "rutina anual" que ha de estar a cargo de una dependencia de&#13;
planificaci6n   gubernamental.   Dicho, proceso rutinario consiste en una serie de&#13;
tareas especificas encaminadas a examinar de manera continua la situaci6n del&#13;
mercado   laboral  a  fin  de proporcionar regularmente un conjunto de indicadores&#13;
pertinentes a la amplia gama de funcionarios responsables de adoptar las&#13;
decisiones en el sector de la educaci6n y la capacitaci6n.&#13;
En estos documentos no se presenta un nuevo patr6n para el analisis de&#13;
los  recursos  humanos.   En   ellos  se evaluia la situaci6n actual, se recomienda&#13;
reemplazar  la  tecnica   predominante  por  un  proceso  de  planificaci6n    bien&#13;
estructurado y se empieza a insinuar la gran variedad de metodos analiticos&#13;
disponibles y necesarios a fin de mejorar el analisis de los recursos humanos&#13;
dentro de ese proceso.&#13;

1.  INTRODUCTION&#13;
The development of alternative planning methodologies for educational&#13;
projects occurred in the 1960's arid the, often acrimonious, debate over them&#13;
has taken place continuously since     then in the academic    literature.   This&#13;
debate has concentrated particularly on the relative merits of manpower&#13;
forecasting and rate of return analysis.    It is, perhaps, inevitable that when&#13;
practitioners witness the recurring and repetitive controversies waged by&#13;
advocates of competing analytical approaches a cynical attitude develops&#13;
towards all forms of analysis.      This, to some extent, has occurred in the&#13;
field of manpower planning, and particulary in the developing countries.      The&#13;
experience of developrment agencies and government manpower development bodies&#13;
suggests that the amount of economic and labor market analysis relating to&#13;
education projects is limited and that that which is made generally utilizes a&#13;
single format applied in a casual way.    Furthermore, it appears that while the&#13;
criticisms of that format - manpower forecasting - have been widely accepted&#13;
by education planners, the latter have no faith in suggested alternatives such&#13;
as rate of return analysis.     At the same time, however, it remains the case&#13;
that planners continue to operate under the requirement: to provide an&#13;
economic/manpower justification for education projects.&#13;
The papers included in this volume begin from the perspective that&#13;
the search for a single methodology with which to approach all manpower issues&#13;
is self defeating and that the concentration on planning techniques should be&#13;
at  least  complemented   by  a  concentration  on   the  planning  process.    In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
addition, it is argued that if the claims of, andtexpectations from, manpower&#13;
planning were reduced the actual results cog.djiXe increased. I/&#13;
This introductory chapter basically sets the scene for the detailed&#13;
chapters by Dougherty and Hollister by&#13;
-    discussing in a formal, generalised way, the economic approach to the&#13;
analysis of education's contribution to social welfare objectives,&#13;
-    summarising the rationales which governwenvs nave explicitly used in&#13;
practice to justify educational exDansioiL over the last twenty years&#13;
- one of which has been manpower development-and the changing&#13;
emphasis between these criteria,&#13;
-    focusing, briefly, on the debate coneeruing the appropriate technique&#13;
to  appraise   educational   projects   from  a   manpower   development&#13;
perspective,&#13;
-    and, finally, introducing the perspective which is developed     further&#13;
by the other authors that the formulatiQn of a planning process which&#13;
stresses  adequate   information,  consist~ency  in  decisionmaking,  an&#13;
explicit framework for choice, cost comparisons, a wide range of&#13;
planning techniques and a discipline XMposed by a planning process&#13;
rather than by a planning technique might now be the appropriate step&#13;
forward for manpower development planning.&#13;
1/  While in general the authors would maintain that much of their argument is&#13;
also relevant for evaluating manpower development and educational policies&#13;
in industrialized countries,    this position   is. not  followed  through  in&#13;
these  papers.   While  not  being  aware   of  any  recent  breakthrough  or&#13;
improvements in labor market forcasting in these countries which could&#13;
potentially be incorporated into developing countries' planning efforts,&#13;
it cannot be said for certain that they have not occurred.     If they have,&#13;
this would be a subject matter for anotheT wuuy-beyond the scope of this&#13;
volume.&#13;

2.    A GENERALISED FRAMEWORK FOR THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF&#13;
OBJECTIVES OF EDUCATION PROJECTS&#13;
Several disciplines have come     to be associated with     the study cf&#13;
education   and  have   relevance   for  planning   decisions.   Anong   them   are&#13;
sociology, psychology, statistics, philosophy and economics.       In the area of&#13;
educational planning, economists have forced themselves into ascendancy in the&#13;
last two decades, particularly in developing countries.       An important reason&#13;
for this is the potentially systematic and rigorous framework for the analysis&#13;
of several components of the planning process which economists have claimed&#13;
can be provided by them.&#13;
In a general planning framework, the overall objective is to maximise&#13;
social welfare.   This, in turn, is regarded as having a number of components,&#13;
each of which can be assigned diEferent weights according to the view taken of&#13;
their  respective   importance.    Components   of  the  welfare   (or  objective)&#13;
function may,  for instance, be economic production and distributive equity.&#13;
This choice of components is the result of a normative (subjective) decision&#13;
as is the next step of applying weights to the components to reflect whether&#13;
or not, and to what extent, it is judged that an increase in production is&#13;
more important for social welfare than an increase in equal[ty.       Finally, the&#13;
educational planner needs to specify how each of the components can be&#13;
affected by changes in policy variables in the educational system.      One set of&#13;
variables affecting gross national product could be school enrollments in the&#13;
different schooling levels. To incorporate these into the function then&#13;
requires a further set of weights to indicate the extent to which changes in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
enrollments  affect  economic  output.    Two  points  should  be  added.   These&#13;
weights can be empirically derived from studies of the economic contribution&#13;
of schooling, and the effects of enrollment expansion on income distribution&#13;
can also be incorporated in the function in a similar way.&#13;
The discussion above covers a very formal framework.     Even if such a&#13;
framework is not explicit, however, the thought processes behind it, including&#13;
the  derivation  of   weights,  are  useful   and  can  be  used  to  attempt  to&#13;
systematize the analysis of educational projects directed to a wide range of&#13;
objectives.   These objectives include disseminating and inculcating a sense of&#13;
national identity and a shared set of values, increasing the quality and&#13;
achievement levels in schooling, reducing school failure and dropout rates,&#13;
increasing and equalising access to schooling among class, regional, ethnic&#13;
and racial groups, and so on.    How a specific educational program affects one&#13;
of these, how that then influences one of the social welfare components and&#13;
how that in turn influences social welfare itself are questions which the&#13;
modelling approach outlined above in its expanded form attempts to answer.&#13;
Another perspective on the way in which economists have viewed issues&#13;
of educational policy is through their traditional concern with efficiency.&#13;
This has led to an interest in comparing the value of resources used in a&#13;
given program with the additional resources made available as a result of the&#13;
program, in documenting the effects on educational achievement of a given&#13;
program of educational expenditure, and in comparing the economic costs of&#13;
various approaches aimed at a similar objective.     A way of classifying these&#13;
interests has been through the use of the terms internal efficiency and&#13;
external efficiency.    Internal efficiency considerations center on input      -&#13;
output  relationships   within  the  educational   system.   That  is,  they  are&#13;
concerned with analysing the effects of both school and non-school (eg. family&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
background) variables on educational achievement and on the impact which&#13;
increases or changes in school related variables may have (eg. increased&#13;
provision of   textbooks).   External   efficiency  concerns  link  up  different&#13;
levels  of   educational   achievement  of   graduates   with  their   consequent&#13;
experience, most commonly in the labor market.       The ways of assessing this&#13;
experience and, hence, of judging the external efficiency of schooling has&#13;
formed much of the basis for the controversies within the economics of&#13;
education over the last two decades.&#13;
3.   RATIONALES IN EDUCATIONAL PLANS&#13;
It is instructive to move from the formal framework of the economic&#13;
analysis of education projects to the actual justifications which have been&#13;
made for educational expansion in developing countries' national        plans.  A&#13;
survey and categorisation of these justifications has recently been made by&#13;
Lewin, Little and Cclclough (1982), based on 29 plans f'rom 16 countries&#13;
throughout Africa, Asia and Latin America and covering the planning period&#13;
from 1965 to 1985.&#13;
Five sets of objectives for educational development were identified:&#13;
a)   Manpower development.   Here, the objectives were stated at very&#13;
different levels of specificity from general statements that the&#13;
future expansion of the economy required a more highly educated&#13;
labor  f'orce  to   the  specific   enumeration   of  occupational&#13;
requirements.&#13;
b)   Increased social equity.     Equity rationales   tend to focus   on&#13;
increasing the access of particular regional, ethnic or racial&#13;
groups to educational opportunities.    This rat:ionale is closely&#13;
related to arguments that education is a human right and is&#13;
expressed most strongly in the case of primary and lower&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
secondary   schooling.   In   countries  with   significant   ethnic  or   racial&#13;
diversity, however, the desire to widen access of particular groups to higher&#13;
levels of education has also been a determinant of policy.         Few plans go&#13;
beyond focusing on these groupings to explicitly formulate expansionary&#13;
programs for relatively deprived social classes.&#13;
c)   Nationbuilding.   The important role which education can play in&#13;
developing a shared national identity among the youth is another&#13;
frequently used rationale for expansion.    This is expressed most&#13;
openly in those countries which have a diversity of peoples but&#13;
variants of this rationale are also expressed in countries which&#13;
are   consciously  attempting   to   consolidate  or   change   the&#13;
ideological orientation of the population.     In such countries,&#13;
the socialisation of students with a shared set of values and&#13;
attitudes contributing to political stability and economic&#13;
development   is   regarded  as   an   important  aspect   of   the&#13;
educational   system.   This   expansionary   rationale  is   again&#13;
concentrated mainly on primary schooling.&#13;
d)   Increased   educational   quality.    Increased   expenditures   on&#13;
education and changes in educational policy have on occasions&#13;
been directed towards an increase in quality rather than&#13;
quantity.   Policies  to gear   curricula   towards  more  national&#13;
concerns, to transfer control over examinations away from&#13;
ex-colonial powers, to upgrade teachers and improve other school&#13;
resources and to increase the research and planning capacity of&#13;
the Ministry of Education all come within this category.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
e)   Improved efficiency   Finally, plans have focused on the improved&#13;
use of existing resources and the organisatLon of schooling to&#13;
reducE wastage and increase the total number of graduates from&#13;
the system.&#13;
After categorising the expansionary rationales in this way, Lewin,&#13;
Little and Colclough then argue that trends over time in the importance of&#13;
each of these can be identified. Perhaps most important in the context of our&#13;
discussion  is that all    the plans reviewed   included a stress    on manpower&#13;
development.   The manpower development arguments however have continued       to&#13;
focus on the formal wage sector with little emphasis on the skill requirements&#13;
of the urban informal sector and the rural sector as a whole.           This has&#13;
resulted in (or coincided with) the manpower rationale being used mainly for&#13;
senior secondary and tertiary education and with an increasing emphasis on&#13;
science and technical subjects.&#13;
While the manpower development rationale remains the major one, the&#13;
importance of social equity and nationbuilding-shared value considerations&#13;
have grown in importance.   These have mainly concentrated on primary schooling&#13;
but as the latter becomes universal, the same arguments are being made for&#13;
junior secondary schooling.   Overall, it appears to be becoming more the case&#13;
that  the   rationales  for   expanding  the   lower  levels  of   education  are&#13;
differentiated from those for the higher levels.&#13;
In addition to the equity and nationbuilding rationales having&#13;
increased in importance, other emphases in educational plans have also begun&#13;
to restrict the dominance of the concern with purely enrollment expansion&#13;
dictated  by manpower   considerations.    These  emphases  have  been  aimed  at&#13;
increasing   efficiency  within   the   system  to   achieve  largely   pedagogic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
objectives and reduce dropout and repeater levels.      In recent years, stress&#13;
has been placed on curricula reform, increased teacher education and&#13;
in-service training and, even more recently, on the increased provision of&#13;
learning materials including textbooks.    Comparative studies of the levels of&#13;
learning for a given period of schooling in developed and developing countries&#13;
have   indicated   very   large  differences   (Heyneman   and   Loxley,   1983).&#13;
Encouragingly, those programs which have been aimed at increasing quality&#13;
through the provision of additional resources appear to be showing significant&#13;
results   (Schiefelbein,   Farrell,   Sepulveda-Stuardo,   1983).    While   this&#13;
increasing concern with school quality obviously has implications for manpower&#13;
development, the emphasis is not on increasing the number of people flowing&#13;
from school to work with a given 'qualification'.     It is more concerned with&#13;
increasing the levels of learning and achievement.&#13;
Even though not all education policy is based on considerations of&#13;
manpower development and even though, according to national education plans,&#13;
other rationales may be gaining in relative importance it is still the case&#13;
that such considerations dominate.    Further, while political and social goals&#13;
may have been accorded more weight in the 1970's, the increasingly difficult&#13;
economic and public finance environment likely to face the developing&#13;
countries through the 1980's can be expected to result in an increased concern&#13;
over the economic efficiency of educational expenditure.     This can be seen in&#13;
two ways - an increased preoccupation with external efficiency and the&#13;
relationship between school and work and, secondly, a greater concern that&#13;
whatever internal or external objectives are chosen for the education system,&#13;
they are achieved in the least cost way.      In the next section, therefore, a&#13;
brief look is taken at the methodologies which have been developed for&#13;
analysing the economic    implications of educational   projects.   A much more&#13;
developed discussion of this is included in the later chapters.&#13;

4.       TECHNIQUES FOR THE MANPOWER ANALYSIS OF EDUCATION PROJECTS&#13;
Two basic models and a number of variants have been developed for&#13;
guiding educational development in line with demands emanating from the labor&#13;
market. These are the manpower requirements model and the cost benefit (or&#13;
rate  of  return)  model..  The   forms  in which   both  are  applied  today  in&#13;
developing countries were basically developed by the mid 1960's.      Since then,&#13;
application of the manpower requirements model has spread across the countries&#13;
of Africa, Asia and Latin America and more or less become a requirement for&#13;
securing  budgetary   funds  and  international  agency   loans  for  educational&#13;
expansion.   The cost benefit approach on the other hand has rarely, if ever,&#13;
been   used  as   the  single   justification   for   education   projects.   For&#13;
practitioners involved in education and manpower planning it would appear, at&#13;
first sight, that the manpower requirements model has achieved widespread&#13;
credibility.&#13;
This apparent credibility of manpower requirement Eorecasting has&#13;
developed in the face of constant criticism over the last 15 years or so from,&#13;
in particular, academic economists.    This criticism has been made at both a&#13;
purely theoretical level and on the basis of empiricial evaluations of actual&#13;
forecasting exercises.   The model favored by most of these economists has been&#13;
the cost-benefit one, solidly grounded in the assumptions and theories of&#13;
neo-classical economics.   In the same way that practitioners have been little&#13;
influenced in their work by the theoretical arguments of their academic&#13;
counterparts, the response to the cost- benefit model by practitioners has had&#13;
little effect on the views of the academics.       The intuitive appeal of each&#13;
model is very strong, but. in obviously different ways.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
Much of the rest of this section contains arguments against the use&#13;
of the manpower requirements model as the single guideline for educational&#13;
planning.   These arguments are not made because we, and the other authors in&#13;
this volume, believe that this model is never applicable and should be totally&#13;
substituted  for by   the cost benefit    model.   That  there  are  problems   and&#13;
limitations to cost benefit analysis is also accepted.        The emphasis on the&#13;
criticism of using the manpower requirements approach is simply because it is&#13;
so dominant and is chosen as the only technique to analyse the manpower&#13;
implications of education projects in most developing countries.         Since the&#13;
theme of this and subsequent chapters is the need for a more eclectic approach&#13;
to the use of techniques and the substitution or complementation of technique&#13;
by a planning process, it is the monolithic position of the manpower&#13;
requirements approach which most needs to be addressed.&#13;
The two models have been extensively described and discussed over the&#13;
last two decades.    Here we comment on only a few of their essentials and the&#13;
major theoretical divergences.     The main emphasis, however,    is in examining&#13;
the problems of interpreting the results and the implications of these for&#13;
decision- making.    Some of the consequences of relying on a single model, in&#13;
this case the requirements model, to examine the implications of education&#13;
projects are also discussed.&#13;
Returning   to   terminology    introduced   above,   the   emphasis    of&#13;
educational planning models has mainly been on the external efficiency of the&#13;
school system in terms of linking graduates into the world of work.        The way&#13;
in which this efficiency is viewed and hence measured, however, differs&#13;
between models.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
According   to  the  manpower   requirements  approach,   the  gains&#13;
resulting from the expansion of education come from the ability&#13;
of   the  economy    to  achieve   certain   increased   levels   of&#13;
production.    Educational  projects  are  justified   in  terms  of&#13;
supplying skill requirements once production targets have been&#13;
decided upon. Without the production of these skills&#13;
it is argued that planned levels of output cannot be reached.&#13;
Education   targets   are   thus   linked   directly   to   specific&#13;
production targets.&#13;
According  to   the  cost  - benefit   approach,   efficiency  gains&#13;
result from educational expansion if the social benefits exceed&#13;
the social costs    (at an appropriate rate of discount).       This&#13;
approach is framed in terms of the relationship between the&#13;
costs of education and the resulting increased productivity of&#13;
graduates   in   whatever   economic   activity   they   work.    In&#13;
considering the further expansion of education it is argued that&#13;
if the rate of return is above the rate set as the criterion for&#13;
government investment, this can be interpreted as a signal to&#13;
expand, and if lower, as a signal against expansion or for&#13;
contraction.-&#13;
a)   The manpowar requirements approach&#13;
The point was made forcefully by Blaug as far back as 1967 that the&#13;
two approaches are based on very different judgements regarding how the labor&#13;
market operates in a marlcet economy (Blaug, 1967).     Emphasis came to be placed&#13;
on the centrality of substitution assumptions in each approach and in&#13;
particular on the potential for substituting one labor type for another.        Put&#13;
simply, the manpower requirements and cost - benefit approaches assume zero&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
and infinite substitution possibilities respectively.     In the late 1960's and&#13;
early 1970's a number of attempts were made to derive empirical estimates of&#13;
the degree of substitution.   While the data and methodologies used cannot be&#13;
said to have been beyond criticism enabling a definitive judgement to be made,&#13;
all  attempts   pointed   in  the  direction   of   implying  that   substitution&#13;
possibilities, while not being infinite, exist to a much greater extent than&#13;
is assumed in the manpower forecasting methodology.&#13;
Around this same time, the theoretical testing of the manpower&#13;
forecasting model was complemented by a series of now well-known evaluations&#13;
of forecasting in practice, the most widely quoted being Hollister's (1966)&#13;
work on the OECD's Mediterranean Regional Project, Jolly and Colclough's&#13;
(1972) review of manpower planning exercises in 20 African countries and the&#13;
collection of case studies from eight countries in Ahamad and Blaug (1973).&#13;
In all of these, judgements on the methodology and accuracy of manpower&#13;
forecasting were critical.   In addition, the OECD's major attempt in 1970 to&#13;
collate and analyse international data on education - occupation - economic&#13;
patterns in a search for some stable relationships which could be used in&#13;
planning concluded that such relationships did not exist        (OECD,  1970).  A&#13;
wide range of unexplained variations were described implying that a given&#13;
economic structure can co-exist with a number of occupational and educational&#13;
structures.&#13;
Since the early 1970's, the debate over manpower forecasting has seen&#13;
little movement. The critical bombardment appears to have had no effect on&#13;
practitioners' use of the approach and more and more countries have in fact&#13;
adopted  it.   In turn, many of the academics have       directed  their  efforts&#13;
elsewhere, either outside the subject into areas such as the 'new household&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
economics' or within it to detailed analyses of earnings determinants and&#13;
distributions.   However, a preliminary review of forecasting experience over&#13;
the last decade has recently been made by Debeauvais and Psacharopoulos&#13;
(1983).    After  commenting   on   the   increased   proliferation   of  manpower&#13;
forecasting, they argue that,&#13;
-    manpower plans   continue   to be   growth  oriented  and. few  integrate&#13;
objectives of Equity or social demand,&#13;
-    most plans   are  limited  to a concern with wage employment       in the&#13;
formal sector,&#13;
-    huge discrepancies exist between the actual rates of economic growth&#13;
and the assumed ones upon which the manpower forecasts are based,&#13;
-    occupational  mobility   is  seriously neglected   and  the  greater   the&#13;
mobility, the less accurate and useful the forecasts are,&#13;
-    countries at similar levels of economic development have experienced&#13;
diverse educational and occupational structures.&#13;
Again, such statements provide little support to the requirements&#13;
forecasting approach.    However, the methodology behind the forecasts involves&#13;
a number of discrete steps and it is, therefore, relevant to ask whether some&#13;
of these involve more stable relationships than others.      The answer appears to&#13;
be that the accuracy of occupational forecasting is greater than that of&#13;
educational forecasting and that greater accuracy is achieved at the industry&#13;
level than for the economy as a whole.      This implies that the best estimates&#13;
will be for single (and some groups of) occupations at the industry level and&#13;
vill be of use primarily in undiversified economies or in forecasting the&#13;
equirements for occupations involved in very few industries.         Again,  these&#13;
-indings are not encouraging for purposes of educational planning but they do&#13;
perhaps imply that the alternatives are not only limited to the acceptarice or&#13;
irejection of the requiremEnts model in its entirety.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
While   the  application  of   the  manpower   requirements  model   has&#13;
continued to spread, the impression is sometimes gained from those involved&#13;
that they are aware of all the criticisms which have been made and often&#13;
accept them. Indeed, individuals in manpower development units are sometimes&#13;
almost apologetic about this forecasting work.     These units, however, tend to&#13;
be dominated by the Central Planning Office or Ministry of Finance and these&#13;
bodies invariably require quantitative estimates for their development plans.&#13;
In these circumstances, manpower requirements forecasts are made not because&#13;
of a trust in the approach but because alternative approaches are considered&#13;
even less trustworthy or are methodologically more demanding.         Before any&#13;
alternative approaches for assessing education projects, and their problems in&#13;
providing a single framework for analysis, are briefly discussed it is useful&#13;
to list those aspects and objectives of education which are left out of the&#13;
requirements  approach.    The  headings  listed   in  section  3,  above,  which&#13;
summarise the preoccupations of national education plans over recent years&#13;
form a suitable framework:&#13;
Manpower   development   Even   if  occupational   requirements   are  accurately&#13;
forecast, the approach offers no guidance for selecting the ways in which&#13;
skills  are  formed.   Particularly  at  the  skilled manual   worker  level  the&#13;
alternatives of on-the-job training, firms' training courses and a range of&#13;
possible institutional modes exist. In addition, the approach does not itself&#13;
ask the question whether the cost of training people to meet certain targets&#13;
of increased production are worthwhile in economic terms.&#13;
Equity    The   requirements  approach   provides  no  framework   for  analysing&#13;
projects directed to increasing equality of access.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Nationbuilding     Again,   the   approach   gives  no   consideration   to   the&#13;
non-cognitive products of education.&#13;
Increased quality     In converting occupational    requirements  to educational&#13;
requirements,   the  forecasting  approach   necessarily  considers   educational&#13;
quality and the skills produced.      It does not   focus,  however,  on recently&#13;
posed questions such as the impact of additional textbooks, the upgrading of&#13;
teachers, and curriculum development on the level of learning and consequently&#13;
on productive performance.&#13;
Increased efficiency    Similarly while questions of dropouts and repeaters are&#13;
implicitly focused on by the approach -- since the levels of these affect the&#13;
reaching of targets--an assessment of measures to improve school performance&#13;
in these areas, and in others, such as by the use of double shifts, is not&#13;
covered.&#13;
The manpower requirements approach has been shown to suffer from&#13;
theoretical limitations and to have often produced inaccurate forecasts.&#13;
Although it is currently used in more countries than ever, the approach is&#13;
often viewed sceptically by practitioners and as the objectives of education&#13;
plans widen,   its focus  appears  increasingly narrow.    However,  because  the&#13;
debate  over  planning   techniques  has  been  largely   conducted  on  an  all-&#13;
or-nothing basis, adoption of the requirements approach has then tended to&#13;
rule out the search by practitioners for, and the adoption of, other&#13;
analytical approaches to at least use alongside it.    One such approach is cost&#13;
- benefit analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
b) The cost- benefit approach&#13;
In the following papers it is suggested that there are areas within&#13;
the sphere of educational planning where a cost-benefit framework is the most&#13;
applicable one. This is not to say that such a framework is regarded as being&#13;
capable of answering all questions or that forecasting exercises are in all&#13;
cases  inappropriate.    In addition,   while  it  is  in principle   capable  of&#13;
considering more of the rationales for educational development than is&#13;
manpower forecasting, it is not an appropriate appraisal tool for those&#13;
projects based on human rights, and nation building considerations.&#13;
As mentioned previously, the cost-benefit approach has had a strong&#13;
intuitive appeal among academic economists and what testing of the labor&#13;
market there has been appears to corroborate several assumptions of the&#13;
approach. Over the past twenty years, however, a long list of objections has&#13;
been directed at this approach as a basis for guiding decisions in education.&#13;
Among these are the equation of earnings differences with productivity&#13;
differences, the inability to show to what extent the higher earnings of the&#13;
higher educated are caused by that education, the narrow interpretation of&#13;
even the direct economic benefits of education, the lack of quantitative&#13;
solutions and the inability to be able to forecast and measure the benefits&#13;
over a lifetime.&#13;
This last point is of particular concern for interpreting rates of&#13;
return  for policy purposes.     What  is required   is a measure    of  lifetime&#13;
productivity   increases   resulting  directly   from  marginal   increments   in&#13;
educational   investment.   The  nearest   we  can   get  to  this   is  earnings&#13;
differentials derived from cross     sections  of the existing workforce.     The&#13;
procedure of using cross-sectional data means that a picture of the labor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
market is provided which reflects the current experience of graduates of all&#13;
ages.   It does not necessarily reflect the prospective experience of current&#13;
new graduates and is even more unlikely to be an accurate assessment of the&#13;
experience of graduates entering the labor market several years in the future&#13;
as a result of investment decisions made today.     What actually happens to the&#13;
earnings differentials between differently educated groups in the future will&#13;
depend on changes in both supply and demand.     That these might occur in ways&#13;
which result in the differential remaining unchanged woulld be a pure&#13;
coincidence.&#13;
In which direction are rates of return likely to move?        FoI a few&#13;
specific skills, demands in the short term may outrun supply and the returns&#13;
increase.   In most cases, however, the rate of growth of educational outputs&#13;
has tended to increase Easter than the rate of economic growtlh and over time&#13;
one can expect a downward pressure on differentials by educational level and&#13;
hence on rates of return. Evidence of several rate of return calculations for&#13;
the United States using cross sectional data at different points in time over&#13;
the last 40 years corroborate this expectation as do calculations made for&#13;
Colombia in the mid 1960's and mid 1970's, (Psacharopoulos, 1981, Tables 5 and&#13;
7).&#13;
Where this leaves us is that a low rate of return calculated in the&#13;
conventional way using cross sectional data cannot be expected to be an&#13;
underestimate  of   the  true  lifetime  return.    Therefore,  unless  there  is&#13;
evidence to suggest that wages are being artificially held down by the&#13;
government,  educational   expansion   is  not  justified   on  purely   economic&#13;
grounds.  When returns are high, further analysis of expected future supply&#13;
and demand and hence of changes in wages is both justified and required.     This&#13;
irgument suggests that if rate of return calculations are made they should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
only act as a first stage screen and that further analysis of the future&#13;
behavior of labor markets is then required.     This is not however the cue for&#13;
the  rehabilitation   of  manpower   requirements   forecasting.   As   Hollister&#13;
forcefully states in his conclusion, what is required is, "a program which&#13;
puts less emphasis on manpower forecasting and more emphasis on manpower&#13;
analysis of the operation of various aspects of the labor market at all skill&#13;
levels." The nature of this analysis is the concern of the remnaining part of&#13;
this chapter and other chapters in this volume.&#13;
5. FROM PLANNING TECHNIQUE TO PLANNING PROCESS&#13;
Shifts in the importance given to the various rationales for&#13;
educational development outlined in section 3, above, add additional weight to&#13;
the argument that neither of the two main competing analytical frameworks can&#13;
encompass the whole range of planning issues and that within government&#13;
manpower development agencies, a more diversified approach is required.        The&#13;
changing distribution of lending also suggests that a wider approach to&#13;
project appraisals   is required within development assistance agencies.      Two&#13;
significant changes have recently occurred in lending patterns.       First, more&#13;
and more projects are including the provision of classroom materials and&#13;
in-service teacher training which reflect an increased concern with school&#13;
quality.   Second, the proportion of loans devoted to primary schooling has&#13;
increased significantly    - for the World Bank from only 5 per cent between&#13;
1970-74 to 24 per cent between 1979-83.      In addition to   lending increasing&#13;
faster in those areas least amenable to manpower requirements analysis there&#13;
is another reason for shifting emphasis away from approaches which attempt to&#13;
judge whether or not an expansion is justified in pure manpower terms.       This&#13;
is that, in practice, such proposals which originate within governments are&#13;
very rarely rejected for funding.    Consequently it may be more productive for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
manpower/educational   planners  to  spend  time   in  other  areas  than  making&#13;
manpower forecasts or fully fledged cost-benefit calculations.        Such areas&#13;
would include a major concern with internal efficiency, cost-effective- ness,&#13;
rationalisation of competing training modes, subject or curriculum bias&#13;
balance, teaching effectiveness, the timing of irrevocable decisions on&#13;
specialisation and, in general, in adding an analytical input and direction to&#13;
government decisionmaking.    While international agency staff cannot possibly&#13;
participate as equals in all discussions with government personnel on these&#13;
issues, their experiences with different educational technologies across&#13;
countries suggests that in the area of formal cost- effectiveness analysis of&#13;
such technologies, they have a clear advantage.&#13;
These changes in the composition of educational loans also reflect&#13;
similar changes in education spending as a whole.     Because of this, plus the&#13;
need to replace the requirements approach in several of the areas in which it&#13;
is now used, an increased range of techniques and analyses are required within&#13;
manpower development units.    These are spelled out in greater detail in the&#13;
other  papers   but  include:   more  concentration   on  cost-effectiveness,   a&#13;
comprehensive developmenl: of tracer studies and their results linked back to&#13;
costs, careful development and use of labor turnover and vacancy surveys,&#13;
analyses  of  wage   structures  and   movements,   studies  of   the  impact  of&#13;
alternative financing arrangements on access and take-up, clevelopment of&#13;
methods and procedures to improve employer expectations surveys, and studies&#13;
of the impact on schooling achievement of additional resources or changes in&#13;
their composition.&#13;
The adoption of a wide range of techniques and analyses to replace a&#13;
single, internally consistent approach, however, requires another form of&#13;
discipline.   That discipline,   it is argued throughout the chapters in this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
volume,   can   be   provided   through   administrative   procedures   and   the&#13;
formalisation of tasks which together can comprise a consistent planning&#13;
process.&#13;
Both Dougherty and Hollister produced their papers as a result of&#13;
spending a period of time attached to a manpower development unit in a&#13;
developing country.   While both are academics these experiences led them to&#13;
judge  the   educational   planning  literature   from  the   viewpoint   of  the&#13;
practitioner.   Quite obviously, they found it left much to be desired.     Their&#13;
views are summarised below.&#13;
Dougherty's paper begins with a consideration of the experiences of&#13;
development planning in general. Three points are put forward:&#13;
Gains from increases in organisational efficiency have been at least&#13;
as great as those resulting from the application of formal analysis.&#13;
It  is   naive   to  separate   the  choice   of   technique  from   the&#13;
institutional arrangements since the way in which decisions are made&#13;
affects their operationality.&#13;
Many development projects do not lend themselves to formal methods of&#13;
project appraisal.&#13;
One   implication   of   these   experiences   for   planning   manpower&#13;
development in developing countries is that while the value of qualitative&#13;
forecasting or rate of return analysis for guiding manpower developing&#13;
planning should not be underrated, it is unrealistic to believe that either&#13;
singly or jointly they can cover the whole sector.     As a consequence of this,&#13;
it is argued that a manpower development unit should be primarily concerned&#13;
with providing information and designing procedures to help ensure that&#13;
decisionmaking carried out by the numerous agencies involved is rational in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
the  sense   of  being  consistent   with   predetermined  economic,   social   and&#13;
political criteria.   In the rest of his chapter Dougherty attempts to show how&#13;
this might be done.&#13;
Essentially, since in his view an operational theoretical approach to&#13;
manpower planning does not exist, a unifying framework for analysis and&#13;
policymaking requires the construction and repetition of what is termed an&#13;
"annual  routine."    Such  a  routine   results  in   learning  from  experience,&#13;
economises on decisioninaking and initiative, prevents necessary activities&#13;
being crowded out by acl hoc crises and maintains continuity of focus in the&#13;
face of staff changes.      While  a definitive   list of   tasks  for  the annual&#13;
routine is not included, since it is obvious that many of these will vary by&#13;
country, some suggestions are made.     These are grouped around the headings of&#13;
administrative   capacity,   information   flows,   efficient   use   of   existing&#13;
resources, enrollment policy, and, other policy issues. Each task is executed&#13;
at a specific date during the year.&#13;
Turning to a consideration of lending agencies, the point is directly&#13;
made that the development of Borrowers' planning capacity should be the single&#13;
most important objective.     The adoption of an annual routine,     however, will&#13;
have  two consequences    for the  Lender.    First,  there will   be  a necessary&#13;
downplaying of formal analysis and second, the concentration on continuous&#13;
programming may conflict with the discreet project approach adopted by lending&#13;
agencies.&#13;
Dougherty concludes that the effective management and planning of the&#13;
manpower development sector is conditional on the existence of a centralised&#13;
co-ordinating agency involved in a continuous planning process plus the&#13;
increased use of cost-effectiveness analysis.&#13;
The concerns of Hollister's chapter can succintly be described as&#13;
follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
The practice of manpower planning in developing countries has not&#13;
significantly   changed   over   the   last   20   years   and   remains&#13;
unsatisfactory.&#13;
The claims of accuracy made by manpower      forecasters have relieved&#13;
educators from a feeling of responsibility for the graduates of their&#13;
programs.&#13;
There has been a misallocation of effort by manpower development&#13;
agency staff in favor of method as opposed to attempts to improve&#13;
flows of information and to understand how labor markets actually&#13;
function.&#13;
The underlying rationale for manpower planning is said to be the&#13;
avoidance of labor    surpluses  and  shortages.   This  should  lead naturally,&#13;
according to Hollister,   to a consideration of the nature of labor markets&#13;
since the choice of manpower planning activities requires a conception of how&#13;
these markets   operate.   Without   going  into  detail  in  this  summary,  the&#13;
argument is made that, particularly in the private sector, the labor market in&#13;
developing countries is largely characterized by flexibility.&#13;
Behind   the  formulation   of  more   appropriate   manpower   planning&#13;
activities which is the basic concern of Hollister's chapter are three key&#13;
statements:&#13;
Skill shortages and surpluses are only critical when the gestation&#13;
period for the formation of a skill is lengthy.&#13;
The majority of people with such skills are typically employed in the&#13;
public sector.&#13;
International experience indicates that attempts to forecast manpower&#13;
requirements are not likely to be very successful.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
On the basis of the first two of these, he argues that since the&#13;
gestation period for the majority of labor groups is short and since the&#13;
majority of those who do require lengthy training are employed by the public&#13;
sector where employment: patterns are determined more by specific public policy&#13;
and institutional organization than by expected changes in economic structure,&#13;
economy wide manpower forecasting is largely unnecessary.      The third element&#13;
argues that in those cases where training periods are lengthy and such&#13;
forecasts might be useful, on the basis of past experience they cannot be&#13;
expected to be very accurate.&#13;
The alternatives for manpower analysis which Hollister suggests&#13;
appear, as he admits:, "various, scattered, difficult to implement and,&#13;
perhaps, even ad hoc."    Within an organisational framework such as the one&#13;
suggested by Dougherty, however, they are seen to be capable of generating the&#13;
most useful forms of inEormation.    Much of the rest of the chapter is devoted&#13;
to a discussion of the labor market characteristics of high, middle and low&#13;
level manpower in the private and public sectors and the various types of&#13;
analyses which are seen as being the most appropriate for the purposes of&#13;
increasing labor market efficiency.     These analyses require the maintenance&#13;
and utilisation of regularly collected time series data.      Discussion of this&#13;
is then presented. In i:he final section, Hollister turns to t:he role of the&#13;
development assistance agencies.   Here he sees the priorities as assistance in&#13;
evaluation, data improvement and the methodological refinement of tracer&#13;
studies, wage and labor turnover data.&#13;
The authors of this volume argue that there are severe limitations to&#13;
the practicability and usefulness of both manpower forecasting and rate of&#13;
return analysis for determining, alone, the optimum pattern of educational&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

investment. This leads to the view that no single approach to the economic&#13;
analysis of education projects should dominate and be used comprehensively.&#13;
The alternative is a wider use of approaches, but within a well ordered&#13;
administrative framework such as the one described in the following chapter.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
In recent years there has been a gradual change of emphasis in&#13;
planning theory.   It is being increasingly accepted that planning is a process&#13;
and that its effectiveness depends as much on the form of this process as on&#13;
individual modes of analysis.&#13;
Twenty years ago the possibility of using cybernetic processes for&#13;
planning purposes seemted very attractive to economists who had been exposed to&#13;
engineering   mathematics.    The   design   of   countercyclical   macroeconomic&#13;
stabilization policies was an initial fairly modest application.       Later, the&#13;
spectacular success of the use of feedback control in the NASA space programme&#13;
provided inspiration for the construction of elaborate computer models which&#13;
used sophisticated routines for the design of optimal policy.&#13;
Useful though these models may have been for organizing thought and&#13;
for academic teaching, none has ever had any practical value for the purposes&#13;
of economic   planning.   Economic  problems  are  far more complex than those&#13;
encountered in engineering and are correspondingly less amenable to this type&#13;
of approach.   Eventually most of those involved in building such models came&#13;
to feel that their time could be better used elsewhere, and, in the reaction&#13;
that followed, terms like cybernetic acquired a pejorative association and&#13;
were discarded from the economist's vocabulary.&#13;
This experience had the extremely damaging consequence of inhibiting&#13;
the exploration of the extent to which cybernetic principles could in some&#13;
other  form be applied    to economic  planning.    In the context   of manpower&#13;
development planning, rate of return analysis is all that has survived, and&#13;
its application has been sporadic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
However there are signs that a reformulated cybernetic approach to&#13;
planning  is   beginning  to   emerge.l/   Since  no   clear  statement   of  its&#13;
application to the manpower development sector as yet exists, the following&#13;
outline is as much advocative as descriptive. 2/&#13;
a.   The notion that a formal mechanistic model could provide a useful&#13;
framework must be wholly abandoned.    Tne sprawling diversity of the&#13;
manpower development sector calls for an approach which is flexible&#13;
in technique and highly disaggregated in application.&#13;
b.   An extremely eclectic variety of types of feedback may be employed.&#13;
Prominent among them may be quantity signals derived from the&#13;
traditional   manpower   requirements   approach,   or   price   signals&#13;
expressed in the form of rate of return analysis, but in addition a&#13;
wide variety of other types of labor market information, qualitative&#13;
as well as quantitative, may be employed.&#13;
c.   Some  of this   feedback will   be monitored   and responded   to by   a&#13;
centralized government planning agency, which will be described as&#13;
the Manpower Development Planning Unit (MDPU), but much will pass&#13;
directly between the main actors interested in manpower development:&#13;
1/ For economic planning in developing countries the watershed was reached&#13;
with Faber and Seers (1973), the essays by Seers, Leys and Waterston being&#13;
particularly influential. However, most of the running in recent planning&#13;
theory has been made by other disciples, especially Social Administration,&#13;
Regional and Urban Planning, and Operations Research.       Contributions to&#13;
their literature tend either to be very abstract or so specific that they&#13;
are of little value outside their original application, but some, notably&#13;
Faludi (1973) and Friend, Power and Yewlett (1974), are relevant to&#13;
economic management.&#13;
2/ It owes much to discussions with R.G. Hollister and M.J. Selowsky.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

institutions responsible for education and training, individuals&#13;
considering enrolling in their courses, planning agencies and&#13;
employers.   A major objective of the I4DPU will be to develop these&#13;
flows   of   information   witlh  the   aim    of   prornoting  rational,&#13;
decentralized decision-making and thereby reducing the need for&#13;
direct intervention by itself.&#13;
d.   The MDPU will    seek  to attain   its  objectives  by collaboration    or&#13;
delegation  rather   than  command.   One  main   function will   be   the&#13;
systematic   and  regular   assessment  and   transmission   of  feedback&#13;
signals   to  other   institutions.    Another  will   be   checking   the&#13;
effectiveness    of   institutional   arrangements    and(  channels    of&#13;
communication.&#13;
e.   These function; will involve the repetition at regular intervals of a&#13;
large number of heterogeneous activities.      To ensure that they are&#13;
executed   systematically,   it   will  be   necessary   to   impose   the&#13;
discipline of a formal schedule such as an annual routine.&#13;
f.   In as far as t:he policies of the MDPU are determined by economic,&#13;
rather than social, cultural or political, considerations, the&#13;
optimal use of resources will be its guiding principle, and rate of&#13;
return and cost-effectiveness analysis the preferred form.       However,&#13;
except for a few special cases, its decisions will, be based on&#13;
informed conviction rather than formal analysis, and when formal&#13;
analysis   is   undertaken,   it  may   utilize   other   techniques   as&#13;
appropriate.&#13;
These points will be discussed in Section 2.      Sections 3 and 4 will&#13;
i:race the implications in general terms for Technical Assistance Agencies like&#13;
I:he International Labour Office and for Lending Agencies like the World Bank.&#13;
';ection 5 presents conclusions and recommendations.&#13;

2.       THE BORROWER:  A CONTINUOUS-PROCESS APPROACH&#13;
TO MAMNPOWER PLANNING.&#13;
This section describes the role of a borrowing country's MDPU in some&#13;
detail, both because this is necessary for the discussion of Borrower manpower&#13;
development   planning  techniques   and,   equally   importantly,  because   the&#13;
difficulties encountered by Lending Agencies in formulating their own criteria&#13;
originate in large measure in the failure of the typical MDPU to discharge its&#13;
functions satisfactorily.&#13;
It is probably fair to say that the typical MDPU, even when located&#13;
in an otherwise powerful and effective National Planning Department, is a&#13;
marginalized institution with little or no systematic influence on manpower&#13;
development strategy.&#13;
There are several possible reasons for this. First, the MDPU may not&#13;
have assumed responsibility for a systematic manpower development strategy.&#13;
Either institutional arrangements do not allow it to assume such a function,&#13;
or those responsible for establishing it or supervising it have not included&#13;
this function among its designated activities.&#13;
Second, where the MDPU has assumed responsibility for a manpower&#13;
development strategy, it may be discharging it in such a way as to have no&#13;
practical effect.   Again, there are a number of reasons why this may be the&#13;
case.   It may be because     its  analysis  is of no   practical  value  to  the&#13;
institutions responsible for manpower development. It may be because it lacks&#13;
the  power   to  influeence   these   institutions.   It   may  be   because  the&#13;
institutional links for translating its analysis into operating decisions do&#13;
not exist or have withered away.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
(i)      The need for a continuous-process approach&#13;
The  literature   on  manpower  development   planning  has  not   given&#13;
adequate attention to the role of the MDPU in promoting organizational&#13;
efficiency  in  the  manpower   development  sector.   There  appears  to  be  an&#13;
implicit   assumption  that   manpower   development   planners  should   confine&#13;
themselves to deriving criteria for determining enrolments, and that such&#13;
institutional issues c!s the development of new institutional arrangements and&#13;
the maintenance of effectiveness of existing ones should be allowed to take&#13;
care of themselves or be subcontracted to specialists in other fields.&#13;
However, one of the main lessons of the evaluaticon of development&#13;
planning experience that has taken place over the last decade is that, even if&#13;
one is narrowly concerned with economic efficiency, the gains that can be made&#13;
from promoting organizational efficiency may be as important as those that&#13;
accrue from the application of formal analysis to objectives.        3/   This  is&#13;
certainly  the case   in the manpower development     sector in many developing&#13;
countries.&#13;
A second lesson is that it may be naive to attempt to separate the&#13;
choice of analytical technique from a consideration of institutional&#13;
arrangements, since the processes by which decisions are made and implemented&#13;
may have a bearing on what kind of decisions are operational.      Again, this is&#13;
particularly the case in the manpower development sector, where the MDPU&#13;
cannot hope to be more than a partner in a decision-making process, regardless&#13;
of the formal powers at its disposition.&#13;
3/ For a detailed argument along these lines and a description of&#13;
organizational planning reform in Papua New Guinea, see Allan and&#13;
Hinchliffe (1982).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
The manpower development planning literatue has also neglected the&#13;
question of how to devise a manpower policy for those occupations whose demand&#13;
is not susceptible to formal analysis. While it would be foolish to underrate&#13;
the value of quantitative forecasting or rate of return analysis as&#13;
alternative, not necessarily mutually exclusive, types of feedback for guiding&#13;
manpower development planning, it would be equally unrealistic to suppose that&#13;
either singly or jointly they can cover the whole sector.&#13;
Although its most committed proponents may disagree, quantitative&#13;
forecasting has been of most value for those occupations whose demand may be&#13;
related to demographic, social or political norms, such as school teachers,&#13;
doctors,  nurses   and  police.   Efforts  to   forecast  the  demand  for  other&#13;
occupations have been undermined by a poverty of data, the difficulity of&#13;
allowing for the different types of substitution that affect employment, and&#13;
the heterogeneity of the different types of manpower.        Such forecasts have&#13;
either been insufficiently disaggregated or too sensitive to questionable&#13;
assumptions, or both, to be of value for guiding the enrollment policies of&#13;
manpower development institutions.&#13;
Similarly, a poverty of data and uncertainty about the future limit&#13;
the scope for applying rate of return analysis. Although few would be opposed&#13;
in principle to its use as an economic criterion, in practice it has been&#13;
confined  to   high-volume  types  of   manpower  development   such  as  primary&#13;
education, the major branches of secondary education, and some professions and&#13;
trades.   While its potential scope remains unexplored because little effort&#13;
has been made to incorporate it systematically in policymaking, it is safe to&#13;
say that most of its proponents would agree that for many types of manpower&#13;
development it should at least be accompanied by other types of evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
These   consiiderations   have   two   interrelated    implications   of&#13;
fundamental importance.,&#13;
First, a mechanistic approach to planning the manpower development&#13;
sector is wholly inappropriate.   Instead the MDPU should view the inst:itutions&#13;
responsible  for manpower   development   or  employment  as  forming  a complex&#13;
organism.   It will be concerned to ensure that the components of the organism&#13;
are functioning effectively and that the processes which link them are&#13;
operating as intended.    The chief modes of operation of the MDPU will be&#13;
delegation, collaboration and monitoring, rather than command, both because it&#13;
has little effective control over other institutions and because it lacks the&#13;
resources and expertise to give detailed guidance.       The MDPU will therefore&#13;
have to design with especial care its transactions with other institutions in&#13;
the  sector.    This  is  essential   for  ensuring  that   policy  analysis  and&#13;
decision-making take proper account of the way in which MDPUL decisions are&#13;
translated into operating decisions and implemented.&#13;
Second,  the   MDPU  will  be   primarily  concerned   to  ensure   that&#13;
decision-making   within  the  sector   is  rational,  in   the  sense  of  being&#13;
consistent with economic, social and political criteria, and of meeting them&#13;
as effectively as possible.     Because the traditional types of analysis are&#13;
subject to large margins of error and because the newer forms do not pretend&#13;
to  yield  measurable   indicators,  and  because  several   different  types  of&#13;
analysis may be applied in the same context, manpower development planning&#13;
decisions will usually be taken on the basis of informed conviction rather&#13;
l:han  directly  in   response   to   formal   analysis.    Regardless  of   what&#13;
niethodologists may say, those actually involved in the preparation and&#13;
appraisal of manpower development projects will confirm that this is a fact,&#13;
and that the use of formal analysis for project justification is frequently&#13;
m-Nrely cosmetic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
Obviously the nature of the informed conviction will depend upon the&#13;
context and the skill of the decision-maker.       For many types of decision,&#13;
nothing more than common sense is required.      For others, particularly those&#13;
which involve simultaneous relationships, the operation of markets, or&#13;
considerations of opportunity cost, a proper training in economics may be&#13;
essential. Some decisions may be uncontroversial, but others which have to be&#13;
made without adequate data may not.      The objective of the MDPU will be to&#13;
ensure that lack of data and other constraints do not prevent decision-making&#13;
from being as good and timely as possible.&#13;
(ii)     The need for an annual routine&#13;
An organic orientation can only be effective if the MDPU monitors the&#13;
activities of collaborating institutions comprehensively and regularly.         In&#13;
view of the poverty of information it is inevitable that manpower development&#13;
decisions will prove to be in need of constant revision, and the more quickly&#13;
and systematically this revision takes place, the less will be the waste of&#13;
resources. This process of revision and adjustment is of course the heart of&#13;
a cybernetic approach.&#13;
Since many operating decisions within the manpower development sector&#13;
are taken on an annual basis, it will be natural for the monitoring tasks to&#13;
fall into a cycle of this length, and in what follows this cycle will be&#13;
termed the annual routine.    It should be noted, however, that some tasks may&#13;
need to be repeated at longer or shorter intervals than one year.&#13;
The establishment of an effective annual routine will be important&#13;
for several other reasons.    First, it will provide a disciplinary framework&#13;
for the activities of the MDPU.     If an operational theoretical approach had&#13;
existed, this might have provided the unifying framework for articulating&#13;
analysis and policy-making.   Since such a framework does not exist, some other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
means has to be found for organizing the activities of the MDPU, and the&#13;
annual routine will help to ensure that its responsibilities are discharged in&#13;
a regular and orderly manner.&#13;
Second, the repetition of a well-defined set of tasks on a regular&#13;
basis provides a means by which the MDPU may learn from experience and acquire&#13;
general knowledge of the manpower development sector upon which its informed&#13;
conviction must be based. In addition, the repetition of the tasks will give&#13;
it an opportunity l:o implement this learning by introducing piecemeal&#13;
improvements.&#13;
Third, an anuual routine economizes on decision-making and initiative&#13;
by making it unnecessary for the MDPU to design its program from scratch each&#13;
year.&#13;
Fourth, the establishment of a formal annual routine will help to&#13;
protect the constituent activities which though important may not at any given&#13;
time seem to be urgent, from being crowded out by the ad hoc activities that&#13;
also form part of the duties of the MDPU.&#13;
Fifth, it maintains continuity in the operations of the MDPU,&#13;
protects it from the erosion of institutional capital when staff members&#13;
leave, and provides a t:raining guide for new staff.&#13;
Most non-planning institutions possess an annual routine and indeed&#13;
would collapse into chaos if they did not.      Paradoxically, planning agencies&#13;
tend not to be subject to this discipline, a possible explanation being a&#13;
preoccupation with ad hoc projects and the medium or long term framework that&#13;
dominated the early plEanning literature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
(iii)    The composition of the annual routine&#13;
The opportunities for constructive intervention by the MDPU will be&#13;
as manifold and heterogeneous as the institutions and processes that comprise&#13;
the manpower   development  sector.    It  is  therefore  not  easy  to  classify&#13;
systematically   the  tasks  that  will   form  the  annual  routine.    However,&#13;
important categories will be:&#13;
a. Tasks designed to improve the administrative capacity of decision-making&#13;
units in the manpower development sector.&#13;
b.  Tasks designed to improve information flows within the sector.&#13;
c. Tasks designed to promote the efficient use of resources within the sector.&#13;
d.  Tasks   designed  to  guide   enrollment   policy  of  manpower   development&#13;
institutions.&#13;
e. Tasks relating to other policy issues.&#13;
Although the manpower development literature has focussed on analysis&#13;
which would be classified under the third or fourth headings, in many&#13;
countries the gains made under the first two may be both more substantial and&#13;
more  immediate.    It  is  not  unusual  to  find  large  parts  of  the  sector&#13;
administratively derelict, and it need hardly be said that this must be&#13;
rectified if rational decision-making and effective partnership are to be&#13;
possible.   Furthermore, the promotion of administrative competence is not a&#13;
once-and-for-all  task.   Although   some  institutions  in  the  sector  may  be&#13;
capable of adapting expeditiously to circumstances as they change, this is&#13;
unlikely to be true for all, and in any case should not be taken for granted.&#13;
While the MDPU may find that the proportion of its energy which needs to be&#13;
devoted to such tasks diminishes as progress is made, it will always need at&#13;
least to monitor this aspect of the health of the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
Similarly, there may be very great scope initialLy for improving&#13;
information flows, both creating new sources of information and rehabilitating&#13;
existing channels of communication that have wasted away.     The objectives will&#13;
be  to improve   the operation   of markets   and  to  improve  the  response  of&#13;
institutions in the sector to economic, social and political stimuli.       These&#13;
tasks also should become less demanding as time goes by.&#13;
This is not the place to attempt to give a comprehensive list: of the&#13;
tasks that might form an annual routine.       The examples outlined below are&#13;
intended only to illustrate its wide-ranging character.&#13;
(iv)     Tasks relating to administration&#13;
The MDPU needs to ensure that the record-keeping of major manpower&#13;
development institutions and certification bodies is systemat:ic and timely.&#13;
Manpower development institutions will at least have to prcovide data on&#13;
enrollments and graduatEs by type of course, teachers by qualification, age&#13;
and geographical location, and current and capital expenditure.     Certification&#13;
bodies will provide data on numbers of candidates by test result.&#13;
In some countries professional institutes are responsible not only&#13;
for granting qualifications but also for maintaining a register of practising&#13;
nembers.  This can be a very useful source of stock data for occupations with&#13;
:;ubstantial employment in the private sector.      The MDPU may wish     to give&#13;
-egistration legal force:, requiring membership to be renewed annually, and&#13;
::ncreasing the amount of information requested at renewal.&#13;
The MDPU needs to ensure that effective planning offices exist in the&#13;
major   manpower  development   institutions,   particularly   the   Ministry   of&#13;
Education, the universities and the Ministry of Labour if the latter is&#13;
responsible for a significant amount of industrial training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
An especially important example of an administrative task for the&#13;
MDPU is the monitoring of forward planning by the Ministry of Education&#13;
Planning Unit (MEPU).    In those countries with reliable population estimates&#13;
the MEPU should be in a position to prepare medium term projections of&#13;
enrollment in primary education and the major branches of secondary education,&#13;
making appropriate assumptions about drop-out and repetition rates and the&#13;
proportions   entering  different   branches  of   secondary  education.    As  a&#13;
corollary, using assumptions about student-teacher ratios, it should be able&#13;
to derive projections of teacher requirements by qualification.      Although in&#13;
principle such calculations can be executed manually, it is generally much&#13;
more convenient to construct a computerized accounting model for the purpose.&#13;
Teacher wastage should be estimated from stock data and hence&#13;
estimates  of  net  requirements   obtained.   Again,  the  calculations  may  be&#13;
executed more efficiently if the payroll of school staff is computerized.       If&#13;
conditions   warrant,   the  MDPU   may   wish   to  encourage   both   types   of&#13;
computerization, bearing in mind that although the software for each is by now&#13;
standard and readily available, a substantial investment in technical&#13;
expertise must be made at the time of introduction in three major respects:&#13;
the adaptation of the software to local conditions, the training of staff to&#13;
operate the system, and the adaptation of data collection.&#13;
Since these tasks need to be executed only once, supervision of the&#13;
introduction of computerization in the MEPU should be regarded as an ad hoc&#13;
project rather than part of the annual routine of the MDPU.&#13;
Supervision of the use of these systems, however, constitutes an&#13;
important part of the annual routine. Representatives of the MDPU should have&#13;
one or more meetings each year to ensure that the accounting system and&#13;
projections have been updated since the previous year and the results&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
translated into an updating projection of teacher requirement:s.    The MDPU will&#13;
examine both the key inputs - school data generation, projection of the school&#13;
age population, and assumptions concerning future class sizes, promotion rates&#13;
and repetition rates -- and the output in the form of an analysis of teacher&#13;
stock requirements.&#13;
The MDPU shoiuld also ensure that the teacher-training projections&#13;
have been updated.   Key inputs here are the projection of the required teacher&#13;
stock, data on the existing teacher stock gathered from t:he payroll, and&#13;
assumptions concerning the rates of wastage and return of female teachers&#13;
after   raising  families.    The  output   is  a   suitable  analysis   and  the&#13;
presentation of the results for giving specific guidance to teacher-training&#13;
institutes.&#13;
The MDPU will also be concerned to ensure that the personnel offices&#13;
of major employers are properly organized for the recruitment of manpower.&#13;
The largest employers may be encouraged to utilize company manpower planning&#13;
techniques designed to balance the internal supply and demand for positions of&#13;
responsibility and provide    orderly  career  structures.   Since  the MDPU   is&#13;
unlikely to have the resources or expertise to provide such assistance itself,&#13;
it should promote the establishment of a specialized institute for the purpose&#13;
for the public sector, a-ad possibly a counterpart for the privat:e sector.&#13;
In-service training is another area where the MDPU may be able to&#13;
make a contribution to administrative efficiency.     Such is the dispersion and&#13;
variety  of  this   important  category  of  manpower   development  that  it  is&#13;
extremely unlikely that the MDPU will be able to monitor it directly to any&#13;
great extent, never mind make quantitative recommendations concerning the&#13;
extent of its provision, but it may be able to play a positive role in its&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
institutional arrangements.    First, there will be the question of whether a&#13;
given type of training should be offered by a specialized agency or undertaken&#13;
by the firms themselves, either independently or on a group basis.        Second,&#13;
there will be the question of how to fund such schemes and how to provide&#13;
incentives for training to be undertaken on an appropriate scale.        The MDPU&#13;
may be able to make an initiative in consultation with the corresponding&#13;
Employers' Federation, the largest individual employers and the Planning&#13;
Office of the Ministry of Labour.&#13;
(v) Tasks relating to information&#13;
No matter how well organized and well staffed it is, the MDPU can be&#13;
responsible for only a small proportion of the decisions affecting manpower&#13;
development. Since the decision-making of those participating in training and&#13;
labor markets offers an alternative to its own efforts, it is in the interest&#13;
of the MDPU to promote efficiency in the operation of these markets and in&#13;
particular to improve the information available.      Indeed, it is fair to say&#13;
that an MDPU which fails to take advantage of autonomous decision-making is&#13;
likely to be overwhelmed by its task and to have very restricted practical&#13;
influence.&#13;
There are two major problems.    First, human capital is an investment&#13;
good and markets in investment goods are notoriously difficult to regulate.&#13;
Second, the decision to undertake investment is in general made by two&#13;
separate entities, the manpower development institution and the individual&#13;
undergoing education or training.&#13;
Typically official labor market statistics are of limited value for&#13;
decision-making. Relative wage rates and overtime rates are not disaggregated&#13;
in sufficient occupational detail or by skill level within an occupation, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
the unemployment and vacancy data published by the Employment Service of the&#13;
Ministry of Labour are further undermined by partial coverage.          Hence the&#13;
subjective evaluations by key informants of the current state of the market&#13;
for an occupation and its likely future prospects may also have a useful role&#13;
to play, making up in balance and perspective what they lack in e!mpiricism.&#13;
4/   The assessment of prospects may well      turn out to be    inaccurate,  but&#13;
nevertheless may be as valuable as any other information given lack of data&#13;
and  uncertainty  about   the  future.   Typical  key  informants  would  be  the&#13;
officers of the Ministry of Labour Employment Service and personnel. managers&#13;
of representative employers.    For all except high level manpower, collection&#13;
and publication of assessments should be undertaken on a regional basis.&#13;
In many countries surprisingly little attention is given to providing&#13;
information for the benefit of the individual.         Since assessments   of key&#13;
informants published in the usual official organs are likely to reach a very&#13;
restricted readership, it would probably be advantageous to seek republication&#13;
in the newspapers, say on an annual basis at a time when educational (lecisions&#13;
are being made.&#13;
The MDPU can play a useful role in stimulating the collection and&#13;
publication of such data by one or more centralized agencies, say the Ministry&#13;
of Education's Scholarships Department for formal education and the Ministry&#13;
of Labour for industrial, training.&#13;
The  MDPU   may   also   consider   encouraging   manpower   development&#13;
institutions to conduct tracer studies on its graduates, but if it does, it&#13;
should take steps to overcome the problems associated with them., They tend to&#13;

to date, see Richter (1982).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
be costly in terms of the information collected, their impact tends to be&#13;
undermined by restricted circulation of the results, cumbersome presentation&#13;
and delays between survey and publication, and they are usually conducted as a&#13;
one-off undertaking which is difficult to fit into an annual routine and&#13;
becomes quickly out-dated. There are also problems in the interpretation of&#13;
the findings, for which there is no well-defined methodology.&#13;
For those types of manpower where there are relatively few manpower&#13;
development institutions and employers, the MDPU may wish to encourage direct&#13;
communication between   the two groups.    Employers may be    in a position   to&#13;
provide short-term quantitative forecasts of requirements and they should also&#13;
be  able  to give   guidance  on curriculum   development.   It  is  common,   for&#13;
example, for employers to be represented on advisory or even governing boards&#13;
of institutions responsible for the development of high-level manpower, but&#13;
such arrangements tend to become moribund unless an active policy is adopted&#13;
to prevent this.&#13;
A further category of information which may be of especial use to the&#13;
MDPU and should not be overlooked are the ad hoc studies undertaken by the&#13;
universities, research institutes, employers' federations and other bodies.&#13;
The MDPU should collect such studies on a systematic basis and publicize their&#13;
existence.&#13;
In  general   the  MDPU   should  avoid  a   Mercantilist  approach   to&#13;
information and promote the institutionalization of flows rather than the&#13;
acquisition of stocks.    In particular, the establishment of a Manpower Data&#13;
Bank, which tends to be very expensive to maintain, should be resisted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
(vi)     Tasks relating to the-use of resources&#13;
Under this heading comes the monitoring of current and capital costs&#13;
per student and other indicators of resource utilization.       Simple trends in&#13;
themselves do not necessarily indicate changes in efficiency since they may&#13;
also   reflect  changes   in  quality.    For   example,  a   reduction   in  the&#13;
student-teacher ratio might indicate a less intensive use of teachers, but it&#13;
may also be the result of smaller class sizes. Accordingly, the production of&#13;
statistical data by manpower development institutions should be the starting&#13;
point of their contribution in this respect, and it is the responsibility of&#13;
the MDPU to ensure that they are accompanied by a plausible interpretation.&#13;
(vii)    Tasks relating to enrollment guidance&#13;
The MDPU should monitor the way in which major manpower development&#13;
institutions determine enrollment    policy.   Ideally,  in as   far as   this  is&#13;
determined by economic considerations, it should be justified in terms of rate&#13;
of return analysis. However, for some occupations projections of quantitative&#13;
requirements may be more appropriate, and where suitable data for either are&#13;
lacking, as is all too frequently the case, decisions have to be made on an&#13;
intuitive basis. Where formal analysis is used to guide enrollments, the MDPU&#13;
should review the underly-ing assumptions.&#13;
In the case of rate of return analysis, the MDPU will have to examine&#13;
the robustness of the estimates in the light of alternative assumptions about&#13;
future relative   wage  rat:es,  the  replacement  and  displacement  effects  of&#13;
training,  and   the  degree  to  which   existing  earnings   differentials  are&#13;
attributable to manpower development rather than native ability.        It should&#13;
r(tview the way in which ral:es of return are used to guide quantitative changes&#13;
i. enrollments and as far as possible encourage such response to take account&#13;
of the relationships between trends in the rate of return and enrollments as&#13;
well as current levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
In the case of manpower requirements projections, the MDPU will have&#13;
to pay especial attention to the scope for substitution, and if demographic or&#13;
social norms are employed, their justification should be assessed.&#13;
Whether enrollment policy is based on formal analysis or professional&#13;
judgment, it is inevitable that sooner or later decisions will be in need of&#13;
revision.   It is therefore an important     function of the MDPU to see that&#13;
manpower development institutions have the flexibility to respond to changes&#13;
in enrollment objectives.    In particular, the design of staff structure and&#13;
physical facilities should have an inbuilt capacity for allowing new courses&#13;
to be established, obsolete ones to be discontinued, and for allowing those&#13;
whose demand was underestimated to expand at the expense of those whose demand&#13;
was overestimated.    The MDPU will also be concerned that inertia does not&#13;
prevent this flexibility from being exercised as needed.&#13;
(viii)   Tasks relating to other policy issues&#13;
There are various types of high-level policy issues relating to the&#13;
manpower development sector which the MDPU may be better equipped to review&#13;
than the line ministries.    A common example is the question of subsidizing&#13;
manpower  development.    Subsidies  have  the   generally  desirable  effect   of&#13;
improving the accessibility of education and training, but they also tend to&#13;
make the private rate of return greater than the social rate, creating a&#13;
demand for places in excess of the number that can be justified on economic&#13;
grounds, and thereby transforming what may otherwise be a self-regulating&#13;
training market into one that requires intervention by the MDPU or other&#13;
planning agency. At the same time subsidies impose a financial burden and are&#13;
only one of many competing uses of public funds       in the sector.    The MDPU&#13;
should periodically update its position on subsidies as circumstances change.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
Issues which have implications for other sectors besides manpower&#13;
development may also be best handled by the MPDU.      For example, migration of&#13;
agricultural workers to urban areas may threaten the production of an export&#13;
crop and in turn the revenue received by the government through export&#13;
levies.   Possible remedial measures may be a reduction in the export        levy&#13;
which would enable proclucers to pay higher wages, and a long-term effort to&#13;
improve labour productivity by developing more mechanized techniques.      In any&#13;
event, analysis of the situation provided by the MDPU may stimulate the&#13;
ministries concerned to embark upon a coherent and timely policy rather than&#13;
allow the outcome to be determined by political conflict.&#13;
The original formulation of MDPU policy on most issues will require&#13;
an ad hoc special study, which is not part of the annual routine.      However if&#13;
the issue is chronic and in need of regular review, such reviews should form&#13;
part of the annual routine.&#13;
(ix)     Specification of the tasks&#13;
The annual routine will consist of a series of tasks which will be&#13;
s~xecuted  at   specified  dates   during   the   year   in  collaboration   with&#13;
representatives of cooperating agencies.&#13;
The preparatory work involved in the task will usually be undertaken&#13;
by the collaborating agencies.     The MDPU will arrange formal meetings with&#13;
representatives of the agencies for the purpose of discussing their work and&#13;
the action to be taken.&#13;
The MDPU will keep on file a briefing document which will contain the&#13;
following items:&#13;
a.   The objectives of the task.&#13;
b.   A list of the staff members of the MDPU and collaborating agencies&#13;
who will execute the task, giving post, department and address of&#13;
each.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
c.   A list of the reports to be written and other action to be taken at&#13;
the conclusion of the task.&#13;
d.   A calendar giving the dates by which the components        of the task&#13;
should be accomplished.&#13;
e.   Background   notes  on  the   task,  including   rationale  and   recent&#13;
experience in its implementation.&#13;
f.   A bibliography of studies and publications relevant to the task.&#13;
The briefing document itself should be updated each year, and it&#13;
would be convenient to keep it on a word-processor if the MDPU possesses one.&#13;
(x)      Securing collaboration&#13;
In general it will be neither necessary nor desirable for the MPDU to&#13;
use formal sanctions for securing collaboration from other agencies in the&#13;
sector. Indeed most agencies will be only too grateful if the MDPU provides&#13;
leadership in planning, especially if the timing of transactions in the&#13;
relevant  tasks  is coordinated   with  decision-making  during  the year.    For&#13;
example, the review of resource utilization should precede the preparation of&#13;
the budget for the next year, and the guidance for enrollments should precede&#13;
the annual decision on staff recruitment.&#13;
The main difficulty will be to replace naive notions of what planning&#13;
entails by a more realistic conception of the planning process.     The view that&#13;
planning consists of the preparation of detailed forecasts of supply and&#13;
demand may be deeply entrenched even where the approach is patently&#13;
impracticable, and changing such attitudes may require the exercise of&#13;
considerable patience and tact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
If formal sanctions are needed     to secure collaboration,    the most&#13;
obvious pressure points are control of capital expenditure, control of current&#13;
expenditure,  and control of staff recruitment.       The seconcl and  third are&#13;
usually invested with other centralized agencies of the government, and&#13;
perhaps  the   first  as  well,  but   if  the  MDPU  establishes   good  working&#13;
relationships with the relevant centralized agencies it may be able to&#13;
exercise a significant degree of influence, at least at an official level.&#13;
The problem is that these sanctions are blunt instruments and do not in&#13;
themselves guarantee effective compliance.     It is therefore to the advantage&#13;
of the MPDU if collabor;ation takes the form of constructive partnership rather&#13;
than following directives.&#13;
3. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE-AGENCY&#13;
There are two major roles for the Technical Assistance Agency (TAA)&#13;
in  the  promotion of effective manpower     planning.   It can   provide  direct&#13;
assistance to the national MDPU by training its staff, instituting the basis&#13;
of an annual routine, and establishing a self-propelled planning capability.&#13;
It may also be able to make contributions to the design of individual tasks,&#13;
drawing on the international experience of its experts and consultants and&#13;
their experience of what has proved fruitful and what has not.&#13;
(i)      Direct assistance to the MDPU&#13;
The first and possibly greatest problem facing a TAA consultant is&#13;
the inability of the staff of the typical MDPU to conceive of manpower&#13;
development planning e!xcept in terms of quantitative      forecasts of supply,&#13;
demand  and  derived  training   requirements.   This  is  in part   due  to  the&#13;
continuing effects of the early literature on manpower development planning&#13;
and in part due to the fact that planning in developing countries still tends&#13;
to be thought of in terms of blueprints rather than processes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
The difficulties facing the TAA consultant are compounded by the poor&#13;
economic training of the staff in the typical MDPU.         The National Planning&#13;
Department usually has a limited supply of able and qualified economists and&#13;
the MDPU is likely to be low on its list of priorities.           It is therefore&#13;
unrealistic to expect to find in most MDPUs staff who are competent enough to&#13;
establish an annual routine on their own even if they were convinced of its&#13;
virtues.   The solution    is  for  the TAA  to make   an  initial   investment  in&#13;
consultant time and provide it with a very detailed manual, and then to&#13;
provide short-term consultancy aid at intervals with the objective of&#13;
improving it.&#13;
(ii)     Accumulation of comparative experience&#13;
The other role for the TAA is research into the design of the annual&#13;
routine and the specification of the tasks within it.       In the first place, a&#13;
central core of tasks will be applicable to a wide variety of developing&#13;
countries and it makes little sense for each MDPU to duplicate the efforts of&#13;
others in this direction by designing its own core from scratch.       It would be&#13;
more sensible for the TAA consultant to take a core package and adapt it to&#13;
the institutional arrangements and specific requirements of the country.&#13;
Similarly, international experience may be useful in the design of&#13;
some of the more specialized tasks of the MDPU, particularly those where there&#13;
is no obvious approach. For those types of manpower development which are not&#13;
susceptible to formal analysis and for which informal techniques are not&#13;
satisfactory, it may be of use to the MDPU to know how its counterparts in&#13;
other countries have tackled the problem, and on this basis decide how to make&#13;
the best of a bad job, rather than abandon the task altogether.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
4. THE LENDING AGENCY&#13;
It need hardly be said that the development of borrowers' planning&#13;
capability is ultimately the single most important objective of the Lending&#13;
Agency in the manpower development sector,      as in any other.     If it can be&#13;
assumed that the provision of technical assistance, in the form of consultant&#13;
services, is the role of the Technical Assistance Agency, the contribution of&#13;
the Lending Agency may be made in two ways:      a general adaptation of its own&#13;
procedures to support the operation of a continuous process approach by the&#13;
MDPU, and direct assistance by funding training facilities such as management&#13;
science institutes and by providing research support based on its own&#13;
experience.&#13;
The adoption of a continuous process approach by a national MDPU will&#13;
have  two major consequ-ences    for  the Lending   Agency.   First,  criteria  for&#13;
project justification, like the planning process itself, will become more&#13;
flexible and less dependent on particular kinds of formal analysis.         Second,&#13;
the orientation of the I4DPU towards continuous programming may conflict with&#13;
the discrete project approach usually adopted by Lending Agencies.&#13;
(i)      Project justification&#13;
The common practice of couching project justification solely in terms&#13;
of formal analysis is unsatisfactory since decisions are seldom made solely or&#13;
even primarily as a result of it:       they are usually based on an intuitive&#13;
feeling that the project is worthwhile, and the role of formal analysis is at&#13;
mnost that of providing corroborative evidence.      It it is the intent of the&#13;
authors of a project document to reveal the factors that have been responsible&#13;
-or the project specification, it follows that the considerations which&#13;
underlie the professional judgment should not be concealed but described in&#13;
conjunction with the formal analysis.      They should certainly not be omitted&#13;
merely because they are subjective and qualitative in nature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
For  those   types  of  manpower  development   planning  where   formal&#13;
analysis has nothing of practical value to offer, insistence on it as a pro&#13;
forma requirement for project justification leads to the ultimate farce of the&#13;
real reasoning being completely replaced by make-believe.&#13;
This can have two further damaging repercussions.      It may encourage&#13;
those who understand how decisions are really made to undervalue the&#13;
contribution that can be made by formal analysis, limited though it may be,&#13;
and possibly allow arbitrary political factors to be more influential than&#13;
otherwise would be the case.     It is even possible that formal analysis may&#13;
come to be treated as mere window-dressing.       Conversely,  those who do not&#13;
understand   decision-making   may   be    induced   to   entertain   exaggerated&#13;
expectations about the value of formal analysis and be unreceptive to the&#13;
efforts of the MDPU to establish a broader, more eclectic continuous planning&#13;
approach.&#13;
Since an MDPU administering an effective annual routine should be in&#13;
an infinitely better position than an ephemeral Lending Agency mission to&#13;
acquire the detailed experience required for a professional judgment, the&#13;
over-riding aim of the Lending Agency should be to ensure that the necessary&#13;
institution-building takes place, probably in collaboration with a Technical&#13;
Assistance  Agency.   Ultimately   this  should  lead  to  the MDPU   becoming  a&#13;
stronger partner in all phases of a project - identification, preparation,&#13;
appraisal and execution - and to a corresponding economy in the organizational&#13;
resources required of the Lending Agency.&#13;
(ii)     Projects and processes&#13;
The effectiveness of a cybernetic approach will be the greater, the&#13;
smaller the intervals between execution, feedback and response.        It follows&#13;
that the MDPU should aim to implement its feeling-the-way approach by means of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
marginal   projects  commissioned   as  the  result  of  the  annual  update.    By&#13;
contrast the Lending Agency, with its comparative advantage in the delivery of&#13;
construction and equipment, prefers occasional, large projects, since the cost&#13;
to it of preparing and supervising projects is a function of their number as&#13;
well   as  of  the   tot31  disbursement.    As   a  result   of  these   different&#13;
perspectives, there is a direct conflict of interest and no easy solution.&#13;
The cost to the Lending Agency of the small-project approach should be reduced&#13;
by the increased capability of the MDPU, but nevertheless the remaining&#13;
supervisory cost/total cost ratio may be unacceptable to it.         On the other&#13;
hand the big-project approach will certainly undermine and possibly overwhelm&#13;
attempts by the MDPU to establish a sound annual routine.&#13;
Since the preference of the Lending Agency is likely to be decisive,&#13;
it is incumbent upon it to find some sort of compromise.        Certainly a total&#13;
neglect of the effects of its procedures on the long-term planning capability&#13;
of the MDPU is wholly unacceptable both from its own point of view and that of&#13;
the latter.&#13;
5. CONCLUSIONS&#13;
This chapter has argued that the effective management and planning of&#13;
the manpower development sector is conditional on (i) the existence of a&#13;
centralized coordinating agency in the form of an MDPU; (ii) the adoption by&#13;
it of a continuous-planning process on the lines of the decentralized annual&#13;
routine described in Section 2; and (iii) the use of cost-effectiveness as the&#13;
major economic principle for defining tasks within this process.      The approach&#13;
must have these features if the planning of the sector is to be comprehensive,&#13;
pragmatic and timely.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
The international agencies have long recognized that Borrowers&#13;
planning capability is in need of improvement, but it would appear that more&#13;
thought could be given to the question of how this might be achieved.       There&#13;
appears to be an assumption that the improvement will occur of its own accord&#13;
if the MDPU acquires better qualified staff and if it is encouraged to&#13;
participate to a greater extent in project generation.&#13;
However, this is almost certainly overoptimistic.     The shift towards&#13;
a continuous process approach requires a radical change in the style of the&#13;
operation of the typical MDPU, and it calls for a similar adjustment in the&#13;
style of operation of the international agencies.&#13;
Accompanying this change of orientation of planning is a need for an&#13;
amplification of its scope.    The functions of the MDPU should be expanded to&#13;
include  the   promotion  of   rational  decision-taking   within   the  manpower&#13;
development sector as well as the giving of direct guidance, and its interests&#13;
should be widened to cover administration, the flow of information, and the&#13;
operation of training and labor markets, as well as enrollment determination&#13;
and the effective use of resources.      The international agencies are already&#13;
moving in this direction but the movement should be faster and more deliberate.&#13;
Besides providing direct technical assistance and adapting their own&#13;
procedures, the international agencies can promote this reorientation in two&#13;
other important ways.   First, they can draw on their own immense experience to&#13;
provide  research  assistance   to  the MDPU   staff  of member   countries.   In&#13;
addition to such obvious topics as the question of where to locate vocational&#13;
training, they should investigate broad issues like whether the need for&#13;
active intervention by the MDPU could be reduced by improving flows of&#13;
information and the operation of training and labour markets. If parts of the&#13;
manpower development sector can be made self-regulating, the MDPU and the&#13;
international agencies can concentrate their efforts on the remainder.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Such studies   should not be undertaken on an ad hoc basis.          The&#13;
continuous-process  approach   provides  a natural   organizing  framework.   The&#13;
international  agencies   should  direct  their  energies   toward  defining  the&#13;
objectives which may realistically be entertained by the MDPU of a Borrower at&#13;
a given level of development, and to specifying the individual tasks which&#13;
constitute the annual routine.&#13;
Second,   they  can   do   much   to  accelerate   the   acceptance   of&#13;
continuous-process through their intercourse, formal and informal, with&#13;
high-ranking staff in the Borrower administration.     At best the reorientation&#13;
of the typical MDPU will be slow, partly because of innate conservatism,&#13;
partly because a continuous-process approach is conceptually rnore taxing than&#13;
a  target-hitting   approach,  and  partly   because  the  MDPU   will  encounter&#13;
resistance to change from other agencies within the domestic manpower&#13;
development sector.    The intellectual support of the international agencies&#13;
will be decisive to the success of the MDPU in making the transiLtion.&#13;
With regard to the use of formal analysis in the justification of&#13;
projects, the policy of the international agencies tends to be both too narrow&#13;
and too broad.   Where formal analysis is applicable, they shouLd rely less on&#13;
quantitative   forecasting   and   make   greater  use   of   other   approaches,&#13;
particularly rate of return analysis.    Cost-effectiveness has frequently been&#13;
strongly advocated, but its application is typically limited t:o the internal&#13;
margin, that is, to discovering the most efficient way of achieving a given&#13;
manpower development objective. Its potential use at the extensive margin, in&#13;
the form of rate of return analysis, has on the whole been under-exploited.&#13;
For  those  projects  where  no  formal  analysis  is of practical    value,  the&#13;
international   agencies  should   cease  requiring   its  presence   in  project&#13;
documentation and instead require that a persuasive case be made in other ways.&#13;

1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Over the past 20 years I have been involved intermittently with&#13;
attempts to apply economic analysis to the problems of educational planning.&#13;
In looking back over these years I am struck by how little progress seems to&#13;
have been made:   the literature on manpower planning seems little different to&#13;
what what was written two decades ago and, more important, the practice of&#13;
manpower planning seems hardly to have changed at all.&#13;
It is my impression that the plans made by manpower planners have&#13;
rarely had any effect on the policy decisions actually made.         The methods&#13;
used, however, have had the effect of discouraging the development of&#13;
information which could have been used to improve the policy making process.&#13;
In particular, they have led educators in developing countries to expect that&#13;
manpower planners will give them exact specifications on the number of&#13;
graduates of various types which they must produce to meet the economic goals&#13;
of the society; that the manpower planners have a precise methbd for deriving&#13;
these requirements; and that the requirements for universjity graduates,&#13;
angineers,   secondary   school   graduates,   vocationally    trained   workers,&#13;
agricultural extension workers,   lathe operators, bricklayers and bus drivers&#13;
can all be derived by the same method and with the same precision.&#13;
The creation of these expectations has had deliterious effects not&#13;
cnly because no such precise requirements can be, or need be, presented to&#13;
educators, but also because it has relieved the educators of the feeling of&#13;
responsibility for finding out how their graduates survive and perform in the&#13;
labor market, how their configurations of curricula affect the life chances of&#13;
their graduates, and how tlhe skills they seek to transit are utilized or not&#13;
ut;ilized.  In sum,   educators  have  felt  little  responsibility  to evaluate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
systematically the efficacy of the programs they have created and manpower&#13;
planning efforts have done little to create an awareness of the need for such&#13;
efforts.  This has emerged not because of bad intentions of manpower planners&#13;
but because there has been a misallocation of their efforts, with too much&#13;
attention being devoted to methodology and too little to improving flows of&#13;
information and to learning from experience.&#13;
Consequently, even after two decades of substantial manpower planning&#13;
efforts in many countries we have precious little information on how labor&#13;
markets operate in developing countries. Therefore, those interested in using&#13;
manpower planning to improve the functioning of the educational system should&#13;
put high priority on efforts to analyze and monitor developments in the labor&#13;
markets of various countries.    Attempts to determine how labor markets in a&#13;
given country actually work will be far harder work for manpower analysts than&#13;
making projections of manpower supply and demand but the rewards should be&#13;
commensurately greater.&#13;
2. THE EMERGENCE OF MANPOWER PLANNING&#13;
Manpower planning as part of economic development planning received&#13;
its major impetus in the late 1950s and early 1960s.      There are probably two&#13;
major factors that led to this sudden increase in interest. First, studies of&#13;
the economic growth of industrialized countries showed that only a small&#13;
proportion of the growth over long periods of time in those countries could be&#13;
explained by the increases in the capital stock and the labor force.      Some of&#13;
these studies suggested that improvements in the quality of the labor force,&#13;
as represented by education levels, was a factor contributing to some of the&#13;
additional growth.   Second, the end of colonial regimes in many areas of the&#13;
world created the situation in which newly independent countries were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
carefully examining the structure of their institutions and planning to move&#13;
as rapidly as possible to replace colonial skilled expatriate manpower with&#13;
nationals.   The desire to accomplish this replacement at the same time that&#13;
these countries were planning to accelerate the rate of economic growth, and&#13;
to modernize and diversify aspects of their economies led to the concern that&#13;
availability of various    types of   "critical" manpower could be a problem.&#13;
Sharp increases in enrollments in primary, secondary and higher education were&#13;
foreseen as both one of the fruits of independence and as a requisite for&#13;
sustained and accelerated economic growth.&#13;
In the 1950s, the need to attempt to plan systematically the level&#13;
and distribution of investment over longer periods of time came to be broadly&#13;
accepted.   A central part of the planning methodology was the attempt         to&#13;
project the composition of final demands for various types of output and,&#13;
through  input-output  techniques,  translate  these  demands  into the   implied&#13;
inter-industry structure of production.     In the 1960s,    it was increasingly&#13;
felt that the constraint on development and change might nol: be so much the&#13;
availability of capital    investment  funds  as  the  availability  of critical&#13;
skills  to work with    the  newly  created   capital  structure.   It was   felt&#13;
therefore, that the planning of economic change and of educational change&#13;
ought to be, and could be, carried out systematically and jointly.&#13;
In simplest terms, it was the hope, or the expectation, of those&#13;
advocating manpower pliinning that the general economic plans for growth could&#13;
be translated into a set of requirements for "critical" manpower, and, in&#13;
light of that, plans for educational system development could be shaped to&#13;
assure that the requirements would be met.     Hence, the growth in the skilled&#13;
labor force would be meshed with the general economic growth and the changing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
industrial structure which was necessary to realize that growth. The approach&#13;
to manpower planning which emerged from this perspective has come to be&#13;
labeled as the manpower requirements approach.&#13;
The contribution of educated manpower to the growth in GNP was also&#13;
emphasized in the late 1950s, and thereafter, by those who approached the&#13;
issue by applying the theory of investment in capital to human factors of&#13;
production. Human capital theorists suggested that the way to plan investment&#13;
in resources so as to foster faster economic growth was to invest in those&#13;
activities which showed the highest rate of economic return to the society.&#13;
Their calculations for developed countries suggested investment in education&#13;
had high rates of return.     The approach to manpower planning which emerged&#13;
from this perspective has come to be called the rate of return or benefit-cost&#13;
approach.&#13;
There ensued, starting in the mid 1960s, a major controversy, in the&#13;
economics and manpower planning literature and in international organizations,&#13;
over the relative strengths and weaknesses of these two somewhat different&#13;
approaches. This controversy over the two approaches appears to me to have&#13;
dominated the literature and practice of manpower planning for two decades.&#13;
There  is   sufficient  experience   with   the  manpower   requirements&#13;
projections and with rate of return studies to indicate that each has very&#13;
serious shortcomings as a method of deriving manpower-educational policy&#13;
guidance. More importantly, the expectation that there would be a single,&#13;
predominant method for manpower-education planning has proven misguided.&#13;
While elements of each of the two major methods advocated can be useful in a&#13;
comprehensive manpower analysis and planning activity, there is a far wider&#13;
range of tasks and methods which ought to be incorporated.      It appears to me&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
that one reason why this wider range of tasks and methods has been neglected&#13;
in practice is that discussions of potential manpower planning activities&#13;
almost always revert, quickly, to a rehash of the two-decade controversy about&#13;
which of the two methods, manpower requirements or rate of return, is "better".&#13;
3. WHY MANPOWER ANALYSIS OR PLANNING?&#13;
The central rationale for manpower analysis and planning activities&#13;
is to seek to avoid "critical surpluses" or "critical shortages" of workers at&#13;
various  levels  of  skills.    Examples  of  "critical  surpluses"  include  the&#13;
chronic   overproduction   of   doctors   and   engineers   in  'India,  or   the&#13;
overproduction of advanced degrees in the humanities in the United States in&#13;
the  late  1960s  and  1970s.   Examples  of  "critical  shortages"  include  the&#13;
shortages of aerospace e!ngineers in the United States in the early 1960s, and&#13;
shortages of geologists in the late 1970s; or the sorts of critical shortages&#13;
it was feared might emerge in a developing country undertaking a major new&#13;
industrial activity (e.g. steel fabrication in Zaire and a gas liquefication&#13;
project in East Malaysia). 1/&#13;
In addition to persistent disequilibria in narrowly defined labor&#13;
markets, one might also include problems of shortage and surplus of the sort&#13;
which spread broadly across labor markets such as the chronic labor surplus&#13;
thought to characterize many of the least developed countries or the chronic&#13;
labor shortages which characterized many European labor markets in the late&#13;
1950s and 1960s when large numbers of migrant workers were drawn in.&#13;
/ Economists will warn that I should be much more careful to be precise&#13;
about defining what I mean by surplus or shortage, but I will forgo that&#13;
precision in the interest of brevity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
Clearly there are other goals of a society, such as equitable income&#13;
distribution or improvements in quality of life, toward which manpower&#13;
planners might hope to contribute, but the most immediate rationale seems to&#13;
be the simple goal of avoiding critical surpluses and shortages.&#13;
With this simple rationale in mind, it seems to me that any effort in&#13;
manpower planning and analysis must be grounded in some conception of how the&#13;
labor markets in the given country operate.    Any educational plan derived from&#13;
manpower considerations must be based on some implicit view of how the labor&#13;
market will operate to allocate the manpower it will educate to various&#13;
economic functions.    For even if an educational plan is in some idealized&#13;
sense "correct", its presumed economic effects over the long run will not be&#13;
realized   unless  the   labor   market  operates   to   allocate  the   manpower&#13;
"appropriately".&#13;
Following this argument, in the next section I present a highly&#13;
stylized description of how labor markets might work.      My purpose is not to&#13;
argue that this description fits every labor market in developing countries&#13;
but rather simply to give an example of a conception of labor market&#13;
operations and then suggest how that conception might influence the activities&#13;
of manpower planners and analysts.&#13;
4. A STYLIZED DESCRIPTION OF LABOR MARKETS&#13;
For simplicity I divide the description into two parts, the private&#13;
sector and the public sector, suggest how the labor market might operate in&#13;
each sector, when "critical shortages" or "critical surpluses" might arise and&#13;
what might be done about them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
A.   The Private Sector&#13;
Let us first .,onsider an individual firm in the private sector.     Does&#13;
it do   "manpower  planining"?   In general,   the  answer  is  no;  it  does   not&#13;
generally estimate its future requirements for different sorts of manpower or&#13;
even its general employment level.&#13;
Many studies have been done in which employers are asked to estimate&#13;
their future employment: needs.    When the estimates of individual firns about&#13;
future employment are compared with their actual subsequent experience, the&#13;
record shows that the employers are not good predictors of their future labor&#13;
demands. One reason they are not good predictors is that they rarely try. We&#13;
may speculate as to some of the reasons.&#13;
First, there are the uncertainties of the course of economic activity&#13;
in the industry and what: their share of the market will be.      Second, they can&#13;
redefine the work structure for any given level of output by substituting one&#13;
type of labor for another, or capital and raw materials for labor, or vice&#13;
versa. A third and most important reason is, of course, l:hat individual&#13;
employers can in general depend on the ability&#13;
to hire from the external labor market different types of labor as they need&#13;
them; to do so they may have to pay higher wages. 2/&#13;
2/ In one sense individutal firms do do some manpower planning, to the extent&#13;
that the organizatiorn of the firm defines internal career structures, and&#13;
to the extent that they have on-the-job training efforts within their&#13;
organizational  structure.    But  little  of  this,  I believe! is based on&#13;
systematic long term projections.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
It seems reasonable to ask: if this is a fair characterization of&#13;
individual firms' behavior, does this lack of private-sector, firm-level&#13;
planning create "critical shortages" or "critical surpluses", as suggested&#13;
above?   In general,   the answer is no.     The reasons are that labor markets&#13;
evolve over time, relative wages change, supply responds rapidly through&#13;
job-shifting (and this is the reason that if we follow any individual's&#13;
career, we see often quite jagged career paths), and through new entraats into&#13;
the labor market.   It is the flexibility of the labor market, the mobility of&#13;
workers and firms and the responsiveness of both to relative wages, benefits&#13;
and opportunities which     prevent  the  emergence  of  "critical   shortages" or&#13;
"critical surpluses".&#13;
In the private sector, critical shortages of a persistent sort emerge&#13;
when there is a sudden and sizeable increase in the total demand for a given&#13;
skill and there is a long and expensive gestation period in the training for&#13;
such a skill (e.g., for geologists or aerospace engineers), and there is&#13;
little opportunity within the technology to substitute other forms of labor or&#13;
factors of production for that skill group (again, aerospace engineers), and&#13;
there is no "external" supply source for this particular type of skill (e.g.,&#13;
the gas liquification project in East Malaysia).      "Critical surpluses" emerge&#13;
if there is a sharp decrease in demand and there is little transferability of&#13;
highly specialized skills to other kinds of economic activities (e.g., in the&#13;
United States, a sharp decline in the demand for teachers of literature and&#13;
history).&#13;
The labor markets may not work in this flexible way if there are&#13;
special constraints that arise, for example, because of strictures of caste or&#13;
other social customs which diminish the mobility of labor or the willingness&#13;
of firms to utilize certain types of labor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
B.   The Public Sector&#13;
Though it may not seem so on first consideration, on careful&#13;
examination, it turns out that in the labor market the public sector operates&#13;
much like the private     sector does.    In general,  it must compete with the&#13;
private sector, and even where the government or the public sector is the&#13;
primary employer in a particular skill market, various sub-utnits within the&#13;
government will tend to compete for labor (thereby creating mobility across&#13;
jobs) and reshape the work structures in response to the relative availability&#13;
of different types of labor.&#13;
There are,   however,  some major exceptions    to this.    The  first is&#13;
where the public sector is the principal employer for a skill which has a long&#13;
gestation period and iinvolves high costs in producing it:, for example,&#13;
teachers,  doctors,  scientists.    A major   shift  in government   activities  in&#13;
these  areas  could  create   "shortages" or   "surpluses" which would     tend  to&#13;
persist.&#13;
Second, the government may initiate a major new activity or function&#13;
which causes a sharp shift in supply or demand for critical skills (for&#13;
example, the U.S. aerospace program) whose particular market is isolated from&#13;
supply   sources.   Similarly,   government   policy   may  cause  -a  shift   from&#13;
traditional external sou:rces of supply (such as a decision to cut off the&#13;
utilization of expatriates, or a major shift in licensing procedures for the&#13;
lmedical professions).&#13;
Third, the public sector may not have the ability to react flexibly&#13;
to changing labor market situations, particularly to wage adjustments.         This&#13;
difficulty is exacerbated by the propensity of the public sector to insist on&#13;
uniform wage scales which prevent it from adjusting relative wages within the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
public sector in response to shifts in relative supply and demands in&#13;
different skill markets.   In addition, activities in the public sector may be&#13;
under less pressure to reduce "inefficient use of manpower".&#13;
The most important way in which the public sector may differ from the&#13;
private, however, is that it often underwrites, or at least controls, the&#13;
major  source of supply    for particular skills.     It does  this  through  its&#13;
underwriting or control of educational institutions, through its special&#13;
regulations on the licensing of certain activities, and through its control on&#13;
external sources of labor by immigration and emigration policies.&#13;
5. KEY ELEMENTS IN A REVISED PERSPECTIVE&#13;
Three key elements shape the perspective on the appropriate role for&#13;
manpower planning; these elements are:&#13;
-    The conception of how     labor markets   operate which   stresses  that&#13;
criticial shortages and surpluses of trained manpower are for the&#13;
most part likely to emerge only where the gestation period for&#13;
training in that skill is long and expensive.&#13;
-    The fact that in most developing countries 80 to 90 percent of those&#13;
types of manpower for which gestation periods are long, usually&#13;
referred to as "highly qualified" manpower, are employed by the&#13;
public sector.&#13;
-    The international evidence on attempts to project manpower demand and&#13;
supply over long periods of time, indicates that they are not likely&#13;
to be very successful.&#13;
From these three elements the following conclusions can be derived:&#13;
a.   Considering element a, for the most part a country does not have to&#13;
carry out long-term manpower projections in order to avoid the&#13;
emergence of sustained "critical shortages" or "critical surpluses".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
b.   From element c, even if one felt such long-term projections might in&#13;
some sense be "needed", it is unlikely that they can be done with&#13;
sufficient predictive accuracy to be useful for policy-making.&#13;
c.   Finally,  for those types of manpower where long gestation periods&#13;
make projections and planning potentially useful (element a), the&#13;
fact that they are largely employed in the public sector (element b)&#13;
indicates that projections which are derived from general economic&#13;
plans reflecting expected changes in economy-wide economic structure&#13;
will be not only imprecise (element c) but largely irrelevant since&#13;
specific public policy and institutions are more significant than&#13;
general economic structure in determining the configuration of public&#13;
sector employment.&#13;
These considerations indicate that making long-term projections of&#13;
manpower supply and demand on the basis of general economy-wide planning&#13;
methods is not likely to be a very fruitful enterprise for a developing&#13;
country.   Unfortunately, in many developing countries this is precisely the&#13;
activitiy which has taken up most of the time and resources of manpower&#13;
planning groups.&#13;
Perhaps one of the things that made the types of manpower planning&#13;
proposed in the 1960s So attractive to both planners and policy makers in&#13;
developing countries waEt that a single basic method (deriving projections of&#13;
manpower demands from the central economic plans and compiaring them to&#13;
manpower supplies projected from formal educational institut:ions and then&#13;
adjusting to remove imba:Lances) seemed to many to promise to "dio the job" for&#13;
all levels of manpower and to deal with most manpower problems.      As suggested&#13;
above, time and experience have shown this promise to be empty and the hope&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
for a single, unified method false.      In light of this previous expectation&#13;
about a single predominant method for manpower planning the proposals for the&#13;
role and methods which I outline below will appear various, scattered,&#13;
difficult to implement and, perhaps even ad hoc.     Fortunately, in a companion&#13;
essay in this volume C.R.S. Dougherty attempts to define the kind of&#13;
organizational framework in which such a range of manpower analysis and&#13;
planning activities could be implemented.     Most of what follows then is an&#13;
attempt to develop an illustrative list of the range and type of manpower&#13;
analyses and planning that are consistent with the basic perspective outlined&#13;
above and which are, in my opinion, likely to generate useful information.&#13;
6. AN OUTLINE OF MANPOWER ANALYSIS AND PLANNING&#13;
In order to cover a wide range of issues rather briefly, I have&#13;
organized the issues in a rough two-way cross-classification according to the&#13;
skill level of manpower (high, middle and low) and the sector of employment&#13;
(private, public, and education).    Table 1 provides an indication of some of&#13;
the issues within that cross-classification.&#13;
B.   High Level Manpower&#13;
i.   The Private Sector&#13;
In many developing countries 80 to 90 percent of the higher level&#13;
manpower is employed in the public sector.     Therefore, what the public sector&#13;
does is going to be significant in determining the extent of "critical&#13;
surpluses" or "shortages" which emerge for higher level manpower.        For most&#13;
high-skill categories the private sector will be competing at the margin in a&#13;
market dominated by the public sector.    This suggests that in general in this&#13;
broad category the major issue of concern is relative salary scales in the two&#13;
sectors. Just how great are the differences in salary (and other benefit)&#13;
levels between the two sectors and how rapidly do persons in these professions&#13;
respond to such differentials by shifting sector of employment?&#13;

There are a few higher level manpower groups with a large&#13;
proportion employed in the private sector (e.g., engineers, accountants and&#13;
lawyers).  The literature on manpower planning is littered with the record&#13;
of attempts to project and plan for engineer supply and demand and almost&#13;
all of these of which     I am aware have proved clear failures.       Several&#13;
itudies  have  shown   that  for  many   types  of  engineering  there   is  a&#13;
,:onsiderable amount of upward and downward mobility between technicians and&#13;
engineers  as the market    tightens  and loosens.    This suggests there   is&#13;
considerably greater flexibility in the requirements for formal engineer&#13;
training than has often been assumed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
For those engineering disciplines with more narrow and rigid&#13;
training requirements one can only suggest more detailed attempts to study&#13;
the factors which seem to be important in influencing utilization of this&#13;
type of engineer.   One other factor to be considered is that many highly&#13;
trained professionals such as engineers have professional associations and&#13;
the numbers of such persons in a given country is likely to be small&#13;
relative  to the population.     Use of professional    registries may be an&#13;
important way of gaining more information about how markets for these&#13;
professionals are operating.&#13;
Another topic of importance in some countries is the use of&#13;
expatriate personnel.   Most developing countries have been trying to reduce&#13;
steadily their use of high-level expatriate manpower. This is a reasonable&#13;
goal.   However, it should also be remembered     that high-level expatriate&#13;
manpower can be used to relieve "critical shortages" and more importantly&#13;
they can be used intelligently to assure a smooth transition to greater&#13;
reliance on domestic sources of supply.    An attempt to replace expatriates&#13;
too rapidly can result in the building of training capacity which is too&#13;
large relative to the long-term flow of graduates which can be sustained&#13;
e.g. in attempting to replace expatriate engineers rapidly the engineering&#13;
faculty is built up to a size that will produce a flow of graduates which&#13;
is two or three times the flow of graduates which could be absorbed in the&#13;
labor market over the long run.     Using expatriate manpower intelligently&#13;
could allow for a slow build up of the stock of domestic sources to an&#13;
appropriate, sustainable long-term capacity.&#13;
ii. The Public Sector&#13;
As the predominant employer of most professional and technical&#13;
workers, it would seem that the public sector could contribute a great deal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
toward  improved  understanding  of   the  operations  of  labor  markets  for&#13;
high-level manpower by maintaining systematic, comparable data on the&#13;
members of its work iJorce (e.g., education, training, work history) and&#13;
rates of pay for various types of workers, and making these data available&#13;
to manpower analysts.&#13;
If such data are to be really useful, it is important: they be made&#13;
available on a micro basis, not aggregated across individuals.         In some&#13;
countries   such  data  may   already  have  been   gathered  and   been  made&#13;
accessible.   If a government is really going to press for better analysis&#13;
of high level manpower problems, it would seem reasonable for it to try to&#13;
meet this very minimal requirement of getting its own employment data base&#13;
in shape.&#13;
Rather than trying to suggest specific pieces of analysis which&#13;
might be undertaken for high-level manpower in the public secl:or I want to&#13;
suggest a process through which such analyses might be developed.         This&#13;
approach is taken since there is no uniform method applicable across the&#13;
entire public sector and the procedure should be to shape the analysis to&#13;
the character of the manpower problems in each sub-sector: the analysis&#13;
should proceed ministry by ministry.    The character of the problems and the&#13;
appropriate methods for analyzing them will vary substantially from one&#13;
sub-sector to another.    For example, the methods for analyzing supply and&#13;
demand situations with regard to doctors and nurses will necessarily be&#13;
quite different from those which would be called for in analyzing the high&#13;
level manpower situation in public works regarding, for example, the&#13;
availability of engineers and engineering technicians.      Manpower analysis&#13;
in the health sector will be concerned with demographic i'actors, the&#13;
geographical dispersion of health facilities, the interplay between private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
and public health facilities, and the flow of health professionals into and&#13;
out of the country.     In contrast,  in public works, government plans for&#13;
growth in public facilities, transportation structure, water, and other&#13;
utilities will be important.      Appropriate  staffing  for maintenance will&#13;
also be a factor.    For these reasons, it seems inevitable that an effort&#13;
must  be   made  to  help   each  sub-sector   to  develop   manpower  analysis&#13;
procedures shaped to the particular nature of their problems.&#13;
It should be said, however, that in all cases it is important not&#13;
simply to concentrate on trying to estimate future supply and demand.&#13;
Since the major problems may arise from how the incentives in the&#13;
profession are structured, analysis of this aspect of the labor market is&#13;
more  important than making    projections.    With  respect  to the   incentive&#13;
structure, the problems of the public sector in determining wage and&#13;
benefit levels can be of great importance.       The propensity of governments&#13;
to set wage scales uniformly across fields of specialization (often related&#13;
only to the level of educational attainment) handicaps the public sector in&#13;
competing with the private     sector  for skilled manpower.      Likewise,  the&#13;
relative earnings and benefits of the secondary or technician level of&#13;
professional manpower compared to that of the highest level of manpower is&#13;
often a problem. A common complaint in many countries is that neither the&#13;
public nor private sector is able to recruit and hold sufficient second&#13;
level professional manpower, because the disparity in earnings is so great&#13;
that there are strong incentives for second level technicians to attempt to&#13;
reach the qualifications which will carry them into the higher wage scales.&#13;
Effective manpower information and analyses from each sub-sector&#13;
will not be obtained simply by sending out a request or a requirement that&#13;
certain numbers be provided.      Agencies need help in determining how to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
shape the manpower analysis to their problems; how to do the analysis; what&#13;
information   they   need   and  what   information   they   should   provide;&#13;
specifically  what   information   should  flow  upward   in  the   government&#13;
organization and in what form.&#13;
While suggesting this general process for developing manpower&#13;
analysis in the public sector, agriculture is an area which, I believe, in&#13;
most developing countries deserves special attention.        The structure  of&#13;
agriculture can vary very sharply from country to country and therefore the&#13;
kinds of high level manpower - research scientists, technicians, extension&#13;
workers, marketing specialists, agricultural engineers - can be quite&#13;
different from one country to the next.     For example, some countries have&#13;
large proportions of their agricultural output in tree crops, e.g., rubber,&#13;
cocoa, coffee, while others are primarily dependent on grain production.&#13;
Their needs for high level skills will surely be quite different: and&#13;
detailed manpower analysis will be necessary to shape plans to these crop&#13;
specific differences.&#13;
iii. The Education Sector&#13;
In  virtually   all  developing  countries   primary  and   secondary&#13;
education teachers account for over 50 percent of all professional and&#13;
technical workers.   Manpower analysis in the education sector at the high&#13;
level must be focused on the circumstances of this group.     The methods for&#13;
analysing the determinants of teacher supply and demand are relatively&#13;
well-developed   and  straightforward,   at  least   as  they  apply   to  the&#13;
quantitative side of the analysis.&#13;
If we look at the education sector not just as a utilizer of high&#13;
level manpower but also as a supplier, then, the issues to be addressed&#13;
become  much   wider.   It  is  perhaps   in  this  area   that  the  greatest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
expectations have arisen with regard to the ability of manpower planners to&#13;
tell educators how many of various types of high level manpower they should&#13;
produce. As has already been emphasized, it is very important to make&#13;
clear to educators that this is for the most part a false hope.&#13;
It was stated at the outset of this paper that educators need to&#13;
feel, and take, responsibility for finding out, in a systematic way, what&#13;
happens to the graduates from their programs when they enter the labor&#13;
market. The most important step that can be taken in regard to production&#13;
of high level manpower is to improve information about how the graduates of&#13;
post-secondary institutions are currently absorbed into the labor market.&#13;
This can be partially done through analysis of large scale national survey&#13;
data,  such as the labor     force  survey  and  the census.    But where   very&#13;
particular information is sought for narrowly defined types of training,&#13;
the method that holds the greatest promise is the tracer study.&#13;
In a tracer study, attempts are made to obtain a sample of recent&#13;
graduates of an institution and find out about their experiences in the&#13;
labor market over time.     This can be done in either of two ways.         From&#13;
records, graduates of an institution over, say, the previous five years can&#13;
he identified, contacted and interviewed about their working experience&#13;
from the time of graduation to the time of interview.        Alternatively, the&#13;
sample members to be studied can be selected as they graduate from the&#13;
institution  and  then   reinterviewed  periodically   thereafter.    There  are&#13;
different strengths and weaknesses of each method which I need not go into&#13;
here. Tracer studies are of most use, of course, when comparisons can be&#13;
made concerning the labor market experience of the graduates of various&#13;
sorts of institutions or between the graduates of a given institution and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
a "control group" of individuals who received no formal tertiary education.&#13;
The most important features of the tracer study method are that they closely&#13;
link the individual tc the institution in which training was received - and&#13;
therefore make it possible to provide more precise information on their&#13;
training and associated. costs - and that tracing their experie!nce over time in&#13;
the labor market results in a more dynamic picture of the operations of the&#13;
market. 3/&#13;
In many countries in Asia and Africa, widescale unemployment amongst&#13;
graduates of post-seco-ndary institutions has been a concern.      Tracer studies&#13;
are particularly helpful in analyzing this sort of issue.     Key questions are:&#13;
how long does it take graduates to find their first job; when. they find jobs,&#13;
what are their earnings levels; how fast do their earnings rise and how often&#13;
do they change jobs?   Those who take longer to find jobs may, in fact, search&#13;
out better ones and end up with higher rates of pay.       Thus, the view of the&#13;
social costs of unemployment can vary according to the details of the long&#13;
term experience of the individuals.&#13;
I have already suggested that tracer studies are most powerful when&#13;
comparisons can be made as between alternative types of training. This can be&#13;
extended more generally in the education sector to suggest that more&#13;
cost-benefit analyses of alternative programs be undertaken.&#13;
In some countries very large numbers of students seek post-secondary&#13;
training overseas. Often there is very poor information regarding, what type&#13;
3/ Another argument in favor of tracer studies is that they will yield data&#13;
which may more closiely approximate marginal benefits and costs. A common&#13;
complaint about most benefit-cost or rate of return studies is that the&#13;
data reflect average rather than marginal benefits and cosits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
of studies they are pursuing, what proportion of them return to the country&#13;
and  what  proportion   re-emigrate.   For  some  countries   the  proportion  of&#13;
students trained overseas is so large that changes in overseas education and&#13;
training policies could be as important to the supply and demand of high level&#13;
manpower in the country as developments in the post-secondary institutions&#13;
within the country.&#13;
B.   Middle Level Manpower&#13;
i.   The Private Sector&#13;
For middle level manpower in general, the training period is not&#13;
extremely long and, therefore, critical shortages are not likely to persist&#13;
unless there are inappropriate signals or institutional constraints on the&#13;
operations of the labor market.      The major need then, with regard to this&#13;
level of manpower in the private sector is to improve understanding about the&#13;
operations of the labor market at this level, particularly with respect to&#13;
wages,  rates of turnover,   and vacancies.    In most countries data on these&#13;
dimensions of the labor market are fragmentary and have been gathered in&#13;
uncoordinated ways, if at all. What would be most valuable is continuous time&#13;
series data collected on a comparable basis covering the various industrial&#13;
sectors of the economy. This kind of data allows continuous monitoring of the&#13;
development of the labor market and provides better indications of those parts&#13;
of the market where shortages or surpluses may be emerging.&#13;
A recently developed survey in Malaysia, the Employment Turnover&#13;
Survey, is an extremely promising and sophisticated example of an instrument&#13;
which can be used to obtain insights regarding the workings of the labor&#13;
market  at  the middle   level  of manpower   and below.    This  survey  gathers&#13;
systematic data on quits, hires, and promotions at various skill levels for a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
sample of firms in various industries and regions in the country.       As this is&#13;
a new survey, there is relatively little to report yet on its findings but as&#13;
repeated samples are developed and analyzed, it will be possible to get a far&#13;
clearer picture of the dynamics of the labor market in that country.&#13;
Training of middle level manpower is a subject which has received a&#13;
fair amount of discussion in a number of countries.       While there has been a&#13;
good  deal   of  discussion   there  has   been  relatively   litt:le  quantitative&#13;
analysis.    This  is not   surprising,  because  it  is  extremely  difficult   to&#13;
measure the extent of training which goes on outside of formal educational&#13;
institutions.   The boundaries between courses, on-the-job training, and actual&#13;
work processes are very difficult to determine.&#13;
Perhaps as a result of this, greater reliance has been placed upon&#13;
statements of employer3 about the adequacy of the training their labor force&#13;
receives.   Invariably, it is reported that the training is :inadequate.       This&#13;
response   seems   invariant   with   the   level  of   developme!nt:  or  of   the&#13;
sophistication of the :Labor force of their firm.    These responses by employers&#13;
are inevitably followed by arguments for the importance of tax incentives or&#13;
subsidies to enhance training in particular parts of the private sector.&#13;
Suggestions for such schemes have been made in several countries, but analyses&#13;
of their effectiveness have been very few.      In light of this, I have a fair&#13;
amount of skepticism about formalized government intervention in the area of&#13;
training in the private sector.      Certainly,  before attempting to implement&#13;
such schemes, efforts should be made to gather information about experiences&#13;
other countries have had with such schemes, both the failures and the&#13;
successes. It is important that evaluations of these policies should be based&#13;
on measures of actual outcomes, not simply on "expert opinions".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
A third issue that is potentially of some importance for middle level&#13;
manpower  in the private    sector  is immigration   and  emigration.    In recent&#13;
years, it appears that many countries in Asia have had substantial outflows of&#13;
middle   level  manpower  to  countries   in  the  Middle   East.   The  flows   of&#13;
remittances sent by such workers back to their home country can provide&#13;
important balance of payments contributions (e.g., in the past for several&#13;
Mediterranean countries and currently for Egypt, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri&#13;
Lanka).   However, the fact that these flows tend to be pro-cyclical,        i.e.,&#13;
workers leave their home country as the world economic activity increases and&#13;
return home during world recessions, exacerbates the problems of the home&#13;
country by, on the one hand, making middle level workers scarce during periods&#13;
when the situation is favorable for the country's exports and the economic&#13;
base could be built upon and, on the other hand, creating a surplus of middle&#13;
level workers when recession already makes it difficult to maintain domestic&#13;
employment and economic growth. As already mentioned with respect to overseas&#13;
factors affecting high level manpower, this phenomenon could upset even the&#13;
most carefully developed plans for middle level manpower development.          More&#13;
analysis is needed to develop alternative, sensible policies which might&#13;
moderate the impact of these sorts of developments.&#13;
ii. The Public Sector&#13;
In most countries, the problem at the middle level of manpower in the&#13;
public sector seems to be the development of appropriate relative wages (both&#13;
with regard to the private sector and with regard to the upper levels of the&#13;
public sector) and the development of appropriate career structures.       As with&#13;
higher level technicians, the often-heard complaint is that the incentives for&#13;
middle level manpower to attempt to gain paper qualifications that will carry&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
them into the higher levels of the wage structure are inordinately high.        A&#13;
recent report on Brazil, for example, suggested that overproduction of&#13;
engineers and underproduction of industrial technicians was occurring because&#13;
of a bias in preferences toward higher level qualifications.&#13;
Again, as with the professional-level manpower in the public sector,&#13;
the problem of uniform scales undifferentiated as to specialized functions&#13;
seems to arise in a number of cases and may exacerbate the problems of&#13;
developing appropriate incentive structures for middle level manpower of&#13;
various  sorts.   The  most   important  step  in  trying  to  get  some  insight&#13;
regarding the extent of these problems would be, once again, for the public&#13;
sector   to   attempt   to   systematize   its   personnel    records   regarding&#13;
characteristics of its employees at each level and their rates of pay and&#13;
benefits.   Such data would    provide  a much better    picture  than  has  been&#13;
available to date in most countries of the public sector's sources and uses of&#13;
middle level manpower. To date the degree to which the types of problems just&#13;
discussed arise, and thieir causes, are judged almost solely on very partial&#13;
and anecdotal evidence.&#13;
iii. The Education Sector&#13;
In many countries there has been increasing concern about the&#13;
appearance of increasing unemployment among those with some secondary&#13;
education.  However, in some cases, analysis has show that what appeared to be&#13;
persistant unemployment   problems  among secondary   school  leavers were more&#13;
problems of dynamic adjustment as they entered the labor force rather than&#13;
long term, persistant unemployment. 4/ As suggested above, tracer studies can&#13;
be  important   instruments  for   gaining  insights   regarding   these  dynamic&#13;
adjustments of new labor market entrants.&#13;
4/  See,   for  example,  Blaug   [1974],  for   a  discussion  of   this  issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
In the education sector, an important issue with regard to middle&#13;
level manpower appears to be: what is the appropriate role for formal,&#13;
vocational education? In every developing country with which I am acquainted,&#13;
either directly or through the literature, there has at some time in the last&#13;
two decades been a major push to increase vocational education at the&#13;
secondary  level.    This  push  has  almost  always   been  based  upon:  a)   the&#13;
statements by employers regarding the adequacy of the training of their labor&#13;
force of the sort already referred to above, and b) the general observation&#13;
that most of those who pass beyond the primary level do not go on to further&#13;
education but enter either agriculture, rural enterprises or the urban service&#13;
and  industrial   sector.    It  is  presumed,  by   those  advocating  vocational&#13;
education, that formal educational training which is related more directly to&#13;
these activities will ease the transition from school to work and perhaps&#13;
enhance  productivity.    There  are  startingly  few  studies  which   attempt  to&#13;
estimate the actual effectiveness of vocational education in a formal setting.&#13;
In some cases, the ineffectiveness of the vocational education&#13;
program has been judged by the fact that it has proved difficult to fill the&#13;
available   places   in   the   programs.    Others   have   suggested   that   the&#13;
effectiveness of the program should be judged by the proportion of the&#13;
graduates who actually end up in jobs for which they were trained.         Both of&#13;
these methods may be misleading.&#13;
With regard to unfilled places, the failure of a program to attract&#13;
students can occur for a whole host of reasons. For example, one study showed&#13;
that while the training for agricultural technical workers was probably&#13;
valuable, the students were aware that the government wage scales for those&#13;
kinds of workers were not sufficiently high to warrant the time and expense of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
completing the course. Similarly, judging success by the percent ending up in&#13;
specified jobs is risky. There is no reason to expect that 100 percent of the&#13;
graduates of any training program should end up in the occupations for which&#13;
they were   trained.   (In  fact,  in the   stylized  view  of tlhe  labor market&#13;
sketched out above it was the flexibility and response of workers and firms&#13;
and the mobility across firms in response to different opportunities which, it&#13;
was argued, reduced the likelihood that critical shortages or surpluses would&#13;
emerge and persist).&#13;
For these reas;ons, the appropriate methods for analyzing vocational&#13;
education are,   once again,   tracer  studies  and  cost-benefit   analyses.   The&#13;
tracer studies will permit comparisons of the subsequent labor market&#13;
experience of those with and without vocational education or of those with&#13;
various types of vocational education.     Using the information from the tracer&#13;
studies,  in the context of a cost-benefit      analysis,   it could  emerge,   for&#13;
example, that as little as 40 percent of the graduates of a vocational program&#13;
actually enter the trade for which they were trained, but that the increased&#13;
productivity and earnings of this 40 percent more than justify the higher&#13;
costs of the educational training.     On the other hand, though 80 percent of&#13;
the graduates might enii up in the trade for which they are trained,        it may&#13;
turn out in the cost-bienefit framework that the higher costs associated with&#13;
the facilities and equipment or the expensive instructors in such programs&#13;
more than outweight the additional social benefits which the graduates of the&#13;
program generate.&#13;
A second issue at the middle level of manpower is related to the&#13;
distribution of secondary education between science and non-science courses.&#13;
It appears to be the feeling in many countries that there is insufficient&#13;
science training at the secondary level.      This judgement may be correct, but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
in many cases the basis for it is not made clear.      One argument that has been&#13;
put forward, for example in the United States, is that the proportion of&#13;
graduates from higher education in sciences as opposed to the non-sciences is&#13;
completely determined by the choice of science and non-science made at the&#13;
secondary level.   That is, there is very little switching from non-science to&#13;
science emphasis during the course of post-secondary education.        If this is&#13;
correct, it would suggest that the ability of the society to respond to&#13;
changes in the relative requirements for science versus non-science manpower&#13;
would be extremely limited and that study of factors which influence the&#13;
choice between science and non-science pursuits at the secondary level would&#13;
be of great importance.&#13;
Another basis upon which the argument for encouraging or even forcing&#13;
more students into science curricula is sometimes made is complaints from&#13;
employers that the secondary school-leavers applying to their firms have an&#13;
inadequate basis in science.     It would seem that analysis of the subsequent&#13;
labor market experience of school-leavers with high levels of science training&#13;
as compared to those with lower levels of science training and of the factors&#13;
that seem to influence the choice of students between science and non-science&#13;
training would help to improve understanding and decision-making in this area.&#13;
C.   Low Level Manpower&#13;
i.   The Private Sector&#13;
Extensive analyses of broad issues concerning the labor market and&#13;
employment form the foundation for sound manpower analysis and planning and I&#13;
have chosen to place these types of studies in this category.&#13;
The most fundamental information for manpower analysis is, of course,&#13;
the characteristics of the population. The emphasis on population programs in&#13;
the last two decades has fostered extensive analyses of the determinants of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
demographic changes. Methods for projecting demographic change have been well&#13;
developed and made readily available to most developing countries through&#13;
various international and national agencies.     For the major features of the&#13;
working age population with which most manpower analysis will be concerned it&#13;
is my opinion that quite reliable information can be developed and maintained&#13;
using methods readily available and with relatively little time and effort.&#13;
After the size and general characteristics of the working age&#13;
population the next question is the size of the labor force.        The critical&#13;
issue here, at present, appears to be the determinants of the labor force&#13;
participation rate for females and how these are likely to change over time.&#13;
In many countries there has been relatively little study of this issue.&#13;
For   some  countries,   there  have   been   sizeable  year   to   year&#13;
fluctuations in the labor force participation rate in rural. areas, at least&#13;
according to available survey data.      While in many developing countries it&#13;
appears that labor surplus rather than labor shortage is the problem some&#13;
countries appear to be reaching the point where labor shortages, at least in&#13;
certain regions, in the agricultural sector could become a problem.      The long&#13;
term viability of certain types of agriculture may depend critically on the&#13;
size of the available rural labor force and therefore analysis of factors&#13;
affecting labor force participation rates can be important.&#13;
A careful monitoring of the rate and character of open unemployment&#13;
is also critical for understanding the dynamics of the labor market in any&#13;
country.   The phenomenon of underemployment    is far more difficult both to&#13;
measure and to underestand.    It is obviously more important in rural areas&#13;
where  open  unemployment   is  less  likely  to  emerge.   Looking  at  how  the&#13;
structure of hours worked and part-time work have evolved over time in the&#13;
country should be part of any effort to analyze under-employment.&#13;

Issues of rural-urban migration have been the subject of a great deal&#13;
of discussion.   While in a few countries careful surveys and analyses have&#13;
been done to improve understanding of migration, in many countries analysis&#13;
has been limited to data drawn from the decenial census.      This is a topic of&#13;
high priority for manpower analysis.     A proper understanding of rural-urban&#13;
migration in the past and its implications for the future requires in most&#13;
cases a specially designed national sample survey.       This is because it is&#13;
desirable to determine not only the extent of rural-urban migration, but also&#13;
the circumstances in which such decisions were made and the results of&#13;
movements from one area to another.&#13;
Not only is internal migration of some importance, so also is&#13;
international migration.   Its potential importance for high and middle level&#13;
manpower has   already been   stressed.   Flows  of refugees   and migrants   can&#13;
present sizeable problems for some countries and have implications for&#13;
education, training and employment that deserve careful attention.&#13;
The emphasis on issues of income inequality, poverty and basic needs&#13;
in the past decade has led to a greater focus on particular poor subgroups of&#13;
the population, e.g. in the urban sector, squatters and hawkers, in the rural&#13;
sector,  small  single  crop  farmers,  landless  agricultural   laborer  groups,&#13;
fishermen.   Formulation   of  government  policies   to  improve  the   economic&#13;
circumstances of these groups requires special studies of the factors which&#13;
limit their economic opportunities and continued monitoring to evaluate the&#13;
effectiveness of such efforts.    Formal education and training may be part of&#13;
such policies but what role they might play needs to be determined by analyses&#13;
of their current circumstances.    For example, one study of single crop padi&#13;
farmers in Malaysia, a particular poor segment of the population, showed that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
they were already earning 40 percent of their income outside of agriculture.&#13;
A training program aimed at improving their productivity as padi farmers might&#13;
well be less effective than one designed to improve their earnings from&#13;
non-agricultural activities.&#13;
ii. The Public Sector&#13;
As noted for the public sector at the other levels of manpower, it is&#13;
important   to   try  to   ensure   that   information   concerning   major   new&#13;
governmentally   sponsored  initiatives   which   may  affect   the  demand   for&#13;
particular types of manpower even at the lowest skill levels is systematically&#13;
gathered and made available.    For example, changes in government policy with&#13;
regard to the opening of new land settlements can have sizeable impacts on&#13;
particular rural labor markets, as can the development of new irrigation&#13;
schemes or major changes in the transportation network.&#13;
More generally, it would appear that while most of agriculture is in&#13;
the private sector, it is the public sector which can best attempt to take a&#13;
comprehensive and systematic look at the evolution of supply, and demand for&#13;
manpower within it.&#13;
D.   Special Studies&#13;
The manpower issues listed above by sector and by level of manpower&#13;
are, I believe, the ones which deserve and require continuous       analysis and&#13;
monitoring.   There are, however, in addition, some special topics which may&#13;
require only one-time special manpower analysis efforts.      Some of these are&#13;
listed below.&#13;
i.   The Construction Industry&#13;
In many countries the construction sector appears periodically to be&#13;
a key bottleneck.    In a number of countries problems with this sector have&#13;
become   particularly   heightened  because   of   the  flow   of  middle   level&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
construction artisans and technicians to the Middle East.    A special, in-depth&#13;
study of the characteristics of the labor force at all levels in the&#13;
construction industry would seem to be necessary to provide a basis for&#13;
improved understanding of when and why the manpower bottlenecks develop in&#13;
this sector.&#13;
The way the construction sector is organized and operates apparently&#13;
varies quite considerably across countries but some international information&#13;
may yield some useful insights. Undoubtedly, given the complex configurations&#13;
of skills that go into construction, understanding the dynamics of the labor&#13;
markets will be rather difficult.&#13;
ii. Regional Studies&#13;
In every country, no matter how large, government units below the&#13;
national level are never satisfied with studies that apply to the nation as a&#13;
whole, but wish to have more disaggregated analyses of the situation as it&#13;
applies to their particular region.    The critical problem is, of course, that&#13;
reliable small area data are very difficult to gather systematically and in a&#13;
sustained fashion over time.   It is simply too expensive.    Therefore, this is&#13;
an area in which clever and imaginative use of records which are gathered&#13;
regularly for other purposes can have a large payoff.     The educational system&#13;
is one such source of detailed small-area data about the population.       Social&#13;
security system records are another potential source of detailed information&#13;
regarding the labor force and earnings in the industrialized sector for&#13;
various small areas.&#13;
However, in the same way that it is of critical importance to have&#13;
educational decision-makers understand that planners are not going to be able&#13;
to provide them with reliable indications of the types of particular manpower&#13;
needed, it is also important to try to make those concerned with regional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
problems understand those limitations of data which preclude a systematic&#13;
investigation of a number of regional issues.    It may simply not be possible,&#13;
for example, to provide systematic continuing information about the rate of&#13;
unemployment amongst :Leavers from vocational education programs in a small&#13;
subregion of the country.   Too often manpower analysts and others are tempted&#13;
to  make   up  some  plausible   numbers,   rather  than  to   simply   tell  the&#13;
decision-maker  that no   reliable  information  can be provieled.    Though  the&#13;
analyst may attach warnings about the uncertainty of these numbers, in the&#13;
process of communication amongst various groups the warnings quickly become&#13;
detached from the numbers.&#13;
iii. Studies of a Narrow Skill Group&#13;
Finally, it must be recognized that there are situations which will&#13;
arise which call for highly specialized sorts of manpower analysis. A current&#13;
example is the problem of supply and demand for comput:er programmers,&#13;
technicians and systems analysts. While it has been apparent for at least two&#13;
decades that computerization of many information handling processes was going&#13;
to become increasingly widespread, few people predicted that the costs of&#13;
large scale data handling would fall at the precipitous rates they have over&#13;
the last 5 to 10 years.     Thus it would have been difficult to predict that&#13;
computing costs would fall sufficiently for middle income level countries&#13;
(such as Malaysia) to expect computer usage to become quite widespread both&#13;
within the government and the private sector.      In the short run,   the sharp&#13;
increase in demand with relatively limited supply in such a market will lead&#13;
to a lot of "churning" (that is, rapid job switching) in the market for these&#13;
skills as various employers, public and private, bid for these scarce&#13;
resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
A special manpower analysis in this situation might help in several&#13;
ways. First, as has been suggested at several points above, various parts of&#13;
the public sector are likely to suffer in competition for these scarce&#13;
resources to the extent that they lack the flexibility to respond to shifts in&#13;
wage and benefit competition.      In an extreme    short run shortage situation&#13;
non-price rationing is often resorted to.        I am very hesitant    to suggest&#13;
rationing mechanisms both because a human resource is involved and because the&#13;
experience with bureaucratic rationing in general is not very happy. However,&#13;
to the extent the public sector can slow the pace of increase in demand and&#13;
establish some priorities it may be able to reduce the amount of inefficient&#13;
"churning" engendered by the short run shortage.       In the area of computing,&#13;
this "churning" is particularly destructive because when the expert leaves&#13;
before the system is adequately documented the whole system development can be&#13;
rendered almost useless. Simple instruction can help departments to learn how&#13;
to conserve   on  the  use  of  these  scarce  resources;   for  example,  skilled&#13;
programmers can be freed from low level data input and output tasks through a&#13;
very small amount of training of regular staff.&#13;
For the longer run, there is certain to be a supply response to the&#13;
sharp improvement in opportunities in the computer field. The contribution of&#13;
manpower analysis then is to develop a system for monitoring developments in&#13;
this area which will provide regular information about the status of the labor&#13;
market   in  computer   skills.   The  adjustment   of  supply   and  demand  will&#13;
undoubtedly not be smooth; supply increases will lag' for a while and then&#13;
probably overshoot and exceed demand - several such cycles have been&#13;
experienced in the computer programmer market in the United States.          It is&#13;
unlikely, however, that any manpower planning or analysis can completely avoid&#13;
such bumpy adjustments. In this case the loss to individuals and society from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
having occasional periods of "too much" training of computer specialists is&#13;
not likely to be great because the skills are likely to prove useful to a&#13;
major degree in areas just over the boundaries of computer science, e.g., to&#13;
management  administration on one side and to engineering       sciences  on the&#13;
other.   By providing good feedback information on the state of the market,&#13;
manpower analysts cain help to reduce the size of the bumps in the adjustment&#13;
process.&#13;
7. DATA NEEDS&#13;
It has been stressed at several points in this paper, as well as in&#13;
the other papers in this volume, that solid manpower analysis and planning can&#13;
only be done as a regularized, continuing process.     While as suggested in the&#13;
previous section, for some topics special one-time data collection efforts are&#13;
necessary, it is important not to let these dominate the analysis and planning&#13;
activities.&#13;
In most colntries,   regularly collected labor force data have been&#13;
gathered from both households (the Labour Force Survey) and establishments&#13;
(the Monthly Industrial Statistics, Census/Survey of Manufacturing, Quarterly&#13;
Survey of Employment in Manufacturing).     These are the sources which can be&#13;
most  readily utilized   to monitor developments    in  the  labor market.    The&#13;
effective utilisation of these data can be considerably enhanced if they can&#13;
be provided to the manpower analysis group as raw micro-data files, but this&#13;
is a capability which relatively few developing countries appear to have&#13;
developed.&#13;
In understanding manpower movements in the labor market, information&#13;
on relative earnings may be of great importance.      Such information can come&#13;
either from household surveys or from establishment surveys on wages or&#13;
earnings. While most: countries have had some of these types of data, their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
collection has been, in general, fragmentary and uncoordinated.     As a result,&#13;
when analysts do try to work with earnings and wage data they find themselves&#13;
spending enormous amounts of time trying to deal with inconsistencies across&#13;
data sources, especially when trying to develop a picture of changes over&#13;
time. Thus, better organization and utilization of these types of data should&#13;
be a high priority.&#13;
In addition to employment, wage and earnings data, insights on the&#13;
operation of the labor market in the private sector can be gained by regularly&#13;
collected information from firms regarding labor turnover-hires, fires, quits,&#13;
promotions.   These data are particularly useful if wage data are collected&#13;
along with them.&#13;
It was noted at several points above that the public sector is the&#13;
predominant employer for many types of manpower and that it could make an&#13;
important contribution by organizing its own employment and earnings records&#13;
in a consistent fashion and in forms which might be readily accessible for&#13;
manpower analysts.&#13;
There are other types of data that are regularly collected for&#13;
administrative purposes which can be tapped for manpower analysis purposes.&#13;
Education system and social security system records are two such sources&#13;
already mentioned above and health records may also be useful. Where problems&#13;
concerning overseas education and flows of emigrants and immigrants are a&#13;
concern, organization of regularized data on these flows by immigration&#13;
service authorities might be considered.&#13;
For education in particular, in addition to the regular data sources&#13;
reviewed above, the development of more tracer studies will contribute more to&#13;
effective manpower analysis of educational activities than any other type of&#13;
data collection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

8. WHAT ROLE-FOR THE DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE AGENCIES?&#13;
So far in this paper the types of manpower analysis which might be&#13;
undertaken by units within the goverment of a developing country in order to&#13;
improve  economic  and  educational  policy-making  have   been  outlined.   This&#13;
really amounts to little more than a list of potential activities and few&#13;
priorities have been indicated, methods of analysis explicated or substantive&#13;
analytic conclusions presented.    This is in part purposeful since one of the&#13;
implications of the perspective I have suggested is that the priorities and&#13;
methods must be adapted to the specific circumstances of a given country&#13;
rather than set down as a rigid pattern all must follow.         In addition, of&#13;
course,  it would be outside the scope of this paper to undertake detailed&#13;
descriptions of methods.    It does seem reasonable, however, to try to follow&#13;
up this outline of possible tasks for manpower analysts in developing&#13;
countries with some attempt to indicate what steps the Development Assistance&#13;
Agencies might take to increase the likelihood that the sort of useful&#13;
manpower analysis outlined above will) in fact, be undertaken.&#13;
In his paper in this volume C.R.S. Dougherty has made a fundamental&#13;
point about the Development Assistance Agencies' role.       He argues that the&#13;
predominant procedures of the lending agencies-centered on a discrete project&#13;
approach - are likely to be antithetical to the development: of an improved,&#13;
continuous manpower   *nalysis  capability   in  the borrower   countries.   This&#13;
observation has very substantial and serious implications for what the&#13;
Agencies ought to do if they hope to contribute to the development of useful&#13;
manpower analysis.   Atu Dougherty develops the implications of this insight in&#13;
some detail, they are not repeated here.      However, some observations from a&#13;
slightly different perspective are made which attempt to reinforce the&#13;
argument.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
A. Changes in Development Assistance Agencies' Procedures&#13;
i.   The "Quick-fix" Bias&#13;
The emphasis on discreet projects which Dougherty identifies appears&#13;
to have had the effect of making members of Development Assistance Agencies'&#13;
missions feel that there should be a prescribed manpower analysis methodology&#13;
whith can be relati:vely quickly applied in order to justify, alter or reject a&#13;
given project proposal in the education-training domain.       This pressure is&#13;
transmitted to the borrowers and reinforces their predisposition to engage in&#13;
simplified formalistic projection exercises which are of little value.     A high&#13;
priority should be put upon making it clear that there is no set of&#13;
"quick-fix" methods which are either necessary or sufficient in themselves for&#13;
project justification.&#13;
ii. Phased Development, Evaluation and Experimentation&#13;
From the manpower perspective on education, the impact of educational&#13;
programs is reflected in what happens to the graduates of (or dropouts from)&#13;
education programs in the labor market.     Since our understanding of the way&#13;
labor markets actually operate in developing countries is so limited, we&#13;
cannot predict a priori with much confidence what will actually happen to&#13;
those  leaving a given education or training      program.   This suggests   that&#13;
evaluation of the effects of a given program is an important ingredient for&#13;
improved program planning.&#13;
An emphasis on evaluation only makes sense if there is an intention&#13;
to base subsequent program decisions at least in part on the information&#13;
provided  by   the  evaluation.    This,   in  turn,   suggests  phased   project&#13;
development in which evaluation of outcomes at the first stages can influence&#13;
the secondary stages of the project development.      For these reasons, phased&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
project development wil:h a compulsory, funded evaluation component may be a&#13;
more desirable way of developing education and training programs than discrete&#13;
project  development  based   only  on  a  priori  project   justification.   The&#13;
evaluation component increases the probability that over time there is&#13;
learning from experience and it is more consistent with the kind of continuous&#13;
manpower analysis and planning effort advocated by the papers in this volume.&#13;
It should be stressed that what is needed is carefully designed&#13;
quantitative evaluation, not the older style of evaluation based upon casual&#13;
observation and commentary by experts.     In the 1970s considerable experience&#13;
was accumulated in the developed countries, especially the Unit:ed States, with&#13;
quantitative   evaluations  of  public  programs   and  the  lessons   from  this&#13;
experience could be usefully transferred to those in borrowing countries&#13;
through  the  Development   Assistance  Agencies.   If  quantitative   evaluation&#13;
elements were built into phased project development in some projects financed&#13;
by  the   Development  Assistance  Agencies,   adoption  of   these  quantitative&#13;
evaluation techniques would undoubtedly proceed more rapidly.&#13;
The most powerful method of quantitative program evaluation is&#13;
through use   of  an  experimental  design.    An  experimental  design  requires&#13;
persons be randomly assigned to various types of training and to a control&#13;
group that receives no training. Then all groups are followed Eor a period of&#13;
time  (reinterviewed)  and  the  outcomes  compared.    The  addition  of  random&#13;
assignment to an otherwise standard quantitative evaluation can considerably&#13;
increase  the  power  to  measure   impacts.   There  were   some  very  sizeable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
experiments with social programs in the United States in the 1970s so that&#13;
there is now some substantial experience with implementing such projects in&#13;
the developed country context. 5/&#13;
Aside from a few possible examples in population programs, I am aware&#13;
of no uses of experimental designs for evaluation of social programs in&#13;
developing   countries.    Development   Assistance   Agencies   could   seriously&#13;
consider   the   implementation   of   phased   projects   using   this   sort  of&#13;
experimental-evaluation design.&#13;
iii. Direct Support for Data Improvement and Manpower Analysis&#13;
There is a considerable amount that can be done to assist developing&#13;
countries to improve the collection of data to be used in manpower analyses.&#13;
As indicated in the section on data collection above, there are substantial&#13;
regularly collected data which could be used for manpower analysis but are&#13;
often not used because of lack of co-ordination and an inability of central&#13;
statistical offices to provide data in a unaggregated, micro-unit form.         The&#13;
rapid decline in computing costs has made it feasible for virtually any&#13;
ministry in a developing country to have computing facilities of considerable&#13;
power.   The major stumbling block now is the provision of data in forms which&#13;
lend themselves to computerized analysis and the training of staff to use&#13;
standard statistical analysis packages.&#13;
5/ See for example R. Ferber and W. Hirsch [1982] for a description of this&#13;
experience and articles by Cook and McAnany and by Hollister in R. Klein,&#13;
et. al. [1979] for the relevance of the United States' experience to&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -&#13;
As Dougherty has suggested, direct support for an ongoing manpower&#13;
analysis and planning group would be the best way to facilitate improved&#13;
manpower   planning.   In  addition,   funding  for   projects  to   improve  and&#13;
co-ordinate regular data collection as just suggested would considerably&#13;
enhance the opportunities for good analysis and monitoring of education and&#13;
labor markets.&#13;
B. Special Studies and Technical Assistance&#13;
While changes in Development Assistance Agencies processes suggested&#13;
above are likely to produce the greatest contribution to improved manpower&#13;
planning, there can be little doubt that it will be difficult to make them.&#13;
It is perhaps useful, icherefore, to suggest types of special studies which the&#13;
Development Assistance Agencies could initiate and technical assistance they&#13;
might provide.&#13;
i.   Studies and Guidelines for Methods&#13;
Manpower analysts in developing countries will in general be most&#13;
helped not by studies which make substantive conclusions about policies, e.g.&#13;
about the efficacy of education in raising farmer's productivity, as by those&#13;
which provide guidance as to how best to implement the types of studies which&#13;
will ultimately yield insights as to the effects of policies and programs in&#13;
their country.    Thus rather than a survey of whether vocational education&#13;
appears in general to yield benefits greater than costs, studies which seek to&#13;
define what types of data need to be collected, how best they are collected,&#13;
and how they can be rapidly processed and analyzed will contribute most to&#13;
improved manpower planning. Promoting, collecting and disseminating exemplary&#13;
studies is of course cine important way of achieving this end.     The following&#13;
are some examples:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
a.   Tracer studies - Promotion of this kind of study could be enhanced by&#13;
a careful review of alternative designs, types of questionnaires,&#13;
reviews of implementation problems, examples of types of analyses and&#13;
indications of where they have fallen short.&#13;
b.   Central data collection - Strategies for improving the co-ordination&#13;
and utilization of regularly collected data to increase their use for&#13;
manpower   analysis   could   be   reviewed.    Methods   of  obtaining&#13;
disaggregated   data  could   be  described.    Examples   of  uses   of&#13;
administrative records could be collected and disseminated.&#13;
c.   Analysis  of wage   and  labor market   turnover   data  - Examples   of&#13;
analyses using various types of wage, earnings and labor market&#13;
turnover data could be collected and disseminated along with&#13;
discussions of problems in analysis.&#13;
ii. Policy Studies&#13;
There are some topics which are best illuminated, at least initially,&#13;
by reviews of the literature. The following are examples:&#13;
a.   A study of the effectiveness of policies to promote industry training&#13;
through industry training tax schemes - Though these programs have&#13;
been adopted in several countries there seems to be no thorough&#13;
review of information about their effectiveness.&#13;
b.   Manpower problems in the construction sector - This is another topic&#13;
that comes up repeatedly in developing countries for which there&#13;
appears to be no systematic studies.&#13;
c.   International migrations of middle level manpower       - As   suggested&#13;
above, a study of this problem and some of the policy options for&#13;
dealing with it might prove useful for several developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
d.   Agricultural  manpower   - There  seems  to be   a lack of    systematic&#13;
studies of the agricultural manpower configurations associated with&#13;
various types of crop production.&#13;
9. A REPRISE&#13;
Given   the  state   of   the  art   of  manpower   planning   and   the&#13;
characteristics of their economies, the developing countries would be best&#13;
served by a program which put less emphasis on manpower projections and more&#13;
emphasis on manpower analysis of the operation of various aspects of the labor&#13;
market at all skill levels.     It is very important at the outset of such a&#13;
program to try to foster lower and different expectations about what manpower&#13;
planning and analysis are likely to be able to, and should, provide;&#13;
authorities in the education and training sector must be made to understand&#13;
that planners will not be able to tell them exactly how much and which types&#13;
of manpower are requirEd by a given date.      It is important that they feel a&#13;
greater responsibility to find out what happens to their own graduates, and&#13;
whether and why they "succeed" or "fail" in their subsequent work experience.&#13;
As part of the manpower analysis greater effort should be made to&#13;
study  the  incentives  which  operate  in various   labor markets,   how people&#13;
respond to them or what: constrains them from responding.     Wage differentials&#13;
are only the most obvious of such incentives; other benefits, perceived career&#13;
opportunities and associated amenities also require attention.&#13;
Getting a clearer picture of the extent and cause of mobility both&#13;
among jobs and across geographic locations will help clarify just how flexible&#13;
the labor market institutions have been and are likely to be and, therefore,&#13;
how quickly they can be counted on to respond to shifting demand and supply in&#13;
various markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
A major contribution to these sorts of analyses can be made by the&#13;
public  sector  through  development   of  two  sorts  of data   system:   first,&#13;
consistent  micro-data   on   the  manpower   in   its  employ   covering   their&#13;
characteristics, how they are utilized and paid; second, working up from&#13;
project planning, data on major new public sector initiatives and the types of&#13;
manpower demands they are likely to create.&#13;
Beyond these generalizations and a few specific suggestions, it seems&#13;
to me that the development of manpower analysis must proceed sector by sector,&#13;
shaping the types of analysis to the particular types of manpower problems&#13;
which arise in each sector.    This will clearly require a continuous manpower&#13;
analysis and planning activity based on regularly collected data.&#13;
With respect to the steps the Development Assistance Agencies might&#13;
take to foster better manpower planning and analysis, more emphasis should be&#13;
put, in educational and training projects, on phased project development with&#13;
a systematic quantitative evaluation or experimental design being part of the&#13;
project phases.&#13;

            Manpower issues in educational investment :
            a consideration of planning processes and techniques
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Three papers discuss issues related to
            manpower analysis and educational investment in developing
            countries. The authors suggest a broader approach to the
            analysis of the relationship between manpower and the
            educational system than has traditionally been used. The
            major contention is that forcing all manpower questions into
            any single analytical framework will result in low quality
            analysis and low quality educational investments, and
            therefore, a wide range of techniques is advocated. In
            addition, an argument is made for the need for continuity of
            manpower analysis through the development of a planning
            process which goes well beyond the identification and
            preparation of a specific education project. The
            construction and repetition of an annual routine to monitor
            conditions in the labor market would provide a regular set
            of relevant signals to a wide range of decision makers in
            the education and training sector. The papers do not provide
            a new blueprint for manpower analysis but review the present
            situation, advocate a well-structured planning process, and
            suggest the wide range of analytic approaches available and
            necessary for improved analysis.
