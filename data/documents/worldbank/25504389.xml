&amp;#12;    OVERVIEW&#13;
    Global economic prospects&#13;
    Global growth remained weak in the first half of the year on account of a further slowdown in emerging&#13;
    markets and a weaker recovery in advanced economies. While purchasing managers index surveys suggest&#13;
    a moderately positive outlook in high-income countries, they point to a contraction in low- and middle-income&#13;
    countries. Growth in advanced economies is expected to increase modestly next year, with firmer growth especially&#13;
    in the Euro area and Japan. Meanwhile, prospects for developing economies remain challenging due to a weak&#13;
    outlook for commodity exporters, tightening capital flows, and still subdued trade growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Recent economic developments in Vietnam&#13;
    Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s economy has weathered the recent turbulence in the external environment fairly well, reflecting&#13;
    resilient domestic demand and robust performance of export-oriented manufacturing. Growth further&#13;
    accelerated to 6.5 percent (year-on-year) in the first three quarters of 2015 (after coming in at 6 percent last&#13;
    year). Low inflation and strengthening consumer confidence supported an uptick in private consumption while&#13;
    investment was lifted by robust foreign direct investment, rising government capital expenditures, and a recovery&#13;
    of credit growth. Exports of the foreign-invested manufacturing sector also accelerated, but this was offset by a&#13;
    slowdown of commodity exports and a surge in imports of capital and intermediate goods, reflecting stronger&#13;
    investment and the high import content of manufacturing exports.&#13;
&#13;
    Against the backdrop of low inflation, monetary policy remains accommodative. Reflecting lower oil and food&#13;
    prices and stable core inflation, headline consumer price inflation is at historical lows. Average inflation stood at&#13;
    0.7 percent in the first ten months of 2015, down from 4.6 percent in the same period last year. Energy inflation&#13;
    is easing, thanks to lower international oil prices, which have been pushing fuel and transport prices down. Food&#13;
    inflation also remains lower this year, growing just 1.6 percent in the first nine months of 2015. While there has&#13;
    been no further monetary easing this year, credit growth has picked up markedly, coming in at around 12 percent&#13;
    (year-to-date) in September 2015 â&#128;&#147; the largest expansion since 2011.&#13;
&#13;
    Amid volatility in international currency markets, rising exchange rate pressures were alleviated by gradual&#13;
    devaluation. Pressures on the currency had been building since early 2015 on account of a rising trade deficit and&#13;
    weakening currencies across Asia, putting pressure on the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) to follow suit to mitigate&#13;
    the Dongâ&#128;&#153;s relative strength. The SBV accordingly devalued the Dong reference rate by a cumulative 3 percent&#13;
    and by widening the trading band from +/-1% to +/-3%. This helped preserve currency market stability, but in&#13;
    the context of sharper depreciations of major currencies against the US dollar, concerns of real exchange rate&#13;
    appreciation against currencies of major trading partners remain.&#13;
&#13;
    Better macroeconomic conditions helped maintain stability in the banking system, but deep seated&#13;
    vulnerabilities continue to pose risks. Reported systemwide non-performing loans have declined to about 3&#13;
    percent of total loans, due to transfers of NPLs to the Vietnam Asset Management Company (VAMC) and an&#13;
    uptick in credit growth. But the resolution of distressed assets has been slow, and only around 7 percent of the&#13;
    bad debts were resolved. Progress in this areas is hampered by the VAMCâ&#128;&#153;s lack of legal ownership of bad assets,&#13;
    the absence of an adequate enabling legal framework for insolvency, asset titling, and collateral seizures, and the&#13;
    personal liability of VAMC staff for selling assets for less than their book value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6     TAKING STOCK An Update on Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s Recent Economic Developments&#13;
&amp;#12;Fiscal consolidation remains crucial to contain risks to fiscal sustainability. Fiscal pressures remained acute&#13;
during the first nine months of the year. A combination of declining oil revenue and a further corporate income&#13;
tax (CIT) rate cut dampened revenue performance. At the same time, expenditure expanded at a faster rate than&#13;
revenue, driven mostly by an increase in recurrent spending. In the first nine months of 2015, the fiscal deficit was&#13;
estimated at 4.9 percent of GDP (excluding off-budget activity), financed primarily by domestic debt. Maintaining&#13;
the current fiscal stance would result in the accumulation of public-sector debt, which would create risks in terms&#13;
of breaching the legal limit of 65 percent of GDP in the medium term.&#13;
&#13;
On the external front, Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s export performance remains strong. Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s total export turnover increased&#13;
by 9.2 percent from the same period last year. While primary commodity exports fell significantly under the weight&#13;
of low commodity prices, manufacturing exports continued to grow robustly thanks to the strong performance&#13;
of manufacturing exports, especially in such technology categories as cell phones, electronics, and computers.&#13;
Meanwhile, imports, especially of capital goods, continued to surge, reflecting the uptick in investment activity&#13;
and the high import content of some of Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s exports. Overall, Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s trade position weakened during&#13;
2015, narrowing the current account surplus. Even with the weaker current account and fairly low reserves,&#13;
external financing risks were mitigated by robust FDI inflows and limited exposure to portfolio capital flows.&#13;
&#13;
Implementing structural reforms continues along a gradual path. Although the pace of the equitization process&#13;
has picked up, but many transaction involve divestment of minority shares, hampering the expected impact on&#13;
investment and enterprise performance. Meanwhile, Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s ranking in the Doing Business survey has risen&#13;
from 93rd in DB2015 to 90th in DB2016 among 189 economies. But its competitiveness is still ranked below the&#13;
average for the ASEAN-4 countries, with slow improvements in infrastructure, the institutional framework, and&#13;
the business environment. Highlighted are problems with tax payment times, protections for minority investors,&#13;
access to electricity, and dealing with business insolvency. In 2015 the government also made further progress&#13;
in improving the business climate with the issuance of resolution 19/NQ-CP/2015, which aims to lower the tax&#13;
payment period to 121.5 hours/year 7 and rapidly decrease processing times for clearing exports and imports of&#13;
goods to 13 and 14 days, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Outlook&#13;
The medium-term outlook for Vietnam remains positive. GDP growth is expected to stay at around 6.5 percent&#13;
in 2015, underpinned by further recovery in domestic demand, in turn reflecting robust private consumption&#13;
and investment growth. Growth is projected to strengthen further over the medium term. Inflation is expected&#13;
to remain low on account of low global energy and food prices before rebounding somewhat in medium term.&#13;
The trade balance is projected to narrow significantly this year due to a combination of moderating exports and&#13;
sustained import growth stoked by stronger domestic economic activity. Robust remittances will keep the current&#13;
account in surplus, if at much lower level than last year. External capital inflows are expected to cover balance-&#13;
of-payment financing needs as Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s favorable economic prospects usher in additional FDI. The fiscal deficit&#13;
is expected to remain high this year, but adjust starting next year due to consolidation efforts to avoid further&#13;
increases in public debt.&#13;
&#13;
While the baseline outlook for Vietnam is positive on balance, downside risks dominate. On the domestic&#13;
front, slow structural reform progress poses significant risks to the medium-term growth prospects. Delays&#13;
in implementing fiscal consolidation could undermine debt sustainability, especially given contingent liabilities&#13;
associated with SOE debt and state-owned banks. With credit growth accelerating, risks in the banking sector,&#13;
including possible overheating, are also intensifying andâ&#128;&#148;if not managed prudentlyâ&#128;&#148;could result in renewed&#13;
instability. On the external front, slower-than-expected growth in key export markets, notably the US, EU, Japan,&#13;
and China, may pose a risk to export performance and growth. In addition, the anticipated policy rate liftoff in the&#13;
United States may cause sovereign spreads to rise, a concern for Vietnam given its large gross public financing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;    needs, which are expected to be met at least partly by international bond issuances. Against the backdrop of&#13;
    these uncertainties, sound macroeconomic management remains crucial to rebuild policy buffers and safeguard&#13;
    against future shocks. Fiscal consolidation, structural reforms, a more flexible exchange rate, and a further build-&#13;
    up of reserves could help reduce the vulnerabilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Special topic: The Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement&#13;
    The TPP is expected to generate considerable benefits for Vietnam. Among the current TPP signatories,&#13;
    Vietnamâ&#128;&#148;as the economy with the lowest per capita GDPâ&#128;&#148;has unique comparative advantages, particularly in&#13;
    labor-intensive manufacturing. By enhancing access to key export markets, the TPP is expected to create trade&#13;
    diversion since Vietnamese exports would be expected to replace an increasing share of Chinese exports to TPP&#13;
    markets, notably the US and Japan â&#128;&#147; a trend already started even before the TPPâ&#128;&#153;s conclusion. The TPP is also&#13;
    expected to lead to further increases in (already considerable) FDI inflows to build up export capacity, including&#13;
    that in upstream suppliers to sectors subject to strict rules of origin. By contrast, higher environmental and labor&#13;
    requirements may raise the costs of production in Vietnam, at least in the sort-run.&#13;
&#13;
    On the economic impacts, simulations suggest that the TPP could add as much as 8 percent to Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
    GDP , 17 percent to its real exports, and 12 percent to its capital stock over the next 20 years. About half the&#13;
    benefits are generated by tariff reductions and half by non-tariff measures (NTMs), including the liberalization of&#13;
    key service sectors. Labor-intensive manufacturing and especially sectors that currently face high import tariffs in&#13;
    the TPP markets will benefit most. These include textile, apparel, and footwear and to less extent food processing&#13;
    and electronics. In contrast, primary export sectors, including agriculture and services, are expected to decline&#13;
    mainly as a result of accelerated structural transformation (with production factors reallocating to manufacturing).&#13;
&#13;
    While the impact of the TPP on Vietnam is expected to be positive, implementation challenges remain. The&#13;
    TPP is expected to serve as an external anchor for structural reforms. It is not only removing trade barriers and&#13;
    enhancing market access to key export markets, but it will also have tangible impacts on regulatory quality,&#13;
    intellectual property rights, investor protection, competition, SOE management, labor and environmental&#13;
    standards, food safety, public procurement and the liberalization of services, including financial services and&#13;
    telecommunications. Implementing these commitments will be particularly challenging for Vietnamâ&#128;&#148;given its&#13;
    gradual reform path and institutional legacies, such as a large SOE sector and incomplete market institutions. But&#13;
    it has shown in its accession to the WTO that it can leverage external commitments to advance domestic reforms,&#13;
    especially in challenging areas. To make the most of the opportunities, implementing TPP commitments could&#13;
    be accompanied by further steps to enhance Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s competitiveness, investing in roads, power, ports, and&#13;
    logistics services and enhancing the efficiency of border clearance procedures.&#13;

     2.		 Growth in developing East Asia and Pacific (EAP) countries eased over the first half of the year. This&#13;
     mostly reflected a gradual slowdown in China, stemming from policy efforts to tighten nonbank credit and from a&#13;
     buildup of excess industrial capacity and decelerating exports. Looking ahead, growth in developing EAP is expected&#13;
     to ease, from 6.8 percent in 2014 to 6.5 percent in 2015 and 6.3 percent over 2016â&#128;&#147;17. Aggregate growth in the&#13;
     Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) economies will be roughly stable at 4.3 percent in 2015, rising to&#13;
     4.9 percent by 2017, with increasing support from global growth and export demand, particularly from high-income&#13;
     economies. Over the medium term, regional growth will be conditioned by accelerating demand in high-income&#13;
     economies, gradually tightening external financing conditions, and still-subdued international commodity prices.&#13;
&#13;
     3.		 Risks to the global outlook remain tilted to the downside. Major downside risks are centered on Chinaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     transition to slower, less investment driven growth, weak commodity prices, potential capital flow reversals,&#13;
     and rising external financing costs. Sharp asset price adjustments, financial turmoil and sharper-than-expected&#13;
     increases in borrowing costs in response to an expected hike in the U.S. Federal Reserveâ&#128;&#153;s rate could also take&#13;
     a toll on global activity, especially among developing economies. And crisis legacies, including high public debt&#13;
     ratios and private debt overhang, could weigh on the recovery in high income economies.&#13;

10         TAKING STOCK An Update on Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s Recent Economic Developments&#13;
&amp;#12;4.		 The strengthening recovery in high-income economies should further boost Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s already strong&#13;
export performance. But strong trade linkages expose Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s economy to a possible slowdown in global&#13;
growth, especially in the United Statesâ&#128;&#148;its main export market. Heightened exchange rate volatility poses a&#13;
risk against the backdrop of Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s still limited exchange rate flexibility, weakening current account and low&#13;
external reserve coverage. In addition, the anticipated policy rate liftoff in the United States is expected to cause&#13;
sovereign spreads to rise in the international capital market. This could be a concern to Vietnam, given its large&#13;
gross public financing needs, which are expected to be partially met by international bond issuances. These risks&#13;
call for a continuing focus on sound macroeconomic management to mitigate external and fiscal vulnerabilities.&#13;
With limited scope for countercyclical fiscal and monetary policy, macroeconomic policies will need to begin&#13;
adjusting to rebuild policy buffers to safeguard against future shocks. Fiscal consolidation, structural reforms, a&#13;
more flexible exchange rate, and a further build-up of reserves could help reduce the vulnerabilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I.2. Recent Economic Developments in Vietnam&#13;
I. 2.1. Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s economic recovery has been resilient in the face of external volatility&#13;
&#13;
5.		 Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s economy has weathered recent turbulence in the external environment fairly well,&#13;
reflecting resilient domestic demand and robust export-oriented manufacturing. After a slowdown during&#13;
2012 and 2013, growth started to recover to 6 percent in 2014 and further accelerated to 6.5 percent (year-&#13;
on-year) in first three quarters of 2015. Low inflation and strengthening consumer confidence supported an&#13;
uptick in private consumption while investment was lifted by robust foreign direct investment, rising government&#13;
expenditures marking completion of the current five-year planning cycle, and a recovery of credit growth. In the&#13;
first nine months of 2015, total investment is up 8.5 percent compared with the same period last year. Exports of&#13;
foreign-invested manufacturing also accelerated, but this was offset by a slowdown of commodity exports and a&#13;
surge in imports of capital and intermediate goods, reflecting stronger investment and the high import content of&#13;
manufacturing exports.&#13;
&#13;
6.		 On the production side, growth was led by industry, which benefitted from strong foreign-invested&#13;
manufacturing and construction owing to a gradual recovery in the property market and higher investment.&#13;
Service performance also picked up, growing by 6.2 percent thanks to buoyant retail sales (up 9.1 percent, y/y),&#13;
only partially offset by slowing growth in the tourism sector (down to 3.8 percent, y/y). In contrast, agricultural&#13;
production slowed (to 2.1 percent, y/y), reflecting lower food prices and less favorable climatic conditions related&#13;
to El Nino.&#13;

&amp;#12;     7.		 Reflecting lower oil and food prices and stable core inflation, headline consumer price inflation has&#13;
     moderated. Average inflation stood at 0.7 percent in the first ten months of 2015, down from 4.6 percent in the&#13;
     same period last year. Energy inflation is easing, thanks to lower international oil prices, which have been pushing&#13;
     fuel and transport prices down. Food inflation also remains lower this year, growing just 1.6 percent in the first&#13;
     nine months of 2015.&#13;
&#13;
     I.2.2. Credit growth is resuming, supported by low inflation and accommodative monetary policy&#13;
&#13;
     8.	 	 Low inflation has provided scope for accommodative monetary policy. Against the backdrop of declining&#13;
     inflation and weak domestic demand, the SBV has cut its policy rates by a cumulative 850 basis points since&#13;
     2012, including a 50 basis point reduction in October 2014. The discount rate and refinancing rate now stand at&#13;
     4.5 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively. Concurrently, the SBV also relaxed macro prudential measures with&#13;
     Circular 36 (issued in November 2014), which increased the lending limit on short-term deposits (to 60 percent&#13;
     from 30 percent) and lowered risk weights for certain lending activities, including real estate loans. While there&#13;
     has been no further monetary easing this year, credit growth has picked up markedly, coming in at around 12&#13;
     percent (year-to-date) in September 2015â&#128;&#148;the highest expansion since 2011. Although supporting investment&#13;
     growth, the resumption of faster credit growth raises concerns over asset quality, particularly given the unresolved&#13;
     balance sheet risks related to bad debts accumulated during previous years.&#13;

     9.	        Better macroeconomic conditions have helped maintain stability in the banking system, though&#13;
     deep-seated vulnerabilities continue to pose risks. While reported system-wide non-performing loans have&#13;
     declined to about 3 percent of total loans, some of the decline is due to transfers of NPLs to the Vietnam Asset&#13;
     Management Company (VAMC), which has purchased VND 226 trillion (roughly USD 10 billion) of bad debts as&#13;
     of October 2015. The VAMC purchased these distressed assets in exchange for VAMC bonds. So far, around 7&#13;
     percent of the bad debts were resolved either through selling of the debts or their underlying collaterals. Further&#13;
     progress has been hampered by a lack of legal ownership of bad assets by the VAMC, the absence of an adequate&#13;
     enabling legal framework for insolvency, asset titling, and collateral seizures, and the personal liability of VAMC&#13;
     staff for selling assets for less than their book value.&#13;
&#13;
     I.2.3. Exchange rate pressures were alleviated by gradual devaluation&#13;
&#13;
     10.	      Amid volatility in international currency markets, rising exchange rate pressures were alleviated by&#13;
     a gradual devaluation and more exchange rate flexibility. Vietnam continues to operate a crawling peg system,&#13;
     with the exchange rate as the main nominal policy anchor. Pressures on the currency had been building since&#13;
     early 2015 on account of a rising trade deficit and weakening currencies across Asia. These pressures were&#13;
     exacerbated by the depreciation of the Chinese renminbi in early August. Reluctant to raise interest rates and with&#13;

&amp;#12;limited forex reserves at its disposal (less than three months of import cover), the SBV responded by devaluing&#13;
the dong three times, in January, May, and August 2015 by a cumulative 3 percentâ&#128;&#148;and by widening the trading&#13;
band from +/-1% to +/-3%. Overall in 2015, the dong fell by about 5 percent against the US dollar in nominal&#13;
terms or roughly 3 percent in real terms. The SBV also lowered the deposit rate for US dollars and tightened the&#13;
foreign currency transactions of credit institutions to avoid speculation and hoarding of the US dollar. This helped&#13;
preserve currency market stability and ward off pressures on export competitiveness.&#13;

I.2.4. Fiscal consolidation remains important&#13;
&#13;
11.	       A combination of declining oil revenue and a further CIT rate cut dampened revenue performance&#13;
in the first nine months of 2015. Oil revenue fell by 35 percent (year-on-year) while corporate income tax (CIT)&#13;
and trade tax receipts were down 19 percent and 2 percent, respectively, due to further reduction in tax rates.&#13;
Among key taxes, the value added tax (VAT), which makes up around a third of total tax revenue, increased 15&#13;
percent (year-on-year) thanks to strong private consumption. Personal income tax (PIT) collections increased&#13;
by 18 percent thanks to an expanded tax base. Overall revenue increased by around 7 percent in nominal terms&#13;
compared with the same period last year.&#13;

&amp;#12;     12.	      Expenditure expanded faster than revenue, driven mostly by an increase in recurrent spending,&#13;
     which accounted for 70.5 percent of total expenditure. During the first nine months, total expenditure was 7.8&#13;
     percent higher than in the same period last year, with recurrent and capital spending (excluding off-budget items)&#13;
     increasing by 5.6 and 7.6 percent, respectively. Debt service payments from the state budget (both principal&#13;
     and interest) rose 12.6 percent, reflecting an increased public debt burden. But the share of capital spending in&#13;
     total expenditure (on-budget only) declined to 15.6 percent of total spending in the first nine months of 2015,&#13;
     compared with an average of 26.5 percent over 2011â&#128;&#147;2014.&#13;
&#13;
     13.	       In the first nine months of 2015, the fiscal deficit was estimated at 4.9 percent of GDP (government&#13;
     definition), financed primarily by domestic debt. Note that this does not include off-budget capital spending,&#13;
     which means that the overall deficit in the first nine months was likely higher. Due to regulations set by the National&#13;
     Assembly last year restricting debt issuance of less than five years maturity, the Ministry of Finance has faced&#13;
     difficulties in issuing Treasury bonds. In the first nine months of 2015, the State Treasury issued just 127 trillion&#13;
     dong of Treasury bonds (about 51 percent of the annual plan), down 39 percent year-on-year. The MOF borrowed&#13;
     VND 30 trillion from the SBV in the form of short-term monetary financing. This may offset efforts at lowering the&#13;
     cost of borrowing by administratively restricting Treasury bond issuances.&#13;
&#13;
     14.	     Growing fiscal imbalances resulting from countercyclical fiscal policy in past years need to be&#13;
     addressed to ensure sustainable public finances. The government is seeking to strengthen fiscal discipline by&#13;
     improving tax administration and broadening the tax base. Efforts are also afoot to rein in growth of recurrent&#13;
     spending and further tighten controls over new public investment projects. The revised State Budget Law offers&#13;
     important opportunities to further strengthen fiscal management.&#13;
&#13;
     15.	       Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s public-debt-to-GDP ratio has increased rapidly over the past few years. While Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     overall fiscal stance has been countercyclical, sizable fiscal deficits raise concerns about the medium-term&#13;
     sustainability of the current fiscal position and corresponding public debt path. The Ministry of Finance reported&#13;
     that Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s total public debt (government, government-guaranteed, and provincial debt) increased markedly&#13;
     from 51.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to an estimated 61.3 percent in 2015. Of this, 48.9 percent of GDP is debt&#13;
     directly owed by the central government, 11.4 percent of GDP is debt guaranteed by the central government, and&#13;
     about 1 percent of GDP is debt of provincial governments. The debt level is fast approaching Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s statutory&#13;
     limit of 65 percent of GDP   . With access to concessional external financing increasingly constrained due to a&#13;
     gradual withdrawal of donors, the government has mainly relied on domestic debt to meet its growing financing&#13;
     needs.&#13;
&#13;
     16.	       The greater reliance on domestic debt, while reducing exchange rate risks, has increased the&#13;
     average interest rate and significantly shortened the maturity profile of public debt. The share of domestic&#13;
     debt in total public debt increased from 45 percent in 2010 to 53 percent in 2014. The limited availability of longer&#13;
     term financing reflects a relatively shallow domestic debt market with few participants (mainly from the banking&#13;
     sector). As a result, debt service payments pose an increasing burden on the budget. Interest expenditures have&#13;
     risen sharply both as a share of GDP and a share of government revenue. In 2014 the government spent about 8&#13;
     percent of its total revenue (including grants) on interest payments (up from 4.3 percent in 2010), crowding out&#13;
     more productive spending and investment. Debt service paymentsâ&#128;&#148;including amortizationâ&#128;&#148;rose to more than&#13;
     a quarter of government revenue in 2014, highlighting the intensified refinancing risks.&#13;

I.2.5. Resilient external sector&#13;
&#13;
17.	 	 Despite subdued global trade growth, Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s export performance remains resilient. Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s total&#13;
export turnover between January and September 2015 is estimated at $120 billion, up 9.2 percent from the same&#13;
period last year. Primary commodity exports decreased significantly because of falling prices. Oil exports fell by&#13;
nearly half in value terms, and exports of agricultural commodities by about 10 percent. But manufacturing exports&#13;
continued to grow robustly, especially in such technology categories as cell phones, electronics, and computers.&#13;
Key labor-intensive manufacturing exports like garments, footwear, and wood products also continued to do well&#13;
growing at an average of 10 percent. There are concerns, however, that the share of imported inputs in these&#13;
products continues to be relatively high, with limited technological spillover from foreign to domestic enterprises&#13;
and the inability of domestic manufacturers to move along the supply chain to capture higher value.&#13;

&amp;#12;     18.	 	 Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s strong export performance is underpinned by impressive diversification of its export basket&#13;
     over the last ten years. Manufacturing exports now account for 84 percent, up from a little more than half in&#13;
     2005. Higher value exports, such as phones, computers, and related components have increased from a less&#13;
     than 5 percent share ten years ago to almost one third now. By the same token, the share of primary commodities&#13;
     has steadily fallenâ&#128;&#148;with oil exports down from nearly 23 percent of total exports in 2005 to around 2.5 percent&#13;
     in September 2015.&#13;

     19.		 Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s trade performance reflects its increasing integration in global value chains. The engine of&#13;
     strong export performance generally originated in the foreign-invested sector, which contributed 68.2 percent of&#13;
     total non-oil exports and grew at 20.8 percent in the first nine months of 2015. The sector is also boosting import&#13;
     demand for machinery and equipment for investment expansion as well as materials and intermediate goods for&#13;
     export processing and manufacturing. While the sector records a significant trade surplus (about 9 percent of&#13;
     GDP in 2015), its increasing share of imported intermediate inputs reflects the limited domestic value addition.&#13;

&amp;#12;20.	 	 Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s export performance, while moderating somewhat this year, still outpaced its regional&#13;
competitors. Vietnam recorded the highest rate of export growth in developing East Asia in 2014 and through&#13;
the first three quarters of 2015. Its merchandise trade performance has benefited from dynamism in the foreign-&#13;
invested manufacturing sector, as leading international manufacturers have expanded production of electronics,&#13;
mobile phones, and associated goods. Exports of mobile phones and spare parts topped US$ 23 billion in the first&#13;
nine months, a 33.2 percent increase year-on-year, making up Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s single biggest export item. Exports of&#13;
computers, electronics items, and spare parts stood at $11.3 billion, up 51.5 percent over the same period last year.&#13;

21.	 	 Imports, especially of capital and intermediate goods, continued to surge, reflecting the uptick in&#13;
investment activity and high import content of some exports. The import bill in the year to September is&#13;
estimated at $124 billion, up 15.6 percent year-on-year compared to 11.6 percent growth in the same period&#13;
in 2014. Imports of machinery, equipment, and intermediate goods have increased by nearly 30 percent. Such&#13;
growth indicates ongoing capacity extensions of production facilities, reflecting positive investor sentiment. But&#13;
the emerging trade deficit also points to underlying structural weaknesses in Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s export sector where major&#13;
exportsâ&#128;&#148;including garments, electronics, and footwearâ&#128;&#148;have high import content requiring imports of raw&#13;
material and intermediate inputs.&#13;

     22.		 Overall Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s trade position weakened during 2015, narrowing the current account surplus.&#13;
     Imports grew faster than exports in the first nine months, resulting in an emerging trade deficit of nearly USD 4&#13;
     billion, compared with a surplus of US$ 2.6 billion in the same period of 2014. After posting a current account&#13;
     surplus of about 5.4 percent of GDP in 2011â&#128;&#147;14, the current account narrowed to an estimated 0.2 percent of&#13;
     GDP at the end of the first half of 2015. The trade deficit (for goods and services) and transfer payments related&#13;
     to the repatriation of profits in the FDI sector were only partly offset by robust remittance inflows.&#13;
&#13;
     23.		 Despite a weaker current account, external financing risks were mitigated by robust FDI inflows and&#13;
     long-term concessional borrowing. Strong and diversified FDI inflows and external loans bolstered the financial&#13;
     account and allowed for a further build-up of reserves. FDI disbursements rose 16.3 percent to about USD 11.8&#13;
     billion in the first ten months of 2015. External debt rollover rates also remained solid, aided by stable official&#13;
     inflows. This allowed for a continued gradual build-up of international reserves to about 2.8 months of imports by&#13;
     the end of Q2 in 2015â&#128;&#148;up slightly from 2.7 months at the end of 2014.&#13;

&amp;#12;I.3. Medium-term Economic Outlook and Risks&#13;
24.		 The medium-term outlook for Vietnam is on balance positive. GDP growth is expected to accelerate to&#13;
around 6.5 percent in 2015 and to strengthen further in 2016, underpinned by a continuing recovery in domestic&#13;
demand, particularly private consumption and investment growth. On the supply side, growth is expected to&#13;
continue to be led by manufacturing and construction. Moderate inflation expectations reduce the likelihood that&#13;
the SBV will tighten monetary policy over the short term. Inflation is expected to remain low on account of low&#13;
global energy and food prices before rebounding somewhat in the medium term. The trade balance is projected&#13;
to narrow significantly this year due to a combination of moderating exports and sustained import growth stoked&#13;
by stronger domestic economic activity. However, robust remittances will keep the current account in surplus,&#13;
if at a much lower level than last year. The fiscal deficit is expected to remain high this year, but start adjusting&#13;
through consolidation efforts to avoid further increases in public debt, which remains sustainable but hinges on&#13;
the envisaged fiscal consolidation program and is subject to substantial risks.&#13;
&#13;
25.		 While the baseline outlook for Vietnam is positive, downside risks dominate. Given limited policy&#13;
buffers, external and domestic shocks could jeopardize macroeconomic stability. On the domestic front, slow&#13;
structural reform poses significant risks to the medium-term growth prospects. Fiscal risks are also substantial,&#13;
and delays in implementing fiscal consolidation could seriously undermine debt sustainability. Growing expenditure&#13;
pressures from high recurrent expenditures, including the wage bill, could make efforts to reduce the deficit&#13;
challenging. Fiscal risks are further aggravated by contingent liabilities associated with SOE debt and state-&#13;
owned banks. With credit growth accelerating, risks in the banking sector, including possible overheating, are also&#13;
intensifying andâ&#128;&#148;if not managed prudentlyâ&#128;&#148;could result in renewed instability with adverse impacts on growth.&#13;
The external environment remains broadly favorable for Vietnam, but emerging external risks call for a continuing&#13;
focus on sound macroeconomic management to safeguard against possible shocks. Fiscal consolidation, more&#13;
exchange rate flexibility, and further bolstering of reserves could all help reduce vulnerabilities.&#13;

I.4.1. The business environment&#13;
&#13;
26.		 Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s ranking on the Doing Business survey has risen from 93rd position in DB2015 to 90th in&#13;
DB2016 among 189 economies. But its competitiveness is still ranked below the average for ASEAN-4 countries,&#13;
with slow improvements in the institutional framework, infrastructure, and business environment. Highlighted&#13;
are problems with tax payment times, protections for minority investors, access to electricity, and dealing with&#13;
business insolvency.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;     27.		 Legislative reforms do not always translate into effective implementation, reflected in discretionary&#13;
     application of laws and regulations. In particular, the tax administration remains cumbersome and imposes high&#13;
     compliance costs on the private sector. While the process for obtaining business permits has improved, weak&#13;
     investor protections and insolvency frameworks continue to undermine incentives for productive firms to invest.&#13;
     Despite Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s trade openness and the move toward the ASEAN single window, border clearance procedures&#13;
     remain less efficient than in other ASEAN economies.&#13;
&#13;
     28.		 The government continued to take steps to improve the investment climate. In 2015, it made further&#13;
     progress with the issuance on March 12, 2015 of resolution 19/NQ-CP/2015 on key duties and solutions to&#13;
     improve business environment and national competitiveness in 2015â&#128;&#147;2016. This resolution aims to lower tax&#13;
     payment period to 121.5 hours a year as maximum, develop and disclose the database on VAT refunds, and&#13;
     rapidly shorten processing times for clearing exports and imports of goods to 13 and 14 days, respectively.&#13;

     I.4.2. Reform of state-owned enterprises&#13;
&#13;
     29.		 The pace of the equitization process has picked up but appears to be inadequate for meeting the&#13;
     governmentâ&#128;&#153;s 2015 target. By the end of September 2015, Vietnam equitized 344 SOEs, including several&#13;
     mother companies of the large State Economic Groups and General Corporations. While it is unlikely that Vietnam&#13;
     will meet its target to equitize 531 SOEs in 2011â&#128;&#147;15, the performance is considerably better than the achievement&#13;
     in the previous SEDP 2006â&#128;&#147;10, during which Vietnam could achieve only 30 percent of its equitization target.&#13;
     Recently, the government announced a plan to disinvest fully from big and well-performing SOEs such as Vinamilk&#13;
     and FPT (Corporation for Financing and Promoting Technology). This move could provide a good momentum to&#13;
     speed up the slower-than-expected process of SOE reform in Vietnam.&#13;

30.		 Progress in improving corporate governance depends largely on the effective implementation of newly&#13;
adopted legal documents. At present, the government is yet to prepare all the necessary implementation decrees&#13;
and circulars. Some decrees became effective recently, such as Decree 87 (from December 1, 2015), Decree&#13;
91 on the Management of State Capital Invested in Enterprises (from December 1, 2015), and Decree 81 on&#13;
public disclosure of operational and financial information of SOEs (from November 5, 2015). These three decrees&#13;
imposed a sound M&amp;E framework for SOEs, relating not just to financial performance but also to nonfinancial&#13;
information such as corporate governance or strategic plans. The adoption of new requirements in information&#13;
disclosure has already begun in some SOEs, and a further roll-out of these practices is expected in 2016.&#13;
The SEDP 2016-20 also makes clear that objectives of the SOE reform will include further separation of state&#13;
regulatory functions from exercise of state ownership, improved professionalism of the board, and separation of&#13;
SOE commercial objectives from social obligations.&#13;
&#13;
I.4.3. Banking sector reformt&#13;
&#13;
31.		 Strengthening oversight and regulation of the banking sector continues to be one of the top&#13;
priorities of financial sector reform. The SBV has concentrated on promulgating stricter prudential regulations,&#13;
applying better risk management for the system (by gradually phasing in Basel II principles), and following a&#13;
multi-pronged approach to NPL resolution (in which the establishment of the Vietnam Asset Management&#13;
Companyâ&#128;&#148;VAMC is a key tool). Circular 02 (issued in 2013 and fully in force in April 2015) is a good step&#13;
toward international good practices in calculating NPL classifications. In addition, Circular 36 (issued in late&#13;
2014) sets better standards for transparency in banking operations and helps address cross-ownership issues&#13;
believed to pose a systemic threat to sector stability. The Circular shows the SBVâ&#128;&#153;s good effort in phasing in&#13;
Basel II principles in Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s banking sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;     32.		 Consolidation in the banking sector accelerated during the first half of 2015, mainly through forced&#13;
     mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As). Unlike previous years, when consolidation was driven mostly by mergers of&#13;
     smaller (and weaker) banks, 2015 witnessed acquisitions of smaller banks by major state-owned commercial&#13;
     banks (SOCBs). Moreover, rather than allowing weak banks to declare bankruptcy, the SBV also took over three&#13;
     smaller banks and placed experienced SOCB management in key positions to turn their operations around. There&#13;
     were also a few mergers among healthier joint-stock commercial banks. Most, if not all, of the M&amp;As are facilitated&#13;
     by the regulators to consolidate the banking sector, address cross-ownership, and reduce systemic risks. Despite&#13;
     the increasing number of M&amp;As, the target of reducing the total number of commercial banks to 15â&#128;&#147;17 by 2017&#13;
     remains a challenging task (currently, there are 34 commercial banks, compared with 42 before the sector reform,&#13;
     due to 8 M&amp;As).&#13;
&#13;
     33.		 Despite the authoritiesâ&#128;&#153; efforts, resolving bad debts in the banking sector remains a critical challenge.&#13;
     The Vietnam Asset Management Company (VAMC) continued to absorb bad assets, but the workout has been&#13;
     slow. While reported systemwide non-performing loans have declined to about 3 percent of total loans, some of&#13;
     the decline is due to transfers of NPLs to VAMC, which had purchased VND 226 trillion (roughly USD 10 billion) of&#13;
     bad debts as of October 2015. New regulations that take effect on October 15, 2015, will introduce a fair-market-&#13;
     value mechanism for NPL purchases by VAMC and allow it to be more flexible in the disposal of NPLs, such as&#13;
     through direct sale of bad debts. These are positive steps that could help resolve NPLs quickly, without too much&#13;
     loss of value.&#13;
&#13;
     34.		 Looking forward, banking regulation and supervision are still under development, and the room for&#13;
     improvement is considerable. The level of compliance with the Basel Core Principles (BCPs) is still low. The&#13;
     combination of the prudential supervision function (focused on the safety and soundness of the banking system)&#13;
     and the â&#128;&#156;general inspectorateâ&#128;&#157; function (focused on investigating violations of administrative procedures) has&#13;
     undermined the core prudential supervision function performed by the SBV. On-site inspections of SOCBs by the&#13;
     SBV have not been conducted for several years, partly to avoid overlap with inspectorate visits by the General&#13;
     Inspectorate and State Audit Office. Off-site monitoring is still in its inception. The regulatory framework contains&#13;
     some provisions related to cross-border banking supervision, but there are still significant supervisory gaps&#13;
     regarding the overseas operations of local banks. The SBV has multiple objectives, and its independence is&#13;
     limited, compromising the capacity of the supervisor to exercise the powers that are granted by legislation. On&#13;
     the positive side, Vietnam has an adequate framework for permissible activities, providing a base for appropriate&#13;
     coverage of regulatory framework over deposit-taking institutions.&#13;

     36.		 Vietnam has strong trade and investment links with TPP members. They account for 38.8 percent of&#13;
     exports, 22.2 percent of imports, and 38.3 percent of foreign direct investment stock of Vietnam. The US, Japan,&#13;
     Malaysia and Singapore are among Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s top ten investors and trading partners. Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s participation&#13;
     in the TPP  , in line with its continuing efforts toward increased global integration, follows on from major trade&#13;
     liberalization efforts over the past two decades. In addition to lowering tariffs on goods trade are agreed measures&#13;
     to lower barriers to service trade and non-tariff measures (NTMs), enforce intellectual property rights, and reduce&#13;
     the role of state-owned enterprises in marketsâ&#128;&#148;all improving the basis for further structural and institutional&#13;
     reforms in Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
     37.		 The TPP opens new trade and investment opportunities for Vietnam in the Asia-Pacific region. The&#13;
     TPP is being promoted as a high standard trade agreement, which will improve market access for goods and&#13;
     services through the reduction of tariff and non-tariff measures (NTMs). As a leading supplier of light and medium&#13;
     manufactures in the Asia-Pacific region, Vietnam stands to obtain preferential access to some of the wealthiest&#13;
     markets in that region, such as the United States and Japan. The benefits are potentially considerable, but so&#13;
     are the costs and the risks, particularly during implementation of wide-ranging commitments. The following&#13;
     analysis, based on available references, presents a preliminary snapshot of the opportunities and challenges&#13;
     facing Vietnam as a TPP signatory. Further in-depth analytical work will be needed based on recently disclosed&#13;
     detailed commitments under the TPP    .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
24      TAKING STOCK An Update on Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s Recent Economic Developments&#13;
&amp;#12;II.2. Scope of the TPP&#13;
38.		 The TPP is a comprehensive and deep trade agreement, comprising not only enhanced market&#13;
access but also wide-ranging commitments on government procurement, regulatory quality, workersâ&#128;&#153; rights,&#13;
environmental protection, and intellectual property rights. The TPP includes 30 chapters covering trade and&#13;
trade-related issues. While the specific commitments have been published only recently, the agreement broadly&#13;
covers tariff barriers to trade in goods, customs and trade facilitation; sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures;&#13;
technical barriers to trade; trade remedies; investment; services; electronic commerce; government procurement;&#13;
intellectual property; labor; environment; â&#128;&#152;horizontalâ&#128;&#153; chapters meant to ensure that the TPP fulfils its potential for&#13;
development, competitiveness, and inclusiveness; dispute settlement, exceptions, and institutional provisions.&#13;
&#13;
39.		 In addition to updating traditional approaches to issues covered by previous free trade agreements&#13;
(FTAs), the TPP incorporates new and emerging trade issues and cross-cutting issues. These include issues&#13;
related to the Internet and the digital economy, the participation of state-owned enterprises in international trade&#13;
and investment, and the ability of small businesses to take advantage of trade agreements. Recognizing the depth&#13;
of the related policy commitments, the agreement is expected to be accompanied with capacity-building for the&#13;
less-developed TPP countries, and in some cases special transitional periods and mechanisms that offer some&#13;
TPP partners additional time, where warranted, to develop capacity to implement new obligations.&#13;
&#13;
40.		 Trade liberalization remains a significant component of market access under trade agreements such&#13;
as the TPP  , particularly for Vietnam. While many countries have lowered average tariffs to below 10 or even 5&#13;
percent, tariff peaks remain. For example, in the US market, tariffs on wearing apparel imports range between&#13;
10 and 32 percent, depending on the class of good (man-made fiber knit products generally draw the highest&#13;
tariffs). Agricultural goods are still governed by tariff rate quota systems, which can lead to tariff rates that may&#13;
be prohibitive in products such as dairy, meat, and rice. Finally, Vietnam is at an earlier stage of development than&#13;
many TPP countries; tariffs are still employed to protect infant industries, leading to tariffs which can exceed an&#13;
average of 10 or 20 percent on a wide range of products.&#13;
&#13;
41.		 In addition, the TPP is being heralded as a comprehensive agreement that also covers significant&#13;
commitments on the reduction of non-tariff measures. Barriers to service trade can include local laws and&#13;
regulations or licenses and registrations (perhaps available only to local companies), or outright prohibition of&#13;
foreign-service providers practicing outside their home countries and markets. In goods trade, non-tariff measures&#13;
can include sanitary and phyto-sanitary regulations and technical barriers to trade, which might include labeling&#13;
requirements, testing mandates, or other specifications that prove a barrier to importing goods.&#13;
&#13;
II.3. Estimating the impact of the TPP&#13;
42.		 The TPP is expected to generate considerable benefits for Vietnam in trade, investment, growth and&#13;
job creation. Among the current TPP signatories, Vietnamâ&#128;&#148;as the economy with the lowest per-capita GDPâ&#128;&#148;has&#13;
unique comparative advantages, particularly in labor-intensive manufacturing and in sectors currently subject to high&#13;
tariffs, such as textiles and garments. By enhancing access to key export markets, the TPP is expected to boost&#13;
overall trade. It is also expected to lead to further increases in (already considerable) FDI inflows to build up export&#13;
capacity, including in upstream suppliers to sectors subject to strict rules of origin (such as textiles and garment).&#13;
&#13;
43.		 Preliminary results suggest that the TPP could add as much as 8 percent to Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s GDP          , 17 percent&#13;
to its real exports, and 12 percent to its capital stock over the next 20 years.2 TPP projections suggest that&#13;
this regional trade agreement could increase cumulative real GDP in Vietnam by more than 8 percent in 2030&#13;
(box 1). The main source of this increase in real GDP for Vietnam is projected to be tariff reductions in the TPP&#13;
regionâ&#128;&#148;textiles and apparel in particular, where US tariffs remain high at over 17 percent ad valorem. Reductions&#13;
in goods and services NTMs also promise to contribute significantly to Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s growth (figure 13). Investment&#13;
in Vietnam is projected to increase by more than 20 percent under the TPP   , substantially increasing capital stocks&#13;
and long-term growth. Wages are projected to increase in five occupational categories over 2020â&#128;&#147;2035, with the&#13;
highest growth in wages for low-skilled workers.&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
 These estimates were originally prepared on March 2015 (Minor, Walmsley, and Strutt 2015). Negotiations to finish the TPP concluded on&#13;
October 5, 2015, and the near-final text was released on November 5, 2015. Differences between the TPP as finally agreed and the TPP as&#13;
anticipated in the analysis could yield alternative estimates of TPP impacts, as noted in the text box.&#13;

&#13;
        The results in this note are based on the Dynamic Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model, a multiregion, multisector,&#13;
        computable general equilibrium model, with perfect competition and constant returns to scale. The specification for this&#13;
        simulation included consumer demand specifications and intersectoral factor mobility. The dynamic model incorporates&#13;
        investment behavior that allows for the gradual equalization of rates of return over time. The choice of sectors and regions&#13;
        in the aggregation reflects the focus on the Vietnamese economy: important sectors and trading partners of Vietnam&#13;
        have been selected, with the rest of the world divided into low-middle, upper-middle and high income, based on World&#13;
        Bank classifications.&#13;
&#13;
        The results of this simulation need to be interpreted with caution. They depend on the underlying assumptions of the&#13;
        model both in the macroeconomic parameters and the policy changes, including the speed and quality of implementation&#13;
        of commitments.&#13;
&#13;
        Assumptions&#13;
&#13;
        The results consider the impacts of reductions in tariffs on goods and in non-tariff measures on goods and services. Given&#13;
        that the detailed commitments were only published recently, the simulations are not based on specific commitments.&#13;
        Instead, the model incorporates the following assumptions:&#13;
        	 â&#128;¢	 &amp;#7;Tariffs: Reduction of tariffs to zero with 1 percent sensitive products (approximately 50 HS6 lines), a 15 year&#13;
                 phase-out, and 65 percent of tariff lines free. Phase-out starts 2016.&#13;
        	 â&#128;¢	 &amp;#7;   Goods non-tariff measures: Reduction to match the top quintile in the TPP region phased in over five years from&#13;
                 2016 to 2020.&#13;
        	 â&#128;¢	 &amp;#7;   Services non-tariff measures: Reduction to match the top quintile in the TPP region, phased in over five years&#13;
                 from 2016 to 2020&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26      TAKING STOCK An Update on Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s Recent Economic Developments&#13;
&amp;#12;   Differences between these assumptions (adopted for estimates completed in March 2015) and the TPP as finally agreed&#13;
   in October 2015 and published in November 2015 would yield alternative results if the actual provisions had been&#13;
   incorporated into the analysis. These differences are in the following areas, among others:&#13;
   	 â&#128;¢	 &amp;#7;  The market access provisions of the TPP specify the actual products shielded from tariff reductions, or subject to&#13;
           tariff rate quotas. The identities of these products were not known when the simulation analysis was completed.&#13;
           Instead, a proxy for the list of exempted products was based on the assumption stated above. Moreover, the&#13;
           ability to exploit increases in market access may be modified in the actual TPP by the operation of rules of origin,&#13;
           also not known precisely when the estimates were made and which are challenging to model.&#13;
   	 â&#128;¢	 &amp;#7;  In the area of goods NTMs, the TPP as finally agreed provides for a series of consultations to promote common&#13;
           regulatory practices, focused on an enumerated list of sectors (chapter 8, â&#128;&#156;Technical Barriers to Tradeâ&#128;&#157;).&#13;
           Actual harmonization or mutual recognition of regulations, which could lead to reduction or elimination of&#13;
           NTMs, will presumably emerge from these consultations. For the simulation, it was necessary to estimate the&#13;
           overall reduction in the economic effect of NTMs in the absence of this information, based on the above-stated&#13;
           assumption.&#13;
   	 â&#128;¢	 &amp;#7;  In the area of services NTMs, the extent of actual liberalization achieved by the TPP is defined in the provisions&#13;
           and annexes of chapter 10, â&#128;&#156;Cross-Border Trade in Services,â&#128;&#157; which specify the application of national treatment,&#13;
           most-favored-nation treatment, and market access on a â&#128;&#156;negative listâ&#128;&#157; basis. This information also was not&#13;
           available when the simulation analysis was conducted, and was proxied by the above-stated assumption.&#13;

44.		 The TPP will facilitate market access and improve export opportunities for Vietnam. Most tariffs and&#13;
many non-tariff barriers on industrial goods will be eliminated and reduced almost immediately, and tariffs and&#13;
other restrictive policies on agricultural goods will be eliminated or reduced over time. Both exports and imports&#13;
are projected to rise under the impact of the TPP agreement, as a result of lower trade costs (table 6). Market&#13;
access, especially to the United States and Japan, is particularly important to Vietnam. While boosting overall&#13;
trade (trade creation), the TPP would also result in opportunities for trade diversion, as Vietnamese exports would&#13;
likely replace a share of exports of non-TPP countries (including China) to the US market. At the same time,&#13;
imports would surge, reflecting a pick-up in investment and intermediate goods.&#13;

&amp;#12;     45.		 The TPP would be expected to reinforce the further diversification of Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s export basket toward&#13;
     manufacturing exports. As discussed in more detail in the main section of this taking stock report, Vietnam&#13;
     experienced a rapid transformation of its export basket over the past decade - away from primary exports toward&#13;
     higher value manufacturing exports. The TPP is expected to further accelerate this process, with real exports&#13;
     expected to rise, especially in manufacturing. Manufactured exports - about 58.1 percent of Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s exports&#13;
     today - are expected to increase by about 30 percent over the baseline in 2035, while all other sectors - agriculture,&#13;
     services, oil, gas, and minerals - would decline modestly.&#13;
&#13;
     	      &amp;#7; he textiles, apparel, and leather (including footwear) sector is expected to realize considerable gains&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 T&#13;
            in export growth. Tariffs on these products in the TPP region are among the highest, averaging 17.1 percent&#13;
            on US imports of these products from Vietnam and averaging from 7.7 percent in the TPP-Asia region to&#13;
            20.6 percent elsewhere in the TPP region. As a result, Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s exports of textile and apparel products&#13;
            are projected to increase by about 60 percent above baseline real exports in 2035. The United States is the&#13;
            primary destination in the TPP region (20.9 percent) with the highest increase in exports (218.8 percent).&#13;
            The sectorâ&#128;&#153;s high labor intensity and strong export orientation make it extremely important for employment&#13;
            creation. The Vietnam textile apparel association (VITAS) estimates that every $1 billion increase in textile&#13;
            and apparel exports creates 150,000 to 200,000 jobs. So the sector is strategic for both exports and jobs.&#13;
            But the TPPâ&#128;&#153;s rules of origin could limit the potential positive impacts (see below).&#13;
&#13;
     	      &amp;#7; ommodity exports are expected to continue to decline. Oil, gas, and mineral exports - about 16.5&#13;
         â&#128;¢	 C&#13;
            percent of Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s exports in 2015 - would continue to decline as a result of TPP . Agricultural exports&#13;
            - about 15.4 percent of exports in 2015 - would also decline, underpinned by a broad-based contraction&#13;
            of major export commodities from rice and grain to processed food and forestry products (wood) during&#13;
            2015 - 2025. This is mainly reflecting accelerated structural transformation with more production factors&#13;
            reallocating to manufacturing.&#13;
&#13;
     46.		 The TPP would also boost Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s imports, reflecting Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s integration in global value chains.&#13;
     Imports of manufactured goods, mainly intermediate products (with a two-thirds share of the baseline 2015&#13;
     imports), would increase at a much higher rate than agriculture (10 percent share of the baseline 2015 imports)&#13;
     and services (figure 17). Under the baseline scenario, textile, apparel, and leather imports (14.9 percent of&#13;
     total imports) would grow to more than 50 percent of baseline imports. The rapid rise in textile, apparel, and&#13;
     leather imports mirrors the increased production and exports of these products, which in turn require imported&#13;
     intermediate products and materials of fabric, dyes, and rubber. Again, rules of origin would impose limitations on&#13;
     the use of inputs from non-TPP countries in the textile, apparel and leather sectors. Given the strict rules of origin,&#13;
     these imports would originate predominately from the TPP region. Imports of textiles and apparel from the TPP&#13;
     region would grow by 151.3 percent and 203.7 percent from TPP countries in Asia and the US, respectively.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
47.		 The TPP is expected to facilitate further structural transformation of Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s economy. Real output&#13;
in manufacturing could grow by a cumulative 30 percent above the baseline level (figure 18). Services would grow&#13;
by about 5 percent over the baseline. Agricultural output and oil, gas and minerals both are expected to decline&#13;
slightly from baseline growth, but as investment increases, and capital prices decline, output recovers somewhat.&#13;
The projected decreases in agricultural output are greatest in the first few years of the TPP, before investment and&#13;
capital stocks respond. In the long run of 2025-35, changes in investment and factor costs attenuate the initial&#13;
decreases in production from baseline growth.&#13;
&#13;
48.		 The TPP is also expected to stimulate investment. It is projected that investment would increase&#13;
significantly relative to the baseline from 2015 through 2025, peaking at nearly 23 percent above the baseline.&#13;
But this stimulation would diminish in 2025â&#128;&#147;35. The rise in investment is driven by the increasing rate of return,&#13;
a function of capital costs and the rental rate of capital, in turn influenced heavily by the rise in manufacturing&#13;
exports to TPP markets. As a participant in the TPP, Vietnam can be expected to attract even larger flows of quality&#13;
foreign investments, especially FDI allocated in upstream clusters of beneficial sectors, such as textiles, apparel,&#13;
and leather.&#13;
&#13;
49.		 Perhaps most important, the TPP is expected to anchor and accelerate domestic structural reforms.&#13;
The TPP is not only removing trade barriers and enhancing market access to key export markets, but it will also&#13;
have tangible impacts on regulatory quality, intellectual property rights, investor protection, competition, SOE&#13;
management, labor and environmental standards, food safety, public procurement, and liberalization of services,&#13;
including financial services and telecommunications. Many TPP chapters will stimulate institutional reforms to&#13;
strengthen and standardize rules and transparency and support the creation of modern institutions in Vietnam.&#13;
Implementing these commitments will be particularly challenging for Vietnamâ&#128;&#148;given its gradual reform path and&#13;
institutional legacies (large SOE sector, incomplete market institutions). But it has shown in its accession to WTO&#13;
that it can leverage external commitments to advance domestic reforms, especially in challenging reform areas.&#13;
&#13;
50.		 So the TPP could support a more competitive and innovative economy. Over the longer term, it is&#13;
not just the growth rate of exports that mattersâ&#128;&#148;it is also the composition of exports, particularly the level of&#13;
technology they embody. Despite Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s good performance in recent years, such as between 2008 and 2013,&#13;
high technology exports increased from 5 percent of manufactured goods exports to 28 percent, comparable with&#13;
China and higher than the ASEAN average. But domestic value added is still relatively limited. As mentioned, under&#13;
the TPP , larger flows of quality foreign investment can be expected in Vietnam, directed particularly to ancillary&#13;
industries of beneficial sectors, such as textile, apparel, and leather. That will shape appropriate domestic supply&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;     chains while stimulating domestic private firms to integrate more into global value chains and further boost value&#13;
     added exports.&#13;
&#13;
     51.		 Given Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s high dependence on imported materials in key sectors, the TPPâ&#128;&#153;s restrictive rules of&#13;
     origins could limit Vietnam from maximizing TPP benefits, at least in the short term. Most imported yarn and&#13;
     fibre used by Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s garment producers are sourced from non-TPP territories (figure 20). Some 60-90 percent&#13;
     of Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s textiles come from other countries, mostly from China and Taiwan. A large part of Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s current&#13;
     exports in the sector would likely not comply with TPP rules of origin requirements. The textile sector would have&#13;
     to restructure toward backward integration to maximize the TPP benefits. While this poses a challenges in the&#13;
     short term, FDI in upstream businesses is expected to build up needed production capacity.&#13;
&#13;
     52.		 Rules of origin also create opportunities for industrial restructuring and deepening of domestic value&#13;
     added in Vietnam. The need to restructure textile and apparel toward backward integration could facilitate&#13;
     domestic enterprises, including SMEs to expand domestic supply chains and take part in global value chains&#13;
     (GVCs). This move would enable capturing more value-added and lead to learning and the accumulation of&#13;
     knowledge capital. This is underpinned by increased FDI. As the private sector responds to take advantage of the&#13;
     TPP , Japanese, Chinese and South Korean firms are investing heavily in fibre production in Vietnam. The Texhong&#13;
     Textile and Garment Group (Hong Kong) is building a $300 million yarn plant for the first phase in Quang-Ninh&#13;
     province. The 100-percent Korean-owned Kyungbang Company started construction on a $40 million spinning&#13;
     mill in Binh Duong. VINATEX Kien Giang is investing VND 150 billion in a garment factory in Binh Duong. And&#13;
     another $1 billion in FDI is in the pipeline.&#13;

     53.		 But the investment in upstream and ancillary industries, especially in textiles, needs to be accompanied&#13;
     by sound regulation to mitigate environmental impacts. Investments in textile manufacturingâ&#128;&#148;particularly&#13;
     the dyeing and finishing of fabricâ&#128;&#148; can have enormous environmental impacts. These industries are not only&#13;
     extremely water intensive, but also heavily polluting, discharging waste water and pollutant loads. There is a risk&#13;
     that Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s use of polluting textile chemicals could increase sharply. To mitigate these impacts, Vietnam will&#13;
     need to adopt environmental policies to encourage the use of advanced environmentally friendly technology.&#13;

&amp;#12;II.4. Policy implications&#13;
54.		 Delivering commitments under the TPP means implementing a comprehensive and decisive domestic&#13;
reform program. Behind-the-border issues matter. Among other things, the TPP commitments will affect SOE&#13;
management, reforms to improve transparency in government procurement, regulatory quality and enforcement,&#13;
competition policy, and labor and environment standards.&#13;
&#13;
55.		 The TPP includes a general commitment by signatories to respect the labor rights enumerated in the&#13;
International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Vietnam made&#13;
more specific commitments in a TPP side agreement, entitled the United Statesâ&#128;&#148;Viet Nam Plan for the Enhancement&#13;
of Trade and Labour Relations. If fully implemented, these commitments would mark a sharp shift from the current&#13;
structure of labor relations, which has all unions falling under the umbrella of the Vietnam General Confederation of&#13;
Labour (VGCL), to the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam. The key provision is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
		&amp;#7;&#13;
  Viet Nam shall ensure that its laws and regulations permit workers, without distinction, employed by&#13;
  an enterprise to form a grassroots labour union (in Vietnamese to chuc cua nguoi lao dong) of their&#13;
  own choosing without prior authorizationâ&#128;¦. A grassroots labour union registered with the competent&#13;
  government body shall have the right autonomously to elect its representatives, adopt its constitution&#13;
  and rules, organize its administration, including managing its finances and assets, bargain collectively,&#13;
  and organize and lead strikes and other collective actions related to the occupational and socio-economic&#13;
  interests of the workers at its enterprise.&#13;
&#13;
56.		 The agreement commits Vietnam to put this provision into effect before the date of the TPPâ&#128;&#153;s entry into&#13;
force. Through a separate provision, Vietnam has committed to allowing grassroots labor unions to form larger&#13;
organizations across enterprises, within five years from the date of the TPPâ&#128;&#153;s entry into force. The agreement&#13;
foresees technical assistance from the ILO to implement the agreement.&#13;
&#13;
57.		 While Vietnam is doing well in terms of competitiveness, there connectivity challenges. Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
investment in connective infrastructure has shortened many economic distances. In manufacturing and agriculture,&#13;
trade costs are much lower than expected for the economyâ&#128;&#153;s development, and these costs have fallen sharply,&#13;
particularly in manufacturing. Today, Vietnam is ranked 48 of 160 countries in the 2014 Logistics Performance&#13;
Index, highest among the lower middle-income countries (outperforming Indonesia, India, Philippines, etc.) and&#13;
improved from the 2012 ranking (53). But it lags behind its higher-income competitors, including China, Malaysia&#13;
and Thailand. To make the most of the opportunities in the TPP        , implementing these commitments could be&#13;
accompanied by furthers steps to enhance Vietnamâ&#128;&#153;s competitiveness, including investments in roads, power,&#13;
ports, and logistics services and further efforts to enhance the efficiency of border clearance procedures. Despite&#13;
the recent progress in customs reform and the implementation of the National and ASEAN Single Window, the&#13;
compliance costs in time and money for goods clearance on and behind the border remain high in Vietnam.&#13;
Recent research outcomes show that most of the high compliance costs relate to non-customs barriers, or&#13;
NTMs. More than 200 trade-related procedures and NTM-related licenses are regulated and required through a&#13;
complex set of legislative documents and regulations. These licenses, managed and granted by a number of state&#13;
management agencies, are not always consistent, and the state management agencies do not always coordinate&#13;
with each other well.3&#13;
