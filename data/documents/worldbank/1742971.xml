Summary&#13;
In order to understand the dynamics&#13;
of good governance at the village&#13;
level, the Water and Sanitation&#13;
Program-South Asia (WSP-SA)&#13;
commissioned a study of village&#13;
water and sanitation committee in                                                   iIJr&#13;
two World Bank-assisted rural water&#13;
supply and sanitation projects in the&#13;
states of Karnataka and Uttar&#13;
Pradesh, India. The study concludes&#13;
that transparency, participation,&#13;
inclusion and ownership are&#13;
important committee features. When     Polkot village in the hills of Uttar Pradesh                                     _&#13;

satisfaction.                            throughout the world. A key lesson from global research over the past decade is the strong&#13;
relationship between a demand-responsive approach and overall project effectiveness (Narayan&#13;
1995; Sara and Katz 1998). As a result, external support agencies and governments in India and&#13;
9 .                 z&lt;^ -Ew             around the world are relying upon community-level organizations to respond to community&#13;
- -  g r          demand and assist in the planning, construction and maintenance of water projects. Based upon&#13;
ML           _evidence that these cornmunity-level organizations can lead to more effective projects, the Karnataka&#13;
and Uttar Pradesh RWSS projects were designed to have committees that functioned at the village&#13;
level.&#13;
I m p Implementing a water scheme at the village level in India raises the question of whether&#13;
gram panchayats (local government bodies) are ideal for implementing a participatory,&#13;
community-driven approach. There are several reasons to be concerned about the potential&#13;
|  @   '4.; efficacy of gram panchayats.&#13;
|  J   ;  b  They often administer an area larger than the village of interest.&#13;
|*X    b  There is concern about their inclusion of marginalized groups.&#13;
L  There is potential for political interference and rent-seeking.&#13;
C  Due to their many other responsibilities, they cannot focus solely on water and sanitation&#13;
problems within the village.&#13;
For these reasons, plans for separate Village Water and Sanitation Committees (VWSCs)&#13;
were incorporated into the project design in both states.&#13;

The Impact of Low Social Capital on&#13;
VWSC Effectiveness and Project Effectiveness&#13;
Alkochuwa village has a low score for both VWSC effectiveness and project effectiveness. The committee has not met&#13;
since the implementation stage and has made no attempt to collect tariff. Only 59 percent of the households said they were&#13;
satisfied with the new water system. The performance of the VWSC is marked by lack of participation, inclusion and transparency,&#13;
and a low sense of ownership.&#13;
Participation: The village has 242 households, of which only 81 have contributed towards the initial capital cost. None of&#13;
the surveyed households recalled attending a meeting during the planning stage and only 20 percent of the households&#13;
participated in decisions regarding the location of handpumps.&#13;
Inclusion: Three women are ostensibly on the village committee. However, one woman is a landless laborer who infrequently&#13;
attends meetings due to her need to work. The second woman is always represented by her son and the third woman is usually&#13;
represented by her husband. This is typical of the culture in Bundelkhand, where women frequently practice purdah and&#13;
politics is considered to be a male domain.&#13;
Water is not equitably distributed in the village. Although a total of 12 handpumps have been constructed, all of them&#13;
are not considered 'public' handpumps. During the planning and implementation stages of the project, a few households&#13;
contributed the entire capital cost for one handpump (Rs 4,000) on the understanding that neighboring households would pay&#13;
them back after the handpumps were operational. However, this has not happened and the villagers consider the handpumps&#13;
to be the property of individual households. Some households even go so far as to remove the chain when they are not using&#13;
the pump to ensure that other villagers do not use the facility.&#13;
Transparency: The overall score for transparency in Alkachuwa is 32.6 (the highest possible score is 100). This is the second&#13;
lowest score for transparency for the study villages of both states (N =45). The village community is generally unaware of the&#13;
project; only 29 percent of the households in the village said that they were told during the plonning stage of the community's&#13;
responsibility for operation and maintenance, and 26 percent of the villagers knew how committee members were selected.&#13;
Sense of ownership: When asked, VWSC members in Alkochuwa said that they were not responsible for operation and&#13;
maintenance of the project. It is not surprising that only 26 percent of the villagers feel that the community can sustain the&#13;
handpumps over the next ten years. This VWSC scored the fourth lowest out of all the 45 study villages on this parameter.&#13;
Influence of social capital: The village has experienced a number of caste and class conflicts. Drainage has not been&#13;
completed as households are unwilling to give up any part of their land. Similarly, one handpump was never installed due to&#13;
disputes about its location.&#13;

            In order to understand the dynamics of
            good governance at the village level, the Water and
            Sanitation Program - South Asia commissioned a study of
            village water and sanitation committee, in two World
            Bank-assisted rural water supply, and sanitation projects in
            the states of Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, India. The study
            concludes that transparency, participation, inclusion, and
            ownership are important committee features. When committees
            have higher scores for these features, the projects are more
            effective in terms of both financial performance, and
            consumer satisfaction.
