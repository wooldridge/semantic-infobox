            Exploring psychosocial well-being and

            This paper describes research conducted
            as the first stage in the process of developing a structured
            interview schedule to assess psychological distress,
            empowerment, social connectedness, economic well-being, and
            other variables among women in the Acholi region of Uganda.
            An interview schedule was developed following a review of
            the literature, individual interviews with women in northern
            Uganda, and group discussions with community members,
            members of women's groups, and community leaders.
            Following initial testing of the entire interview schedule,
            the reliability and validity of two sections-measures of
            psychological distress and social connectedness, were
            explored in more detail. Initial analysis suggests that both
            are potentially useful with this population. However, the
            measure of psychological distress did not distinguish
            clearly between a group of women identified by a local
            community-based organization (CBO) as showing signs of
            psychological distress and a group of women showing no such
            signs. Additional work is required to confirm the validity
            of the psychological distress scale used. It was found that
            psychological well-being was more closely associated with
            the amount of social support a woman receives than with how
            many social activities or groups she is involved with.
            Involvement in groups may not, in itself, alleviate
            psychological distress, but the practical and emotional
            support provided by friends, neighbors, and relatives is
            likely to have a positive effect. Some evidence was found
            that there is a relationship between involvement in
            religious activities and psychological well-being.
            Psychological distress is often accompanied by poor physical
            health. Although further research is required to clarify the
            nature of these relationships, initial findings suggest that
            organizations that aim to improve psychological well-being
            would do well to address physical health problems as a
            priority, and may wish to explore ways in which women
            experiencing psychological distress could link with
            religious organizations.
