provide additional funds to supplement the financial assistance furnished by the Bank under Loan&#13;
Agreement (Early Childhood Development Project), dated June 10, 2008, between Jamaica and the Bank.&#13;

such additional loan are to be applied continues to come within the purposes of the Bank as set forth in&#13;
Article I of said Articles of Agreement, and that said Project is designed to promote the development of&#13;
the productive facilities and resources of Jamaica and is in the interest of Jamaica and of the members of&#13;
the Bank as a whole.&#13;
