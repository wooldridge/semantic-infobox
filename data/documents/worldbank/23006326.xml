ANNEX 2&#13;
Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex will be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration&#13;
Agreements between the Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
1.    Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1   The Bank will be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set&#13;
forth in this Administration Agreement and will not be subject to any other duties or&#13;
responsibilities to the Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that&#13;
might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or&#13;
fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement will be considered a waiver of&#13;
any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each  Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") will be&#13;
administered in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the&#13;
same may be amended from time to time, including its procurement, financial&#13;
management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to prevent and combat&#13;
fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to&#13;
finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant&#13;
decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United&#13;
Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any obligations of&#13;
the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and&#13;
executive orders of an individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.    Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1   The funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be accounted for as a single trust fund&#13;
and will be kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in&#13;
the Trust Fund may be commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank.&#13;
The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust&#13;
Fund.&#13;
2.2   The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund will be held is United States&#13;
Dollars (the "Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in&#13;
their respective Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a&#13;
Contribution Currency other than the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of&#13;
such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions, the Bank will convert such&#13;
amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date&#13;
of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-7-&#13;
result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor will bear any&#13;
responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4   The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into&#13;
other currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the&#13;
Bank on the date of the conversion.&#13;
2.5   The Bank will invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending&#13;
their disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for&#13;
the investment of trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank will credit all income&#13;
from such investment to the Trust Fund to be used for the same purposes as the&#13;
Contributions.&#13;
3.    Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1   The Bank will deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each&#13;
Installment, an amount equal to two percent (2%) per Installment as an administrative fee&#13;
for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2   In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program&#13;
management and Trust Fund administration, that are: (i) not covered by the percentage&#13;
deduction specified above as an administrative fee; and (ii) not included under Annex I&#13;
of the Administration Agreements in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and&#13;
procedures will be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis up to a maximum of ten&#13;
percent (10%) of the total Contributions under all Administration Agreements.&#13;
3.2 3 Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in&#13;
this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated&#13;
Contributions. If actual Contributions significantly differ from what was originally&#13;
anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration Agreement, or if other&#13;
circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to&#13;
request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be&#13;
effectuated by amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and&#13;
which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that are provided either as&#13;
amendments to supplement existing Administration Agreements or from new Donors&#13;
under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.    Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
4.1   The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the&#13;
funds deposited in the Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;
4.2   The Bank will furnish to the Donors current financial information relating to&#13;
receipts, disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the&#13;

&#13;

receipts, disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the&#13;

over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a&#13;
combined financial statement for all,cash-based trust funds together with the Bank's&#13;
external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit will be borne by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
4.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit&#13;
by the Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank will first&#13;
consult as to whether such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor will&#13;
agree on the appropriate scope and terms of reference of such audit. Following&#13;
agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank will arrange for such external&#13;
audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect&#13;
to such audit, will be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;

Bank will agree on the scope and conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank will&#13;
provide all relevant information within the limits of the Bank's applicable policies and&#13;
procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by the Bank, will be borne&#13;
by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not constitute a&#13;
financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.    Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by&#13;

any agreements entered into between the Bank and any consultants and/or other third&#13;
parties for the purposes of this Administration Agreement, including any Grant&#13;
Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank&#13;
will return to the relevant Donor or Donors in the Holding Currency in the manner&#13;
specified by each such Donor in its respective Administration Agreement the pro rata&#13;
share(s) of any such uncommitted balance of the Trust Fund, in accordance with any&#13;
additional terms that may be agreed between the Bank and each such Donor.&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
Governance&#13;
This Annex will be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration&#13;
Agreements between the Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
A two-tier governance structure is proposed for the Zimbabwe Reconstruction Fund: (a)&#13;
a policy oversight committee responsible for policy oversight, resource mobilization, and&#13;
project/grant approvals; and (b) technical working groups responsible for technical and&#13;
eligibility screening of project/grants. The two structures will be supported by a&#13;
secretariat based in Harare and project support teams.  The effectiveness of the&#13;
governance structure would be assessed after 6-12 months of Trust Fund operation. In its&#13;
role as ZIMREF administrator, the Bank would be responsible for, among others: overall&#13;
management of the Trust Fund; technical oversight and quality control for Trust Fund&#13;
funded projects in accordance with Bank policies and procedures; and establishment and&#13;
