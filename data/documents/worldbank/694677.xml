&amp;#12;&#13;
1. THE WATER AND SANITATION SECTOR IN THE&#13;
PHILIPPINES&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.1  In the Philippines, only about 65% of the 28 million residents in large urban&#13;
centers receive piped water, and most use open drains, septic tanks and pit latrines to&#13;
dispose of liquid and human waste. As a result, public health is severely affected:&#13;
Gastro-intestinal illnesses and typhoid are common among the urban poor, particularly&#13;
children. Moreover, as untreated wastewater and septage are dumped directly into the&#13;
waterways and coastal areas, the beaches and other bodies of water are polluted.&#13;
1.2   Sewerage is virtually non-existent outside the Metropolitan Manila area, found&#13;
only in small sections of two or three towns. Thus, most residents rely on private&#13;
solutions to dispose of human and liquid waste, and the use of open drains and poorly&#13;
constructed septic tanks pollute the urban areas and surrounding water bodies.&#13;
1.3   Public water supply and sanitation services in urban areas are provided by three&#13;
principal agencies. In the Metro Manila area, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage&#13;
System (MWSS) supplies water and collects about 18% of the wastewater before&#13;
discharging it untreated into Manila Bay. In approximately 500 other large cities and&#13;
towns, water supply services are provided by autonomous local water districts,&#13;
established under the Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973.1 The Local Water Utilities&#13;
Administration (LWUA) is a special lending institution established to develop water&#13;
supply and sewerage services in these Water Districts, though its financing so far has&#13;
been only for water supply. Elsewhere, in about 1000 small towns, water supply is&#13;
provided by line departments of municipal governents or city-level Local Government&#13;
Units (LGUs).&#13;
1.4   Overall, water supply and sanitation services are provided by decentralized&#13;
organizations, accountable to locally elected officials. This is consistent with the national&#13;
policy of vesting territorial and political subdivisions with legal and fiscal autonomy to&#13;
choose between investment priorities, and to finance public investments from own-&#13;
managed resources. Since the Local Government Code was passed in 1991, municipal&#13;
governments have been receiving substantial block transfers each year through a formula-&#13;
based Internal Revenue Allocation (IRA) that supplements their local resources.&#13;
Mayors retain indirect influence because they appoint the Board of Directors of Water Districts on fLxed&#13;
term appointments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
1.5   On the supply side, however, localized development of water supply systems has,&#13;
had some adverse consequences. Political considerations appear to have been a prime&#13;
force in the formation Water District boundaries -- rather than establishing water supply&#13;
franchise areas that are optimal from an economic, financial or hydrological point of&#13;
view. Water utility management in neighboring towns (both in Water Districts and in&#13;
LGU-managed water utilities) have shown reluctance to amalgamate operations to the&#13;
minimum efficient scale; failed to take advantage of the economies offered by river basin-&#13;
oriented supply networks in defining their service boundaries; and ignored the possibility&#13;
of developing sewerage on the grounds that recovering costs for regional systems would&#13;
be impractical.&#13;
1.6   On the demand side, income levels of domestic, commercial and industrial&#13;
consumers have been rising over the last five years, and with them the willingness to pay&#13;
for adequate and reliable services. Despite increasing demand, most Philippine water&#13;
utilities have not sufficiently risen to the challenge in terms of satisfying customer&#13;
expectations. Operating in suboptimal organizational sizes, failing to take advantage of&#13;
economies of scale, relying on the necessarily rationed investment funds from the public&#13;
exchequer, water utilities in cities and towns have been unable to adequately either&#13;
increase coverage or expand services of water supply and sanitation services.2 Current&#13;
projections of investment requirements to meet demand for the next decade in the largest&#13;
secondary cities like Cebu, Davao, Cagayan de Oro run into the hundreds of millions of&#13;
dollars each for water supply, and into billions of dollars if sewerage were included as&#13;
well.&#13;
1.7  In the past, national and local water supply agencies have absorbed large&#13;
quantities of national public investmnent funds, much of which are financed by the&#13;
international donor community. Currently, for example, altogether, national sectoral&#13;
agencies--supported by the Asian Development Bank, Japan's Overseas Economic&#13;
Cooperation Fund and other bilateral donors--are investing an estimated US$567 million&#13;
for the MWSS areas and US$496 million for the LWUA areas in water supply and&#13;
sewerage development.3&#13;
1.8   Private sector interest in water supply. Since private firms successfully addressed&#13;
the supply problems confronting the Philippine power sector in 1994, investors' interest&#13;
in water supply infrastructure have been very high. Their focus has been on the fast-&#13;
growing urban areas where the demand for water has rapidly outpaced public investment.&#13;
They are positive about augmenting the water supply (i.e. bulk water production) through&#13;
2The worst affected have been low income consumers, who have had to rely on water vendors, charging&#13;
ten to fifteen times the official tariffs.&#13;
3The Bank currently has two on-going project in the urban water supply sector, one for Subic Bay with a&#13;
substantial water supply component and another for MWSS. Both were approved by the Board in&#13;
1996&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
BOT (build-operate-transfer) contracts. Interest in taking over, expanding and managing&#13;
water distribution networks -- where the inefficiencies of the public system are most&#13;
pronounced -- has generally been much less. Private sector interests include Metro&#13;
Manila service area, the region surrounding it, and some of the rapidly growing urban&#13;
centers such as Subic Bay, Metro Cebu, Davao, Zamboanga and Cagayan de Oro. BOT&#13;
proposals of over $1.3 billion for bulk water supply are currently being prepared.4&#13;
1.9   The Government's strategy is to encourage the private sector in both the&#13;
production and distribution of water supply and sewerage service, so that unmet demand&#13;
is efficiently covered, and service providers are made fully accountable to service users.&#13;
Currently, the IFC is assisting the Government to privatize MWSS through two&#13;
concession contracts, in which concessionaires are expected to invest about US$6 billion&#13;
over the next 25 years for the entire water supply and sanitation production, distribution,&#13;
collection and treatment system serving the metropolitan Manila area. In Subic Bay&#13;
Freeport, water supply and sewerage will be provided by a joint venture, involving the&#13;
private sector and local public agencies.&#13;
1.10  Public investment in sewerage and sanitation. With the exception ofthe MWSS&#13;
area (which already has coverage of about 10% of its customers with sewerage), the&#13;
prospects of the private sector providing sewerage infrastructure are not promising:&#13;
Secondary cities have no sewerage at present; investments are lumpy, and most potential&#13;
consumers have already privately invested in individual septic tanks for human waste&#13;
disposal.&#13;
1.11  The necessity for sewerage has arisen because untreated wastewater has generated&#13;
considerable pollution in and around these cities. These public good aspects make cost&#13;
recovery of regional facilities from individual consumers difficult to enforce. Thus,&#13;
national policy makers have recognized that sewerage and sanitation investments in the&#13;
secondary cities will need to be publicly funded for some time to come.&#13;
B. Sector Policy Developments&#13;
1.12 In 1994 a Water and Sanitation Sectoral Review was completed by NEDA, with&#13;
the assistance of the Bank. The major issues identified, and strategies recommended&#13;
were:&#13;
(i) Recognizing that improving efficiency would increase water supply availability to&#13;
consumers. The strategy recommended was to introduce water utilities to private&#13;
sector management options, encouraging them to fully commercialize their&#13;
operations, regrouping smaller municipal water utilities into regional service areas,&#13;
and establishing an independent office to regulate all water utilities.&#13;
4 While supply bottlenecks are severe in Philippine water utilities, there is considerable room for efficiency&#13;
gains by improving the management of water distribution systems through private sector&#13;
involvement. Non-revenue water estimates range from around 60% in MWSS to around 30% in some&#13;
of the more efficiently run Water Districts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
(ii) Recognizing that the resources needed to bridge the excess demand for water and&#13;
sanitation services were beyond public financing capacity. The strategy recommended&#13;
was to require all regulatory agencies to fix water tariffs so that they fully covered&#13;
the costs of delivering service, and to undertake specific facilitative measures at the&#13;
government level in order to induce private investments into both water supply&#13;
production and distribution.&#13;
(iii) Reorienting public sector financing arrangements so the Government need not&#13;
spend its scarce resources on water utilities that had the potential of being&#13;
commercially self-supporting. The strategy recommended was to encourage large,&#13;
commercially viable water utilities to graduate from concessionary financing of their&#13;
projects, and encourage them to seek market-based financing instead.&#13;
(iv) Recognizing that the increased quantity of water supplied was generating massive&#13;
quantities of untreated wastewater, and polluting cities and surrounding water bodies.&#13;
The strategy recommended was to support public sector investments in sewerage and&#13;
sanitation provided these were cost-effective and financially sustainable.&#13;
1.13  In 1994, the NEDA Board,5 passed resolutions Nos. 4 and 5, which laid out&#13;
national policies for water supply and sanitation. Resolution No. 4 called for more&#13;
efficient management of water resources. It also encouraged private sector participation,&#13;
in order to share the burden of financing water supply infrastructure in high growth&#13;
regions and redirect scarce public resources toward other national priorities. Resolution&#13;
No. 5 addressed the growing problem of pollution from human waste, stating that&#13;
sewerage and sanitation investments would be made on the basis of demand (i.e. on local&#13;
preferences and willingness to pay for services) from the LGUs and residents.&#13;
C. Government Strategy and Programs&#13;
1.14 The Government involved all key stakeholders before finalizing the sectoral&#13;
strategy. In December 1994, the President convened a water summit in Manila attended&#13;
by key members of the Congress, administration, water utilities and the public. The&#13;
summit provided an opportunity for stakeholders from all levels (the Congress,&#13;
Administration, Water Utilities, LGUs, NGOs and Consumer Groups) to discuss and&#13;
debate the issues and strategies raised in the Water Sector Review. It endorsed the NEDA&#13;
Board's broad policy recommendations to tackle the problem of rapidly deteriorating&#13;
water and sanitation services in urban centers. A Water Management Cluster or Cabinet&#13;
Cluster G was established, which had the mandate of promoting private sector&#13;
participation, improving efficiency of public water utilities and encouraging LGUs to&#13;
invest in sewerage and sanitation.&#13;
The NEDA Board is the highest policy advisory committee, and is chaired by the President of the&#13;
Philippines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
1.15  The summit endorsed the Government strategy of tackling two sets of priorities&#13;
simultaneously. First, to create an enabling environment for a large and rapid infusion of&#13;
private investments in water supply, so as to meet expanding demand in an economically&#13;
efficient and sustainable way. Second, to invest in sanitation infrastructure outside&#13;
Manila in a demand-driven, financially sustainable and technologically cost-effective&#13;
manner. Addressing these challenges became the centerpiece of Government strategy&#13;
and programs from 1995 onward.&#13;
1.16  In June 1995, aNational Water Crisis Act (RA 8041) was passed that gave the&#13;
Executive Branch special powers to improve the overall management of water resources,&#13;
and to address specific water problems in Metro Manila. The Act provided an impetus to&#13;
privatize MWSS. The Joint Executive-Legislative Water Crisis Commission, which was&#13;
established under the Act, also made a comprehensive set of recommendations with&#13;
regard to all water utilities in the country. The Commission recommended that:&#13;
* the inefficiencies in the production and distribution of publicly-funded water&#13;
supply be addressed immediately since they drain funds from the financially-&#13;
strapped national budget.&#13;
D the institutional and regulatory framework be made consistent with the policy goal&#13;
of encouraging private sector participation. The current fragmented&#13;
responsibilities among regulatory agencies makes it difficult both to attract private&#13;
investors and protect consumers from the monopoly power of private providers.&#13;
* the Government operationalize its policy to develop sewerage infrastructure (as&#13;
outlined by the NEDA Board Resolution No. 5) in a demand-driven and cost-&#13;
effective manner.&#13;
1.17  These recommendations -- which are consistent with the Bank's assessment of the&#13;
key sector issues -- have formed the basis of developing the Water Districts Development&#13;
Project. While the project was being prepared, technical assistance was extended to the&#13;
Government to clarify the basic institutional and regulatory framework consistent the&#13;
Joint Commission recommendations. During project implementation financing will&#13;
support (i) the piloting of a Public Performance Audit System in MWSS, with a view to&#13;
extend system to other Philippine water utilities in the subsequent phase and (ii)&#13;
undertake sewerage, sanitation and drainage investments in five cities, so that a cross-&#13;
section of Philippine secondary cities is able to make a serious attempt at tackling local&#13;
environmental priorities in a cost-effective and financially sustainable manner.&#13;

D. Lessons From Previous Bank Operations&#13;
1.18  The World Bank's urban water sector lending program in the Philippines over the&#13;
last two decades has largely focused on the MWSS or the Metro Manila area. It has&#13;
supported four loans for water supply and one for sewerage since 1978, totaling US$264&#13;
million, with the Second Manila Sewerage Project (US$56.8 million) awaiting loan&#13;
effectiveness. Outside the metro area, the Bank financed the Provincial Cities Water&#13;
Supply Project for US$23 million (Loan 1415-PH) to improve water supply in five towns&#13;
of Luzon, and the Water Supply in Provincial Towns Project for $38 million (Loan&#13;
1710/Credit 920-PH) in 1979. The Water Supply component of the Second Subic Bay&#13;
Freeport Project (Loan 3745-PH) is US$32.6 million. In rural water supply, the Rural&#13;
Water Supply Project for US$35.5 million (Loan 2206-PH) and the First Water Supply,&#13;
Sewerage and Sanitation Sector Project for US$85 million (Loan 3242-PH) were&#13;
financed in 1982 and 1990, respectively. All the above non-MWSS projects, except for&#13;
the First Water Supply, Sewerage and Sanitation Sector Project and the recently approved&#13;
Second Subic Bay Freeport Project, have been completed.&#13;
1.19 Evaluations of earlier Bank or IDA-financed water supply projects outside Metro&#13;
Manila were responsible for shifting Bank assistance from project lending to economic&#13;
and sector work in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This work indicated that project&#13;
performance was hurt by the absence of a well-articulated sectoral policy framework, the&#13;
lack of transparent financing criteria, inadequate management incentives to run water&#13;
utilities as commercial enterprises, and political interference in the setting of water tariffs&#13;
to fully cover costs of delivering services.6 These issues are currently being addressed&#13;
through both project and policy support from the Bank to the Government of the&#13;
Philippines.&#13;
E. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.20  The project design is consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS) for the Philippines, a significant element of which is to strengthen infrastructure&#13;
and facilitate private sector participation. In the water sector, Bank technical assistance&#13;
and lending will help rationalize the management of water utilities, promote private&#13;
sector participation and broaden the access of urban populations to safe and reliable water&#13;
supply and sanitation services. The project, along with its companion LGU Urban Water&#13;
and Sanitation Project, will also address other elements of the CAS, notably by assisting&#13;
LGUs build institutional capacity to undertake decentralized decisions on local&#13;
infrastructural investments. The bulk of sewerage investments in the project will be&#13;
undertaken in Mindanao cities, where peace has returned recently after years of civil&#13;
strife.&#13;
6The problems were most acute in the case of MWSS, which has absorbed a significant share of public&#13;
investment funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
1.21  Philippine water sector developments described in paragraphs 1.12 through 1.17&#13;
above are also significant from a global perspective. They mirror trends across the world&#13;
in developing countries, and along with them, the evolution of Bank sectoral policies. In&#13;
the 1970s and 1980s, sector policies in most countries advocated investment support to&#13;
build technical, financial and institutional capacity in publicly-managed water utilities.&#13;
These policies were questioned in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the Bank's&#13;
project performance evaluations and surveys of water users indicated that both on equity&#13;
and efficiency grounds, sectoral investments often failed to accomplish the stated&#13;
objectives. In terms of equity, the poor received the least satisfactory services, paid the&#13;
highest unit prices for water, and had to rely on market-based informal vending (at very&#13;
high unit costs) for their daily needs. In terms of efficiency, publicly managed water&#13;
utilities had high proportions of unaccounted for water, were generally unable to recover&#13;
costs for sewerage, and invariably had inadequate management incentives to operate as&#13;
commercial enterprises.&#13;
1.22 The search began, in many countries --just as it did in the Philippines -- to find&#13;
more sustainable solutions. This led to the recommendation to switch the role of the&#13;
public agencies from providers to facilitators, to encourage management and operation&#13;
on commercial principles, so as to be able to serve their customers in a responsive and&#13;
accountable manner. These recommendations were summarized in the Bank's Water&#13;
Resources Management Policy principles of (a) providing water and sanitation services&#13;
on the basis of demand, and (b) managing the services at the lowest level.&#13;
1.23  The rationale for Bank involvement, therefore, not only reflects the Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy, but also the importance of Philippine sectoral developments in the&#13;
global context. The Bank has played a key supportive role in the Government's attempt&#13;
to implement new sectoral policies. Efforts by MWSS to privatize its water supply and&#13;
sanitation services, the attempts at actually implementing the NEDA Board resolutions,&#13;
and the policies to decentralize decision-making to city and community levels are all&#13;
being closely watched by sector professionals around the world. The rationale for the&#13;
Bank's continued involvement is to assist the Government bring to a successful&#13;
completion the far-reaching changes taking place both in regard to water supply and&#13;
sanitation provision. There has as much to gain by its involvement in the Philippine water&#13;
sector, in terms of distilling the lessons for other countries of the world, as it has to offer&#13;
the Government of the Philippines through its technical assistance and investment&#13;
support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Rationale&#13;
2.1   The challenge facing the Government is in implementing the sectoral policy&#13;
changes that have been announced so far. As mentioned in the earlier section, the most&#13;
significant element has already been implemented in 1995, when the Government decided&#13;
to privatize MWSS through two concession contracts for water supply and sewerage&#13;
infrastructure. A very high level of investor interest was expressed for these contracts,&#13;
and a privatized MWSS is expected to start functioning by August 1, 1997. The question&#13;
facing the Government now is how best to replicate similar institutional and&#13;
organizational changes in other smaller cities and towns around the country.&#13;
2.2   The project rationale is that some key strategic investments in institutions and&#13;
infrastructure, supported by Bank financing, could lay the basis for future investments in&#13;
secondary cities and towns through re-designed water and sanitation policies. With regard&#13;
to sewerage and sanitation -- in which the private sector is not expected to substitute for&#13;
public investments -- project investments would enable the Government develop and&#13;
prototype cost-effective, financially sustainable methods of improving urban sanitation.&#13;
With regard to water supply, in which the private sector is expected to substitute for or&#13;
provide complementary financing to public investments, the program of support is&#13;
somewhat more complex, and entails a mix of institution-building (for developing an&#13;
appropriate regulatory framework, encouraging all water utilities adopt commercial&#13;
practices), and infrastructure investment support (in water utilities that are too small to&#13;
attract private investors and operators). Thus, in both water supply and sanitation,&#13;
project support is justified on the ground that it will enable the Government to lay the&#13;
groundwork for a meaningful long-term investment program in line with the policy&#13;
announcements, discussed in paragraphs 1.12, 1.13 and 1.16 above. The program entails&#13;
two Bank-financed projects; the proposed Water Districts Development Project and the&#13;
companion LGU Urban Water and Sanitation Project that will follow in 1998.&#13;
2.3   For sewerage and sanitation, the key constraint has been in developing usable&#13;
rules and procedures (both technical and financial) that would lead to cost-effective and&#13;
sustainable services. The project will attempt to prototype technical, financial and&#13;
institutional procedures in consultation with participating LGUs of four pre-selected&#13;
cities. The challenge has been to persuade city residents and LGU administrations that&#13;
local environmental problems created by untreated wastewater need to be tackled on a&#13;
priority basis, as well as demonstrate how these can be done within the existing municipal&#13;
budgetary constraints. Local decision makers have determined whether the sewerage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
infrastructure fits with local priorities and willingness to pay (of the LGU administration,&#13;
community and individuals served). The project would accomplish its goals if, on its&#13;
completion, the sewerage program is replicated in other secondary cities facing similar&#13;
environmental pollution problems.&#13;
2.4   For water supply, four critical bottlenecks have been identified that could hinder&#13;
the Government's strategy:&#13;
(i) The fragmented regulatory arrangements in the water sector require&#13;
consolidation, so that all water utilities operate under a transparent regulatory&#13;
framework. This would help commercialize water utilities, while protecting the&#13;
interests of low income water supply consumers.&#13;
(ii) Potential investors need reliable and updated financial and technical&#13;
information on water utilities that offered good prospects for private sector&#13;
participation, before they can seriously consider bidding for concession and BOT&#13;
contracts.&#13;
(iii) The water utilities need technical assistance to: (a) evaluate private sector&#13;
participation options, that best suited to the organizational interests, prepare&#13;
bidding documents; (b) prepare negotiate and complete transactions that get the&#13;
private sector involved in service provision.&#13;
(iv) Consumers have to be assured that private sector participation would indeed&#13;
expand services efficiently and equitably.&#13;
2.5   The first of the above four bottlenecks was addressed during project preparation,&#13;
when the Bank, in association with the ADB and USAID, provided technical assistance to&#13;
the Government in the area of regulatory reform. The Government intends introducing a&#13;
Bill before the Congress in 1997 to establish a National Water Regulatory Commission,&#13;
incorporating the recommendations of the technical assistance. The remaining three&#13;
issues listed above will be supported by specific actions under various other technical&#13;
assistance initiatives supported by the World Bank and other donor agencies. Of these,&#13;
the piloting of a Public Performance Audit (PPA) system in MWSS is being financed&#13;
under the proposed project.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
2.6   The project objectives are:&#13;
*  To help participating LGUs and water districts plan and implement sewerage and&#13;
sanitation investments based on their residents' wishes and willingness to pay.&#13;
*  To assist the Government of the Philippines in developing a transparent regulatory&#13;
mechanisms in order to facilitate private sector participation in water utilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
2.7   Thus, the project will deliver sustainable water and sanitation services through&#13;
two types of interventions. For sewerage, sanitation and drainage, project investments are&#13;
being developed collaboratively with households, communities and city councils, so that&#13;
the technical staff can respond to community needs fully. For water supply, investments&#13;
through a technical assistance loan will assist MWSS develop a Public Performance&#13;
Audit system that provides reliable and timely feedback from service consumers on the&#13;
level of satisfaction with the services.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
2.8   The project consists of two components, to be financed by two loans. The first&#13;
loan of US$2.3 million would finance the Public Performance Audit (PPA component).&#13;
The PPA component comprises technical assistance designed to pilot and field-test a&#13;
privatized public performance audit system. This component will enhance the regulation&#13;
of water utilities by piloting and testing a public performance audit system for the&#13;
privatized operations of MWSS. Independent auditors will monitor, evaluate and publicly&#13;
report the performance of the two concessionaires who have been awarded the contracts&#13;
to manage metro Manila's water supply and sanitation infrastructure. The lessons learned&#13;
will be utilized to operationalize the system in MWSS, and extend it to other water&#13;
utilities in the country.&#13;
2.9   The second loan of US$54.5 million will finance the Sewerage, Sanitation and&#13;
Drainage component (the SSD component). The SSD component consists of the&#13;
construction of sewerage, sanitation and drainage infrastructure in the cities of Davao,&#13;
Cotabato, Calamba, and Cagayan de Oro. Sewerage feasibility reports for the initial&#13;
service areas in each city were prepared between 1992-1995, and updated in 1996. The&#13;
engineering design will adopt a demand-based approach, in which City Councils and&#13;
residents in project areas will be presented with service options and asked to select the&#13;
option that suits their preferences and willingness to pay. In order to operate and&#13;
maintain the new facilities in a sustainable manner, local water districts will be closely&#13;
involved in the design and implementation of the project. A memorandum of agreement&#13;
will be signed between the LGU administration of each participating city and the local&#13;
water district specifying the details of a management contract for operating and&#13;
maintaining the sewerage systems by the latter (see Annex 11). A sewerage surcharge&#13;
will be added to the water bills of all connected residents. This surcharge will be adequate&#13;
to cover all routine operations and maintenance activities for the sewerage infrastructure.7&#13;
In the event any re-structuring or re-organization of operations of these water districts&#13;
affects the performance of their obligations under the memoranda of agreement, the&#13;
Government would consult with the Bank on how best the existing arrangements can be&#13;
sustained.&#13;
As water supply and sewerage will be a part of the same bill, failure to pay the sewerage surcharge will&#13;
lead to the turning off of the water supply connection. However, in order to prevent hardship to low&#13;
income consumers only relatively large volume water users are required to connect to the sewerage&#13;
system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
2.10 Before investments in sewerage and sanitation are made, the project will assess&#13;
stakeholder demand at both the user and community level in the detailed engineering&#13;
design phase. User demand is established by consulting with beneficiaries and&#13;
community demand is ascertained by consulting with LGUs at the barangay and city&#13;
council levels. Their preferences were evaluated against the LGUs' capacity to borrow&#13;
for sewerage investments. For this purpose, a long-term financial planning model was&#13;
developed to help city councils understand the budget implications of borrowing for the&#13;
project. The key consideration was that stakeholders who pay for the investments should&#13;
perceive tangible net benefits. Because of this approach, substantial changes in the&#13;
project scope and composition became necessary during preparation. For example:&#13;
* LGUs of Dagupan, Roxas City and General Santos declined to participate, despite&#13;
initial interest.&#13;
*  Users preferred direct connections to sewers, so as not to pass through existing&#13;
septic tanks.&#13;
I Davao substantially altered the Consultant's proposals to address the city&#13;
council's concern that the only relatively unpolluted beach in Toril needed to be&#13;
safeguarded.&#13;
Desian Consideration&#13;
2.11  Considerations for technical soundness and cost-effectiveness have led to the&#13;
choice of "simplified sewerage" design standards. Similar considerations led to: (a)&#13;
offering users the choice between backyard and property front locations for collection&#13;
sewers; (b) reducing the size and length of collection and transportation sewers; (c)&#13;
minimizing the use of lift stations and force mains, and (d) minimizing dislocation of&#13;
traffic during construction.&#13;
2.12 For sewage and septage treatment, design considerations sought to minimize land&#13;
requirements yet ensure that investment and operating costs were low, and that the quality&#13;
of effluents met national standards. The Advanced Integrated Pond System (AIPS) meets&#13;
these requirements, because it is a compact up-flow system with an anaerobic zone below&#13;
a facultative zone. Also, providing for recirculation leads to an algae-rich aerobic zone on&#13;
the top. The AIPS is designed to prevent mixing between anaerobic and other zones in&#13;
the pond; this arrangement results in improved efficiency in anaerobic digestion, and&#13;
produces little odor and low rates of sludge accumulation.&#13;
2.13  Based on considerations of cost-effectiveness, reliability and simplicity of O&amp;M,&#13;
Ventilated Improved Pit (VIP) latrines and pour flush toilets were chosen for on-site&#13;
sanitation for both individual and communal use. Similar considerations formed the basis&#13;
of the design for project implementation, arrangements for O&amp;M, and cost recovery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
2.14   Because the estimated costs for full coverage were high, it was decided the project&#13;
would be introduced in the towns of Davao, Calamba, Cagayan de Oro, Cotabato City&#13;
Dagupan, Roxas City and General Santos City. The LGU administrations of the last&#13;
three cities, however, decided not to participate in the project at different stages of project&#13;
preparation.8&#13;
D. Estimated Costs and Financing&#13;
2.15 Public Performance Audit Component (PPA). The estimated base cost is&#13;
US$2.5 million (approximately 5% of total base costs). A Bank loan of US$2.3 million&#13;
to Government and on lent to MWSS will be used in the first year to set up the PPA&#13;
system. It was not considered necessary to include price contingencies for the PPA&#13;
component, as this component will be fully disbursed in the first year of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
2.16 Sewerage, Sanitation and Drainage component (SSD). The estimated base cost&#13;
is P1434.6 million or US$51.9 million (approximately 95% of total base costs) with a&#13;
foreign exchange component of US$12.7 million, or P332.2 million. Physical&#13;
contingencies represent about 16% of cost of civil works, while price contingencies are&#13;
about 19% in the US dollar cost estimates.9 Price contingencies and interest during&#13;
construction were applied on base costs bringing the total of the SSD component to an&#13;
estimated US$78.26 million. Table 2.2 summarizes costs estimates and details (see&#13;
Annex 2). These costs are inclusive of taxes and duties.&#13;

After Roxas City declined to participate, the project did not have LGU representation from the Visayas.&#13;
Three of the four project cities (Davao, Cotabato city and Cagayan de Oro are from Mindanao, and&#13;
the remaining town of Calamba is from Luzon. However, the four towns represent a typical cross-&#13;
section of Philippine secondary towns both in terms of population size and in terms of environmental&#13;
problems. Annex I B provides details on the towns.&#13;
9Physical contingencies have been kept at 10 per cent, based on experience gathered implementing&#13;
demand-based sewerage projects. Cost data from engineering feasibility studies tend to over-estimate&#13;
costs because homeowners in residential neighborhoods may decline to participate in the project. The&#13;
project design assumes that about 60 per cent of potential customers will connect to the sewer system&#13;
(only high volume water consumers will be required to connect to the system).&#13;

2.17  The proposed financing plan is shown in Table 2.3. The Bank will finance&#13;
US$56.8 million through two loans: US$2.3 million lent to the Republic of the&#13;
Philippines, and further on lent to MWSS for the PPA component, and US$54.5 million&#13;
lent to LBP and further on lent to the four participating cities for the SSD component.&#13;
2.18 The loan for the PPA component will cover 92% of total costs, inclusive of 100%&#13;
of foreign exchange costs, with MWSS and the GOP financing the remaining 8% of&#13;
costs. The Government of the Philippines would be the borrower of this loan, and will on&#13;
lend the proceeds to MWSS through a subsidiary loan agreement.&#13;
2.19 The loan for the sewerage, sanitation and drainage will cover about 70% of total&#13;
costs, including 100% of foreign exchange costs and about 75% of estimated local costs.&#13;
The sewerage loan provides for financing in part, interest during construction, estimated&#13;
at $10.5 million, given the long construction periods and the cash flow conditions of&#13;
participating LGUs. The remaining US$23.7 million or 30% of project costs would be&#13;
financed by participating LGUs from their budgets, and by users of sewerage services.&#13;
The borrower would be the Land Bank of Philippines, with the Republic of the&#13;
Philippines as the guarantor. Funds would be on lent under subsidiary loan agreements to&#13;
participating LGUs. Execution of subsidiary loan agreements between GOP and MWSS,&#13;
and between LBP and at least two of the participating LGUs (one of which must be&#13;
Davao), will be a condition of effectiveness of the loan to the GOP and the loan to LBP,&#13;
respectively. The two proposed loans would be onlent for 20 years, inclusive of a five-&#13;
year grace period, as US$ single currency loans.&#13;

E. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
2.20 Project implementation will be a joint effort involving the national agencies,&#13;
LGUs and water utilities. The project's two components will have separate&#13;
implementation arrangements. For the PPA component, the MWSS Board of Directors&#13;
will supervise implementation. Day to day supervision will be exercised by the MWSS&#13;
Regulatory Office, which has been established to monitor the concession contracts. The&#13;
lessons learned from the piloting phase that the PPA component is financing, will be&#13;
documented by November 1998, and utilized by MWSS as an instrument to improve the&#13;
transparency of the regulatory system. The lessons learned from the program will also be&#13;
utilized to develop a PPA program for other water utilities in the Philippines (both Water&#13;
Districts and LGU-managed water utilities). Technical assistance will also be provided by&#13;
the Bank through regular mission support, in order to evaluate how best the methodology&#13;
developed can be replicated in the water districts and other water utilities throughout the&#13;
country.&#13;
2.21 For the SSD component, the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), LWUA and the&#13;
four cities will be responsible for overall implementation. LBP will establish a project&#13;
management office (PMO) in Davao city, headed by a project manager appointed by&#13;
LBP, which would be responsible for directing, supervising and coordinating all project&#13;
activities under the SSD component of the project. Technical support would be provided&#13;
to the PMO by the Central Sewerage and Sanitation PTogram Support Office (CPSO) of&#13;
the LWUA. A team of internationally-recruited design and supervision consultants&#13;
financed under the project would be retained by the PMO during project implementation&#13;
to ensure that the proposed design for participation is carried out (Annexes 12 and 13).&#13;
10 The negative amounts shown in the financing from internal sources reflect a reimbursement to the LGUs&#13;
for installation costs absorbed in prior years and passed on to users.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
The establishment of the PMO by LBP and of a PMU by at least two participating LGUs,&#13;
one of which must be Davao, will be conditions of effectiveness. The PMU -- consisting&#13;
of the City Engineer, Director of City Planning, Director of the Budget Office, and a&#13;
representative of the water district -- will supervise design and construction at the city&#13;
level. Details of organization, staffing and management are described in Annex 9.&#13;
2.22 Project implementation would start in the fourth quarter of 1997, and would be&#13;
completed after about five years (see Annex 5 for the implementation schedule).&#13;
F. Monitoring, Evaluation and Report Requirements&#13;
2.23  The project represents an attempt to translate sector policy into actions, for which&#13;
a "learning by doing" approach is critical. For the PPA component, assistance will be&#13;
closely monitored by the national Government level, as a possible instrument to ensure&#13;
transparency in regulatory processes. For the SSD component, lessons learned need to be&#13;
fed back to improve future phases of project implementation. Participation by&#13;
stakeholders in the consultations will become a critical ingredient. The monitoring and&#13;
evaluation system will address the specific requirements of a participative project design.&#13;
Details of the proposed monitoring and evaluation system are in Annex 9. In each of the&#13;
two loans, the borrower and/or the implementing entities will covenant to monitor and&#13;
evaluate the implementation of the respective components of the project in accordance&#13;
with indicators acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
2.24  It is expected that the project performance indicators will monitor the traditional&#13;
project milestones (measuring progress achieved against specific financial and physical&#13;
targets), and process indicators will track to what extent the stakeholders (communities,&#13;
private operators, LGUs, water districts and national agencies) views have been reflected&#13;
in the design of the project components. At the end of each phase of the project, the&#13;
lessons learned will be evaluated and used to change or modify the next phase of project&#13;
design.&#13;
2.25 LBP would send the Bank (i) no later than March 31 and September 30 of each&#13;
project year, beginning March 31, 1998, semi-annual project progress reports, including&#13;
revised project cost estimates and implementing schedules, (ii) no later than March 31 of&#13;
each project year, beginning March 31, 1998, the annual budget appropriations of&#13;
participating LGUs, and (iii) no later than six months after the project is completed, the&#13;
evaluation report on project implementation.&#13;
G. Land Acquisition and Resettlement for the Sewerage Component&#13;
2.26  Land will need to be acquired for construction of sewage treatment facilities,&#13;
pumping stations and for communal toilet facilities in the participating cities. The largest&#13;
requirement of land is for construction of sewage treatment facilities. The proposed sites&#13;
have been identified and visited and no resettlement is anticipated (see Annex 7, Section&#13;
VII) because the lands on those sites are currently unoccupied. The sites for sewage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
treatment plants will be purchased from private owners at negotiated market price.&#13;
Relatively small parcels of land will also be required for the construction of pumping&#13;
stations, and will also be acquired through negotiated market purchase. The present&#13;
understanding is that these will not involve displacement or dislocation, as there is some&#13;
flexibility with regard to the exact location of the pumping stations. The alignments of&#13;
the sewer lines will be finalized during the detailed engineering design, and will be along&#13;
public right of way (such as sidewalks, roads, public parks etc.) in order to avoid any&#13;
displacement or dislocation. Communal toilet facilities will be sited on vacant lands in&#13;
low-income neighborhoods. The lands will also be acquired at negotiated market&#13;
purchase. The project will follow a participatory approach to planning and&#13;
implementation, (see Annex 12); thus, any potential dislocation of residents and/or loss&#13;
of incomes will be reported to the project implementation team.&#13;
2.27 No displacement or dislocation is anticipated during project implementation for&#13;
the reasons discussed in paragraph 2.26 above. The specific alignment of sewer lines and&#13;
collection networks, as well as the location of pumping stations will be known after the&#13;
detailed engineering design is completed. In each case the implementing entities will&#13;
carry out site-specific review of impacts. As mentioned above, there is flexibility in the&#13;
location of the pumping stations, and therefore the final location will be selected to avoid&#13;
displacement or dislocation. The sewer lines will be located under public rights of way.&#13;
Nevertheless, construction may cause temporary dislocation or dismantling of existing&#13;
structures along the rights of way. LBP will establish guidelines for compensation in the&#13;
event of involuntary dislocation or dismantling of existing structures, in order to ensure&#13;
that they conform with Bank policies on involuntary resettlement. Further, as a condition&#13;
of disbursement of its respective subsidiary loan, the relevant LGU will have to provide&#13;
evidence satisfactory to the Bank of its compliance with these guidelines.&#13;
H. Environmental Impact&#13;
2.28  Project design is driven by the quest to find a sustainable solution to the many&#13;
environmental problems caused by inadequate management of water resources in the&#13;
country's rapidly growing secondary cities.&#13;
2.29 The PPA component would address the twin problems of poor coverage and&#13;
unreliable water supply in urban areas. Through technical assistance, the project would&#13;
bring in the private sector which, by operating more efficiently, is expected to improve&#13;
and expand services. The SSD component will improve urban environmental conditions&#13;
in the areas served by the sewerage and sanitation systems. A summary environmental&#13;
assessment is presented in Annex 8.&#13;
2.30 At present, it is impossible to evaluate the downstream environmental impact of&#13;
increased private sector participation in water utilities; however, the Government's&#13;
commitment to establish a public performance audit system, and the National Water&#13;
Regulatory Commission are strong signals that adverse environmental impacts will be&#13;
closely monitored.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
2.31  The SSD component will mitigate severe environmental problems caused by&#13;
poorly operated sanitation and waste water infrastructure in the participating cities&#13;
(evidence from all the cities indicates that urban land and surrounding water bodies are&#13;
severely contaminated by untreated sewage).&#13;
2.32  Environmental conditions in the four cities were assessed, particularly for the sites&#13;
proposed for the construction of the wastewater treatment plants: Past experience in&#13;
many countries suggests that these plants are often poorly maintained, that in a number of&#13;
years, they cease to operate properly and the surrounding area becomes badly&#13;
contaminated. To reduce the possibility this could occur, the project will apply treatment&#13;
technology that is relatively easy to maintain.&#13;
2.33 An EIA for Davao city has been reviewed by the Bank, and is serving as a model&#13;
for the other participating cities. In addition, an EIA Process Guidance Summary and&#13;
generic terms of reference for conducting EIAs in the remaining project cities have been&#13;
prepared. EIAs for at least two participating LGUs will be completed as a condition of&#13;
effectiveness,&#13;
2.34 The Davao EIA suggests that minor negative impacts will be experienced in the&#13;
four cities during construction and operation of the facilities. During construction, these&#13;
will include short-term air, water and noise pollution and disturbances to traffic and&#13;
commercial activities. These will be mitigated by a rational planning and scheduling of&#13;
construction, and by developing and enforcing strict pollution control regulations for the&#13;
project sites. As conditions of loan effectiveness at least two participating LGUs - one of&#13;
which being Davao - would have completed their EIAs. The remaining LGUs are&#13;
required to complete EIAs as conditions of disbursement under their respective subsidiary&#13;
loan agreements with LBP.&#13;
2.35  During the operational phase, negative impacts could include environmental&#13;
hazards due to accidents (either man-made from design failures, spills or fires) or natural&#13;
disasters (such as typhoons), water pollution and noise pollution. The project is&#13;
involving the local water district to operate and maintain the facilities because these&#13;
utilities have adequate technical and financial expertise. In addition, by involving&#13;
communities in decision-making, the public will be more aware of any problems that may&#13;
occur and can then pressure authorities to address them. Further, DENR's local offices&#13;
are expected to strictly monitor water quality standards for effluents. To ensure such&#13;
compliance, communities will have the information they need to voice their concerns.&#13;
Moreover, because the treatment technology is odor-free and the plants will only deal&#13;
with human waste (as opposed to toxic or industrial waste), city governments expect to&#13;
develop the areas around the plants for recreational purposes (such as parks and golf&#13;
courses).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
I. Procurement&#13;
2.36 Procurement will follow Bank guidelines as presented in "Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (January 1995, revised January and&#13;
August 1996). The Procurement Plan is described in Annex 5. Standard bidding&#13;
documents and standard bid evaluation report will be used for procurement of works and&#13;
goods under international competitive bidding (ICB).&#13;
2.37 For the PPA component, consultants will be hired to implement specific tasks of&#13;
establishing a methodology for conducting future public performance audits. They will&#13;
be recruited according to the provisions of the "Guidelines for Selection and Employment&#13;
of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January, 1997). The standard contract for&#13;
consultants, produced in June 1995, will be used.&#13;
2.38 For the SSD component, at the national level, the PMO will be assisted by a&#13;
design and supervision consultant for the length of the project, and by CPSO. At the&#13;
local level, the PMU will be responsible for procuring its own goods and works. The&#13;
PMU will also be assisted by a consultant to prepare the prequalification documents,&#13;
contract bid packages, tender documents and specifications for goods and civil works.&#13;
Bid evaluations will be performed by the PMU and reviewed by the PMO, with help from&#13;
the national consultant and CPSO. According to the local government code, the&#13;
Prequalification, Bids and Awards Committee (PBAC) of each LGU will ultimately be&#13;
responsible for awarding the contract. PBAC will also follow the timetable set by law for&#13;
each step of the bidding process, according to Administrative Order 129. Foreign&#13;
bidders will be eligible to participate in national competitive bidding (NCB).&#13;
2.39 The PMUs of the participating cities will implement the Environmental&#13;
Management Plan (EMP), guided by the PMO. The plan will be integrated into bidding&#13;
and contract documents, and the contractor responsible for project activities will be&#13;
required to monitor the environment. The PMO will be responsible for monitoring and&#13;
reporting compliance, with the assistance of CPSO-LWUA and the project Consultant&#13;
team (described in Annex 8).&#13;
2.40 The design and supervision consultant will be hired according to Bank guidelines.&#13;
LBP, through the PMO, will be responsible for procuring consulting services for design&#13;
and supervision in all four cities. Technical assistance, to short-list consultants as well as&#13;
evaluate proposals, will be provided by LWUA through the CPSO. LBP and LWUA&#13;
have been involved in several Bank-assisted projects, and are considered to have the&#13;
experience needed to select consultants under Bank guidelines. A draft terms of&#13;
reference for this consultancy is presented in Annex 12.&#13;
2.41  Project expenditure items, their estimated costs, and proposed methods of&#13;
procurement, are summarized in Table 2.4 and discussed below.&#13;

2.42 Works. Very small works, estimated to cost less than $200,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract, for the construction of on-site or communal sanitation facilities will be procured,&#13;
up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $6,970,000 equivalent, through force accounts&#13;
by each participating LGU or by means of other government procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. Participation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) would be acceptable.&#13;
Works for the construction of the sewerage system, which will include providing and&#13;
installing equipment, in four packages (one for each city), will be procured under&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB). In Davao, the civil works could involve two&#13;
packages: one for Poblacion and one for Toril. Civil works packages for drainage in&#13;
Cotabato City, estimated to cost less than $2,260,000 equivalent will be procured: (a) for&#13;
contracts below $50,000, up to an aggregate amount of $300,000 equivalent, through&#13;
national shopping procedures of obtaining quotations from at least 3 qualified&#13;
contractors; (b) for contracts equal or above $50,000, but limited to contracts amounting&#13;
to $500,000 per package through NCB following procedures acceptable to the Bank. In&#13;
both instances, the standard Contract Documents for procurement of very small works&#13;
and small works would be used.&#13;
2.43   Goods. Procurement of maintenance equipment and spares for all the four cities&#13;
will be in bulk and through ICB which could be handled by the PMO, coordinated with&#13;
II Includes physical, price contingencies and interest during construction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
all PMUs and with the help of the consultant and CPSO. For procurement under ICB&#13;
procedures, domestic goods would be allowed a preference margin of 15% of CIF bid&#13;
price or the amount of customs duties, whichever is lower for bid evaluation.&#13;
2.44 Consultant service. Consultant services, estimated at US$8.66 million, will be&#13;
needed to support project implementation. Of this, $2.3 million will be for the PPA&#13;
components, which will be open to qualified international and local firms. The terms of&#13;
reference for evaluating bids have been by MWSS, with technical assistance from the&#13;
Bank. The reimaining $6.10 million will be for the SSD component. Selection for the&#13;
Consultant contracts for the SSD component will be open to groups of international and&#13;
local firms including NGOs, or a combination of all of them, which will be evaluated&#13;
according to the draft TOR (as presented in Annex 12). The TOR will specify four&#13;
schedules, one per city, and have an accounting of the cost per city. Training will be part&#13;
of the consultant's TOR.&#13;
2.45 Land Compensation. These items, estimated at US$13.66 million will be&#13;
financed by LGU counterpart funds. Approximately 70 percent of this represents land&#13;
acquisition costs in Davao and Cagayan de Oro for the sewage treatment plant sites.&#13;
2.46 Procurement review. Works amounting to US$5 million and over, or goods of&#13;
US$1 million and over, will be subject to prior review by the Bank (approximately equal&#13;
to 84% of Bank-financed cost). In addition, the first bidding packages for goods and&#13;
works for each of the participating cities, regardless of value, will be subject to the&#13;
Bank's prior review. The Bank will review other contracts for goods and works on a&#13;
random sample basis (one out of five contracts for goods), after they have been awarded.&#13;
The post reviews will be carried out by the Bank's Resident Mission in the Philippines.&#13;
For procurement of goods and works through ICB, the Bank's Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents would be used; for procurement through NCB, bidding documents submitted&#13;
by LGU with the first bidding package for goods and works, would be reviewed and, if&#13;
acceptable, the same bidding documents would be used for all subsequent NCB&#13;
procurement. All consultancy contracts will be subject to prior review except for those&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$100,000 for employment of consulting firms or&#13;
US$50,000 for employment of individuals. For the exceptions, prior Bank review shall be&#13;
required for termns of reference for such contracts, sole source procurement, assignments&#13;
of critical nature, and amendments to contracts raising their value above the threshold&#13;
limits.&#13;
J. Disbursements, Accounts and Audits&#13;
2.47 Proceeds of the Bank loan will be disbursed against: (a) 100% of foreign&#13;
expenditures for civil works; (b) 79% of local expenditures for civil works; (c) 100% of&#13;
local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured equipment and materials, or 65%&#13;
of local expenditures for other equipment and materials procured locally, 100% of foreign&#13;
expenditures, and (d) 100% of total expenditures for consultant services, training and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
studies. The section below discusses arrangements with respect to the sewerage&#13;
component.&#13;
2.48 Disbursements would be made on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOE)&#13;
for actual expenditures against (a) contracts of less than US$5 million equivalent for civil&#13;
works, (b) contracts of less than US$1 million equivalent for goods, and (c) consultant's&#13;
contracts of less than US$100,000 equivalent for firms and US$50,000 equivalent for&#13;
individuals. Supporting documentation for these expenditures would be retained by the&#13;
Land Bank of the Philippines and MWSS, made available to Bank supervision missions,&#13;
and regularly audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
2.49 To facilitate loan disbursement for the SSD component, the Land Bank of the&#13;
Philippines will open and maintain a separate special deposit account, in a commercial&#13;
bank specifically authorized for this purpose by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, on terms&#13;
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, including appropriate protection against set-off,&#13;
seizure and attachment. The Special Account, which would cover the Bank's share of&#13;
eligible expenditures in all disbursement categories, would have an authorized allocation&#13;
of US$2 million to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and deposited in the Special&#13;
Account; unless the Bank agrees otherwise, the authorized allocation shall be limited to&#13;
an amount equal to US$1 million until disbursements and outstanding commitments&#13;
against the loan equal or exceed US$25 million. Applications to replenish the Special&#13;
Account, supported by appropriate documentation, would be submitted regularly&#13;
(preferably monthly, but not less than quarterly) or when the amounts withdrawn equal&#13;
50% of the initial deposit. The Land Bank of the Philippines will have the project-related&#13;
records, accounts and financial statements audited by independent auditors acceptable to&#13;
the bank.&#13;
2.50 Project implementation would extend over five years, starting September 1997.&#13;
All major works would be substantially completed by December 31, 2002. The loan&#13;
would be closed on June 30, 2003. A disbursement schedule, as well as a profile of&#13;
disbursements under previous Bank-assisted water and sewerage projects, is shown in&#13;
Annex 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
3. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF SEWERAGE&#13;
INVESTMENTS&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
3.1   The financial analysis of the sewerage investments involved two important&#13;
elements: (a) a review of the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) as the primary borrower&#13;
and (b) the financial appraisal of the four sewerage sub-projects to be implemented by the&#13;
LGUs in conjunction with their water districts. The latter involved the design of an&#13;
innovative cost-sharing scheme whereby the four LGUs would absorb the capital costs&#13;
financed by sub-loans from LBP for their respective sewerage projects, while the water&#13;
districts would absorb the continuing operations and maintenance activities on the basis&#13;
of a management agreement or long-term concession. In addition, users would be&#13;
expected to pay for the direct cost of installations and reimburse the LGUs for this&#13;
component of the sewerage projects.&#13;
3.2   As such, responsibility for cost recovery will be shared between the LGUs, water&#13;
districts and users by: (a) spreading the capital costs through the entire community and&#13;
cost recovery through the LGUs' general property and business tax revenue base; (b)&#13;
applying a user tariff as a surcharge by the water districts to cover operating and&#13;
maintenance expenses; and (c) charging a one-time installation fee, payable in one or&#13;
more installments that would be applied to users who connect to the new system.&#13;
B. Land Bank of the Philippines&#13;
3.3   The Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) will be the primary borrower and will&#13;
on-lend the funds to the four sub-projects, which have already been separately appraised&#13;
and are summarized below. Funds will be on-lent on the basis of 20 years maturity, with&#13;
a 5-year grace period at an annual rate of interest of 14% per year. LBP will assume the&#13;
credit risk, while the Government of the Philippines will absorb the foreign exchange&#13;
risk. LBP will make its own credit appraisal and will administer and supervise the sub-&#13;
projects.&#13;
3.4   Through other projects, the Bank has had considerable involvement with the LBP,&#13;
the most recent being the Philippines Second Rural Finance Projects (Loans 3938-PH,&#13;
3939-PH and 3940-PH of 1996), and the Agrarian Reform Communities Development&#13;
Project (Loan 37079-PH) approved by the Board in November 1996. Therefore, the&#13;
financial appraisal of the Land Bank drew largely on work completed for the above&#13;
projects, except for minor revisions based on the latest update of organizational and&#13;
financial information provided by LBP. Land Bank's financial and institutional capacity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
as borrower was found to be satisfactory. Annex 4 summarizes LPB's current&#13;
organizational and financial status.&#13;
C. Financial Appraisal of the Subprojects&#13;
3.5   The finances and debt service capacity for each of the sub-projects were analyzed,&#13;
focusing on: (a) the capacity of each LGU to effectively service the debt assumed for its&#13;
sub-project, and; (b) the ability of the water districts to fully recover operating and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) costs through a sewerage surcharge on users' monthly water bills.&#13;
These analyses were supported by two long-term dynamic financial planning models&#13;
which projected financial operations for the participating LGUs and water districts.&#13;
Specifically, the analyses focused on the following aspects:&#13;
*  LGUs' overall capacity to raise and collect taxes, invest efficiently, operate the&#13;
proposed sanitation and sewerage infrastructure, and service the debt related to the&#13;
project loans from LBP, as well as other financial commitments.&#13;
*  water districts' ability to determine the amount and level of user surcharges&#13;
needed to sustain the O&amp;M expenses in the sewerage systems in their respective&#13;
districts.&#13;
X  households' ability and willingness to subscribe to and pay for sanitation and&#13;
sewerage services offered by the project.&#13;
D. LGU Finance&#13;
3.6   The Local Government Code of 1991 provides the framework for granting greater&#13;
administrative and financial autonomy to the state's territorial and political subdivisions&#13;
(the LGUs), and decentralizes (to these units) important functions previously handled at&#13;
the national level. The Code details all aspects relating to the financial management of&#13;
the LGUs, whether these are provinces, cities, municipalities, barangays, or special&#13;
economic zones. The LGUs can raise revenue through property taxes, business taxes and&#13;
licenses, commercial activities and other means. They also prepare annual budgets,&#13;
which include provisions for financing from various sources, including block transfers&#13;
from the Government and credit arrangements.&#13;
3.7   LGUs were created as corporate juridical entities with powers to govern their&#13;
economic enterprises, including: (a) raising revenue through taxes; (b) acquiring and&#13;
conveying real property; and (c) raising credit financing within specific limitations.&#13;
Various national agencies oversee these matters, including the Departments of Finance&#13;
and Interior, Bureau of Management and Budget, and the Commission on Audits.&#13;
3.8   In the past, LGUs obtained revenue mainly from internally generated sources such&#13;
as taxes, licenses, fees, commercial activities, and the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA)&#13;
from the national government. Debt financing, a third possible source of finance, has&#13;
been used sporadically, mostly by the larger city governments. The limits of debt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
financing have been partly self imposed by the local governments, and restricted by&#13;
specific ceilings set by the Code and the more traditional creditworthiness criteria.&#13;
However, in many respects, access to debt financing has also been restricted by the&#13;
LGUs' inability to fully assess their capacity to borrow for investments with longer&#13;
implementation horizons. This lack of long-term financial planning has not only delayed&#13;
progress in this area, but may have contributed to sub-optimal investment programs.&#13;
Further, unlike local governments in other developing countries, the LGUs have obtained&#13;
substantial finances through the national allotments, but have been reluctant to use or&#13;
leverage the funds, instead placing them in interest-bearing accounts.&#13;
3.9    The participating LGUs have received technical assistance and training from the&#13;
Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) and from the Bank to develop and&#13;
analyze long-term financial plans. This has helped them better assess their long-term&#13;
investment and operating requirements and debt servicing capacity related to the&#13;
proposed projects, as well as to other existing or future loans. The financial planning&#13;
exercise also enabled the LGUs to assess their operating performance, particularly with&#13;
regard to property and business tax levels, collections and operating efficiency. The&#13;
conclusions are reviewed in the following section.&#13;
E. Past Performance of the LGUs&#13;
3.10   Table 3.1 summarizes current financial operations and the overall condition of the&#13;
four LGUs. It suggests that there are potentials to leverage infrastructure investments,&#13;
although the current financial performances leave room for considerable improvements.&#13;

Coverage &#13;
3.11   All four LGUs have stayed fully within the budget guidelines prescribed by the&#13;
national Government. As shown in the table, only Cagayan de Oro anticipated a net&#13;
operating deficit for 1996 but still retained a positive operating cash-flow. Based on&#13;
estimated year-end 1996 results, all four are financially secure with excessively low debt&#13;
levels to total capitalization. This financial posture, combined with expected increases in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
their respective revenue bases, provides adequate assurance of the LGU's capacity to&#13;
service the project loans without necessarily projecting operating improvements.&#13;
3.12  The financial appraisal indicated that following the regular transfers of IRA funds&#13;
from the national to LGU levels, LGU administrations have considerable opportunities to&#13;
leverage financing to support infrastructure investments in their jurisdictions. During&#13;
project preparation, participating city governments were assisted in developing a financial&#13;
planning institutional capacity. For example, besides turning to internal sources and the&#13;
IRA contributions to obtain capital, few LGUs had explored options for financing cash&#13;
deficits, however temporary these may be. Forward planning has also been deficient and&#13;
is prompting many LGUs to hoard cash (in the deposit accounts noted above) and other&#13;
liquid assets in the event of unexpected shortfalls or contingencies. Thus, while their&#13;
financial conditions seem more than adequate to assume new debt (to finance sewerage&#13;
investments), they could strengthen their position even more. In many respects, the&#13;
LGU's conservative practices have delayed development, since they have not drawn on&#13;
their available funds to finance new community projects.&#13;
3.13  During appraisal of the sub-projects, it was also found that:&#13;
*  assessments of real properties, now 40%-54% of market values, could be&#13;
increased substantially according to the 1991 Local Government Code, so as&#13;
to boost revenues for each LGU;&#13;
*  LGUs could take more aggressive steps to reduce business tax evasion, which,&#13;
based on rough estimates made by the staff, produces only 20% compliance,&#13;
and&#13;
*  collections of assessed taxes are also estimated to be low, from 76%-82%,&#13;
although a policy exists that allows them to levy fines on delinquent accounts.&#13;
3.14 However, using the assistance provided during project preparation, LGU&#13;
administrators have viewed their performance with a new long-term, dynamic&#13;
perspective. While the proposed project only focuses on improving institutional capacity&#13;
to plan and supervise sewerage investments, LGUs are being offered Bank assistance&#13;
through other proposed projects that exclusively focus on strengthening their financial&#13;
management practices (by improving their accounting, budgeting and investment&#13;
planning techniques, as well as long-term financial planning).&#13;
F. Future LGU Performance&#13;
3.15 Annex 3 summarizes the assumptions used to project the financial performance of&#13;
the participating LGUs and assesses their capacity to service the debt assumed for&#13;
financing the sub-projects. Further, Table A3.1 outlines the financing plan for each sub-&#13;
project, showing sums financed by the proposed loan, internally generated LGU funds,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
and user installation charges. Each LGU is unique, drawing on loan financing to the&#13;
extent it is needed and affordable.&#13;
3.16 Table 3.2 below summarizes the LGUs' projected performance. The table covers&#13;
a number of important financial management parameters which clearly demonstrate the&#13;
ability of each LGU to undertake the proposed sewerage investments on financial&#13;
grounds.&#13;
3.17   This is primarily reflected in the four financial ratios presented in Table 3.2. 12&#13;
The current ratios reflect the LGUs' ability to adequately handle their short-term working&#13;
capital requirements. Cotabato and Davao project the lowest liquidity indicators. While&#13;
these are acceptable for Davao (at its lowest point of 2.09 times), Cotabato's Current&#13;
Ratio declines temporarily to 1.97 in 1999, which is marginally acceptable according to&#13;
generally accepted standards for commercial enterprises. In the context of municipal&#13;
finance, such working capital levels represented by the current ratio are well within an&#13;
acceptable range, due generally to high liquidity positions of LGUs and lower&#13;
requirements for work-in-process and finished inventories (commonly associated with&#13;
private manufacturing and commercial enterprises). Concerning debt to total&#13;
capitalization, Cotabato again shows the highest leveraged position, reaching 50% debt in&#13;
2000, which may be satisfactory when factoring in the other financial indicators,&#13;
particularly a debt service coverage ratio of 7.24 times in the same year. All other LGUs&#13;
project no greater than 40% debt in any one year and a satisfactory self-financing ratio.&#13;
The Land Bank, in its subsidiary loan agreements with LGUs, will require the latter to&#13;
maintain: (a) a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of not less than 1.5; (b) debt to&#13;
total capitalization ratio of not more than 0.75; (c) a ratio of internal cash generation to&#13;
debt service requirements of not less than 2.0, and (d) a ratio of internal cash generation&#13;
to capital expenditures of not more than 0.30. Such standards may require LGUs to&#13;
improve operating performance in the areas previously discussed.&#13;
12 While typically not applied in the analysis of Municipalities, the debt to total capitalization ratio is&#13;
relevant in the analysis of LGUs because many hold revenue generating assets (such as, markets, bus&#13;
termninals, municipal waste operations, slaughterhouses etc.) and other operations that could be&#13;
financed along commercial criteria or alternatively, be privatized.&#13;

G. Financial Implications for Participating Water Districts&#13;
3.18   As indicated, the projected finances for each participating water district were&#13;
analyzed so as to evaluate the long-term consequences of the O&amp;M functions on user&#13;
charges. Assumptions used for the financial projections are described in Annex 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
3.19 The analyses indicate that a surcharge of 30%-50% on the monthly water bills of&#13;
connected properties (such as large apartment and office buildings, hotels and some&#13;
households in upper-income areas) would more than adequately cover the O&amp;M of the&#13;
sewerage system for each city. This will result in an increase to the existing monthly&#13;
water bill from P98 to P116 (or roughly $3.5 equivalent) in the average monthly bill of&#13;
users, as shown in Table 3.3. The incremental costs were compared with estimates of&#13;
affordability and willingness to pay (generated during project preparation).'3 The&#13;
analyses also suggest that if the LGUs offered property owners long-term financing to&#13;
bridge the up-front investment costs of installing sewer connections, the impact on the&#13;
monthly water bill would be affordable to consumers in the project service areas.&#13;

H. Summary of Financial Implementation Arrangements&#13;
3.20 Liabilities to be assumed by LGUs. The four LGUs will through the subsidiary&#13;
loan agreements undertake to:&#13;
(a)   Assume liability for the Bank loan provided through the LBP and make&#13;
the required local funds available to LGU administrations;&#13;
(b)   Through a council resolution, require water users in the project service&#13;
area who consume above the average amount to connect to the sewerage&#13;
system;&#13;
(c)   Enter into a contract with the WDs to establish the conditions for&#13;
operating the systems (draft Memorandum of Agreement is in Annex 12);&#13;
(d)   Require households located within the sewerage service area, not&#13;
connected to the system, to empty their septic tanks every four years&#13;
3 Ability to pay is defined as I per cent of household incomes. In the project context, however, the ability&#13;
to pay of commercial establishments is more relevant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
3.21   Liabilities to be assumed by the water districts.'4 Each WD through its&#13;
memorandum of agreement with the relevant LGU undertake to:&#13;
(a)    Operate, maintain and recover costs of the completed sewerage&#13;
infrastructure;&#13;
(b)    Recover the costs of O&amp;M and the initial connections through sewerage&#13;
surcharges included in the water bill; and&#13;
(c)    Transfer the amounts collected for the sewer connections to the LGU to&#13;
amortize the loans.&#13;
14 An understanding with the Government is that once subprojects are completed, the concerned water&#13;
districts will be responsible for financing future sewer connections. This would create an incentive for&#13;
the water districts to encourage its customers to connect during project implementation itself&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
4. PROJECT IMPACT, BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
4.1   The project benefits are primarily through improved sanitation in participating&#13;
cities. The PPA component is a piloting exercise, but has the potential of sparking private&#13;
sector interest to enter into long-term contracts with Philippine water utilities. In turn,&#13;
these contracts could provide much needed additional investments, management expertise&#13;
and client-oriented services through which service delivery and coverage would improve.&#13;
4.2   As for sewerage, sanitation and drainage, about 300,000 persons are expected to&#13;
benefit from the SSD investments. The sewerage component will serve mainly the initial&#13;
service area of each city, which involves the relatively large consumers of piped water&#13;
supply (office buildings, hotels, etc.). While this number of beneficiaries is relatively&#13;
limited, investments are costly and progress will have to be incremental. On-site&#13;
sanitation and drainage investments will benefit the low income populations in these&#13;
cities.&#13;
4.3   For its part, the SSD component will help cities strategically plan and develop&#13;
sanitation and wastewater infrastructure that can be operated and maintained in a&#13;
sustainable manner. The anticipated sewerage investments should substantially enhance&#13;
the welfare of 20%-30% of the citizens in the four Philippine cities (Davao City, Cagayan&#13;
de Oro, Cotabato and Calamba). Later, they will expand the system to other parts of the&#13;
urban areas. Such investments increase the market value of property, which, in turn,&#13;
raises the revenue generated from property tax. In Calamba and Cotabato, several&#13;
ecologically fragile areas, such as wetlands, lake and estuarine areas, now polluted by&#13;
urban wastewater, will be protected. In all the four cities, the sewerage infrastructure will&#13;
reduce the pollution of low-lying residential (low income) areas downstream of the&#13;
respective Central Business Districts. Populations in these areas are currently most&#13;
vulnerable to diseases caused by untreated wastewater.&#13;
4.4   Investments in drainage and sanitation will benefit a much larger proportion of&#13;
low-income residents because they address the problems of low-lying areas and squatter&#13;
settlements. As a result, morbidity caused by gastro-intestinal disease, and medical&#13;
expenses and working days lost because of illness will decline substantially.&#13;
4.5   While most of these benefits to public health, household convenience and general&#13;
cleanliness of neighborhoods are well-known, they are not easily quantified. However,&#13;
estimates of health and recreational benefits were computed using conservative and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
optimistic valuation scenarios. Additional evidence on valuation of project benefits was&#13;
available from household willingness-to-pay surveys. A third source of evidence was the&#13;
potential increase in land values in the sewered areas, which will internalize many of the&#13;
private benefits from sewerage investments. Particularly important is the potential for&#13;
attracting investment in high-rise buildings such as hotels and offices. Evidence from&#13;
cities such as Manila and Jakarta suggests that when sewerage is installed in central&#13;
business districts, private investment in commercial properties rises substantially. If even&#13;
a modest fraction of such increases takes place in the project cities, the total increase in&#13;
property value will easily exceed the present discounted cost of the project (see Annex&#13;
10). In Davao city, for example, the social value of the project would exceed its costs if&#13;
CBD land values increased by only 5% (as compared with estimates as high as 20% for&#13;
Manila and Jakarta).&#13;
4.6   The project preparation team has also tried to assess how local communities value&#13;
the investments in sewerage, sanitation and drainage. The starting point in each city was&#13;
to survey residents to learn what types of sanitation services households wanted and how&#13;
much they were willing to pay. Next, the project verified preferences at the community&#13;
or "purok" (neighborhood) level in three barangays of Davao City to determine how they&#13;
viewed the potential benefits and costs from the project. Finally, mayors, city councilors&#13;
and LGU professional staff were consulted with respect to their priorities.&#13;
4.7   The surveys led to three conclusions. First, existing measurement techniques&#13;
considerably underestimate the environmental and health benefits of sewerage&#13;
investments because many of the relevant factors are difficult to quantify. At best,&#13;
quantitative analyses of benefits and costs and survey-based measures of willingness-to-&#13;
pay can only offer benchmarks for decisions that affect people's health and the quality of&#13;
their lives. Second, the city councils' acceptance of the project proposal points to the&#13;
groups' perception that the works will benefit their communities: The councils and&#13;
communities often identified the increased land values in sewered areas, the improved&#13;
neighborhood ambiance, the cities' attractiveness to investors and the protection offered&#13;
to deteriorating recreational amenities (beaches, lakes and wetlands) as significant&#13;
benefits. Third, the collaborative process of working out the final program of&#13;
investments further validates the communities' interest in these investments.&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
4.8   Facilitating private sector participation in the Philippines water sector requires a&#13;
streamlining of the existing framework of laws and administrative procedures. The key&#13;
changes in the legal and regulatory environment, therefore, require legislation by the&#13;
Philippine Congress. While a bill to create a National Water Regulatory Commission is&#13;
expected to be drafted within the next few months in 1997, its passage through the&#13;
Congress could be delayed beyond the elections. This delay could impede the successful&#13;
replication of PPA in water utilities outside the MWSS area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
4.9   Another potential risk could be community apathy toward utilizing the PPA&#13;
information effectively. However, the project incorporates an innovative feature that&#13;
could convert apathetic consumers and potential critics to active supporters of&#13;
privatization. The independent auditors responsible for monitoring and evaluating&#13;
whether the MWSS concessionaires are meeting their contractual targets will be&#13;
developing public reporting formats that can be easily understood by the public, media&#13;
and Congressional leaders. Armed with timely and reliable information, consumers,&#13;
community leaders and the media will be able to monitor the actual benefits of&#13;
privatization to the Metro Manila water and sanitation service consumers. Also, the&#13;
system will significantly increase transparency, thereby reducing the risk that corruption&#13;
will undermine the regulations.&#13;
4.10 A third risk involves the possibility that the next LGU administration (in 1998)&#13;
would want to change the loan covenants connected to the sewerage and sanitation&#13;
investments. For this reason, the project proposes that final engineering designs be&#13;
completed only after extensive consultations with the affected stakeholders in the cities&#13;
and neighborhoods. The use of participative planning methods is expected to ensure that&#13;
a broad consensus exists with respect to the project design and benefits, so that newly&#13;
elected Council members would have less incentive to question decisions taken by their&#13;
predecessors. Further, the project's monitoring and evaluation system will provide LGUs&#13;
with considerable freedom to adapt the sanitation infrastructure investments in future&#13;
years, so that the lessons learned are utilized to improve design in subsequent phases of&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
4.11  A fourth risk is potential implementation problems. Land acquisition by LGUs for&#13;
sewage treatment plant sites, for example, is required to be completed before detailed&#13;
engineering design is completed. Delays in completing the purchase of the land could put&#13;
at risk the proposed construction schedule. Second, delays in establishing fully&#13;
functioning Project Management Units (PMUs) in LGUs could jeopardize the project&#13;
planning and construction schedules. Third, a failure to adequately involve water districts&#13;
in the planning and implementation phases could reduce their incentive to implement the&#13;
proposed management contracts after the facilities have been completed. Finally, in this&#13;
pilot effort at implementing a demand-based sewerage project in the Philippines, the&#13;
quality of supervision provided by the Project Management Office (PMO) in the Land&#13;
Bank, along with the technical support provided by CPSO-LWUA will be critical.&#13;
Assurances were obtained during negotiations from the Land Bank and the Government&#13;
that the above risks would be adequately mitigated through the subsidiary loan&#13;
agreements between Land Bank and the participating LGUs, and through the working&#13;
arrangements with CPSO-LWUA.&#13;
C. Sustainability of Sewerage Investments&#13;
4.12 The financing responsibilities have been divided between the investment and&#13;
O&amp;M phases in order to ensure the sewerage investments can be sustained. In the&#13;
investment phase, LGUs will be the borrowers because they have the capacity to finance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
them through the IRA mechanism, as well as the ability to raise local revenues.&#13;
Moreover, the LGUs consist of democratically elected councilors who are accountable to&#13;
the local communities. In the O&amp;M stage, the water districts will be responsible. Since&#13;
the LGUs lack an enforcement mechanism to ensure that users pay for services and&#13;
technical expertise to operate and maintain the infrastructure efficiently, it was felt the&#13;
WDs have a comparative advantage: All have computerized billing and collection&#13;
systems, and staff trained to handle routine O&amp;M problems. Thus, the project design&#13;
relies on these bodies as a way to sustain the investments.&#13;
4.13  To assure sustainability, the proposed sewerage systems will finance their O&amp;M&#13;
costs through user charges levied on the monthly water bill. It is expected these charges&#13;
will be supported by consumers who are convinced the services will benefit them.&#13;
Collecting the charges will be facilitated if the sewerage fees are a line item in the&#13;
monthly water bill: since households that do not pay their bills would face the risk of&#13;
water being cut off. It is felt that this threat is sufficient to assure payment of the&#13;
sewerage surcharge and loan for property connections.&#13;
4.14  For sanitation and drainage investments, the sub-projects will vary substantially in&#13;
coverage, characteristics and costs, due to the different levels of income and living&#13;
standards in the various communities. As much as possible, sanitation cost recovery will&#13;
be the responsibility of private contractors. O&amp;M will be the responsibility either of&#13;
contractors or the entire community (say, for micro-drainage infrastructure and&#13;
community sewers).&#13;

pHRIIPPINES&#13;
WATER DISTRICTS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Project Description&#13;
I. The Public Performance Audit Component&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The public performance audit (PPA) component is a part of a broad-ranging set of&#13;
support being provided to the Government of Philippines by the World Bank. The&#13;
objective of this support is to help Philippine water utilities to draw on the private sector&#13;
both for capital to develop new works, and to achieve improvements in the efficiency of&#13;
their operations. Apart from MWSS, a growing number of the larger Water Districts, in&#13;
particular, have now reached a level of commercial viability that puts them in a position&#13;
to deal with the private sector, rather than relying on continuing concessional finance&#13;
from governmental sources. There is also increasing interest by experienced private&#13;
sector companies in participating in the water and sanitation sector investments in the&#13;
high-growth areas close to Metro Manila. The project preparation team has provided the&#13;
Government with technical assistance to create an environment more conducive to private&#13;
sector involvement, and to ensure that this involvement is to the benefit of consumers.&#13;
2.    Three key barriers have been identified to successful private sector involvement in&#13;
Water Districts and other water and sanitation utilities:&#13;
(a)   the lack of a well-targeted, consistent and transparent framework for the&#13;
economic regulation of water and sanitation utilities;&#13;
(b)   limited availability of infornation to local politicians and consumers, as&#13;
well as to potential private sector partners, on the relative performance of&#13;
water and sanitation utilities, and hence the scope for performance&#13;
improvements, and&#13;
(c)   limited capacity at the local level for developing proposals for private&#13;
sector participation, and for assessing the merits of unsolicited proposals&#13;
for private water and sanitation schemes.&#13;
A. Regulatory Framework&#13;
3.    The regulatory and institutional framework for the Philippines water sector is the&#13;
product of incremental developments over many years, each in response to the particular&#13;
challenges of the time. The result is a high degree of fragmentation, and laws and&#13;
regulations that reflect ad hoc responses to temporal problems. Multiple institutions hold&#13;
regulatory powers over the water and sanitation sectors. The jurisdictions of these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                        ANNEX 1&#13;
institutions are fragmented, overlapping and unclear. There is a profound lack of&#13;
transparency in the design and application of regulatory rules, and in mechanisms for&#13;
appeal of regulatory decisions. The implications of this lack of regulatory clarity and&#13;
consistency are three-fold:&#13;
a) a lack of clear signals to utilities about the parameters of acceptable performance;&#13;
b) the lack of a systematic approach to the protection of consumers from potential&#13;
monopolistic abuses by water and sanitation utilities; and&#13;
c) the perception of a high degree regulatory uncertainty by prospective private sector&#13;
investors in water and sanitation services, which acts as a potential disincentive to private&#13;
sector involvement.&#13;
4.    In the course of the preparation of the WDDP, work was undertaken, in&#13;
collaboration with the Asian Development Bank and USAID, to identify how best&#13;
current regulatory arrangements could be restructured, and the most appropriate design&#13;
and location of a new regulatory agency for water and sanitation utilities. The&#13;
recommendations were incorporated in the Report of the Joint Executive-Legislative&#13;
Water Crisis Commission to the President. Following this, on the request of GOP, a study&#13;
was completed to recommend the appropriate content of a national-level law on the&#13;
regulation of water and sanitation utilities.&#13;
5.    The Consultant's Report has now been accepted by GOP. The Report&#13;
recommends the form and structure of the proposed National Water Regulatory&#13;
Commission. It also provides detailed advice on the development of a new law for the&#13;
economic regulation of water utilities, encompassing both those utilities where there is a&#13;
degree of private sector participation and those remaining fully in the public sector. The&#13;
expectation is that a bill will be introduced by the Government in the Congress in 1997. to&#13;
establish a National Water Regulatory Commission. Technical Assistance in the form of&#13;
training will be provided, if the need arises. At this stage no separate cost estimates are&#13;
being prepared, as the likely expenditures can be financed from available technical&#13;
assistance grants.&#13;
B. Information Production and Dissemination (The PPA Component)&#13;
6.    The PPA Component will pre-fmance investments that will pilot and test the&#13;
establishment of a Public Performance Audit system for Manila's Water and Sanitation&#13;
Concession'. Based on the experience gathered from this pilot exercise, similar systems&#13;
are expected to be replicated in other water utilities of the country.&#13;
The note prepared by IFC for MWSS, MWSS Organization and Staffing . provides the detailed&#13;
recommendations on how the regulatory system will be organized in MWSS after privatization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39                        ANNEX 1&#13;
7.    The proposal is a result of a broad recognition that poor delivery of water and&#13;
sanitation services in Manila will not improve until provider incentives change.&#13;
Privatization of the MWSS can help by harnessing the profit motive as an incentive to&#13;
reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction. However, other performance-enhancing&#13;
measures are also likely to be necessary.&#13;
8.    Experience with regulatory reform in many countries has identified public&#13;
performance audit (PPA) as an important policy option. In PPA systems, independent&#13;
auditors monitor, evaluate and publicly report the performance of public utilities and&#13;
private firms whose activities strongly affect the public interest. For the Manila water&#13;
and sanitation concession, a PPA system will provide the following attractive features:&#13;
(a)   Regulation after privatization: The personnel of MWSS are poorly&#13;
equipped to monitor the performance of their successors. Consistent,&#13;
accurate and independent reporting of the concessionaire's performance&#13;
will greatly ease the burden of the regulator. The concession agreements&#13;
will be less prone to litigation if performance parameters are regularly&#13;
audited, and the regulator will find it easier to sanction the concessionaire&#13;
if shortfalls in service quality are clearly and publicly documented;&#13;
(b)   New performance incentives: Armed with timely and reliable&#13;
information, community leaders will find it much easier to monitor&#13;
concessionaire performance. Because PPA information is publicly&#13;
available, the news media will be important allies in this effort;&#13;
(c)   Potential for self-financing: Techniques for monitoring of water and&#13;
sanitation system performance are well-understood, and can be performed&#13;
under a standard service contract by many international auditing firms.&#13;
We estimate that a PPA system can be operated by a private auditing firm&#13;
for a monthly cost of less than two pesos per household, once setup costs&#13;
are amortized, and&#13;
(d)   Insurance against corruption: An auditing firm's financial survival is&#13;
tied to its national or international reputation for integrity, so there is little&#13;
risk that local corruption will undermine the system.&#13;
9.    The MWSS Board has approved the incorporation of a PPA system into the post-&#13;
privatization regulatory arrangements for the MWSS. Details on the PPA proposal&#13;
discussed at the Board are available in project files.&#13;
Who are the users of the PPA?&#13;
10.   The PPA system for Manila water and sanitation services will be designed to&#13;
satisfy the needs of several stakeholder groups:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40                        ANNEX 1&#13;
(a)   Consumers, the media and community leaders want a simple, credible&#13;
index of performance which they can use to judge service delivery;&#13;
(b)   Regulators need service quality measures to set appropriate incentives for&#13;
good performance;&#13;
(c)   Utility managers need similar information for efficient operation of the&#13;
system;&#13;
(d)   The environmental authorities need waste water quality measures to check&#13;
for compliance with regulations&#13;
What type of information will the PPA system provide?&#13;
11.   The PPA system will provide all of these stakeholders with appropriate, accurate&#13;
and timely information about the quality and cost of the services which consumers are&#13;
receiving. Reporting will cover three dimensions of service quality for end users in each&#13;
billing period:&#13;
(a)   Water Quality: Degree of chemical, physical and bacteriological&#13;
contamination&#13;
(i)    Chemical: Toxics, heavy metals&#13;
(ii)   Physical: Suspended solids, transparency&#13;
(iii) Bacteriological: Total coliforms, fecal coliforms&#13;
(b)   Reliability: Water availability as a percent of total time in the billing&#13;
period&#13;
(c)   Pressure: Open-tap flow pressure&#13;
12.   PPA reports in each billing period will be prepared for consumers in each district&#13;
or barangay. Service quality measures will cover all three dimensions (water quality,&#13;
reliability, pressure), while reports for waste water discharges need to cover only the&#13;
water quality measures. A system of PPA ratings will be developed, in consultation with&#13;
the Concessionaires and the MWSS Regulatory Office.&#13;
13.   Random sampling by the PPA contractor will be used to monitor self-reporting by&#13;
the concessionaire. Misreporting of a quality parameter can be defined as statistically&#13;
significant overestimation of quality. Misreporting for an area could result in automatic&#13;
assignment of an unsatisfactory status, for a specified period, to service quality for that&#13;
area. The key to PPA is benchmarking on accepted standards, with ratings assigned to&#13;
degrees of positive or negative deviations from the benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41                        ANNEX 1&#13;
Estimated Costs of establishing a PPA System&#13;
14.   The PPA system has to be based on sampling because it would be far too costly to&#13;
measure service quality for every consumer. Quality measurement has approximately&#13;
constant unit cost at each sampling point, so the operating cost of a PPA system will&#13;
grow proportionately with the product of areas represented, end user classes, service&#13;
quality dimensions, required sample sizes and the frequency of measurement.&#13;
15.   Sampling cost will be minimized by focusing on key fixed points in the&#13;
distribution system (e.g. pumping stations, large mains, waste water from treatment&#13;
facilities). The concessionaire will be expected to provide its own measures for each&#13;
billing period. The PPA contractor will randomly select and report measures for a sample&#13;
of the same points. In addition, both the concessionaire and the PPA contractor will&#13;
randomly samnple a significant group of households and businesses in each period to&#13;
establish comparable measures of end-user service quality. Most of the variation in&#13;
service quality will be accounted for by distribution-point measures, but end-user&#13;
sampling will permit checking for overall system integrity.&#13;
16.   Techniques for monitoring water and sanitation system performance are well-&#13;
understood, and can be perfonned under a standard service contract by many international&#13;
auditing firns. District- or barangay-level auditing services can be provided at low&#13;
incremental cost once an appropriate system has been developed and tested. With&#13;
approximately one million households in the Metro Manila Region, a PPA rating system&#13;
can be operated for no more than two pesos per household per month under normal&#13;
conditions. This will be recovered through water and sewerage tariffs. A summary of&#13;
estimated costs is provided in Table A 1.3. For the first three years of operation, an&#13;
annual cost of 56.7 million pesos is projected, which can be covered by grants and project&#13;
financing. The Pilot exercise supported by the Project will be for the first year only.&#13;
Based on the lessons learned through, terms of reference will be finalized to contract the&#13;
PPA system to independent, private auditors who are acceptable to the Government and&#13;
the two MWSS Concessionaires. By the end of the first year the transition from the pilot&#13;
exercise to a full-fledged PPA system is expected to have taken place.&#13;

17.   The project is financing the piloting of a PPA system in MWSS, with the&#13;
expectation that with the experience gathered, the Government would be in a position to&#13;
decide whether (i) other water utilities (Water Districts, Subic Water, LGU-run Water&#13;
Utilities) that are privatized be included in the PPA, and (ii) the audits should be extended&#13;
to water districts and LGU-managed water utilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43                        ANNEX I&#13;
II. SEWERAGE, SANITATION AND DRAINAGE COMPONENT&#13;
General&#13;
18.   The establishment of water districts has resulted in significant expansion of&#13;
investments in water supply services for secondary cities in the Philippines over the past&#13;
20 years. However, no comparable investments have been made in wastewater&#13;
infrastructure to cope with the increasing quantities of wastewater from domestic,&#13;
commercial and industrial sources. Only two secondary cities (Baguio and Vigan) have&#13;
some sewerage systems. Most households use inadequately designed septic tanks which&#13;
contribute to environmental pollution, and many industries discharge untreated wastes&#13;
into the urban environment. This trend, if allowed to continue, would pose a threat not&#13;
only to public health and the environment, but also to the emerging economic&#13;
development in the secondary cities.&#13;
19.   The sewerage, sanitation and drainage component of the Water Districts&#13;
Development Project (WDDP) is aimed at addressing these problems. It seeks to do so by&#13;
increasing access of communities to sustainable sewerage and sanitation facilities,&#13;
thereby reducing public health risks, and reducing environmental pollution from&#13;
wastewater sources. The project is designed not only to expand access to improved&#13;
services, but also to pilot a learning experience for the expansion of sustainable sanitation&#13;
services to such secondary cities. Accordingly, project cities have been chosen to&#13;
represent a cross-section of urban sanitation issues likely to be encountered in secondary&#13;
cities. The project cities are thus: Cagayan de Oro, Calamba, Cotabato, and Davao City.&#13;
20.  Investment choices in the project are driven by demand; and the choice of the&#13;
degree to which wastewater is to be treated is driven by considerations of cost&#13;
effectiveness and environmental sustainability. This approach is based on (i) the 1994&#13;
NEDA Board Resolution No. 5, which calls for a demand-based approach in making&#13;
choices in urban sanitation investments: and on (ii) the 1991 Local Government Code&#13;
devolving much of municipal responsibility to the local government unit (LGU) level.&#13;
These investments are operationalizing the recommendations of the National Sewerage&#13;
and Sanitation Sector Strategy Study which, inter alia, call for a demand-based approach&#13;
in making urban sanitation investments in secondary cities in the Philippines.&#13;
Sub-Components&#13;
21.   This project component will include the following sub-components: (i) on-site&#13;
and communal sanitation facilities; (ii) sewerage systems; (iii) maintenance equipment,&#13;
tools and spare parts for the operation and maintenance of installed sewerage&#13;
infrastructures; (iv) institutional support; and (v) drainage facilities in Cotabato City.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44                        ANNEX I&#13;
On-Site and Communal Facilities&#13;
22.   On-site sanitation facilities will be provided for individual dwellings and for&#13;
communal uses. Individual dwelling sanitation facilities will include VIP latrines and&#13;
pour flush toilets. They will be supplied, in response to demand, to both rented dwellings&#13;
and owner occupied houses. Communal sanitation facilities to be provided under the&#13;
project may be either on-site or off-site, connected to the sewerage system, depending on&#13;
technical feasibility. The choice between communal and individual sanitation facilities&#13;
will be driven by technical feasibility and demand by key stakeholders, and not by tenure&#13;
status. However, in slum areas and squatter settlements, the demand will be ascertained&#13;
not only from the tenants, but also from land owners and from local government officials&#13;
representing the public interest.&#13;
23.  Individual dwelling sanitation facilities will be owned by households, but they&#13;
will be financed through the project. Households will be required to make their own&#13;
arrangements for construction, using small scale contractors who would be paid by the&#13;
PMUs upon satisfactory completion of the works.&#13;
24.   Ownership of the communal sanitation facilities will rest with the LGUs. They&#13;
will be constructed through local competitive bidding under the supervision of the PMUs.&#13;
Operation and maintenance will be undertaken by private operators on three-year lease&#13;
arrangements for an agreed monthly fee payable to the LGUs. The private operators could&#13;
be individual business people, cooperatives, or registered community-based&#13;
organizations. Arrangements and rules for the use of the communal sanitation facilities&#13;
will as agreed during user consultations and revised from time to time. Options of&#13;
arrangements to be discussed would include payment of an agreed fee per use, and access&#13;
to toilet rolls, soap, and water for ablution. Consideration may also be given to an&#13;
exemption fromi payment of senior citizens and children below a specified age.&#13;
Sewerage Systems&#13;
25.   The sewerage systems will include: (i) house connections; (ii) feeder sewers for&#13;
the collection of wastewater in neighborhoods, puroks and barangays; (iii) trunk sewers&#13;
and pumping systems for wastewater conveyance from barangays to treatment plants; and&#13;
(iv) sewage and septage treatment plants.&#13;
26.   The four sewerage systems will cover a total service area of 1,278 ha. whose&#13;
combined population, at the end of the construction period (2001-2002) will be about&#13;
260,050 of which 156,550 (or 60%) will be served through the construction of 28,232&#13;
connections. In the year 2015, the population in the service areas is projected to increase&#13;
to about 316,760 of which a total of about 197,960 residents will be served through&#13;
35,722 connections. The initial 28,232 connections will be included in the construction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45                        ANNEX 1&#13;
of the systems while the additional 7,490 connections will be constructed, from 2001-&#13;
2002 to 2015, by the concerned Water Districts (WDs).&#13;
27.   The connection of properties to sewers will be made under the project in order to&#13;
ensure good workmanship and timely connection of households to installed sewer&#13;
systems. Recovery of house connection costs will be spread over a period consistent with&#13;
demand. Feeder sewers will consist of simplified and condominial sewers. Where&#13;
condominial sewers are used, communities will be given a choice between location of the&#13;
sewers in backyards and locating them in front of their properties. Simplified sewers will&#13;
be used for trunk and main transportation sewers.&#13;
28.   A modified lagoon system will be used for the treatment of both sewage and&#13;
septage. Its principal unit is a deep vertically integrated pond with an anaerobic pond&#13;
below a facultative pond system. The geometry prevents turnovers, thereby minimizing&#13;
odor problems as well as sludge accumulation.&#13;
Mainn nce E     ent and Spares&#13;
29.   The sewerage systems will, after construction, be turned over to the WDs for&#13;
operation as well as construction of additional connections. Equipment will be provided&#13;
to the WDs including vehicles, machinery and tools needed for proper operation and&#13;
maintenance of the sewerage and pumping facilities. Spare parts for critical equipment&#13;
will also be supplied.&#13;
30.   The cost of new connections will be paid up-front by the users at the moment they&#13;
request the connection. This would constitute a constraint and will restrain the users from&#13;
being connected. To minimize this problem in the first one to two years of WDs&#13;
operation, it is proposed to include in the project the procurement of stored material&#13;
(pipes, fittings, etc.) necessary for the connections. This would reduce the up-front&#13;
amount required from the users since the material could be charged by the WDs on the&#13;
monthly water bills.&#13;
Institutional Su=ort&#13;
31.   The project will include: (i) consulting services to carry out the beneficiaries&#13;
participation process, detailed engineering design, and construction supervision; and (ii)&#13;
training of WDs' staff responsible for the operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of installed&#13;
sewerage infrastructures.&#13;
32.   The consulting services to be provided by the Project Consultant include&#13;
implementation supervision and the training of staff in charge of the O&amp;M of the&#13;
sewerage systems and particularly of modified pond systems. The Consultant will have&#13;
to prepare an O&amp;M manual for each city, train operators in the basics of pond treatment&#13;
of sewage and septage, and help them to become familiar with the O&amp;M manual. The&#13;
training program may include an overseas visit to a country where the adopted treatment&#13;
method is already in operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46                        ANNEX 1&#13;
33.   Technical assistance will be provided, as appropriate, to government agencies&#13;
(such as the Land Bank, LWUA, and LGUs) involved in project implementation. This&#13;
will include capacity building for project monitoring and evaluation so that lessons&#13;
learned could be fed back to improve future performance.&#13;
Sub-Project Selection in Cities&#13;
34.   The selection of sub-projects in participating cities will be based on assessment of&#13;
demand at three levels -- LGU, barangay, and household levels. The choice of priority&#13;
areas for sub-project investments within cities, and the decision on the magnitude of&#13;
investments will be made by LGU councils, using as a basis the results of economic cost-&#13;
benefit analysis and long-term financial projections of city revenues and expenditures.&#13;
User consultations at neighborhood or purok levels will be the instrument for deciding&#13;
whether qualified barangays would participate in the project, and also for choosing&#13;
between options of technologies to be used in barangays. Where appropriate, household&#13;
level surveys will be conducted for a rapid appraisal of demand prior to the user&#13;
consultations.&#13;
Davao City&#13;
35.   The project will construct on-site sanitation and sewerage facilities in the&#13;
Poblacion area and only sewerage facilities in the Toril area of Davao City. The&#13;
sanitation component will only include the construction of 140 communal toilets which&#13;
will benefit about 35,000 residents in the Poblacion area.&#13;
36.   The Poblacion service area was chosen, for the sewerage component, to reduce&#13;
beach pollution and the degradation of environmental conditions within the city. The&#13;
Stage I sewerage scheme will have a service area of 486 ha. with a population in 2015 of&#13;
147,300 of which 88,400 (or 60%) will be served through an estimated 16,370&#13;
connections. The Stage I system proposes the construction of a sewer network that will&#13;
discharge sewage to a single vertically integrated pond system designed to treat both&#13;
sewage and septage. The treatment plant located at a site near Davao River is the least&#13;
cost alternative and, if adopted, the treated effluent will be discharged to the Davao River.&#13;
37.   The inclusion of the Toril area, in the sewerage component of Davao project, was&#13;
based on projected environmental benefits to residents and on the protection of the&#13;
aquifer which is the source of domestic water supply for the Davao City Water District.&#13;
Only sewerage is envisaged in Toril. The Stage I sewerage scheme will have a service&#13;
area of 215 ha. with a population in 2015 of 19,700 all of which (or 100%) will be served&#13;
through an estimated 3,642 connections. The area is bounded on the north and west by&#13;
the Lipadas River, on the east by Barangays Lubogan and Talomo, and on the south by&#13;
the Davao Gulf. The Stage I system will include a sewer network system discharging&#13;
sewage to a single vertically integrated pond system designed to treat sewage and limited&#13;
quantities of septage. The treatment plant will be located in Daliao south of Toril. It will&#13;
discharge its treated effluent into the Davao Gulf.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47                        ANNEX 1&#13;
38.   The two sewerage schemes will benefit a total of about 108,100 residents with a&#13;
total of 20,012 connections.&#13;
Cagayan de Oro City&#13;
39.   The project will construct sewerage and sanitation facilities in Cagayan de Oro&#13;
City to reduce the recently confirmed sewerage and fecal contamination in the Cagayan&#13;
River and at various beaches. For the sanitation component, there will be a City-wide&#13;
construction of 6,882 on-site facilities for individual households and 36 communal toilets&#13;
over a five-year period. The on-site facilities will be made available depending on&#13;
technical feasibility and demand. The communal toilets will probably be constructed in&#13;
low-income areas. However, the facilities will only be constructed where, through public&#13;
consultation, there is an established demand and willingness-to-pay. The on-site facilities&#13;
are expected to benefit 50,300 residents while the communal toilets are expected to&#13;
benefit about 9,000 low-income residents.&#13;
40.   The Stage I sewerage scheme will have a service area of 192 ha. with a population&#13;
in 2015 of 34,270 of which 20,570 (or 60%) will be served through an estimated 3,422&#13;
connections. The Stage I system will serve the area bounded in the north and west by the&#13;
Cagayan de Oro River, on the east by the J. Pacana Street and on the south by Barangay&#13;
Macasanding. The sewer network will discharge to an integrated pond system designed&#13;
to treat both sewage and septage. The treatment plant is proposed to be located in&#13;
Barangay Consolacion, at a site near the Cagayan River where the treated effluent will be&#13;
discharged.&#13;
Calamba&#13;
41.  In Calamba, the project will construct 395 VIP latrines and 395 pour-flush toilet&#13;
with septic tanks, as well as 17 communal toilets over a five-year period. The on-site&#13;
facilities will be made available to individual households depending on technical&#13;
feasibility and demand. The communal toilets will probably be constructed in low-&#13;
income areas. However, the facilities will only be constructed where, through public&#13;
consultation, there is an established demand and willingness-to-pay. The on-site facilities&#13;
are estimated to benefit 4,150 residents while the communal toilets will benefit 4,250&#13;
low-income residents.&#13;
42.   The Stage I sewerage scheme will have a service area of 102 ha. with a population&#13;
in 2015 of 26,770 of which 16,060 (or 60%) will be served through an estimated 2,782&#13;
connections. The Stage I system proposes the construction of a sewer network in the&#13;
Poblacion area bounded by Barangay Banadero on the north, Barangays San Juan and&#13;
San Jose on the east, Barangay Lecheria on the south and Barangay Parian on the west.&#13;
The sewer network will discharge sewage to an integrated pond system designed to treat&#13;
both sewage and septage. The treatment plant is proposed to be located in Barangay&#13;
Banadero, at a site near San Cristobal River which will receive the treated effluent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48                       ANNEX 1&#13;
Cotabato Ci&#13;
43.  In Cotabato City, the Project will construct sanitation, sewerage and drainage&#13;
facilities. For the sanitation component there will be city-wide construction of 2,200 VIP&#13;
latrines and 734 pour-flush toilets with septic tanks, as well as 33 communal toilets over a&#13;
five-year period. The on-site facilities will be made available to individual households&#13;
depending on technical feasibility and demand. The communal toilets would be&#13;
constructed in low-income areas. However, the facilities will only be constructed where,&#13;
through public consultation, there is an established demand and willingness-to-pay. The&#13;
on-site facilities are estimated to benefit 16,400 residents while the communal toilets will&#13;
benefit 8,250 low-income residents.&#13;
44.   The Stage I sewerage scheme will have a service area of 283 ha. with a population&#13;
in 2015 of 88,720 of which 53,230 (or 60%) will be served through an estimated 9,506&#13;
connections. The Stage I system proposes the construction of a sewer network within the&#13;
area bounded by the Rio Grande de Mindanao on the north, Matampay River on the east,&#13;
Rosary Heights Barangays on the south and Barangay Baguan on the west. The sewer&#13;
network will discharge sewage to an integrated pond system designed to treat both&#13;
sewage and septage. The treatment plant is proposed to be constructed at Barangay&#13;
Poblacion 1, an area near the Rio Grande de Mindanao which will receive the treated&#13;
effluent.&#13;
45.   The drainage component has been included in the project following a specific&#13;
request by the LGU. A lump sum of P52 million has been allowed in the project cost for&#13;
the construction of drainage facilities deemed to be of high priority by the City&#13;
Government.&#13;
Project Management and Institutional Support&#13;
46.   A decentralized implementation arrangement is envisaged. There will be two&#13;
separate contracts for consulting services to prepare the detailed design of the project and&#13;
to supervise supply and construction contractors. There will be one such consultancy for&#13;
Davao and Cotabato Cities, and another for Cagayan de Oro, and Calamba. There will be&#13;
four separate supply and installation contracts, one for each city. Supply and construction&#13;
contractors will be supervised by consultants who designed the works under construction.&#13;
47.   LGUs, as borrowers, will assume full responsibility at the local level. Thus&#13;
consultants will be accountable to LGUs both for the design and for the supervision of&#13;
contractors in the LGUs concerned.&#13;
48.   Technical assistance for construction supervision will be provided by the CPSO in&#13;
LWUA which will also coordinate other forms of technical assistance under the project,&#13;
undertake monitoring and evaluation of project activities, and bring global experience to&#13;
bear on the design and construction phases. For these services, LWUA will be paid a&#13;
fixed fee (see Annex 8).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49                       ANNEX 1&#13;
49.  In addition to its role as the funding channel for the project, the LBP will assume&#13;
responsibility for overall national level coordination, monitoring, and supervision.&#13;
Operation and Maintenance&#13;
50.   There will be a decentralized approach to operation and maintenance. Water&#13;
districts in project cities will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the&#13;
sewerage systems. This would include the sewer networks, pumping stations, and&#13;
treatment works. Operation and maintenance of on-site sanitation systems will be the&#13;
responsibility of the households they serve. The options for operation and maintenance of&#13;
communal sanitation facilities will include management by: (a) Water Districts, (b) small&#13;
private contractors, and (c) user groups in barangays. The choice between these options,&#13;
along with methods for cost recovery or paying for operation and maintenance will be&#13;
negotiated during the user consultation process.&#13;

Public Performance Audit Component&#13;
1.    The estimated costs of establishing the Public Performance Audit (PPA) is&#13;
US$2.5 Million, of which approximately $2.3 million will be financed in the first year of&#13;
project implementation. The cost will be incurred to hire consulting services to help the&#13;
MWSS Chief Regulator (a) test and operationalize a PPA system, (b) finalize a terms of&#13;
reference and bid out out the PPA to independent auditors by the end of the year. MWSS&#13;
will provide counterpart funding of about $0.2 million.&#13;

I.    The financing requirements of the project are US$78.26 million; of which&#13;
US$67.76 is required for the investment program, and US$10.5 million is required for the&#13;
capitalized interest. The source of funds to finance these investnents is the loan from  the&#13;
World Bank, which will be routed through the Land Bank of Philippines, internal sources&#13;
from participating LGUs, and user installation charges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58                        ANNEX 3&#13;
II. Affordability Analysis for the Participating LGUs and Water Districts&#13;
A. Financing Rationale for Sewerage Development Projects&#13;
2.    The proposed sewerage component will be financed under an innovative cost-&#13;
sharing scheme whereby the four participating City and Municipal Governments (LGUs)&#13;
of Davao, Calamba, Cotabato and Cagayan de Oro will absorb the capital costs of their&#13;
respective sewerage projects, while the water districts will be responsible for continuing&#13;
the operations and maintenance of the system on the basis of a long-term concession.&#13;
Capital and operating cost recovery responsibility will be similarly shared between the&#13;
LGU and the water district as follows: (i) capital cost of the project will be spread&#13;
throughout the entire community of each LGU and recovered through the general&#13;
property and business tax revenues; and (ii) ongoing maintenance and operating expenses&#13;
for the sewerage services will be recovered through affordable user tariffs by the water&#13;
districts to users in order to cover their ongoing operating and maintenance expenses.&#13;
3.    This cost-sharing financing feature can be justified on several grounds. On the&#13;
one hand, the projects pose significant environmental and health benefits to each of their&#13;
respective urban populations, thus justifying LGU support to tackle a city-wide&#13;
externality problem. On the other hand, the entire financial burden of installing sewerage&#13;
infrastructure cannot be absorbed solely by LGUs since users will also privately benefit&#13;
by the improved service. However, the demand for the new system by the users may not&#13;
be particularly high, given that comparable services, albeit inferior environmentally and&#13;
from a health point of view, are already available to households. Thus, any attempt to&#13;
force users of the new system to shoulder the entire cost of the system would likely result&#13;
in few actually connecting to the new service, unless otherwise imposed through city&#13;
ordinances. Hence the cost sharing scheme allows for the costs to be allocated in an&#13;
equitable manner in relation to the derived benefits, thus making it also affordable for the&#13;
individual users to hook up to the new system.&#13;
B. ANALYTiCAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
4.    The cost-sharing nature of the financing scheme, requires an analytical framework&#13;
which could assess the institutional capacity and financial feasibility at both the LGU and&#13;
water district levels, even though only one loan would actually be made to each&#13;
participating LGU. At the LGU level, the analysis focused on the city's ability to meet&#13;
the debt service obligations related to the capital costs of the project which will be on-lent&#13;
through the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP). Analysis at the water district level&#13;
focused on deriving a user tariff which would be able to fully recover the operating and&#13;
maintenance expenses once the sewerage activities are operationalized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59                          ANNEX 3&#13;
5.    In supporting this analyses, two fully integrated financial models were developed&#13;
to project operating activity of both the participating LGUs and the water districts. I&#13;
Essentially, the elements of the projects were incorporated in the current an ongoing&#13;
financial parameters of each entity in order to assess the related financial implications of&#13;
the proposed projects. Each financial model accepts as inputs, basic assumptions on&#13;
revenues, operating expenses, new investment and ongoing capital expenditures, financial&#13;
management and current operating performance efficiency, in addition to other&#13;
assumptions on financing and amortization of existing loans.&#13;
6.    The financial models were programmed to simulate the activity of: (i) a city&#13;
administration where most revenues are sourced from national contributions and from&#13;
own sources, primarily property and business tax revenues; and (ii) a water district which&#13;
focuses essentially on water supply and distribution and sewerage services to its customer&#13;
base. Financial activity was projected according to acceptable financial management and&#13;
accounting principles. As such, the total funds available through internal and external&#13;
financing sources are allocated based on specific priorities as would typically be done by&#13;
the chief financial officer of the enterprise or city government. Requirements for working&#13;
capital, obligations to fund any trust liabilities and debt service are fulfilled first in order&#13;
to finance ongoing operations of either the LGU or the water district. Secondly, new&#13;
investment requirements are satisfied, first from the remaining internally generated funds&#13;
and then estimated secured debt and new equity financing. Specifically, external sources&#13;
of funds, including both borrowings and equity contributions are drawn as independent&#13;
variables in order to bridge whatever financing gap may result between the estimated&#13;
capital expenditures and remaining cash available after debt service and working capital&#13;
obligations. As such, the models do not draw excess funds except what is absolutely&#13;
desired to meet the needs of the project while still maintaining adequate levels for&#13;
working capital.&#13;
7.    Annual cash surpluses are initially reinvested in short term securities or time&#13;
deposits earning a minimal rate of return. Cash deficits that may result in any given year&#13;
during the projected period, would be financed, first by the sale of short-term securities or&#13;
other current assets while still maintaining an appropriate level of current assets to meet&#13;
ongoing working capital requirements. Debt financing is not considered an option for&#13;
meeting shortfalls in cash during the latter years of the projection period. Therefore, new&#13;
equity contributions are regarded as the only source of financing year-end shortfalls of&#13;
cash. However, since these additional equity contributions may not necessarily be&#13;
identified or assumed at the outset of this assessment, other assumptions, such as scaling&#13;
down or extending the program are revised first in order to derive a workable financing&#13;
solution. If, on the other hand, there is no way to achieve this and still retain the integrity&#13;
of the proposed project, it would be necessary to assume contributions of additional&#13;
IModel details are available in project files&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60                        ANNEX 3&#13;
equity to be agreed with the project sponsor. If this cannot be accomplished&#13;
satisfactorily, while maintaining a healthy financial position, major revisions in the&#13;
program would need to be considered.&#13;
C. THE LGU FINANCIAL PROJECTION MODEL&#13;
Significant Accounting Principles&#13;
8.    The LGU financial model corrects some major accounting deficiencies which&#13;
have a tendency to misrepresent the interpretation and accuracy of the projected financial&#13;
statements. These include:&#13;
(a)   Accrual Accounting. Currently, LGUs apply a mix of both accrual and&#13;
cash accounting and derive an operating cash statement which somewhat&#13;
resembles a cashflow statement. The model projects all accounts on an&#13;
accrual basis for consistency, which are then reflected in the three primary&#13;
statements namely, the Income, Balance Sheet and Flow of Funds&#13;
statements. In addition, the traditional operating cash statement is also&#13;
produced to present financial information in the reporting format that is&#13;
currently understood by the LGUs.&#13;
(b)   Property Taxes and Fines Receivable. LGUs do not account for&#13;
outstanding taxes. This has been corrected in the financial statements to&#13;
reflect outstanding amounts owed and to calculate the related fines on&#13;
amounts not paid.&#13;
(c)   IRA Contributions. Contributions from the National Government to the&#13;
LGU are treated as regular income and reflected in the operating cash&#13;
statement despite the fact that 20% of such receipts are restricted to the&#13;
Community Development Fund for new investment projects. In order to&#13;
better reflect these financial allocations, the accounting has been modified&#13;
to treat only 80% of national contribution as income, while treating the&#13;
remaining 20% as contributions to the capital account which are then&#13;
directly reflected in the flow of funds rather than the income statement.&#13;
This treatment allows for a better interpretation of the operating efficiency&#13;
of the LGUs, particularly with respect to the financial and liquidity&#13;
indicators.&#13;
(d)   Deprciation. LGUs presently do not record or depreciate fixed assets as&#13;
would be prescribed under generally accepted accounting practices for&#13;
commercial type enterprises. Indeed, many assets of LGUs are not&#13;
revenue generating and do not produce a meaningful relationship to&#13;
operating and financial efficiency. In addition, LGUs do not pay taxes,&#13;
and as such do not need to depreciate expenses to offset a tax liability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61                        ANNEX 3&#13;
However, it is still worthwhile to account for and depreciate fixed assets in&#13;
order to better reflect an LGU's ability to replace its fixed assets base from&#13;
its own operating cash flow. Moreover, LGUs, will be more attracted to&#13;
recording fixed assets that can be securitized (such as buildings and&#13;
privatizable business enterprises), as a part of the process of enhancing&#13;
their own ability to secure external financing in accordance with the Local&#13;
Government Code of 1991. For these reasons, all new assets placed in&#13;
service during the construction period were booked in the projected&#13;
accounts and depreciated according to an average expected useful life.&#13;
(e)   Construction Period. Construction is accounted as work-in-progress until&#13;
completed and made operational. During this period, interest charges are&#13;
capitalized and amortized over a period of time. As indicated, once placed&#13;
in service, fLxed assets are then depreciated. In addition, operating and&#13;
other expenses incurred during the project period are considered part of the&#13;
project cost and are also amortized during a specified period during the&#13;
projection period. Once operational status is achieved, the fixed assets,&#13;
capitalized interest and pre-operating expenses are amortized over a&#13;
specified period based on the life of the project.&#13;
Assumptions to the Financial Projections&#13;
General Projection Parameters&#13;
-  Projection Period. For projection purposes the total project period is&#13;
thirteen years, starting 1996 as the first projection year.&#13;
-  Currency. Pesos in thousand units.&#13;
-  Exchange Rate. An exchange rate of 26.27 Pesos to US$ 1.00 was&#13;
utilized.&#13;
-  Price and Cost Escalation Rates. Projections of both revenue and&#13;
expense items were made in current terms based on projected inflation&#13;
rates for both local and foreign currency costs.&#13;
-  Income Taxes. LGUs pay no income taxes.&#13;
-  Depreciation. For projection purposes, fixed assets are depreciated&#13;
based on a schedule of 25 years once it is placed in service.&#13;
Revenues&#13;
9.    Apart form the contributions from the National Government, LGUs have a wide&#13;
source of own-generated revenue, arising mostly from property taxes, business taxes,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62                         ANNEX 3&#13;
licenses and fees, penalties, as well as from business ventures such as, rental of space at&#13;
the local market, bus terminal fees, slaughterhouse fees, etc. Tax revenues as well as&#13;
most other funds that are self generated by LGUs, are largely driven by demographic data&#13;
on population, households and dwelling units as well as the projected number of&#13;
commercial and industrial business establishments. Trend projections were made for&#13;
each participating LGU in order to project tax and other revenues. The following&#13;
describes revenue assumption for the major revenue accounts.&#13;
(a)   Property Taxes. Property taxes and other major taxes are imposed by&#13;
LGUs in accordance with the Local Government Code of 1991, RA 7160&#13;
and the Philippine Constitution. Property taxes are levied according to a&#13;
variety of property classifications on both land and structures. Assessment&#13;
and tax rates as such vary by each type of property. The actual tax rate is&#13;
normally 1% to 2% percent of the assessed value.&#13;
(b)   Business Taxes. Business taxes are levied against reported total gross&#13;
receipts (or sales) of a given business and vary by size and type of&#13;
business. For projection purposes an average tax rate of .05% was&#13;
assumed.&#13;
(c)   Other Taxes and Fines. LGUs levy a number of other taxes on&#13;
miscellaneous activities and services including transfer taxes, amusement&#13;
taxes, building permits and subdivisions and other miscellaneous licenses&#13;
and fees. In addition, LGUs levy fines for uncollected property taxes at&#13;
12% per annum.&#13;
(d)   Revenues From Business Services Revenues from markets,&#13;
slaughterhouses, bus terminals, utilities and other business operated by the&#13;
LGU were projected based on historical parameters for each service&#13;
against projected growth in population.&#13;
(e)   Non-Operating Revenue. LGU non-operating revenue consists primarily&#13;
of 80% of national IRA contributions which are treated as income, and&#13;
interest on short-term deposits.&#13;
Operating Expenses&#13;
10.   Operating cost assumptions were made based on historical costs for major&#13;
expense categories currently utilized by each LGU including, salaries, travel and&#13;
communications, repair and maintenance, fuel, oil, supplies and materials, business&#13;
enterprise expenses, social security, insurance, and other expenses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
63                        ANNEX 3&#13;
Sources of Financing&#13;
11.   Bank funds would be on-lent by the Land Bank of Philippines to the LGUs based&#13;
on the strength of their respective financial condition by considering both the projected&#13;
IRA contributions as well internal revenue sources. Loans will be made available on&#13;
terms of 20-years maturity, a 5-year grace period and a fixed interest rate of 14% per&#13;
annum.&#13;
D. THE WATER DISTRICT FINANCIAL PROJECTION MODEL&#13;
Significant Accounting Principlh&#13;
12.   The water districts follow conventional accounting principles and standards&#13;
similar to other commercial utilities. However, the following accounting practice is&#13;
worth noting which was incorporated in the design of the financial projection model.&#13;
13.   Seuitv Dpoosit±. Like most utilities, it is assumed that the water districts will&#13;
receive advance deposits from customers as security against unpaid monthly water bills.&#13;
Such advances create a liability for the utility. A corresponding trust account is set to&#13;
hold a portion of this liability. However, it is presumed that the water district may at their&#13;
option, have access to these funds for their own internal use in case of cash shortfalls, and&#13;
therefore would not necessarily hold in trust the full amount of advances.&#13;
Assumptions to the Financial Projections&#13;
General Projection Parameters&#13;
-  Projection Period. For projection purposes the total project period is&#13;
thirteen years, starting 1996 as the first projection year.&#13;
-  Currency. Pesos in thousand units.&#13;
-  Exchange Rate. An exchange rate of 26.27 Pesos to US$ 1.00 was&#13;
utilized.&#13;
- Price and Cost Escalation Rates. Projections of both revenue and&#13;
expense items were made in current terms.&#13;
-  Income Taxes. Water districts are exempt from income taxes for&#13;
1996. However, starting with 1997 a levy of 35% will be applied on&#13;
income.&#13;
- Depreciation. For projection purposes, fixed assets are depreciated&#13;
based on a schedule of 25 years once they are placed in service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64                         ANNEX3&#13;
Revenues&#13;
14.   Water districts have traditionally realized revenues purely from water sales based&#13;
on usage, commodity charges as well as meter rentals. In addition, water districts also&#13;
receive other revenues through installation charges, penalties and fines as well as interest&#13;
earned on short-term deposits. In order to assess the viability of the sewerage project, a&#13;
sewerage surcharge has been added to the revenue base. Summarized below are the&#13;
important assumptions used for projecting revenues of the participating water districts.&#13;
a)    Water Production Capacity. Existing surface and groundwater capacity is&#13;
based on cubic meters of accessible water production after conducting an&#13;
inventory of the number of productive wells of surface water area.&#13;
b)    Service Connection Program. Since most water districts currently cover&#13;
a very small percentage of the total population, limitation to water supply&#13;
and distribution were based solely on the technical water production&#13;
capacity as well as the ability of the water district to actually connect new&#13;
customers. As such, a 5-year connection program formed the foundation&#13;
for driving water sales projections.&#13;
c)    Water Losses. Water losses were divided into two categories: (i) technical&#13;
losses arising through seepage during distribution; and (ii) unaccounted&#13;
non-technical losses arising mostly through theft or improper commercial&#13;
practices. This differentiation is important because on the technical side,&#13;
such losses affect mostly operating costs, while non-technical losses affect&#13;
mostly the revenue side of the operation. Together however, they are&#13;
factored to estimate the actual annual water production that is needed to&#13;
equate to the water sales derived by the projected consumption, which in&#13;
turn, is derived by the programmed installation of new service&#13;
connections.&#13;
d)    Water Sales Tariff Structure. Water sales are projected based on a tariff&#13;
structure that, with few exceptions consists of three parts: (i) a commodity&#13;
charge which is based by the size of meter that is installed, with more than&#13;
90% of the service connections using the 1/2 size; (ii) a usage charge with&#13;
individual tariffs varying by usage classification; and (iii) a one time&#13;
installation charge applied when the connection is made. In addition, the&#13;
water districts apply other charges such as in the case of Davao, where&#13;
instead of charging a customer guarantee deposit, a monthly meter rental&#13;
fee is applied.&#13;
e)    Sewerage Surcharge. Cost recovery of the sewerage operating and&#13;
maintenance expenses will be made on the basis of a user surcharge&#13;
applied as a percentage of the monthly water bill. The surcharge will vary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65                        ANNEX 3&#13;
among the various participating water districts due to differences in their&#13;
respective tariff structures.&#13;
f)    Discountsfor On-Time Payment. Most water districts apply a discount&#13;
ranging from 5% to 10% for prompt payment of the monthly water bill.&#13;
These discounts are directly offset against the total gross water sales.&#13;
g)    Penalties and Fines. Water districts also apply fine for overdue or late&#13;
payments prior to disconnecting service.&#13;
Operating Expenses&#13;
15.   Besides labor, power and chemicals comprise the major operating cost elements&#13;
for the supply and distribution of water. With regard to the sewerage, labor and again&#13;
power comprise the major cost elements for the treatrnent plant and the pump stations.&#13;
Capital Expenditures&#13;
16.   Capital expenses for each water district were estimated on the basis of assumed&#13;
needs for modernizing and rehabilitating the existing systems. In addition, planned&#13;
investmnent programs for network expansion as well as for increasing the supply of water&#13;
were factored in for each of the four participating water districts. The financing, whether&#13;
internal or external, for such investments were assumed based on representations from&#13;
management.&#13;

PHILIPPINES&#13;
WATER DISTRICTS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Land Bank of the Philippines&#13;
1.    The Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) was established in 1963 as a wholly&#13;
owned state bank and was initially mandated to finance the agrarian reform program of&#13;
the governmient. In 1973, the bank assumed full banking powers and began to accept&#13;
deposits as well as expand lending to commercial and institutional customers in addition&#13;
to continuing its traditional leading role in agriculture. At year-end 1996, the LBP's&#13;
capital totaled P13.4 billion, of which P7.7 has been paid-in.&#13;
A. Management and Structure&#13;
2.     LBP's charter specifies its board composition, management and scope of&#13;
operations. Four members of the Cabinet are ex-officio Directors, including the Secretary&#13;
of Finance, who is its Chairman. Until recently, bank operations were divided into four&#13;
major units headed by senior management which included: (i) Banking Sectors I and II&#13;
which focused on commercial loans, consumer and investment banking, and international&#13;
operations; (ii) the Agrarian Sector for the agricultural banking and technical support; and&#13;
(iii) the Operations and Executive Sector which focused on support services,&#13;
administration and finance functions.&#13;
3.    During 1996, the bank underwent a major reorganization in order to realign its&#13;
functions to a growing branch network and to rationalize an increased role in commercial&#13;
and consumer banking operations vis-a-vis its traditional agrarian financing role. The&#13;
Agrarian Sector was consolidated with other retail banking operations into the Agrarian&#13;
and Domestic Banking Sector. This group is headed by an Executive Vice President and&#13;
is essentially responsible for all branch operations. The bank currently has an extensive&#13;
branch network including 26 regional offices and 300 branches, making it between the&#13;
fourth and fifth largest commercial bank in the Philippines.&#13;
4.    Branches undertake most traditional retail operations including accepting&#13;
deposits, cash operations, consumer loans as well as lending to farmers cooperatives,&#13;
LGUs, small and medium enterprises and private corporations. Major accounts however,&#13;
are handled by the Institutional Banking Sector mostly staffed by the headquarters offices&#13;
in Makati. In addition, LBP engages in institutional strengthening activities for farmer&#13;
cooperatives, and in the collection of agrarian reform receivables from Comprehensive&#13;
Agrarian Reforms Program (CARP) beneficiaries.&#13;
5.    The staff complement is approximately 8,200 as of September 30, 1996, the&#13;
majority of which is distributed over the branch network.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
67                        ANNEX 4&#13;
B. Operations&#13;
6.    LBP divides its lending operation into Agrarian and Banking loans. Agrarian&#13;
loans consist primarily of: (i) Agrarian Reform Mortgages (ARM) which were designed&#13;
to provide mortgages to farmers who bought their land under the various agrarian reform&#13;
programs of the government; (ii) a small-farmer cooperative re-discounting program for&#13;
rural banks; and (iii) loans to farmer cooperatives. Like other commercial banks, LBP's&#13;
Banking sector loans consist primarily of loans to consumers, enterprises and government&#13;
on a range of terms and conditions, normally geared to between 3 to 4 points above the&#13;
marginal cost of funds. In addition, LBP provides financing to clients from special&#13;
sources, such as the Social Security Fund and targeted lines of credit from DBP and&#13;
international donor agencies.&#13;
7.    Since 1990, LBP has dramatically increased it's overall loan portfolio,&#13;
particularly in the Banking Sector. At year-end 1996, outstanding loans totaled&#13;
approximately P80.1 billion, 86.5% of which were in the Banking Sector. Over the six&#13;
year period starting from 1990, these loans grew 14-fold from P4.9 billion to P60.3&#13;
billion. By comparison, loans to small farmers (inclusive of Agrarian Reform Fund&#13;
loans) increased only modestly during the same period from P2.3 billion in 1990 to P10.7&#13;
billion in 1996, in part due to collections problems experienced in the past. Of the&#13;
existing loan portfolio, the bulk is presently allocated to private non-agricultural and&#13;
government clients, most of which are in the commercial sector. Agricultural loans have&#13;
largely remained unchanged between P9.2 billion to P10.7 billion since 1993.&#13;
8.    With such a dramatic increase in lending, there is also greater anticipation by&#13;
management for loan losses. In 1996, more than P1.5 billion was provided against loan&#13;
losses according to prescribed rules established by both the Land Bank and the Central&#13;
Bank of the Philippines. Particularly acute has been the problem in the Agrarian Sector&#13;
where almost half of the this portfolio is past due and can be considered doubtful.&#13;
However, provisions for this sector in 1996 were actually greater than what would be&#13;
prescribed by the Bank, thus showing the intent on the part of management to deal&#13;
conservatively with these problem loans. Agrarian loans accounted for 90% of total loan&#13;
losses charged against income during 1996 despite their relatively small volume to total&#13;
loans outstanding. The gains made in the banking sector however, more than&#13;
compensated for the poor performance on agrarian lending. As such, LBP's financial&#13;
condition actually improved marginally, with lower collection problems overall since&#13;
1990. In fact, in terms of the total loan portfolio, the percentage of past due loans has&#13;
consistently dropped from 1993 from more than 6% to 5.8% in 1995. Still, LBP&#13;
management is very concerned with its agrarian portfolio and has implemented an action&#13;
plan to improve collections, particularly from the farmer cooperatives where the problem&#13;
has been most severe. Such actions include:&#13;
a) Production loans for palay are now limited to those cooperatives operating in&#13;
key production areas;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
68                       ANNEX 4&#13;
b) Joint consultation between LBP and the Philippine Crop Insurance&#13;
Corporation to enhance collection under loan guaranteed;&#13;
c) Adoption of the accreditation standard for farmners' cooperatives;&#13;
d) Revalidation of top ten past due accounts per region;&#13;
e) Referral to Legal Department of willful defaulters; and&#13;
f) Periodic review and monitoring of potential problem accounts.&#13;
9.    As noted, the commercial loan portfolio has improved substantially both in total&#13;
volume and quality. Past due loans and loans in litigation have declined materially since&#13;
1993 from 2.9% of total outstanding commercial loans to less than 1.4% in 1996. In&#13;
essence, this has been a necessary improvement in performnance in this area of lending&#13;
and allowed LBP to largely mitigate the financial and operating dilemma imposed by the&#13;
agricultural sector.&#13;
C. Profitability&#13;
10.   LBP's net profits after provisions for loan losses, extraordinary items and income&#13;
taxes totaled P1.6 billion in 1996, or increased approximately 21% from 1995. This&#13;
translated to approximately 1.3% total return on assets and 13% return on equity. Total&#13;
returns have remained fairly constant largely due to the problem situation in the&#13;
agricultural area. This sector lost more than P2.15 billion in 1996 which had to be&#13;
absorbed by profits of more than P3.75 billion in the Banking Sector. Without the losses&#13;
incurred from the Agrarian Sector, LBP in 1996 would have realized a healthy 2.8%&#13;
return on total assets and a 28% return on equity.&#13;
11.  Interest income from loans comprised approximately 60.4% of the P13.1 billion&#13;
gross revenue earned by LBP in 1996. Investment income contributed more than P3.9&#13;
billion or 29% and other revenue from trading, fees, commissions and other&#13;
miscellaneous income comprised the remaining 10.6%. On the expense side, the total&#13;
cost of funds totaled P5.1 billion or 73% of total interest revenue generated from lending.&#13;
Adding the loans loss provision to this amount yields a total cost of lending operation of&#13;
approximately of P7.3 billion, or 92% of interest revenue. As a result, LBP is presently&#13;
just breaking even on its lending, realizing its profits largely from liquid funds invested in&#13;
short-term securities and other investments. Still, its operational performance is&#13;
respectable, given that it is the only major lender in the agricultural area and its mandate&#13;
to service smaller farmer cooperative which have traditionally been high credit risks.&#13;
12.   Despite the problems noted in the agricultural sector, LBP's contribution to the&#13;
Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) has improved from only P194 in&#13;
1991 to P1.2 billion in 1996. Starting from 1993, CARP expenses related to agrarian&#13;
lending were no longer chargeable to the special Agrarian Reform Fund. For this reason,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
69                       ANNEX 4&#13;
net profit growth has not been impressive in recent years. However, with the actions&#13;
being taken to improve loan portfolio quality, management expects to improve loan&#13;
collections in the near future. This, in turn will lessen or maintain at a reasonable level&#13;
LBP's contribution to CARP.&#13;
D.   Liquidity and Solvency&#13;
13.   Liquidity and solvency for LBP has declined over since 1989 and at year end&#13;
1996 LBP's liquidity and solvency ratios were 38.6% and 15.9%, respectively. This&#13;
position was roughly in line with those of other domestic commercial banks in the&#13;
Philippines where the average liquidity and solvency ratios were respectively, 31.3% and&#13;
19.9%. Some attention however, should be given to the solvency area, as LPB has had&#13;
increase its gearing position in order to offset lower margins on loans. Again, this is&#13;
likely in response to a need to compensate for the poor performance on the agrarian loans.&#13;
Despite this increase leveraged position, the bank remains adequately capitalized and risk&#13;
assets to equity are approximately 4.4 times and comparable to performance of other&#13;
banks in the Philippines.&#13;

76                        ANNEX 7&#13;
PHILIPPINES&#13;
WATER DISTRICTS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Assessment&#13;
I. Need for the Project&#13;
1.    The proposed Water Districts Development Project is expected to have a&#13;
beneficial effect on the environment of all participating cities. On the water supl side,&#13;
the Public Performance Audit (PPA) system for MWSS will ensure that policy makers,&#13;
the media, consumers and concessionaires will receive reliable and timely feedback on&#13;
service performance. The introduction of this full and transparent disclosure of&#13;
performance is expected to be the best safeguard against the exercise of monopoly power&#13;
in privatized water utilities. On the sewerage and sanitation side, the project preparation&#13;
team has made an assessment of existing environmental conditions in the four cities, and&#13;
evaluated the possible impacts of the project during construction, and after&#13;
implementation. The remaining part of this Annex will discuss the principal findings on&#13;
the environmental aspects of the sewerage, sanitation and drainage component of the&#13;
project. Annex 10 complements the information presented in this Annex.&#13;
2.    The proposed sewerage component is expected to have a beneficial effect on the&#13;
environment of the four participating cities, Davao, Cagayan de Oro, Cotabato city, and&#13;
Calamba. The provision of cost-effective and reliable wastewater collection, treatment&#13;
and disposal is a primary objective of this component. The choice of waste treatment&#13;
system will be guided by existing national legislation and regulations. In particular, it&#13;
should comply with the Presidential Decree No. 1586, also known as the Environmental&#13;
Impact Assessment Law as well as DENR Order Nos. 34 and 35, the Revised Water&#13;
Usage and Classification/Water Quality Criteria and Revised Effluent Regulations of&#13;
1990 respectively.&#13;
3.    Most urban centers in the Philippines rely on individual septic tank systems for&#13;
the treatment and disposal of wastewater from domestic and commercial buildings.&#13;
However, the designs for such systems are often inadequate. Facilities for land disposal&#13;
of effluents from the septic tanks are generally absent. Hence the partially treated septic&#13;
tank effluents flow directly into storm drainage systems and other receiving bodies of&#13;
water, thereby exacerbating an already grave pollution situation.&#13;
4.    There are several possible options for addressing this problem, including&#13;
improving the design of the septic tank system with the installation of soil absorption&#13;
systems. But an environmentally sound alternative that is cost-effective and captures&#13;
economies of scale is to connect individual properties directly to a sewerage system for&#13;
the collection, treatment and disposal of the urban wastes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77                        ANNEX 7&#13;
5.    Better sanitary conditions will thus be experienced in the areas served by the&#13;
sewerage, drainage and sanitation systems. This will reduce water-borne pollution and&#13;
water-logging within the cities and in the surrounding water bodies, thereby bringing&#13;
health benefits to local populations. In Davao, Cagayan de Oro and Calamba cities,&#13;
pollution from human waste has affected recreational areas, such as beaches and lake&#13;
fronts. Project investments in wastewater collection and treatment will also have positive&#13;
benefits in terms of improving prospects of saving the remaining beaches for the city&#13;
residents. The construction of the systems will protect shallow groundwater aquifers from&#13;
contamination, particularly in Toril area of Davao city, which forms the source of the&#13;
city's water supply system.&#13;
II. Environmental Clearance Process in the Philippines&#13;
6.    As a part of the processing, all project components will be reviewed by the&#13;
Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) under the&#13;
Environmental Impact Statement Law, and discussed in City Councils. DENR issuance of&#13;
Environmental Clearance Certificates (ECCs) will be a condition of disbursement for&#13;
each of the four sub-projects. A separate EIA report complying with the GOP and Bank&#13;
formats is currently under finalization for Davao city. Once this is completed, the&#13;
borrower will be requested to complete similar EIAs for the remaining four cities before&#13;
loan effectiveness. A Process Guidance Summary and generic terms of reference for use&#13;
by the remaining LGUs have been prepared, and will be reviewed and finalized with the&#13;
borrower during appraisal.&#13;
7.    Based on the review of the Davao EIA and other related documents, an overall&#13;
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for each city will be prepared. The EMP will be&#13;
imnplemented by the PMUs in each of the participating cities, under guidance from the&#13;
PMO. The plan will be integrated into bidding and contract documents, and the&#13;
contractors responsible for project activities will be responsible for implementing&#13;
environmental management plan. The PMO will be responsible for monitoring and&#13;
reporting compliance.&#13;
III. Environmental Setting&#13;
8.    The four cities participating in the project represent a cross-section of secondary&#13;
Philippine cities with no sewerage infrastructure. Table A 7.1 summarizes their&#13;
characteristics relevant to the environmental assessment.&#13;

9.     The urban area/built-up area in the project cities is characterized by a heavy con-&#13;
centration of commercial and industrial activities. It is the area where population density&#13;
is highest. These areas are also represent the bulk of economic activity in the informal&#13;
sector - such as, the production and consumption of raw and processed food, light&#13;
manufacturing activities and retail distribution. A large proportion of piped water supply&#13;
from the local Water District is also consumed in the Central Business District. Con-&#13;
sequently, the pressure from both solid and liquid wastes in these areas greatly exceed the&#13;
capability of the land and water resources to absorb, assimilate and recycle them.&#13;
Selection of Priority Cities&#13;
10.    The choice of the first batch of Philippine cities for sewerage investments was&#13;
made after an initial screening at the national level of urban areas facing the most serious&#13;
problem of pollution by untreated wastes. Of the four cities, Davao and Cagayan de Oro&#13;
represent the largest class of provincial cities with current population estimates in the&#13;
range of a million and half a million respectively. There are several major population&#13;
concentrations in each city; each being a source of sewage contamination for nearby&#13;
surface and ground water. However, the largest volume of sewage is generated by the&#13;
largest consumers of piped water supply; in the Central Business District or Poblacion&#13;
area. Untreated wastewater from this area has polluted low-lying coastal areas, and&#13;
basically converted the principal rivers into open sewers. The scale of the pollution&#13;
problem can be appreciated by the fact that about 90 per cent of the daily water supply of&#13;
140,000 cubic meters in Davao city and 76,000 cubic meters in Cagayan de Oro is being&#13;
discharged as untreated wastewater. Outside the Poblacion areas, there are pockets of&#13;
population concentrations polluting nearby streams, creeks and channels.&#13;
11.    In the other two cities of medium size (Cotabato city and Calamba), current&#13;
population estimates are close to 200,000. While the scale of urban pollution problems&#13;
are not comparable with Davao and Cagayan de Oro, these cities are located close to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
79                        ANNEX 7&#13;
environmentally sensitive wetlands and water bodies. In Cotabato city, the urban area is&#13;
actually below the mean sea level, exposing inhabitants to frequent waterlogging during&#13;
the monsoon months. Calamba is located on the shores of Laguna Lake, which has&#13;
experienced a rapid deterioration in water quality over the last two decades. In each of&#13;
two cities, Mayors and city officials have recognized for some time that unless their&#13;
complex environmental problems are tackled through a strategic plan of handling waste&#13;
disposal, sustainability of urban growth could be seriously affected.&#13;
IV. Environmental Planning of Project Components&#13;
12.   The proposed project follows a demand-based approach, in that facilities will be&#13;
constructed only if they conform to the preferences of local stakeholders, and services&#13;
conform to their respective willingness to pay. The stakeholders represent the different&#13;
tiers of organizations from the City Council and Barangay (part of the formal LGU&#13;
system), to the more informal purok, neighborhood and household levels. During project&#13;
preparation, the idea of involving communities in the planning process was field-tested in&#13;
three barangays of Davao city, and found to be quite successful. The basic decision-&#13;
making process is as follows:&#13;
(a)   For the capital-intensive trunk system, consisting of the main&#13;
transportation sewers, primary drains and wastewater treatment facilities,&#13;
the project design and implementation plan has to be approved by the City&#13;
Council, because the latter is responsible to repay the loan (see Annex 3 on&#13;
Financial Aspects).&#13;
(b)   For the feeder system, consisting of collector sewers, secondary drains&#13;
and on-site sanitation facilities, barangays and local neighborhoods will be&#13;
associated with the planning and implementation program. The design&#13;
criteria have been simplified, so that the feeder system can respond to&#13;
local preferences and willingness to pay, rather than be bound by any&#13;
conventional sewer design criteria used in industrialized countries.&#13;
Detailed design will be conducted through a participatory process&#13;
described in Annex 12.&#13;
13.   Given the capital-intensive nature of the investments, the proposed project is only&#13;
the initial phase of a program to improve the sanitation infrastructure through a strategic&#13;
planning approach that involves a mix of on-site and off-site wastewater collection,&#13;
treatment and disposal. Choice of initial service areas for sewerage has been confined to&#13;
the Central Business Districts or Poblacion areas because these are the major contributors&#13;
to municipal wastewater pollution. The only exception made is in the case of Davao&#13;
City, where a second area of high growth prospects (Toril) has also been included on the&#13;
request of the LGU.&#13;
14.   The project will construct a sewer network that will discharge sewage to a verti-&#13;
cally integrated pond system designed to treat both sewage and septage. In each of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
80                        ANNEX 7&#13;
cities, with the exception of Davao, the treatment site was selected in areas free from&#13;
encumbrances.&#13;
15.   For the sanitation and drainage components, the entire city has been included in&#13;
the project area, with final selections being made on the basis of demand. On-site&#13;
treatment systems through the construction of VIP latrines, pit latrines, pour flush toilets&#13;
and septic tanks will also be constructed if there is demand from property owners. For&#13;
those properties with uncertain land tenure (as in squatter settlements), the project will&#13;
finance the construction of communal toilets, to be managed by NGOs and/or the private&#13;
sector. The specific location of these facilities will be driven by the willingness to pay for&#13;
the services by beneficiaries at the barangay level, provided of course that these are&#13;
technically feasible.&#13;
16.   The recommended solutions for wastewater treatment were arrived at after an&#13;
intensive process of evaluating alternatives during the project preparation in order to&#13;
achieve cost effectiveness and acceptability. The alternatives considered were&#13;
anaerobic/facultative Ponds, modified lagoon systems and mechanical treatment. In all&#13;
the four cities evaluation of alternatives indicated that the modified lagoon system,&#13;
despite having a higher O&amp;M costs compared to anaerobic/facultative ponds (as it&#13;
requires mechanical aerators and recirculation pumps) was appropriate. Details are&#13;
available in project files. The selected option meets the following criteria:&#13;
(a)   Minimize overall pond area required&#13;
(b)   Minimize odor production&#13;
(c)   Meet DENR effluent quality criteria, including fecal coliform reduction&#13;
(d)   Minimize sludge production rate&#13;
(e)   Maximize potential to use surrounding land for recreational purposes&#13;
V. Description of Impacts in Davao City&#13;
Impact During Construction Phase&#13;
17.   The implementation of the project and its components is projected to produce&#13;
only minimal adverse environmental impacts. The socio-economic impacts will be&#13;
beneficial, and will result in a better standard of living for the municipalities and cities&#13;
concemed. In the short-term the project will provide employment and livelihood&#13;
opportunities to the population of the surrounding communities through the jobs&#13;
generated during the construction phase. In the long-term, better sanitary conditions will&#13;
reduce sicknesses caused by water-related problems. Thus an improvement of the existing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
81                        ANNEX 7&#13;
environmental conditions is expected. The project will undertake mitigating measures to&#13;
minimize, or if at all possible, eliminate adverse impacts.&#13;
18.   Air Quality. The implementation of the project will result in an increase in the&#13;
ambient concentration of suspended particulates in the vicinity of the project site. This&#13;
would be attributed to dust from land clearing and excavation activities, which expose&#13;
soil to wind and vehicular traffic over unpaved road.&#13;
19.   Water Quality. Excavation activities in the project sites could also loosen soils&#13;
and transport these materials to any surface waters, thereby increasing siltation and&#13;
turbidity.&#13;
20.   During the rainy season, surface runoff may increase total suspended solids, and&#13;
cause temporary stress at the discharge points. However, the impact will be localized, and&#13;
when the vegetative cover returns, impact on the receiving body of water caused by&#13;
surface run-off will be eliminated.&#13;
21.   Noise. The noise impact during the construction stage is expected to be generally&#13;
minimal and will not require any special noise abatement measure. The treatment plant&#13;
sites shall have a setback away from residential clusters, which will definitely provide the&#13;
necessary buffer to reduce noise impact during construction of the modified lagoon&#13;
systems.&#13;
22.   During the pipe-laying, some noise will be generated due to the construction&#13;
activities and the temporary operation of heavy equipment. Noise from breaking concrete&#13;
pavement and sidewalks may also pose a temporary problem. However, the noise level at&#13;
the streets is expected to be within the ambient noise quality standards.&#13;
23.   Socio-economic. The only potentially adverse impact is likely to be in the Davao&#13;
sewage treatment site, where approximately 15 squatter structures are located in the&#13;
vicinity of the treatment plant site. The treatment plant, can, however, be constructed&#13;
without affecting these structures, and hence no resettlement action plan will be required.&#13;
The City Governments will be requested at appraisal to indicate how they plan monitor&#13;
potentially adverse impacts in the project cities.&#13;
24.   Ecological Effects. As there are no rare, endemic species of flora and fauna in&#13;
any of the project area, project implementation has minimal impact on the terrestrial eco-&#13;
logy. Vegetative cover shall be unavoidably cleared during civil works.&#13;
Impacts During Operation Phase&#13;
25    Air Quality. The operation of the wastewater treatrnent facility will have&#13;
minimal impact on the air quality of the area. Aside from the occasional odor nuisance, it&#13;
is not projected to have adverse effect at all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82                       ANNEX 7&#13;
26    Water Quality. The implementation of the project will be beneficial to the&#13;
general environment of participating cities and their environs. Discharging of untreated&#13;
domestic waste water from the high volume consumers in each city's Central Business&#13;
Districts into nearby bodies of water would thus be minimized or eliminated. However,&#13;
operations and maintenance failures may result in occasional discharges.&#13;
27    Socio-economic. The provision of sanitation facilities in the project cities would&#13;
undoubtedly benefit the general populace of these areas. The occurrence of epidemic-&#13;
scale diseases caused by current unsanitary conditions will be reduced. This will result in&#13;
a more healthy and productive population.&#13;
28.   Sludge Disposal. The modified lagoon system or Advanced Improved Ponds&#13;
System (AIPS) will require sludge disposal at very infrequent intervals. The sludge in the&#13;
anaerobic pond/s remains for an extended period continuously undergoing organic&#13;
decomposition. This may take place over a 20-30 year period. One system in operation&#13;
in the U.S. has not been desludged in thirty years. Recent testing of this system has&#13;
indicated that the sludge is well-digested and very stable. If desludging does become due,&#13;
arrangements can easily be made with the city environment office for disposal at the&#13;
sanitary landfill.&#13;
29.   Mitigating measures to minimize, or if possible, eliminate adverse impact will be&#13;
implemented. Measures to enhance the existing environmental conditions in the project&#13;
site shall be implemented to maintain the environmental sustainability of the area. The&#13;
implementation of the project will, inevitably produce impact, both adverse and benefi-&#13;
cial. Table A 7.2 shows the potential impact, risks and the proposed mitigating action.&#13;
VI. Implementation and Monitoring of Management Plan&#13;
30.   The PMO, with the assistance of LWUA-CPSO and consultants, would monitor&#13;
compliance with the ECC and carry out the requisite data collection. Monitoring reports&#13;
would be submitted to DENRIEMB and the World Bank periodically. While&#13;
responsibility for the various mitigation activities have been identified, the PMO will&#13;
ensure that the requirements are complied within addition, feedback from communities,&#13;
city officials, NGOs, etc. will be pro-actively sought through the city public affairs&#13;
programs, regular monthly meetings of barangay captains and other methods. Finally,&#13;
DENR, through its planned PPA system, would also periodically monitor and audit&#13;
compliance with the ECC, assisted by independent contractors.&#13;
31.   Table A 7.3 summarizes the responsibilities and timetable for the Mitigation Plan.&#13;

Environmental Management and Protected Areas Service of DENR. This agency is&#13;
currently monitoring the status of river and estuarine water quality through its Regional&#13;
Technical Directorates on a regular basis. PMO will collect information on present&#13;
conditions, observed changes in pollution loads etc. It should be noted that all the&#13;
pollution load will not be removed because the sewerage infrastructure will only service a&#13;
limited area in each participating city.&#13;

VII. Impact of Land Acquisition for the Project&#13;
33.    Table A 7.4 summarizes the requirements of land in the four cities. The project&#13;
documents have assumed that private lands will have to be acquired at market rates. In&#13;
addition, the rights of squatter famnilies are protected under the provisions of the&#13;
Philippine Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992 (RA No. 7279). The&#13;
Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Act requires that persons affected by&#13;
government infrastructure projects must be adequately consulted and adequately&#13;
compensated.&#13;
34.    In the context of the proposed sewerage investments, given the political&#13;
difficulties in exercising the right of eminent domain, LGUs will pay compensation based&#13;
on market prices. Fair compensation is therefore built into the purchase price. As&#13;
described in Annex 13, the Community Participation Process is built into project design,&#13;
in order to ensure that the spirit of RA No. 7279 is not violated. Table A 7.4 summarizes&#13;
the characteristics of land to be acquired for the project. In addition, some small parcels&#13;
of land may be required for construction of pump stations.&#13;

Project Implementation and Supervision Plan for SSD Component&#13;
1.    The project implementation arrangements will enable the Government to test how&#13;
best the directives of NEDA Board Resolution Number 5 can be implemented, so that a&#13;
replicable model is developed for future sewerage investments in the Philippines. A&#13;
notable feature is to plan and construct sewerage and sanitation investments, based on&#13;
demand from LGUs and urban residents.&#13;

2.    The project will be implemented by the LGU administrations through Project&#13;
Management Units (PMUs) in each of the four cities (Davao, Cotabato city, Cagayan de&#13;
Oro and Calamba). Coordination of cross-cutting project and policy issues, liaison with&#13;
the national government agencies and the Bank will be conducted through a Project&#13;
Management Office, set up at the Land Bank. Figure A 8.1 summarizes the organization&#13;
of implementation. For the Water Utilities Private Sector Development component&#13;
MWSS and LWUA will implement the PPA and WUPSPF investments respectively.&#13;

88                        ANNEX 8&#13;
3.    As described in Table A 8. 1, the PMU at the LGU level has the responsibility to&#13;
implement the project. However, as this is a new experience for its staff, technical&#13;
assistance through consultants will be provided from the national level through the&#13;
project cycle. The arrangements proposed divides responsibilities between the PMO and&#13;
PMU as follow:&#13;
(a)   The PMO will be responsible for project management, design and&#13;
supervision. In order to ensure that the design has been satisfactorily&#13;
implemented, a single design and supervision consultancy will be awarded&#13;
at the national level. The terms of reference for the consultancy (see&#13;
Annex 12), provides adequate safeguard to ensure that participating LGUs&#13;
are fully involved in the Consultant selection process.&#13;
(b)   The PMU will be responsible for day-to-day project implementation. It&#13;
will be responsible for procuring the contractor for the civil works&#13;
contracts, and supervising the contractor performance. The PMU could&#13;
call upon technical support from the local Water District, CPSO-LWUA or&#13;
PMO consultants, as and when required.&#13;

II. Bank Supervision&#13;
5.       Bank staff requirements will be of two forms. First, to attend to the regular&#13;
supervision needs about 5 staff weeks will be required each year for the duration of the&#13;
project at headquarters. This will be mainly to review progress reports, procurement&#13;
actions, correspondence, etc. Second, more specialized inputs are required for supervising&#13;
specific project components. In both the PPA component and SSD component the&#13;
requirements for specialized inputs are relatively high, estimated for the project period at&#13;
48 staff weeks in the field, given the innovative nature of some key subcomponents (i.e.&#13;
establishing the PPA, ensuring that communities participate in engineering design).&#13;
Table A 8.3 summarizes these requirements.&#13;

6.    Overall coordination of the project would be the responsibility of the Land Bank&#13;
of Philippines for the sewerage components, and of MWSS for the PPA component. This&#13;
would include inter alia (i) providing guidance on timing and form of reporting&#13;
implementation progress; (ii) arranging meetings with government officials during&#13;
mission's field visits; (iii) chairing mission's opening and wrap-up meetings; and&#13;
ensuring timely information to the Bank and proposals for satisfactory resolution of any&#13;
unexpected issue during implementation.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
93                           ANNEX 9&#13;
PHILIPPINES&#13;
WATER DISTRICTS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
I. Overview&#13;
1.    The Water District Development Project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) system -&#13;
which will be confirmed at negotiations - will be designed to provide project managers with&#13;
infornation on progress made towards accomplishing project objectives and its impact on&#13;
beneficiaries. Information on institutional, technical and financial aspects will also be&#13;
periodically collected so that the specific needs of a 'bottom-up', transparent, project design are&#13;
met.&#13;
2.    The M&amp;E system has two distinct aspects. The first relates to tracking quantitative&#13;
information showing financial and physical progress in achieving project milestones. The second&#13;
relates to reviewing the impact of project implementation, so that there is an opportunity to&#13;
change or modify the succeeding year's program design. The latter depends on the extent to&#13;
which information gathered enables WDs, LGUs, PMO, the national agencies and the World&#13;
Bank understand what appears to be working and what isn't during the course of project&#13;
implementation. Financial and physical progress will be gathered from (i) PMUs, LGUs, and&#13;
WDs' routine reports on financial and accounting information and (ii) project team staff and&#13;
consultants during studies, design works, and project supervisions. The impact of project&#13;
implementation will be documented through user consultations, workshops, and supervision&#13;
missions. Collected information will be analyzed jointly by project consultants, WDs, LGUs,&#13;
CPSO/LWUA, PMO, and the World Bank. Implementation details of the feedback mechanisms&#13;
will be discussed and confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
3.    Performance monitoring indicators, which can be both numeric and qualitative, will be&#13;
finalized through a collaborative process involving Bank staff and project stakeholders (defined&#13;
as beneficiary communities, WDs, LGUs, and national agencies). The indicators are classified&#13;
into the following categories:&#13;
a) Input indicrs measuring the quantity (and sometimes also quality) of resources&#13;
provided for activities related to subprojects.&#13;
b) Outu indicators measuring the quantity (and sometimes quality) of services that have&#13;
been created or provided through the use of inputs.&#13;
c) Outcome indicators measuring the quantity (and sometimes quality) of direct results that&#13;
have been achieved through the provision of project services.&#13;
d) Impact indicators measuring the degree to which wider sector/project objectives are being&#13;
achieved through the direct outcomes of project activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
94                           ANNEX 9&#13;
4.    Overall, input/output indicators are measures of implementation perfornance, and&#13;
outcome/impact indicators form the basis for monitoring the impact of the project. These&#13;
indicators will be supplemented by qualitative evaluations of project performance.&#13;
5     The project expects to incorporate the lessons learned from each stage of implementation&#13;
in the subsequent phases of the project cycle. In other words, the success of the proposed&#13;
program of investments and technical assistance will depend on the quality of the Monitoring&#13;
and Evaluation system.&#13;
II. Summary of M&amp;E Responsibilities&#13;
6.    M&amp;E of project performance requires a collaborative effort involving all the project&#13;
stakeholders. Table A 9.1 below shows how M&amp;E responsibilities will be shared among the&#13;
different stakeholders. The project's primary stakeholders (the beneficiaries in the project areas&#13;
at the Barangay levels) will have the responsibilities of providing basic information, while the&#13;
project teams at the PMUs and PMO will gather and analyze quantitative and qualitative&#13;
information. Barangay, puroks and neighborhood blocks will provide feedback on a regular&#13;
basis.&#13;

9.2 shows the proposed set of performance monitoring indicators for monitoring the&#13;
effectiveness of the PPA component. The criteria for succes of the pilot system will be:&#13;
- Positive consumer feedback on its utility&#13;
- Establishment of a fully functional, privatized PPA system in MWSS by 1999&#13;
- Diffusion rate of public performance accounting (PPA) system in other Philippine water&#13;
utilities in the subsequent years.&#13;

PHILIPPINES&#13;
WATER DISTRICTS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Economic Analysis Of Sewerage Investments&#13;
I. Sewerage Options in Four Philippine Cities: Environmental Economics and&#13;
Project Choice&#13;
1.    Under the national policy of decentralization, public works projects of local&#13;
concern will be developed and financed by Local Government Units. Utilizing revenues&#13;
from its local tax base and block transfers from the annual Internal Revenue Allocations&#13;
(IRA), each province, city and barangay provides services appropriate for its level of&#13;
Government. In the context of the project, the City Council plans, taxes and appropriates&#13;
funds for city-wide infrastructural and human services while the barangays administer&#13;
programs within their neighborhoods. While the decentralization policies have effectively&#13;
augmented the resource base of City Governments (see Annex 3), at the barangay level,&#13;
the resource base is small, and there is a much greater reliance on voluntarism. Below the&#13;
barangay, residents often organize themselves in purok or informal neighborhood groups.&#13;
2.   In past Bank-funded sewerage projects, economic analysis has been either absent&#13;
or at best perfunctory because the benefits are not easily quantifiable in physical or&#13;
monetary terms. Standard practice has therefore not included calculation of economic&#13;
rates of return based on full cost-benefit analysis. However, significant health and&#13;
environmental improvements have been attributed to these projects, and designs have&#13;
generally been selected on cost-effectiveness criteria. In the Water Districts&#13;
Development Project, least-cost analysis was conducted using cost data for two to three&#13;
technical options for sewerage investments in each participating city.&#13;
3.    The project team, however, made an attempt to verify how far the least cost&#13;
analyses withstood the test of standard cost-benefit analysis. An attempt was made to&#13;
quantify the benefits and costs for the, two biggest sewerage subprojects in Davao and&#13;
Cagayan de Oro (accounting for about 61 per cent of the total project investments), and a&#13;
summary of the findings for Davao city is described in Section III. The conclusion drawn&#13;
was that despite the methodological difficulties involved in utilizing a cost-benefit&#13;
analysis, the project investments could be justified on conventional grounds. In addition,&#13;
the project designs have been selected by elected officials facing hard budget constraints,&#13;
attractive alternatives for social investments, and a re-election campaign within the next&#13;
eighteen months. Their favorable decision also reflects a host of intangible factors (e.g.&#13;
amenities, valuation of life, wetland preservation) which are at best approximated by the&#13;
conventional cost-benefit analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
99                          ANNEX 10&#13;
II. Environmental Economics and Project Design&#13;
4.    Sewerage project choice must consider a host of questions, whose answers often&#13;
depend on first-hand knowledge of the community and its geographic setting:&#13;
(a)   Where are the sources of sewage contamination?&#13;
(b)   Where are the contaminated areas?&#13;
(c)   What are the impacts of contamination on health, economic activity and&#13;
recreational opportunity?&#13;
(d)   What are the least-cost methods for addressing each critical problem?&#13;
(e)   How much investment in sanitation is appropriate for the community, in&#13;
light of other needs?&#13;
5.    Human waste is generated by households in proportion to their size, and liquid&#13;
waste in proportion to the water consumed. With the exception of some areas in Manila,&#13;
Baguio city and Vigan, households in Philippines are not connected to sewerage systems.&#13;
Poorly-maintained residential septic tanks overflow into open drains or leak into the&#13;
ground water, and poor people in squatter settlements empty their human and liquid&#13;
waste directly into nearby surface waters. Densely-settled areas are therefore the biggest&#13;
sources of potential contamination&#13;
6.    Households will usually solve their own sewage problems if they perceive the&#13;
danage to themselves as serious, and can afford the necessary remediation measures.&#13;
The most common private response is a simple latrine, which collects human wastes,&#13;
while the wastewater is channeled to open drains to transport them away from the&#13;
household. For the neighborhood as a whole, of course, this private expedient is no&#13;
solution because surface and ground waters will receive the untreated wastewater.&#13;
During user consultations conducted as a part of project preparation, there was&#13;
widespread recognition of the localized pollution problems, and the implications these&#13;
had for the health and welfare of communities. Neighborhood groups responded&#13;
favorably to the 'polluter pays' principle, though there was recognition that voluntary&#13;
labor, rather than payment, was easier to mobilize as a part of the mitigation effort.&#13;
Informal groups, for example, were prepared to mobilize community labor to clean the&#13;
drains, do simple earthworks, etc., in order to improve their neighborhood environment.&#13;
At the City or LGU level, there was a corresponding recognition that city-wide&#13;
externalities had to be mitigated by the City administration from its budgetary resources.&#13;
At the same time, officials pointed out the difficulty in enforcing pollution control rules&#13;
throughout the city, because their monitoring capability was very limited, and because&#13;
differentiated charges or remediation fees would be politically difficult to set.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
100                            ANNEX 10&#13;
7.    The project design has sought to address the problem of free riding at the&#13;
neighborhood and community levels by following the principle of subsidiarity: decisions&#13;
are taken at the lowest level which is effective. For example, within cities, individual&#13;
communities will be willing to support measures which are clearly in their own interest.&#13;
Options are discussed on how their neighborhoods can be kept clean: the open drain&#13;
could be kept free from garbage; the wastewater from houses could be collected by a&#13;
shallow sewer; or a larger pipe could be installed to carry all wastewater and stormwater&#13;
out of the neighborhood. Each of the options has an investment cost and an operations&#13;
and maintenance (O&amp;M) cost associated with it. Decisions are taken at the purok or&#13;
neighborhood levels on which option will be chosen, and how these will be financed.&#13;
Since these communities will differ greatly in income, applying the principle of&#13;
subsidiarity would imply that choices would vary widely in coverage, characteristics and&#13;
cost:&#13;
(a)   In low income squatter settlements, the preference is generally for a clean,&#13;
well-maintained communal toilet. The project design has sought to ensure&#13;
the cleanliness of the facilities by involving the private sector and NGOs&#13;
to operate and maintain these facilities.&#13;
(b)   In low-income residential areas the preference is usually for a VIP latrine&#13;
or septic tanks. The project will acquaint communities with the&#13;
wastewater disposal options, and will encourage them to develop a&#13;
barangay-level sanitation action plan. Depending on the preferences and&#13;
willingness to pay of residents the option of sewering the neighborhood or&#13;
simply improving septage and drainage management will be made by the&#13;
project team.&#13;
(c)   In relatively high income areas, consumption of water is also relatively&#13;
high, and the public good diverges from private perceptions of benefits.&#13;
Typically, when a city begins to sprout high rise buildings (as all the four&#13;
Poblacion areas have), the pollution caused by untreated wastewater&#13;
disposal by property owners gets amplified. In these situations, user&#13;
involvement in decision-making alone is not sufficient to tackle free-rider&#13;
problems.' In these cases the project team will have to seek financial&#13;
support from general LGU revenues, although the costs of individual&#13;
property connections will be paid by users.&#13;
8.    In all cases, once a person has signed onto connecting with a sewer line, collection&#13;
of O&amp;M charges will be ensured by joining water and sewerage services under the local&#13;
Water District. The threat of interrupted water service will generally be sufficient to&#13;
assure payment for sewerage.&#13;
An owner of a large five-floored building, for example, may be satisfied with an oversized septic tank&#13;
and soakaway to dispose the wastewater generated. However, this untreated water pollutes&#13;
groundwater and open water courses of the neighborhood.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
101                            ANNEX 10&#13;
9.    To sum up, the project approach has been to craft institutional rules that move&#13;
investment decisions toward securing parity between marginal benefits and costs. By&#13;
applying the principle of subsidiarity, the project design ensures that neighborhoods&#13;
decide separately and collectively on how and when to participate in the project. The&#13;
offer of a choice of service levels allows even poor communities to locally resolve human&#13;
waste disposal problems as the technologies offer a range of unit costs. Adoption of&#13;
industrial-country treatment standards, on the other hand, may drastically increase costs&#13;
while affording only modest additional benefits.&#13;
III. Sewerage Issues in Four Philippine Cities&#13;
10.   This project is demand-driven, because sewerage coverage and siting decisions&#13;
are in the hands of elected community representatives operating under a hard budget&#13;
constraint. The Bank's technical team has assisted the LGU administrations with&#13;
identification of pollution sources, impact assessment, and cost estimates for altemative&#13;
approaches to remediation. Table A 10.1 summarizes the key issues which have emerged&#13;
during meetings between Bank staff and the leaders of the four cities. It illustrates the&#13;
diversity of these cities, and the corresponding variation in their environmental and&#13;
economic concems. On two issues, however, all the cities are unified: morbidity and&#13;
mortality from sewage contamination (particularly among children), and the likelihood&#13;
that private investment will lag in cities with non-sewered central business districts&#13;
because of the strict enforcement of DENR regulations for on-site treatment facilities.&#13;
11.   Within the time and budgetary limits of project preparation, in-depth analyses&#13;
have not been possible for all four cities. Detailed assessments for Davao City and&#13;
Cagayan de Oro have been prepared, and used as reference documents for assessment&#13;
exercises with community leaders in Cotabato and Calamba.2&#13;

An Illustration for Davao&#13;
12.   The basic geography of Davao City is depicted in Figure A 10.1. The city has&#13;
several major population concentrations, each a source of sewage contamination for&#13;
nearby surface and ground waters. Impact assessment has focused on four factors:&#13;
Human health, beach recreation, fisheries and land values. The basic conclusions of the&#13;
assessment are as follows:&#13;
13.   Health-related problems from sewage contamination are of uncertain magnitude,&#13;
but are clearly important to the city leadership. The available evidence suggests that the&#13;
rate (per capita) of infection from sewage-related diarrheal disease is roughly constant&#13;
across populous districts with the possible exception of Matina.&#13;
14.   Pollution of Davao Gulf near each beach is closely related to drainage from the&#13;
neighboring population. Times and Kalayaan Beaches presently have the worst&#13;
contamination. There has been a sharp reduction in beach visits as Davao's residents have&#13;
become aware of the contamination problem. Pollution reduction will depend on the&#13;
proportion of the local population whose sewage is treated or safely removed from septic&#13;
tanks.&#13;
15.   Fishing productivity in the Gulf of Davao has declined, but sewage contamination&#13;
has not been a significant factor.&#13;
16.   Commercial development in the Poblacion district is repressed by the absence of&#13;
sewerage. Installation of a system would permit high-rise construction and a significant&#13;
increase in property values, both from commercial development and improvements in&#13;
health and environmental quality.&#13;
&#13;

17.   These findings have been used to prepare a conventional analysis of health and&#13;
recreational benefits for sewerage in Poblacion, which includes the central business&#13;
district and is the proposed site for 80% of project investments.3 The estimated&#13;
investment cost for sewerage in Poblacion is P 552 million, with an additional P 14&#13;
million in annual operations and maintenance expenses.4 Treating O&amp;M costs as a&#13;
perpetuity at a 14% discount rate (the interest rate for the loan) yields a present&#13;
discounted cost (PDC) of P100 million, and an estimated total PDC of P652 million. By&#13;
comparison, a conservative valuation of health and recreational benefits yields a present&#13;
discounted value (PDV) of about P29 million. More optimistic estimates of health and&#13;
recreational impacts yield a PDV of P277 million. Health benefits are estimated from&#13;
medical costs avoided and working days saved by reduced sewage contamination, with&#13;
no weight assigned to pain and suffering. Recreational benefits are estimated as travel&#13;
savings from renewed access to contaminated beaches near the city; no value is assigned&#13;
to pure amenity benefits. This approach to valuation does not yield benefit estimates&#13;
commensurate with project costs, but there is no reason to suppose that community&#13;
Please see the Appendix for details.&#13;
4O&amp;M expenses are expected to be lower during the first years of system operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
104                              ANNEX 10&#13;
leaders will value project benefits without taking account of pain, suffering, non-&#13;
quantifiable ecosystem benefits, and enviromnental amenities.&#13;
18.   Additional evidence on valuation of project benefits has been provided by&#13;
household surveys of willingness-to-pay for sewerage in Davao City. The results lie&#13;
within the range of P 300-600 annually per household (for slightly more than 27,000&#13;
households), yielding PDVs in the range of P 60-119 million. Again, there is a&#13;
substantial shortfall from project costs. However, the willingness-to-pay survey does not&#13;
incorporate the judgment of commercial developers who will be the key players in central&#13;
business district activity after the installation of sewerage. In addition, the surveyed&#13;
households did not have access to the detailed information on potential benefits and costs&#13;
which was made available to community leaders during discussion of the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
19.   Land values internalize many external benefits, so a third approach to benefit&#13;
valuation considered the potential for land value increases as the result of sewerage&#13;
installation. In Davao City, the area of the Central Business District is approximately&#13;
1000 hectares. Land values range from P1000 per square meter to P15,000 per square&#13;
meter; the city estimate of average value is currently P3,500 per square meter. With the&#13;
project, land values are projected to increase sharply for two reasons.&#13;
20.   First, Davao city is experiencing rapid growth as the premier city of the Mindanao&#13;
region. Growth has been brought about by industrial investments, growth of agro-&#13;
processing activities and tourism development in the Mt. Apo-Toril area. There is clearly&#13;
strong potential for high-rise construction in the Central Business District (CBD).&#13;
21.   Second, DENR is currently tightening enforcement of regulations for on-site&#13;
treatment in high-rise buildings. Although no estimates for the Philippines are available, a&#13;
similar study conducted in Jakarta showed that property developers have to incur&#13;
substantial fixed and variable costs in operating and maintaining package treatment plants&#13;
for treating high volume wastewater generated by high-rise buildings.5 Under these&#13;
circumstances, property developers prefer to site high rise buildings on urban land with&#13;
sewerage services. This demand substantially increases land values.&#13;
22.   For Davao city, project consultants have estimated that sewerage in the CBD&#13;
would augment land values by approximately 20 per cent. For the benefits assessment,&#13;
however, a very modest 5% increase has been assumed. Using an estimated current value&#13;
5The Jakarta estimates, undertaken as a part of a World Bank study, indicated that developers incur&#13;
average investment costs of $45,000 for package treatment plants in one of these buildings, and&#13;
annual variable costs varying between $16.60 and $1.60 per square meter of floor area respectively&#13;
for hotels, apartment blocks (i.e. large water users) and for smaller office buildings (i.e. small water&#13;
users).&#13;
6 Tis reflects observed increases (above trend) of around 20% after installation of sewerage in Makati&#13;
city.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
105                             ANNEX 10&#13;
of P3,000 per square meter, the projected increase in total Poblacion land value is&#13;
approximately P1,500 million -- more than double the cost of the Poblacion subproject.&#13;
This conservative assessment suggests that the increase in social value attributable to the&#13;
project will be far greater than its cost.7 It is not surprising to find, therefore, that&#13;
potential land value increases played a critical role in City Council decisions to&#13;
participate in the project in all four cities.&#13;
IV. Conclusions of the Economic Evaluation of the Project&#13;
23.   This project has been planned in close consultation with political leaders and&#13;
public managers in each city. Discussions have focused on basic issues in environmental&#13;
economics, including identification of principal pollution sources, damage estimation,&#13;
and the costs of alternatives for remediation. The experience of participatory design (see&#13;
Annex 13) has highlighted the difficulty in Davao, as in the other four cities, of securing&#13;
readily-available data to support a rigorous economic appraisal for this project. The&#13;
project team had to search hard for relevant information, which was often quite crude.&#13;
Although quantification of benefits with this information proved insufficient, it was very&#13;
useful for guiding decisions on cost-effective siting of project components. Furthermore,&#13;
conservative projections of land value increases suggest that the total social value&#13;
generated by the project will easily exceed its cost.&#13;
24.   This finding is equally valid for Cagayan de Oro. In fact, it should derive greater&#13;
health and recreational benefits because current levels of sewage contamination in&#13;
Cagayan de Oro are considerably worse than in Davao city. In the other two project cities&#13;
(Cotabato, Calamba), additional benefits from the protection of ecologically-fragile&#13;
wetlands are clearly important but difficult to quantify.&#13;
25.   An important additional factor has been the national policy of decentralization.&#13;
This has thrown up interesting new ways by which benefits and costs get evaluated in&#13;
practice. Instead of a project team's computations of net benefits from the project, local&#13;
groups and organizations perforce make these assessments. There is no project unless&#13;
City Councils and participating barangays agree that the investment is worth the costs.&#13;
Participatory assessment of benefits and costs is the final arbiter on whether to undertake&#13;
the project at all.&#13;
26.   The most significant factor that has turned stakeholders into active participants is&#13;
the hard budget constraint facing LGU administrations. Their funds come from local&#13;
taxes and services, or from transparent transfers from the national Government.&#13;
Additional resources can only come from voluntary contributions. This budgetary&#13;
constraint forces locally-elected officials to make hard choices between sewerage and&#13;
other socially-valuable investments such as schools, health centers, roads, etc.&#13;
7Property value increases internalize privately appropriated benefits on-site, and not community benefits&#13;
created off-site. The health and recreational benefits discussed refer to the latter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
106                         ANNEX 10&#13;
27.   The project's approach has been to utilize the GOP decentralization strategy to&#13;
plan and implement the sewerage, sanitation and drainage investments. The starting point&#13;
was to ascertain household preferences and willingness to pay. In each of the cities&#13;
surveys were undertaken to determine what types of sanitation services households&#13;
wanted, and how much they were willing to pay for these. Next, the project verified&#13;
preferences at the neighborhood or purok level in three barangays of Davao city to&#13;
determine how communities viewed the potential benefits and costs from the project.&#13;
Finally, the preferences of Mayors, City Councilors and LGU professional staff were&#13;
elicited.&#13;
28.   The conclusion drawn from these studies was that two significant factors had to&#13;
be considered.&#13;
29.   First, a City Council Resolution to participate in the project provided a good&#13;
signal about whether the City considered the project worthwhile despite significant&#13;
opportunity costs. The Resolution also signaled the elected body's willingness to devote&#13;
a substantial part of available budgetary resources to sewerage at a time when the next&#13;
election is only eighteen months away. The project team made presentations to each City&#13;
Council in November and December 1996 on the project concept, design, costs, benefits&#13;
and implementation arrangements. Acceptance of the project by the City Council&#13;
signified a clear perception of the project's net benefits to the local community.&#13;
30.   Second, identification and measurement of the environmental and health benefits&#13;
of sewerage investments provide, at best, a weak proxy for full valuation of benefits.&#13;
This is because many benefits are extremely difficult to quantify in monetary or physical&#13;
terms. At best, quantitative analysis of benefits, costs and survey-based measures of&#13;
willingness-to-pay can provide benchmarks for decisions which affect people's health&#13;
and the quality of their lives. Collaborative preparation of this project with LGU officials&#13;
and households has highlighted the significance of locally-appropriable benefits. In&#13;
project discussions, city officials and community leaders pointed repeatedly to the&#13;
prospect of increases in land values in sewered areas, which would reflect improvements&#13;
in the neighborhood environment, new possibilities for high-rise construction, and the&#13;
protection of nearby beaches. They were also attracted by the prospect of more general&#13;
benefits not captured by CBD property values, including health, recreational and aesthetic&#13;
improvements from reduced contamination in areas of the city outside the CBD.&#13;
31.  In conclusion, for demand-driven projects, formal assessment of benefits and&#13;
costs is necessary, but not sufficient: in all four cities, quantified assessments based on&#13;
crude data have expanded LGU stakeholders' view of project possibilities. In several&#13;
cases, these assessments have motivated significant changes in project design. However,&#13;
they have not been the determining factor in project choice. Elected community leaders&#13;
have opted for sewerage projects because they perceive that the economic and social&#13;
benefits justify the costs. In the decision process, they have taken account of increased&#13;
land values in central Davao city, as well as improvements in the quality of life in other&#13;
areas of the city.&#13;

PHILIPPINES&#13;
WATER DISTRICTS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
The Community Participation Process in WDDP&#13;
I. Basic Assumption&#13;
1.   In defining the methodology for the WDDP community participation process the&#13;
basic assumption was that the success of social programs lies in the interaction between&#13;
the agents that promote such programs and their users. This is the only way of ensuring&#13;
that sewerage and sanitation investments lead to sustainable services in the long run. The&#13;
agents include the IBRD, the PMO/LBP, state and/or municipal governments,&#13;
consultants, and contractors. The users are the communities and groups that will benefit&#13;
directly from the program.&#13;
2.   In the proposed interactive process, the agents that promote the programs must&#13;
listen to the community, learn about its actual conditions, and implement projects that&#13;
respond to the users preferences with regard to tariffs and service levels. The user&#13;
community needs to be responsible for ensuring it is a fully equal participant in the&#13;
planning and operation of facilities constructed.&#13;
H. Methodology Used&#13;
3.    WDDP takes a participative approach based on an active and continuous process&#13;
of interaction between the beneficiaries and all the production agents involved, with a&#13;
view to obtaining a common understanding of rights and responsibilities.&#13;
4.    The following steps will be undertaken during the process:&#13;
(a)   Information dissemination takes place at all stages of a project, implying a&#13;
continuous feedback process through which the community learns about&#13;
potential activities in the area, and the agents to learn about community&#13;
dynamics.&#13;
(b)   Discussion between the technical team and user groups will result in better&#13;
comprehension of the issues. Working with this element in all stages of a&#13;
project means integrating "popular wisdom" with "technical know-how".&#13;
In other words, the agents and communities engage in an on-going&#13;
discussion of the community situation and dynamics and technically&#13;
viable activities.&#13;
(c)   Proposal and decision. This is the next stage in the process, and enables&#13;
the project staff and the communities to reach closure on the final project&#13;
design best suited to the community needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
124                       ANNEX 13&#13;
(d)   Responsibility: This is the final objective of the participative process, in&#13;
which the project team and the public make a commitment, with the&#13;
former undertaking to provide sanitation systems that are suited to the&#13;
community's preferences and willingness to pay. The users' commitment&#13;
to pay for the service, use the systems carefully, and pay for the&#13;
maintenance of the equipment is guaranteed by community groups at the&#13;
block, purok or barangay levels.&#13;
III. Stages of Work&#13;
5.    Methodologically, the community participation process is divided into stages&#13;
coinciding with the stages of the project cycle, although some of the stages can be carried&#13;
out concurrently.&#13;
6.    Stage One. Description of the Area. This stage precedes the works and&#13;
constitutes the first contact with the community. It involves identification of formal and&#13;
informal community representatives and leaders for negotiations, leading to formal&#13;
agreements for performance of the work. In this stage, the community is informed about&#13;
the work. Use is made of community resources, vehicle-mounted loudspeakers,&#13;
newspapers, community radio programs, religious organizations, etc. wherever feasible.&#13;
7.    A socioeconomic study is also conducted in this stage, and provides baseline&#13;
socioeconomic and physical data: the site (only topography, location of housing, lots,&#13;
etc.), the socioeconomic level of the inhabitants (income composition, employment,&#13;
schooling, etc.), the sanitation and health situation (solutions used for water, sewage, and&#13;
trash, health condition, most frequent diseases), identification of community resources&#13;
(schools, health posts, businesses, etc.) and the different entities that are active in the area&#13;
(public and private, goveniment and non-governmental), and the level of community&#13;
organization (associations, types of activities).&#13;
8.    This stage ends with the mobilization of the community to discuss possible&#13;
interventions in water supply and sanitation.&#13;
9.    Stage Two. Definition of the Productive Process. Under WDDP, no project is&#13;
carried out unless the community gives its support. In Stage Two the public although not&#13;
yet organized already has begun showing some interest in the program. The project&#13;
design consultant team facilitates extensive discussions among the potential beneficiaries&#13;
and LGU staff on possible technical alternatives for the project. This stage provides&#13;
concrete information on how the project will be implemented, and discusses the&#13;
technically viable options available.&#13;
10.   Usually the community is divided into sectors, blocks, condominial areas, etc., for&#13;
the presentation of the projects and technical alternatives, since discussion in smaller&#13;
groups facilitates presentation and understanding. The meetings are conducted by teams&#13;
of sociologists and engineers, with the former being responsible for mobilization and&#13;
observation of community dynamics, and the latter for the technical proposal. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
125                       ANNEX 13&#13;
project Consultant team will also undertake random household visits to mobilize the&#13;
public and ensure that the information has been properly understood.&#13;
11.   This stage ends when the community formally commits itself to the project and&#13;
decides on the technically-viable alternative that is best suited to its needs and financial&#13;
possibilities. An acceptable level of commitment would be when at least 60 percent of&#13;
the community sign-on to the project proposals.&#13;
12.   Commitment to the project may be individual (signature of the terms of&#13;
agreement) or in well-organized communities it may be agreed to by purok or barangay-&#13;
level groups (i.e. minutes of meetings signed by the participants). Local NGOs active in&#13;
an area must also be involved in this process.&#13;
13.   The first two stages are estimated to take an average of between two to four&#13;
months.&#13;
14.   Stage Three. Implementation of the construction works. The works are executed&#13;
in this phase. It includes actions to promote, maintain, and consolidate the community&#13;
participation process. With a view to strengthening community organization, committees&#13;
of community members will be encouraged to monitor the work, and agents will be&#13;
trained to disseminate information throughout the community.&#13;
15.  Informal groups already active in the community (for example neighborhood&#13;
women's groups), could be trained as project disseminators. Similarly, parents'&#13;
association of local schools could take on the responsibility of monitoring the works.&#13;
16.   At this stage, sanitary and environmental education activities by other national&#13;
and LGU-based programs will be coordinated with the project activities. Sanitary and&#13;
environmental education messages can be reinforced through the use of simple texts&#13;
(which could frequently be prepared by the community itself), and through educational,&#13;
cultural, and recreational activities, such as sports events, street theater, essay and poster&#13;
contests, etc. Participants will also be encouraged to undertake income-producing&#13;
activities such as craft fairs, production cooperatives, etc.&#13;
17.   As for execution of the works begun in this stage, local labor will be used&#13;
whenever possible, contracted by the construction companies or in the form of voluntary&#13;
labor or self-construction groups.&#13;
18.   This stage ends with the completion of the works.&#13;
19.   Stage Four. Operation of the Systems. The sanitation systems becomes&#13;
operational when the facilities are completed. Community training in the proper use and&#13;
maintenance of the systems is stepped-up in this stage. Training for the disseminators&#13;
will also be stepped up, so they can continue the work of sanitary education after the&#13;
WDDP team has left.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
126                       ANNEX 13&#13;
20.   For about three months after the systems become operational, the Design and&#13;
supervision team will remain in the area, reinforcing hygiene education and ensuring that&#13;
communities are fulfilling their agreed responsibilities.&#13;
21.   Different informal groups and voluntary organizations (church groups, mother&#13;
associations, soccer clubs, youth groups etc.) active in the area will be involved at this&#13;
stage because they are the ones who can give continuity to the community participation&#13;
process, and ensure that the results obtained under WDDP get fully internalized within&#13;
communities.&#13;
22.  Initially a follow-up study was planned in order to identify the changes that took&#13;
place in the projects. However, on review, the project preparation team felt that to&#13;
perform a second study three months after the systems become operational is inadequate&#13;
time for evaluating the sustainability of investments.&#13;
23.   Stage Five. Evaluation. This is not a separate stage. It takes place on two levels&#13;
during the entire process (as discussed in Annex 8) and involves:&#13;
24.   Public evaluation of project performance with the help of the multi-disciplinary&#13;
project team; identifying difficulties, suggesting solutions, and examining results.&#13;
25.   Technical evaluation of the project team evaluates the procedures followed, and&#13;
verifies whether the construction activities are in consonance with community wishes.&#13;
IV. Role of the Consultants&#13;
26.   Under WDDP, the LGU and Water District staff will be responsible for ensuring&#13;
that community participation actually takes place. The actual community participation&#13;
will be conducted during the detailed engineering design process by the Design and&#13;
Supervision Consultant. The LGUs and WDs do not have the institutional capacity to&#13;
undertake such a complex process. The Design and Supervision Consultant's terms of&#13;
reference spell out the detailed requirements(see Annex 12).&#13;
27.   All community participation projects will be executed by a team consisting of&#13;
civil engineers, community participation specialists (with local knowledge of the area)&#13;
and LGU representatives. The task of mobilizing a suitable team is the responsibility of&#13;

            Philippines - Water Districts Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Water Districts
            Development Project are to: 1) help participating local
            governments and water districts plan and implement sewerage
            and sanitation investments; and 2) assist the Phillippine
            government in developing transparent regulatory mechanisms
            in order to facilitate private sector participation in water
            utilities. The project consists of two components, financed
            by two loans. The first loan will finance the Public
            Performance Audit (PPA component), comprising technical
            assistance designed to pilot and field-test a privatized
            public performance audit system. Independent auditors will
            monitor, evaluate, and publicly report the performance of
            the two consessionaires who have been awarded the contracts
            to manage metro Manila's water supply and sanitation
            infrastructure. The second loan will finance the Sewerage,
            Sanitation, and Drainage component (the SSD component),
            consisting of constructing sewerage, sanitation, and
            drainage infrastructure in the cities of Davao, Cotabato,
            Calamba, and Cagayan de Oro.
