STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
Credit and Project Summary&#13;
BORROWER:                          Republic of Albania.&#13;
Beneficiary:                       General Roads Directorate,&#13;
Ministry of Construction and Tourism.&#13;
Credit Amount:                     SDR 10.1 Million (US$15.00 million equivalent).&#13;
Terms:                             Standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity.&#13;
Poverty Category:                  Program of Targeted Intervention (para. 3.01)&#13;
Project Objectives and Description:   The main objectives of the project are: (a) to promote&#13;
agricultural development by rehabilitating and&#13;
maintaining rural roads serving agricultural areas and&#13;
to improve access, economic and social services for&#13;
rural population centers; (b) to establish the&#13;
institutional  and  financial  arrangements  for&#13;
administering and maintaining rural roads on a&#13;
sustainable basis; (c) to reduce poverty and increase&#13;
employment by carrying out project works with labor&#13;
intensive methods; and (d) to encourage the&#13;
development of the domestic contracting and&#13;
consulting industries.&#13;
The project includes: (a) improvement of 975 km of&#13;
rural roads by contractors using labor intensive&#13;
methods (US$24.40 million, excluding contingencies);&#13;
(b) provision of office and transport equipment&#13;
(US$0.85 million); (c) operational costs (US$0.33&#13;
million); (d) supervision of works (US$1.00 million);&#13;
(e) technical assistance (TA) (US$0.30 million), a&#13;
project coordinator (US$0.40 million), and training&#13;
(US$0.20 million) to implement the project; and (f)&#13;
an Organization and Management Study (US$0.30&#13;
million), including an inventory of the 9,500-km rural&#13;
road network and an analysis and definition of the&#13;
best  institutional,  managerial,  and  financial&#13;
arrangements for its administration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-ii-&#13;
Benefits and Risks:                The GOA has expressed strong interest in the project,&#13;
which is expected to play an important role in the&#13;
consolidation of a free-market based rural transport&#13;
sector. The main project benefits include savings in&#13;
vehicle operating costs and road maintenance costs.&#13;
Unquantifiable benefits include increased development&#13;
of agriculture where lack of access has choked&#13;
agricultural output, generation of employment,&#13;
promotion of domestic contracting, institutional&#13;
improvements in road maintenance, better rural&#13;
services, and environmental improvement consisting&#13;
mainly, but not only, of the reduction of soil erosion.&#13;
The project is estimated to have an ERR of about 33&#13;
percent.&#13;
The main project risks are: (a) GOA does not provide&#13;
sufficient funds to maintain the project roads; (b)&#13;
GOA fails to implement the necessary institutional&#13;
reforms to administer and maintain the rural road&#13;
network; and (c) labor intensive road works are&#13;
complex. However, GOA has set its budget for&#13;
maintaining the main road network above the levels&#13;
agreed under the ongoing Transport Project, and will&#13;
be asked to agree at negotiations to provide sufficient&#13;
funds to maintain the project roads; this would reduce&#13;
risk under (a). GOA's recent adoption of legislation&#13;
on local government reform, and the establishment of&#13;
a task force to address remaining issues would&#13;
significantly reduce risk (b). Risk (c) would be&#13;
minimized by employing consultants experienced in&#13;
labor intensive works. Project risks are considered to&#13;
be acceptable with these arrangements. There is a&#13;
country risk, the threat of a Balkan war, which cannot&#13;
be assessed.&#13;

I. ECONOMY AND SECTOR&#13;
A. Economy&#13;
1.01    Economic Developments. Since the presentation of the last Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS), Albania has continued to emerge from the deep social and economic crisis that&#13;
accompanied the collapse of communism in 1990-92. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew&#13;
more than 10 percent in 1993 and 7 percent in 1994, and inflation declined from a peak&#13;
annualized rate of 30 percent in mid-1993 to less than 16 percent in 1994. The macroeconomic&#13;
program supported by the IMF and the World Bank remains on track. Substantial remittances&#13;
from abroad, coupled with the income created by the newly-emerging private sector, fueled an&#13;
extraordinary expansion in demand and associated standard of living for Large segments of the&#13;
population.&#13;
1.02    The very strength of the economic recovery has, however, aggravated the severe&#13;
infrastructure bottlenecks which were noted by the CAS to be a major impediment to private&#13;
sector development. Bottlenecks are particularly prevalent in transport, electricity distribution,&#13;
water supply and sewage and housing. An example of the problem was the electricity crisis&#13;
of December 1994, where frequent power outages disrupted economic activity and created&#13;
difficult living conditions. Investment flows averaging close to 20 percent of GDP would be&#13;
required to rebuild infrastructure and maintain an adequate public investment. The required&#13;
level of investment could not be provided under the constraints of the adjustment program during&#13;
1993 and 1994, although an important step forward has been achieved with a substantial increase&#13;
in public investment in the 1995 budget. The priority given to infrastructure in the 1994 CAS&#13;
thus remains fully valid, with emphasis on providing investment capital aid helping to improve&#13;
the institutional capacity and market-oriented policy framework. The next three projects that we&#13;
plan to present to the Board are in the infrastructure sector, including the present project, a&#13;
Power Transmission and Distribution Project, and a Second Transport Project. Overall&#13;
performance of the IDA portfolio has been good. Cumulative IDA disbursements have, so far,&#13;
been 50 percent ahead of worldwide IDA averages, and the development impact of the portfolio&#13;
has met the desired objectives. With one exception, new IDA projects have taken less than three&#13;
months on average to become effective. To further strengthen portfolio ownership and&#13;
management, a series of annual Country Portfolio Performance Reviews were started in October&#13;
1994.&#13;
1.03    Agriculture. Agriculture (a principal project beneficiary) accounts for about 50 percent&#13;
of GDP. Albania has made extraordinary progress in reforming the sector. Nearly all&#13;
cooperative land and state farms have been distributed, creating over 400,000 smallholder farms.&#13;
Together with the liberalization of all producer, wholesale and consumer prices, this reform has&#13;
resulted in an increase of agricultural output of about 20 percent in 1993. However, the&#13;
cropping pattern remains oriented toward satisfying family needs as the newly established private&#13;
farmers seek to protect their food security, with little agricultural surplus being marketed to date.&#13;
Further reforms are required in the areas of pricing policy, the system of rural credit and land&#13;
policy. Inadequate infrastructure is also a serious obstacle to the further development of the&#13;
agricultural sector, particularly irrigation facilities and rural roads.  Most rural roads in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
agricultural areas are now in such poor condition due to lack of maintenance that an estimated&#13;
400 villages and numerous settlements inhabited by a total of nearly one million people are&#13;
inaccessible to motorized vehicle during at least part of the year, as discussed further in Chapter&#13;
II.&#13;
1.04    Government Decentralization.  In most countries, the responsibility for the&#13;
construction and maintenance of rural roads is assigned to local government, since most of the&#13;
benefits are local. Albania has taken the first steps to establish and fund local government&#13;
authorities. The draft constitution provides for three hierarchical layers: (a) central government;&#13;
(b) 36 district governments (the intermediate layer); and (c) numerous local communes and&#13;
municipalities. Parliament passed the Law on the Organization and Functioning of Local&#13;
Government and the Law of Prefectures, both in 1992, which more or less has established the&#13;
three layers of government. The Government has established an Intergovernmental Task Force&#13;
on Decentralization to address remaining issues. In particular, they are seeking: (a) to clearly&#13;
delineate expenditure assignments, obligations and authorities among various levels of&#13;
government; (b) to maintain central quality control in key sectors; and (c) to review the&#13;
implications of centralized pricing policies on local government, develop a local government&#13;
financing plan, and define the assets which are being transferred to local government. While&#13;
some aspects of this process require a country-wide approach, others can be handled on a&#13;
sectorial basis, including the technical and administrative arrangements for maintaining rural&#13;
roads. To further this process, the project includes a study on organizing the maintenance and&#13;
administration of rural roads, as described in Chapter Ill.&#13;
1.05    Unemployment and Poverty. The low level of salaries under central planning was&#13;
partially compensated for by good overall access to health, education and other social services,&#13;
and the quasi absence of open unemployment. With the chaos that followed the transition of&#13;
1991-92, access to social services deteriorated, and pockets of extreme poverty have emerged,&#13;
especially in remote rural areas. The project is expected to have a significant impact on poverty&#13;
because it will be carried out with labor intensive methods in rural areas with a high&#13;
concentration of poor people. The Project has been classified as a "Program of Targeted&#13;
Intervention' because of its expected impact on unemployment and poverty, as discussed in&#13;
Chapter m.&#13;
B. The Transport Sector&#13;
1.06    System. The transport system is based on: (a) a road network of about 18,000 km,&#13;
which is described in Chapter II; (b) a rail network of 447 km of single track main lines plus&#13;
273 km of other lines; (c) the main port of Durres with 2,563 m of quays, and secondary ports&#13;
of Vlora, Saranda and Shengjini; (d) inland navigation on the Drinit River; (e) a national&#13;
shipping fleet of 31 vessels totaling 85,000 dead weight tons, and (f) an international airport at&#13;
Tirana with a 2,700 m runway. The transport system is generally adequate in extent, but its&#13;
condition has deteriorated to the point where it is significant constraint on the development of&#13;
a market economy.&#13;

1.07   Sector Transformation.  Transport demand and supply were both highly distorted&#13;
under the previous regime. Like other Eastern European countries, Albania was transport&#13;
intensive due in part to the emphasis on mining and heavy industries and to the subsidization of&#13;
transport services. The Government required that most goods be carried by the railway, and&#13;
goods were moved to or from the railhead by a fleet of small, publicly owned trucks. Private&#13;
automobiles were prohibited, as were transport businesses run by the private sector. The&#13;
Government invested only around US$30 million per annum (p.a.) in the transport and&#13;
communications sectors during 1986-90. Although the previous regime emphasized the railways&#13;
and showcase investments, in practice many projects were not completed, construction standards&#13;
were low, transport infrastructure was not maintained, and equipment was not replaced when&#13;
it was worn out. The Government has since increased investments as indicated in Table 1.1&#13;
below.&#13;

1.08   The GOA has also taken a number of steps since 1991 to establish market-based&#13;
policies in the transport sector. The Ministry of Industry, Transport and Trade (MOT) has&#13;
privatized most of its truck and interurban bus fleet, and removed most land transport&#13;
regulations. The GOA has postponed several large investments which appeared uneconomic, and&#13;
is using available funds to catch up with the maintenance and rehabilitation of existing&#13;
infrastructure. The GOA also increased road fuel taxes as discussed in Chapter II, and initiated&#13;
a program to improve road safety. The Port of Durres is taking steps to establish itself as an&#13;
autonomous port and is preparing a port masterplan under the ongoing Transport project. The&#13;
goal is to improve port operations, and to operate on a self-financing basis. MOT is further&#13;
defining its role in a market-based economy, assisted by project consultants and other advisors.&#13;
However, much further work remains to be done; for instance, the institutional, organizational&#13;
and technical arrangements for administering and maintaining rural roads must be established.&#13;
This is a principal objective of the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
1.09   Market reforms have had a significant effect on transport demand. Uneconomic mines&#13;
and heavy industries have closed, significantly reducing the demand for rail transport.&#13;
Agriculture and small scale commercial activities have grown. Freight volumes are much&#13;
smaller and quality requirements higher for these activities, favoring road transport. The&#13;
transport sector has been essentially deregulated, private automobiles and transport businesses&#13;
are now permitted, and transport subsidies have been reduced. As a consequence of these&#13;
changes and the economic slowdown, railway freight traffic has declined to about one-tenth of&#13;
the level of the late 1980s. Recent trends for rail and water traffic are as follows (statistics are&#13;
no longer available on road traffic due to privatization):&#13;

1.10    Road traffic has grown rapidly; the number of passenger cars has increased more than&#13;
25-fold from a low base, and the number of trucks has increased three-fold between 1990 and&#13;
1994. (See Table 1.3).&#13;

Albania now has 18 passenger cars per 1,000 population, which is much lower than other&#13;
Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries (e.g. 70 in Rumania, 147 in Bulgaria, 169 in&#13;
Poland), but roughly consistent with ownership rates in other low and lower-middle income&#13;
countries (e.g., 15 in Thailand; 19 each in Bolivia, Egypt, and the Philippines; 32 in Ecuador).&#13;
Future car ownership patterns are expected to more nearly approximate those of other CEE&#13;
countries because of Albania's location in Europe, the large supply of inexpensive used vehicles&#13;
in adjacent countries, and the expected rapid development of the economy from a low base. In&#13;
order to catch up, the car fleet will need to grow at more than double the rate of GNP for at&#13;
least the next several years. This kind of growth has been observed in other parts of the world&#13;
in earlier years. The Bank forecasts that Albania's GNP will grow 6 percent per year from 1994&#13;
to 1997.&#13;
C. Previous IDA Involvement in the Transport Sector&#13;
1.11    As an immediate response to critical needs, port materials and spare parts, 20 urban&#13;
buses, and a small amount of railway communications equipment were included in IDA's first&#13;
loan to Albania, the Critical Imports Project (Credit 2404-ALB) in 1992. A loan of US$18&#13;
million to the transport sector was subsequently made by IDA in October 1993, together with&#13;
the Kuwait Fund and other donors (Credit 2499-ALB). This ongoing Transport Project seeks&#13;
to address two important issues: accommodating the increase in road traffic, and determining&#13;
the future role of railways. It is IDA's first credit to the transport sector in Albania. The&#13;
project includes the improvement of 84 km of main roads, the provision of equipment for the&#13;
Tirana road maintenance district, the repair of quays and port surfaces and the provision of&#13;
equipment for the port of Durres, technical assistance (TA) to improve the market orientation&#13;
of the sector and implement the project, a study and follow-up program to improve road safety,&#13;
and a study to determine the future role of Albanian Railways. The civil works and equipment&#13;
for the port of Durres are being cofinanced by the Kuwait Fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
1.12    Project implementation is generally satisfactory. Implementation was delayed for a&#13;
short time by the transfer of the General Roads Directorate (GRD, formerly the National Roads&#13;
Directorate) from the Ministry of Industry, Transport and Trade (MOT, formerly the Ministry&#13;
of Transport and Communications) to the Ministry of Construction and Tourism (MOC, formerly&#13;
the Ministry of Construction, Housing and Territorial Adjustment). The project has already&#13;
achieved results in terms of increasing the road maintenance budget, establishing local/foreign&#13;
joint ventures to strengthen the domestic contracting industry, introducing competitive bidding&#13;
procedures for the procurement of works and equipment, and expediting the privatization of&#13;
MOT truck and bus companies. The main lessons learned are the importance of keeping the&#13;
project objectives and design straightforward, and providing technical assistance through&#13;
experienced outside advisors that is within the absorptive capacity of the borrower.&#13;
D. Future Planning in the Transport Sector&#13;
1.13        Government plans for future investments in the transport sector are generally&#13;
reasonable in light of the difficult issues involved. The rate of investment will depend on the&#13;
availability of funds, although the size of the road problem, including rural roads, far outstrips&#13;
investments made to date, as well as the Government's future financial possibilities. In the roads&#13;
sector, the principal ongoing or reasonably firm projects include road rehabilitation works and&#13;
purchase of maintenance equipment under the ongoing Transport Project, additional maintenance&#13;
equipment and buses, a bus administration building for Tirana, and the proposed Rural Roads&#13;
Project. The GOA also plans to rehabilitate the Miloti-Yugoslavia (Montenegro) border road.&#13;
A decision on the extent and timing of this part of the project will depend on the outcome of&#13;
feasibility studies and on the extent of the rehabilitation of the Tirana - Durres - Rrogozhina&#13;
railway line. This decision, in turn, depends on the outcome of the railway study (para 1.11).&#13;
Road investments are discussed further in Chapter II.&#13;
1.14        Port investments include the rehabilitation works and equipment purchased under&#13;
the Transport Project, possible construction of a grain silo (which should probably now be&#13;
postponed due to a recent decline in grain traffic), and a ferry terminal to accommodate roll on -&#13;
roll off traffic, which is growing rapidly. The GOA also plans to improve the main airport at&#13;
Tirana, where an investment of about US$15 - 20 million is strongly justified on traffic and&#13;
safety grounds.&#13;
HI. ROADS&#13;
A. Network and Traffic&#13;
2.01    There are approximately 18,000 km of roads in Albania. Of these, 2,400 km are&#13;
classified as primary and 5,000 km as secondary roads, while 9,500 km are unclassified tertiary&#13;
or local (rural) roads. There are also some 1,000 km of urban streets (Annex 2.1). About 90&#13;
percent of the primary and 15 percent of the secondary roads are paved. There are a few fully&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
engineered gravel roads, but most of the rural roads have a robust but uncomfortable stone-&#13;
pitched road base, or are seasonal tracks. The condition of the network varies. The primary&#13;
roads are generally in a poor but stable condition, but design standards are outdated, construction&#13;
practices are poor, and the roads have not been well maintained, particularly during the last&#13;
several years. The secondary and tertiary networks have, for some years, been almost totally&#13;
neglected. Many of these roads are passable only to four wheel drive vehicles during the dry&#13;
season. It is estimated that there are around 400 villages and numerous settlements in Albania&#13;
with a combined population of nearly one million people that are inaccessible to four-wheel drive&#13;
vehicles during at least part of the year (para. 1.02). The basic structures of these roads are&#13;
modest but usable. Drainage varies widely; in some places it requires only the addition of a few&#13;
culverts, while in others it needs to be fully reconstructed.&#13;
2.02    The network was designed to carry a small fleet of state owned vehicles, in an era&#13;
when there were severe restrictions on personal mobility. The number of registered vehicles has&#13;
grown some six-fold during the last four years and is expected to continue growing rapidly&#13;
(para. 1.10). Traffic is heaviest on the main roads linking Tirana to Durres, and Durres to the&#13;
South (as far as Vlora), with traffic levels ranging from 5,000 to as much as 11,000 vpd.&#13;
Traffic on the main road from Tirana to the North now ranges between 2,000 to 4,000 vpd,&#13;
while traffic on the main road between Tirana and the East (FYR Macedonia) ranged from 1,000&#13;
to 2,500 vpd. Traffic counts carried out by project consultants on 40 representative sections of&#13;
secondary and tertiary roads in the project ranged from 60 vpd to a high of 1,670 vpd (excluding&#13;
agricultural and animal drawn traffic). Advisors under the Transport Project are assisting GRD&#13;
to establish a regular system of traffic counting. Truck sizes have increased from a typical&#13;
weight of five tons per single axle to ten tons per single axle on the asphalted roads (often, 11.5&#13;
tons as presently authorized in the European Community), and six tons on the rest of the&#13;
network. Significant numbers of heavy articulated trucks are now in use, and these are even&#13;
appearing on tertiary roads. There are no axle-load limitations at present, and this issue is being&#13;
investigated with the assistance of advisors under the Transport Project. As a consequence,&#13;
almost all of the paved roads need to be rehabilitated, investments are required to increase&#13;
capacity on some sections of primary roads, and sections of the secondary and tertiary networks&#13;
require improvement.&#13;
B. Administration and Organization&#13;
2.03    Administration of the road system is divided between the "national" road network of&#13;
7,400 km, 1,000 km of "municipal" roads, and the remaining 9,500 km of "local" roads. As&#13;
of December 1994, the primary and secondary roads of the "national" system are administered&#13;
by the Ministry of Construction and Tourism (MOC) through the General Roads Directorate&#13;
(GRD) in Tirana. GRD was under the responsibility of the Ministry of Industry, Transport and&#13;
Trade (MOT) until December 1993. While final administrative arrangements are still being&#13;
refined, GRD has been placed under the Minister of MOC in a similar way to various institutes&#13;
which have their own budgets, as shown in Chart 1. Consultants financed under the Transport&#13;
Project are presently assisting MOC to further define the responsibilities and organization of&#13;
GRD, with a view to establishing a westem style road administration (in the past, GRD&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
concentrated primarily on preparing and monitoring multi-year road expenditure plans). GRD's&#13;
administration and accounting systems were reviewed and found satisfactory to process&#13;
statements of expenditure (SOEs).&#13;
2.04    GRD's field organization currently consists of 28 District Road Directorates (DRDs),&#13;
corresponding to the 28 former administrative districts in the country. The nation's districts&#13;
were recently redrawn, so that today there are 36 administrative districts in Albania. GRD&#13;
appoints DRD's managers and approves their budget. Road maintenance activities are&#13;
undertaken by the DRDs with a high degree of autonomy. Each DRD has a workshop for&#13;
regular repairs and maintenance of equipment, but major overhauls are performed at the central&#13;
workshop in Tirana. DRDs are divided into three to five executive units, called crews. Each&#13;
crew is directed by an engineer or technician, and is responsible for all routine and winter&#13;
maintenance. The organizational structure for a typical district is shown in Chart 2. The DRDs&#13;
employed 5,405 persons as of January 1995, including 36 engineers, 327 technicians (often&#13;
performing engineer's functions), 70 administrative staff, and 4,972 laborers. The work force,&#13;
all Albanian, is competent in traditional engineering disciplines. However, Albania was isolated&#13;
for more than 40 years, and road personnel require training in modem approaches to&#13;
management, economics, and recent technological developments. Financing for this type of&#13;
assistance is being provided under the Transport Project.&#13;
2.05    According to the Law No. 7572 on Local Government of June 10, 1992, the remainder&#13;
of the road network is the responsibility of the 36 local elected legislative bodies called the&#13;
district councils, with the possibility left open for them to delegate further to a commune or&#13;
baskia (town) council. Although the legal responsibility for this lowest level of the road system&#13;
is clear, the system is not yet implemented. Most of these local roads used to be maintained&#13;
by large state farms or cooperatives until they were dissolved. Neither the districts nor the&#13;
communes have a budget adequate to meet their responsibilities at present. In addition, they have&#13;
insufficient technical capacity and, in matters related to roads, it appears common for the&#13;
commune or baskia to approach the DRD for informal technical advice. The Ministry of Local&#13;
Government plans to provide the district councils with more realistic budgets for road&#13;
maintenance and to arrange with individual communes for local sources of taxation to finance&#13;
local road maintenance beginning in 1995, as discussed below.&#13;
C. Construction and Maintenance&#13;
2.06    New road construction, rehabilitation and upgrading are presently carried out by a&#13;
variety of organizations. SmaU and medium works are managed by DRD. The construction&#13;
works for the new Tirana - Vora highway are directly administered by a special cell created&#13;
within the MOC. Under the Transport Project, rehabilitation works on five road sections are&#13;
administered by GRD, with project coordination provided by a Project Implementation Unit&#13;
(PIU) within the MOT. The Irrigation Rehabilitation Project under the Ministry of Agriculture,&#13;
the Rural Poverty Alleviation Project, and the proposed Rural Development Project, as well as&#13;
various private bodies, are also financing a small amount of tertiary road improvements. IDA&#13;
funds are being channeled through the Albania Development Fund operating under the direction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
of a multi-ministerial Steering Committee. The involvement of so many organizations in road&#13;
construction is a byproduct of the economic transition. In response to this situation, GRD is&#13;
investigating the re-organization of the roads sector with the assistance of consultants financed&#13;
under the Transport Project. This study will be complemented by a study on the organization&#13;
and management of rural roads under the proposed project, as discussed in Chapter m.&#13;
2.07    Prior to 1991, construction was done exclusively by three autonomous state-owned&#13;
enterprises, the National Road Asphalting Enterprise under the jurisdiction of the MOT, and the&#13;
National Bridge Construction Enterprise, and the Highway and Road Construction Enterprise&#13;
under the jurisdiction of the MOC. The Asphalting Enterprise has now formed a joint venture&#13;
with an experienced foreign construction firm. These state enterprises are facing a significantly&#13;
decreased work load and are being privatized. A small-scale private sector construction industry&#13;
is developing that has acquired some limited experience in management and contracting skills,&#13;
mostly in private building construction. While company experience in road construction in the&#13;
emerging private sector is limited, many of their key staff have extensive experience in road&#13;
works from their former employment. In addition, a significant number of Albanians have&#13;
practical construction experience from working in other countries. Domestic contractors would&#13;
be assisted in improving their skills under the project, as discussed in Chapter III.&#13;
2.08   International competitive bidding for road works has been introduced and is already&#13;
being applied under the Transport Project. In order to be eligible for road works in Albania,&#13;
contractors have to register with MOC. The contractor's technical director is required to be an&#13;
engineer with experience in road works. Under the Transport Project, over 60 companies applied&#13;
and 41 were prequalified, including state companies in joint ventures with foreign companies.&#13;
It appears that the financial, technical, and managerial capacity of more than 20 of these&#13;
companies would be sufficient to execute significant improvement contracts, i.e., 20 - 50 km,&#13;
under the project and smaller contractors could compete either by forming joint ventures or by&#13;
bidding on smaller sized contracts.&#13;
2.09    The DRDs execute all the maintenance works on the national road network.&#13;
Maintenance works are undertaken by a crew which is responsible for 30 to 50 km of road. The&#13;
crews' headmen have long experience and are skilled in the definition and supervision of road&#13;
maintenance that has been, up until now, labor intensive. The DRD's maintenance equipment,&#13;
e.g., trucks, compactors, asphalt mixing plants, is mostly very old and largely unusable, and the&#13;
ongoing Transport Project is financing equipment for the Tirana DRD. Additional maintenance&#13;
equipment for other DRDs will be financed under the proposed Rural Roads Project. Private&#13;
contractors appear to be bringing in road maintenance equipment as required. There is little&#13;
other maintenance equipment available in Albania.&#13;
2.10    While many of GRD's roads are continuously maintained, the quality of the works is&#13;
not always satisfactory and the work efficiency is low, mainly due to lack of equipment (e.g.,&#13;
for compacting) or proper supervision. Bituminous roads are repaired with asphalt concrete,&#13;
penetration macadam, or low quality natural bituminous sand. Major repairs are done using&#13;
asphalt concrete prepared at a central asphalt batching plant, but not many plants are in working&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
order. Bituminous sand is frequently used to fill pot-holes, but compaction is left to the traffic,&#13;
which is unsatisfactory. Repair of gravel roads is done sometimes with river gravel but mainly&#13;
with crushed gravel, which often is transported over long distances. Grading is generally done&#13;
manually, and compaction is left to the traffic. A significant problem arises because of the&#13;
standard design of stone-pitched roads. Poor bonding between the stone base and the gravel&#13;
surface results in the gravel being quickly lost, especially when placed without compacting. This&#13;
problem would be addressed during the Rural Roads Project with the assistance of advisors.&#13;
GRD intends to give most periodic maintenance and some routine maintenance work to private&#13;
contractors, and is being assisted under the Transport Project to accomplish this task.&#13;
D. Planning and Supervision&#13;
2.11    The MOC, through GRD, is responsible for planning the main road network, subject&#13;
to approval by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and Parliament. GRD prepares all engineering&#13;
design work with the collaboration of the Institute for Studies and Projects No. 2 (see Chart 1).&#13;
Recently, engineering and economics staff have been leaving the government to become private&#13;
engineering consultants in competition with government institutes. Road designs have to date&#13;
followed those applied in Italy, and are appropriate to forecast traffic flows and physical&#13;
characteristics.&#13;
2.12    Road works were formerly supervised by the state enterprise which implemented them.&#13;
There are currently eight engineering companies registered with GRD to provide design and&#13;
supervision services. Of these eight companies, seven are small independent consultants,&#13;
consisting of one to two engineers and employing additional staff for specific projects; the&#13;
"Institute No. 2" is presently in the process of becoming privatized. Three laboratories currently&#13;
provide laboratory services, the Institute for Construction Technology, mainly for construction&#13;
materials, the Hydro-geotechnical Institute for earthworks and road base materials, and the&#13;
Technical University for a limited number of tests. It is anticipated that supervision consultants&#13;
required under the Rural Roads Project would form a foreign/local joint venture, which would&#13;
assist in developing the local consulting industry in Albania, as discussed in Chapter III.&#13;
E. Expenditures and Financing&#13;
2.13    Road expenditures averaged about US$10 million equivalent per year, during the 1980s&#13;
based on the official exchange rate, which must be interpreted with caution because of distortions&#13;
in the economy and statistics. About 70 percent of this amount was spent on GRD roads and&#13;
30 percent on the rest of the network. Around US$ 6.5 million of the total amount was spent&#13;
on maintenance with the objective of keeping the roads passable at minimum possible cost.&#13;
Maintenance expenditures fell in the late 1980s and early 1990s due to budgetary constraints,&#13;
reaching a low of US$3.5 million equivalent in 1992. The GOA then increased its maintenance&#13;
budget for GRD roads above the level agreed under the Transport Project. The 1994&#13;
maintenance budget is about US$ 8.0 million equivalent, or about US$ 1,100 per kilometer.&#13;
This would be sufficient to maintain GRD roads if the road network and GRD equipment were&#13;
in good condition, which they are not. Investments are required to catch up with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
maintenance backlog and to replace old equipment, which is being supported under the&#13;
Transport Project and proposed project.&#13;
2.14    Almost all of GRD's paved road network (about 2,800 km, Annex 2.1) is in bad to fair&#13;
condition (para. 2.01). Rehabilitation of almost all of these roads is likely to be economically&#13;
justified, considering that most of these roads carry more than 2,000 vehicles per day, there is&#13;
a rapid growth trend for traffic (para. 1.10), and axle loads have recently increased (para. 2.02).&#13;
However, this would require an investment of some US$280 million to carry out&#13;
(US$ 100,000/km). In addition, some of the paved roads require investments to increase capacity&#13;
(town bypasses, climbing lanes, possibly some four-lane construction), local roads need to be&#13;
improved, and all roads need to be maintained. Many other countries spend around one percent&#13;
of GNP on their road networks, with some spending as much as two percent. Considering&#13;
Albania's needs, the Government needs to find a way to spend around US$25 million each year.&#13;
(about 2.2 percent of 1993 GNP) on their paved road network. This would permit them to carry&#13;
out one cycle of rehabilitation on their paved roads in about 16 years, and to budget US$ 8.0&#13;
million per year for road maintenance. This appears to be beyond the GOA's budgetary&#13;
possibilities. Most funds would, therefore, need to be provided on concessional terms by the&#13;
international financing institutions (IFIs). The Bank intends to raise this issue with the IFIs, and&#13;
to consider the preparation of further road projects.&#13;
2.15    Road expenditures are funded from the budget. Road fuel was subsidized until 1992.&#13;
Category 2 gasoline (supposedly 70 octane, but more typically 55 octane at that time) sold for&#13;
about US$ 0.18 equivalent per liter and diesel fuel sold for about US$ 0.12 per liter. The GOA&#13;
then increased the quality and price of category 2 gasoline to US$0.70/1 equivalent in 1994,&#13;
including a real tax element of about US$0.51/1, and raised the price of diesel fuel to US$0.41&#13;
equivalent per liter, including a real tax element of about US$0.23 per liter, exceeding the&#13;
amounts agreed under the Transport Project'. The GOA does not presently collect other&#13;
significant taxes from road users except vehicle import duties and license fees. MOT is&#13;
investigating the establishment of a comprehensive system of road user charges with the&#13;
assistance of advisors financed under the Transport Project. The GOA would be asked to agree&#13;
at negotiations to allocate funds to maintain rural roads improved under the project, as discussed&#13;
in Chapter mI.&#13;
2.16    The procedure for approving and using national road funds begins with requests that&#13;
are prepared by the planning section of the DRD, and then sent by the DRD to GRD for&#13;
approval. GRD assembles and vets these requests, and submits a combined road budget for&#13;
approval through MOC and MOF to Parliament. Following adoption of the Government budget,&#13;
MOF sends funds for most DRDs to the District Authority Bank and the funds are then&#13;
withdrawn by the DRD and used to pay the cost of salaries, materials, and general operations.&#13;
The District Authority Bank is used for historical reasons, and this system is subject to review&#13;
during the ongoing banking system reforms. In the case of local roads, baskias and communes&#13;
it  real tax element defined as the retail price less border price and distribution costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
presently receive a small amount of money through the Ministry of Local Government (since&#13;
December 1994 incorporated into the Ministry of Internal Affairs), which is under review as&#13;
discussed (para. 1.04). The GOA agreed at negotiations to provide sufficient funds and instruct&#13;
GRD  to maintain project roads, and to carry out  a study and implement agreed&#13;
recommendations on administering and financing all non-GRD roads under the project, as&#13;
discussed in Chapter Im.&#13;
F. Road Transport&#13;
2.17    Under the previous regime, MOT and other Government agencies operated almost all&#13;
road vehicles. The GOA then embarked on a privatization program, coordinated by the National&#13;
Agency for Privatization. More than two-thirds of Albania's vehicle fleet is now privately&#13;
owned. MOT is now close to completing the privatization of its former fleet of around 6,000&#13;
vehicles, using a variety of methods. Those which remain operate essentially as private&#13;
companies since MOT no longer provides them with any financial support. MOT is working&#13;
to overcome the remaining problems such as valuation of assets, requirement to retain all&#13;
personnel, lack of knowledge of marketing and business practices with the assistance of advisors&#13;
provided by the Netherlands, and under the Transport Project. Other ministries also operated&#13;
truck and bus fleets, which were formerly dedicated to organizations belonging to these&#13;
ministries, and can be considered as own account transport. Many of the large enterprises to&#13;
which these fleets belong are now closed, and the vehicles are in poor condition. A large&#13;
number of trucks and buses have also been imported by the private sector since 1990, mostly&#13;
used vehicles of western manufacture. There is now sufficient truck capacity in Albania to&#13;
transport the nation's agricultural inputs and outputs on the rural roads to be improved under the&#13;
project.&#13;
2.18    Traffic accidents are becoming an increasingly serious problem, paralleling the rapid&#13;
growth of the vehicle fleet. There were 317 highway fatalities during the first ten months of&#13;
1993 compared to 145 in all of 1990 (updated statistics not yet available from GRD). This gives&#13;
Albania by far the highest road accident rate in Europe, e.g. about 20 times the death rate per&#13;
vehicle-kilometer as in Italy. Reducing accident rates requires a multi-disciplinary effort,&#13;
including identifying and correcting unsafe places on the roads (black spots), introducing and&#13;
enforcing a vehicle inspection system, preventing drunk driving, improving the enforcement of&#13;
traffic regulations, improving access to medical help, and education and publicity campaigns.&#13;
MOT and GRD are working, in collaboration with the police, on the identification of black&#13;
spots, and on channelizing non-motorized traffic and agricultural tractors on the main roads.&#13;
An advisor financed under the Transport Project is assisting MOT and other Ministries to define&#13;
and implement a program to improve road safety.&#13;
G. Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.19    The GOA has long recognized the importance of environmental issues, passing&#13;
numerous laws and regulations during the last four decades. However, little has been done in&#13;
practice, so that rivers, lakes, the Adriatic Sea at river outlets, and air at specific locations are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
highly polluted. The main sources of pollution are mining (erosion and water pollution), heavy&#13;
and light industry (water and air pollution), energy (air pollution) and urban areas (sewage).&#13;
Air pollution caused by vehicle emissions is not yet a major issue, although this may become&#13;
a problem in the future as the fleet continues to expand. The MOT advisors financed under the&#13;
Transport Project are making preliminary recommendations concerning vehicle emission&#13;
standards and other environmental matters. Steps are also being taken to mitigate any adverse&#13;
impact from rural road construction under this project, as discussed in Chapter Im.&#13;
HI. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
3.01    The Rural Roads Project supports the Country Assistance Strategy for Albania&#13;
(reviewed by the Board on March 8, 1994) by rehabilitating public infrastructure that has fallen&#13;
into such state of disrepair that it is a major impediment to the development of the local private&#13;
sector as well as to foreign direct investment, and by supporting the agricultural sector in which&#13;
Albania has comparative advantage. The main objectives of the project are to:&#13;
(a) promote agricultural development by rehabilitating and maintaining rural roads&#13;
serving agricultural areas, and improve access, economic and social services for&#13;
rural population centers;&#13;
(b) establish the institutional and financial arrangements for administering and&#13;
maintaining rural roads on a sustainable basis;&#13;
(c)  reduce poverty and increase employment by carrying out project works with labor&#13;
intensive methods; and&#13;
(d) encourage the development of the domestic contracting and consulting industries.&#13;
The project directly serves an agricultural area of around 150,000 ha with a total of about&#13;
425,000 people (19 percent of the rural population of Albania) as discussed in Chapter IV. It&#13;
will provide 12,000 man years of work over three years in 20 districts containing 60 percent&#13;
(about 168,000) of the nation's unemployment and will create 500 permanent jobs for the&#13;
maintenance of its assets. Consequently with these potential achievements, the project has been&#13;
rated as "Poverty Category: Program of Targeted Intervention" in accordance with the provisions&#13;
of O.D. 4.15, a classification exclusively reserved for projects with strictly direct and strong&#13;
impact on the alleviation of poverty.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
3.02    The main thrust of the 1996 - 1998 National Rural Roads Development Program is to&#13;
selectively rehabilitate and improve the rural road network, and to establish a satisfactory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
maintenance management system. The Rural (Feeder) Roads Study2, financed by the Swiss&#13;
Government with IDA as Executing Agency, has identified a three-year (1996-1998) time slice&#13;
(44 months including eight months before 1996 for preparation and mobilization of sub-projects)&#13;
in which all sub-projects, subject to confirmation and possible amendment before implementation&#13;
takes place, meet agreed selection criteria. The project components are:&#13;
(a)  improvement of around 975 km of rural roads by contractors using labor intensive&#13;
methods (US$24.40 million, excluding contingencies);&#13;
(b) provision of office and transport equipment (US$0.85 million);&#13;
(c)  operational costs (US$0.33 million);&#13;
(d)  supervision of works by an international team of consulting engineers (US$1.00&#13;
million);&#13;
(e)  technical assistance (TA) (US$0.30 million), Project Coordinator (US$0.40&#13;
million), and training (US$0.20million) to implement the project; and&#13;
(f)  an Organization and Management study (US$0.30 million), including an inventory&#13;
of the 9,500-km rural road network and an analysis and definition of the best&#13;
institutional, managerial, and financial arrangements for its administration.&#13;
Project roads have been selected on the basis of their potential for increasing agricultural output,&#13;
improving access to rural population centers, and reducing unemployment with the advice and&#13;
contribution of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Labor, and the Ministry of&#13;
Transport, as discussed in Chapter IV.&#13;
3.03   Improvement of Roads (975 kIn, US$24.40 Million). Eighty five project roads&#13;
(Annex 3.1, Nos. 1 through 85) have been selected in fourteen districts (Map IBRD 26231) from&#13;
two agricultural regions, the Adriatic coastal plane north (Map IBRD 26232) and south (Map&#13;
IBRD 26233) the city port of Durres (Durres, Tirana, Kruja, Laci, Lezha, Shkodra, Kavaja,&#13;
Peqini, Lushnja, Fieri and Vlora districts), and the southeastern region (Map IBRD 26234)&#13;
around the city of Korca (Korca, Pogradeci and Devolli districts). Five additional economically&#13;
justified roads (Annex 3.1, Nos. 86 through 90) have been included in six additional (Topoje,&#13;
Hasi, Gramshi, Berati, Skrapar and Saranda) districts (Map IBRD 26725) at the request of GOA.&#13;
They are located in areas where poverty, poor access, and lack of alternative investment&#13;
possibilities are chronic. All works permitting substitution of equipment for labor, would be&#13;
carried out through labor intensive methods, unless otherwise agreed by IDA. This was agreed&#13;
at negotiations (para. 5.01(a)). On the few road construction activities less suitable to labor&#13;
intensive methods, e.g., compaction of soils and long materials haulages, the use of equipment&#13;
will be kept to the minimum to guarantee satisfactory results.&#13;
3.04    The roads will be improved according to road, structures, and soil condition, and to&#13;
the anticipated volume of traffic. The expected traffic volumes in the year 2000 of over 250,&#13;
between 250 and 100, and less than 100 vehicles per day (vpd) have been used to define the road&#13;
2/ in its draft Final Report of July 1994 and Supplementary Report of December 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
width (between 6.50 and 5.0m), the carriageway width (between 5.0 and 3.50m), and the type&#13;
of surfacing, i.e., penetration macadam (PM) for more than 250 vpd and gravel for the other&#13;
roads as detailed in Annex 3.2. Short road sections in high rainfall areas with steep gradients&#13;
as well as within towns, will be provided with PM surfaces in order to avoid rapid deterioration.&#13;
These paved sections will be observed in order to compare performance, durability and&#13;
maintenance requirements with gravel sections in the same conditions, in order to judge cost&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
3.05    Forty percent of the 975 km of roads will be improved with a gravel wearing course,&#13;
and 60 percent will be paved, with the surface type selected on the basis of economic criteria&#13;
as discussed in Chapter IV. Rehabilitated roads usually require regravelling every five years.&#13;
In the past, regravelling requirements were not met due to deficient (or non-existent)&#13;
maintenance management, and financial constraints (para. 2.01). Once the network of improved&#13;
rural roads expands, the backlog of regraveling needs will increase, also leading to more&#13;
deterioration of rehabilitated roads. Therefore, an expansion in rehabilitation can be justified&#13;
only if the follow up regravelling requirements can be met. To reverse the present trend, the&#13;
project will provide funds for routine maintenance equipment (para. 3.06). GOA will provide&#13;
sufficient funds, estimated at US$375 per km/year as an absolute minimum for the routine&#13;
maintenance of the 975 km. These funds can be provided mainly as part of the revenues&#13;
obtained from the fuel tax (para. 2.15). All routine maintenance activities will be carried out&#13;
through the length-man system of contracting. Grass cutting, cleaning of culverts and ditches,&#13;
patching, and care of edge-planted trees, will be the responsibility of a single man contractor for&#13;
every two km of road on average. The single man contractor will receive direct help from the&#13;
respective District Road Directorate for periodic regravelling and for asphalt tasks related to the&#13;
PM surfaced roads, and in other cases, when required.&#13;
3.06    Office and Transport equipment (US$0.85 Million). For a project involving many&#13;
dispersed construction sites (90 road sections) and many organizations, adequate transport&#13;
facilities and office equipment for efficient project management and monitoring are essential.&#13;
Presently, this is not available either in Government institutions or in private sector offices.&#13;
Equipment provided for the GDR will include computers and office equipment to allow proper&#13;
monitoring and reporting, and supervision vehicles. The DRDs will require computers and other&#13;
equipment to allow proper accounting and monitoring of construction activities and the&#13;
simultaneous build-up of a road data bank for maintenance, and also will need vehicles (pick-ups&#13;
and motorbikes) for supervision of construction works as well as maintenance. The international&#13;
and the local consultants will need equipment for construction supervision and technical&#13;
assistance including vehicles and motorbikes for supervision, and basic drafting, surveying and&#13;
measurement equipment for construction design and supervision. Furthermore, all project&#13;
offices should be equipped with basic furniture and communications facilities. Details of&#13;
equipment items to be provided and cost estimates are shown in Annex 3.3.&#13;
3.07    Operational costs (US$0.33 Million). Due to very restricted budgets provided by the&#13;
Government of Albania for operational expenses, the project will also contribute to the following&#13;
costs: (a) incremental office operational expenses of the Project Implementation Unit (para.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
3.24); and (b) all DRDs' expenses that are additional to the normal running costs, i.e.,&#13;
international communications, office consumable related to the office equipment provided, and&#13;
the operational expenses of supervision vehicles and motorbikes (Annex 3.4).&#13;
3.08    Supervision of Works (US$1.00 M;llion).  Given that the project will involve the&#13;
employment of a number of relatively inexperienced contractors, proper supervision will play&#13;
an important role in ensuring that works meet targeted deadlines and are fulfilled according to&#13;
planned cost and quality parameters, while at the same time following prescribed labor-intensive&#13;
construction methods. Neither local contractors nor GRD/DRDs have the experienced personnel&#13;
required. Under these circumstances, an international consulting firm will need to be hired in&#13;
order to provide a team of independent engineering supervisors with extensive road building&#13;
experience for design and supervision of works. This team should include a Resident Team&#13;
Leader (25 man/months) and a Chief Resident Engineer (38 man/months). The Terms of&#13;
Reference (TOR) are outlined in Annex 3.5. In total, about 40 contract packages during the&#13;
period 1996-1998, scattered across 20 districts, will have to be supervised. Success will require&#13;
a strong organizational force. The main tasks of the team will include:&#13;
*   define contract packages&#13;
*   review prequalification and tender documents&#13;
*   advise on evaluating prequalifications, tenders, and on contract negotiations&#13;
*   review designs (and confirm traffic) of roads to be improved&#13;
*   prepare construction drawings with the contractors&#13;
*   supervise construction works (together with the contractors), including quality&#13;
control, cost control, measurement, and progress control&#13;
*   assist contractors in preparing bills and certifications of bills&#13;
*   report to the DRDs, and to the PIU within the GRD&#13;
Hiring of the international consultant team of supervisory engineers should be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness of the Credit (para. 5.04).&#13;
3.09    The international consultants are expected to associate with and lead local engineers,&#13;
so that the project will contribute to the development of local consultants by a step wise&#13;
procedure: during the first phase, local engineers will be engaged as individuals for about a year,&#13;
receiving training and support in design, supervision, contract management, and management&#13;
of a small company, and during the second phase, they will be engaged as local private&#13;
independent consulting firms under the leadership of the international consultants. A different&#13;
group of local engineers will be made responsible for each of the following three groups of&#13;
districts (altogether comprising 230 man/months): (a) Tirana and northern regions (Tirana,&#13;
Kruja, Laci, Lezha, and Shkodra, Map IBRD 26232); (b) southern regions (Durres, Kavaja,&#13;
Lushnja, Pequini, Fier, and Vlora, Map IBRD 26233); and (c) southeastern regions (Korca,&#13;
Pogradeci, and Devolli, Map IBRD 26234) and five additional roads (para. 3.03 and Map IBRD&#13;
26725). The local consultants will be responsible for day to day supervision of all construction&#13;
works. This will include making all necessary adaptations of the designs to local site conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
3.10 Technical Assistance and Training (TA) (US$0.90 Million). TA and training are&#13;
required by the employers (GRD and DRDs), the contractors oocal contractors), and the&#13;
engineers (local consulting and individual engineers). In order to assure success, several&#13;
additional tasks should be provided by the team of international consultants. These tasks,&#13;
defined and detailed in their Terms of Reference (Annex 3.5) are to assist:&#13;
* GRD in project management, including development of necessary planning,&#13;
monitoring, and management tools&#13;
* DRDs in management of contracts, accounting, and assumption of the role of the&#13;
Employer&#13;
* DRDs in designing and implementing a maintenance concept, and management&#13;
system&#13;
* local contractors in methods of on site organization, management of labor and&#13;
equipment, measurement, and billing&#13;
* local consultants in supervision, contract management, and company management&#13;
(administration, cost calculation and control, quality assurance).&#13;
3.11    The TA described above would require specific training courses as follows: (a) for&#13;
GRD -- on the management of contracts (FIDIC), and training in the use of computer facilities,&#13;
followed by study tours to western Europe (3 - 10 day tours of 6 persons); (b) for the DRDs --&#13;
management of contracts (FIDIC), road maintenance management, accounting and use of&#13;
computer facilities; (c) for local contractors -- seminars on bidding procedures and&#13;
documentation, use of labor-intensive construction methods, measurement and billing in&#13;
contracts, and equipment management; and (d) for the local engineering consultants -- training&#13;
in supervision of contracts (measurement and billing, control of cost,quality, and progress) and&#13;
in the best ways to build up and manage independent consulting offices. The above TA and&#13;
subsequent training will require 13 man/months from the resident international supervisory&#13;
consultant team. In addition, 16 man/months of assistance will be provided by short term&#13;
specialists who will provide assistance in accounting, special aspects of contracting (e.g. use of&#13;
FIDIC for claims), site assistance for contractors, formation and management of consulting&#13;
companies, road maintenance management, and technical matters (pavement technology, erosion&#13;
protection, small structures, etc.). Details of this training and related estimated costs are&#13;
provided in Annex 3.6.&#13;
3.12   The project also requires a Project Coordinator (para. 3.25). The position will cover&#13;
44 months of the project, and will commence 8 months before the physical start of the project&#13;
to allow timely preparation of works. The Project Coordinator will be supported by professional&#13;
and supporting staff, and will receive advice and support from the specialists of other&#13;
departments within GRD and from the international (supervision) consultants. The TOR for this&#13;
position are included in Annex 3.7. The appointment of the Project Coordinator, a condition&#13;
of Board presentation, was approved on May 1, 1995 (para. 3.25 and para. 5.03).&#13;
3.13    Organization and Management Study (US$0.30 M;llion).  GRD is the only&#13;
organization capable of managing and maintaining project roads until permanent administrative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
and financial arrangements are established. The 36 new Administrative Districts have been&#13;
made legally responsible for the approximately 9,500 km of roads which are not administered&#13;
by GRD, excluding urban streets and roads directly administered by forestry or industrial&#13;
enterprises, but lack funds and technical expertise to do the work (para. 2.05).&#13;
3.14    The purpose of the Organization and Management Study will be to identify and&#13;
inventory the non-GRD road network, and to analyze, recommend and prepare to implement the&#13;
most appropriate system for assuring its administration, financing and maintenance. The study&#13;
will determine whether the best solution is to decentralize responsibilities to the communes or&#13;
an association of communes (decentralized solution), or centralize responsibility under GRD,&#13;
e.g., through a sub-directorate for rural roads (centralized solution). Other possibilities include&#13;
a mixture of GRD and main commune responsibilities, or to have GRD only intervene in the&#13;
most difficult tasks and provide technical assistance to the communes.  The Study&#13;
(30man/months) will: (a) identify the non-GRD road network; (b) review existing arrangements&#13;
for managing non-GRD roads; (c) assess the capacity of GRD to administer additional roads;&#13;
(d) assess the capacity of the Districts and representative Communes for maintaining non-GRD&#13;
roads; (e) review the role of central Government for funding the maintenance of non-GRD roads;&#13;
(f) assess the availability of local contracting capacity; (g) recommend the most cost effective&#13;
means of maintaining the non-GRD network; (h) develop structures, job classifications, staffing&#13;
requirements and the levels of authority for the DRDs and/or other responsible organizations;&#13;
(i) determine training and interim institutional requirements; (j) inventory the non-GRD road&#13;
network; (k) define work methods, prepare an indicative work program and determine budgetary&#13;
requirements and financing sources for each responsible organization; (1) review legal&#13;
instruments and propose necessary changes; and (m) prepare a practical implementation plan for&#13;
review and decision by Govemment. The TOR for the Organization and Management Study are&#13;
provided in Annex 3.8. The Government agreed at negotiations to complete an action plan not&#13;
later than July 31, 1997, and to carry out such a plan to improve the administration and&#13;
maintenance of non-GRD roads, including implementing the recommendations of the&#13;
Organizational Management Study as agreed with IDA.&#13;
C. Relation to Other Projects in the Sector&#13;
3.15    Other World Bank Group projects with road sector components are also operating in&#13;
Albania, namely: (a) the Rural Poverty Alleviation project (RPAP); (b) the Irrigation&#13;
Rehabilitation project (IRP); and (c) the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)&#13;
projects. The RPAP and IFAD projects have objectives more directed to immediate social&#13;
support and their roads programs are operating on smaU tertiary Oocal) roads within communes,&#13;
presently in areas not covered by the Rural Roads Project. Therefore, no requirement of direct&#13;
coordination or cooperation will arise in those cases. The IRP, effective since November 1994,&#13;
is financing some access roads for machinery and equipment to irrigation works. Since these&#13;
roads carry almost no other traffic, special coordination with the Rural Roads Project is not&#13;
required.&#13;
&#13;

D. Cost Estimates&#13;
3.16    The estimated total cost of the project, including taxes and physical and price&#13;
contingencies amounts to US$33.6 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of&#13;
about US$7.91 million equivalent or 24 percent of total project cost. The costs of the different&#13;
project components are detailed in their specific paragraphs (paras. 3.02 through 3.13, and 3.18)&#13;
and subsequent Annexes. A summary of these project components and cost estimates is given&#13;

3.17   Construction cost estimates are based on quantities from engineering designs already&#13;
prepared by consultants and estimated at December 1994 unit costs. The foreign component is&#13;
estimated from a breakdown of cost elements. The local costs include taxes and duties estimated&#13;
at about 5 percent of total costs. Costs of equipment and vehicles (exempt from import taxes&#13;
and duties) and their operational costs, are based on the latest acquisitions under the Critical&#13;
Imports Project (Credit 2404-ALB), the ongoing Transport Project, and on similar deliveries in&#13;
the region.&#13;
3.18    Supervision of works requiring 63 man/month from international consultant team at&#13;
about US$10,000 m/rn and 230m/m from local consultants at about US$2,000 equivalent per&#13;
m/m, amounts to about 4 percent of the construction cost, a reasonable amount in works with&#13;
such a complex management organization. Costs for the 29m/m for technical assistance, 40m/m&#13;
for project coordinator, and 30m/m for the Organization and Management Study are based on&#13;
an average of US$10,000 per m/m. These costs are in line with those of similar ongoing&#13;
operations in neighboring countries, and with those of the ongoing Transport Project. Costs for&#13;
training in the GRD and DRDs (50 m/m) and for training local contractors and consultants (50&#13;
m/m) are estimated at US$2,000 per m/m, taling into account that most activities would consist&#13;
of in-house training and that the most expensive item in international training, traveling, would&#13;
mostly take place inside Europe and would be relatively inexpensive. The technical assistance,&#13;
training, and O&amp;M study costs are exempt from taxes and duties.&#13;
3.19    A physical contingency of 10 percent has been included for all components to cover&#13;
possible increases in quantities. This amount is appropriate given the simple but quite precise&#13;
primary engineering designs available for the road works. Price contingencies have been applied&#13;
to base costs, expressed in US$ in accordance with Bank Guidelines for each year 1995 through&#13;
1998, as follows: 2.0, 2.5, 2.7, and 2.5 percent.&#13;
E. Project Financing&#13;
3.20    The Borrower would be the Republic of Albania. The IDA would provide a credit of&#13;
US$15.00 million equivalent (44.5 percent of total project cost), and the Government of Italy&#13;
a Lira 24.80 billion or US$15.0 million equivalent (44.5 percent of total project cost) untied&#13;
loan. The GOA will contribute, exclusively in local costs, US$3.60 million equivalent or 11&#13;
percent of the total project cost, i.e., the US$1.20 million annual amount which is all that it can&#13;
afford to budget under current economic conditions. During negotiations, the Government&#13;
confirmed that it will meet these local costs (para. 5.01(g)). A proposed financing plan, based&#13;
on the above assumptions, and confirmed with the Government at negotiations (para. 5.01(h))&#13;
is shown in Table 3.2 below.&#13;

3.21    In addition, GOA is expected to contribute US$2.75 million equivalent over the five-&#13;
year period 1997 to 2001 from budget allocations for financing of routine maintenance activities&#13;
on the 975 km. of roads covered by the Rural Roads Project. During negotiations, assurances&#13;
were obtained from GOA that sufficient budgetary allocations would be made to GRD for the&#13;
maintenance of rural roads in its budget in line with the agreed upon schedule for the 1997-2001&#13;
period, namely the equivalent of US$450,000 in fiscal year 1997, US$500,000 in FY1998,&#13;
US$550,000 in FY1999, US$600,000 in FY2000 and US$650,000 in FY2001 (para. 5.01(i)).&#13;
F. Project Design, Organization and Implementation&#13;
3.22    Design.  Road designs have traditionally been for very low  levels of traffic,&#13;
construction practices of poor quality, and maintenance inadequate, as discussed in Chapter II.&#13;
The design approach for all project roads investigated has been to make maximum use of the&#13;
existing structures and to propose well known construction methods which require a minimum&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
of equipment, and a maximum of local labor and local materials. This approach reduces&#13;
technical risks during improvement. However, the outline design will require detail adaptation&#13;
during construction, hence the importance of selecting competent teams for project coordination&#13;
and supervision.&#13;
3.23    Organization. Based on the present organizational set-up of the Albanian road&#13;
administration, the implementation of the project will be organized through the GRD and its&#13;
DRDs under the MOC. GRD will be responsible for all central functions of the project and&#13;
DRDs for the execution of works within their respective districts (Annex 3.9 GRD and Project&#13;
Organization). The Organization and Management Study (para. 3.13 above) will advise on the&#13;
future organization and responsibilities for the whole rural road network, i.e., the fact that the&#13;
districts and communes should have a budget appropriate to fulfill their responsibilities, and how&#13;
their technical capacity should be established or provided by GRD.&#13;
3.24   Implementation Approach and Schedule. The proposed IDA credit of US$15.00&#13;
million equivalent, and the Italian loan of Lira 24.80 billion or US$15.00 million equivalent,&#13;
will be made to the GOA. The GRD will be responsible for the overall implementation of the&#13;
project through a five-member Project Implementation Unit (PIU) established in GRD under&#13;
the chairmanship of H.E. the Ministry of Construction. The members of the PIU will include&#13;
the aforementioned Chairman, GRD's Director General, a representative of the Ministry of&#13;
Economy and Finance, MOF, and representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry&#13;
of Labor. All project policy issues will be discussed and, in principle, decided by the PIU&#13;
Board. Establishment and staffing of the PIU, a condition of negotiations, took place through&#13;
MOC's Ministerial Order No. 648 of March 3, 1995 (para. 5.02).&#13;
3.25    The PIU would be assisted in its day-to-day implementation work by an operations&#13;
Secretariat in the GRD Foreign Aid Department including a Secretariat Chief (Engineer),&#13;
Secretary (Economist), and an Accountant, all from GRD's staff. An important fourth member&#13;
of and advisor to the Secretariat would be the Project Coordinator, an expatriate contract&#13;
management specialist who, along with the other members of the Secretariat, would be supported&#13;
by GRD specialists from other departments and by the international consultants. The Project&#13;
Coordinator will work and report on a day-to-day basis within the Secretariat but will be&#13;
eventually responsible before PIU's Chairman, the GRD's Director General. The main tasks&#13;
of the Project Coordinator and the PIU Secretariat would be:&#13;
* project coordination, liaison to the Government, IDA, consultants and DRDs&#13;
* planning of works and budgeting&#13;
* resource allocation&#13;
* selection, negotiation/award of contract to the international consultant team and&#13;
assistance to the consultants in administrative matters&#13;
* finalization of prequalification and tender documents&#13;
* issue of guidelines for prequalification and tendering to the DRDs&#13;
* preparing overall project accounts&#13;
* monitoring of progress, quality and financial performance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
* reporting (quarterly) to the Government and IDA&#13;
* technical services to DRDs&#13;
The PIU's Secretariat Chief will be deeply involved in the 8-month preparation phase (para.&#13;
3.29) of the project. Its establishment and staffing, a condition of negotiations, took place on&#13;
March 3, 1995 through MOC's Ministerial Order No. 648 (para. 5.02). The appointment of the&#13;
Project Coordinator, a condition of Board presentation, was approved on May 1, 1995 (para.&#13;
5.03).&#13;
3.26    The project will be implemented at the district level through the DRDs. DRD&#13;
involvement is essential because they have experience in road works and labor-intensive&#13;
maintenance in their respective districts, and because the project roads are or will be part of the&#13;
network that they maintain in the future. The works will be executed with the DRDs as&#13;
"Employer", the private contractors as "Contractor", and the international consultants in&#13;
collaboration with local consultants as "Engineer". The tasks of the DRDs will include:&#13;
* project implementation at the district level&#13;
* prequalification of contractors&#13;
* tendering, tender evaluation and award of contracts&#13;
* approval of changes in construction matters (alterations of design/quantities,&#13;
extension of time, termination, etc.)&#13;
* inspection of operations, materials and works&#13;
* contract payments to contractors as certified by the Engineer&#13;
* monitoring of progress and actions of the Engineer&#13;
* accounting of project expenses&#13;
* reporting on progress and finances to the Project Coordinator&#13;
3.27    The road works component will start with a one-year pilot phase at reduced targets of&#13;
160-km (already selected, in principle) on fifteen roads in five districts (Durresi, Fieri, Lushnja,&#13;
Laci, and Tirana) (Annex 3.10, Road Improvement Program - Year 1 Defined Roads) followed&#13;
by a GOA/IDA review and evaluation towards the end of the first year, and not later than March&#13;
31, 1997. The review and evaluation shall be done on the basis of the results obtained in the&#13;
following project aspects: (a) prequalification and bidding procedures; (b) performance of GRD,&#13;
DRDs, and consultants; (c) progress and quality of works; and (d) overall evolution of project&#13;
costs. This approach will allow weaknesses in the implementation arrangements to be identified,&#13;
and experience will be gained with the organizational, managerial, and technical procedures.&#13;
Suitable modifications will be introduced in the following two years of construction, on the basis&#13;
GOAtIDA review. The list of roads to be built in the first year (1996) of the project was agreed&#13;
at negotiations (para. 5.01(k)).&#13;
3.28   Intemational consultants assisted by local consultants, under the conditions formulated&#13;
in para. 3.08, will be employed in the position of Engineer to assist GRD under terms and&#13;
conditions acceptable to IDA (TOR in Annex 3.5). Procurement of equipment and vehicles, and&#13;
TA and training will be under the direct responsibility of GRD and coordination of the PIU,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
following submission to IDA, for review and approval, of the related documents and evaluation&#13;
of the proposed experts. During negotiations (para. 5.01(1)), agreement was reached with GOA&#13;
on the TORs for: (a) Engineering supervision of road works, Annex 3.5; (b) Project&#13;
Coordinator, Annex 3.7; and (c) the Organization and Management Study, Annex 3.8.&#13;
3.29    An eight-month project inception phase will be implemented May-December 1995&#13;
before physical execution of road works starts in January 1996. It will include operational start&#13;
of the PIU with the Project Coordinator in May 1995, followed by procurement and mobilization&#13;
of the intemational engineer consultant team, procurement and delivery of office and transport&#13;
equipment, build up of local consultants, and preparation of documentation for road works&#13;
contractors prequalifications and bidding.&#13;
3.30   IDA has begun involvement in transport activity recently in Albania, which implies a&#13;
lack of transport sector implementation profiles for the country.  However, based on&#13;
achievements of similar projects and conditions in Albania and the region, it is estimated that&#13;
finalization of the prequalification and tender documents process to complete project set-up and&#13;
mobilization of road works would require a period of eight months (May-December 1995) with&#13;
intense involvement of the PIU and the project coordinator. Therefore, physical execution of&#13;
the successive (1996-98) three one-year road works programs will start in January 1996.&#13;
Acquisition and delivery of the most urgent office and transport equipment will take place within&#13;
the eight-month period, i.e., before December 31, 1995. The technical assistance and training&#13;
component will take place throughout the entire three year period in order to provide steady&#13;
advice to GRD, and DRDs, and the local contractors and consultants, and to avoid disruptions&#13;
in project implementation due to excessive staff diversion resulting from fast training. The&#13;
Organization and Management Study will be completed during the second year of project&#13;
implementation, when a good knowledge of the reality of physical execution of road&#13;
improvements and local governance involvement possibilities are already available.&#13;
3.31    The implementation schedule for project activities is shown in Annex 3.11. Credit&#13;
effectiveness is expected in early second quarter 1995, the start of project preparation and&#13;
mobilization is planned for May 1995, physical implementation will begin in January 1996, and&#13;
the project will be completed on December 31, 1998, with the proposed credit closing six&#13;
months later on June 30, 1999. DRDs will report monthly to PIU on their project activities, and&#13;
PIU will submit quarterly reports to the IDA detailing the implementation of every project&#13;
component activity on the basis of the DRDs' reports and based on the monitoring indicators&#13;
detailed in Annex 3.12 (Project Monitoring Matrix). During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached with the Government on the project implementation schedule (including, specifically,&#13;
completion of the Organization and Management Study during the second year of project&#13;
implementation), monitoring criteria, and reporting arrangements (para. 5.01(m)).&#13;

3.33   The road works contracts would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines&#13;
for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits dated May 1992, by Local Competitive&#13;
Bidding (LCB) procedures, with foreign firms allowed to participate. LCB is the most efficient&#13;
and economic way of procuring these works which by their nature (small contract value,&#13;
scattered geographically, labor intensive, local prices below international markets) are unlikely&#13;
to attract foreign competition. Contractors for contracts estimated above US$250,000 will be&#13;
prequalified, those for contracts estimated at US$250,000 and below, postqualified. Contracts&#13;
exceeding US$250,000 equivalent will be pre-reviewed by the Association. The road works&#13;
contracts will start in 1996 with a one-year pilot phase of about 160km (para. 3.27) divided into&#13;
seven contract packages in five districts, as specified in Annex 3.10. The contracts range from&#13;
Lek 2.6 million (US$26,000 equivalent) for contract 19 Kav 14 (Kavaje-Momli; 1.6 km.) road&#13;
to Lek 113.1 million (US$1,130,000 equivalent) for contract 2 Fie 21 (Varibopi-Gorishova; 34.2&#13;
km.). Bank Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of Works by LCB for contracts above&#13;
US$250,000 equivalent (documents dated July 1994), and contracts for US$250,000 equivalent&#13;
and below (documents dated June 1994) will be used. The contract packages for years 1997 and&#13;
1998 will be defined based on experience and best practices gained during the 1996 pilot phase.&#13;
It is expected that numerous local contractors, most of them proceeding from recently&#13;
commercialized and privatized state-owned companies into the private sector would be highly&#13;
competitive with their country experience, low wage costs, and new financial status. The&#13;
provision of training for GRD, DRDs and local contractors and consultants will further enhance&#13;
their experience, efficiency and competitiveness.&#13;
3.34    Equipment and vehicles for contracts estimated US$50,000 and above (Annex 3.3)&#13;
would be procured under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated May 1992.&#13;
The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of Goods by ICB, dated May 1994&#13;
will be used (estimate of seven contracts ranging from US$60,000 to US$120,000). Goods&#13;
manufactured in Albania would be granted a preference of 15 percent or related duties,&#13;
whichever is less, provided that the value added in Albania is more than 20 percent. Items of&#13;
equipment, spare parts, tools, and materials, and those for operational costs (para. 3.07),&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent each (total estimated aggregate cost of&#13;
US$300,000, Table 3.3) would be procured by Local Shopping (L.S.) with a minimum of three&#13;
quotations from three different suppliers. Proprietary spare parts (total estimated at US$300,000,&#13;
Table 3.3) would be procured directly from original suppliers. All contracts estimated to cost&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent or more, and contracts for goods procured under direct contracting, would&#13;
be subject to IDA's prior review and approval of procurement documentation. These limits&#13;
would result in prior review of contracts representing 80 percent of the credit component. The&#13;
other contracts would be subject to ex-post review after award of contract.&#13;
3.35    Consulting services, TA and Training will be carried out by qualified and experienced&#13;
consultants selected in accordance with Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August&#13;
1981). Consulting services for supervision of construction works, the Organization and&#13;
Management Study (Table 3.1, and para. 3.18), and the Project Coordinator will be carried out&#13;
by intemational consulting firms. TA and training activities will be contracted on the basis of&#13;
a selected list of qualified consulting firms and/or individual consultants (details in Annexes 3.5&#13;
and 3.6). All TORs documents related to procurement of consulting services would be subject&#13;
to prior review and approval by the Association. Consultants' contracts exceeding US$50,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
equivalent will be subject to IDA's prior review and approval. This was discussed and agreed&#13;
at negotiations (para. 5.01(n)).&#13;
3.36     A Country Procurement Assessment Report has not yet been completed. However, for&#13;
the IDA-financed portion of the project, the Borrower would follow procedures consistent with&#13;
the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. The Project Implementation Schedule (Annex 3.11, page&#13;
2) includes a procurement plan indicating major items, costs, methods of procurement, and time&#13;
schedule for all major procurement activities.&#13;
3.37     Procurement would be a main responsibility of the PIU (para. 3.25) and of its Project&#13;
Coordinator specialist financed under the project. Procurement information provided to IDA&#13;
would include: (a) prompt reporting of contract award information; (b) comprehensive&#13;
explanation of revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project; (c) revised&#13;
timing of procurement action (including advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion&#13;
time for individual contracts); and (d) compliance with aggregate limits on p-;ecified methods of&#13;
procurement. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on all&#13;
procurement arrangements (para. 5.01(o)).&#13;
H. Disbursement&#13;

3.39   Disbursements against contracts for civil works and goods, valued at less than&#13;
US$250,000 and US$50,000 respectively, would be made on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditures (SOE). During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Govemment that&#13;
documentation to support expenditures financed under SOEs would be maintained by the&#13;
Borrower and made available for review by IDA supervision missions in addition to being&#13;
audited annually by auditors acceptable to the Association (para. 5.01(p)).&#13;
3.40   Retroactive financing up to a total of US$100,000 is recommended for payments made&#13;
by the Borrower after April 30, 1995, but before the date of credit signature. This would allow&#13;
an early start on some critical items during the inception phase, such as the hiring of the Project&#13;
Coordinator for the PIU, and the acquisition of essential office equipment.&#13;
3.41    To facilitate disbursements and reduce the volume of withdrawal applications, IDA's&#13;
share of the project would be financed through a Special Account (SA; revolving fund) which&#13;
would be opened by the Borrower in the Bank of Albania. The authorized allocation for the SA&#13;
would be US$1.4 million, equivalent to about four months of project expenditures financed by&#13;
IDA during the 3 years and 8 months (44 months) disbursement period for the project.&#13;
However, unless the Association shall otherwise agree, the authorized allocation shall be limited&#13;
to US$800,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals shall be equal to or exceed the&#13;
equivalent of SDR3,000,000. Funds for equipment, vehicles, and spare parts would be&#13;
withdrawn by the Borrower from the SA after approval of the ICB, local shopping, or direct&#13;
contracting and related contract awards by the Association. Replenishment for technical&#13;
assistance and for consultants for construction supervision would be made on the basis of&#13;
appropriate documentation. Replenishment of the SA would follow IDA procedures. The SA&#13;
would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached with the Government on the establishment and operation of the SA in&#13;
accordance with the Albanian Treasury regulations, agreed with IDA, which require the&#13;
establishment of the SA in the Bank of Albania by the Treasury, the Treasury authorizing any&#13;
payment into a commercial bank account managed by the PIU upon PIU's request to pay the&#13;
expenditures under the project (para. 5.01(q)).&#13;
3.42   A schedule of disbursements, based on the Project Implementation Schedule (para.&#13;
3.30) is given in Annex 3.13. Albania is a new IDA member, with only the first activities of&#13;
the Transport Project yet under implementation. Thus, there are no sectoral disbursement&#13;
profiles available. However, the interest demonstrated by the Government and responsible&#13;
agency GRD in the project, the urgency of the need of the works, equipment and TA, and the&#13;
initial favorable disbursement under the ongoing Transport Project would guarantee a reasonable&#13;
project implementation period of 44 months. With an early second quarter 1995 credit&#13;
effectiveness date and a May 1, 1995 through December 31, 1998 project implementation period&#13;
(para. 3.30 and Annex 3. 11), the proposed credit would be fully disbursed six months later on&#13;
June 30, 1999.&#13;
I. Accounting and Auditing&#13;
3.43   Starting in May 1995, GRD would establish separate accounts through its PIU in&#13;
accordance with acceptable accounting principles, record all project expenditures and maintain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
records on commitments, reimbursements, and the status of project funds on the basis of the&#13;
accounting done and released by every DRD. With respect to the amounts withdrawn on the&#13;
basis of SOEs, GRD would maintain records on contracts, invoices, and evidence of payments&#13;
readily available for review. All records would also reflect adequately the different contributions&#13;
from the cofinanciers and the Govemment. GRD would submit to IDA a brief update of these&#13;
accounts in the quarterly reports (para. 3.31). The PIU Secretary would have the project&#13;
accounts, including SOEs, and the Special Account (para. 3.41), audited by an independent&#13;
auditor (ikely together with other IDA projects in order to achieve lower audit costs) acceptable&#13;
to IDA, and would submit annually to IDA such audit accounts within six months of the end of&#13;
each fiscal year. These requirements were agreed on with the Government at negotiations (para.&#13;
5.01(r)).&#13;
J. Envirornent&#13;
3.44    The project has been classified as "B" for purposes of O.D. 4.01 on Environmental&#13;
Assessment, meaning that only limited environmental review is required.  A thorough&#13;
environmental assessment was conducted, comprising the direct and indirect environmental&#13;
impacts of rural roads rehabilitation and maintenance operations. Annex 3.14 contains a&#13;
summary of the main results. Recommendations of the assessment, detailing the mitigation&#13;
measures to be taken, would be integrated into GRD's rural road planning design and works&#13;
execution activities during project implementation.&#13;
3.45    The project would not have significant indirect effects on the environment. Civil works&#13;
are confined to rehabilitating existing roads. This should lead to a cleaner environment for the&#13;
population living in settlements along the roads, as well as improve the delivery of social&#13;
services, i.e., health care (hospitals, dispensaries), education (schools), water supply (easier&#13;
access), fuel (delivery of gas instead of an ongoing deforestation process through the cutting of&#13;
local wood), trade (easy access to markets), and urban crossing (PM for road sections through&#13;
villages). The project would protect the areas adjacent to the roads from erosion through&#13;
construction of side-drains, cross drainage structures, and retaining walls, and planting of&#13;
vetiver. No population resettlement would be necessary since the right of way of the roads is&#13;
clear of housing construction. Furthermore, all road improvements would take place within the&#13;
public right-of-way for which the Government has full ownership. The project would not affect&#13;
any archaeological or historical site.&#13;
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A. Methodology&#13;
4.01    Economic rates of return (ERRs) and net present values (NPVs) were estimated for&#13;
the road improvements included in the project which comprise 90 percent of project costs&#13;
including contingencies. The calculations were based on a vehicle operating cost (VOC)&#13;
approach.&#13;
4.02    The project area and roads were selected to have the maximum impact on agricultural&#13;
output and to improve access to rural population centers.  Complementary irrigation&#13;
improvements will be carried out in some agricultural areas under the Irrigation Development&#13;
Project. Most project roads are in "poor" or 'bad" condition, which is a desincentive for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
farmers to commercialize their production. In addition many farmers, particularly those from&#13;
broken up state farms, are housed in apartment blocks in artificial villages which are often many&#13;
kilometers distant from the land which they are now cultivating. Complementary investments and&#13;
actions are normally required to increase agricultural output, and the absence of any significant&#13;
one of these could impede the development of the sector. This may include, in addition to road&#13;
investments, irrigation improvements, clarification of property rights, an agricultural credit&#13;
system, and suitable extension services. It is not possible to evaluate the economic benefit of&#13;
any one of these complementary inputs in isolation, although in the correct combination the&#13;
combined benefit may be significant. The main complementary investments in the agricultural&#13;
project areas have been provided under the Irrigation Development Project. However, it is not&#13;
possible to estimate the "producer's surplus" which could be separately attributed to the road&#13;
investment under this project because of its complementary nature. The VOC approach, which&#13;
was used in its place, significantly understates the importance of the project to the development&#13;
of the agriculture sector.&#13;
4.03    The project is also expected to have other benefits which are difficult to quantify. One&#13;
of the main purposes of the project is to increase employment (para. 3.01). The project, through&#13;
the increase of agricultural production and subsequent employment, and through the direct&#13;
creation of 12,000 man-years of work (road construction) over three years and 500 permanent&#13;
jobs (road maintenance) will have a significant beneficial impact on the alleviation of poverty&#13;
and on the decrease of outward migration in an area of 20 districts containing 60 percent (about&#13;
168,000) of Albania's total unemployment (para. 3.01). It will also help reduce rural poverty,&#13;
improve access to rural population areas, help with local Government reform by establishing an&#13;
administrative and financial system for maintaining all rural roads, encourage the development&#13;
of the domestic contracting industry, and help reduce soil erosion. The ERR estimates,&#13;
therefore, significantly understate the contribution of the project to Albania's economic&#13;
development.&#13;
B. Project Area&#13;
4.04    Project roads were selected in three stages. First, two project areas were identified on&#13;
the basis of their potential for increasing agricultural output. Second, project roads were chosen&#13;
within the two areas on the basis of their estimated ERRs. Third, road sections providing access&#13;
to other rural district centers were added to achieve geographic balance at GOA's request (para.&#13;
3.01). Factors considered in selecting project areas were the current volume of agricultural&#13;
production, the amount of arable land, population, unemployment, the number of persons&#13;
receiving economic assistance, and proposed complementary investments (primarily irrigation&#13;
improvements), as shown in Annex 4.1. Forestry areas were not included in the project on the&#13;
grounds that they could be more suitably improved under an integrated forestry project. Areas&#13;
where other rural road improvements are underway were mostly excluded to avoid duplication&#13;
and confusion about institutional arrangements. The highest priority area was identified as the&#13;
coastal plains, comprising the main agricultural areas in the new districts of Shkodra/Malesia&#13;
e Madhe, Lezha, Laci, Kruja, Durres, Tirana, Kavaja, Peqini/Elbasani, Lushnja,&#13;
Fieri/Mallakastra and Vlora. These districts provide about 63 percent of the Albania's&#13;
agricultural output, include 58 percent of the country's population, and account for 56 percent&#13;
of the Government's social assistance program (Annex 4.1). As noted, many of the road&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
improvements in this area complement irrigation improvements being made under the Irrigation&#13;
Rehabilitation Project. A second important agricultural area comprises the interior districts of&#13;
Pogradeci, Korga, and Devolli. This area accounts for 11 percent of agricultural value, 9 percent&#13;
of the population, and 5 percent of the Government's social assistance program.&#13;
C. Calculation and Results&#13;
4.05    The economic rates of return (ERRs) from improving 90 road sections included in the&#13;
project were estimated using the Bank's HDM Im model. The model's equations were adjusted&#13;
to reflect the high levels of roughness encountered. Present traffic levels were estimated on the&#13;
basis of traffic counts and the size of the agricultural area and population served. Traffic was&#13;
forecast taking into account the current (low) rate of motorization in Albania, recent (high)&#13;
traffic growth rates, motorization rates in other countries, and the expected growth of GDP, and&#13;
forecasts of increases in agricultural output in the project area. Vehicle operating costs were&#13;
estimated on the basis of international norms adjusted for local income levels. Construction cost&#13;
estimates were adjusted to remove taxes. Costs were shadow priced to reflect the high level of&#13;
unemployment, and the higher world price of bitumen. Road maintenance costs were taken into&#13;
account. The analysis was based on a ten year period, with the residual value of the investments&#13;
taken into account. Details of the economic evaluation are shown in Annex 4.2.&#13;
4.06    The ERR for road improvements are estimated to range from 11 percent to 140 percent&#13;
with a weighted average of 33 percent (Annex 3.1). The corresponding net present value (NPV)&#13;
at a 12 percent discount rate is estimated to be US$19.9 million (US$20,400/kin). If project&#13;
costs are underestimated by 25 percent (e.g., if labor costs increase), then the ERR would be&#13;
26 percent (NPV: US$ 16.9 million). If benefits are 25 percent less than expected (e.g., if the&#13;
operating costs of mostly old vehicles are substantially overestimated and traffic grows much less&#13;
than expected) then the ERR would be a still satisfactory 22 percent (NPV: US$ 11.5 million),&#13;
and the ERRs for about 252 km would fall below 10 percent. Traffic counts for marginal roads&#13;
would be updated if necessary, and cost estimates refined during project implementation to&#13;
assure that estimated ERRs for all road sections are above 10 percent (see below). The project&#13;
is, therefore, considered to be economically justified.&#13;
4.07    The economic evaluation was based on an assumed work program of 975 km (Annex&#13;
3.1). The Government agreed on the first year program at negotiations (para. 3.27). The list&#13;
of roads and design standards for the subsequent year would be defined and agreed during&#13;
project implementation. The GOA also agreed at negotiations that it will not undertake any&#13;
rural road investments under the project unless they are demonstrated, in a manner satisfactory&#13;
to the Association, to have an ERR of at least 10 percent. (para. 5.01(s)).&#13;
D. Risks&#13;
4.08    Albania has made good progress in implementing its economic reform program under&#13;
difficult economic conditions. The momentum for reform is being sustained, so that the risk of&#13;
a major setback in the reform process is considered to be small. One country risk which cannot&#13;
be assessed is the possible spread of regional conflicts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
4.09    One project risk is that the GOA would not provide sufficient funds to maintain the&#13;
project roads. However, they have increased the budget for maintaining the main road network&#13;
more rapidly than agreed under the ongoing Transport Project. A second project risk is that the&#13;
GOA would fail to implement the necessary reforms at the local govemment level to administer&#13;
and maintain the rural road network. However, they have already adopted legislation on local&#13;
government reform assisted by IDA, and are preparing legislation to fund rural road maintenance&#13;
(paras. 1.04 and 2.16). Project roads will be maintained by GRD, and permanent arrangements&#13;
for maintaining rural roads would be agreed with the Government following the Organization&#13;
and Management Study conclusions and recommendations (para. 3.30). An additional risk&#13;
relates to the complexity of organizing labor intensive road works. We will minimize this risk&#13;
by using consultants for supervision who are experienced in this area, and by training GRD staff&#13;
and local contractors. With the arrangements and assurances provided under the project, risks&#13;
are considered to be acceptable.&#13;
V. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;

year (para. 3.43); and&#13;
(s)   GOA will not undertake any rural road investments under the project unless&#13;
they are demonstrated, in a manner satisfactory to the Association, to have an&#13;
ERR of at least 10 percent (para. 4.07).&#13;
5.02   Establishment and staffing of the PIU (para. 3.24), and of its Secretariat (para. 3.25)&#13;
were conditions of negotiations duly fulfilled through MOC's Ministerial Order Number 648 of&#13;
March 3, 1995 (pam. 3.25).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
5.03   The appointment of the Project Coordinator, a condition of Board presentation, was&#13;
approved on May 1, 1995 (paras. 3.12 and 3.25).&#13;
5.04    The hiring of the international consultant supervision team is a condition of&#13;
effectiveness of the Credit (para. 3.08).&#13;
5.05    With the agreements reached above, the project is suitable for a SDR 10.1 million&#13;
(US$15.0 million equivalent) credit under the standard IDA terms, with 40 year maturity, to the&#13;
Government of Albania.&#13;

ALBANIA&#13;
RURAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Road Inprovement Measures&#13;
1.   Improvement measures. The base data used to define the improvement of the project&#13;
roads are: (i) road and soil conditions, (ii) condition of structures, and (iii) volume of traffic&#13;
anticipated by the year 2000, measured in vehicles per day (v.p.d.). The volume of traffic has&#13;
been used to define the road width and type of surfacing. The road and soil condition, together&#13;
with the traffic volumes, are the determining factors for the structural road design. The large&#13;
number of roads investigated and selected required the elaboration of generalized engineering&#13;
designs accurate enough for the purpose of the project.&#13;
2.    Road Width. Traffic volumes were divided into three categories, each defining a&#13;
specific road width:&#13;
Traffic Volume      Width of         Width of       Total Width&#13;
(v.p.d.)       carriage way      shoulders         of road&#13;
&gt; 250            5.00 m         2 x 0.75 m        6.50 m&#13;
100-250           5.50 m              -             5.50 m&#13;
&lt; 100            3.50 m         2 x 0.75 m        5.00 m&#13;
The carriageway width of 5.00 m together with the two shoulders of 0.75 m each and&#13;
the carriageway width of 5.50 m (without shoulders) allow a crossing of two trucks at reduced&#13;
speed. On the 3.50 m wide carriage way, crossing of trucks is only possible at reduced speed&#13;
and by using the adjacent shoulders. Omission of shoulders in the 100-250 v.p.d. category is&#13;
only for economy, but is technically acceptable. Road width within villages will be 6.00 m&#13;
without shoulders and with stone pitch lined drainage ditches on both road sides. The road&#13;
widths proposed above have been discussed with local engineers and the relevant authorities, and&#13;
according to their judgement, will not be in opposition to future standards.&#13;
3.    Road Surfaces. Roads with traffic volumes above 250 v.p.d. will be improved with a&#13;
penetration macadam (PM) surface. All other roads shall be given gravel surfaces. The&#13;
technique of PM surfacing is well known in Albania and will be used for the project. However,&#13;
the use of asphalt concrete (AC) and surfacing with cold mix using emulsion should not be&#13;
excluded as an alternative bid, if it can be justified.&#13;
4.    Structural Design. The three following road structure designs were based on the&#13;
recommendations from Road Note 31 (draft 4th edition) by TRRL, and Pavement Rehabilitation&#13;
and Strengthening Design, by M. Blumer, H¢nibach/Thun, Switzerland, and on observations of&#13;
available materials, technical considerations, input from local engineers, and costs.&#13;

5.    Road Types. Based on the selected road widths and surfaces, the project will include&#13;
four different road types: (i) PM (penetration macadam, 6.50m wide, 5.00m. carriageway; 2&#13;
shoulders of 0.75 m.), (ii) G5 (gravel surface 5.50 m. wide, 5.50 m. wide carriageway; no&#13;
shoulders), (iii) G3 (gravel surface 5.00 m. wide, 3.50 m. carriageway; 2 shoulders of 0.75 m.),&#13;
and (iv) village roads, (6.00 wide, 6.00 m. carriageway 1.20 m. stone pitched drainage side&#13;
ditches). These are shown in diagrams on the following page of this Annex.&#13;

RURAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Consultants for Construction Supervision, and&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
A.   Background and Introduction&#13;
1.    The Rural Roads Project will operate through an 8-month preparation period followed&#13;
by three years of construction, and will provide for improvement of some 975 km of short road&#13;
sections dispersed over 20 districts. In addition, it will assist in the development of the technical&#13;
and managerial capabilities of GOA institutions and of the emerging private construction&#13;
industry, and in the creation of a viable private consulting industry. It will also provide inputs&#13;
to improve management and techniques of road maintenance to assure conservation of every road&#13;
improved by means of the project.&#13;
2.    Physical improvement works will be undertaken under FIDIC organization with the&#13;
District Road Directorates as the "Employers". International consultants in collaboration with&#13;
local engineers/consultants will act as the "Engineer", providing adaptive designs and&#13;
construction supervision. Private contractors will be responsible for implementation. Up to 90&#13;
construction sites, and about 30 contracts, should be operational through the project period.&#13;
3.    Successful implementation of the project requires understanding of its wide scope, i.e.,&#13;
of the large number of work sites, the numerous "Employers", the range of objectives, and the&#13;
lack of experience of the participants. This will be addressed by providing a Project Coordinator,&#13;
using experienced international consultants and commencing with a one-year inception phase in&#13;
order to gain experience through the proposed organizational, managerial and technical&#13;
procedures, and assess the modifications required following a review of initial works.&#13;
B.   Objectives&#13;
4.    The consultants' two main objectives are provision of:&#13;
(i)   technical assistance to the General Roads Directorate, and the 20 involved District&#13;
Road Directorates in construction supervision, ensuring that appropriate levels of&#13;
quality, cost, and progress are achieved; and&#13;
(ii)  technical assistance to the GRD/DRDs, the local construction companies, and the&#13;
local consulting companies to ensure each is better able to address their roles in&#13;
the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 2 of 5&#13;
C.   Scope of Work&#13;
Construction supervision&#13;
5.    Improvement of 975 km of rural roads will require approximately 30 construction&#13;
contracts covering a total of around 90 road sections spread through 20 districts over a three&#13;
year project period. Supervision of these contracts on behalf of GRD/DRDs will be performed&#13;
by an international consultant with expatriate staff working in association with local engineers&#13;
and site supervisors. Their work will include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following&#13;
activities:&#13;
(i)   define contract packages at the beginning to ensure that a range of size and&#13;
complexity of contracts is provided, that the packages include realistic groupings&#13;
to minimize construction and supervision, particularly during the first year, and&#13;
to ensure that these packages are approved by GRD/DRDs. Contract packages&#13;
for subsequent years will be re-evaluated, where required, by means of traffic&#13;
surveys to confirm economic viability;&#13;
(ii)  review pre-qualification documentation, agree on criteria with GRD/DRDs, and&#13;
set up the procedures for advertising and evaluation of pre-qualification;&#13;
(iii)  evaluate pre-qualification documentation provided by contractors, and recommend&#13;
a list of qualified contractors to GRD/DRDs for the different types of contract;&#13;
(iv)   determine traffic measurements and review designs of the roads to be improved;&#13;
(v)   prepare tender documents for each contract, assist DRDs with any problems&#13;
during the bidding period and in the evaluation of tenders, and recommend to&#13;
DRDs which contractors should win each contract, following participation in&#13;
contract negotiations as required;&#13;
(vi)  prepare construction drawings with the contractor and provide the contractor with&#13;
all data for the execution of the works, including confirmations of all changes&#13;
specified to the tender designs during adaptation on site; review and approval of&#13;
any working drawings prepared by the contractor to adapt and finalize the general&#13;
designs for specific sites;&#13;
(vii)  issue revised plans and specifications as necessary, prepare variation orders and&#13;
assist DRDs in negotiating with the contractors;&#13;
(viii) review and approve the contractors' work schedules, and ensure that the works&#13;
are inspected and are in accordance with updated schedules and that progress is&#13;
being made as required to complete the works. Regular progress reports back to&#13;
DRD and GRD should be made;&#13;
(ix)  inspect all works to ensure that they conform to specifications and meet specified&#13;
quality standards and give immediate notice in writing to the contractor and DRD&#13;
of any defects, deficiencies or non-compliance;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-                           Annex 3.5&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
(x)   maintain a clear and permanent record of the quantities of work executed together&#13;
with clear permanent records of all quality control testing carried out during the&#13;
course of the works;&#13;
(xi)  assist the contractors in measurement and in preparation of monthly bills, which&#13;
should conform to DRD requirements, with details of quantity of work performed&#13;
during the current month, total work executed to date, evaluation and justification&#13;
for any extra work and stating the amount due to the contractor in total and for&#13;
the current month;&#13;
(xii)  report (monthly) progress of the works, by site and by contract, to GRD and PIU&#13;
with compilation reports of progress in all districts to GRD, including analysis of&#13;
problems in any area, with proposals for their resolution; and&#13;
(xiii) prepare completion reports for all contracts including any special as-built details.&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
6.    The consultant will provide support to each of the participants in the Project, i.e., the&#13;
General Roads Directorate, each of the twenty District Road Directorates, all local contractors&#13;
employed by the DRDs within the project, and the local engineers/consultants, in order to&#13;
promote the successful implementation of the various project objectives.&#13;
7.    Assistance to the General Roads Directorate in project management will be continuous&#13;
through the whole project implementation period. Working with the Project Coordinator, the&#13;
consultant will focus on specific aspects such as:&#13;
(i)  provision of job assistance in management of project planning and budgeting, cost,&#13;
quality and progress control during the course of working with the Project&#13;
Coordinator and his staff, and assurance by the consultant that training in the&#13;
practical use of computer facilities is provided in such a way that basic competence&#13;
in production of reports is facilitated, using word processing, spreadsheets and&#13;
project management programs or data bases;&#13;
(ii)  courses in management of contracts (FIDIC) given by a specialist experienced in&#13;
contracting; and&#13;
(iii) arrangement of study tours to Western Europe with 3 tours of 6 persons for a&#13;
period of approximately 10 days with emphasis on exchange of experience in the&#13;
fields of contract management, road system administration, and road rehabilitation&#13;
and maintenance techniques and systems.&#13;
8.    Assistance to District Road Directorates will largely be through a continuous on-the-job&#13;
basis. The consultant acting as "Engineer" will have continuous contact with the DRD as his&#13;
"Employer" and will provide assistance as necessary to permit effective management of contracts&#13;
(FIDIC), with emphasis on the DRD's duties as the "Employer" on the following basis:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-                           Annex 3.5&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
(i)  the consultant will assist the District Road Directorates in management of contracts,&#13;
accounting and assumption of the role of the Employer (cost, quality and progress&#13;
control), especially at crucial phases of the project (i.e., tender evaluation,&#13;
commencement of works, and taking-over of works);&#13;
(ii) the DRDs' extensive knowledge of local conditions will be utilized and the&#13;
consultant will seek full agreement on all details of improvement works. The&#13;
consultant will provide specialists to resolve any serious problems which may arise,&#13;
e.g., aspects of pavement technology or erosion protection but will seek to ensure&#13;
that such specialists are used to disseminate technical solutions as widely as possible&#13;
with seminars and site meetings involving more than a single district staff; and&#13;
(iii) during the second and third years of the project, the consultant will assist the DRDs&#13;
in improving and implementing the proposed maintenance concept with the&#13;
introduction of elements of a maintenance management system. Specific training&#13;
will be provided in the use of computers to improve accounting and general office&#13;
practices.&#13;
9.    Assistance to local contractors will be provided on request on such matters as site&#13;
organization, management of labor, maintenance and use of equipment, and contract&#13;
measurement and billing. Specific involvement will include pre-bid seminars for local contractors&#13;
with emphasis on pertinent sections of the general conditions of contract (FIDIC Part I) and on&#13;
particular applications for the Project (FIDIC Part II), the base for reasonable assessment of&#13;
construction rates for bidding and the best mix of labor-intensive methods with the necessary but&#13;
limited equipment.&#13;
10.   Technical assistance to contractors will include assistance in the definition of equipment&#13;
needs and in work preparation, and on-site support in site management and equipment&#13;
management. The extent of assistance depends on the contractors selected for execution of works&#13;
and has to be shaped according to their specific demands.&#13;
11.   The international consultants' work will depend very much upon their success in&#13;
developing the capacities of the local engineers employed so that they learn to assume their new&#13;
role as consultants. The project's objective is to use the consulting services required under the&#13;
Project to create three independent private engineering consultant companies. This will be&#13;
achieved through a process whereby individuals or groups of individuals will be hired by the&#13;
international consultant with the expressed aim of their moving from individual contracts of&#13;
employment at the commencement of the project to fee based payment through sub-contracts for&#13;
works by the end of the first year. The groups will provide full services but remain responsible&#13;
to the international consultant. In order to achieve this, the consultant will provide technical&#13;
assistance to the designated local staff and on-the-job training in supervision of construction&#13;
works (measurement and billing, control of cost, quality and progress) and contract management.&#13;
12.   In addition to the continuous on-the-job training provided by the resident team, the&#13;
international consultant will provide supplementary assistance specific to the build-up and&#13;
management of a consulting office with training in administration, accounting, cost calculation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-                             Annex 3.5&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
and control, quality assurance, business development etc.. The extent of assistance will depend&#13;
on the needs expressed by the local engineers/consultants.&#13;
13.   This transition from employee to associated local consultant is intended to take place as&#13;
early as possible but efforts in this direction are assumed to be concentrated in the second and&#13;
third years, when the priority work with DRDs and contractors starts to become better&#13;
understood. The international consultant will be responsible to assist in determining the most&#13;
appropriate legal basis for the local consultants, in assisting with appropriate organizational&#13;
structures and job classifications, staffing requirements and salary scales.&#13;
14.   Provision of procurement services for all items required by GRD and the consultar.t will&#13;
be done through international procurement. The items involved are assumed to be as specified&#13;
in this report but will be clarified in the inception report, see below.&#13;
15.   Monitoring of project activities is the responsibility of the Project Coordinator with the&#13;
provision that the consultant will be assisting this reporting in all areas. However, the following&#13;
reporting will be required directly from the consultant:&#13;
(i)  Inception report within six weeks of commencement of work. The report will&#13;

RURAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Project Coordinator&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
A.   BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The Rural Roads Project will operate through an eight-month preparation period and&#13;
three-year period of construction, and will provide for improvement of some 975 km of short&#13;
sections of roads dispersed over 20 districts. In addition, it will assist in the development of the&#13;
technical and managerial capabilities of GOA institutions, the emerging private construction&#13;
industry, and the creation of viable private sector consulting engineers. It will also provide&#13;
inputs to improve management and techniques of road maintenance to assure satisfactory&#13;
conservation of roads improved under the project.&#13;
2.    Physical improvement works will be undertaken under FIDIC organization with the&#13;
District Road Directorates as the 'Employers", international consultants in collaboration with&#13;
local engineers/consultants acting as the "Engineer", providing adaptive designs and construction&#13;
supervision, and private contractors responsible for detailed implementation. Through the project&#13;
period, up to 90 construction sites and about 30 contracts should be operational.&#13;
3.    Successful implementation of the project requires understanding of its wide scope,&#13;
including the large number of work sites, the numerous "Employers", the range of objectives,&#13;
and the lack of experience of the participants. This will be addressed by providing a Project&#13;
Coordinator, using an experienced international consultant and commencing with a one-year&#13;
inception phase with reduced targets to gain experience with the proposed organizational,&#13;
managerial and technical procedures, and providing for modifications following a review of&#13;
initial works.&#13;
B.   OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.    The Project Coordinator will provide a single channel of command for the project to&#13;
ensure that an up-to-date focus of knowledge is available to provide appropriate planning,&#13;
financial monitoring and progress reporting to Government departments, to the World Bank and&#13;
to other (Italy) project donors. The Project Coordinator will expand the capacity of the General&#13;
Roads Directorate to manage the project, whilst remaining within their established structure. He&#13;
will ensure that the funds provided are utilized so as to maintain the proper balance between&#13;
project beneficiaries and maximize overall benefits.&#13;
C. SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
5.    The Project Coordinator will be responsible to the Director General of the General Roads&#13;
Directorate (GRD) through the PIU Secretariat in the GRD Foreign Aid Department. He will&#13;
be supported by professional/supporting staff and the specialists of other departments within&#13;
GRD and will work closely with, and receive support from, the international consultants. He will&#13;
be required to work through the eight-month preparation period, and the three years of&#13;
construction works. The main tasks for the Project coordinator are described below.&#13;
&#13;

-52-                           Annex 3.7&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
Project coordination&#13;
6.    The Project Coordinator, through the PIU, will be responsible for liaison between GRD&#13;
and other Government ministries, departments and district authorities, with the World Bank and&#13;
Italy, with the international consultants, and with the DRDs for all activities of the Rural Roads&#13;
Project. He will ensure that official and practical liaison is maintained with others responsible&#13;
for Government programs, in particular the management of the Rural Poverty Alleviation Project&#13;
(or its successor), and the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project. His activities will be undertaken in&#13;
such manner as to provide appropriate information to all parties and to promote resolution of any&#13;
problems arising during implementation.&#13;
Planning and budgeting of works&#13;
7.    The Project Coordinator will be responsible for the development of annual work plans&#13;
as required by the World Bank. He will provide detailed plans for implementation and ensure&#13;
that the consultants, the appropriate DRDs and any other project-related bodies are fully involved&#13;
and provide all required base information. He will coordinate preparation of the project budget&#13;
and ensure that any administrative procedures for both budget preparation and expenditures are&#13;
in compliance with prevailing Government and Bank regulations.&#13;
Resource allocation and release of funds to DRDs&#13;
8.    The project budget will be contained in the investment budget for roads of the Ministry&#13;
of Construction but will be clearly separable since the World Bank credit and Italy loan will flow&#13;
through a special account operated at a commercial bank in Tirana. The Project Coordinator will&#13;
be responsible to:&#13;
(i)   provide documented submission of withdrawal application to the World Bank to&#13;
permit this account to be replenished in time to ensure that payments to&#13;
contractors are not delayed and that the progress of works is adhered to;&#13;
(ii)   arrange provision of letters of credit to permit the consultant to undertake the&#13;
international procurement required by the project, and to make payment to the&#13;
consultants in accordance with their contract; and&#13;
(iii)  release funds to the District Road Directorates on the basis of progress of works&#13;
actually achieved.&#13;
Selection of international consultant services and equipment required for the project.&#13;
9.    An early and urgent task of the Project Coordinator will be to advance the selection,&#13;
negotiation/award of contract to the international engineering consultant team. Following this&#13;
award he will provide assistance to the consultant in all matters connected with relations with&#13;
Government and ensure maximum utilization of the consultant in accordance with the&#13;
consultant's TOR.&#13;
10.   He will assist the consultant in defining items requiring international procurement,&#13;
including vehicles and equipment for use by GOA personnel and the consultant during the&#13;
implementation of the project. He will arrange letters of credit following Bank approval of these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 3 of 3&#13;
items and create and maintain an assets register for all Government equipment procured under&#13;
the project.&#13;
Finalization of pre-qualification and tender documents and issue of guidelines for pre-&#13;
qualification and tendering to the DRDs&#13;
11.   The Project Coordinator is responsible for the rapid and correct appointment of&#13;
contractors. He will, with the consultant, finalize pre-qualification and tender documents, issue&#13;
guidelines for local pre-qualification and tendering by the DRDs, and provide the support&#13;
required such that the DRDs are able to rapidly and effectively undertake this new role.&#13;
Reporting, monitoring of progress, quality and financial performance&#13;
12.   The efficient disbursement of project funds to the Government of Albania by the World&#13;
Bank depends upon proper reporting to the Bank of physical progress, development of&#13;
institutions, quality of works, and financial performance. It is the responsibility of the Project&#13;
Coordinator to provide such reporting on time and meeting the content requirements as may be&#13;
required from time to time by the Bank.&#13;
13.   The Project Coordinator will be responsible to provide financial monitoring of all&#13;
expenditure under the credit and to request such assistance from the consultant and the DRDs&#13;
to ensure this occurs. This will include quarterly and annual progress and financial reports to&#13;
the GOA, the World Bank, and Italy, in accordance with their reporting requirements.&#13;
14.   He will also provide comprehensive information on rehabilitation works including the&#13;
extent of work progress, labor involvement, work quality and payments made and due to&#13;
contractors and the overall situation. He will include progress reports on institutional&#13;
developments, including consultant and contractor support and performance of consultants, and&#13;
districts staff including any improved maintenance introduced. He will provide copies of any&#13;
amended design proposals, consultants construction manuals and road performance studies. The&#13;
basic monitoring framework will be as provided in the Annex 3.12, Project Monitoring Matrix&#13;
(Monitoring Indicators), but will be supplemented in cooperation with the consultant.&#13;
15.   He will prepare and provide to the GOA, the World Bank, and Government of Italy&#13;
monthly statements on all financial records including: (i) withdrawals from IDA credit, Italy&#13;
loan, and GOA's participation with copies of disbursement requests and related documentation;&#13;
(ii) records of transactions of the Project account including copies of bank statements and&#13;
balances; and (iii) information on any outstanding claims to the Bank and upon the Project by&#13;
contractors or arising from procurement.&#13;
Technical services to DRDs&#13;
16.   The Project Coordinator will provide to the DRDs any details of technical standards&#13;
required and results of any technical audits such as evaluation of gravels, bitumen or concrete&#13;
which have not been conducted locally.&#13;

RURAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Organization and Management Study&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
A.   Introduction&#13;
1.    There are approximately 18,000 km of roads in Albania, with 2,400 km classified as&#13;
primary roads, 5,000 km as secondary roads, some 1,000 km as urban roads, and the remaining&#13;
9,500 km as tertiary or local (rural) roads. The General Roads Directorate (GRD) of the&#13;
Ministry of Construction and Tourism (MOC) is responsible for the construction, rehabilitation&#13;
and maintenance of some 7,400 km of the primary and secondary roads, and the municipalities&#13;
administer the 1,000 km of urban roads. The remaining 9,500 km were previously managed by&#13;
a variety of state farms, cooperatives and communes which have disappeared. According to the&#13;
Law No. 7572 of Local Government of June 10, 1992, the latter are now the responsibility of&#13;
the 36 local elected legislative bodies called the district councils, with the possibility left open&#13;
for them to delegate further to a commune or baskia (town) council. Although the legal&#13;
responsibility for this lowest level of the road system is clear, the system is not yet implemented.&#13;
Neither the districts nor the communes have a budget adequate to meet their responsibilities at&#13;
present. In addition, they have insufficient technical capacity and, in matters related to roads,&#13;
it appears common for the commune or baskia to approach the GRD's District Road Directorates&#13;
(DRDs) for informal technical advice. The GRD has recommended, and the Ministry of the&#13;
Interior plans, to provide the district councils with more realistic budgets for road maintenance&#13;
beginning in 1995, and to arrange with individual communes for local sources of taxation to&#13;
finance local road maintenance.&#13;
3.    Over the last decade, and particularly since 1991 most secondary and tertiary roads have&#13;
deteriorated severely due to lack of maintenance, to the extent that many of these roads are&#13;
inaccessible to motorized vehicles during part of the year and many of them are in poor&#13;
condition even during the dry season. In addition, all roads were designed to carry a small fleet&#13;
of state owned vehicles, in an era when there were severe restrictions on personal mobility. The&#13;
number of registered vehicles has grown some six-fold during the last four years and is expected&#13;
to continue growing rapidly. Traffic counts carried out in 1994 on 40 sections of secondary and&#13;
tertiary roads ranged from 60 vpd to as high as 1,670 vpd (excluding agricultural and animal&#13;
drawn traffic). Truck sizes have increased from a typical weight of five tons per single axle&#13;
to ten tons per single axle on the asphalted roads (often 11.5 tons, as presently authorized in the&#13;
European Community), and six tons on the rest of the network. Significant numbers of heavy&#13;
articulated trucks are now in use, and these are even appearing on tertiary roads. There are no&#13;
axle-load limitations at present, and this issue is being investigated with the assistance of&#13;
advisors under the Transport Project. As a consequence, almost all of the paved roads need to&#13;
be rehabilitated, investments are required to increase capacity on some sections of primary&#13;
roads, and sections of the secondary and tertiary networks require improvement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-55-                          Annex&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
4.    GRD was reorganized (Organizational Decision of December 29, 1993) in March 1994&#13;
under the Ministry of Construction, Housing, and Territory Adjustment, presently the Ministry&#13;
of Construction and Tourism (MOC), as a continuation of the former National Roads&#13;
Department (NRD) of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC). GRD is presently&#13;
responsible for secondary roads and even some tertiary roads. Government has also applied for&#13;
IDA assistance to finance a Rural Roads Project, and has agreed to be responsible for all roads&#13;
which would be improved under the project. GRD is supported by consultants under the ongoing&#13;
Transport Project in developing appropriate management and monitoring systems for its road&#13;
network, including the determination of a work program, staffing requirements, job&#13;
classification, and training requirements. Advisors are also assisting GRD to review the road&#13;
network which it will retain under its own responsibility. This review is expected to be&#13;
completed before the start of the present study.&#13;
5.    The Organization and Management (O&amp;M) study would be financed under the proposed&#13;
Rural Roads Project. The purpose of the study is to identify and inventory the non-GRD road&#13;
network (around 9,500 km) and to analyze, recommend and prepare to implement the most&#13;
appropriate system for assuring its administration, financing and maintenance.&#13;
B.   Objectives&#13;
6.    The objectives of the study are to:&#13;
(a)   identify and inventory the network of roads which are not managed by GRD, not&#13;
including urban streets or roads which are under the direct responsibility of&#13;
forestry or industrial enterprises;&#13;
(b)   assess the functions, legal responsibilities and capability of the main organizations&#13;
potentially involved in administering, financing and maintaining the non-GRD&#13;
road networkl;&#13;
(c)   recommend a system for administering, financing and maintaining the non-GRD&#13;
roads; and&#13;
(d)   recommend a practical plan for maintaining and improving the non-GRD roads,&#13;
estimate budgetary requirements, specify organizational responsibilities, and&#13;
propose a practical plan of implementation including transition and training&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
C.   Scope of Consultant Services&#13;
7.    The consultant will build upon the work under the Transport Project defining the&#13;
responsibilities of GRD, as well as on recent reforms of local Government. The study will&#13;
determine whether the best solution is to decentralize responsibilities to the communes or an&#13;
association of communes (decentralized solution), or centralize responsibility under GRD, e.g.,&#13;
through a sub-directorate for rural roads (centralized solution),. Other possibilities include a&#13;
mixture of GRD and main commune responsibilities, or to have GRD only intervene in the most&#13;
difficult tasks and provide technical assistance to the communes.  The consultant will liaise&#13;
closely with each of the organizations likely to play a role in administering non-GRD roads&#13;
&#13;

8.    The consultant will carry out, inter alia, the following tasks:&#13;
(a)   identify the non-GRD road network (expected to be around 9,500 km);&#13;
(b)   review the existing situation for managing non-GRD roads and determine the most&#13;
appropriate basis for dividing responsibilities between the various organizations&#13;
involved;&#13;
(c)   assess the capacity of GRD to administer additional roads with particular&#13;
emphasis upon the extent and role the field network of 28 DRDs could play in&#13;
maintaining these roads;&#13;
(d)   review and assess the legal responsibility, interest, and financial and technical&#13;
capacity of the Districts and representative Communes for maintaining non-GRD&#13;
roads,&#13;
(e)   review the responsibility and present role of central Government for funding the&#13;
maintenance of non-GRD roads;&#13;
(f)   assess the availability of local contracting capacity for road maintenance;&#13;
(g)   assess and recommend the most cost effective means of maintaining the non-GRD&#13;
network;&#13;

authority for the DRDs and/or other responsible organizations;&#13;
(i)   determine the training requirements and interim institutional support required to&#13;
carry out revised responsibilities;&#13;
Gj)   undertake an inventory of non-GRD roads, making maximum use of information&#13;
currently available with the DRDs, and supplementing it to ensure that a basic&#13;
knowledge of the length, structures and general condition are recorded together&#13;
with outline of the function of the road with estimates of population served and&#13;
numbers of villages connected in such a form that future development of the&#13;
inventory will be possible using local consultants;&#13;
(k)   define work methods, prepare an indicative work program which gives priority&#13;
to the conservation of existing roads and determine budgetary requirements and&#13;
sources for each responsible organization;&#13;
(1)   review  the existing legal instruments which would be used to transfer&#13;
responsibility to a new organization;&#13;

(n)   determine the legal and physical situation regarding right-of-way and the means&#13;
by which this may best be preserved or increased as may be required.&#13;
D.   Staffing and Time Schedule&#13;
9.    The study would be carried out in two phases, in order to expedite key Government&#13;
decisions which would be implemented under the proposed Rural Roads Project. Phase I would&#13;
identify the non-NRD roads and make preliminary administrative recommendations for&#13;
consideration by Government.  Phase II would include the preparation of detailed&#13;
recommendations following the receipt of comments on the Phase I report, plus the detailed&#13;
inventory of the network.&#13;
10.   It is envisaged that the above assignment would require the following skills, which&#13;
would need to be combined into a small number of staff assisted by local staff to carry out the&#13;
road inventory:&#13;
(a)   experience in the management of public works agencies preferably including&#13;
experience in Eastern Europe or other countries in transition from socialist to free&#13;
market economies;&#13;
(b)   experience in local Government administration and reform: and&#13;
(c)   experience in road maintenance programming and costing, small scale works, the&#13;
introduction of contract based systems, and working under conditions of severe&#13;
budgetary constraint.&#13;
E.   Reporting&#13;
9.    The consultant will prepare and submit the following reports in English:&#13;
(a)   Phase I Report (10 copies) within four months of commencement of works.&#13;
(b)   Draft Final Report (10 copies) within four months of receiving comments on the&#13;
Phase I Report;&#13;
(c)   Final Report (25 copies) within three weeks of receipt of comments on the Draft&#13;
Final Report.&#13;

ALBANIA&#13;
RURAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Assessment&#13;
Direct and Indirect impacts of the Project&#13;
and Mitigation Measures to be taken&#13;
1.   Improvement of rural roads can have important effects upon the physical environment.&#13;
Direct impacts may be anticipated only in the immediate environs of the improved roads, whilst&#13;
indirect impacts will gradually arise, and over a wider area, as a consequence of improved&#13;
access.&#13;
2.   In the proposed project, direct environmental impacts are anticipated to be very limited&#13;
because:&#13;
3     no new roads will be constructed&#13;
*     only existing alignments will be used&#13;
3     improved access is focused upon areas with high agricultural production and will&#13;
not provide access to areas with sensitive ecosystems or to forest areas where&#13;
unregulated exploitation could arise&#13;
3.    However, there are three areas in which indirect adverse impacts could arise:&#13;
e     use of mineral reserves in previously unexploited river beds for road gravel&#13;
e     additional dust problems along roads, particularly in villages&#13;
3     erosion from gravel roads&#13;
Satisfactory solutions to all these potentially adverse impact factors have been formulated&#13;
in the project.&#13;
4.    River bed gravels. The use of river gravel is likely to permit substantial savings in&#13;
transport cost compared with past stone production systems which were centralized and involved&#13;
very long haulage distances. Recently, numerous small private crushing plants have arisen,&#13;
generally in river beds, to exploit more easily accessible resources. This trend is likely to&#13;
continue and be encouraged by the sales to the project. The benefits of reduction in vehicle&#13;
pollution will accordingly be countered by possible damage in river beds. In the proposed&#13;
project, all contracts would designate the non-sensitive bed areas for gravel sources, with the&#13;
project management retaining the power to prohibit the unlikely use of any potentially sensitive&#13;
river bed area.&#13;
5.    Dust. Dust is a severe problem on gravel and earth roads in Albania. It is particularly&#13;
grave during the dry summer period. The project has addressed this problem by including&#13;
penetration macadam (PM) road sections through most villages, complemented with the&#13;
construction of roadside drainage to improve the awful conditions caused by water in most&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-67-&#13;
Annex 3.14&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
villages during the winter. The additional expenditure included in the project for such road&#13;
paving and drainage in villages will substantially improve living conditions for around 100,000&#13;
people living in villages and settlements in the area of the project. This improvement will&#13;
particularly be helpful to women and children who spend most of their time in the villages and&#13;
necessarily move along the roads for unfortunate tasks such as transporting household water&#13;
supplies and firewood.&#13;
6.    Erosion. Erosion from gravel roads can choke watercourses adjacent to the road. This&#13;
condition is most likely to arise on steep roads in areas of high rainfall, following a lack of&#13;
maintenance, or because of poor grain size distribution in the gravel, or because of poor&#13;
compaction. The project has a limited length of steep section in high rainfall areas and answers&#13;
these problems through a mandatory selection of gravel in every contract to prevent poor grain&#13;
distribution, and specific compaction requirements. It also includes assistance in improving&#13;
technical specifications and practices for maintenance, and it ensures adequate maintenance&#13;
budgets for all project roads.&#13;
7.    The increase of economic activity and agricultural production, and the easier connection&#13;
among the villages could increase the use of chemicals in agriculture and facilitate outwards&#13;
immigration. However, adverse effects from increases in the use of chemicals should be kept&#13;
within reason because the improved roads will also facilitate existing agriculture advice services.&#13;
Outward migration would diminish because the improved access to health, education, and&#13;
business opportunities facilitated by better roads would provide a strong stimulus to staying in&#13;
the villages.&#13;
8.    All contracts require proper disposal of waste materials generated during construction as&#13;
well as proper sanitary waste disposal for labor intensive crews.&#13;

RURAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Details of the Economic Evaluation'&#13;
1.    Traffic: Traffic surveys were undertaken in April and July 1994 on 37 of the 90 roads&#13;
in the project area. The survey took place on one normal week day during either a 16 or 24&#13;
hour period, with vehicles classified into eight categories.   These figures (excluding animal&#13;
traffic and motorcycles) were adjusted to an annual basis by reducing them by 8 percent to allow&#13;
for lower weekend traffic, and by a further 20 percent to allow for the surveys being carried out&#13;
during the growing season. Results are shown in the Attachment. Traffic levels were then&#13;
correlated with the population, agricultural area and the value of agricultural production of the&#13;
area served by each road section in the project. The best fit was obtained by weighting&#13;
agricultural production 60% and population 40%, with an average error of 15% in the estimated&#13;
traffic level. This relationship was then used to estimate traffic levels on project roads where&#13;
traffic surveys were not carried out.&#13;
2.    Traffic was projected from 1994 to 2004 taking into account recent traffic trends, the&#13;
current level of motorization in Albania and trends in other countries, projected GNP growth&#13;
and agricultural potential. Albania's road vehicle fleet doubled in size from 1992 to 1994 (Table&#13;
1.2). The most recent growth rates are also high, with car registrations increasing 26 percent&#13;
and truck registrations 16 percent during the first three months of 1994. The passenger car fleet&#13;
is expected to grow at more than double the rate of GNP on average for at least the next several&#13;
years (para. 1.10). The balance of the road vehicle fleet is likely to grow at a slightly slower&#13;
rate.&#13;
3.    Agricultural forecasts were also prepared for each irrigated and non-irrigated area within&#13;
the project region by type of terrain. The value of agricultural output is generally expected to&#13;
increase by 50-100 percent in these areas, as detailed in the ITECO study. Taking all these&#13;
factors into account, traffic was forecast to grow 40 percent from the end of 1993 to mid-1995,&#13;
with the growth rate then slowing to six percent p.a. thereafter until 2004. This implies Albanian&#13;
vehicle registration levels in 2004 of 135 vehicles per 1,000 people, which is 85 percent of the&#13;
level achieved in Bulgaria, or 54 percent of the level achieved in Greece, in 1991. Traffic&#13;
forecasts are, therefore, considered to be conservative.&#13;
4.    The surveys revealed that traffic on some road sections was suppressed due to their poor&#13;
condition, and these roads were not included in the above statistical analysis (para. 1). In order&#13;
not to overestimate project benefits on these sections, 50 percent of the traffic on "bad" sections,&#13;
'The report 'Albania Feeder Roads Study' prepared by consultants ITECO dated July 1994 contains&#13;
additional information on the economic evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 4.2&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
25 percent of the traffic on "poor" sections, and 10 percent on "fair" sections, was considered&#13;
to be induced traffic. Corresponding project benefits were reduced by 50 percent in accordance&#13;
with conventional practice.&#13;
5.    Economic Costs: The engineering cost estimates (including the cost of supervision and&#13;
physical contingencies) were adjusted to take into account economic distortions and to remove&#13;
taxes which are transfer payments. Labor costs comprise around 45 percent of construction&#13;
costs. Since unemployment is estimated to be around 30 percent, the cost of unskilled labor was&#13;
valued at 50 percent of the wage rate (skilled labor was valued at 100 percent of the wage rate).&#13;
This adjustment reduced the cost of constructing both gravel and bitumen surfaced roads by 19.2&#13;
percent. Diesel fuel presently has a real tax element (retail price less border price plus the cost&#13;
of distribution) of about 50 percent. Since diesel fuel comprises an estimated 37 percent of the&#13;
cost of constructing gravel roads (due to relatively long material haulage distances) and 20&#13;
percent of the cost of bitumen roads, their costs were reduced by 18.5 and 10 percent&#13;
respectively. The cost for both types of construction were also reduced by 10 percent to account&#13;
for the estimated tax component of material costs.  Bitumen accounts for approximately 23&#13;
percent of the cost of paved roads. The domestic price of bitumen is about 50 percent of the&#13;
world price, so that the economic cost of bitumen surfaced roads was increased by 23 percent&#13;
to compensate for this underpricing. In summary, the financial costs of gravel surfaced roads&#13;
were reduced by 52.7 percent and bitumen roads by 21.2 percent in the economic evaluation.&#13;
The construction costs for each road section are listed in Annex 3.2.&#13;
6.    Economic maintenance costs were based on engineering cost estimates, adjusted in the&#13;
same way as construction costs (para. 5). Routine maintenance costs for new bitumen roads&#13;
were estimated to increase from 19,000 lek/km in 1995 to 65,000 lek/km in 2003; it was also&#13;
assumed the road would be resealed in 2006 at a cost of 873,000 lek/km. Maintenance of&#13;
existing bitumen roads was estimated to cost 89,000 lek/km. Routine maintenance costs for&#13;
improved gravel roads are expected to range between 25,000 and 43,000 leks/km according to&#13;
age and traffic level. It was estimated that these roads would need to be regravelled in 2004 at&#13;
a cost ranging from 231,000 to 1,348,000 lek/km according to terrain and traffic level. The cost&#13;
of maintaining (but not improving) existing gravel roads was estimated to be 20,000 lek/km.&#13;
7.    Vehicle Operating Costs: Vehicle operating costs (voc) were estimated using the Banks&#13;
HDM-III model. Model equations were adjusted to take into account the poor condition of roads&#13;
in Albania. Most of the existing roads were made from large stones, as in medieval or earlier&#13;
times, and overlaid with a cosmetic skin of gravel or penetration macadam which has now&#13;
largely disappeared due to lack of maintenance. Many of these roads are so rough that travel&#13;
is restricted to 5-10 km per hour. Roughness, as measured on the international roughness index&#13;
(IRI), could be as high as 30 m/km. The HDM-III model (and other known models) are not&#13;
calibrated to accommodate this high degree of roughness. The HDM m equations were,&#13;
therefore, extrapolated to provide voc estimates.  IRIs were estimated to average 6.5 on&#13;
improved paved roads, 8.0 on improved gravel roads, 12.0 on all roads in "fair" condition, 16.0&#13;
for all roads in "poor" condition, and 23.0 for all roads in "bad" condition.  Taking into&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-71-&#13;
Annex 4.2&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
account the composition of motorized vehicles observed on the project roads, the corresponding&#13;
average vehicle operating costs were estimated to be 3.7, 8.0, 12.0, 46.0, and 65 lek/km&#13;
respectively.&#13;
8.    Albania does not yet assemble statistics on vehicle operating costs. HDM III inputs&#13;
were, therefore, estimated using typical international values, modified to take into account local&#13;
economic conditions. Unskilled labor was valued at 252 leks/day, the same value as used in the&#13;
analysis of construction costs. A nominal value of passenger travel time was included (57.3&#13;
lek/car/1000 km and 745 leklbus/1000 km) Vehicle spare parts were valued at 40 percent of&#13;
their international price to take into account the significant amount of cannibalization which takes&#13;
place.&#13;
9.    Analysis Period: Proposed road improvements were evaluated for a ten-year period.&#13;
The residual value of the improvements in year ten was taken as a project benefit, assuming&#13;
proper maintenance as discussed. Residual values were estimated to consist of 80 percent of the&#13;
value of the base and sub-base, 75 percent of the value of the gravel surface and 27 percent of&#13;
the pavement, 25 percent of drainage works, 50 percent of drainage walls and concrete works,&#13;
and 60 percent of village works. The costs of periodic maintenance were prorated.&#13;
10.   Design Standards: The expected lifetime cost of a five meter penetration macadam road&#13;
(construction, maintenance and vehicle operating costs) was compared with that of a five meter&#13;
gravel road. Gravel is not normally available near roads located in flat (irrigated) areas which&#13;
comprise most of the project (haulage distances are frequently greater than 15 km). A second&#13;
factor which favors the choice of paved roads is the expected rapid growth of traffic discussed&#13;
above (para. 3). A rough calculation based on generalized costs indicates that it may be more&#13;
economic to pave roads which carry as little as 100 vpd in 1994 (180 vpd expected by 2000),&#13;
or about 90 percent of project roads. In order to be conservative, it was assumed that only&#13;
roads carrying more than 250 vpd in 2000 would be paved, or about 60 percent of project roads&#13;
(Annex 3.2). Calculations would be refined on a road by road basis, and design standards&#13;
finalized, during project implementation.&#13;

            The main objectives of the Rural Roads
            Project are: 1) to promote agricultural development by
            rehabilitating and maintaining rural roads serving
            agricultural areas and to improve access, economic and
            social services for rural population centers; 2) to
            establish the institutional and financial arrangements for
            administering and maintaining rural roads on a sustainable
            basis; 3) to reduce poverty and increase employment by
            carrying out project works with labor intensive methods; and
            4) to encourage the development of the domestic contracting
            and consulting industries. The project includes: 1)
            improvement of 975 km of rural roads by contractors using
            labor intensive methods; 2) provision of office and
            transport equipment; 3) operational costs; 4) supervision of
            works; 5) technical assistance, a project coordinator, and
            training to implement the project; and 6) an Organization
            and Management Study, including an inventory of the 9,500 km
            rural road network and an anlaysis and definition of the
            best institutional, managerial, and financial arrangements
            of its administration.
