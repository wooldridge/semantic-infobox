GLOSSARY: WHAT DO WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY . . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Cognizant of the definition below, in this roadmap we consider biodiversity as the living natural capital that supplements and influences&#13;
economic growth and human well-being. We consistently refer to biodiversity in the context of conservation and sustainable use. We&#13;
view biodiversity in the context of ecosystem services, to which it is inextricably linked, and in the way biodiversity and habitat change are&#13;
manifested through the provisioning of these services. Biodiversity is essential for ecosystem functions, and functional diversity is important&#13;
for supporting the flow of ecosystem goods and services, including maintaining resilience to disturbances such as climate change.&#13;
&#13;
Biodiversity is the variability among living organisms from all sources including, among others, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic&#13;
ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species, and among&#13;
different ecosystems.&#13;
&#13;
Ecosystems are ever-changing complexes of living things interacting with the non-living environment. People are integral parts of&#13;
ecosystems; our actions shape ecosystems and our well-being is tied to them. Ecosystem services span the whole pathway from ecological&#13;
processes (for example, biomass, soil formation) through final ecosystem services (for example, water regulation) and goods (for example,&#13;
drinking water), to their values to humans (for example, sanitation and health). This document includes examples where biodiversity pro-&#13;
vides provisioning and regulating ecosystem services.&#13;
&#13;
Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from the activity or functions of ecosystems.&#13;
&#13;
Ecosystem resilience is the capacity of an ecosystem to tolerate disturbance without collapsing into a qualitatively different state that&#13;
is controlled by a different set of processesâ&#128;&#148;an ecosystem that can withstand shocks and rebuild itself when necessary. People depend&#13;
on and impact ecosystems and the services they provide from local to global scales. Resilience in social systems has the added capacity of&#13;
humans to anticipate and plan for the future. Resilience is a property of these linked social-ecological systems.&#13;
&#13;
Green economy and growth is low carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive.&#13;
&#13;
Green growth improves human well-being and social equity. It enhances shared prosperity while significantly reducing environmental risks&#13;
and ecological scarcities. Transition pathways depend on domestic context, natural capital, and socio-economic priorities.&#13;
&#13;
Natural capital is the Earthâ&#128;&#153;s living and nonliving natural assets such as soil, air, water, flora, and fauna. Biodiversity is the foundation of the&#13;
living natural capital. Ecosystem goods and services can be seen as the returns from natural capital underpinning conventionally measured&#13;
economic growth, providing inputs and increasing the productivity of economies. Maintaining the stock of natural capital sustains the flow&#13;
of ecosystem goods and services valuable to our societies, economies, and human well-being.&#13;
&#13;
Natural infrastructure is the network of natural and semi-natural areas, features, and green spaces in the broader rural and&#13;
urban landscape and seascape. It enhances biodiversity conservation, ecosystem health and resilience, and human well-&#13;
being through the maintenance and enhancement of ecosystem services. Sometimes termed green infrastructure, it can be&#13;
strengthened through strategic and coordinated initiatives that focus on maintaining, restoring, improving, and connecting&#13;
existing areas and features, as well as creating new ones.&#13;

            Investing in natural capital for
            eradicating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity :
            a biodiversity roadmap for the WBG
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The World Bank Group (WBG) has a long
            experience in engaging in biodiversity with world-class
            expertise in the field. It has been the single largest
            funder of biodiversity investments since the late 1980s. The
            WBG investments have largely been of two kinds: (1)
            investments in biodiversity, aimed at the conservation and
            sustainable use of species, habitats, and ecosystems that
            sustain healthy ecosystems, while enhancing people's
            livelihoods and safety nets. These investments have also
            been providing jobs and economic development in frequently
            impoverished rural areas for example by supporting protected
            areas and an increasingly important tourism industry; and
            (2) investments that add value to projects in other sectors,
            such as irrigation, hydropower, and infrastructure, by
            increasing their environmental sustainability. The WBG is a
            global center of excellence that provides economy wide
            technical and economic knowledge and expertise on
            biodiversity and ecosystems. It has the standing and
            convening power to facilitate participatory dialogue between
            client countries and networks of other relevant stakeholders
            on matters of biodiversity and climate change concern, such
            as loss of ecosystem resilience, forest law enforcement and
            governance, wildlife trade, and overexploitation of natural resources.
