Chapter I&#13;
The Energy Sector&#13;
A. Overview&#13;
1.1        The social and economic transformation in Thailand over the past 25 years has resulted in&#13;
rapid growth in energy consumption. Most of this growth was initially met by energy imports: at the&#13;
time of the 1979/80 oil crisis, Thailand's dependence on imported oil was in excess of 90% of total&#13;
primary commercial energy. In the ensuing years, however, efforts made by the Thai Government to&#13;
promote the development of indigenous energy resources have had a visible impact on the pattern of&#13;
commercial energy consumption.&#13;
1.2       In 1993, the total supply of commercial energy in Thailand of about 33 million tons of oil&#13;
equivalent (toe) increased two and a half times over 1983 levels, and was growing at an average rate of&#13;
11% per year. Of the total amount, 62% was supplied by petroleum, 21% by natural gas, 13% by&#13;
lignite, 3% by hydro power and 1 % by coal. In addition, Thailand consumed about 10 million toe of&#13;
renewable energy in 1991, mainly in the form of fuel wood which remained the predominant fuel in&#13;
rural households. Despite the country's impressive economic growth (of 8% per year for the last six&#13;
years), per capita commercial energy consumption has been fairly modest and comparable to that of a&#13;
low-income developing country. The modest consumption pattern is due to the large rural population&#13;
and the relatively high price of commercial energy (compared with rural income levels), which places&#13;
commercial energy beyond the reach of the lower income group. The outlook is, therefore, for rapid&#13;
growth in commercial energy consumption as the economy continues expanding.&#13;
B. Resource Endowment&#13;
1.3        Thailand has a diversified energy resource base, consisting of bio-mass, petroleum (oil and&#13;
natural gas), lignite, hydropower, and geothermal energy, the latter being still at an exploratory stage in&#13;
the northern region. However, Thailand's indigenous resources are limited in comparison to its needs,&#13;
and the country's energy imports will increase over the years.&#13;
Oil and Gas&#13;
1.4        Given the geological features of the country's hydrocarbon basins, crude oil is not&#13;
expected to be a major contributor to Thailand's resource base. At the end of 1993, there were about&#13;
245 million barrels of proven and probable oil reserves. Of these, about 177 million barrels are&#13;
condensate, which would have to be produced in association with offshore gas, and about 68 million&#13;
barrels are crude oil. There are additional oil reserves of about 440 million barrels. Production is&#13;
currently limited to Phet crude from the Sirikit oil field, producing about 22,000 barrels per day (bpd)&#13;
in 1993. An additional 26,000 bpd of condensate was produced in association with gas from offshore&#13;
fields in the Gulf of Thailand. To meet the oil demand, Thailand imported 163,000 bpd of finished&#13;
petroleum products and 321,000 bpd of crude oil for processing in its three local refineries in 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
1.5        The country's natural gas resources are limited and Thailand would not be able to produce&#13;
sufficient gas to meet the demand over the next 30 years. Natural gas has been discovered mostly by&#13;
companies looking for oil. At the end of 1993, the remaining proven and probable reserves were about&#13;
6.5 trillion cubic feet. Gas production in 1993 was 930 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd), of which&#13;
880 mmcfd were produced from the offshore fields. Considering the country's limited supply, Thailand&#13;
would be looking towards importing piped gas from neighboring countries (potentially from Malaysia,&#13;
Myanmar and, recently, Viet Nam), or importing from international markets in the form of LNG.&#13;
Negotiations are well on their way for import of piped gas from Myannar.&#13;
Lignite&#13;
1.6        Thailand's coal resources are all relatively low grade, of the variety generally categorized&#13;
as lignite. Geological lignite reserves amount to a total of 2.1 billion tons, i.e., 3.7 billion barrels of&#13;
oil equivalent, 69% of which is in the Mae Moh basin in northern Thailand which has been developed&#13;
by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). Economically minable reserves are&#13;
estimated at 1,330 million tons (MMt), of which 1,152 MMt are located in Mae Moh. The output at&#13;
Mae Moh, is currently at a level of about 7 million tpa. Earlier plans to expand Mae Moh mining to a&#13;
level of 31 million tpa by 1998 (enough to support power generation of 4,700 MW), have had to be&#13;
severely curtailed due to geotechnical and environmental problems. While potential for additional&#13;
lignite discoveries is good - recent nation-wide exploration by EGAT has resulted in a number of&#13;
discoveries, including that in 1987 of a major deposit at Saba Yoi in southern Thailand with potential&#13;
reserves in excess of 200 MMt - its commercial exploitation is in doubt due to political reasons. With&#13;
uncertainties surrounding the development of the country's lignite resources it would be necessary to&#13;
import coal and establish coal-fired generation by as early as 2000. Recently, prospects have emerged&#13;
for development of lignite-fired power in Laos, which could be exported to Thailand.&#13;
Hydropower&#13;
1.7        Thailand's hydropower potential, excluding that of its two main international rivers -- the&#13;
Mekong and the Salween -- is estimated at 11,700 MW. Of this, about 2,400 MW, with an annual&#13;
generation capability of 4,500 GWh, have already been harnessed by EGAT. Increasing opposition&#13;
from the public and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to the construction of dams would make&#13;
development of hydropower extremely difficult, and Thailand cannot look forward to any significant&#13;
development of this renewable energy resource. On the other hand, development of pump storage&#13;
projects which does not involve damming of rivers and entails minimum ecological and social impacts&#13;
would be pursued whenever it is economically viable compared to the next best option of peaking&#13;
internal combustion turbines.&#13;
1.8        The hydropower potential of rivers within Thailand is dwarfed by that of rivers forming&#13;
the Thai frontier with Laos and Burma. The development of possible sites on the main rivers would&#13;
require agreement between the riparian powers, including in particular acceptable terms for Thailand to&#13;
use a major part of the energy generated since the other countries are unlikely to be in a position to&#13;
absorb the energy provided by such projects. Negotiations have recently been completed for import of&#13;
hydropower from Laos which would be produced jointly by international private organizations and the&#13;
Lao Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
Bio-mass&#13;
1.9        The process of modernization occurring in rural Thailand notwithstanding, use of&#13;
traditional fuels has remained predominant in rural areas. About two-thirds of the reliance on bio-mass&#13;
consists of charcoal and firewood use by rural households (at the rate of about 10 MMtoe/year), and&#13;
consequently forests near inhabited areas have been heavily over-cut. The remaining third of bio-mass&#13;
supply consists of bagasse and paddy husks used as fuel in the sugar and rice industries. Thailand&#13;
suffers from an increasing scarcity of wood fuels and other wood products, particularly in the northeast.&#13;
In 1993, the Government launched a nationwide reforestation campaign that would involve the public&#13;
and the private sectors and the rural population.&#13;
C. Energy Consumption&#13;
1.10       Consumption of final commercial energy in the economy in 1993 is accounted for by the&#13;
following sectors: (a) transport for 39%; (b) industrial for 31 %; (c) residential and commercial (R&amp;C)&#13;
for 24%; and (d) other for 6%. Energy consumption during 1986-93 grew at an annual average of&#13;
8.8% with transport growing at an annual average of about 11.8%, followed by industry at 11.4%,&#13;
agriculture at 5.4%, and the R&amp;C sectors at 2.9%. The high consumption of the transport sector is&#13;
basically due to inadequate mass transport systems and severe traffic congestion in the metropolis.&#13;
Within the industrial sector, the manufacturing subsector, particularly food and beverage, accounted for&#13;
the bulk of energy consumption growth. Residential energy use represents about 77 % of the total R&amp;C&#13;
sector of which 90% is consumed by the urban population. Although the rate of rural electrification is&#13;
high, woodfuel (mostly wood and charcoal) continues to be the main cooking fuel in the countryside.&#13;
1.11       The power sector in Thailand has grown at a rapid pace over the past two decades.&#13;
Considerable progress has been made in making electricity widely available, especially in provincial&#13;
urban areas. Industrial consumption has also been growing rapidly. Overall, growth in power demand&#13;
has consistently exceeded that of commercial energy consumption. This has resulted in a per capita&#13;
electricity consumption in Thailand (about 970 kWh in 1993) higher than the average for countries at an&#13;
income level similar to Thailand. Similar trends are expected to prevail in the future as the country's&#13;
industrial and socio-economic development accelerates.&#13;
D. Organization and Planning&#13;
1.12       The energy sector in Thailand is operated by a number of well-managed and mature public&#13;
institutions. Their inter- and intra-sectoral arrangements are quite sophisticated and the policy&#13;
framework is extensive. There are numerous energy-related agencies, spreading across many ministries&#13;
and include several cabinet level committees. The relationships between Government energy agencies&#13;
and state energy enterprises are increasingly similar to those of other advanced East Asian countries; the&#13;
agencies formulate energy policies in line with the enterprises' commercial objectives, yet these are&#13;
consistent with the country's needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
1.13       The Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) -- the dominant entity in the petroleum sector&#13;
-- is involved in downstream oil and gas activities; upstream activities are carried out by the private&#13;
sector. PTT is responsible, inter alia, for the purchase, transport, processing and sale of natural gas.&#13;
However, PTT competes with international oil companies and has a third of the market share in the&#13;
distribution and marketing of oil. The power sector is organized around three state enterprises: EGAT&#13;
is responsible for generating and transmitting electricity and producing and utilizing lignite, while the&#13;
Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) are&#13;
responsible for power distribution in the Bangkok metropolitan area and the rest of the country,&#13;
respectively. Highlights of the operations of EGAT, MEA and PEA are included in Annex 1.&#13;
1.14       Energy policy and planning is vested in key governmental organizations. At the highest&#13;
level is the National Energy Policy Council (NEPC) which is chaired by the Prime Minister. Its&#13;
members include the deputy prime minister, ministers whose portfolio involve energy, and&#13;
representatives from the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB), the secretary&#13;
general of the National Energy Policy Office (NEPO), the director general of the Energy Development&#13;
Promotion Department (EDPD), and the director of the Budget Bureau. The NEPO, which is the&#13;
secretariat to NEPC and acts as its operating arm, functions primarily as a link between NEPC and the&#13;
country's state energy enterprises and conducts all energy policy work. The NESDB is a central&#13;
planning agency that assesses the country's economy and prepares the five-year plans. The various&#13;
departments involved in energy affairs are: (a) the Department of Mineral Resources, responsible for&#13;
assessing and preliminary exploration of the country's coal and petroleum reserves; (b) the Department&#13;
of Energy Development and Promotion, which was recently established to assume responsibilities of the&#13;
now-defunct National Energy Administration, responsible for conducting research and development and&#13;
monitoring energy sector activities; and (c) the Department of Industrial Works, responsible for&#13;
controlling industrial air and water pollution.&#13;
1.15       State enterprises engaged in the energy sector enjoy a large degree of autonomy in the&#13;
conduct of day-to-day operations; however, they are subject to strict government control in all matters&#13;
related to investment planning and financing. Because of strict procedures for controlling public debt,&#13;
all loans made by public enterprises requiring government guarantee must be approved by the National&#13;
Debt Policy Committee and by the Cabinet, and subsequently endorsed by the Fiscal Policy Office&#13;
(FPO) of the Ministry of Finance. Moreover, in 1985 a National State Enterprise Committee was&#13;
appointed under the Prime Minister to monitor compliance by public enterprises with government&#13;
guidelines in the area of pricing. While many of these state energy enterprises still lack financial&#13;
discipline and autonomy or suffer from labor redundancy and cumbersome personnel policies, this is&#13;
not the case with PTT and EGAT. Both these enterprises are in the process of undergoing a major&#13;
restructuring of their organization through corporatization, with a view to a partial or full privatization.&#13;
E. Environment&#13;
1.16       In 1992, the Government revised its National Environmental Act, reorganizing the Office&#13;
of the National Environment Board (NEB), and establishing NEB as a cabinet-level committee chaired&#13;
by the Prime Minister. The Act established three department-level organizations that report directly to&#13;
the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment (MOSTE).&#13;
These are the Office of Environmental Policy and Planning (OEPP), the Department of Pollution&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
Control (DPC) and the Department of Environmental Quality Promotion (DEQP).   The Act&#13;
strengthened public's right to be informed and to participate in environmental matters and established an&#13;
NGO coordination unit to facilitate this. The Act also established an Environmental and Quality of Life&#13;
Development Fund (funded by surcharges on natural gas and petroleum products) to finance&#13;
environment protection programs of private industry, local authorities, NGOs and communities. About&#13;
Baht 550 million were used from this fund in 1993-94 for pollution control activities in Pattaya, Phuket&#13;
and Hadyai.&#13;
1.17       The OEPP is currently engaged in preparing a National Environmental Action Plan with&#13;
the guidance of a subcommittee established under the NEB. In the interim period, it has prepared a&#13;
Provincial Action Plan that identifies policies and measures for protecting the country's natural&#13;
resources and the environment. In regard to the energy sector, this plan: (a) lays out plans to control&#13;
pollution from vehicles and industry; (b) identifies areas of serious environmental concern and&#13;
establishes preventive and emergency measures to deal with their atmospheric pollution; (c) establishes&#13;
criteria and regulations to control pollution from burning lignite in industries; and (d) lays down&#13;
methods for monitoring ambient and emission levels and preparing an inventory of pollution sources.&#13;
Based on these plans, investments are being made in: (a) improving fuel quality to reduce emissions; (b)&#13;
building monitoring systems in the industrial estates; and (c) strengthening the monitoring capacity for&#13;
atmospheric pollution from Government entities such as EGAT.&#13;
1.18        The process for the approval of the Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) of projects&#13;
of public sector organizations, such as EGAT, was strengthened.  Particularly significant is the&#13;
appointment of an external "expert committee" (having representatives of affected ministries, academics,&#13;
and one member of the public, usually represented by an NGO), to review EIAs.&#13;
F. Energy Pricing&#13;
1.19       The current prices of all energy products in Thailand reflect their actual economic costs&#13;
except for lignite. In August 1991, the Government deregulated the price of all petroleum products&#13;
except liquified petroleum gas (LPG). In addition, the Oil Stabilization Fund, which was established by&#13;
the Government in 1974 as a mechanism to dampen the effect of large short-run movements in&#13;
international oil prices on retail product prices, was phased out.&#13;
1.20       Currently, the ex-refinery prices of oil are tied to the world market through periodic price&#13;
adjustments based on the Singapore spot-market price. Except for a small surcharge levied on imported&#13;
oil products to protect domestic refiners, the domestically-refined petroleum price structure fully reflects&#13;
the cost of supply based on the international market. In 1993, the Government allowed EGAT to&#13;
purchase 20% of its oil on the open market, on a trial basis. PTT was successful in the tender process&#13;
and currently has long-term contracts with EGAT to supply virtually all of the heavy oil for five of&#13;
EGAT's power plants at market-based prices.&#13;
1.21       The unique features of the domestic gas industry in Thailand have led to the development&#13;
of a relatively sophisticated pricing structure in which the country has a separate pricing system for gas&#13;
producers and consumers. The principle the Government applies when setting consumer prices is to&#13;
link gas prices to alternative fuel prices in each activity. The present price of gas to industry, which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
consumes less than 6% of the total, is intended to encourage LPG consumers to shift to gas; but, no&#13;
such incentive is provided to fuel oil users, because gas has a lower netback value when substituted for&#13;
fuel oil. The price to industry is significantly higher than the one established for the power sector,&#13;
since the margin of substitution between LPG and gas has been high, even after a discount to allow for&#13;
penetration of gas into the LPG market. The price to the power sector, where over 90% of total gas is&#13;
used, is based on the price paid by PTT to upstream producers, the average cost of gas transmission,&#13;
and the VAT.&#13;
1.22       Lignite is not traded internationally due to its low heat content and high transport costs.&#13;
Its price in the industrial sector is determined by market forces, and in the power sub-sector, where&#13;
EGAT plays the role of supplier and consumer, the price is reflected in a "transfer price" used for'&#13;
planning purposes to analyze expansion investment decisions.&#13;
G. Energy Conservation&#13;
1.23       Concerned with the rapid growth in energy consumption and its impact on the economy&#13;
and the environment, the Government is fostering energy conservation in all sectors of the economy. In&#13;
1992, the Government approved legislation establishing the Energy Conservation Promotion Act, which&#13;
increased the commitment and resources necessary to implement a comprehensive energy efficiency&#13;
program. The Act: (a) formalized the responsibilities of the Department of Energy Development and&#13;
Promotion (DEDP) as the lead implementation agency for energy conservation; (b) gave DEDP the&#13;
authority to issue voluntary building energy codes and appliance efficiency standards; (c) identified a&#13;
class of large energy users as "controlled facilities" and required that they hire energy managers,&#13;
conduct energy studies and develop energy conservation plans, or face large financial penalties; and (d)&#13;
established the Energy Conservation Promotion Fund (ECF), financed through taxes on refinery&#13;
products. The ECF will fund energy conservation, renewable energy and cogeneration projects as well&#13;
as support training, technical assistance, promotion, monitoring and evaluation, research and&#13;
demonstration, technology transfer, and related activities that improve environmental conditions.&#13;
1.24       The Government has established an Industrial Process Efficiency Program to be managed&#13;
by DEDP and implemented by the Energy Conservation Center of Thailand (ECCT), with a budget of&#13;
US$30 million and a savings potential of 30 MW and 220 GWh (per annum) by 1997.&#13;
1.25       To foster electricity conservation through appropriate pricing policies, the Government has&#13;
restructured and increased electricity tariffs in 1991 so that the average tariffs for all consumer classes,&#13;
except residential, are practically equal to long-run marginal cost. Demand charges are levied for all&#13;
medium and large general service consumers, while time-of-use (TOU) tariffs are mandatory for large&#13;
general service consumers and optional for those that are small. The introduction of TOU tariffs has&#13;
had limited success because it has been hampered by the lack of an adequate tariff structure to&#13;
distribution companies, which do not pay demand charges to EGAT.&#13;
Demand Side Management&#13;
1.26       In 1992, a Demand Side Management (DSM) master plan was approved by NEPC, having&#13;
an initial five-year program with a budget of US$189 million and a modest savings target of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
approximately 238 MW, 1,427 GWh per year. Potentially, DSM could reduce peak demand by 2,000&#13;
MW over the next decade, which is a reduction of about 8% of the system needs. The program's&#13;
objectives would be achieved by: (a) providing user and manufacturer incentives and consumer&#13;
education to influence practices and attitudes towards energy-efficient technologies; (b) developing&#13;
efficiency standards and testing capabilities to exercise control and monitor efficiency improvements; (c)&#13;
developing and promulgating building and appliance codes so as to enforce minimum efficiency&#13;
standards; and (d) pursuing technological improvements and their adaptation to Thai conditions. The&#13;
program's potential benefits are estimated at about US$260 million in capital investment and US$30&#13;
million per year in fuel expenses.  EGAT has been charged with the primary responsibility for&#13;
implementing the DSM program (see Annex 2 for details).&#13;
H. Privatization in the Power Sector&#13;
1.27       Over the last decade, the Government has looked to privatization as a means of reducing&#13;
public sector borrowing and increasing enterprise efficiency.  It has reduced the number of state&#13;
enterprises from about 100 to 63, and has made a concerted effort to involve the private sector in state&#13;
enterprises through the partial sale of shares, private participation in the enterprises, contracting out of&#13;
services, and joint ventures.  The Bank's operational involvement in the Thai power sector has&#13;
facilitated continuing inputs to its privatization process. Under Bank advice, and as a first step towards&#13;
commercialization, an organizational efficiency study of EGAT was conducted by consultants. EGAT&#13;
organization is currently being restructured in line with the study's recommendations. In September&#13;
1992, the Government approved a plan for deregulation, restructuring, and privatization of the power&#13;
subsector. At the center of the structure would be a corporatized EGAT which, while continuing to be&#13;
a major power producer, would purchase electricity from independent power producers (IPPs) and&#13;
neighboring countries, and transmit and sell it to the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA), the&#13;
Provincial Power Authority (PEA) and major industrial users. The regulator of the subsector would be&#13;
the National Energy Policy Office (NEPO).&#13;
1.28       The conceptual framework of the government policy and the steps of its privatization&#13;
master plan for the subsector are as follows:&#13;
Step 1:    (a) Deregulate EGAT subject to its meeting the following criteria for "Good State&#13;
Enterprise": (i) ability to remit 30% of its net profit to the Government; (ii) labor&#13;
cost not to exceed 20% of total assets; (iii) no less than 6% rate of return on total&#13;
revalued assets; (iv) improvement in productivity by at least 2% per annum; (b)&#13;
Place the buying and selling of electricity among EGAT, MEA and PEA, and fuel&#13;
purchasing on a commercial contractual basis; (c) Sell 51% of the stock of the&#13;
Electricity Generating Company (EGCO) (see para. 1.36); and (d) Eliminate the&#13;
uniform tariff policy.&#13;
Step 2:    (a) Encourage private sector participation, including IPPs and EGCO, in power&#13;
generation investment following the steps specified in the Private Sector&#13;
Participation in State-Owned Activities Act of 1992; (b) Identify the proportion and&#13;
projects available for private sector investment; (c) Commercialize EGAT's&#13;
operations by its decentralization and restructuring into business units; (d) Prepare&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
for the deregulation of MEA and PEA; (e) Restructure PEA on a regional basis;&#13;
and (f) Implement electricity tariff based on marginal cost for each region.&#13;
Step 3:    (a) Corporatize EGAT, MEA and PEA by amending their related acts; (b) Register&#13;
EGAT as a public company on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET); and (c)&#13;
Invite IPPs to actually participate in power generation investment.&#13;
Step 4:    (a) Sell EGAT shares on the SET with the Government retaining majority holding;&#13;
and (b) Separate PEA into regional companies in preparation for its privatization.&#13;
1.29       The plan is expected to be completed by 1997/98. The progress of the privatization&#13;
exercise and timetable is presented in Annex 3. EGCO was listed on the stock exchange in January&#13;
1995. EGAT is expected to achieve "Good State Enterprise" status by June 1995. It has already&#13;
signed contracts with 20 small IPPs for an aggregate capacity of 210 MW, finalized comprehensive&#13;
documents for contracting 3,800 MW of capacity over 1995-2003 and expects to receive IPP proposals&#13;
for the first 1,000 MW by June 1995. It is expected that the proposed framework would attract IPPs,&#13;
as evidenced by the interest shown by dozens of IPPs at a recent seminar conducted by EGAT and the&#13;
Government. The Government has already undertaken on a road show for soliciting private power&#13;
finance.&#13;
1.30       The privatization framework and implementation steps that the Government has proposed&#13;
for the power sector are well planned and well tailored to the circumstances in Thailand. Privatization&#13;
is now on a steady path and its pace is being accelerated. The Government has deftly resolved serious&#13;
opposition from the unions to corporatization of the power sector entities. The Government has shown&#13;
keen interest in associating the Bank in its privatization efforts across the board by: (a) requesting the&#13;
Bank to undertake a comprehensive review of privatization of its state enterprises (Bank's Report No.&#13;
1312-TH, "Increasing Private Participation and Improving Efficiency in State Enterprises"); and (b)&#13;
conducting seminars to discuss privatization issues between highest levels in the Bank and the&#13;
Government, including the Prime Minister. In regard to the power sector, the Bank has recommended&#13;
several measures to enhance competition, notably: in the near term: (a) EGCO to be fully divested and&#13;
its management made independent of EGAT; and (b) accelerate the pace of introducing IPPs; in the&#13;
longer term: (a) divest EGAT into a number of generation companies, with EGAT becoming a&#13;
transmission and power pool company; and (b) distribution companies and large industrial consumers to&#13;
be allowed to purchase directly from any power producer. The Government is receptive to the Bank's&#13;
suggestions and would solicit Bank's assistance in working out details as the privatization program&#13;
proceeds.&#13;
Promotion of Small Power Producers&#13;
1.31       The first step taken by the Government towards increasing private sector participation was&#13;
allowing cogenerators and small power producers to sell power to EGAT. Cogenerators are power&#13;
plants that produce both steam and electricity and are often part of industrial estates. Small power&#13;
producers are plants that sell less than 60 MW to EGAT. At present, there are 20 small power&#13;
producers with a total installed capacity of 669 MW mostly utilizing traditional fuels such as bagasse,&#13;
rice husk, wood, etc. EGAT has signed nine contracts totalling about 200 MW with these producers&#13;
and five have actually sold their output to EGAT in 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
Independent Power Producers (IPPs)&#13;
1.32       The Government has taken necessary steps to encourage IPPs to invest, own and operate&#13;
large-scale power plants, as well as sell their output to EGAT. The IPPs are expected to bid for&#13;
EGAT's new capacity requirement or new power projects in EGAT's PDP.&#13;
1.33       An open invitation to bid to produce power is underway following the recent approval by&#13;
NEPC in May 1994 for the purchase of electricity from IPPs by EGAT in stages as follows: (a) 1,000&#13;
MW for 1996-2000; (b) 2,800 MW for 2001-2002; and (c) 1,700 MW in each year from 2003 to 2006.&#13;
A public seminar was organized in August 1994 to solicit comments from prospective bidders; several&#13;
have already expressed their intentions to compete for IPP licenses. Bid invitations are expected to be&#13;
announced by June 1995. For projects to be commissioned in the initial stage (1996-2000), the IPP&#13;
bids need to be submitted before the end of March 1995. Invitation for specific projects, meanwhile,&#13;
will also be issued.&#13;
1.34       IPP projects are expected to have a capacity of 100 MW or more. The projects will be&#13;
promoted by the Board of Investments and given various incentives such as tax breaks of up to eight&#13;
years and exemption from the machinery import tax. The Government is expected to impose minimum&#13;
conditions on private investment in the power subsector and will evaluate IPPs on the various criteria&#13;
that include, among others, the type of energy that will be used to generate electricity.&#13;
Electricity Generating Company (EGCO)&#13;
1.35       One of the early initiatives undertaken by the Government in line with the privatization&#13;
master plan was the establishment of EGCO, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EGAT, which listed 51 % of&#13;
its share in the SET. The reduction of EGAT's shareholding in EGCO to 49% by offering shares to&#13;
the general public in both domestic and international equity markets was the first major privatization of&#13;
an electricity generating business in Thailand.&#13;
1.36       In March 1992, the National Assembly passed an amendment to the EGAT Act allowing&#13;
EGAT to establish EGCO, and consultants were hired to assist EGCO in optimizing its capital&#13;
structure, determining the logistics of privatization, pricing and timing of both equity and debt issues,&#13;
drafting of EGCO's primary contracts, and the organization and staffing plan. The consultant's report,&#13;
finalized in December 1992, proposed the sale of the Rayong combined cycle power plant by EGAT.&#13;
A second stage of the consultancy worked on the actual underwriting of both stock and bonds of EGCO&#13;
(see Annex 3 for more information on EGCO).&#13;
I. Energy Sector Issues and Strategy&#13;
1.37       The issues facing the energy sector and the Government's strategy in meeting the&#13;
challenges posed are summarized hereunder:&#13;
(a)   A huge program of investments in the power subsector over the next six years - US$14&#13;
billion by EGAT, US$4.0 billion by PEA and US$2.0 billion by MEA - would greatly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
increase public sector debt. In response, the Government is taking necessary measures to&#13;
involve the private sector in funding power projects (paras. 1.27 to 1.33).&#13;
(b)   Thailand's domestic resources for power generation are limited. Natural gas is fully&#13;
committed, lignite poses technical and environmental problems, while hydropower&#13;
development invites strong protests from dam opponents. Thailand would thus need to&#13;
rely heavily on imported energy for power generation, and for this it has several options,&#13;
including piped natural gas from Malaysia and Myanmar, liquified natural gas (LNG)&#13;
from the international market, coal from the Pacific rim countries and hydro power from&#13;
Laos.  The Bank's 1993 Fuel Option Study (Report No 11948-TH) analyzes these&#13;
prospects in depth, and in the coming years the Bank expects to assist the Government in&#13;
firming up its fuel choices.&#13;
(c)   While pursuing a large power development program, the Government needs to pay serious&#13;
attention to improving the efficiency of energy consumption in general and electricity&#13;
consumption in particular. Its: (a) 1992 Energy Conservation Promotion Act and the&#13;
associated Energy Conservation Fund (para. 1.23); and (b) the DSM Master Plan (para.&#13;
1.26) provide a strong thrust in this direction.&#13;
(d)  In recent years, the Government has placed a strong emphasis on environmentally sound&#13;
and sustainable development as evidenced from its Environmental Quality Act of 1992&#13;
(para. 1. 16).  Gaining from  its experience under the Bank's Third Power System&#13;
Development Project (Loan 3423-TH), the Government has increasingly emphasized&#13;
involvement of affected people and selected NGOs in environmentally sensitive projects&#13;
and formalized this in the evaluation of EIAs. In regard to atmospheric emissions from&#13;
power plants, the Government has decided to fit (and retrofit as appropriate) flue gas&#13;
desulfirizers on lignite-fired thermal power units and use low sulfur oil (costing 20%&#13;
more) in oil fired thermal power units. It has also introduced stringent short-term SO2&#13;
ambient standards to safeguard the health of the people, especially in the vicinity of the&#13;
Mae Moh mining-power complex.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter II&#13;
The Power Subsector&#13;
A. The Power Market&#13;
2.1        The electricity market has grown at a very rapid pace over the past two decades. Total&#13;
sales of electricity and per capita consumption increased from 17,563 GWh and 355 kWh, respectively,&#13;
in 1983 to about 56,558 GWh and 979 kWh in 1993, averaging a growth rate of 12.4% p.a. (compared&#13;
to an average GDP growth rate of 8.6%). Over the years, the industrial sector has become the major&#13;
electricity consumer, accounting for 46% of electricity sales in FY93.  This is followed by the&#13;
commercial sector (32%) and the residential sector (21%). EGAT's daily load curves which have&#13;
shown a pronounced evening peak until about 1990, have started demonstrating an increasing day time&#13;
peak from 1992 to 1993, showing that considerable changes are taking place in the structure of&#13;
electricity use in Thailand. The DSM program (paras. 1.25 and 1.26) will address the issues&#13;
concerning the magnitude and shape of EGAT's load curve.&#13;
2.2        A sharp upsurge in economic activity in the late 1980s (GDP growth was 13.3% in FY88,&#13;
12.2% in FY89 and 11.6% in FY90) translated into very high growths in electricity demand (15% in&#13;
FY88, 14.5% in FY89 and 13.8% in FY90). The demand growth rates slowed to 13.4% in FY91,&#13;
10.3% in FY92 and 9.6% in FY93. The latest load forecast (detailed in Annex 4 and summarized in&#13;
Table 2.1), as developed by the National Load Forecast Working Group (composed inter alia of&#13;
NESDB, EGAT, MEA, PEA and NEA) envisages a 9.5% growth rate in electricity generation over the&#13;
1993-98 period. This growth rate is commensurate with the forecast rate of economic development and&#13;
is considered to be reasonable. The growth rates are moderated to below 7.0% p.a. over 1998-2003.&#13;
These projections have been endorsed by the Government as providing a suitable basis for planning&#13;
purposes.&#13;

B. Generation and Transmission Facilities&#13;
2.3        As of September 1993, EGAT's installed capacity was approximately 12,178.3 MW with&#13;
another 2,018 MW under construction. Generating facilities (Annex 5) consist of conventional thermal&#13;
plants (50%), hydropower (20%), combined-cycle plants (28%) and combustion turbines (2%). Over&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
the years, EGAT has converted most of its oil-based thermal capacity (6,102 MW) to dual oil/gas firing&#13;
to take advantage of the increasing availability of natural gas while maintaining the option to switch&#13;
over to oil. Other thermal plants include lignite-fired units (2,059 MW) and the remaining oil-fired&#13;
units (4,043 MW).&#13;
2.4        EGAT's transmission facilities are tabulated in Annex 6. In addition to the construction of&#13;
transmission lines and substations required to evacuate the output of new generation plants, EGAT is&#13;
progressively developing a transmission system to serve various areas of the country. At present,&#13;
EGAT operates 20,005 circuit-kilometers (ckm) of transmission lines, including 1,201 ckm constructed&#13;
for 500 kV.&#13;
C. Power Development Plan&#13;
2.5        EGAT has fully computerized the formulation of its power development plan (PDP) using&#13;
the WIGPLAN model. It regularly updates the PDP in response to changes in demand growth, fuel&#13;
availability and price, and earliest possible commissioning dates of candidate generating plants. Its&#13;
latest power development plan (presented in Annexes 7, 8 and 9) does not take into account availability&#13;
of piped gas from Malaysia or Myanmar, import of gas in the form of LNG or import of hydro power&#13;
from Laos. Although these prospective sources are under Government's active consideration, no firm&#13;
decisions have yet been taken. EGAT would consider these sources in its development plan as soon as&#13;
firm contract arrangements for supply have been negotiated. Of note in this PDP, as compared to&#13;
previous PDPs, are: (a) the introduction of a 300 MW fluidized bed combustion unit for the first time&#13;
in EGAT's system; (b) the use of low (0.5%) sulfur oil (at about 20% higher cost) in oil-fired units; (c)&#13;
deferment of expansion at Lampang (Mae Moh) to 2001 and use of wet flue gas desulfurizers on all&#13;
lignite-fired units; (e) absence of development of lignite-fired units at Saba Yoi due to political reasons;&#13;
(e) deferment of imported coal fired units for environmental reasons and specification of dual fuel&#13;
(oil/coal) for these plants; (f) strengthening of the interconnection between the Thai and Malaysian grids&#13;
to 300 MW using HVDC (this link would be upgraded later); and (g) very modest hydropower (447&#13;
MW) development due to environmental considerations. Table 2.2 summarizes the aggregate capacity&#13;
additions up to the year 2003. This indicates: (a) a substantial addition of gas-fired combined-cycle&#13;
capacity up to 1998 when current gas reserves would be fully committed; (b) a substantial lignite-based&#13;
development most of which would be towards the latter part of the century; (c) a fairly large imported&#13;
coal/oil-fired capacity; (d) a mix of pump storage and internal combustion turbine peaking capacity; (e)&#13;
a modest development of hydro power; and (f) no addition of oil/gas-fired or fuel oil-fired capacity.&#13;

2.6         The shares of various types of fuel in electricity generation are expected to move as&#13;
follows (Annex 9): (a) hydropower -- declining from the 1994 level of 5.3% to 4.7% by 2003; (b)&#13;
natural gas -- increasing to a peak level of 45.9% by 1994 and then declining to 42.4% by 2003; (c)&#13;
fuel oil -- remaining at a level of about 29.5% until 1998 and thereafter declining to about 5.6% by&#13;
2003; (d) lignite -- increasing from the current level of 19. 1 % to 22.0% by 2003; and (e) imported coal&#13;
-- starting from 2000 and reaching a level of 24.6% by 2003. The fuel mix would change significantly&#13;
towards the latter part of the century if import of piped natural gas from Myanmar and Malaysia and/or&#13;
hydropower from Laos and Myanmar are taken into consideration. These potential developments are&#13;
currently not taken into account in EGAT's planning process, but would soon be in the future, subject&#13;
to firming up of import opportunities for natural gas and hydropower. Likewise, savings due to DSM&#13;
would be integrated in the planning process, as such savings become significant over the years.&#13;
2.7         EGAT's transmission program is aimed at extending high voltage 230 kV and 115 kV&#13;
transmission facilities to all provinces of Thailand by the mid-1990s. The extra high voltage 500 kV&#13;
transmission system, which is superimposed on the 230 kV system, is required for bulk power&#13;
transmission to accommodate the large-scale development of lignite-fired power plants at Mae Moh.&#13;
EGAT's transmission development plan, shown in Table 2.3, is reasonable.&#13;
2.8         Overall, EGAT's PDP is appropriate to the present circumstances. Project supervision&#13;
would provide the Bank with an opportunity to review regular updates of EGAT's PDP to monitor the&#13;
impact of changes in power demand and fuel supply scenarios on the composition and magnitude of&#13;
power investments. Agreement was reached at negotiations that EGAT will carry out an annual review&#13;
and update of its 5-year investment program and related financing plan and exchange views with the&#13;
Bank and the Government on the said program.&#13;

D. Past Bank Experience and Sector Strategy&#13;
Experience with Past Loans&#13;
2.9         The Bank has made 22 loans to Thailand for power, of which 17 have been made to&#13;
EGAT and its predecessor for financing the expansion of electricity generation and transmission&#13;
facilities, four to PEA for rural electrification, and one to MEA for distribution expansion. Of the 17&#13;
loans to EGAT, 13 have been fully disbursed; the other two are progressing on schedule. Three loans&#13;
to PEA have been fully disbursed and one is progressing satisfactorily. The loan to MEA is also&#13;
progressing satisfactorily.&#13;
2.10       In the last several years, EGAT completed five Bank-financed projects for power&#13;
generation: Bang Pakong Thermal (Loan 1690-TH) and Khao Laem Hydro (Loan 1770-TH) in 1985,&#13;
Pattani Hydro (Loan 1485-TH) in 1983, Power Subsector (Loan 2000-TH) in 1987, and Power System&#13;
Development (Loan 3027-TH) in 1992. The corresponding project completion reports and project&#13;
performance audit reports highlight EGAT's financial recovery following the oil price increases of the&#13;
early 1980s from a -2% rate of return on revalued assets in FY79 to 7.5% in FY91, the maturity of the&#13;
Bank's operational and policy dialogue with the power sector, and EGAT's proven project&#13;
implementation and financial track record. These projects were completed on schedule and within the&#13;
appraisal cost estimates with three minor exceptions: (a) the Khao Laem Hydro project was 12 months&#13;
behind schedule and had a 4% cost overrun because of unexpected complications in civil works; (b) the&#13;
Power Subsector project, was completed 15 months late and 51% under the appraisal project cost&#13;
estimate because inflation assumptions used to project contingencies were higher than actual increases,&#13;
and because one component of the project was canceled; and (c) the Power System Development&#13;
project, was completed 12 months late due to adverse weather conditions and a shortage of cement in&#13;
the country which resulted in a delay in the commissioning of one project component.&#13;
2.11       Three main lessons have been learnt from the Bank's previous and ongoing projects with&#13;
EGAT. First: the need for thorough investigations of geological conditions and provision of adequate&#13;
contingencies for civil works for hydro projects; Second: the need for involvement of: (a) relevant&#13;
people and agencies in project design; (b) affected people in designing the compensation scheme; (c)&#13;
external experts in reviewing project EIAs; and (d) affected persons in oversight committees; and Third:&#13;
the need for providing adequate reserves in cost estimates for environmental impact mitigation and&#13;
compensation.  These lessons have been fully applied in the design of the proposed project. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
particular, extensive field testing has been undertaken to establish the soundness of the site's geological&#13;
conditions.&#13;
2.12        Bank participation in the power subsector has helped EGAT to develop into a technically&#13;
competent and efficient power utility. The Bank's associations with PEA and MEA are oriented&#13;
towards achieving major institutional improvements and fostering energy efficiency.  Through its&#13;
continuing dialogue with the subsector institutions, the Bank has been instrumental in the&#13;
implementation of adequate overall electricity tariff levels, ensuring the sector's financial soundness and&#13;
the cost effectiveness of power generation investments. Bank-sponsored sector work in investment&#13;
planning and energy pricing also represented significant contributions towards improving sector&#13;
coordination. Overall, the Bank's presence in the power subsector has helped ensure that utilities were&#13;
soundly managed and has encouraged other lenders to provide investment financing for the subsector on&#13;
favorable terms.&#13;
2.13        In the lignite mining subsector, the Bank has made two loans to EGAT to finance the&#13;
development of the Mae Moh mine. The first loan (Loan 1852-TH), which financed expansion of&#13;
production capacity from 1 million tpa to 2.8 million tpa, was closed in April 1988 and a Project&#13;
Completion Report (PCR) has been prepared. The second loan (Loan 2407-TH), supporting further&#13;
expansion of production capacity to 5 million tpa, closed April 30, 1991. Through these two projects&#13;
EGAT received substantial technical assistance that has led to improved capabilities in all aspects of&#13;
mining operations, including the exploration for and evaluation of lignite reserves in other parts of the&#13;
country. Establishment of a mine accounting system separate from accounts for power operations and&#13;
the carrying out of a lignite pricing study have enabled the monitoring of costs and establishment of an&#13;
internal lignite pricing formula based on appropriate transfer price agreed with the Bank. The charge to&#13;
EGAT for lignite is made at an economic transfer price reflecting long-run marginal cost of lignite,&#13;
which is the sum of EGAT's mining costs and a depletion premium that accounts for the increasing&#13;
economic scarcity value of lignite and the associated cost to the economy of the early use of an&#13;
exhaustible resource.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.14        Through sustained involvement over a number of years, the Bank has contributed&#13;
significantly to the development of the Thai energy sector. With a modest level of lending, the Bank&#13;
has been able to exercise significant policy leverage. Bank advice and assistance have helped the&#13;
Government effectively address the issues of: (a) least-cost investment planning, particularly with regard&#13;
to fuel choices; (b) supply- and demand- side management and resource pricing; (c) power sector&#13;
restructuring and privatization; (d) environmental reforms; and (e) participatory development.&#13;
However, further work remains to be done in actual implementation of the proposed sector strategies.&#13;
The project is expected to make a significant contribution in reforming the tariff structure and&#13;
strengthening the environmental capabilities of the power sector's dominant entity. In its formulation&#13;
itself, the project has provided an opportunity for putting into practice the policy for involvement of&#13;
affected persons in rehabilitation/compensation and the Bank expects to supervise this process closely&#13;
during implementation. In addition to its inputs through specific sector work, the Bank's continuing&#13;
operational involvement in the Thai power sector is essential to exercise significant influence on&#13;
Government policies towards evolution of the sector in an economically efficient, financially sound and&#13;
environmentally sustainable manner, and for its orderly progress towards reform, restructuring and&#13;
privatization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
2.15       The policies and programs pursued by the Government in the power sector are in&#13;
compliance with the Bank's policies and guidelines. The project is also consistent with the Bank's&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, Report No. 13458-TH). As discussed in the CAS, which was&#13;
presented to the Board on September 22, 1994, Bank's support to Thailand aims at providing value&#13;
added in terms of helping Thailand address the most important long-term development issues. Among&#13;
the priority areas for Bank assistance identified in the CAS are development of the physical&#13;
infrastructure and improvement in environmental management to which this project would contribute.&#13;
Rationalization of the bulk supply tariff would facilitate power sector restructuring and privatization.&#13;
Strengthening EGAT's environmental capabilities and improving the process of consultation with&#13;
affected communities, would upgrade the framework for environmental management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter III&#13;
The Borrower&#13;
A. Organization and Management&#13;
3.1          EGAT is wholly-owned by the Kingdom of Thailand and comes under the direct&#13;
supervision of the Office of the Prime Minister. According to its Act, it is responsible for: (a)&#13;
constructing and operating dams and reservoirs; (b) constructing and operating thermal, hydro, nuclear&#13;
and other types of power plants; (c) improving and expanding substation and transmission systems; (d)&#13;
specifying standards, types and sizes for substations, transmission systems, power plants and lignite&#13;
plants, and fuel for power production; and (e) formulating policy in connection with power production&#13;
and sale of electricity, lignite and other by-products.&#13;
3.2          EGAT enjoys broad autonomy in managing its day-to-day affairs but matters relating to&#13;
planning, budgeting, pricing, and financing of investments are subject to Government approval.&#13;
Nevertheless, EGAT's management exercises substantial influence on Government's decisions in these&#13;
matters.&#13;
3.3          EGAT has grown rapidly into a large organization with a sound structural system. At&#13;
present, there are 11 members of the Board of Directors headed by a chairman. Of the 11 members of&#13;
the Board, 10 are appointed by the Council of Ministers. The main functions of the Board are to set up&#13;
policy and give advice to EGAT's top executives. The General Manager, who is not appointed, sits in&#13;
the Board as one of the directors. He is responsible for implementing the Board's decisions and for day-&#13;
to-day management. With the exception of the General Manager, all directors who represent government&#13;
interests and the private sector, act in a part-time capacity. The Internal Auditor is not a member of the&#13;
Board but may at his own initiative express his opinions at any of the Board meetings. All Board&#13;
members have a three year term.&#13;
3.4          The present management of EGAT comprises of a General Manager, eight deputy general&#13;
managers and 15 assistant general managers. The deputy general managers are responsible directly for&#13;
organizational management of eight divisions:   Policy and Planning; Account and Finance;&#13;
Administration; Construction; Transmission System Operation; Mining; Power Plant and Operation; and&#13;
Engineering. Divisional responsibilities are broken down into departments headed by assistant general&#13;
managers. The Internal Audit Department reports directly to the General Manager.&#13;
3.5          In order to increase operational efficiency, EGAT's organization structure (Chart 1) was&#13;
changed in November 1993 from a division of business activities according to type of plant, to one&#13;
according to function. As a result, managerial authority for power plant operations and certain functions&#13;
such as procurement, financing of investments up to certain approved limits, and recruitment of lower&#13;
level personnel were decentralized to the regions and provinces. However, core activities (power plant&#13;
and substation maintenance, chemical analysis, environment, etc.) remain under the central office. The&#13;
reorganization resulted in the creation of: (a) new groups for Construction, Mining and Engineering; (b)&#13;
new assistant general manager positions for the Mae Moh and the Bang Pakong Power Plants under the&#13;
Power Plant Operation Group; and (c) new departments under each assistant general manager (Demand&#13;
Side Management Office and Computer Office under the Policy and Planning Group, Solid Fuel&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
Exploration and Mae Moh Planning and Administration Department under the Mining Group, Mae Moh&#13;
Power and Bang Pakong Power Plant Maintenance under the Power Plant Operation Group, and&#13;
Development and Planning, Environment, and Civil Engineering under the Engineering Group).&#13;
3.6          EGAT's organization structure is still in transition. The current structure may be&#13;
modified again in FY95, following management's review of the results of two consulting studies&#13;
(described below) on EGAT's organization. Both studies have recommended a completely new,&#13;
decentralized type of organization when EGAT becomes a limited company. As the proposed structure&#13;
deviates considerably from the existing EGAT structure, the studies also recommended an intermediate&#13;
organizational model, reorganizing EGAT along business units, that could be readily introduced when&#13;
EGAT qualifies for GSE status. Both studies in the intermediate stage, propose the same structure and&#13;
differ only in the number of units that would be created. However, the long-run target organization&#13;
models differ in that one study proposes the creation of independent organizational units operating as&#13;
business, operative or service units, while the other proposes the creation of generation/transmission,&#13;
design and construction, maintenance, and subsidiary (for non-core business) companies.&#13;
EGAT Effciency Study&#13;
3.7          In 1991, EGAT engaged consultants to conduct an operational efficiency study in&#13;
connection with the Second Power System Development Project (Loan 3138-TH). The first phase (June-&#13;
December 1991) analyzed employee attitudes and satisfaction towards EGAT's operational circles,&#13;
through staff surveys and consultative meetings. The results showed that employees' satisfaction towards&#13;
EGAT's operational activities were of a moderately high level with staff giving high ratings for job&#13;
environment, inter-relationship, communication, and job function.   The study recommended&#13;
improvements in four priority areas: management, personnel development, staff welfare, and public&#13;
relations.&#13;
3.8          The second phase (October 1992-June 1993) covered eight studies in corporate planning,&#13;
system dispatch, organization, economic and financial systems, human resources and power system&#13;
planning. The main recommendations for actions in the short term were:  (a) introduce a new&#13;
decentralized type of organization which should be implemented as soon as EGAT is converted into a&#13;
"Good State Enterprise" (GSE); as an interim action an "Intermediate Organization" was also proposed;&#13;
(b) determine new financial corporate objectives by developing a concrete strategy for reduction of cost&#13;
and capital expenditure, tariff adjustments, etc.; (c) decentralize authorities and responsibilities when the&#13;
new organization is established to include higher decision-making authorities for all managers; (d)&#13;
strengthen the management information system; (e) substantially modify EGAT's present budget system;&#13;
(f) introduce market oriented salaries and benefits; (g) emphasize short-run marginal cost scheduling; and&#13;
(h) improve the suitable strategic planning process through which objectives are formulated, goals are set,&#13;
and actions are taken in the short-term. The final report of the study is now being reviewed by EGAT&#13;
management.&#13;
EGAT Privatization Study&#13;
3.9          In 1991, EGAT contracted the services of financial advisors to lay out a specific plan and&#13;
present recommendations to management for EGAT's privatization. Phase I of the study (June-November&#13;
1991) provided the background work and created EGAT privatization work teams. This phase concluded&#13;
with a privatization plan that was submitted by EGAT to the Government. The Government broadened&#13;
EGAT's recommendations and the plan, eventually, became the blueprint for the Government's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
privatization program. Phase II of the Study (May 1993-February 1994) produced recommendations and&#13;
associated action plans, including a new organizational structure to prepare for EGAT's corporatization&#13;
and eventual privatization. This phase also included a review and implementation plan of EGAT's tariffs,&#13;
fuel supply contract arrangements, IPP solicitation process, and the restructuring of EGAT into business&#13;
units. The consultants are now preparing their final report and recommendations to EGAT management.&#13;
B. Staffing and Training&#13;
3.10          EGAT's staff is professional and well-qualified. As of December 1993, EGAT employed&#13;
34,946 persons, 4,362 at various managerial levels and 29,892 non-managerial positions consisting of&#13;
engineers, accountants, technicians and administrative and other skilled workers. About 692 employees&#13;
are on temporary status. Three fourths of the staff are between the ages of 25 to 44. More than half of&#13;
the staff (62%) have received some form of higher education, with 19% being university graduates.&#13;
About 19% of staff are females and half of them have university degrees. EGAT's staff composition and&#13;
educational qualifications is presented in Table 3. 1.&#13;

3.11          EGAT has a current staffing ratio of 2.63 employees per MW installed and has budgeted&#13;
for staff numbers to rise by 3.1 % in 1995 due to the significant introduction of new plants. In line with&#13;
EGAT's goal of achieving GSE status, management intends to limit staff numbers to no more than 2.5&#13;
people per MW of installed capacity by October 1995. EGAT has a human resource program in place&#13;
to achieve reductions in staff numbers. The program, consisting of a generous compensation package&#13;
for early retirement, was approved in December 1993 and is being implemented to cover all non-technical&#13;
staff and target groups (excluding engineers). With this newly devised incentive and EGAT's normal&#13;
attrition rate, it expects to meet its targeted staffing ratio in FY95.&#13;
3.12          EGAT places considerable emphasis on strengthening of staff training to meet ongoing&#13;
structural changes in the power sub-sector and to enhance it own competitiveness.  The Training&#13;
Department is responsible for delivering effective training, managing human resources, and career&#13;
development. With a staff complement of 74 professionals and 223 support staff, it conducts training&#13;
activities in EGAT headquarters and three training centers at: (a) Bang Pakong, situated in the central&#13;
region, responsible for training in natural gas and oil fired thermal power plant operation and&#13;
maintenance, substation operation and maintenance, and simulator training; (b) Mae Moh in the north,&#13;
for training in lignite fired thermal power plant operation and maintenance, and simulator training; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
(c) Tha Thung Na in the west, for hydro power plant operation and maintenance training. From 1986-93,&#13;
a total of 93,573 staff received training for which EGAT spent a total of Baht 104.5 million.&#13;
3.13         EGAT's professional staff, 41%  of whom are engineers, is mostly recruited among&#13;
college graduates trained through in-house and external training courses as well as a system of rotational&#13;
assignments within EGAT. During the last year, 14,919 staff participated in 1,713 standard and specific&#13;
training programs designed by the Training Department. About two-thirds of staff were trained under&#13;
the standard program and a third under the specific program on technical subjects, quality control,&#13;
management, etc. Under the standard program, 86 technical courses (e.g. substation operation, digital&#13;
technology, power plant mechanical maintenance, etc.) and 80 non-technical courses (management and&#13;
leadership, project planning and control, computer literacy, and general work courses) were provided.&#13;
Under the specific programs, 11 technical courses and 55 non-technical courses were provided.&#13;
C. Operational Performance&#13;
3.14         At present, EGAT operates 131 units of various generating stations with a total capacity&#13;
of 12,626 MW; of which 19% is hydro; 48% conventional oil/gas and lignite-fired thermal; 31%&#13;
combined cycle; and 2 % gas turbine power plants. With a transmission line length of 20,005 circuit-km,&#13;
it has 173 substations and 26,351 MVA transformer capacity. EGAT has operated these facilities and&#13;
transmission network with high efficiency and reliability due to its good system maintenance as well as&#13;
its modem and well-equipped control centers. In 1992, EGAT inaugurated three new control centers&#13;
equipped with modern software and facilities including the Energy Management System (EMS),&#13;
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), Man-Machine Interface (MMI) System, and other&#13;
advanced communication systems financed under the Power System Development Project (Loan No.&#13;
3027-TH).&#13;
3.15         Power losses, including both transmission and generation losses, amount to about 9 % of&#13;
electricity produced, with estimated transmission losses being about 4% and auxiliary consumption being&#13;
5 % of generation. This level is consistent with previous years' levels. Network losses are relatively high&#13;
when compared to those recorded for the more developed power grids of countries such as South Korea&#13;
and Japan, but are reasonable in view of EGAT's large transmission system which is still under evolution.&#13;
3.16         EGAT is a well-run organization and is capable of managing substantial growth in&#13;
investment because of its strengths in project cost control, implementation and management. In March&#13;
1992, it received the Operations Management Award from the World Executive's Digest Second Annual&#13;
Asia Management Awards program. The award was given in recognition of EGAT's outstanding&#13;
achievement in raising production capacity in a short time, while maintaining a high standard of service.&#13;
EGAT has been a Bank borrower since 1957 and has been a recipient of 17 loans. The credit for the&#13;
successful execution of these Bank projects is due, in most part, to the skill and commitment of EGAT&#13;
staff in headquarters and at the project sites. The experiences it has gained through the years of&#13;
association with the Bank also contributed to its good project performance. EGAT is familiar with the&#13;
Bank's procurement guidelines and processes tenders and awards contracts equitably and expeditiously.&#13;

D. Financial Management&#13;
Accounting&#13;
3.17          EGAT keeps its accounts in accordance with practices of typical modern power utility&#13;
companies. Its accounting systems and procedures are efficient; transactions such as general ledgers,&#13;
payroll, inventory transactions, accounts payable, and accounts receivable are fully computerized. EGAT&#13;
prepares an annual budget for capital and operational expenditures and periodic reports to management&#13;
enabling comparison of actual against budgeted performance. EGAT has built up a competent and&#13;
professional accounting staff over the years.&#13;
3.18          The billing and collection system has been operating satisfactorily. EGAT's accounts&#13;
receivables represent amounts due from MEA, PEA and other large customers. For FY93, MEA and&#13;
PEA settled their September 1993 bill in November 1993, while a long standing receivable due from the&#13;
Sattahip Navy Station of Baht 61 million (relating to sales of electricity between January and August&#13;
1990) was finally received in October 1993. Accounts receivables have improved from an average of&#13;
76 days of sales in FY87 to 42 days in FY93, and reflects the efficiency and adequacy of EGAT's&#13;
operating system. The practice is also consistent with a Government regulation requiring all state&#13;
enterprises to collect receivables within 60 days.&#13;
3.19          EGAT has developed an on-line Management Information System. The system, which&#13;
has been in various stages of development since 1984 covers subsystems for personnel, system operation,&#13;
progress of projects, finance and budget, fuel price and economic tariff, procurement, PDP, financial and&#13;
economic projection, energy demand and supply, records and statistics, and executive information.&#13;
Although the various subsystems are in operation as independent subsystems, total integration is expected&#13;
in 1997 and implementation of the integrated system in 1998.&#13;
Audit&#13;
3.20          The Internal Audit Department continues to operate effectively reporting directly to the&#13;
General Manager. A number of operational and management audits, as well as routine audit work, are&#13;
carried out by the department with a staff of 92. The department reviews the accounts of each operating&#13;
unit throughout the year and prepares between four to five reports, including the year-end financial&#13;
statements, which are compiled by the Controller's Department. These reports include the financial audit&#13;
of accounts, fund account audit of the sinking and pension funds, a stock and inventory account audit,&#13;
an operational audit that reviews implementation of procurement contracts and compliance with&#13;
government regulations, and the newly instituted performance audit. The financial audit reports, which&#13;
are extensive in coverage, are reviewed by the department primarily for accuracy and compliance with&#13;
regulations of the Ministry of Finance. For all inventories, the department carries out test checks on&#13;
higher value items to ensure that the provisions are adequate. In 1993, the Deputy Prime Minister&#13;
required all state-owned enterprises to undertake regular management performance audits in line with the&#13;
Government's policy on divestiture. This audit, which will be conducted by EGAT's Internal Audit&#13;
Department in 1995, is a special audit that deals not only with purely financial issues but also with&#13;
operational aspects including internal procedures, management audits and efficiency improvement&#13;
measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
3.21         EGAT's accounts are audited annually by the Office of the Auditor General, the&#13;
government agency responsible for auditing all state enterprises. An international accounting firm&#13;
(Coopers and Lybrand) also acts as external auditors and has been retained as financial consultant,&#13;
cooperating with the Auditor General in issuing EGAT's annual accounts. Audit reports have never been&#13;
qualified since EGAT was established. The submission of the reports to the Bank has always been timely&#13;
and the performance of the external auditors has been satisfactory. The auditing arrangements are&#13;
satisfactory. As provided under previous Bank loans, agreement was reached that EGAT would submit&#13;
to the Bank audited financial statements for its mining operations and EGAT as a whole, within six&#13;
months of the close of each fiscal year.&#13;
Insurance&#13;
3.22         EGAT has adequate insurance coverage. Property insurance cover for EGAT is provided&#13;
by means of six insurance sinking funds valued as of September 30, 1993 at US$176 million (Baht 4.4&#13;
billion), the largest being the Power Plant Fund. These funds provide cover against risks of breakdown,&#13;
impact damage, explosion and fire, and special perils. A Good Claims Bonus is paid back to EGAT by&#13;
the Power Plant Fund and this is calculated according to a formula which takes into account the overall&#13;
size of the fund, the insurance risk and the estimated maximum damage that might occur from any one&#13;
incident. The bonus represents 87% of premiums charged to the Power Plant Fund and is an indication&#13;
of the ongoing good safety record that EGAT has achieved as well as the fact that the size of the fund&#13;
is close to its maximum. Good Claims Bonuses are not paid by any of the other funds. The maximum&#13;
size of the fund has been set at $116 million indexed for inflation after September 30, 1990 and is based&#13;
on one potential claim of $50 million and two claims of $33 million.&#13;
3.23         The annual premiums charged against revenue by the various funds are calculated in a&#13;
variety of ways and are in general, below market rates. Premiums paid to the Power Plant Fund,&#13;
Aeroplane Fund, and the Personal Accident Fund are calculated according to the method suggested by&#13;
the Royal Insurance Service Company Ltd. in its 1983 report. Premiums for the Heavy Equipment Fund&#13;
are calculated and charged on assets until they reach half of their useful life, while premiums of the&#13;
Vehicle Fund are charged on new assets for only one year. EGAT has also insured certain buildings&#13;
through a Building Fund which was set up in 1993. Cover is provided against fire and the premium&#13;
charged approximates to a commercial rate. Only buildings which have an indexed depreciated cost of&#13;
Baht 10 million and over are covered by this new fund. The insurance arrangements are satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank and EGAT would continue to make these provisions.&#13;
Taxes&#13;
3.24         In accordance with regulations applicable to state enterprises, EGAT is liable to remit to&#13;
the Ministry of Finance a proportion of its net income. As advised by the Government's Budget Bureau,&#13;
EGAT has been remitting taxes each year since September 30, 1982 at a level which rose from 5% of&#13;
net income to the current level of 30%. This is despite the fact that the budget document itself laid down&#13;
a rate of 25%. In May 1993, EGAT applied for "Good State Enterprise" status and to qualify, EGAT&#13;
needs to comply with a number of criteria, including being able to maintain a net income at a level that&#13;
will permit remittance to the Ministry of Finance of 30%. EGAT is expected to become a good state&#13;
enterprise in FY95.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
3.25         EGAT pays custom duties and business taxes on imported equipment and materials for&#13;
its projects included in the Sixth Development Plan from its own resources. Until the Fifth Development&#13;
Plan (1982-1986), custom duties were covered by the Government in the form of equity contributions.&#13;

Chapter IV&#13;
The Project&#13;
A. Project Objectives and Description&#13;
4.1        The main objectives of the proposed project are: (a) to assist EGAT in optimizing its&#13;
investment decisions and help meet the system's peak power demand from 2000 onwards at least cost;&#13;
(b) to strengthen the environmental capabilities of EGAT; and (c) to assist the Government in&#13;
rationalizing the bulk supply tariff to PEA and MEA as a prelude to the corporatization and&#13;
privatization of the generation, transmission and distribution utilities. In addition, the Bank expects,&#13;
during the project's tenure, to continue rendering technical advice to the Government in the&#13;
implementation of power sub-sector and environmental reforms.&#13;
4.2        The proposed project is the first stage (2x250 MW) of the 1,000 MW Lam Takhong Pump&#13;
Storage Scheme. The scheme involves: (a) pumping during off-peak hours of about 9 million cubic&#13;
meters (MCM) of water from the existing Lam Takhong reservoir to a new upper level reservoir; and&#13;
(b) releasing water into the Lam Takhong reservoir generating about 1,000 MW of power during the&#13;
system peak period. The project involves: (a) an upstream reservoir of 10 MCM capacity; (b) water&#13;
conduit systems comprising tunnels and penstocks for the full development; (c) an underground power&#13;
house for all the four units; (d) 2x250 MW reversible pump-turbine units; (e) an outdoor switchyard; (f)&#13;
2x230 kV double-circuit transmission lines of about 15km route length; (g) consulting services for&#13;
design and construction supervision; (h) environmental impact mitigation and rehabilitation of affected&#13;
persons; (i) computer hardware, software and training for strengthening the environmental capabilities&#13;
of EGAT; and (j) a consulting study for rationalization of the bulk supply tariff.&#13;
Lam Takhong Pump Storage Scheme&#13;
4.3        The Lam Takhong Pump Storage project is located at Khao Khuen Lun, Pak Chong&#13;
District, Nakhon Ratchasima Province, about 200 km north-east of Bangkok. The development consists&#13;
of the existing Lam Takhong Reservoir situated on the Lam Takhong River, a tributary of the Mun&#13;
River which in turn is a tributary of the Mekong River. The Lam Takhong reservoir would be&#13;
connected to a new upper reservoir situated on a plateau some 350 m above, by a system of shafts and&#13;
tunnels through an underground powerhouse. The powerhouse would contain reversible machines&#13;
which, during off peak periods, would utilize excess generating capacity in the system to pump about 9&#13;
MCM of water from the lower to the upper reservoir. During peak periods, the operation would be&#13;
reversed and stored water would be run down for power generation. The total plant capacity of 1,000&#13;
MW (989 Gwh per annum) would be developed in two stages. The first stage comprising 2x250 MW&#13;
units and covering most of the civil works is scheduled for commissioning in 2000. The second stage&#13;
comprising an additional 2x250 MW units would be commissioned in 2003.&#13;
4.4        The main features of the project are:&#13;
(a)  an upper reservoir consisting of a rectangular pond with a surface area of 0.3 km2 and a&#13;
volume of 9.9 MCM bounded by a rockfill dam and lined with an asphaltic membrane;&#13;
the dam has a maximum height of 50 m and a volume of 5.4 MCM;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
(b)  two morning-glory intakes leading to steel lined inclined shafts 6.0 m diameter, 690 m in&#13;
length;&#13;
(c)   an underground power house containing four reversible Francis type generating/pumping&#13;
units, each with an output (while generating) of 250 MW at a rated net head of 360 m.;&#13;
(d)  two concrete-lined tailrace tunnels 6.8 m dia., 1,470 m in length.&#13;
4.5        Optimization. The optimization of the power plant configuration and capacity was carried&#13;
out by consultants in two phases. The first phase determined the upper reservoir location and waterway&#13;
route.  Of two possible locations for the upper reservoir, the one which avoided relocation of&#13;
inhabitants and Class IA forest land, and which also proved to be the most economical, was chosen.&#13;
For this location, the least cost alternative, among three alternative waterways, was selected. The&#13;
second phase determined the optimum ultimate size of the plant, in terms of generating capacity and&#13;
daily operating hours as limited by reservoir storage. Five alternative capacities between 500 MW to&#13;
1,200 MW and reservoir capacities between 4 to 14 hour generation (in two hour increments) were&#13;
considered. A development with 1,000 MW and a reservoir capacity equal to 8 hour generation gave&#13;
the maximum benefit/cost ratio. System studies indicated that pumping rate should be limited to 500&#13;
MW, at least in the early stages, to maintain system stability; hence an installation with 4x250 MW&#13;
units was decided upon as the optimum solution. The reservoir filling time with two units running is&#13;
about 20 hours.&#13;
4.6         Site Investigations. The geological assessment of the site is based on comprehensive site&#13;
investigations and laboratory tests, which over the course of the feasibility and final design stages have&#13;
included the following activities: (a) seismic refraction over the reservoir site over four lines totalling&#13;
3,600 m; test pitting, soil sampling and laboratory testing of soils; (b) diamond drilling totalling 3,172&#13;
m in 28 holes; testing in drill-holes including 310 permeability tests, 96 deformation tests, 33 hydraulic&#13;
fracturing tests and P-S wave logging at 294 m; and (c) an exploratory adit to the powerhouse and&#13;
along its axis with a total length of 1,533 m; testing in the adit including convergence measurement,&#13;
plate bearing test and P-S prospecting along its walls.&#13;
4.7        Geology. The geology of the plateau on which the upper reservoir is founded, and in&#13;
which the underground works are located, consists of alternations of flat bedded coarse and fine grained&#13;
sandstones and siltstones with thin layers of claystone. The penstock from the reservoir floor passes&#13;
through a 60 m thickness of coarse grained sandstone, 150 m of alternations of fine grained sandstone&#13;
and siltstone, and 215 m of siltstone ending in fine grained sandstone. The sandstones are hard,&#13;
generally massive, relatively strong (60 MPa) and have a relatively low deformation modulus. While&#13;
they are generally of low permeability, there are occasional high permeability areas, coinciding with&#13;
strongly jointed zones, particularly in the coarse grained rock. The siltstone is massive, softer, weaker&#13;
(10 to 30 Mpa), and highly deformable. On the other hand, jointing is generally infrequent and&#13;
permeability low. Weathering over the site is highly developed for a depth of 20 m although slight&#13;
weathering persists to depths of over 70 m. No major faulting has been detected, although shear zones&#13;
running parallel to the bedding planes are evident in the drill cores.&#13;
4.8        Design Aspects. The engineering implications of the above and the design measures&#13;
necessary to deal with them, as agreed among EGAT design engineers, the consultants and the&#13;
International Board of Experts (para. 4.16), are summarized below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
(a)   Upper reservoir. The rock is suitable as a foundation for the proposed embankment dam.&#13;
Permeability is such that an asphaltic membrane liner and drainage beneath the liner will&#13;
be provided. Excavated rock and soil are suitable for incorporation in the dam.&#13;
(b)   Tunnels. Tunneling conditions are expected to be generally good; however occasional&#13;
high water inflows are expected and would be allowed for. Silltstone would be protected&#13;
immediately after excavation to prevent slaking. Shotcrete and occasional bolting would&#13;
suffice as temporary support. The inclined shaft will be continuous and driven full face&#13;
from the top which is slower but less risky in terms of safety and construction progress. In&#13;
view of the softness of the silltstone and its tendency to weather, the pressure tunnel will&#13;
be steel lined but the design will take rock sharing into account.&#13;
(c)   Underground powerhouse. The major concern is the high deformability of the rock which&#13;
in conjunction with the high insitu stresses due to overburden depth could result in long&#13;
term convergence of the walls of the cavern. Measures adopted to deal with this problem&#13;
were: (a) orientation of the longitudinal axis of the cavern parallel to the direction of&#13;
maximum horizontal stress; (b) lowering of the cavern about 35 m so that it is situated&#13;
largely in fine grained sandstone, the most competent of the strata encountered; and (c)&#13;
detailed specification of cavern excavation and support measures to control deformations.&#13;
International Waterway&#13;
4.9        The Lam Takhong reservoir (which serves the municipal and irrigation water needs of the&#13;
downstream communities in the province of Nakhon Ratchasima) is an existing reservoir in the&#13;
headwaters of the Lam Takhong River. The Lam Takhong River is an upstream tributary of the Mun&#13;
River, which in turn is a tributary of the Mekong River, an international waterway. While the Mun&#13;
River contributes about 17% of the flow of the Mekong River, the Lam Takhong River contributes only&#13;
about 1 % of the flow of the Mun River. The project involves pumping out during off-peak hours of&#13;
only about 3 % of the reservoir volume, but the same quantum of water is restored to the reservoir dur-&#13;
ing the peak period. The small amount (40,000 cum/annum) of water that would be utilized for drip&#13;
irrigation from the uphill reservoir would be more than compensated by the decrease in evaporation&#13;
(estimated at 700,000 cum/annum) due to reduced surface area exposure of the lower reservoir. There&#13;
would thus be no net deprivation of water from the Lam Takhong reservoir nor any effect on the water&#13;
quality due to the project. The outflow of water from the Lam Takhong reservoir would continue to be&#13;
governed by the downstream water needs and not by the system's generation requirements. The impact&#13;
on the flow of the Lam Takhong River would thus be insignificant and the impact on the flow of the&#13;
Mun and Mekong rivers would be imperceptible.&#13;
4.10       The downstream riparian states are Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam. Together with&#13;
Thailand, these countries are members of the Mekong Committee, established in 1957 by them as an&#13;
autonomous inter-governmental agency to promote, coordinate, supervise and control the planning,&#13;
investigation and implementation of water resources development projects on the lower Mekong basin&#13;
(including international projects on the Mekong River as well as national projects on tributaries). The&#13;
Mekong Committee was suspended in 1991 and has apparently not functioned since that date.&#13;
However, recently, representatives of Thailand, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Lao PDR have pledged to&#13;
establish a new framework of cooperation for the sustainable development of the Mekong River Basin.&#13;
As far as the Bank has been able to ascertain, that framework has not yet been formally established.&#13;
The three downstream riparian states (Lao PDR, Cambodia and Viet Nam) were notified on December&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
15, 1994 of the project by the Bank, through their Executive Directors and were given until February&#13;
28, 1995 to respond. No communication was received from Lao PDR and Cambodia by the stipulated&#13;
time. Viet Nam asked for more information for studying the project and wanted to be assured that&#13;
Thailand would notify this project to the newly constituted Mekong Committee at its first meeting in&#13;
April 1995. Full details of the project were provided by the Bank to the Vietnamese on March 14,&#13;
1995 together with written assurances from EGAT that Thailand would indeed notify the project to the&#13;
Mekong Committee. No further communication was received from Viet Nam by the subsequently&#13;
established stipulated date of April 3, 1995.  As none of the downstream riparians have raised&#13;
objections to the project and in view of the Bank's staff assessment that the project will neither cause&#13;
harm to the interests of the other riparians, nor be harmed by other riparians' possible water use, it was&#13;
decided to proceed with the processing of the project.&#13;
Strengthening the Environmental Capabilities of EGAT&#13;
4.11       In 1993, EGAT uplifted its Ecology and Environment Division to departmental level as&#13;
Environmental Department (ED) under the Deputy General Manager, Engineering. It sought and&#13;
received substantial technical assistance from the Australian International Development Assistance&#13;
Bureau (AIDAB) in strengthening the management, planning and implementation capabilities of the ED.&#13;
A long-term AIDAB Environmental Planning Adviser has been working with the ED since February&#13;
1994. A Project for Strengthening the Environmental Capabilities of EGAT (a 4-year program with a&#13;
budget estimate of A$5.5 million) has been formulated for possible financing by AIDAB. The key&#13;
components of this Project are:&#13;
(a)   Environmental Management System. Technical assistance to continue to strengthen and&#13;
develop EGAT's environmental management systems to the standard of "best practice&#13;
environmental management".&#13;
(b)   Specialist Environmental, Operational Management and Technical Advice and Assistance.&#13;
High quality, tailored, specialist advice and implementation assistance in each of the&#13;
environmental, operational management and technical areas identified, to strengthen&#13;
EGAT's environmental performance and environmental infrastructure.&#13;
(c)   Environmental Training and Education. Specialist environmental training and education&#13;
essential to the sustainable strengthening of EGAT's environmental skills, capabilities and&#13;
performance.&#13;
(d)   Environmental Equipment Facilities.  Specification, acquisition and use of additional&#13;
environmental sampling, monitoring and analysis equipment needed to ensure that there&#13;
are no infrastructural impediments to sustainably strengthening EGAT's environmental&#13;
performance.&#13;
4.12       Under the proposed project, EGAT would undertake the development of an Integrated&#13;
Environmental Information Management System (EIMS) package, the objective of which would be to&#13;
accept, manage, analyze and structure different sources and types of information required for&#13;
environmental studies and analyses, for engineering site construction referencing, for identifying&#13;
corporate positions and for generating other relevant data. The EIMS would have the following&#13;
components:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
(a)   Database.   This will comprise inter-connected graphics and attribute databases. The&#13;
latter will be a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for the storage,&#13;
management and maintenance of attribute information. The graphics database will be an&#13;
interactive, flexible, user-friendly, Computer-Aided-Drafting/Design (CADD) engine for&#13;
the storage and maintenance of maps, drawings, airphotos, documentation images, etc.&#13;
(b)   Interface.    The interface would provide user screens to accept different types of&#13;
information and provide efficient search techniques to extract required information,&#13;
graphics, etc.&#13;
(c)   Inputs and Outputs. Inputs would be handled by a variety of application modules, directly&#13;
interfacing with the environment database.  Inputs would include scanned, digitized,&#13;
survey, photogrammetric, remote sensing, digital data, textual information, etc.  The&#13;
EIMS will support several devices for data output, including those for producing high&#13;
quality maps, reports, technical publications, image management systems and video&#13;
outputs.&#13;
(d)   Application. The EIMS system would provide access to the same database for different&#13;
purposes, through online viewing. Access to specialized applications would be provided&#13;
by the system with the automatic linkages to the attribute and graphics databases.&#13;
Examples of application would be: CADD, spatial analysis, planning, image analysis,&#13;
terrain modelling, engineering database, business applications, scanning and imaging, etc.&#13;
4.13       A  feasibility study with consulting assistance would be undertaken to define the&#13;
requirements, the scope, the recommended hardware and software packages (GIS, CADD, RDBMS,&#13;
etc.), the interface strategy and an effective implementation plan. The feasibility study would include&#13;
detailed description of system components, data flow diagrams, application models, communications&#13;
requirements, database diagrams, capacities and features within each major component, as well as&#13;
equipment specifications. Provision would be made for technical transfer and training of EGAT&#13;
personnel on the installation, maintenance and application of the EIMS system.&#13;
Rationalization of Bulk Supply Tariff to MEA and PEA&#13;
4.14       MEA and PEA receive power from EGAT in bulk at several of their grid substations.&#13;
The bulk supply tariff to MEA and PEA as currently applied comprises a flat energy charge. Without&#13;
a demand charge or a variation depending on time of use, the tariff does not reflect the costs of supply,&#13;
and is, therefore, inadequate to give correct signals to the distribution utilities to improve their load&#13;
factor, load shape and power factor or foster energy conservation. The bulk supply tariffs to MEA and&#13;
PEA are set by the Government, taking into account the financial needs of the three utilities. The&#13;
current tariff for bulk supply to MEA is 1.47 Baht/kwh, whereas the tariff to PEA is 0.96 Baht/kwh,&#13;
although the actual cost of supply to PEA is greater than the cost of supply to MEA. The difference in&#13;
the tariff to the two utilities, MEA and PEA, is intentional, so that the urban consumers subsidize the&#13;
rural consumers, the retail tariff for all consumers in Thailand being uniform. The current bulk supply&#13;
arrangements between EGAT and MEA/PEA would no longer be appropriate when the electricity sector&#13;
is restructured; EGAT, MEA and PEA are corporatized; and IPPs begin to function on the grid. New&#13;
bulk supply arrangements would need to be evolved. If a subsidy needs to be provided for electrifying&#13;
rural consumers, it may have to be provided through a separate transparent mechanism. Likewise, the&#13;
Government would also need to consider abolishing uniform retail tariffs throughout the country. At&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached that EGAT would undertake a study for the rationalization of the&#13;
bulk supply tariff, according to terms of reference agreed with the Bank, and promptly thereafter, the&#13;
Government will review with the Bank the recommendations of that study and implement the said&#13;
recommendations taking into account the Bank's views. Terms of reference for the study are at Annex&#13;
10.&#13;
B. Implementation&#13;
4.15       Design and Supervision Arrangements. The project design would be undertaken jointly by&#13;
EGAT and the consultants, EPDC of Japan. EGAT would carry out the civil designs, including&#13;
drawings and technical specifications under the supervision of the consultants. The consultants would&#13;
develop the technical specifications for the mechanical and electrical equipment. The terms of reference&#13;
for the consulting services are acceptable to the Bank.  The construction organization would be&#13;
modelled on the lines of the Pak Mun Hydropower project which was recently completed on schedule.&#13;
A Project Implementation Plan, following the Bank guidelines, has been prepared by EGAT (Annex&#13;
24). The organizational arrangements for design and construction of the Lam Takhong Pump Storage&#13;
project and implementing its environmental and rehabilitation plans are shown in Charts 2, 3 and 4,&#13;
respectively. A project team has been set up and a project manager appointed by EGAT for project&#13;
construction. The functions of the "Engineer" as defined by the FIDIC conditions of contract would be&#13;
assigned to EPDC, although in keeping with its normal practice, EGAT would maintain strong financial&#13;
control.&#13;
4.16       Review Arrangements. An International Board of Experts (IBE), has been appointed to&#13;
review dam safety aspects of the design and construction of the upper reservoir, and to advise on design&#13;
and construction aspects of all other elements of the project. The IBE consists of internationally&#13;
recognized experts, with wide experience in engineering geology, rock mechanics and underground&#13;
opening design; and design and construction of dams and hydroelectric structures. Interaction between&#13;
EGAT engineers, the consultants and the IBE has been particularly synergetic, resulting in innovative,&#13;
affordable design responses to the particular challenges of the project. The bid documents for the&#13;
Electromechanical Equipment would be furnished to the Bank.  The implementation of the&#13;
environmental and rehabilitation plans would be periodically reviewed by the independent&#13;
Environmental Panel member appointed by the Bank.&#13;
4.17       Implementation Schedule: A summary implementation schedule is shown in Chart 5.&#13;
The critical path for implementation of the project passes through the construction of the main access&#13;
tunnel to the powerhouse, powerhouse cavern excavation and generating equipment erection. With this&#13;
in mind, EGAT has called for bids on a limited invitation basis for access tunnel construction to be&#13;
financed by EGAT.  Nine well qualified contractors, two local and seven international presently&#13;
working in Thailand, have been invited to bid.  Construction of this access tunnel would allow&#13;
construction time from award of main civil contract to award of first generating unit to be reduced to 52&#13;
months. Bids for main civil and generating equipment contracts are scheduled to be invited in March&#13;
1995, contracts awarded in October 1995, with unit commissionings in February and May, 2000.&#13;
4.18       Operations. EGAT has defined organization and procedures for dealing with dam safety&#13;
dating since 1982, when it issued Dam Safety Regulation for controlling the safety of its dams. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
Civil Maintenance Department has been given the responsibility for dam safety and this organization has&#13;
developed procedures based on the SEED manual published by the Water and Power Resources Service,&#13;
U.S. Department of Interior. They provide for inspections by an 11 member Dam Inspection Team, in&#13;
accordance with a schedule determined by dam height, and following a defined checklist. They also&#13;
specify routine dam safety measures to be implemented by dam operators and regional superintendents.&#13;
These procedures have been satisfactorily implemented for EGAT's 13 existing large dams.  At&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached that EGAT would, under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
cause the upper reservoir dam to be periodically inspected in accordance with sound engineering&#13;
practice in order to determine whether there are any deficiencies in the condition of this structure, or in&#13;
the quality and adequacy of maintenance or methods of operations of the same, which may endanger its&#13;
safety.&#13;
Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
4.19       Satisfactory procedures for monitoring the progress of the project in terms of physical&#13;
execution and financial reports have been agreed with EGAT which would furnish quarterly progress&#13;
reports. An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) would be drafted by the Bank not later than six&#13;
months after completion of the loan and EGAT would assist in its preparation. EGAT would adopt the&#13;
plan for the operational phase of the project and together with the Bank, define the performance&#13;
indicators to be used to monitor operations and development impact. EGAT would also prepare and&#13;
make available to the Bank its own evaluation report, including a summary report which would be&#13;
attached unedited to the ICR. The evaluation would assess the project execution and initial operation,&#13;
its costs and benefits, the Bank's performance, its own performance of the obligations under the Loan&#13;
Agreement, and the extent to which the purposes of the loan were achieved.&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
4.20       Supervision of this project would be undertaken along with the Bank's ongoing power&#13;
projects in Thailand. The key issues that would be focused upon are: (a) periodic reviews of EGAT's&#13;
power development plan in keeping with changes in the economic scenario; (b) monitoring of&#13;
compliance with financial covenants to assure the financial health of EGAT while undertaking a large&#13;
investment program; (c) close monitoring of the implementation of the environmental impact mitigation&#13;
and rehabilitation plans for the project; and (d) adequate technical supervision for the dam and&#13;
associated civil works. The Bank missions would also assist EGAT and the Government in their efforts&#13;
towards privatization and energy conservation and provide advice on environmental issues. Supervision&#13;
of the project would require expertise in hydropower engineering, economics, financial analysis,&#13;
environmental engineering and rehabilitation and compensation. Two missions annually for a period of&#13;
four years are foreseen for adequate supervision of this project. The total estimated staff inputs are: (a)&#13;
power engineer, economist and financial analyst -- 8 staff-weeks (on the basis of sharing with other&#13;
EGAT projects); (b) hydropower engineer -- 8 staff-weeks; (c) environmental specialist -- 6 staff-&#13;
weeks; and (d) rehabilitation expert -- 6 staff-weeks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. Cost Estimates&#13;
4.21         The total cost of the project (including capitalized interest during construction) is estimated&#13;
at US$585.6 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$308.4 million. For civil works, direct&#13;
cost unit rates were developed from basic resource costs for all major items, with separate estimates for&#13;
general site installations and general site services. Metalworks costs were derived from prevailing&#13;
international market rates in recent bids. Electro-mechanical costs were derived taking into account&#13;
experience curves and manufacturers' budget prices. Physical contingencies are assumed at 10% of the&#13;
base cost for preliminary works, civil works and environmental and rehabilitation plans and 5%  of the&#13;
base cost for plant and equipment. Price contingencies are estimated on the basis of escalation factors&#13;
of 5 % per annum for local cost components and 2.5 % per annum for foreign cost components,&#13;
following the Bank's latest forecast. Table 4.1 summarizes the cost estimates for the project which are&#13;
given in greater detail in Annex 11.&#13;

D. Financing Plan&#13;
4.22       The financing plan for the project is shown in Table 4.2. The proposed Bank loan of&#13;
US$100 million equivalent would meet about 33% of the foreign cost of the project (excluding IDC) or&#13;
17% of project financing requirements. The proposed Bank loan would be made to EGAT at the&#13;
Bank's standard variable interest rate for a 17 year term including five years of grace on repayment of&#13;
principal. Cofinancing from OECF of Japan, in the amount of about US$184 million, would cover&#13;
electromechanical equipment, hydraulic equipment and consulting services. Supplier's credits and&#13;
foreign commercial bank loans would be used to finance the foreign costs (aggregating US$24.4&#13;
million) of ancillary equipment. Local costs amounting to US$277.2 million equivalent would be&#13;
financed from EGAT's internal cash generation supplemented by local borrowing. EGAT would bear&#13;
the foreign exchange and interest rate risks; the loan would be guaranteed by the Kingdom of Thailand.&#13;

E. Procurement&#13;
4.23       Almost 99% of the Bank loan would be used for financing the major civil works for the&#13;
project. Bids would be invited using international competitive bidding procedures (ICB) according to&#13;
the Bank guidelines, through a single contract package worth about US$203 million equivalent. Bidders&#13;
have already been prequalified to bid for this package, using prequalification documents and procedures&#13;
approved by the Bank. EGAT would follow the Bank's standard procurement documents in preparing&#13;
the bid documents. The contract would allow for price variation for parameters agreed with the Bank.&#13;
Environmental equipment, essentially comprising specialized software and hardware, worth about&#13;
US$0.75 million equivalent would be procured through Limited International Bidding or International&#13;
Shopping procedures following the Bank guidelines.  Consulting services for the Tariff study,&#13;
amounting to about US$0.25 million equivalent, would be procured following the Bank guidelines for&#13;
selection and employment of consultants. Bid documents and contract awards with respect to each&#13;
Bank-financed contract, estimated to cost the equivalent of US$2.0 million or more, would be subject to&#13;
prior review and approval by the Bank.&#13;
4.24       The main electromechanical equipment would be procured through international&#13;
competitive bidding procedures specified by the OECF of Japan. Contracts for ancillary equipment&#13;
would be obtained through EGAT's own international competitive bidding procedures which are similar&#13;
to those of the Bank. Contracts for preparatory civil works would be let out by EGAT through local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
competitive bidding procedures that are acceptable to the Bank. Consultants for project design and&#13;
supervision have been appointed by EGAT and the consultancy arrangements are satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
4.25          Annex 12 presents the Key Date Schedule for procurement, while Annex 13 gives details&#13;
of the eight procurement packages (excluding environmental equipment) for the project.&#13;
4.26          Table 4.3 summarizes the procurement arrangements for the components expected to be&#13;

F. Disbursements&#13;
4.27       The Bank loan would be disbursed against: (a) 50% of expenditures for civil works; (b)&#13;
100% of foreign expenditures and 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 50% of local&#13;
expenditures for other items procured locally, for goods and equipment; and (c) 100% for consulting&#13;
services. As there would be only about three contracts, Statement of Expenditures (SOE) procedures&#13;
would not be followed nor would a Special Account be opened. However, EGAT will ensure that each&#13;
withdrawal application will not be less than US$100,000 equivalent.&#13;
4.28       Annex 14 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan and the standard&#13;
profile of disbursements for power projects in Asia. Based on experience with the last two Bank loans&#13;
to EGAT (Loans 3138-TH and 3243-TH), the advanced stage of preparation by EGAT for the project,&#13;
and considering that there is only one major contract financed by the Bank, the proposed loan is&#13;
expected to be disbursed faster than indicated by the standard profile. The project is expected to be&#13;
completed by June 30, 2000 and the closing date for the loan would be December 31, 2000.&#13;
4.29       Retroactive financing equivalent to about 3% of the proposed loan would be permitted to&#13;
the extent of US$250,000 equivalent for payments made for expenditures on consulting services for the&#13;
Tariff Study, prior to the date of the Project Agreement but after August 4, 1994. This is necessary as&#13;
the Government would like this study to be carried out as early as possible as it would like to introduce&#13;
tariff reforms this year and in order to meet its privatization program for the power sub-sector.&#13;

CHAPTER V&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
A. Environmental Impact Evaluation and Approval&#13;
5.1        The project falls under Category A and its environmental impacts have been adequately&#13;
identified through a detailed EIA undertaken by the Khon Kaen University.  The EIA and the&#13;
supplementary documentation developed by EGAT has undergone the newly constituted review process&#13;
involving the Office of Environmental Policy and Planning (OEPP) (including review by an&#13;
Environmental Expert Committee having NGO representation) and the National Environmental Board,&#13;
and the project and the EIA have been approved by the National Economic and Social Development&#13;
Board and by the Cabinet. The people in the district have been informed about the project through&#13;
seminars and the affected villagers have been fully involved in designing the rehabilitation program.&#13;
The OEPP has finalized and published a detailed "Implementation Plan - Environmental Mitigation and&#13;
Development", January 1994 (EMDP), which inter-alia calls for the appointment of a coordinating and&#13;
supervisory committee, named the Committee for the Coordination of Assistance to the Affected People&#13;
and Environmental Development, comprising representatives from all concerned departments and&#13;
agencies, from local and provincial administrations, and from affected people; and assigns the role of&#13;
monitoring and evaluation to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment. There has been&#13;
close interaction between EGAT, the Bank missions and the Environmental Expert appointed by the&#13;
Bank, and the Bank requirements supplementing the EMDP have been agreed with and documented by&#13;
EGAT in the "August 1994, Addendum to the Implementation Plan, Environmental Mitigation and&#13;
Development".  The EMDP, adopted by the Government on February 15, 1994, sets forth the&#13;
requirements for managing the environmental protection of all land and river areas affected by the&#13;
project, and for rehabilitating affected persons. The August 1994 Addendum to the aforementioned&#13;
document amplifies the modalities and procedures for rehabilitating and compensating all persons whose&#13;
livelihood is to be affected by the project, and details the necessary actions for implementing and&#13;
performance indicators for monitoring. The two documents together form the plan for implementing&#13;
the environmental mitigation and development and rehabilitation required under the project. Annex 24&#13;
lists the environmental documentation on the project.  The environmental impact mitigation and&#13;
rehabilitation plans are satisfactory to the Bank. At negotiations, it was agreed that EGAT would carry&#13;
out the Environmental Impact Mitigation and Rehabilitation Plans as set forth in the documents: (a)&#13;
Implementation Plan - Environmental Mitigation and Development, January 1994, by OEPP; and (b)&#13;
August 1994, Addendum to the Implementation Plan, Environmental Mitigation and Development, by&#13;
EGAT, including provision of necessary budget, appointment of committees for managing and&#13;
supervising implementation and agencies for monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
B. Enviromnental Impact and Impact Mitigation&#13;
Base Line Data&#13;
5.2        Baseline data, developed by Khon Kaen University (KKU) during an 18-month (August&#13;
1990 to February 1992) environmental assessment study and by several subsequent investigations by&#13;
EGAT and KKU, are briefly summarized below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
(a)   The Lam Takhong Reservoir has been in operation since 1968. Reservoir fisheries yield&#13;
approximately 95 tons/year of fish valued at Baht 2.5 million for an estimated 100 part-&#13;
time fishermen and 3 full-time fishermen.  These yields occur with only occasional&#13;
stocking and with no other enhancement measures other than Government regulations on&#13;
fishing methods and seasons.&#13;
(b)   The 22 ha that would be required for spoil disposal extend from the existing highway into&#13;
the shallow edge of the Lam Takhong reservoir. This area would be an extension of the&#13;
existing highway grade, is not inhabited and includes no notable vegetation.&#13;
(c)   The 218 ha upper reservoir area is located on land that is included in watershed Class lB.&#13;
Some of the underground structures will be located well beneath, and would not impinge&#13;
on, land that is classified as watershed Class IA.&#13;
(d)   Land use of the upper reservoir area would include 59 ha of forest plantation area and 159&#13;
ha of agricultural land.  The agricultural land comprises grassland and fallow land,&#13;
cultivated land, degraded forest land and others. There is no irrigation. Crops cultivated&#13;
in the area include mango, cashew, jackfruit, cassava and others.&#13;
Potential Environmental Impacts&#13;
5.3         Potential adverse impacts of the project have been under systematic investigation and&#13;
review  by KKU, EGAT  and concerned environmental authorities since August 1990.   Field&#13;
investigations included searches of all areas affected by the project for rare and endangered species, rare&#13;
or unique ecological communities and archaeological materials, but none of these items were found.&#13;
The project does not pose any impacts of a nature that cannot be eliminated, minimized to acceptable&#13;
levels or mitigated through project design, location and operation and it is unlikely to result in&#13;
significant residual impacts. Notable project impacts are given below:&#13;
(a)   Land. The main impact of the project would be caused by the construction of the upper&#13;
reservoir and would include: (i) displacement of 59 ha of established forest plantations; (ii)&#13;
loss of access to 218 ha area during the construction stage; (iii) permanent loss of access&#13;
to 65 ha which will become the upper reservoir and ancillary areas; (iv) changes in soil&#13;
characteristics due to excavation, spoil disposal and regrading; and (v) associated losses of&#13;
agricultural produce and income.&#13;
(b)   Fisheries. The main impact on fisheries is expected to be increased mortality of fish&#13;
through entrainment and exposure to high pressure in the penstocks during pumping.&#13;
Phytoplankton and zooplankton mortality due to entrainment is not likely to be significant.&#13;
(c)   Downstream Water Users. There is concern among downstream users that construction&#13;
and operation of the project would result in losses of water, or constraints on reservoir&#13;
operation, that will affect the availability of water to downstream users. However, this&#13;
concern is not justified as: (i) the pump storage project will recycle water, not consume it;&#13;
and (ii) rules for reservoir operation will give priority to downstream users.&#13;
(d)   Sedimentation. Resuspension of sediment as a result of pumping and power generation is&#13;
not likely to cause significant ecological impacts on the Lam Takhong reservoir or to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
increase the amount of sediment that is entrained by the intakes for the downstream water&#13;
supply. Hydrographic studies conclude that about 370 years would be required for the&#13;
volume of sediment deposition to equal the volume of dead storage. By that time the live&#13;
storage capacity of the reservoir would have been reduced by about 34%.&#13;
(e)   Construction. Other impacts would be typical of any large construction projects such as&#13;
impacts of the construction labor force, truck traffic, erosion, air and water pollution,&#13;
noise and public health.&#13;
Environmental Impact Mitigation Plans&#13;
General&#13;
5.4        The mitigation measures for environmental impacts are embodied in the EMDP and&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)   Plan for environmental mitigation and development during construction:&#13;
(i)   Prevention of soil erosion&#13;
(ii)  Control and prevention of sediment dispersion in the reservoir&#13;
(iii)  Prevention of air pollution, noise and vibration&#13;
(iv)  Mitigation and development of traffic system&#13;
(v)   Preparation for hygiene at the construction site&#13;
(b)   Plan for environmental mitigation and development after construction:&#13;
(i)   Environmental rehabilitation and development in the project site including&#13;
reforestation of 1,230 ha of the most degraded forest in the Khao Tien-Khao&#13;
Khuanlon Reserved Forest Area&#13;
(ii)  Fishery resource conservation in the Lam Takhong reservoir&#13;
(iii)  Water resource management&#13;
5.5        The plan for controlling and offsetting fish mortality from entrainment includes: (a) a net&#13;
around the intake structure with 0.5 cm mesh size; (b) fish breeding and releasing including a fish&#13;
hatchery, nursery ponds, floating nets and fish cages; (c) fishery resources conservation including the&#13;
protection of spawning areas and reduction of illegal fishing; and (d) continued monitoring of reservoir&#13;
limnology and fisheries.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
5.6        The EMDP includes a monitoring plan which comprises the following:&#13;
(a)   Plan for monitoring and evaluating the forest rehabilitation&#13;
(b)   Plan for monitoring and evaluating of the aquatic biology and fishery in the Lam Takhong&#13;
reservoir&#13;
(c)   Plan for monitoring and evaluating of the water resources management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
5.7        The plan for monitoring and evaluation of water resources management is intended to&#13;
alleviate the concerns of downstream users by having OEPP and the Royal Irrigation Department: (a)&#13;
collect and compile necessary data for the continuous management of Lam Takhong water resources;&#13;
and (b) conduct regular compilation and analysis of data for the future adaptation of water resource.&#13;
The project cost estimate includes funding for this monitoring and evaluation for the first six years after&#13;
the start of project operations.&#13;
Budget&#13;
5.8        A  total budget provision of Baht 87.7 million has been made for mitigation of&#13;
environmental impacts (see Annex 15 for details).&#13;
C. Rehabilitation&#13;
Scope of Rehabilitation&#13;
5.9        The construction of the upper reservoir requires acquisition of 26 ha of land, in 74&#13;
parcels, belonging to 72 owners. 43 of the owners reside at the Khoa Yai Tiang village while 29&#13;
owners reside in villages of different sub-districts or districts of Nakhon Ratchasima or different&#13;
provinces. Houses of none of these owners will be affected by the project and hence no resettlement of&#13;
persons will be involved. In addition to those whose lands would be affected, some 100 families fishing&#13;
in the lower reservoir may be affected. A study to determine the precise impact on the income levels of&#13;
the fishing families is currently underway.&#13;
Socio-Economic Survey&#13;
5.10       The socio-economic features of the community affected by the project have been studied&#13;
by the Khon Khaen University. Most of the affected families partially rely on agriculture for income.&#13;
Agriculture is of the rainfed type and therefore the affected people supplement income from agriculture&#13;
by pursuing non-farm activities such as animal rearing, wage labor etc. Almost 42% of their annual&#13;
income is derived from earnings of those family members who temporarily work outside the area. The&#13;
annual average income per family is estimated at Baht 40,910 and the median income at Baht 38,640.&#13;
The average annual agricultural income from land required for the project is estimated at Baht 16,500.&#13;
Rehabilitation Strategy&#13;
5.11       The basic principle governing economic rehabilitation of the affected people would be that&#13;
"living conditions and quality of life of the affected people should improve". Compensation for the&#13;
affected land and properties would be paid at a rate which is equivalent to the replacement value of the&#13;
assets lost. In order to achieve the rehabilitation objective, a mix of land based and non-land based&#13;
economic rehabilitation is proposed. Apart from arrangements for long term rehabilitation, short term&#13;
measures to supplement income during the transition phase are also proposed. The affected persons&#13;
would be: (a) provided replacement value of compensation for the assets lost; (b) allocated 0.8 ha of&#13;
land per household for horticulture; (c) provided with cash support for the first four years after land&#13;
acquisition; (d) given loans for initiation of preferred economic activities; and (e) given grazing rights&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-39-&#13;
over the forest area in the vicinity of the project. The implementation of the rehabilitation program has&#13;
been divided into four distinct phases: (a) before construction; (b) during construction; (c) after&#13;
construction; and (d) monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
Framework for Rehabilitation&#13;
5.12        A detailed rehabilitation policy has been framed by EGAT specifically for the Lam&#13;
Takhong Project. The policy, which has been designed with the active participation of the affected&#13;
people, will be implemented by a committee composed of representatives of EGAT, local officials and&#13;
peoples' representatives. The Implementation Plan - Environmental Mitigation and Development,&#13;
January 1994, approved by OEPP and the August 1994 Addendum to the Implementation Plan,&#13;
Environmental Mitigation and Development, by EGAT provide the rehabilitation framework for&#13;
implementation. The following is the list of measures which would assist the affected persons improve&#13;
their existing standards of living:&#13;
(a)   compensation for land at a rate of Baht 103,000/ha;&#13;
(b)   compensation for 18 species of fruit trees at varying rates;&#13;
(c)   improvement of the living conditions in the affected villages before the project starts,&#13;
through: (i) repair (lining) of an existing weir to improve dry season water supply; (ii)&#13;
allocation of budget to village development funds; (iii) establishment of village medicine&#13;
funds; (iv) support of educational activities; (v) support of religious activities at the end of&#13;
construction; and (vi) resurfacing of the 5 km road to the village with asphalt paving;&#13;
(d)   establishment of cooperatives;&#13;
(e)  loaning of up to Baht 250,000 per family through the agricultural cooperatives, for animal&#13;
farming;&#13;
(f)   granting of Baht 2,000 per month for four years to the holder of each of the 74 land&#13;
parcels for animal farming or other initiatives;&#13;
(g)   making available 1,696 ha of adjacent reserve forest for grazing;&#13;
(h)   providing occupational training including EGAT-financed training, at the non-formal&#13;
Education Center in Nakhon Ratchasima, in industrial skills, construction skills, general&#13;
agriculture, weaving, dress making and tailoring;&#13;
(i)   encouraging employment of affected villagers by contractors;&#13;
(j)   providing 0.8 ha to the holder of each of the aforementioned 74 land parcels for&#13;
development of fruit trees;&#13;
(k)   providing nursery stock to establish orchards on 0.8 ha parcels;&#13;
(1)   subsidizing the planting of the nursery stock and the maintenance of the orchards until&#13;
they bear fruit (fifth to tenth years after the start of construction);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
(m)  providing 40,000 m3/yr of water and a drip irrigation system for starting the orchards;&#13;
(n)   providing a 12.8 ha community forest plantation; and&#13;
(o)   employing affected persons to carry out the reforestation of 1,230 ha in the Khao Tien -&#13;
Khao Khuanlan Reserved Forest Area.&#13;
Organizational Arrangements&#13;
5.13       The coordination and supervision of the implementation of the rehabilitation program&#13;
would be carried out by " The Committee for Consideration of Assistance to the Affected People and&#13;
Environmental Development". This committee, chaired by the Governor of Nakhon Ratchasima,&#13;
consists of members from EGAT, the local governments of the concerned districts, the various&#13;
departments involved in implementation of the rehabilitation program and representatives of the affected&#13;
people. To facilitate the process of implementation of the rehabilitation plans, the following sub-&#13;
committees have been formed:&#13;
(a)   Sub-committee for Property Survey.&#13;
(b)   Sub-committee for Inspection and Remittance of Compensation.&#13;
(c)   Sub-committee for Public Relations.&#13;
(d)   Sub-committee for Quality of Life Development and Occupational Promotion.&#13;
5.14       The apex committee would make the decisions related to compensation and rehabilitation&#13;
with the participation of the affected people and local officials. The budgetary implication of these&#13;
decisions would be borne by EGAT which would allocate the required funds to the respective&#13;
departments responsible for implementing specific programs.&#13;
Grievance Redressal&#13;
5.15       Since the process of rehabilitation planming has been carried out with the full participation&#13;
of the affected people, there are not likely to be many instances of serious grievances during&#13;
implementation.  However, in order to ensure that the rehabilitation program is implemented as&#13;
designed and approved by the affected people, the apex committee will have representatives from the&#13;
affected community. Aggrieved persons could apply to the respective committee dealing with the issue&#13;
and the matter will be decided on merit. An affected person dissatisfied by the decision of this&#13;
committee, could appeal to the apex committee headed by the provincial governor.&#13;
Participation&#13;
5.16       EGAT and the local government initiated the process of participation of the affected people&#13;
for planning the rehabilitation program. A "village development committee" was formed almost a year&#13;
before the project was given the final official approval, for discussing the various components of the&#13;
rehabilitation program. A number of community development programs and infrastructure development&#13;
programs were finalized based on these discussions. The various elements of the rehabilitation program&#13;
have emerged from this regular, sustained and participatory process of decision making.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41-&#13;
Budget and Timetable&#13;
5.17       A detailed budget and the agencies responsible for implementing the program are given in&#13;
Annex 15. A budgetary breakdown is given below:&#13;
Name of Plan                           Budget in million Baht&#13;
a. Public Relations Plan:                          10.00&#13;
b. Compensation Plan:                              42.00&#13;
c. Quality of Life Development Plan                21.65&#13;
d. Plan for establishment of cooperatives          24.43&#13;
e. Occupational Promotional Plan                   23.87&#13;
f. Land Allocation Plan                             7.00&#13;
g. Socio-economic monitoring Plan                   2.50&#13;
Total                                        131.45&#13;
5.18       Adequate provision has been made for contingency funds in the main Lam Takhong&#13;
Project. If any of the rehabilitation programs require greater funds than originally anticipated, the&#13;
contingency funds from the main project would be drawn upon for the purpose.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
5.19       The rehabilitation plans would be monitored both internally and externally. Internal&#13;
monitoring would be done by the apex provincial committee and the Lam Takhong project office in&#13;
EGAT.  Progress in implementing various components would be reported to the Office of&#13;
Environmental Policy and Planning and to the office of the National Economic and Social Development&#13;
Board.  These organizations would monitor and evaluate the progress through periodic reports&#13;
submitted by the project office and through regular field visits. Monitoring of the rehabilitation&#13;
program would include, inter alia, payment of compensation, providing membership to affected persons&#13;
in cooperatives, allocation of land, income levels of rehabilitated persons and employment of affected&#13;
persons in various activities.&#13;
D. Transmission Lines&#13;
5.20       Environmental investigation of the transmission lines covered by the project (Phase I) was&#13;
completed by Khon Kaen University in December 1992. The lines will require a Right of Way (ROW)&#13;
of 27.3 ha that includes 6.3 ha of Watershed Class 4B land, 7.8 ha of Class 2B land, 12.6 ha of Class&#13;
2A land and 4.4 ha of Class lB land. The line will traverse 1.8 km of agricultural land, 5.0 km of&#13;
degraded forest and 0.15 km of second growth forest. There are no dwellings within or near this&#13;
proposed ROW.&#13;
5.21       The following would be the criteria for compensation for those affected by transmission&#13;
lines. These criteria are acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42-&#13;
(a)   Paddy field or cultivated land in the ROW  - 50%  of the determined value (i.e.&#13;
replacement value) and the user would be permitted to continue cultivation.&#13;
(b)   Orchard/farm land in the ROW  - 70% of the determined value and the user would be&#13;
permitted to continue other cultivation such as cash crop.&#13;
(c)   Residential land in the ROW - 90% of the determined value and the dwelling would have&#13;
to vacate from the ROW. Structures within the ROW will be paid with replacement value&#13;
(including dismantling cost, transfer cost and the cost of reconstruction).&#13;
(d)   Tower location - 100% of the determined value and the user or occupant would have to&#13;
vacate the premises.&#13;
(e)   Perennial trees - the compensation will include breeding cost, planting, fostering and&#13;
opportunity cost as appropriate.&#13;
5.22       The representatives of the affected people would be members of the committees and sub-&#13;
committees formed for planting and implementing the compensation and rehabilitation program. If any&#13;
of the affected people are aggrieved by the rehabilitation process, they could register their appeals to the&#13;
committee responsible for receiving complaints and petitions.&#13;
5.23       Environmental investigation of the Phase II transmission lines is currently in progress and&#13;
scheduled to be completed in June 1995. ROW requirements of the Phase II transmission lines will&#13;
become available in February 1995. At negotiations, agreement was reached with EGAT that Phase II&#13;
transmission lines would be constructed only after the environmental investigation reports and necessary&#13;
mitigation measures have been approved by the OEPP and reviewed by the Bank.&#13;

6.2              During the period FY89-93, EGAT's energy sales grew  at an annual average of about&#13;
14%, from 33,701 GWh in FY89 to 56,558 GWh in FY93. Since 1989, EGAT has experienced high&#13;
growth rates in energy sales attributable to rapid industrial expansion, progressing rural electrification&#13;
and people's changing lifestyles.&#13;
6.3              EGAT's financial results for the last five years show that it is a profitable and efficient&#13;
organization. Its self-financing ratio and the rate of return on net revalued assets in operation have&#13;
remained relatively high throughout the FY89-93 period, averaging 31 % and 8.7%, respectively.&#13;
6.4              The introduction of the value added tax (VAT) in January 1, 1992 had a significant effect&#13;
on EGAT's operations. When VAT was introduced, the prices of energy sold by EGAT were maintained&#13;
at previous levels and were not increased by the 7 % VAT charge. The sales price therefore became VAT&#13;
inclusive and EGAT had to account for the VAT as a tax on output so that sales revenue suffered&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-&#13;
accordingly. With effect from October 1, 1991 (i.e., FY92), the Government agreed to a new tariff&#13;
structure that would allow EGAT to make sales price adjustments if there were increases in its costs as&#13;
a result of VAT and increases in fuel prices. However, the Government requested that no adjustments&#13;
be made on the tariff until June 1, 1992, by which time the full effects of the introduction of the VAT&#13;
would have been known.&#13;
6.5           Despite the negative effect of the VAT on EGAT's revenues, two factors compensated&#13;
for this so that EGAT was still able to achieve a healthy financial performance in FY92. First, additional&#13;
revenues of Baht 646 million, Baht 748 million and Baht 848 million were earned by EGAT, MEA and&#13;
PEA, respectively, because of the favorable change in actual consumption pattern as opposed to that&#13;
expected in the pricing plan envisaged in the new tariff structure. As part of the overall deal to&#13;
compensate EGAT for the loss of revenue during the months of January to May 1992, the Ministry of&#13;
Finance (MOF) agreed that Baht 1.5 billion of the additional revenues earned by MEA and PEA should&#13;
be passed to EGAT. Second, the business tax, which had been paid on most materials, was abolished&#13;
and replaced by VAT enabling EGAT to claim it back as tax on input.&#13;
6.6          In accordance with regulations applicable to state enterprises, EGAT is liable to remit a&#13;
proportion of its net income to the MOF at a level determined at year's end according to the needs of the&#13;
National Treasury. EGAT's practice is to reflect these remittances as a reduction to retained earnings&#13;
rather than an income tax because EGAT considers remittances as an appropriation of net income (similar&#13;
to dividends) rather than a tax on profit. At the middle of the year, the Goverment advises EGAT a&#13;
preliminary figure to be remitted; EGAT is assessed a final amount to be paid only when its books are&#13;
closed. These remittances have been variable ranging from 5% to 20% of net profit. In FY93, MOF&#13;
decided to call for a remittance of 30% and EGAT made this contribution in FY94.&#13;
B. Present Financial Position&#13;
6.7           During FY93, EGAT experienced an increase in energy sales of 11 % over FY92 or from&#13;
50.8 GWh in FY92 to 56.6 GWh in FY93. Of the 56.6 GWh sales volume, 53% was sold to PEA, 44%&#13;
to MEA, 3 % to direct customers, and the remainder to EDL (Laos), TNB (Malaysia), and other minor&#13;
customers. Energy sales in FY93 to PEA increased strongly by 14% from FY92, as a result of the&#13;
growing industrial development in provincial areas and the Government's commitment to pursue its rural&#13;
electrification program. The larger share and rapid increase of EGAT's total electricity sales to PEA&#13;
had a sharp effect on EGAT's income since the rate of energy sold to PEA was much lower than the&#13;
average sales price to MEA and PEA. According to the new electricity tariff, EGAT's unit sales price&#13;
to PEA and MEA further declined; the sales price to PEA in particular, dropped 2% from 97.47&#13;
stangs/kWh in FY92 to 96.30 stangs/kWh in FY93 (1 Baht = 100 stangs). The lower sales price to PEA&#13;
coupled with increasing rate of demand which has surpassed MEA's for several past years resulted in a&#13;
decrease in the average selling price and consequently, slower growth of EGAT's sales revenues.&#13;
6.8           EGAT's operating revenue for FY93 showed an increase of Baht 5.9 billion or 10% over&#13;
FY92. EGAT's average tariff consists of a basic tariff and an adjustment factor (Ft). The Ft, which&#13;
essentially is an adjustment on the basic tariff to account for changes in fuel price, was introduced in June&#13;
1992 and is applied whenever there is a difference between the actual and target costs of generation of&#13;
more than 2 stangs per kWh. The increase in operating revenues was mainly attributable to the increase&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45-&#13;
in electricity demand though offset by a reduction in the basic tariff of about 2.7% from Baht 1.15 in&#13;
FY92 to Baht 1.12 in FY93. While there was a 22 % rise in the Ft from Baht 0.06/kWh in FY92 to Baht&#13;
0.08/kWh in FY93, average tariff (including Ft) dropped from Baht 1.22 to Baht 1.20 for the same&#13;
period. While VAT and land and property tax adjustments were made during the year, some of these&#13;
costs were absorbed by EGAT and not passed on to the consumers. So far, no adjustments have been&#13;
made for demand side management costs (also allowed in Ft) since no significant costs have been&#13;
incurred.&#13;
6.9           During FY93, total energy generated by EGAT exceeded its budgeted figure but all of&#13;
this excess had to be generated using fuel oil, which is relatively expensive. Hydro generation was&#13;
severely affected by the drought (in certain reservoirs, the water was at its lowest level), and power&#13;
generated by plants using lignite was below budgeted and previous levels mainly due to the environmental&#13;
problems at Mae Moh. Some problems were also experienced with the gas supply from PTT at&#13;
Namphong which was not as plentiful as originally estimated. These shortfalls had to be made up by&#13;
plants using fuel oil. As a result, despite falling oil and gas prices, fuel expenses increased from Baht&#13;
31.9 billion in FY92 to Baht 34.6 billion in FY93, or by 8%.&#13;
6.10          Other operating expenses in FY93 increased by 18% from FY92 levels principally&#13;
because of: (a) an increase in expenses of transmission, engineering and generation on account of several&#13;
new plants coming into service; and (b) the full impact of the increase in the salary structure which took&#13;
effect in April 1992. Nevertheless, EGAT posted operating and net incomes of Baht 12 billion and Baht&#13;
8.1 billion, respectively, for FY93, slightly reduced from those of the previous year of Baht 11.9 billion&#13;
and Baht 9.1 billion, respectively.&#13;
6.11         EGAT's foreign exchange gains and losses on loan repayments arise as a result of&#13;
differences in exchange rates between year end and at the date of loan repayments. As of September&#13;
1993, EGAT's long term debts of Baht 117.2 billion (net of current maturities) were denominated half&#13;
in US Dollars and the other half in Japanese Yen, German Mark and Swiss Franc. During the year, the&#13;
Baht weakened against the Dollar and the Yen, but strengthened against the Mark and the Franc. The&#13;
losses on foreign exchange which EGAT charged to its FY93 operations were similar to the previous&#13;
year, amounting to Baht 2.1 billion.&#13;
6.12          EGAT revalues foreign currency loans as of September 30 of each year, and spreads the&#13;
loss over the remaining terms of the loans to a deferred foreign exchange adjustment account. The&#13;
amount written off to deferred foreign exchange adjustment account increased by approximately 4 % over&#13;
FY92. Even with the increase in EGAT's long term debt as a result of the inclusion of the deferred&#13;
foreign exchange account, its debt to equity ratio remained well below the covenanted ratio set in&#13;
previous Bank agreements at 60:40.&#13;
6.13          EGAT's financial position remained healthy on the strength of continued increases in&#13;
revenues accumulated over the years. The self-financing ratio based on a three-year average capital&#13;
expenditures on power, irrigation, mine and development, has been declining from the previous high&#13;
levels of FY89-91 because of substantial capital investments which have grown on average at about 39%&#13;
from Baht 11.8 billion in FY89 to Baht 31.8 billion in FY93. As capital expenditures have grown,&#13;
EGAT's revalued rate base of net fixed assets for power has also increased from Baht 95.5 billion in&#13;
FY89 to Baht 184.3 billion in FY93. As a result, the rate of return on revalued rate base has declined&#13;
from 12% in FY89 to 5.5% in FY93. Other factors also contributed to this trend, particularly in FY92&#13;
and FY93, when the rate of return had deteriorated to 6.7% and 5.5%, respectively. First, the increase&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
in the remittance rate to the Government from  15% to 20%  in FY92 and from 20 %  to 30%  in FY93 has&#13;
resulted in significant reductions to operating income. Second, the index used to revalue EGAT's net&#13;
fixed assets to arrive at the rate base has had a distorting effect. The FY92-93 net fixed assets were&#13;
revalued on the basis of very high deflators provided by the Government in February 1992. Subsequent&#13;
revisions, however, were made to these deflators in January 1994 which showed lower indices for FY92-&#13;
93 and consequently, slower increases in EGAT's revalued fixed assets.&#13;
C. Financial Outlook&#13;
6.14             The healthy financial performance of EGAT is expected to continue for the next several&#13;
years. Projections of EGAT's financial performance for the period FY94-2001 and the assumptions&#13;
underlying these projections are presented in Annex 17. Key financial indicators are presented in Table&#13;

a! Internal cash generation less debt service expressed as a percentage of three years' average capital&#13;
expenditure on power, irrigation, mine and development.&#13;
6.15             EGAT's  capital investment expenditure averaged Baht 17 billion per year in the Sixth&#13;
Plan (FY87-91), and is expected to substantially increase to Baht 50.2 billion in the Seventh Plan (FY92-&#13;
96), and to Baht 117.2 billion in the Eight Plan (FY97-200 1). About 52%  of this expenditure would be&#13;
in foreign currency. At the same time, EGAT is committed to complying with the Government's policy&#13;
of keeping public investment under control, encouraging private sector participation in energy&#13;
development, and conforming with the ceiling on annual public foreign borrowing imposed by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
Government. EGAT is therefore examining various alternatives to finance this very large investment&#13;
program and has planned partial divestiture as a fund raising option to meet future capital requirements.&#13;
6.16          From 1995 to the year 2001, EGAT's projected foreign currency denominated loan and&#13;
interest repayments are projected to increase from Baht 12,700 billion to Baht 55,750 billion. A&#13;
sensitivity analysis of the projections was done to test the effect of a 5 % fluctuation of the Yen and the&#13;
Mark on EGAT's financials. The results show that even with substantial increases in EGAT's foreign&#13;
currency obligations, the self-financing ratio remains within the 25% ratio agreed with the Bank. The&#13;
debt service coverage ratio will deteriorate but will still remain above 1.0 times (ranging from 1.04 to&#13;
1.71 times). While EGAT's financial position continues to be strong, the current ratio has been declining&#13;
in the past several years, and the decline is projected to continue until 2001. The decline is due to a&#13;
substantial increase in current liabilities, including current maturities on account of EGAT's heavy&#13;
investment program. Revised financial projections provided by EGAT at negotiations, show substantially&#13;
improved results with current ratios exceeding 1.0 times being achieved in the outer years of the forecast&#13;
(year 2000 and beyond) on account of additional cash and a decline in current maturities expected from&#13;
EGAT's sale of a second power plant and the participation of IPPs in its power development plan.&#13;
6.17          While EGAT's financial prospects continue to be bright, the challenge for EGAT in the&#13;
near term is to be able to finance a high level of capital investments contemplated until 2001 and at the&#13;
same time maintain an acceptable level of self-financing to be achieved for the next several years.&#13;
EGAT's projections show that an acceptable level of self-financing can be achieved from FY95-2001.&#13;
However, such a level can only be achieved in FY94 if EGAT is able to proceed with the proposed sale&#13;
of its power plants (para. 1.32). Acceptable levels of self-financing would be sustained if EGAT&#13;
acquires Good State Enterprise (GSE) status and maintains tariffs consistent with its financial objectives.&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that it will take measures, including&#13;
but not necessarily limited to setting tariff levels, so as to generate funds from internal sources equivalent&#13;
to not less than 25% of the annual average of its capital expenditures incurred, or expected to be&#13;
incurred, for that fiscal year, the previous fiscal year, and the next following fiscal year.&#13;
6.18          The projected income statements are based on the assumption that EGAT would be able&#13;
to increase tariffs in FY95 by 9% and that the power plant at Rayong would be privatized. It is&#13;
envisaged that the fixed assets at Rayong would be transferred to EGCO who would operate the plant and&#13;
sell power to EGAT. The price at which this power would be sold has not yet been agreed but it is&#13;
assumed that the price paid by EGAT would be sufficient to provide EGCO with an internal rate of&#13;
return on equity (IRR) of 20%. It is assumed that the EGCO selling price would be about Baht&#13;
1. 15/kWh which is higher than EGAT's production cost because EGCO will pay more in capital funding&#13;
costs and insurance premiums and require an IRR of 20%. It is further assumed that EGAT would&#13;
recover the effect of power purchased from Rayong in the sale price adjustment (Ft) and that the proceeds&#13;
from the sale would be used for other capital investment rather than the repayment of loans which&#13;
financed the building of the plant. The loans would therefore remain in EGAT's books. It is expected&#13;
that other plants would also be offered for sale to EGCO including Khanom combined cycle plant in&#13;
FY95.&#13;
6.19          Because privatization of the Rayong plant has been delayed, EGAT will operate the plant&#13;
until about end-FY95. Although the delay would not have an appreciable effect on EGAT's income&#13;
statement, a delay in receiving the sale proceeds will have implications on EGAT's capital expenditure&#13;
program and financing. The longer the sale is delayed, the smaller EGAT's other income would become.&#13;
This is because both interest on the sale proceeds and the EGCO profit from which EGAT takes a share&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
would be reduced. EGAT has advised the MOF that unless the proceeds from the sale are forthcoming,&#13;
it will need to make alternative funding arrangements.&#13;
6.20          EGAT's projected financial ratios are expected to be satisfactory. The debt service&#13;
coverage would range between 1.1 to 1.8 times throughout the projected period. The capital structure&#13;
would also be more than adequate with long term debts not exceeding 1.3 times equity or a comfortable&#13;
ratio of 57/43. EGAT's current debt control test provides for Bank review of borrowing when the debt&#13;
to equity ratio exceeds 1.5 times or 60/40 level. To ensure that measures are taken to maintain EGAT's&#13;
strong capital structure, during negotiations, agreement was reached with EGAT that further debts would&#13;
not be incurred if such additional debt would raise its total long term indebtedness to more than 1.5 times&#13;
of its total capitalization. Under previous loans, EGAT was also required not to contract short- and&#13;
medium-term debt (debt which matures within five years) in excess of 15% of its total debt outstanding.&#13;
EGAT has always complied with this covenant, and at negotiations, it was agreed that compliance of this&#13;
limit would be continued under the proposed loan.&#13;
6.21          The cash flow forecast shows a net outflow of funds of about Baht 86 billion to Baht 262&#13;
billion throughout the projected period and these will be met largely out of existing cash reserves and&#13;
borrowings. The forecast includes a source of funds of Baht 17 billion in FY94 on the sale of the&#13;
Rayong plant to EGCO. EGAT's cash flow projections, however, do not show other sources which may&#13;
materialize during the projected period, particularly possible sale of other power plants and investments&#13;
by IPPs (paras. 1.34 - 1.35) sometime in FY98.&#13;
D. Lignite Mine Department&#13;
Operations&#13;
6.22         The Lignite Mining Sector, which is treated as a separate profit center, comprises the Mae&#13;
Moh and Krabi mines. The Lignite Mine Accounting Division maintains accounting records to enable&#13;
the results of the lignite mining operations and the production cost of lignite to be recorded separately.&#13;
As the electricity tariff is closely linked to fuel costs, the charge to EGAT for lignite is made at an&#13;
economic transfer price which is reviewed annually. The transfer price of lignite is recalculated at the&#13;
beginning of the year based on a formula established by consultants, Meta Systems Inc., which has been&#13;
agreed with the Bank. The transfer price reflects the long-run marginal cost of lignite and is equal to the&#13;
sum of EGAT mining costs and a depletion premium that accounts for the increasing economic scarcity&#13;
value of lignite and the associated cost to the economy of the early use of an exhaustible resource. The&#13;
depletion premium is derived from the opportunity cost of lignite (based on imported coal as a substitute),&#13;
future mining costs and the magnitude of reserves. Agreement was reached during negotiations that&#13;
EGAT would continue to set the transfer price for the lignite produced and used in the power plants on&#13;
the basis of economic principles and so as to ensure the financial viability of its lignite mine operations,&#13;
in accordance with the methodology previously agreed with the Bank.&#13;
Finances&#13;
6.23         In FY93 EGAT raised funds through the issue of EGAT bonds and a loan from the&#13;
Government Savings Bank. Part of these borrowings, amounting to Baht 1.07 billion, were allocated to&#13;
the Lignite Mining Sector and are shown on its balance sheet although not all of the funds had been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-&#13;
utilized by FY93. The Lignite Mining Sector does not have a bank account and accordingly the&#13;
unutilized funds of Baht 1.02 billion are included in the internal funding account which relatively reduces&#13;
its equity. This had a significant impact on the debt equity ratio of EGAT; if the surplus funds were held&#13;
in the bank account of the Lignite Mining Sector, the debt equity ratio would only be approximately 1:1.&#13;
6.24         The financial performance of the Lignite Mining Sector has been satisfactory. It has&#13;
consistently complied with the debt covenants set under previous Bank loans. As of September 1993,&#13;
its debt:equity ratio is at 1.29:1 and its debt service coverage ratio is at 1.75 times.&#13;
E. Tariff Levels and Structure&#13;
6.25          EGAT sells power to the distribution utilities, MEA and PEA, at wholesale rates. The&#13;
approach used in setting tariff for end-use consumers of MEA and PEA is on the basis of long-run&#13;
marginal cost pricing but takes account of equity, social and developmental considerations. The tariffs&#13;
ensure that sufficient revenues are generated to cover the combined revenue requirement of all the three&#13;
utilities, EGAT, MEA and PEA. For rationalization of the bulk supply tariff see para. 4.14 and Annex&#13;
10.&#13;
6.26          According to agreements reached under Loan 2915-TH (Power Transmission Project)&#13;
concerning adjustments in the then existing tariff structure, a new electricity tariff was announced and&#13;
took effect in December 1991. Individual rate categories were reduced from 15 to 8: small residential,&#13;
large residential, small general service, medium general service, large general service, specific business,&#13;
government institutions and non-profit organizations, and agricultural pumping. Annex 18 gives the&#13;
current tariff schedule. An automatic adjustment clause, allowing the utilities to adjust the rates to&#13;
comply with changes of costs beyond the utilities' control, was also included in the revised tariff. The&#13;
clause allows for adjustment in the price if there are increases/decreases in the costs due to fuel prices,&#13;
land and property taxes, demand side management, and VAT.&#13;
6.27         The differences in cost at various voltage levels are taken into account in determining&#13;
individual tariff rates. Three forms of tariffs are currently being applied: (a) energy charges alone; (b)&#13;
demand charges with energy charges; and (c) time-of-day (TOD) rates. TOD tariffs for consumers with&#13;
a demand of greater than 2,000 kW have been in effect since 1991. However, efforts were made to&#13;
introduce TOD tariffs to consumers with demand in excess of 30 kW and energy in excess of 355,000&#13;
kWh per month since December 1992. Implementation of TOD tariffs for medium general service&#13;
consumers was completed in FY93.&#13;
6.28         The electricity tariffs are set by a tariff setting committee composed of EGAT, MEA,&#13;
PEA, MOF, NEPO and NIDA. The committee meets monthly to determine the automatic adjustment&#13;
factor and prepares recommendations to the NEPC on the proposed tariff increases during the tariff&#13;
setting period every three years.&#13;
6.29         Table 6.3 below shows the average rate levels in current prices that would be necessary&#13;
for EGAT to achieve an acceptable level of self financing for the next several years.&#13;

F. Financing Plan&#13;
6.30           The financing plan for EGAT over the FY94-95 period is presented in Table 6.4. The&#13;
proposed project, including interest during construction, represents 27% of EGAT's total investment&#13;
program during the FY94-95 period. The proposed Bank loan of US$100 million is expected to meet&#13;
10% of EGAT's total financing requirements for the period. During the FY94-95 period, EGAT expects&#13;
to meet 21 % of its total capital requirements from internally generated funds. This is lower than 25%&#13;
(the level required under the self-financing ratio covenant) because the covenant is based on a three-year&#13;
average investment and EGAT's investments are substantially higher (by 71 %) in FY94-95 than in FY93.&#13;
EGAT's detailed investment program from FY95 to FY99 is presented in Annex 19. The program shows&#13;
that EGAT's required investments including IDC for these five years amount to a total of US$11.4 billion&#13;
or about US$2.2 billion per year. This figure does not take into account investments in the power&#13;
subsector to be made by IPPs. However, the program includes power plants which EGAT will build but&#13;
eventually sell to EGCO or other subsidiaries. EGAT has in the past been able to raise the required&#13;
financing and implement an investment program of this magnitude.&#13;

6.31          Borrowing from external sources amount to only 47% of EGAT's financing requirements&#13;
for FY94-95 as a large proportion (32%) of cash sources would be coming from the sale of the Rayong&#13;
power plant. EGAT has not experienced any difficulties in the past in securing bilateral financing,&#13;
suppliers credits, and commercial loans. EGAT has made use of and will continue to use Bank, OECF,&#13;
and other bilateral funds; export credits; commercial syndicated loans; and local bonds to cover any&#13;
financing gap.&#13;

Chapter VII&#13;
Project Justification&#13;
A. Economic Analysis&#13;
7.1          EGAT's power development plan, which is supported in part by the proposed loan, is&#13;
critical to the continued growth and industrialization of Thailand. Its timely implementation is essential&#13;
to meeting the growing demands of power by industry, commerce and residential consumers.&#13;
Economic analyses were performed both for EGAT's investment program and for the Lam Takhong&#13;
Pump Storage project.&#13;
EGAT's Investment Program&#13;
7.2          To confirm the economic viability of EGAT's power development plan (PDP) the&#13;
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) was calculated on the basis of the incremental cost and benefit streams&#13;
associated with the 1991-2000 time-slice of EGAT's overall investment program. This period covers&#13;
about 5,500 MW of gas-fired combined cycle plant based on present reserve estimates of domestic&#13;
natural gas, about 5,300 MW of conventioned thermal plant (coal/oil/gas), about 1,500 MW of lignite-&#13;
fired capacity, and about 1,800 MW of peaking hydro, pump storage and gas turbine capacity.&#13;
Incremental fuel costs are based on economic prices for natural gas, lignite, fuel oil and diesel oil as&#13;
estimated by NEPO and given in Annex 20. The projected levels of EGAT tariffs producing the&#13;
minimum covenanted 25% self-financing ratio are used as a proxy for benefits, ignoring possible&#13;
consumer surplus. The ERR on the expansion program is 12%. Details of the calculations are given in&#13;
Annex 21.&#13;
Lam Takhong Pump Storage Project&#13;
7.3          The pump storage units would not only provide the much needed peaking power for the&#13;
Thai grid at least cost, but would considerably improve the system's dynamic performance enabling it&#13;
to meet rapidly changing loads, while optimizing output from its generators. This benefit is significant&#13;
but difficult to quantify and, conservatively, no attempt has been made to do so.&#13;
7.4          EGAT has carried out detailed computer simulations of its least-cost development plan&#13;
using: (a) the 4x250 MW Lam Takhong Pump Storage scheme; and (b) the next best altemative of&#13;
internal combustion turbines of which lIx 100 MW units were required to achieve the same loss of load&#13;
probability as Lam Takhong. These simulations have shown that the pumping energy for Lam Takhong&#13;
would be supplied during off-peak hours by the highly efficient dual fuel (oil/gas) 600 MW&#13;
conventional thermal units in the system. The lignite and coal fired thermal plants and the gas fired&#13;
combined cycle plants would be fully committed to supply the system's base load energy. As the&#13;
reserves of indigenous gas are fully committed, the marginal fuel for both alternatives would be heavy&#13;
fuel oil. However, as the combustion turbines cannot burn heavy fuel oil, gas is assumed to be diverted&#13;
from the dual fuel (oil/gas) conventional thermal units, which would burn correspondingly higher&#13;
quantities of heavy fuel oil. If these combustion turbines cannot be installed near locations where&#13;
natural gas supplies are already available, they would have to bum costly diesel oil or the project would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
entail a heavy cost for the extension of gas pipe lines. Conservatively, it is assumed that it would be&#13;
feasible to instal the combustion turbines near already established gas supplies.&#13;
7.5           The overall efficiency of the pump storage scheme which includes transmission losses&#13;
during pumping is estimated at 70%. Thus for an annual energy generation of 989 Gwh from the pump&#13;
storage plant, the pumping energy requirement is 1,412 Gwh. The heat rates of the large conventional&#13;
thermal units are: 9.04 cft/kWh for gas and 0.23 I/kWh for heavy fuel oil. The heat rates for the&#13;
combustion turbines are 11.62 cft/kWh for gas and 0.33 1/kWh for diesel oil.&#13;
7.6           Investment costs of the pump storage scheme and the next best alternative of internal&#13;
combustion turbines are based on constant 1994 prices, exclusive of duties and taxes and interest during&#13;
construction (Annex 22).  The cost of environmental impact mitigation and compensation (to&#13;
maintain/increase the standard of livelihood of the affected people) are fully considered for Lam&#13;
Takhong. Operation and maintenance costs are assumed at 1.0%, 3.0%, and 1.5%, respectively, of the&#13;
capital costs for hydro plant, internal combustion turbines and transmission system. The economic lives&#13;
of the facilities are assumed as: (a) internal combustion turbines - 20 years; (b) hydro-electric&#13;
machinery - 20 years; (c) civil works - 50 years; and (c) transmission system  - 33 years.  The&#13;
incremental quantity of fuel oil for the pump storage scheme as compared to internal combustion&#13;
turbines is derived from actual simulation of the system operation.&#13;
7.7           Details of the economic analysis for the base case are presented in Annex 23. The&#13;
equalizing discount rate (at which the present values of the cost and benefit streams become equal), is&#13;
computed at 16%. This is above the threshold discount rate of 10% stipulated by NESDB for project&#13;
acceptability. Sensitivity analysis for variation in various relevant parameters gives the following values&#13;
for the equalizing discount rate. This shows that the project continues to remain economically viable&#13;
under possible, though unlikely, adverse conditions.&#13;
Case                                       ERR&#13;
Base                                       16%&#13;
Capital cost of Lam Takhong&#13;
increased by 10%                         13%&#13;
Price of fuel oil escalated&#13;
at 3% p.a. for the entire&#13;
project life                             15%&#13;
Combustion turbines using diesel&#13;
oil instead of gas                       20%&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
7.8           The project faces risks generally associated with any hydro project - cost and schedule&#13;
overruns due to geological and hydrological uncertainties, and contractor and construction supervision&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-54-&#13;
inadequacies. Geological risk is small due to the uniform nature of the site geology and has been&#13;
further lessened by very comprehensive site testing and investigations. Hydrological uncertainties are&#13;
low since hydrology of the Lam Takhong River has been well established and the project actually&#13;
consumes no water. Flood risk is low since the small amount of work needed in the reservoir would be&#13;
carried out in the dry season, and sudden rises in the reservoir water level could be prevented by&#13;
operation of the outlet works. Care has been taken in the perqualification process to ensure a fully&#13;
qualified contractor and the full involvement of experienced international consultants in construction&#13;
supervision would reduce the project management risks to a minimum. Finally, EGAT's excellent track&#13;
record in overall management of hydro projects and its state of preparedness gives a substantial degree&#13;
of assurance for timely completion of the project.&#13;

Chapter VIII&#13;
Agreements Reached and Recommendation&#13;
A. Agreements&#13;
8.1          During negotiations, agreement was reached:&#13;
With EGAT that it would:&#13;
(a)    carry out an annual review and update of its 5-year investment program and related&#13;
financing plan and exchange views with the Bank and the Government on the said&#13;
program (para. 2.8);&#13;
(b)    submit to the Bank audited annual financial statements for the mining operations and&#13;
EGAT as a whole, within six months of the close of each fiscal year (para. 3.21);&#13;
(c)    under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank, cause the upper reservoir dam to be&#13;
periodically inspected in accordance with sound engineering practice in order to&#13;
determine whether there are any deficiencies in the condition of this structure, or in the&#13;
quality and adequacy of maintenance or methods of operations of the same, which may&#13;
endanger its safety (para. 4.18);&#13;
(d)    carry out the Environmental Impact Mitigation and Rehabilitation Plans as set forth in&#13;
the documents: (i) Implementation Plan - Environmental Mitigation and Development,&#13;
January 1994, by OEPP; and (ii) August 1994, Addendum to the Implementation Plan,&#13;
Environmental Mitigation and Development, by EGAT, including provision of&#13;
necessary budget, appointment of committees for managing and supervising&#13;
implementation and agencies for monitoring and evaluation (para. 5.1);&#13;
(e)    construct the Phase II transmission lines only after the environmental investigation&#13;
reports and necessary mitigation measures have been approved by OEPP and reviewed&#13;
by the Bank (para 5.23);&#13;
(f)    maintain a debt/equity ratio not exceeding 60:40 and short- and medium-term debt at no&#13;
more than 15% of all debt outstanding (para. 6.20);&#13;
(g)    continue to operate its lignite mining activities as separate profit center by maintaining&#13;
separate accounts and financial statements; set the transfer price of lignite produced and&#13;
used on the basis of appropriate economic and financial criteria in accordance with&#13;
methodology previously agreed with the Bank (para. 6.22).&#13;
With EGAT and the Government that:&#13;
EGAT would undertake a study for the rationalization of the bulk supply tariff,&#13;
according to terms of reference agreed with the Bank, and promptly thereafter, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-56-&#13;
Government will review with the Bank the recommendations of that study and&#13;
implement the said recommendations taking into account the Bank's views (para. 4.14).&#13;
With the Government that it would:&#13;
undertake a periodic review of power rates to ensure that tariffs are adequate for EGAT&#13;
to produce funds from internal sources equivalent to not less than 25 % of the annual&#13;
average of its capital expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred, by them for&#13;
that fiscal year, the previous fiscal year, and the next following fiscal year (para. 6.17).&#13;
B. Recommendation&#13;
8.2           On the basis of the agreements outlined above, the proposed project is suitable for a&#13;
Bank loan of US$100 million equivalent to EGAT with the guarantee of the Kingdom of Thailand at the&#13;
Bank's standard variable interest rate for a 17-year term including a 5-year grace period on repayment&#13;
of principal.&#13;

Lam Takhong Pump Storage Project&#13;
Demand-Side Management Program&#13;
Background&#13;
1.          In 1992, the Government of Thailand (GOT) approved legislation establishing the Energy&#13;
Conservation Promotion Act, which increased the GOT commitment and resources to implement a&#13;
comprehensive energy efficiency program. In 1993, the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) provided&#13;
a grant to fund the Thailand Promotion of Electricity Efficiency Project (GEF Project). The objective&#13;
of the GEF Project is to demonstrate on a large scale and within a reasonable timeframe (a) the potential&#13;
for electricity savings to replace substantial future power generation in Thailand, thereby reducing future&#13;
CO2 (and nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide) emissions, and (b) the capability of the electric power sector&#13;
and other relevant agencies to achieve projected savings. The GEF Project is funding a slice of the&#13;
GOT's Five-Year (1993-1997) US$189 million Demand-Side Management Plan (DSMP) and has as its&#13;
primary focus the demonstration of specific energy efficient technologies in the residential, commercial&#13;
and industrial sectors to achieve the required energy savings over the Project period.&#13;
2.           The DSMP has a savings target of 238 MW and 1,427 GWh of electricity per annum by&#13;
the end of 1997. The Project has a four-pronged approach: (a) provision of user and manufacturer&#13;
incentives and consumer education to direct practices and attitudes toward energy efficient technologies;&#13;
(b) development of efficiency standards and testing capabilities to exercise control and monitor efficiency&#13;
improvements; (c) development and promulgation of building and appliance codes to allow for the&#13;
enforcement of minimum standards; and (d) continued pursuit of technological improvements and&#13;
adaptation to Thai conditions.&#13;
3.           The aforementioned DSMP is being implemented by the Electricity Generating Authority&#13;
of Thailand (EGAT), which has the legal mandate and the authority to pursue all facets of acquiring&#13;
electricity DSM resources. Within EGAT, DSM program implementation is the responsibility of the&#13;
DSM Office (DSMO), with a current staffing level of 60 people.&#13;
Demand-Side Management Implementation&#13;
4.           The DSMP includes programs for three main segments of the market - the residential,&#13;
commercial and industrial sectors.  The Residential programs focus on both manufacturers and&#13;
consumers: incentives to manufacturers to stimulate the production and supply of energy efficient&#13;
equipment and to customers to encourage the purchase of more efficient equipment. All programs are&#13;
in the design phase or early stage of implementation.&#13;
5.           The Lighting Program. The primary focus of the lighting program to date has been to&#13;
promote high efficiency fluorescent tubes (36 watt and 18 watt) to replace standard fluorescent tubes (40&#13;
watt and 20 watt). Since more than 40 million fluorescent tubes are sold each year in Thailand,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

approximately 100 MW peak demand reduction is projected from this program by 1997. EGAT already&#13;
reached an agreement with 5 major lighting equipment manufacturers in Thailand to stop the production&#13;
of standard tubes by September 1995. The five lighting equipment manufacturers represent a combined&#13;
market share of 95 percent. In addition, a program to offer incentives to encourage the consumption and&#13;
the production of low-loss magnetic ballasts is under development.&#13;
6.            The Refrigerator/Air Conditioner Rebate Program.  Beginning January 1, 1995, each&#13;
refrigerator (size 5-6 cu. ft.) sold will have a label indicating an efficiency rating, level of annual KWh&#13;
use, and cost of electricity consumption. This pilot program will provide to the purchasers of high&#13;
efficiency refrigerators a coupon that is redeemable for a cash rebate by sending it to EGAT. The rebate&#13;
is expected to cover a part of the incremental cost of high efficiency refrigerators. Peak demand savings&#13;
of 27 MW and energy savings of 186 GWh per annum are anticipated from this program by the end of&#13;
1997. A similar program for air conditioner is envisaged for implementation in early 1995. In the latter&#13;
phase of the five-year program, incentives will be replaced by standards and codes that will establish and&#13;
enforce minimum levels of efficiencies for equipment.&#13;
7.           In the Commercial sector, the program component aims to influence existing commercial&#13;
and governmental establishments to retrofit/replace existing lighting systems with more efficient systems,&#13;
by offering free lighting audits and rebates for lighting component and system replacement and retrofit.&#13;
To date, lighting retrofits have been performed in eight public buildings. In addition, EGAT has&#13;
launched an energy audit program targeted specifically for department stores. There exist approximately&#13;
80 large department stores in Bangkok, and seven of them participated in the energy audits to date.&#13;
EGAT is also planning to expand the program to hotels and hospitals.&#13;
8.           Another commercial program, in an early planning stage, is a new commercial buildings&#13;
program which would provide incentives for the design of energy efficient buildings. Improvements in&#13;
building design will be achieved through the provision of design services and training for architects and&#13;
engineers; the payment of some portion of the incremental cost of more energy efficient systems for&#13;
pioneering pilot programs; and the ultimate phasing out of such incentives over time through development&#13;
and promulgation of building codes to establish maximum levels of building energy usage.&#13;
9.           There are two program components planned for the Industrial sector. The first, the Motor&#13;
System Program, to be administered by the DSMO, will focus on improving the efficiency of existing&#13;
and new motors systems. The second, the Process Efficiency Program, to be administered by the&#13;
Department of Energy Development and Promotion (DEDP), will focus on the improvement of energy&#13;
efficiency of overall industrial processes. The Motor System Program will provide rebates to purchasers&#13;
of new motors to move to higher efficiency motors and will also provide rebates to motor users to replace&#13;
bumt-out motors with high efficiency motors instead of rewinding. Over time, the Motor Systems&#13;
Program will provide free audits (coordinated with the DEDP) and incentives to encourage replacement.&#13;
In addition, various administrative mechanisms will be implemented, such as the establishment of codes&#13;
of practice and certification of motor rewinders and the reduction of tariffs on the importation of high&#13;
efficiency motors and inverters.&#13;

B. Electricity Generating Company (EGCO)&#13;
1.          EGCO is a private company set up under the commercial code, and registered with the Ministry&#13;
of Commnerce on May 15, 1992 with an initial registered capital of Baht 100 million divided into 10 million&#13;
shares. At the moment, EGAT holds the entire equity with the exception of 15 shares to comply with SET&#13;
regulations for public listing. After the initial public offering, EGAT shall control 48% of EGCO with the&#13;
remaining shares held by Crown Property Bureau and other equity investors, which would include retail and&#13;
institutional investors. It is intended that EGCO would operate at full arms length from EGAT and would&#13;
have full responsibility for its operations.&#13;
2.          After the establishment of EGCO, the Government, in September 1992, took additional steps to&#13;
ensure the success of the privatization program by initially giving EGCO an option to acquire the Khanom&#13;
power facility that consists of a 674 MW nearly-completed combined cycle station, and two other existing 75&#13;
MW barge-mounted thermal power stations located in Southern Thailand. Secondly, the Government granted&#13;
EGCO the rights to invest in businesses related to the power industry and to bid for other independent power&#13;
projects.&#13;
3.         In February 1994, the Cabinet gave its approval in principle to the key project agreements and&#13;
structure of EGCO. EGCO is to be organized as a holding company; it will not become the direct owner of&#13;
specific power plants, rather, holdings will be set up for the assets of each power plant. EGCO will hold&#13;
99.9% of the shares in newly-set up subsidiaries and any business contracts will be made directly by that&#13;
subsidiary. It is envisaged that the holding company structure will allow EGCO to expand to other future&#13;
projects while at the same time allow each project to be financed individually on a project finance basis.&#13;
Following this decision, the Rayong Electricity Generating Company (REGCO) was established in June 1994&#13;
as EGCO's first wholly-owned subsidiary. In line with the recommendations of the EGCO study, EGCO has&#13;
purchased the Rayong power plant and associated assets, partly in exchange for shares and partly on loan&#13;
account. When the transfer of the Rayong Plant is concluded, EGCO's shares will be offered to private&#13;
investors and as EGCO takes on other projects, further tranches of shares will be sold to the public, with&#13;
EGAT always maintaining 48% ownership of EGCO's equity. In April 1994, the Cabinet gave its assent to&#13;
the transfer price of the sale of the Rayong power plant to EGCO. EGCO has now applied for SET listing,&#13;
has appointed a new managing director and two deputies, and is fully operating from its office in Bangkok.&#13;
4.          EGCO is currently negotiating three key project agreements which will define its contractual&#13;
relationships with EGAT as well as the conduct of its future operations. First, it has signed an Asset Purchase&#13;
Agreement, which outlines the assets and the price at which EGAT has agreed to sell them, and includes&#13;
terms of the transfer of title of the Rayong power plant to REGCO and the option for EGCO to purchase the&#13;
Khanom power station. Second, it is finalizing a Power Purchase Agreement, which is the most important of&#13;
the three key agreements since it defines the revenue stream that REGCO is to receive from EGAT in the next&#13;
20 years, and since the Agreement will be used by EGAT as a model for future IPP projects. The main&#13;
features of this Agreement include: (a) EGAT's commitment to take all of the output from the power plants;&#13;
(b) the initial 20 year term with options to extend subject to mutual agreement; (c) the electricity sales price&#13;
comprising of a demand and energy charge; (d) a bonus and penalty scheme providing incentives for high&#13;
levels of power station availability and efficient usage of fuel; (e) interim fuel supply arrangements; and (f)&#13;
governmental force majeure events.  Finally, it is negotiating the terms of a six-year renewable Major&#13;
Maintenance Agreement wherein EGAT has agreed to perform major maintenance, repairs, administrative and&#13;
additional services in exchange for service fees.&#13;

Rationalization of Bulk Supply Tariff to MEA and PEA&#13;
Consulting Study - Terms of Reference&#13;
Background&#13;
1.         Electricity supply in Thailand is undertaken by three utilities: (a) the Electricity Generating&#13;
Authority of Thailand (EGAT) which is responsible for generation and transmission of electricity in the&#13;
whole country and distribution to a few large consumers; (b) the Metropolitan Electricity Authority&#13;
(MEA) which is responsible for distribution of power to metropolitan Bangkok area, Nonthaburi and&#13;
Samut Prakan; and (c) the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) which is responsible for the&#13;
distribution of electricity to the rest of the country.&#13;
2.         MEA and PEA receive power from EGAT in bulk at several of their grid substations.&#13;
The bulk supply tariff to MEA and PEA as currently applied comprises a flat energy charge. Without&#13;
a demand charge or a variation depending on time of use, the tariff does not reflect the costs of supply,&#13;
and is, therefore inadequate to give correct signals to the distribution utilities to improve their load&#13;
factor, load shape and power factor or foster energy conservation. The bulk supply tariffs to MEA and&#13;
PEA are set by the Government, taking into account the financial needs of the three utilities. The&#13;
current tariff for bulk supply to MEA is 1.47 Baht/kwh, whereas the tariff to PEA is 0.96 Baht/kwh,&#13;
although the actual cost of supply to PEA is greater than the cost of supply to MEA. The difference in&#13;
the tariff to the two utilities MEA and PEA is intentional, so that the urban consumers subsidize the&#13;
rural consumers, the retail tariff for all consumers in Thailand being uniform.&#13;
3.         The Government of Thailand has drawn up a plan for the commercialization and&#13;
corporatization and eventual privatization of EGAT, MEA and PEA. EGAT may be separated into&#13;
more than one company, each of which would be responsible for transmission and/or generation, while&#13;
MEA and PEA would continue to be responsible for distribution. PEA is expected to be regionalized&#13;
into more than one company while there is a possibility that MEA may be split into more than one&#13;
company. The entire power sector would be business-oriented and so would be the transactions for&#13;
purchase and sale of electricity between the various parties. A grid code has been drafted for the sale&#13;
of power by Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and the newly created Electricity Generating&#13;
Company Limited (EGCO) to the Transmission Company, a role that is currently assumed by EGAT.&#13;
The current bulk supply arrangements between EGAT and MEA/PEA would no longer be appropriate&#13;
and a new arrangement would need to be evolved. If a subsidy needs to be provided for electrifying&#13;
rural consumers, it may have to be provided through a separate transparent mechanism. Likewise, the&#13;
Government would also consider abolishing uniform retail tariffs throughout the country.&#13;

Objectives and Scope of the Study&#13;
4.         The main objectives and scope of the consulting study would be:&#13;
(a)  to review the current and future (under a restructured power sector) financial requirements&#13;
of EGAT, MEA and PEA and propose a rational basis for setting tariffs that would enable&#13;
the three utilities to meet their financial objectives and needs;&#13;
(b)  to review the existing bulk supply tariff and recommend suitable tariffs for bulk supply to&#13;
MEA and PEA that would reflect the actual costs of supply and take into account the&#13;
future structure of the power industry in Thailand;&#13;
(c)  to review the need for a uniform national tariff and suggest a retail tariff structure that&#13;
would be based on economic principles and provide suitably for equity considerations,&#13;
including the necessary transparent subsidy mechanism;&#13;
(d)  to suggest a time frame and transition strategy for the implementation of the new bulk&#13;
supply tariff;&#13;
(e)  to suggest cost-effective and flexible metering arrangements for measuring and integrating&#13;
demand and energy for bulk supply to MEA and PEA considering that PEA may be&#13;
regionalized into more than one company and MEA could possibly be split into more than&#13;
one company; and&#13;
(f)  recommend draft power purchase agreements for bulk supplies.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
5.         A lot of work has already been done with regard to evaluation of long run marginal costs&#13;
of supply at different voltage levels etc. This should be taken into account and updated as necessary.&#13;
Likewise, the consultant would need to refer all available and ongoing studies relating to corporatization&#13;
and privatization. The consultant would need to review in detail the investment programs of EGAT,&#13;
MEA and PEA and their financial objectives and needs in the context of corporatization and&#13;
privatization, in establishing the rationale for setting the bulk supply tariffs.&#13;
6.         In the conduct of the study, the consultant would work closely with the three electric&#13;
utilities and under the guidance of the National Energy Policy Office.&#13;

Lam Takhong Pump Storage Project&#13;
EGAT's Financial Projections- Assumptions&#13;
Revenues&#13;
1.          Power will be generated in accordance with the gross generation pattern, prepared by&#13;
the System Operations Department, which assumes that the Rayong Power Plant (fuelled by natural&#13;
gas) would be operated as a privatized supplier from October 1994.&#13;
2.          The revenue forecast assumes that demand will rise by an average of 8% between&#13;
FY95-2001 in accordance with estimates prepared in FY93 by the Economic Policy Department&#13;
based on "Load Forecast for the Thailand Electric System". Energy sales will grow by 12% in&#13;
FY94, 10% per year in FY95 to FY97 and by 8% per year in FY98 until FY2001. These&#13;
projections are basically extrapolations of recent trends checked against econometric models&#13;
involving assumptions on growth of the gross domestic product.&#13;
3.          The average price of electricity is about Baht 1.20 per KWh sold in 1993. A price&#13;
increase of about 9% would be necessary during the tariff setting period in FY95 (every three&#13;
years) in order to achieve an acceptable level of self financing for FY95-96. Price increases&#13;
averaging about 8% per year between FY97 and FY2001 would be required to keep the self-&#13;
financing ratio at 25%. EGAT's average electricity price annual increases, and self financing&#13;
ratios for FY95 through FY2001 are shown below:&#13;
| FY94 I FY95 I FY96 I FY97 I FY98 I FY99  [ FY00  [  FY01&#13;
Average energy price with   1.23    1.32    1.33    1.54    1.58     1.72     1.87    1.92&#13;
fuel adj. factor (B/kWh)                                               _        _ 0&#13;
Price increase (%)      _           9.6     0 3    16.1              12.1 _ 12.0    3.0&#13;
Self-financing ratio (%)     23      27      25      25      31       25       25      25&#13;
4.          There will be no change in the tariff structure before September 1994. Adjustments&#13;
will however be made to the price charged to EGAT's customers to recoup the cost relating to:&#13;
(a) changes in fuel cost, excluding lignite; (b) VAT; (c) land and property taxes; and (d) power&#13;
purchased from EGCO.&#13;
Fuel Cost&#13;
5.          The fuel mix is based on EGAT's least cost generation plan. All fuel costs, with the&#13;
exception of lignite, are included in the projections at cost estimated at June 1993. These expenses&#13;
are based on fuel prices used in the calculation of the present tariff structure as follows: (a) Heavy&#13;
oil at Baht 3.15 per liter; (b) Light oil at Baht 7.44 per liter; and Gas at Baht 68 per million BTU.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

-86-                                    Annex 17&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
6.          Although the cost of lignite has initially been included in fuel costs at the current&#13;
transfer price of Baht 501.54 per tonne, the projected profit of the lignite sector is eliminated also&#13;
through fuel costs. This effectively reduces the price of lignite to its production cost.&#13;
7.         If the level of demand for the different fuels varies from the projected, such variance&#13;
is likely to be met by a change in the projected level of power generated by heavy oil.&#13;
Operating Costs&#13;
8.          Generation expenses are based on current EGAT experience, with projections for&#13;
future plants based on historical costs for similar plants and escalated with inflation rates of 5 % per&#13;
annum.&#13;
9.          The projected purchased power is based on the generation pattern noted in para. 1.&#13;
Power purchased from EGCO of 7.7 billion KWh (the net generation of the Rayong Power Plant)&#13;
has been included in the projections at an average price of Baht 1. 15 per KWh. Power purchase&#13;
from Lao PDR's EDL is priced at Baht 0.95 KWh and from Malaysia's TNB at Baht 1.53 KWh&#13;
throughout the projected period.&#13;
10.        Transmission expenses are projected on the basis of an econometric model of&#13;
forecasting by relating unit costs and additions in line length and transformer capacity in EGAT's&#13;
expansion program.&#13;
1l.        General and Administrative expenses are based on current levels in the first year of&#13;
projection. Subsequent year's expenses are escalated with the local escalation factor at the rate of&#13;
5% plus an increase in real terms of 3 %.&#13;
12.        Depreciation is based on the straight-line method on revalued fixed assets.  The&#13;
average rate of depreciation is 1.33% for hydropower plants, 4% for other generating facilities,&#13;
2.5% for transmission lines, and 4% for substations.&#13;
Govermuent Remittance&#13;
13.        The rate of remittance to the Government of Thailand is calculated at 30% of EGAT's&#13;
net income (based on revalued depreciation). This is to date the highest tax rate levied by the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and is in line with the requirements needed for EGAT to qualify for a "Good&#13;
State Enterprise" status.&#13;
Capital Investment&#13;
14.        Projected capital expenditures are those estimated to provide the additional plant and&#13;
equipment required to meet the demand forecast, escalated in accordance with the latest projection&#13;
of inflation rates. These expenditures are projected in accordance with the power development&#13;
plan.&#13;

Page 6 of 6&#13;
Sale of Rayong Power Plant&#13;
15.        The assumptions for the privatization of the Rayong Power Plant can be summarized&#13;
as follows: (a) date of privatization of August 1994; (b) EGAT will recover the effect of power&#13;
purchased from Rayong in the automatic price adjustment; (c) profit of Baht 1.5 billion (net of&#13;
EGAT's equity investment of Baht 2.5 billion) from selling Rayong will be booked as non-&#13;
operating income in the income statement; (d) the proceeds from the sale of Rayong will be used&#13;
for other capital investment rather than repayment of loans which financed the plant; and (e) loans&#13;
of the Rayong plant will remain in EGAT's books with interest on the loans capitalized in works&#13;
under construction.&#13;
Equity Contribution&#13;
16.        Equity contributions represent the Government of Thailand's reimbursement for&#13;
import duties on construction equipment and partial payment with respect to the irrigation portion&#13;
of multi-purpose dams.&#13;
Foreign Exchange Losses&#13;
17.        Deferred foreign exchange losses represent the profits and losses from exchange rate&#13;
variations on long-term debt. The projected figures are the amount on EGAT's accounts at the&#13;
end of FY93 less the incremental amounts which are scheduled to be written off over the&#13;
remaining period of EGAT's existing loans. The amounts shown in the income statement and&#13;
balance sheet reflect currency movements against the Baht.&#13;
Borrowings&#13;
18.        Future foreign loans have been assumed at annual interest rates varying from 3% to&#13;
9% with repayment terms of up to 20 years including from three to five years of grace. Future&#13;
local borrowings have been assumed at an annual interest rate of 11 % repayable up to 10 years&#13;
including three years of grace.&#13;
Current Assets&#13;
19.        Accounts receivables are projected to be approximately two months of revenues in&#13;
accordance with a government regulation affecting state enterprises.  Accounts payable are&#13;
projected at the equivalent of two months of total expenses, excluding depreciation expenses and&#13;
foreign exchange loss. On the basis of EGAT's future expansion plans, spare parts, materials and&#13;
supplies are estimated at Baht 1.2 billion and augmented by about 1% of pre-revalued net fixed&#13;
assets. Fuel stock for reserve is fixed at 150 and 35 million liters of heavy and light oil,&#13;
respectively.&#13;

            The Lam Takhong Pump Storage Project
            will: (a) assist the Electricity Generating Authority of
            Thailand (EGAT) in optimizing its investment decisions and
            help meet the system's peak power demand from 2000
            onwards at least cost; (b) strengthen the environmental
            capabilities of EGAT; and (c) assist the Government in
            privatization of the generation, transmission and
            distribution utilities. In addition, the Bank expects,
            during the project's tenure, to continue rendering
            technical advice to the Government in the implementation of
            power sub-sector and environmental reforms.
