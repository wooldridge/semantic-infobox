FOREWORD&#13;
This paper is one in a special series of World Bank Staff&#13;
Working Papers on population change and development. Prepared as&#13;
background papers for the World Development Report 1984, they&#13;
provide more detailed treatment and documentation of the issues&#13;
dealt with in Part II of the Report.    The papers cover a range of&#13;
topics, including the effects of population growth and change on&#13;
economic development, the determinants of fertility and mortality,&#13;
the links between population growth and internal and international&#13;
migration, and the management, financing, and effectiveness of&#13;
family  planning  programs.    They   include  several  country and&#13;
regional studies of fertility change and population policy.&#13;
The background papers draw on a large number of published&#13;
and unpublished studies of individual researchers, on Bank policy&#13;
analysis and research, and on reports of other organizations&#13;
working on population and development programs and issues.       The&#13;
papers   are   the  work   of   individuals   and  the   views   and&#13;
interpretations expressed in them do not necessarily coincide with&#13;
the views and interpretations of the Report itself.&#13;
I hope these detailed studies will supplement the World&#13;
Development Report 1984 in furthering understanding of population&#13;
and development issues among students and practitioners of&#13;
development.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
The infant mortality rate has declined dramatically in&#13;
Peninsular Malaysia since World War II. This study uses&#13;
individual-level retrospective data on infant mortality and its&#13;
correlates (from the Malaysian Family Life Survey) to examine&#13;
possible reasons for this decline. One important factor has been&#13;
the substantial increase in mothers' education. Improvements in&#13;
water and sanitation also played a role; however, the reduction in&#13;
breastfeeding that has taken place in Malaysia has kept the infant&#13;
mortality rate from declining as rapidly as it would have&#13;
otherwise. This paper shows that the detrimental effects of&#13;
reduced breastfeeding have more than offset the beneficial effects&#13;
of improvements in water and sanitation. In a majority of the&#13;
cases, infant mortality decline is not explained by changes in the&#13;
variables considered here, but is due to factors not investigated&#13;
here--most likely, increases in income and improvements in medical&#13;
and health care.&#13;

I. Introduction&#13;
One of the more gratifying phenomena of the twentieth century has been&#13;
the decline of mortality rates in general and of infant mortality in&#13;
particular. Nearly three-quarters of the total increase in longevity in&#13;
recorded history has occurred since 1900 (Preston 1976). Life expectancy at&#13;
birth has doubled since the beginning of this century (Gwatkin 1980).&#13;
Mortality declines have been greatest in developing countries, such as&#13;
Malaysia. Since World War II, many of the countries have recorded gains in&#13;
life expectancy at least three times as large as those achieved in Western&#13;
Europe at a comparable stage in its mortality transition (Gwatkin 1980). As&#13;
Gwatkin notes, "such rapid progress coming at such low initial levels of life&#13;
expectancy was . . . quite without precedent in history" (p. 617). These&#13;
mortality declines are the major reason for the rapid population growth in&#13;
developing countries since World War II.&#13;
Declining infant mortality explains much of the general decline in&#13;
mortality. In most populations, more people die during the first year of life&#13;
than at any other single age. For example, 28 percent of all deaths in&#13;
Peninsular Malaysia in 1957 occurred in the first year of life (Malaysia&#13;
Department of Statistics 1976). 1/ Furthermore, over the period of rapid&#13;
mortality decline in developing countries, infant mortality rates have shown&#13;
the largest absolute declines. In Malaysia, they have declined from about 100&#13;
infant deaths per 1000 live births in the 1940s to about 30 in the 1970s (Fig. 1).&#13;
The sheer value of life aside, reducing infant mortality has high&#13;
priority for developing countries because children are a major resource&#13;
for both poor families and the nation, and because decreases in infant&#13;
mortality usually lead to reductions in fertility. Consequently, Third&#13;

World governments would like to find means of reducing infant mortality&#13;
even more. To do so, they need to know exactly what changes have contributed&#13;
to this decline and what factors, if any, have kept the decline from being&#13;
greater.&#13;
Many hypotheses have been advanced to explain the dramatic declines in&#13;
infant mortality. Like overall mortality, infant mortality is allegedly&#13;
associated with socioeconomic development; programs to control communicable&#13;
diseases; health education; and improvements in nutrition, sanitation, and&#13;
medical ancl health care. However, some factors may have a particular effect&#13;
on infant mortality. These include pre- and post-natal care, child health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
services, infant feeding, and family planning (which can promote proper&#13;
spacing of children and reduce other high-risk births. Despite a pervasive&#13;
sense that these factors do affect infant mortality, to our knowledge there&#13;
have been no assessment of their relative roles in explaining declines. 2/&#13;
In this paper, we attempt to fill that gap in knowledge, using data on&#13;
Malaysia from 1946 to 1975. During this period, Malaysia experienced rapid&#13;
economic growth and profound social and demographic change, including the&#13;
dramatic decline in infant mortality rates shown in Fig. 1. Our data, from&#13;
the Malaysian Family Life Survey, are unique in that they (1) cover this&#13;
period of dramatic change; (2) document not only infant mortality over this&#13;
period, but also many of its key determinants, 3/ and (3) document these&#13;
variables at the micro level, enabling us to study the structure of mortality&#13;
relationships based on variations among individuals (rather than among broader&#13;
aggregates).&#13;
Our empirical work is guided by our prior use of these data to study&#13;
bioLogical and behavioral influences on infant mortality (Butz, DaVanzo, and&#13;
Habicht 1982; DaVanzo, Butz, and Habicht 1983; Butz, Habicht, and DaVanzo&#13;
1984). In the present study, we focus on variables that strongly influenced&#13;
infant mortality in our previous study and changed considerably over the 1946-&#13;
1975 period. These include:&#13;
* Socioeconomic factors&#13;
- mother's education&#13;
o Sanitation and nutrition variables&#13;
- household water and sanitation&#13;
- type and duration of breastfeeding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
* Demographic variables&#13;
- mother's age at the child's birth&#13;
- whether a short interval preceded the birth&#13;
- ethnic composition of births&#13;
We are unable to assess the role of other variables that may have&#13;
contributed to the decline in infant mortality but are not documented&#13;
retrospectively in our data--for example, increases in income and expansion of&#13;
government health programs.&#13;
Most of the variables documented in our data have changed in such a way&#13;
that they would contribute to a decline in infant mortality (for example,&#13;
increases in mothers' education, improvements in household sanitation, and&#13;
reductions in the proportion of short intervals between births). We assess&#13;
the relative contributions of these changes. However, the change in one&#13;
variable that we consider--breastfeeding--would have led to an increase in&#13;
mortality had other changes not taken place. We assess the extent to which&#13;
decreases in breastfeeding have slowed the decline in infant mortality. These&#13;
empirical analyses are presented in Section III, following a description in&#13;
Section II of our data, the variables we examine, and our analytic methods.&#13;
The final section summarizes our findings and discusses their implications.&#13;
II. Data and Methods&#13;
Data&#13;
We use data from the 1976-77 Malaysian Family Life Survey (MFLS) (Butz&#13;
and DaVanzo 1978). This population-based probability-sample survey comprised&#13;
three rounds in the same panel of households, four months apart, beginning in&#13;
August 1976. The sample consists of randomly selected private households that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
each contained at least one ever-married woman 50 years old or younger at the&#13;
initial visit. A total of 1262 households (88 percent of the eligible&#13;
probability sample) completed Round 1 of the survey. These households are&#13;
contained in 52 primary sampling areas in Peninsular Malaysia, of which 49&#13;
were randomly selected; the other three were purposively selected to give&#13;
additional representation to Indian households and households in fishing&#13;
communities.&#13;
The key questionnaire for this analysis is the Round-i Female&#13;
Retrospective Life History questionnaire (MF2), which includes life events as&#13;
early as the 1940s for some respondents. This questionnaire includes a&#13;
complete life history of all of a woman's pregnancies and related events. For&#13;
each pregnancy, the woman was asked the date and type of outcome. The sample&#13;
for this analysis is the 5357 live births that occurred between 1941 and 1975&#13;
to women in the MFLS sample. 4/&#13;
For each of these live births, information was collected on the lengths&#13;
of unsupplemented and supplemented breastfeeding and whether the child died&#13;
and, if so, the date of death. The retrospective data also contain a&#13;
residential history, including characteristics of houses where respondents&#13;
have lived (such as type of water and toilet sanitation, with whom lived).&#13;
Another questionnaire, the household roster, documents the mother's birth&#13;
date, ethnicity, and education level.&#13;
Variables Considered in the Analysis&#13;
With this information we have computed the following variables for each&#13;
live birth to women in our sample. For each, we describe how the variable is&#13;
measured and why it should affect infant mortality.&#13;
O Infant mortality: whether the child died in its first year of life.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
* Mother's education: years of schooling completed. Higher mother's&#13;
education is a well-established correlate of lower infant mortality (see&#13;
review in Cochrane et al. 1980). When its effect on infant mortality is&#13;
independent of income, it probably reflects mother's knowledge of how to care&#13;
for children and her awareness and use of appropriate health care services.&#13;
Since income is not included in our analyses, our education variable will&#13;
undoubtedly also reflect effects of income, which measures a household's&#13;
ability to afford the inputs--a good diet, modern medical care--that&#13;
contribute to good health.&#13;
* Household water and sanitation: whether the house where the family&#13;
lived when the child was born had piped water or toilet sanitation. These&#13;
presumably measure exposure to gastrointestinal disease through contaminated&#13;
water and to other diseases through lack of personal hygiene.&#13;
*  Breostfeeding:   number of months of unsupplemented and supplemented&#13;
breastfeeding in the first twelve months of life. 5/ Duration of&#13;
breastfeeding may measure nutritional intake and protection against certain&#13;
diseases through maternal antibodies. Extent of supplementation or&#13;
substitution reflects the likelihood of ingestion of pathogens with breastmilk&#13;
supplements or substitutes.&#13;
* Interactions of breastfeeding durations and water and sanitation&#13;
variables. Breastfeeding, especially if unsupplemented, reduces exposure to&#13;
contaminated water. Hence, the detrimental effects of inadequate water and&#13;
sanitation should be less the longer breastfeeding lasts. Similarly,&#13;
breastfeeding should have less of a beneficial effect on survival if hygienic&#13;
water supplies are available. (See Butz, Habicht and DaVanzo, 1984; and Butz,&#13;
DaVanzo, and Habicht, forthcoming.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
* Mother's age at child's birth: entered as a spline (piecewise linear)&#13;
to allow very young (age &lt;18) mothers to exhibit different mortality risks&#13;
from those of mothers in more prime childbearing years. 6/ Young maternal age&#13;
is a well-known correlate of higher infant mortality (United Nations 1973;&#13;
Northman 1974; Puffer and Serano 1975).&#13;
e Length of preceding birth interval: whether the interval preceding this&#13;
child's birth was short (&lt;15 mos.) 7/ This variable is associated with infant&#13;
mortality directly and also indirectly through its effect on birthweight&#13;
(DaVanzo, Butz, and Habicht, 1983; DaVanzo, Habicht, and Butz, 1984).&#13;
* Mother's ethnicity: Chinese, Indian, or Malay (the omitted group).&#13;
Infant mortality rates in Malaysia show consistent ethnic variation (Malaysian&#13;
Department of Statistics, various years), even when other mortality&#13;
determinants that are correlated with ethnicity are controlled (DaVanzo, Butz,&#13;
and Habicht, 1983). 8/&#13;
Quality of the MLFS Data on Infant Mortality&#13;
We have investigated the quality of the MFLS retrospectively reported&#13;
data on infant mortality and associated life events (Haaga 1983) and find that&#13;
the secular trend in infant mortality in the MLFS data and the mortality&#13;
differences between Malays and Chinese are generally similar to those&#13;
indicated by Malaysian vital statistics. 9/ Figure 2, for example, compares&#13;
trends in infant mortality rates calculated from the MFLS and Malaysian Vital&#13;
Statistics. These comparisons show no evidence for decreased reporting of&#13;
mortality events in the distant past. 10/ The good quality of these&#13;
retrospective mortality data probably stems, in part, from their having been&#13;
collected as part of an entire life history of salient events in which&#13;
respondents and interviewers used the occurrence of one type of event to&#13;
promote memory of the occurrences of others. Furthermore, the dates of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
probably the most salient of those events--birth dates of children--were&#13;
verified with documents (birth certificates and identity cards) in most cases.&#13;

Mothers' Ages and Children's Years of Birth&#13;
The MFLS is essentially a random sample of women in their child-&#13;
bearing years at the time of the survey in 1976, and hence should provide a&#13;
random sample of births around that time. It will not, however, provide a&#13;
random sample of births in earlier years. Because there was upper age limit&#13;
(age 50 in 1976) in selecting women for the MFLS sample, the retrospective&#13;
survey will not document the experiences of older women in earlier years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
This is illustrated in Appendix Table A.l, which shows the mother's ages that&#13;
are covered in each calendar year covered by the data. For example, in 1960&#13;
the oldest women in the sample were age 34 and in 1950 they were age 24. 11/&#13;
Trends in Age-specific Infant Mortality&#13;
Rates in the MFLS Data&#13;
Table 1 shows infant mortality rates by mother's age and child's year&#13;
of birth for each age/year cell covered by the MFLS. 12/      The columns of the&#13;
table show the relationship between mother's age and the child's probability&#13;
of dying in the first year of life, holding constant the year of birth.&#13;
Infants born to very young and very old mothers face a higher risk of infant&#13;
mortality, as is widely recognized in the literature (e.g., United Nations&#13;
1973; Nortman 1974; Puffer and Serrano 1975). For years before 1966, the MFLS&#13;
does not contain any women who were in the high-risk ages of 40 or older.&#13;
This may be why the MFLS mortality rates shown in Fig. 2 for the early 1960s&#13;
were below those from the Vital Statistics. However, the MFLS sample of&#13;
births in earlier years, say, before 1955, is disproportionately composed of&#13;
women in the young high-risk ages (&lt;19). This may explain why Fig. 2 shows&#13;
MFLS infant mortality rates for those years that exceed those reported in the&#13;
Vital Statistics.&#13;
Within age groups, the infant mortality rates in Table I have&#13;
generally decreased over time, with the most rapid decline generally occurring&#13;
between the 1956-60 and 1961-65 periods. Since 1960 the declines have been&#13;
more modest and are erratic for women under age 25 and over age 34. This may&#13;
reflect a changing selectivity of the kinds of women who give birth at these&#13;
higher-risk ages, since fertility rates have decreased the most at the extreme&#13;
ages of childbearing (Hirschman and Fernandez 1980, Table 4).&#13;

Methods&#13;
Overview&#13;
The goal in this paper is to see how well we can explain the infant&#13;
mortality decline that has occurred in Malaysia since World War II. To do&#13;
this we use retrospective information on a number of socioeconomic,&#13;
demographic, sanitation, and nutritional variables that are related to&#13;
variations in mortality and are alleged to be factors contributing to&#13;
improvements in child survival. We estimate the relationship between infant&#13;
mortality and those explanatory variables available in the Malaysian Family&#13;
Life Survey (MFLS) that both affect infant mortality and have shown sufficient&#13;
variation over time that they could affect the mortality trend. For example,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
we do not include the infant's sex in our analysis because this well-known&#13;
correlate of mortality differentials exhibits very little systematic variation&#13;
over time. We also do not consider some proximate determinants, such as&#13;
birthweight, that affect infant survival, since they largely mediate the&#13;
effects of other variables such as short birth spacing that are included in&#13;
the analysis. Another variable we exclude is the calendar year of the child's&#13;
birth. This variable is highly correlated with variables that have varied&#13;
systematically over time and might have robbed them of some of their&#13;
explanatory power had we included it. 13/ We have already discussed above the&#13;
variables we consider, their definitions, and the reasons for their inclusion.&#13;
After estimating the relationship of these variables to infant&#13;
mortality, we see how well the change in these variables can explain the&#13;
mortality decline that actually occurred. We assess the relative role of&#13;
changes in each explanatory variable. We also assess whether the structure of&#13;
the relationship between infant mortality and its determinants has changed&#13;
over time and assess the importance of these structural changes in explaining&#13;
the mortality decline.&#13;
Fixed Structure&#13;
We first assess the contributions of changes in explanatory variables&#13;
assuming a fixed structure of coefficients. For this analysis, reported in&#13;
Table 2, we restrict our sample to births in the years 1956-75 to women under&#13;
age 30. We restrict the sample in this way in order to hold constant the age&#13;
range of the sample in each year (see Appendix Table A 3). 14/ This age range&#13;
will represent the majority of births in any year, given the age pattern of&#13;
childbearing in Malaysia (see sample sizes in Appendix Table A.2).&#13;

Table 2 presents two sets of regressions for this sample. The first&#13;
is estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS). This linear probability model&#13;
permits a simple decomposition of the change in the infant mortality rate and&#13;
describes attributable risks, the absolute increment in mortality due to the&#13;
change in a particular factor. The second set is estimated by logit, which is&#13;
the appropriate technique if variables affect the relative odds of dying&#13;
rather than the absolute mortality differential. For the logit model, we&#13;
assess the roles of changes in explanatory variables in explaining the changes&#13;
in the probability of infant mortality that are implied by the logit&#13;
coefficients evaluated at the sample mean probability. 15/ The implications&#13;
of the OLS and logit analyses are very similar in their statistical signifi-&#13;
cance 16/ and the relative importance of particular variables. 17/&#13;
The OLS coefficients, 3., each show the change in the probability of&#13;
infant mortality due to a one-unit change in a particular variable, Xi.      We&#13;
have multiplied each coefficient by the actual change in that variable that&#13;
occurred between two points in time, i.e., a iXi, to show the actual of&#13;
mortality change due to the actual change in that variable. The sum of all of&#13;
these, E6 iAXi , is the overall change in infant mortality explained by the&#13;
regression.,&#13;
For our two time points we use the five-year periods at the beginning&#13;
and end of our 1956-75 period, i.e., 1956-60 and 1971-75. We have computed&#13;
the means of all variables for the subsamples of births that occurred in each&#13;
of these subperiods.&#13;
We repeat this same exercise for the logit estimates, after&#13;
converting the logit coefficients to probability units. 18/ We also present&#13;
predicted average probabilities for subperiods from the logit estimates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
These are the average of predicted probabilities for each individual,&#13;
calculated as Pi    1/(1 + e logiti).&#13;
Changing Structure&#13;
The analysis described in the previous subsection assumes that the&#13;
structure of relationships explaining mortality variations has not changed&#13;
over time--that changes over time in the explanatory variables are the only&#13;
reasons for mortality decline. However, over a period of dramatic&#13;
socioeconomic, demographic, and public health change, it is possible that the&#13;
structure of the relationships has also changed. Preston (1980) contends that&#13;
about half of the increase in life expectancy in developing countries between&#13;
1940 and 1970 was due to structural change.&#13;
To assess the role of structural change, we allow for different&#13;
regression coefficients for two time periods--1946-60 and 1961-75. By&#13;
extending our time span back to 1946, we cover a longer period than in the&#13;
fixed structure analysis--a period over which there was a larger decrease in&#13;
infant mortality. However, in 1946 the oldest woman in the MFLS sample was&#13;
20. To define our samples comparably for the 1961-75 period, we restrict our&#13;
sample in this later period to women who were age 20 or less in 1961. We then&#13;
follow these two cohorts of women--those aged 20 or less in 1946 and those 20&#13;
or less in 1961--over the next 15 years of their lives. Appendix Table A.4&#13;
shows the ranges of mothers' ages represented in these two samples.&#13;
We have pooled these two samples and have estimated both OLS and&#13;
logit regressions that allow for different coefficients for the two periods.&#13;
(We do this by interacting each variable with a 1961-75 dummy.) We test&#13;
whether the 1946-60 and 1961-75 coefficients differ for each variable and find&#13;
that the OLS and logit estimates often yield different conclusions about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
whether the effect of a particular variable differs significantly between the&#13;
1946-60 and 1961-75 periods. 19/&#13;
We then use the earlier-period structure and the later-period&#13;
variable values to see how well the earlier structure would predict the&#13;
mortality decline that actually occurred. We also repeat this exercise&#13;
"backwards," multiplying the later-period coefficients by the earlier-period&#13;
variable values to see if the more recent structure can explain mortality in&#13;
the past. The difference between the actual infant mortality rate in a&#13;
subperiod and that predicted by that period's values of variables and the&#13;
other periodl's structure is the portion attributable to structural change. 20/&#13;
III. Empirical Analysis&#13;
Fixed Structure&#13;
Table 2 presents the results of our analysis that estimate the roles&#13;
of various variables in explaining infant mortality decline over the 1956-75&#13;
period assuming a fixed structure of coefficients.&#13;
The first two columns show the actual changes in variables that took&#13;
place between the beginning (1956-60) and end (1971-75) of this period.&#13;
Between these two subperiods the infant mortality rate of babies born to women&#13;
younger than age 30 decreased by over half--from 60.6 to 29.9. Over this same&#13;
period mothers' education increased; piped water and toilet sanitation became&#13;
more prevalent; fewer births followed a short interval or were to very young&#13;
women; and relatively more births occurred to Chinese women. Each of these&#13;
changes could potentially contribute to a decline in infant mortality, since&#13;
these differentials were associated with lower infant mortality in our&#13;
previous study (DaVanzo, Butz, and Habicht, 1983). However, over this same&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
period, durations of breastfeeding became shorter. This could contribute to&#13;
an increase in infant mortality.&#13;
In column (3) we present OLS regression coefficients showing the&#13;
relationships between infant mortality and these explanatory variables for the&#13;
sample of births to women younger than age thirty over this 1956-75 period.&#13;
All coefficients have the expected signs and nearly all are statistically&#13;
significant. The logit estimates in column (5) give practically identical&#13;
qualitative results. As in our previous studies (Butz, Habicht, and DaVanzo,&#13;
1984; Butz, DaVanzo, and Habicht, forthcoming), we find that the beneficial&#13;
effect of breastfeeding is reduced when modern water and sanitation are&#13;
present and vice versa.&#13;
Columns (4) and (6) put these coefficients and explanatory variable&#13;
changes together to show the amount of infant mortality decline due to the&#13;
change in each explanatory variable. The results are summarized in Table 3.&#13;

All in all, the OLS regression in column (4) explains 9.2 deaths per thousand&#13;
of the 30.6 per thousand decline in the infant mortality rate that actually&#13;
occurred between 1956-60 and 1971.75--less than a third of the actual&#13;
decline. (For 1956-60, the OLS regression predicts an infant mortality rate&#13;
of 45.7 on the basis of the 1956-60 means of explanatory variables, compared&#13;
with the actual rate of 60.6. For 1971-75, the predicted rate of 36.5,&#13;
compared with the actual rate of 20.9.) The logit regression does a little&#13;
better, predicting 12.3 deaths per thousand of the decline.&#13;
The results in both columns (4) and (6) indicate that increases in&#13;
mother's education and in piped water for women who do not breastfeed 21/ have&#13;
been the largest contributors to the part of the infant mortality decline&#13;
between 1956 and 1975 that we are able to explain. Improvements in toilet&#13;
sanitation, increases in mother's age at childbearing, and increases in the&#13;
proportion of births to Chinese women also make modest contributions to the&#13;
decline. On the other hand, decreases in the durations of both unsupplemented&#13;
and supplemented breastfeeding among women who do not have piped water or&#13;
toilet sanitation contributed to increases in mortality over this period. The&#13;
conditional nature of these estimates, and the fact that the interactions of&#13;
the breastfeeding and water and sanitation variables must also be considered,&#13;
makes it difficult to use Table 2 to assess the actual roles of changes in&#13;
breastfeeding and water and sanitation. However, we can tell by adding all&#13;
relevant terms in column (4) or coLumn (6) together (i.e., adding the second&#13;
through ninth items in column (4) or (6)) that the changes in breastfeeding,&#13;
water, and sanitation together implied an increase of 2.8 deaths per thousand&#13;
in the infant mortality rate based on the OLS estimates and an increase of 2.5&#13;
deaths per thousand based on the logit estimates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
We try to separate the roles of the opposing breastfeeding and water&#13;
sanitation trends in Table 4. In this table we estimate (1) the mortality&#13;
changes due to the breastfeeding decreases, holding constant the level of&#13;
water and sanitation at their overall sample means; 22/ (2) the mortality&#13;
changes due to the water and sanitation improvements, holding constant breast-&#13;
feeding; and (3) the mortality changes due to the interaction of these two&#13;
changes.&#13;
The data in Table 4 imply that, holding water and sanitation constant&#13;
at their overall sample means, the breastfeeding declines that occurred&#13;
between 1956-60 and 1971-75 contributed to a 8.6 per thousand increase in the&#13;
infant mortality rate when the OLS estimates are used and a 6.7 per thousand&#13;
increase based on the logit estimates. In other words, had breastfeeding not&#13;
declined (holding water and sanitation constant), the infant mortality rate&#13;
would have declined another 7 or 8 deaths per thousand births. Over this&#13;
period water and sanitation did improve, but, when we hold the breastfeeding&#13;
variables constant at their 1956-75 mean values, these water and sanitation&#13;
improvements contributed only 2.5 deaths per thousand to the mortality decline&#13;
based on the OLS estimates and even less, 1.7 per thousand, based on the logit&#13;
estimates. These effects are relatively small because water and sanitation&#13;
improvements are not very important when breastfeeding is prevalent and of&#13;
long duration, as it was over much of this period. The interaction effects&#13;
(which have been calculated residually in light of the total effect of all&#13;
changes in breastfeeding, water, and sanitation indicated in columns (4) and&#13;
(6) of Table 2) are negative. This implies that the increases in the&#13;
importance of water and sanitation improvements that occurred because of&#13;
reduced breastfeeding outweighed the increases in the importance of breast-&#13;
feeding declines that occurred because of water and sanitation improvements.&#13;

The results in both Tables 2 and 4 indicate strongly that reductions&#13;
in breastfeeding have put considerable upward pressure on the infant mortality&#13;
rate and have prevented it from falling as rapidly as it would have&#13;
otherwise. The declines in breastfeeding have more than offset the beneficial&#13;
influences of improvemencs in water and sanitation.&#13;
Though some of the factors considered in Table 2 appear to have&#13;
accounted for some of the mortality decline that occurred, and others are&#13;
estimated to have prevented mortality from declining even further, we are not&#13;
able to explain the majority of the actual decline. 23/ This is shown both in&#13;
Table 3, which compares the predicted infant mortality rates for the 1956-60&#13;
and 1971-75 periods with the actual rates, and in a regression of the OLS&#13;
residuals (actual less predicted mortality rates) against year of child's&#13;
birth:&#13;
Residual = .0859 - .00131 Year.&#13;
(2.19) (-2.20)&#13;
That is, the unexplained variation in infant mortality rates is systematically&#13;
related to the year of the child's birth. 24/ These results imply that some&#13;
factors unaccounted for in this analysis, that have varied systematically over&#13;
time but are not highly correlated with the variables considered here, appear&#13;
to be the primary reasons for the infant mortality declines that have occurred&#13;
in Malaysia. In the next subsection we assess the role of changes over time&#13;
in the structure of the relationships between infant mortality and its&#13;
determinants in explaining the mortality decline. The final section&#13;
speculates about what some of the important unmeasured factors might be.&#13;

Allowin for Structural Change&#13;
Which Coefficients Have Changed Over Time?&#13;
Columns (1), (2), (4), and (5) of Table 5 present OLS and logit&#13;
regressions that allow coefficients to differ between the 1946-60 and 1961-75&#13;
periods. Columns (3) and (6) present t-statistics indicating whether the&#13;
coefficient of each variable differs significantly between the two periods.&#13;
At the end of the table we present similar information for the total effects&#13;
of breastfeeding, water, and sanitation. As discussed in Sec. II, the sample&#13;
for each period consists of births to the cohort of women age 20 or less at&#13;
the beginning of the period (i.e., age 34 or less at its end). 25/&#13;
The equation specification for Table 5 is the same as in Table 2&#13;
except that we have excluded the mothers' age variables. We do this for&#13;
several reasons: (1) Because the samples here are cohorts of women, age is&#13;
systematically related to calendar year within each of the samples and could&#13;
absorb effects of "time"; (2) there are too few women who gave birth before&#13;
age 18 in the sample of births after 1960 to fit this part of the age spline&#13;
reliably; 26/ and (3) age effects are not large in Table 2.&#13;
About half the coefficients differ significantly at the 10 percent&#13;
level between the two periods in either the OLS regression or in both the OLS&#13;
and logit regressions (two-tailed test, i.e., itl &gt; 1.64). Where differences&#13;
arise, it is usually the case that effects are stronger before 1960 than&#13;
afterwards. For toilet sanitation (for those who do not breastfeed), this is&#13;
true in both the OLS and logit estimates, indicating a fall not only in the&#13;
attributable risk (additional deaths) but in the relative risk as well. 27/&#13;
This variable is much more strongly associated with lower infant mortality&#13;
before 1960 than afterwards. In fact, the logit estimate is not significant&#13;

for births after 1960. This is true also for the total effects of toilet&#13;
sanitation shown at the end of Table 5. An inappropriate sanitation system&#13;
appears to carry less risk when overall public health conditions improve (as&#13;
they did in Malaysia between the two periods considered here).&#13;
The intercept also differs significantly between the two periods in&#13;
both the OLS and logit analysis, indicating that when all explanatory&#13;
variables are set to zero (which is a possible value for all variables&#13;
considered here), the mortality risk is significantly lower in the later&#13;
period. 28/&#13;
Mothers' education is the only variable (other than the Full&#13;
Breastfeeding x Water interaction) whose influence is substantially stronger&#13;
after 1960 than before, and the difference between the periods is nearly&#13;
significant in the logit estimates. The number of lives saved due to an&#13;
additional year of education does not differ significantly between the 1946-60&#13;
and 1961-75 periods in the OLS estimates. Since a year of education is&#13;
associated with as many lives saved when the mean infant mortality rate&#13;
exceeded 70 (before 1960) as when it was less than half that value (after&#13;
1960), the reduction in relative risk due to an additional year of education&#13;
is much greater in the later period. Indeed, the logit estimates in Table 5&#13;
indicates a significant negative effect of education in the later period, but&#13;
no significant effect in the earlier period. A similar pattern arises in&#13;
comparing infant and child mortality determinants in high- and low-mortality&#13;
regions of Malaysia: Mother's education is somewhat more important in&#13;
explaining mortality differentials in the low-mortality areas (Khairuddin et&#13;
al., forthcoming). These results together suggest that mother's education has&#13;
been complementary with economic development in reducing infant mortality in&#13;
Malaysia since World War II. 29/ It may be that certain miniminal levels of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
the means to reduce mortality (scientific information about health care and&#13;
diet, availability of health care and diet, availabilty of health care) may be&#13;
necessary for mother's education to have a significant beneficial effect. It&#13;
is also posible that more education helps mothers make more appropriate&#13;
weaning decisions, and hence becomes a more important influence on infant&#13;
mortality when breastfeeding becomes less prevalent and of shorter duration. 30/&#13;
The remaining variables in the regression sometimes differ signifi-&#13;
cantly between the two periods in their effect in terms of lives saved, i e.,&#13;
in the OLS estimates. 31/ However, none of these variables differ signi-&#13;
ficantly between the 1946-60 and 1961-75 periods in their influence on the&#13;
relative odds of mortality, i.e., in the logit estimates. By and large, the&#13;
relationships of these variables with infant mortality are the same as we saw&#13;
earlier in Table 2.&#13;
The logit model seems the more appropriate one here in light of the&#13;
considerabLe decrease in the average infant mortality risk between the 1946-60&#13;
and 1961-75 periods. Indeed, the greater stability of the coefficients&#13;
between th,e two time periods reinforces this belief. Many of the significant&#13;
differences found between periods in the OLS estimates appear to be mainly due&#13;
to the declining average risk. In the logit model the only significant&#13;
structural differences between the 1946-60 and 1961-75 periods arise for the&#13;
intercept and toilet sanitation (for babies who are not breastfed).&#13;
How Well Does the 1946-60 Structure Predict the&#13;
1961-75 Infant Mortality Rate (and Vice Versa)?&#13;
We have just seen that several coefficients differ significantly in&#13;
their effect on infant mortality between the 1946-60 and 1961-75 periods. In&#13;
Table 6 we assess the relative importance of these structural changes vs.&#13;
changes in variables in explaining the mortality decline that occurred between&#13;
these two periods. We do this by seeing how well the 1946-60 structure and&#13;

the 1961-75 values of explanatory variables predict the 1961-75 infant&#13;
mortality rate. The difference between this predicted 1961-75 mortality rate&#13;
and the actual 1946-60 rate is the portion of mortality decline attributable&#13;
to changes in variables. The difference between this predicted 1961-75&#13;
mortality rate and the actual 1961-75 rate is the portion due to structural&#13;
change. We also repeat this exercise "backwards," seeing how well the later&#13;
structure would have predicted the mortality rate in the earlier period, given&#13;
the values of the explanatory variables then.&#13;
Changes in the values of variables explain relatively little of the&#13;
mortality decline. The 1946-60 coefficients, when applied to the 1961-75&#13;
values of explanatory variables, imply that the infant mortality rate would&#13;
decrease from 72.3 in 1946-60 to 64.5 by 1961-75 for the OLS coefficients and&#13;
to 63.4 for the logit coefficients. The actual 1961-75 infant mortality rate&#13;
was 33.3--more than 30 points lower than predicted. A similar conclusion is&#13;
reached if we take the later period coefficients and use the earlier period&#13;
values of variables. Here we would have predicted even less of the actual&#13;
infant mortality change that occurred, because many of the coefficients fell&#13;
between the 1946-60 and 1961-75 periods and hence the later regression is less&#13;
sensitive to changes in variables. In both cases, the logit coefficients&#13;
predict somewhat better than the OLS, a further indication that the logit&#13;
model is the more appropriate of the two, though the OLS and logit predictions&#13;
are remarkably similar. Nonetheless, the logit coefficients explain at most&#13;
only 8.9 deaths per thousand of the actual 39 per thousand difference between&#13;
the periods.&#13;
We conclude that the better part of the decline in the infant&#13;
mortality rate that occurred between 1946-60 and 1961-75 is not due to changes&#13;
in the levels of the variables we have considered here, but to changes in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
structure of mortality relationships. Around 80 percent of the decline&#13;
appears due to change in structure, a percentage very similar to that found by&#13;
Preston in a similar exercise (Preston 1976, Ch. 4).&#13;
IV. Summary and Conclusions&#13;
This analysis has identified several factors that have contributed to&#13;
the dramatic decline in infant mortality that has occurred since World War II&#13;
in Malaysia, as well as one factor that has prevented infant mortality rates&#13;
from declining even more rapidly.&#13;
Our main findings are the following:&#13;
(1) On average, mothers' education more than doubled over the study&#13;
period and contributed importantly to the decline in their infants' mortality.&#13;
In addition, the beneficial effect of mothers' educaLion appears to have&#13;
become stronger over the study period. Hence, further advances in education&#13;
should lead to further improvements in infants' survival prospects. In another&#13;
analysis of these data (Khairuddin et al., forthcoming), we also found that&#13;
education is somewhat more influential in that regard in low-mortality, high-&#13;
income areas than in the opposite type of areas. It therefore appears that&#13;
economic development may complement, instead of substitute for, the beneficial&#13;
effect of mothers' education in promoting infant survival in Malaysia.&#13;
(2) Improvements in water and sanitation also contributed to the infant&#13;
mortality decline, especially for babies who were not breastfed. However,&#13;
unlike education, these influences have become less important over time,&#13;
especially for babies who are not breastfed. Hence further improvements in&#13;
water and sanitation, a goal of Malaysia's Rural Environmental Sanitation&#13;
Programme, can be expected to have smaller relative effects on infant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
mortality than did previous improvements. Targetting such improvements on&#13;
areas where women breastfeed little or not at all, however, will increase&#13;
their effectiveness in promoting infant survival.&#13;
(3) The substantial reductions in breastfeeding that have taken place&#13;
since World War II have kept the infant mortality rate in Malaysia from&#13;
declining as rapidly as it would have otherwise. In fact, we estimate that,&#13;
in our sampLe, the detrimental effects on infant survival of the decline in&#13;
breastfeeding have more than offset the beneficial effects of improvements in&#13;
water and sanitation.&#13;
(4) Unlike some recent studies (e.g., Palloni 1981), we find that changes&#13;
in fertility levels and in the timing and spacing of births have had&#13;
negligible effect in explaining the decline in infant mortality within the&#13;
samples we have considered. We have excluded births to older women from our&#13;
analysis, however, and this may have led to an understatement of the influence&#13;
of changes in the age pattern of childbearing.&#13;
(5) Despite the contributions of the variables just discussed, we are&#13;
unable to explain much of the actual decline in the infant mortality rate by&#13;
changes in the variables considered here. Our finding, based on micro data on&#13;
individual births, is similar to Preston's findings based on country aggre&#13;
gates (1976, 1980) that structural change explains as much or more of mortality&#13;
decline as do changes in a set of socioeconomic and other variables. 32/&#13;
Although we conclude that structural change explains the greater part&#13;
of the infant mortality decline that occurred, most influences on infant&#13;
mortality have not changed significantly over time. When a relative risk&#13;
(logit) model is used, the coefficients of only two variables differ&#13;
significantly between the periods before and after 1960: the intercept and&#13;
the coefficient of toilet sanitation (for babies who were not breastfed).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Toilet sanitation had significantly less beneficial influence on infant&#13;
survival for babies born after 1960 than before. Hence, this structural&#13;
change has not contributed to the mortality decline. Instead, the explanation&#13;
for the majority of the mortality decline lies in the influence of factors not&#13;
considered in this analysis--i.e., in the intercept term. When all variables&#13;
considered here are held constant, the risk of dying in infancy is much lower&#13;
after 1960 than before. 33/&#13;
What might these other factors be? Although we hesitate to put a&#13;
label on what we are unable to explain, several possibilities seem likely.&#13;
One is income growth. Higher incomes enable families to afford better medical&#13;
care and better nutrition (which reduces the fatality rate from most&#13;
diseases). Wage incomes (adjusted for cost of living) increased at an average&#13;
annual rate of 2.4 percent per year in Malaysia over the period considered&#13;
here (Smith 1983). Since an important share of this income growth was due to&#13;
increases in education (Smith 1983), however, it is likely that our education&#13;
variable has already absorbed some of this effect.&#13;
Improvements in medical and health care may also have contributed to&#13;
the mortality decline. Since independence in 1957, the Malaysian government&#13;
has spent increasing amounts of money on programs to combat the major endemic&#13;
communicable diseases prevalent in the country, 34/ to extend health services&#13;
to the rural areas, and to provide preventive medical services. Maternal-&#13;
child health care is one of the largest components of the rural health&#13;
program. A recent report by the Malaysian government contends that "the rapid&#13;
fall in child mortality was a direct consequence of these services provided by&#13;
the Rural Health Programme" (Abu Bakar 1981, p. 257). Many of these programs&#13;
were begun after 1960 and may well have contributed to the large reduction in&#13;
the infant mortality rate we find between the 1946-60 and 1961-75 periods. 35/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
In conclusion, the greater part of the infant mortality decline in&#13;
Malaysia is not explained by the factors considered in this analysis. Of the&#13;
portion that is explained here, increases in mothers' education and&#13;
improvements in water and sanitation appear to be the most important factors.&#13;

1/   By 1974 the figure had fallen to 17 percent--still very large in relation&#13;
to the 1974 life expectancy at birth of 64 years for males and 69 years for&#13;
females.&#13;
2/   Preston (1980) has provided such an assessment for overall mortality&#13;
Tlife expectancy) in developing countries, using countries as his units of&#13;
analysis. Also see Palloni (1981), Gwatkin (1980), McKeown and Record (1962),&#13;
and references therein.&#13;
3/   This contrasts, for example, with the World Fertility Surveys, which also&#13;
documents trends in infant mortality over a similar period, but which lack&#13;
corresponding historical information on most of its determinants.&#13;
4/   The analysis excludes births that occurred less than a year before the&#13;
date of interview.&#13;
5/   If a baby dies soon after birth or for reasons unrelated to feeding,&#13;
breastfeeding will be short because the baby died or was ill-unto-death. Such&#13;
a reverse-causation bias can result in serious overestimates of the apparent&#13;
effect of breastfeeding in reducing infant mortality (Habicht, DaVanzo, and&#13;
Butz, 1984). We have tried to correct for this potential bias here by&#13;
imputing the length of breastfeeding to all infants whose mothers said that&#13;
the reason they did not breastfeed or breastfed less than three months was&#13;
because the baby died or was ill. We also impute breastfeeding durations to&#13;
babies who stopped breastfeeding within the last 12.5 percent of their life&#13;
span. Such cases were more frequent among children who died than would be&#13;
expected, given the distribution of breastfeeding durations, and we infer that&#13;
these infants who nursed until shortly before death are more likely both to&#13;
have ceased nursing and to have died because of third causes (illness) than to&#13;
have died because they ceased nursing.&#13;
For all these babies who stopped nursing because they died or were about&#13;
to die, we imputed the durations of unsupplemented and supplemented&#13;
breastfeeding they most likely would have received had they survived. We&#13;
imputed these durations of breastfeeding conditional on the infant's age and&#13;
type of breastfeeding at cessation of breastfeeding, based on the experiences&#13;
of other babies who had the same type of breastfeeding at that age but whose&#13;
breastfeeding was not curtailed by death or illness-unto-death. For infants&#13;
who lived less than one week and did not initiate breastfeeding, we assign the&#13;
unconditional means of unsupplemented and supplemented breastfeeding of all&#13;
infants in the sample while breastfeeding was not interrupted by death or&#13;
illness-unto-death. For more detail on these procedures, see Habicht,&#13;
DaVanzo, and Butz (1984).&#13;
6/   We do not allow for an effect of older maternal age because, as described&#13;
below, or analyses exclude observations on births to older women.&#13;
7/   This variable is defined only for birth orders of two or higher.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
8/   Although all the variables in this list have been shown to have&#13;
statistically significant relationships with variations in infant mortality,&#13;
they do not directly measure actual causes of death and are usually only&#13;
imperfect measures of their proximate determinants. For example, our&#13;
sanitation variable indicates whether the household had any type of toilet at&#13;
the time of the child's birth but not the specific type of toilet. Such&#13;
"errors in variables" will lead to underestimates of the importance of any&#13;
factor that is measured with error.&#13;
InitiaLly, all of the variables included in our earlier analysis&#13;
(DaVanzo, Butz, and Habicht, 1983) were considered for this analysis. Some of&#13;
these variables are not included here because they did not relate significantly&#13;
to variations in infant mortality in the samples used here, did not exhibit&#13;
consistent variation over time, or were judged to mainly mediate the effects&#13;
of variables that are considered here. These excluded variables include&#13;
household income, the infant's birth order (with first birth order and high&#13;
birth order treated separately); the presence of grandparents, other&#13;
relatives, and other young children in the household; whether the baby was&#13;
born in a hospital; degree of rurality of the area where the parents lived&#13;
when the baby was born; household crowding; and the baby's sex and&#13;
birthweight. In a related study (Khairuddin et al., forthcoming) we show that&#13;
region of the country is not a significant correlate of infant mortality when&#13;
the variables considered here are controlled.&#13;
The income variables used in our previous study was constructed from&#13;
retrospective reports of hours worked and wages of the mother and her husband&#13;
and of his other income. It is adjusted by complex imputation procedures,&#13;
which were based on the more detailed data on families' income and wealth at&#13;
the time oE the study and on retrospective information on income correlates&#13;
(e.g., occupation, employment status, type of area of residence). The&#13;
resulting income variable was probably liable to greater error than any other&#13;
variable in that study and it was never significantly related to infant&#13;
mortality there.    For the present study we further adjusted that variable so&#13;
it would reflect the real economic growth that took place in Malaysia over the&#13;
period considered here. (These procedures are described in notes available&#13;
from the authors, on request.) The coefficients of this adjusted variable,&#13;
however, were often positive and were significant for the 1961-75 period. It&#13;
is undoubtedly true that infant mortality differentials by income in Malaysia&#13;
have narrcwed over time, especially given the Malaysian government's efforts&#13;
to equalize the distribution of health services across the country by&#13;
extending services into poorer, rural areas. However, we find it hard to&#13;
believe that, other things the same, a baby born into a well-to-do family is&#13;
significantly more likely to die than one born into a very poor family.&#13;
Furthermore, the estimate of a positive income effect gave us some very&#13;
peculiar results when we attempted to account for reasons for mortality&#13;
decline and to use the coefficients for one period to predict the infant&#13;
mortality rate in the other period. Given the well-known problems in&#13;
constructing an appropriate measure of income, even when good information is&#13;
available on its components (e g., see Kusnic and DaVanzo 1980), we decided&#13;
that we could not measure income retrospectively with sufficient reliability&#13;
to include it in the analysis. Since education is highly correlated with&#13;
income, especially in explaining income growth in Malaysia (Smith 1983), our&#13;
education variable should reflect income changes to some extent. The water&#13;
and sanitation variables also are positively correlated with income and should&#13;
reflect its influence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

9/   The MFLS infant mortality rate for Indians is higher than that indicated&#13;
by vital statistics for the entire population of Malaysian Indians. The MFLS&#13;
Indian sample is relatively small.&#13;
10/ See ahead for the probable reason why the MFLS infant mortality rates are&#13;
higher than the vital statistics rates before 1955.&#13;
11/ The MFLS survey design could lead to two other possible biases: (1) The&#13;
MFLS sample will not be a random sample of all women in the birth cohorts that&#13;
are represented because some women in these cohorts will have died or&#13;
emigrated before the date of the survey and their fertility and infant&#13;
mortality experiences will not be recorded. In Peninsular Malaysia, however,&#13;
mortality rates during childbearing years have been low enough for the cohorts&#13;
studied here (Khairuddin 1974) that this bias should not significantly affect&#13;
the results reported here. (2) Since the MFLS sample is restricted to ever-&#13;
married women, the experiences of those who have never been married will not&#13;
be represented. This should result in negligible bias since out-of-wedlock&#13;
childbearing is very rare in Malaysia.&#13;
12/ These rates are truly age-specific rates. For example, the rate for&#13;
1961-65 for women aged 20-24 refers to those aged 20-24 in each of these&#13;
years. It does not refer to the cohort of women aged 20-24 at the&#13;
beginning or end of that time period. See Appendix Table A.2.&#13;
13/ Of course, calendar year may be proxying real changes that have occurred,&#13;
for example, public health improvements. To assess its residual role, we&#13;
regress residuals (actual less predicted infant mortality) from our infant&#13;
mortality regression against calendar year. We have also run the infant&#13;
mortality regressions including calendar year and discuss, but do not present,&#13;
those results.&#13;
14/ Had we included years before 1956, our sample for those years would have&#13;
systematically excluded the older members of this age group (See Table A.3).&#13;
15/   aPaX. =    .P(l-P).&#13;
-           1    1&#13;
16/ As expected from Haggstrom (1983).&#13;
17/ Neither analysis allows for intrahousehold correlation of errors. Since&#13;
the observations are live births there is frequently more than one observation&#13;
per mother. This creates the possibility that influences on different infants&#13;
born to the same mother may be correlated. We partially control for this by&#13;
including variables specific to the infant and variables specific to the&#13;
mother or household. However, unmeasured mother-specific influences may&#13;
remain. The resulting coefficient estimates reported below are unbiased on&#13;
this account, but the reported standard errors may be smaller than is actually&#13;
the case. Hence, the true precision of estimates may be less than is reported&#13;
here. This is probably more true for family variables (for example, stable&#13;
maternal characteristics like schooling level) than for child characteristics,&#13;
since the former are likely to be more highly correlated across infants in the&#13;
same family.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
18/  The sumT  Z.AIX. for the ligit estimates shows the change in the average&#13;
I 1&#13;
logit, but is not directly transformable into probability units because of the&#13;
nonlinearity of the logit transformation.&#13;
19/ An alternative approach would have been to interact all explanatory&#13;
variables with a linear variable measuring child's year of birth, using a&#13;
sample like that used in the fixed-structure analysis. The approach we use&#13;
has the advantage of enabling us to extend the years covered by the analysis&#13;
back to 1940.&#13;
20/ For example, in a linear model estimated for two subperiods, j and k,&#13;
IR=    = XBitX.t,   t   j or k, where i indexes variables.&#13;
t&#13;
Hence IMR. - (TMRk I BkX.)    =           -Z.ij-ij -   ikxij  = (Bij --Bik  ij.&#13;
21/ The coefficient of piped water alone shows its effect when both&#13;
breastfeeding variables equal zero. For positive values of breastfeeding, the&#13;
Water x Breastfeeding interactions must also be considered. This is&#13;
considered in more detail in Table 4.&#13;
22/ For example, for the OLS estimates, the effect on the infant mortality&#13;
rate of the decrease in full breastfeeding (FBF) is&#13;
( FBF +lFBFxW    X  W    FBFxT  x   T),&#13;
where W incticates the average value of piped water and T the average value of&#13;
toilet sanitation.&#13;
23/ This contrasts markedly with the findings of our investigation of the&#13;
reasons for the higher infant mortality rates in the four poorest states of&#13;
Peninsular Malaysia (Khairuddin et al., forthcoming). In that analysis,&#13;
differences in the mean levels of explanatory variables between these four&#13;
states and the other seven states of Peninsular Malaysia account for the&#13;
entire dif-Eerence in their average infant mortality rates.&#13;
24/ The coefficient of year in this regression on residuals implies that the&#13;
unexplained time trend between the 1956-60 and 1971-75 periods amounts to 19.7&#13;
deaths per thousand (.00131 x 15 years), much larger than the decline of 9.2&#13;
deaths per thousand explained by the OLS regression.&#13;
The addition of the explanatory variables does not greatly diminish the&#13;
explanatory power of the child's year of birth: The coefficient of year in&#13;
the regression on residuals (-.00131) is over two-thirds the size of the&#13;
coefficient of year when it is the only variable regressed against infant&#13;
mortality (-.00192). The coefficient of year in an OLS regression on infant&#13;
mortality decreases only modestly (to -.00156 (t = -2.39)) when all the&#13;
variables included in Table 2 are controlled. The coefficients of most&#13;
explanatory variables change very little in magnitude or significance when&#13;
child's year of birth is also controlled. The one exception is mother's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
education, whose coefficient decreases in absolute value, from -.00259 (t=-&#13;
2.22) to -.00177 (t=-1.46).&#13;
25/ Means of the explanatory variables for the two samples, and t-tests&#13;
indicating whether they differ significantly, are presented in Appendix Table&#13;
A.5.&#13;
26/ In fact, preliminary estimates indicate a positive (though insignificant)&#13;
slope of the Age &lt;18 spline for births after 1960.&#13;
27/ The average infant mortality rate declined by more than half between the&#13;
two periods for the samples considered here (from 72.3 in 1946-60 to 33.3 in&#13;
1961-75). Hence a decrease in attributable risk would not necessarily also&#13;
cause a decrease in relative risk.&#13;
28/ Because all explanatory variables are interacted with the 1961-75 dummy,&#13;
we cannot necessarily extend this conclusion to other values of the&#13;
explanatory variables.&#13;
29/ We had originally expected the opposite: that mother's education would&#13;
be more important in the earlier period and in low-income/high mortality&#13;
areas, for in those environments there should be fewer ways to substitute for&#13;
the advantages that mother's education conveys. Rosenzweig and Schultz (1982)&#13;
found this substitution hypothesis to hold in urban areas of Colombia, using&#13;
actual data on local health programs. Mott (1982), using data from the Kenyan&#13;
World Fertility Survey, found that primary and secondary school attendance had&#13;
progressively less influence in explaining infant mortality over time in&#13;
Kenya.&#13;
Another reason for expecting a stronger effect of education when infant&#13;
mortality is high is that education has a stronger efffect on post-neonatal&#13;
mortality than on neonatal mortality (e.g., DaVanzo, Butz and Habicht, 1983)&#13;
and the former constitutes a larger portion of infant deaths when infant&#13;
mortality rates are high.&#13;
Preston (1980) by contrast, like us, finds education to be relatively&#13;
more important in more recent years. He considers the influence of literacy&#13;
on life expectancy in developing countries in 1940 and 1970, using country&#13;
aggregates as his units of analysis.&#13;
30/ This possibility was suggested by Doug Ewbank in his insightful&#13;
discussion of this paper at the 1984 meeting of the Population Association of&#13;
America. This led us to investigate this possibility directly by including an&#13;
interaction of duration of unsupplemented breastfeeding and mother's&#13;
education. (The relative advantage of full breastfeeding should be less for&#13;
mothers who know how to provide appropriate supplementary or substitute&#13;
feeding to their infants.) However, this interaction term was never&#13;
statistically significant when added to regressions otherwise like those in&#13;
Tables 2 and 5, though its coefficient was positive, as expected.&#13;
31/ This is true for full and partial breastfeeding (each alone and the&#13;
latter in interaction with toilet sanitation), a preceding short birth&#13;
interval, and Indian ethnicity. It is also true for the total effects of full&#13;
breastfeeding and of toilet sanitation, shown at the bottom of Table 5. Each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
of these effects is much stronger in the earlier period. In fact, Indian&#13;
ethnicity and a short birth interval do not significantly influence infant&#13;
mortality in the sample of births after 1960.&#13;
32/ We reach this same conclusion from a variety of analytic approaches:&#13;
predictions for particular time periods using the fixed-structure&#13;
coefficients, regression of the fixed-structure residuals on time, seeing how&#13;
much the tirne trend in infant mortality is reduced when other explanatory&#13;
variables are added to the fixed-structure regression, and allowing for&#13;
different structures in two periods and using one period's structure and the&#13;
other's mean to predict infant mortality in the latter period.&#13;
33/ We have formally considered this only for the case where all explanatory&#13;
variables are set to zero, but we are confident that the same conclusion would&#13;
arise for many other values of explanatory variables as well.&#13;
34/ There have been specific programs to control or eradicate tuberculosis,&#13;
malaria, leprosy, yaws, filariasis, and dengue hemorrhaegic fever. In 1977,&#13;
the government spent M$44.36 (around U.S. $20) per capita on health activities&#13;
(WHO 1980). The overall allocation to health increased seven-fold between&#13;
1956-60 and 1976-80 (derived from data presented in Abu Bakar, 1981, p. 260)&#13;
and increased as a share of overall public expenditures.&#13;
35/ Without good retrospective data on households' economic well-being and&#13;
the availability and scope of health services, we can of course only speculate&#13;
about the importance of economic growth, expansion of health services, and&#13;
other factors in explaining the infant mortality decline in Malaysia.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
Considerable excitement has been generated in the health and development&#13;
field since the mid-1970s by a number of studies suggesting that the pace of&#13;
mortality decline in the developing world has slowed in the 1960s and 1970s&#13;
from the rapid improvements of the 1950s. The data bases, mortality indices,&#13;
and methodology of these studies have varied widely. The most comprehensive&#13;
analysis has been reported in a series of articles by Preston (1975, 1980,&#13;
1983) who used cross-sectional regression analysis to examine relations&#13;
between expectation of life at birth (and, most recently, infant mortality)&#13;
and development indicators (per capita income, literary and calorie intake)&#13;
around 1940 and 1970 (1980) and during the periods 1965-69 and 1975-79&#13;
(1983). His conclusion is that the relationships between mortality and the&#13;
development indicator remained approximately constant over the period, while&#13;
the rate of improvement attributable to unspecified, exogenous factors&#13;
declined sharply, from about three years of expectation of life per decade up&#13;
to the 1960s to only slightly more than one year in the most recent decade. A&#13;
study of mortality levels and trends by the United Nations (1982) of twenty-&#13;
four developing countries with reasonably reliable estimates of eo for the&#13;
1950s, 1960s and 1970s showed an average annual rate of increase of 0.57 years&#13;
between the 1950s and 1960s, but of only 0.49 years from the 1960s to the&#13;
1970s; the inclusion of a further ten countries for the latter period reduced&#13;
the annual average gain to 0.45 years. The slowdown is largely accounted for&#13;
by the observation for Latin America; the countries of Asia show a modest&#13;
acceleration, those of Africa a modest decline. The slowdown can be partly&#13;
attributed to some of the countries reaching low mortality levels where gains&#13;
tend to be slower, but a cross-tabulation of gains by initial life expectancy&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
shows a slowdown for all initial levels except those between 40 and 50&#13;
years. Probably the most widely cited study is that of Gwatkin (1980) whose&#13;
grapeshot argument is hard to summarize, but who presents a large number of&#13;
indications from diverse sources that the era of unusually rapid developing&#13;
country mortality declines has at least temporarily come to an end.&#13;
The object of this paper is not to review the literature, but rather to&#13;
review the data. In passing, however, it may be noted that Preston's cross-&#13;
national studies incorporate data of highly variable quality (the United&#13;
Nations mortality estimates used are for a number of countries little more&#13;
than informed guesses, and both literacy and calorie availability data are&#13;
notoriously unreliable), and the cross-sectional approach may give misleading&#13;
results if the selection of cases by data availability is biased, as it well&#13;
might be; the stability of the relationships over time argues in their favor,&#13;
however. The United Nations study covers a limited number of countries&#13;
selected by data availability in the 1950s; the average is heavily weighted&#13;
toward Latin American experience, and the availability of data for early&#13;
periods might well be associated with conditions conducive to rapid mortality&#13;
decline. Gwatkin's study focuses either on regional aggregates of United&#13;
Nations mortality estimates (and sometimes expectations) or on the experiences&#13;
of individual countries or small groups of countries; the latter focus is&#13;
hazardous since for any period some countries buck the general trend, a case&#13;
in point being China, where it is now fairly well established (Hill 1983) that&#13;
mortality was higher at the end of the 1950s, as a result of a severe famine,&#13;
than at the beginning. Portrayal of the 1950s as a halcyon decade for&#13;
developing countries is an over-simplification, arrived at by generalizing&#13;
from a limited number of reasonably reliable observations. However, it is one&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
thing to qualify the results of studies on the basis of uncertainty or&#13;
selectivity of observations, but quite another to improve on them. Before&#13;
going any further, it is necessary to examine the data available and their&#13;
deficiencies and to clarify what is meant by the pace of mortality decline.&#13;
Data and Definitions&#13;
Existing studies of mortality decline in developing countries have&#13;
focused on expectation of life at birth, eo, and to a lesser extent on the&#13;
infant mortality rate. Neither of these measures, however, is readily&#13;
estimated by current demographic methodology, an important consideration given&#13;
that only a handful of developing countries have accurate vital registration&#13;
systems that obviate the necessity for the application of such methodology.&#13;
Two more technically appropriate measures have been used in this study:&#13;
(1) the expectation of life at age five for females, ef, adequately estimated&#13;
even from moderately incomplete vital registration data using recently&#13;
developed methods for comparing deaths by age with population by age (there is&#13;
no evidence that estimates for females are in general preferable to estimates&#13;
for males; estimates for females have been used for the sake of simplicity,&#13;
and also because female age distributions tend to be less distorted by&#13;
migration and age-selective under coverage); and (2) the probability of dying&#13;
by age five, q(5), often adequately estimated from reports of women concerning&#13;
the survival of their children. Though the two measures together effectively&#13;
determine eo, for many countries only one of the two is available, so the&#13;
separation into two age ranges maximizes the use of the most reliable&#13;
available indicators. Thus, for sub-Saharan Africa no adequate estimates of&#13;
adult mortality exist, while for China, estimates of child mortality are&#13;
largely conjectural.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
The next question is what should be regarded as the pace of mortality&#13;
decline.  The most obvious measures are the average annual increase in e5f&#13;
and average annual decline in q(5).    Figures 1 and 2 show the trends in these&#13;
two measures for a group of many developed countries in the nineteenth and&#13;
twentieth centuries.   The trends in e5f seem to follow a broadly logistic&#13;
pattern, with five rates of improvement increasing until a level in the mid-&#13;
to upper-60s is reached, and then declining as an asymptotic value around 80&#13;
years is approached. It is not clear, however, whether the initially&#13;
accelerating rate of decline should be interpreted as a characteristic of&#13;
values of e5f or of time periods; the accelerations all occur during the time&#13;
period frorn 1930 to 1960, and the experience of the late entrants into&#13;
mortality decline, with very rapid improvements at high mortality levels,&#13;
suggests that the logistic pattern appears as a result of a combination of&#13;
time period effects and a negative relationship between rate of improvement&#13;
and initial level. Coale and Hoover (1958) suggest "a sort of universal time&#13;
path for the increase in life expectancy in populations able to adopt modern&#13;
procedures for controlling mortality (Coale 1981) such that the rate of change&#13;
in e. is linearly related to the average value of Eo, the rate of increase&#13;
declining as some upper asymptotic value of eo is approached. Recent&#13;
experience in developed countries continues to support such a general path.&#13;
For the purposes of this study, this model of mortality decline suggests that&#13;
we should not expect e0 or e5f to continue to increase linearly indefinitely,&#13;
but that two simple transformations should maintain linearity and compara-&#13;
bility across differing initial levels. The transformations implied are&#13;
f  f  f        f             f       ~   ~~~~~~f  f  -f&#13;
-ln ((e 5(max) - e5 )/(e5 (max) - e5(min)) for e5, and (e5/t)/(e5(max) -e5&#13;
for the rate of change. Both absolute and transformed values will be used,&#13;
though the latter probably provide more suitable measures for cross-national&#13;
&#13;

comparison; the maximum and minimum values adopted are 80 years and 40 years,&#13;
respectively. Figure 3 plots the transformations of the series shown in&#13;
Figure 1. The pattern of decline of q(5) is rather different, and seems in&#13;
general to be approximately linear until quite low values around 0.030 are&#13;
achieved, after which the rate of decline slows down as some lower asymptote&#13;
is approached. This pattern suggests that q(5) should not be transformed, at&#13;
least for values above 0.03, where the vast majority of developing country&#13;
observations are located; below .03, a transformation such as q(5) (1 + (.03-&#13;
q(5))/3(.005-q(5))) linearizes the trend somewhat, as is shown in Figure 4 for&#13;
the series of q(5)'s plotted in Figure 2.&#13;
The first step in investigating the changing pace of mortality decline&#13;
has been to follow the United Nations approach of comparing rates of change of&#13;
the mortality indices, both transformed and untransformed, from the 1950s to&#13;
the 1960s with those from the 1960s to the 1970s; average rates of decline&#13;
have been calculated for the two periods on both an unweighted and a&#13;
population-weighted basis. The analysis has been restricted to countries for&#13;
which the estimates are regarded as fairly reliable and has been subdivided&#13;
into three regions of the developing world: the Americas; sub-Saharan Africa;&#13;
and Asia, Oceania and North Africa--the last, highly heterogeneous group was&#13;
formed because of the small number of a suitable data points for its&#13;
individual components. A finding from the first step that the pace of&#13;
mortality decline has slackened would not, however, be sufficient; it might be&#13;
argued that the slowdown represented a general decline in the impetus of&#13;
development, and should not therefore be laid at the door of the health sector&#13;
in particular. To examine this issue a Preston-type analysis suggests itself,&#13;
one of relating mortality indicators, both untransformed and transformed, to&#13;
indexes of development. The indexes of development chosen are per capita&#13;

and a measure of education, the proportion of the population aged 25 and over&#13;
with no edLLcation for e5f and the proportion of the female population aged 15&#13;
to 44 with no education for q(5).    Educational attainment data have been&#13;
preferred to literacy measures on the grounds of doubts about the&#13;
comparability and reliability of the latter. No measure of calorie&#13;
availability has been incorporated, partly for reasons of skepticism about the&#13;
estimates, but more importantly because nutritional status seems close enough&#13;
to the health sector not to be specifically removed; similar considerations&#13;
apply to the malaria and per capita health aid variables Preston uses (1980).&#13;
In the sections that follow, the results obtained are presented first&#13;
by indicator, ef5 or q(5), and within indicators by region, as defined earlier,&#13;
concluding with a summary for all regions combined. The final section&#13;
presents a summary and conclusions.&#13;
Trends in Female Life expectancy at age 5, ef&#13;
The Americas&#13;
Table 1 shows female life expectancies at age 5 for points in the&#13;
1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, together with, where available, rate of change of&#13;
e5 and its transformation; both unweighted and population-weighted averages of&#13;
the rates of change are shown. It is quite clear that, for the countries&#13;
covered, the pace of mortality decline in the 1950s was faster than in the&#13;
1960s, regardless of whether the observations are weighted or unweighted,&#13;
transformed or untransformed. However, while the unweighted annual rate of&#13;
change almost halves from one decade to the next (0.50 to 0.26), the decline&#13;
in the weighted, transformed measure of rate of change falls by only a quarter&#13;

(0.020 to 0.015). For the small number of countries with observations for&#13;
dates after the early 1970s, the pace of decline seems to have increased&#13;
somewhat again, with unweighted and population weighted averages of 0.31&#13;
(untransformed) and 0.023 (transformed), and 0.32 and 0.021 respectively, as&#13;
shown in Table 2. Thus a straightforward comparison of rates of change&#13;
suggests that the rate of mortality decline was slower in the 1960s than in&#13;
the 1950s, but limited observations for the 1970s suggest that, though the&#13;
absolute rate of improvement was slower than in the 1950s, the rates of&#13;
improvement relative to the assured upper asymptote had returned to roughly&#13;
its 1950s pace. Limiting the comparison only to countries with observations&#13;
for the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s makes only a trivial difference to the&#13;
results.&#13;
We can now turn to the relations between mortality level and&#13;
development indicators. Two approaches, both using unweighted least squares&#13;
regression, have been adopted, the first being to examine these relations for&#13;
the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s observations separately, and the second being to&#13;
pool observations for the 1950s and 1960s, and then for the 1960s and 1970s,&#13;
using a date variable to pick up changes over time in the relationships. For&#13;
both approaches, both the untransformed and the transformed versions of the&#13;
dependent variable eS were used, with the transformed version giving somewhat&#13;
better results in the sense of marginally higher proportion of variance&#13;
explained. The number of observations is small, particularly for the 1950s.&#13;
Table 3 summarizes the results of these analyses, showing the coefficients and&#13;
standard errors of the variables, and the proportion of variance accounted&#13;
for.&#13;
This analysis suggest that the decline in mortality attributable to&#13;
factors other than income and education fell more sharply from the 1950s to&#13;

the 1960s than did the pace of mortality decline overall. Though the&#13;
coefficients do not show the impressive stability of those in Preston's&#13;
analysis, not surprisingly in view of the limited number and range of the&#13;
observations, the signs are always in the expected direction, and the&#13;
coefficients of the education variable are always significant at the five&#13;
percent level, as are those of per capita income except for the 1950s. In a&#13;
hypothetical country with a per capita income of $800 and 30 percent aged 25&#13;
and over with no education, female life expectancy would have increased by&#13;
0.18 of a year per year from the 1950s to the 1960s, but by only 0.07 of a&#13;
year per year from the 1960s to the 1970s. The coefficients of the date&#13;
variable in the pooled regressions confirm these orders of magnitude: an&#13;
annual increase of 0.19 for the 1950s and 1960s, but only 0.04 for the 1960s&#13;
and 1970s. Using the transformed version of life expectancy, however, the&#13;
picture is less clear; the annual change in the dependent variable is -0.0069&#13;
from the 1950s to the 1960s, and -0.0055 from the 1960s to the 1970s, a less&#13;
than spectacular change of pace, though using the pooled observations, the&#13;
date coefficient falls for the 1960s and 1970s to only one-third of its value&#13;
for the 1950s and 1960s. The rates of decline are rather slower than those&#13;
estimated by Preston for developing countries as a whole.&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
There are no countries of sub-Saharan Africa (except Mauritius, which&#13;
has been included with East and South Asia) for which satisfactory estimates&#13;
of adult mortality exist. Death registration is virtually nonexistent, and&#13;
errors of age misreporting and census coverage are so substantial that&#13;
intercensal survival techniques give rise to highly questionable results.&#13;
Estimation techniques based on questions of survival of mothers, fathers, and&#13;
spouses give rise to estimates of uncertain level and reference period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
Asia, Oceania, and North Africa&#13;
This region is little better off than sub-Saharan Africa; only a&#13;
handful of small countries have satisfactory registration of deaths, and only&#13;
another handful have adequate estimates of adult mortality not based directly&#13;
on registered deaths.    Table 4 shows the available estimates by decade (a&#13;
study with more time at its disposal could turn up some additional points such&#13;
as for Singapore; for Taiwan, China, recently; or for Thailand). The figures&#13;
given suggest some slight deceleration of mortality decline over the period,&#13;
of about 25 percent for unweighted cases, and about 15 percent for weighted&#13;
cases. It is interesting to note that the rates of decline for this group of&#13;
countries are very similar to those for developing countries in the Americas,&#13;
especially for the weighted cases. No firm conclusions can be drawn from&#13;
these figures, however, since they omit the three largest countries of the&#13;
region, China, India, and Indonesia. For China, e5f was probably lower in 1960&#13;
than in 1950, because of a major crisis around 1960, and then rose very&#13;
sharply, by at least 15 years, from 1960 to 1970, and has continued a rapid&#13;
advance since then; if China were included (unfortunately the estimates are&#13;
not sufficiently secure), the weighted rate of mortality decline would be&#13;
higher in the 1960s than in the 1950s. Estimates for India are less soundly&#13;
based, but recent work by Preston and others (Preston et al., forthcoming)&#13;
suggests a, quite rapid increase in e5f in the 1960s. No convincing estimates&#13;
of adult mortality in Indonesia are available. Given these major holes in the&#13;
data, no firm conclusions can be drawn. The analysis is also sensitive to the&#13;
dates chosen; Sri Lanka enjoyed an extremely rapid mortality decline between&#13;
1947 and 1953, so an annual rate of change calculated from 1947 to 1963 would&#13;
have been much larger than that calculated from 1953 to 1963; China&#13;
experienced a major mortality increase around 1960, so annual rates of change&#13;

over the period 1950 to 1960 would give a radically different picture than&#13;
over the period 1955 to 1965; Bangladesh suffered disaster-related mortality&#13;
increases in, the early 1970s. Such mortality fluctuations clearly do occur in&#13;
developing countries at levels of life expectancy where they were rare in the&#13;
now-developed world, though Sweden during the depression and central Europe&#13;
and Japan at the end of the second world war did suffer mortality reversals.&#13;
Rates of change of e5 for the first half of the 1970s are available&#13;
only for Hong Kong and Peninsular Malaysia. The population-weighted absolute&#13;
annual average rate of change is 0.30, very similar to the average for the&#13;
1960s to 1910s, and somewhat slower than that for the 1950s-60s period; the&#13;
transformed rate of change, however, at 0.028 is somewhat faster than for&#13;
either of tlhe two preceding periods. There is thus no evidence of any marked&#13;
change in the recent past from prior trends.&#13;
Regression analysis has been used to examine changes in relationships&#13;
between e5f and per capita income and education, first looking at cross-&#13;
sectional relationships in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, and then pooling&#13;
observations for the 1950s and 1960s, and 1960s and 1970s, together with a&#13;
date variable. Results are summarized in Table 5. For the 1950s alone, the&#13;
results are clearly unsatisfactory, with a negative income coefficient and low&#13;
goodness of fit. The remaining analyses, however, are quite satisfactory,&#13;
with coefficients of the expected sign and acceptable goodness of fit; it is&#13;
also interesting to note that the coefficients in Table 5 are similar to those&#13;
for the Americas in Table 3, not only in absolute terms but also in change&#13;
over time, with the effects of income and education declining from the 1960s&#13;
to the 1970s, though the effect of income increases for the pooled regressions&#13;
from the 1950s-60s to the 1960s-70s. Gains in ef5 not attributable to changes&#13;

in income and education have not been calculated because of the poor 1950s&#13;
fit; howevEr, the pooled regressions (though no doubt adversely affected by&#13;
the 1950s observations) suggest a fairly substantial gain of 0.30 of a year&#13;
per year not attributable to income and education improvements from the 1950s&#13;
to the 1960s, but no such gain (in fact a slight loss) from the 1960s to&#13;
1970s. Asian experience thus appears similar to that of Latin America;&#13;
although adulL female mortality continued to fall from the 1960s to the 1970s,&#13;
the pace oE decline was somewhat slower, and the decline can largely be&#13;
explained in terms of rising per capita income and education levels, whereas&#13;
from the 1950s to the 1960s other factors made a substantial contribution to&#13;
the observed decline. For a hypothetical country increasing its per capita&#13;
income from $500 to $750, and reducing its proportion aged 25 and over with no&#13;
education from 0.50 to 0.35 between 1960 and 1970, the 1950s-60s pooled&#13;
regression would imply a gain in e5 from 62.4 years to 69.2 years, or 6.8&#13;
years, whereas the 1960s-70s equation would imply a change from 63.8 years to&#13;
66.6 years or 2.8 years; comparable figures for the Americas would be 56.3&#13;
years to 62.7 years for a gain of 6.4 years using the 1950s-60s relationship,&#13;
and 56.3 years to 61.1 years for a gain of 4.8 years using the 1960s-70s&#13;
relation. Both regions show lower gains using the more recent relationship,&#13;
but much more so for Asia than for Latin America.     The use of T(e ) in place&#13;
5&#13;
of e5 makes virtually no difference to these observations; for Asia, the rate&#13;
of decline using the 1960s-70s relationship would have been only one-third of&#13;
that using the 1950s-60s relation, whereas for the Americas it would be about&#13;
two thirds, though at a higher mortality level.&#13;

Trend in the Probability of Dying by Age 5, q(5)&#13;
The Americas&#13;
Table 6 shows probabilities of dying by age 5 for the 1950s, 1960s,&#13;
and 1970s for countries of developing America for which relatively accurate&#13;
measures are available. The annual rates of change shown in the last two&#13;
columns show a good deal of variability from one decade to the next. The&#13;
unweighted average change from the 1960s to the 1970s was about three-quarters&#13;
of that shown for the previous decade; when weighted by approximate numbers of&#13;
births, the 1960s-70s rate of decline is only about one-eighth lower than that&#13;
of the 1950s-60s; the slowdown in decline of child mortality is thus somewhat&#13;
less marked than that of female adult mortality (Table 1). Rates of change&#13;
for the 1970s, shown in Table 7, are available for only a small number of&#13;
countries, but on a birth weighted basis show no dramatic change in the rate&#13;
of mortality decline.&#13;
Regression analysis has again been used to examine the relationship&#13;
between q(5) and two development indicators, per capita income and the&#13;
proportion of women aged 15 to 44 with no schooling. Cross sectional analyses&#13;
for the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, and pooled regressions for the 1950s-60s, and&#13;
1960s-70s using a date variable have been carried out, with results shown in&#13;
Table 8. The coefficients all have the expected signs, and the goodness of&#13;
the fits is reasonable. Per capita income is only significant in the 1960s-&#13;
70s pooled regression, but the female education variable is highly significant&#13;
in all equations, with fairly stable coefficients. The results again suggest&#13;
that the mortality decline associated with the two development indicators used&#13;
did not change greatly, though per capita income contributes somewhat more in&#13;
the more recent past, while the decline associated with other factors has&#13;

fallen sharply. The date variable in the pooled regressions, though never&#13;
significant, is negative and close to significance for the 1950s-60s equation&#13;
but positive and nowhere approaching significance in the 1960s-70s equation.&#13;
For a hypothetical country with a per capita income of $800 and a proportion&#13;
of females aged 15 to 44 with no education of 0.25, q(5) would, according to&#13;
the cross-sectional regressions, have fallen from 0.153 in the 1950s to 0.134&#13;
in the 1960s, an annual decline of 0.0019, but would have increased again to&#13;
0.158 in the 1970s.    Substituting the same values into the pooled regressions&#13;
would imply values of 0.153 for 1950 and 0.136 for 1960 using the 1950s-60s&#13;
pooled regression, and values of 0.140 for 1960 and 0.144 for 1970 using the&#13;
1960s-70s pooled regression.    In a hypothetical country enjoying steady&#13;
development with per capita income increasing by 3 percent per annum from $800&#13;
in 1950 and the proportion of females aged 15-44 with no education declining&#13;
from 0.4 in 1950 to 0.3 in 1960 to 0.2 in 1970, q(5) would have declined by&#13;
0.004 per annum for the 1950s-60s pooled regression, but by 0.003 per annum&#13;
for the 1960-70s pooled regression. All these examples support the&#13;
conclusion that the pace of decline of child mortality slowed somewhat from&#13;
the 1950s to the 1960s.&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
Table 9 shows estimates of q(5) for countries of tropical Africa by&#13;
time period. All the estimates have been obtained from census or survey child&#13;
survival data, with q(5) being obtained by averaging the mortality levels&#13;
implied in the Coale-Demeny "North" model life tables by the proportions dead&#13;
among children ever born to women aged 20 to 34; the estimates have been&#13;
"dated", usually four or five years before the survey date, using procedures&#13;
developed by Coale and Trussell (1977), but no use has been made of child&#13;

mortality trends implied by estimates from a single survey; omission of dead&#13;
children by older women may be expected to distort such internal trends.&#13;
As with the Americas, the rate of decline of q(5) does seem to have&#13;
been somewhat slower from the 1960s to the 1970s than over the preceding&#13;
decade. On a birth weighted basis, the average rate of decline was 0.0048 for&#13;
the 1950s-60s, but only 0.0033 for the 1960s-70s. However, the number of&#13;
observations is small; only one country, Kenya, provides estimates for all&#13;
three time periods (though it does show some reduction in the pace of&#13;
decline), and Rwanda, with a marked increase in q(5) from 1966 to 1975,&#13;
greatly affects the rate of decline for the later period.&#13;
Table 10 summarizes the results of regressions of q(5) on per capita&#13;
income and the proportion of women aged 15 to 44 with no education and, for&#13;
two pooled regressions, a date variable (years from 1945). The coefficients&#13;
of the development variables have the expected signs and are, except for&#13;
education for the 1950s, remarkably stable, but the amount of variance&#13;
accounted for is, again with the exception of the 1950s, very low, and the&#13;
coefficients do not achieve significance at the 5 percent level except for the&#13;
education variable in the two pooled regressions. The date variable is not&#13;
significant in either of the pooled regression; its coefficient is very small&#13;
and positive for the 1950s-60s observations, but somewhat larger and negative&#13;
for the 1960s-70s observations. Thus, though the evidence is very weak,&#13;
factors other than per capita income and maternal education do appear to have&#13;
contributed something to the decline in q(5) from the 1960s to the 1970s,&#13;
whereas their contribution to decline from the 1950s to the 1960s appears to&#13;
have been negligible.&#13;

It is interesting to compare these sub-Saharan Africa results with&#13;
those for developing America in Table 8. In the Americas, about 75 percent of&#13;
the variance of q(5) is typically accounted for by per capita income and&#13;
maternal education, while in sub-Saharan Africa these factors account for only&#13;
about 30 percent of the variance. One possible explanation of the difference&#13;
would be that measurement error for all the African data is larger than for&#13;
the Americas data, but it is hard to believe that most of the difference could&#13;
arise from this cause. In many of the African cases, the child mortality&#13;
trends show convincing consistency from one survey to another, and there is no&#13;
reason to believe that the estimates of q(5) are greatly in error (cases with&#13;
marked inconsistencies have been excluded); they almost certainly are less&#13;
reliable than those for the Americas, but not greatly so. Similarly, there is&#13;
no reason to suppose that the educational data are much worse for Africa than&#13;
for the Americas. Per capita income figures probably are substantially worse&#13;
in Africa, putting a high value on output of the formal sector, and a low&#13;
value on output of the subsistence sector; thus the contrast between Zambia,&#13;
with a per capita income of $1008 in 1965, and Lesotho, with $159 in 1968,&#13;
appears exaggerated, as does that between Ghana, $558 in 1966, and Kenya, $250&#13;
in 1965. However, error in per capita income cannot be the major problem&#13;
since the education variable is also generally not significant. The most&#13;
likely explanation would appear to be that much of the variability of child&#13;
mortality in Africa arises from aetiological and cultural factors not closely&#13;
associated with per capita income and education. The coefficients of income&#13;
are much the same in sub-Saharan Africa as in the Americas, though less&#13;
significant, whereas the coefficients of female education in sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa are about one-half those in the Americas; the average educational level&#13;
is much lower in Africa, and the difference in size of the coefficients may&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

suggest that a non-linear transformation of the proportion with no education&#13;
should be used to reflect possibly more rapid increases in more advanced&#13;
education at low proportions uneducated than at high proportions uneducated&#13;
(average number of years of education might be a better variable).&#13;
The analysis does not provide a satisfactory answer to the question&#13;
of whether the pace of child mortality decline has been changing in sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa. Birth-weighted average annual rates of change in q(5) were&#13;
lower from the 1960s to the 1970s than from the 1950s to the 1960s, but a&#13;
rather unsatisfactory analysis of the factors associated with levels of q(5)&#13;
suggests that the effects of per capita income and female education remained&#13;
much the same over the period, while other date-related factors made no&#13;
contribution to mortality decline from the 1950s to the 1960s, but contributed&#13;
slightly to mortality declines from the 1960s to the 1970s.&#13;
Asia, Oceania, and North Africa&#13;
Table 11 shows estimates of q(5) by date from the 1950s to the 1970s&#13;
for developing countries of the residual region. The unweighted average rate&#13;
of change in q(5) was substantially faster for the 1950s to 1960s than for the&#13;
1960s to 1970s, but the birth weighted average decline was faster for the&#13;
later period than for the earlier. The unweighted average is heavily affected&#13;
by very fast decline in the early 1960s in Bahrain, where the rate of decline&#13;
was probably maintained more recently, though reliable estimates are lacking.&#13;
The weighted average is heavily affected by apparently rapid decline in&#13;
Indonesia in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It should be noticed however&#13;
that for all the countries with observations for each of the three decades,&#13;
except the Republic of Korea, the rate of decline was faster from the 1950s to&#13;
the 1960s than from the 1960s to the 1970s. This evidence must therefore be&#13;
regarded aLs inconclusive; there may have been some acceleration of the rate of&#13;

decline of child mortality overall (rather weak estimates for China and India&#13;
would support this contention), but this is certainly not the case for all&#13;
countries, among them most of those with reliable data. Points for the mid-&#13;
1970s, for Hong Kong, Peninsular Malaysia, and Thailand, indicate slower rates&#13;
of decline than in the 1960s, though, at least in the case of Hong Kong, q(5)&#13;
had reached a level, around 0.020, where a slowdown was to be expected.&#13;
Estimates of q(5) have once again been related to the two development&#13;
indicators, per capita income and the proportion of women aged 15 to 44 with&#13;
no education; the results are summarized in Table 12. Once again, all the&#13;
coefficients have the expected sign, and with the exception of the 1950s cross&#13;
section the fits are impressive and the development indicators clearly&#13;
significant. The poor fit of the 1950s equation makes it pointless to&#13;
calculate the decadal reductions in q(5) for a typical country. However, the&#13;
two pooled regressions suggest that there was little shift in the relationship&#13;
between q(5) and development indicators either from the 1950s to the 1960s or&#13;
from the 1960s to the 1970s, the date variable being insignificant in both&#13;
cases, and the coefficients of per capita income and maternal education&#13;
remaining approximately constant. Comparing the coefficients with those&#13;
estimated for Africa and America, the effect of maternal education appears&#13;
similar to its effect in the Americas, and thus more marked than in sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa, while the effect of per capita income appears to be stronger&#13;
than in either the Americas or Africa; child mortality appears to be more&#13;
responsive to development than in the Americas or Africa, while female adult&#13;
mortality had been, if anything, somewhat less responsive.&#13;

Summary and Conclusions&#13;
The analysis presented in this paper has been limited to developing&#13;
countries with mortality estimates that are regarded as reasonably reliable.&#13;
Developed countries have been excluded altogether, though it would be&#13;
interesting to see whether their mortality trends reveal patterns similar to&#13;
those for developing countries. Observations for a total of fifty-three&#13;
countries, seventeen in the developing Americas, twenty-one in sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa, and fifteen in Asia, Oceania and North Africa are included at some&#13;
point or another in the analysis; in terms of the total populations of these&#13;
groupings, most of the Americas, somewhat less than half of sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa, and less than a quarter of Asia, Oceania and North Africa are&#13;
included. The conclusions drawn must therefore be regarded as tentative at&#13;
best, with the caveat that they apply only to the countries under observation.&#13;
Limiting the analysis to relatively reliable observations, at the cost of&#13;
broader representativeness, was preferred to the alternative strategy of&#13;
improving representativeness at the cost of reliability. An additional cost&#13;
of the insistence on reliability is a lack of very recent observations.&#13;
Two mortality measures have been used: female life expectancy at age&#13;
5, e5, to represent adult mortality, and the probability of dying by age 5 for&#13;
both sexes to represent child mortality.   A transformation of ef, T(ef ) the&#13;
rate of gain relative to an upper asymptote taken as 80 years, has also been&#13;
used to allow for any deceleration in absolute rates of change at high life&#13;
expectancies.   Population weighted average rates of change in both e5f and&#13;
5&#13;
T(ef) support the view that rates of adult mortality decline were somewhat&#13;
5&#13;
slower from the 1960s to the 1970s than from the 1950s to the 1960s; on an&#13;
untransformed basis, the average rate of improvement for the later period was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
71 percent of that for the earlier period for the Americas, and 82 percent for&#13;
Asia, Oceania and North Africa, corresponding values for the transformed&#13;
variable being 75 percent and 85 percent respectively. No observations for&#13;
sub-Saharan Africa were included. Birth weighted average rates of change in&#13;
q(5) suggest also some deceleration in the rate of decline of child mortality&#13;
in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa (88 percent and 69 percent respectively&#13;
in the later period of their rates of change in the earlier period), but a&#13;
substantial acceleration (169 percent) for Asia, Oceania and North Africa. It&#13;
is interesting to note that the weighted average rates of decline are quite&#13;
similar across regional groupings, though the declines in q(5) for the Asia&#13;
grouping from the 1960s to the 1970s, and for sub-Saharan Africa from the&#13;
1950s to the 1960s, are faster than elsewhere. This comparison of rates of&#13;
mortality decline suggests that if there has been any deceleration in the&#13;
rates, it has not been very large and has affected Asia less than the Americas&#13;
and sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
Regression analysis has been used to examine the relationships&#13;
between the mortality indicators on the one hand and development indicators,&#13;
specifically per capita income and proportions with no education, on the other&#13;
in order to see whether any slowdown in mortality decline could be accounted&#13;
for in terms of a general slowdown in development. Pooled regressions&#13;
combining observations for the 1950s and 1960s and 1960s and 1970s, together&#13;
with an explicit time variable (years since 1945) gave generally rather&#13;
satisfactory results, though the fits for sub-Saharan Africa were poor.&#13;
Though the time variable was never significant, it implied a trend toward&#13;
lower mortality independent of income and education from the 1950s to the&#13;
1960s for the Americas and Africa, but no such trend for Asia from the 1950s&#13;
to the 1960s, or for any region from the 1960s to the 1970s. The coefficients&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
of the income and education variables remained fairly constant over time,&#13;
though varying by region. It should be remembered that these regressions are&#13;
based on unweighted observations.&#13;
The pooled regression analyses have been used to calculate rates of&#13;
change in the mortality indicators for two hypothetical countries, one with a&#13;
per capita income of $400 in 1952 and 70 percent with no education (of the&#13;
population 25 and over for the e5 regressions, but of the female population&#13;
aged 15 to 44 for the q(5) regressions) improving to $540 and 63 percent by&#13;
1962, and to $729 and 56 percent by 1972, the other more developed, with per&#13;
capita income rising from $800 to $984 to $1328 by 1972, and percentage with&#13;
no education falling, from 30 to 23 to 16 by 1972.     Table 13 shows the&#13;
expected rates of change by pooled regression and region with (a) time and the&#13;
development: indicators charging; (b) only the development indicators changing,&#13;
time fixed at 1962; and (c) only time changing, the development indicator&#13;
fixed at 19362 values. The contribution of the development indicators to&#13;
mortality change are remarkably consistent between pools within regions;&#13;
almost all the difference in rate of mortality change is accounted for by the&#13;
date variable, which can be interpreted as changes over time in exogenous&#13;
factors. Such factors apparently contributed to the rate of decline of adult&#13;
mortality from the 1950s to the 1960s in both the Americas and the Asia group,&#13;
but not to the rates of decline from the 1960s to the 1970s, and to the rate&#13;
of decline of child mortality from the 1950s to the 1960s in the Americas, and&#13;
from the 1960s to the 1970s in sub-Saharan Africa, but not otherwise. The&#13;
nature of these exogenous factors is not revealed by the analysis; leading&#13;
candidates would be government commitment to health projects (per capita&#13;
public expenditure on health would be an interesting variable to include, but&#13;
beyond the scope of this analysis), government stability and cause of death&#13;

mix; dissemination of health knowledge is probably accounted for largely by&#13;
the education variable.&#13;
The pooled regressions throw up some other interesting indications.&#13;
The Americas and sub-Saharan Africa seem to have similar mortality levels for&#13;
similar development levels, whereas mortality in Asia seems, other things&#13;
being equal, to be substantially lower, both for adults and children. Child&#13;
mortality seems to be somewhat more responsive to development in Asia than in&#13;
either the Americas or sub-Saharan Africa, where it appears to be least&#13;
responsive; the effects of development on adult mortality seem, however, to be&#13;
similar in both Asia and the Americas. Links between mortality and&#13;
development are strong in the Americas and in Asia, but much weaker in Africa;&#13;
presumably in Africa, living conditions, customs, and the presence or absence&#13;
of disease vectors vary widely in ways not closely associated with per capita&#13;
income and education.&#13;
In conclusion, it seems likely that there has been, on average, some&#13;
slowdown in the pace of mortality decline from the 1950s-60s to the 1960s-70s&#13;
in the Americas; there may also have been some slowdown in sub-Saharan Africa,&#13;
though the evidence is not conclusive. In Asia, however, there may have been&#13;
some acceleration, at least in the rate of decline of child mortality. The&#13;
slowdown in the Americas was not associated with a general slowdown in&#13;
development, whereas in Africa it probably was; in Asia, the pace of decline&#13;
was maintained or increased by a speed-up of development. Effects of income&#13;
and education improvements appear to have remained more or less constant over&#13;
time and to be similar across regions, whereas the effects of other factors&#13;
appear virtually to have disappeared in the recent past. Even where there has&#13;
been a slowdown, however, it has not been all that sharp, and it has probably&#13;
attracted more attention globally than it deserves. This is not to say that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
stalls in mortality decline in particular countries have not occurred, nor&#13;
that such stalls should not be a cause for concern for those countries.&#13;
Argentina and Uruguay show virtually no recent mortality decline at levels of&#13;
life expectancy where developed countries still showed reasonable rates of&#13;
decline; mortality decline in Mauritius has slowed sharply, and possibly&#13;
reversed in Sri Lanka; Bangladesh suffered increasing mortality in the early&#13;
1970s, as did China around 1960. Fluctuations in mortality do occur; what&#13;
appears to be surprising is that fluctuations in mortality are occuring in&#13;
developing countries at levels of life expectancy where decline was fairly&#13;
regular, barring wars, in the now developed world. Perhaps we should not have&#13;
been surprised; developing countries now have mortality levels way below those&#13;
of developed countries at similar levels of development, and mortality&#13;
reductions may be more fragile in the face of wars, natural disasters, and&#13;
disease evolutions. The next decade may be particularly difficult in tropical&#13;
Africa, with the appearance of malaria strains resistant to the prophylactic&#13;
and even therapeutic use of chloroquine. There does not, however, seem to be&#13;
any critical point where further progress is particularly difficult; China,&#13;
with probably low general development scores, has reduced mortality to very&#13;
low levels without any apparent stall; countries of Central America and the&#13;
Caribbean have reduced their mortality to levels below those of Argentina and&#13;
Uruguay, again without any apparent stall; low mortality levels have been&#13;
achieved in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Korea without reversal. It would seem&#13;
that there is no need for global concern, but rather attention to the specific&#13;
countries where mortality decline has stalled in order to identify and rectify&#13;
the factors responsible.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
The period from the 1930 to the 1960s was one of&#13;
unprecedented mortality decline in developing countries. In cross&#13;
sectional analyses of factors which may be responsible for this&#13;
rapid improvement in survivorship, Preston (1975, 1980)&#13;
demonstrated that only about 30 percent of the improvement could&#13;
be explained by measurable aspects of social and economic&#13;
development such as income, literacy, and nutrition. A more&#13;
sluggish pace of mortality decline apparently characterized the&#13;
decade that began in the middle of the 1960s. The purpose of this&#13;
paper is to carry out an analysis similar to the earlier ones but&#13;
concentrated on this later period. The study finds that, contrary&#13;
to previous periods, the social and economic variables of income,&#13;
literacy, and nutrition were the dominating factors in explaining&#13;
mortality decline during the 1965-69 to 1975-79 decade. This&#13;
greater relative role does not result from faster improvements in&#13;
social and economic conditions during the recent period or from an&#13;
increased responsiveness of mortality to social and economic&#13;
variables. Rather, the exoghenous factors appear to have operated&#13;
with sharply reduced intensity in the more recent period.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
This paper is an attempt to update results reported in two earlier&#13;
papers regarding the role of socioeconomic factors in world-wide mortality&#13;
declines since the 1930s. Preston (1975) demonstrated that the relationship&#13;
between life expectancy at birth (eo) and per capita income (in constant&#13;
dollars) had shifted between the 1930s and the 1960s. A country at a&#13;
particular level of national income per capita was estimated to have a level&#13;
of life expectancy at birth that was, on average, 9.7 years higher in the&#13;
1960s than it would have been in the 1930s at that same level of income. This&#13;
shift was clearly attributable to factors other than measured income gains,&#13;
although it is possible that measured gains are biased indicators of true&#13;
gains.&#13;
In an attempt to identify the contribution of advances in literacy&#13;
and nutrition to this apparent shift, Preston (1980a) added these variables to&#13;
income in regression equations estimated with data on 36 countries around 1940&#13;
and on 120 countries around 1970. For less developed countries (LDCs), the&#13;
shift in the relationship between 1940 and 1970 was estimated to be 8.8 years&#13;
after these variables were introduced along with income (Preston 1980a:&#13;
307). Thus, literacy and nutritional gains were responsible for relatively&#13;
little of the shift. This new shift factor accounted for exactly half of the&#13;
17.6 year gain in life expectancy that was estimated by the World Health&#13;
Organization (WHO) to have occurred between these approximate dates. However,&#13;
the estimate of the structural shift did not include data on China, whereas&#13;
China was included in the WHO data on LDC life expectancy gains. Since&#13;
Chinese progress was remarkably rapid and since China represents 30 percent of&#13;
total LDC population and is likely to have gained 30 years in e0 between these&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -&#13;
dates (Banister and Preston 1981), the remaining LDCs would have gained an&#13;
average of only 12.3 years in e0. So the 8.7 year shift would have&#13;
representecl 71 percent of the total gain for the LDCs except China.&#13;
These results seem sufficient to show that mortality trends are not&#13;
dominated by a simple mechanistic input-output relation between mortality and&#13;
other prominently observed features of the economy and society. While&#13;
relations between mortality and these development indicators are very tight at&#13;
both the household and the national levels, there is clearly room for other&#13;
factors to play a role, and these factors seem to have been dominant in&#13;
producing change during the period from the 1930s to 1970.&#13;
What is the nature of these factors? Schultz (1979) quite correctly&#13;
cautions that the above exercises help to rule out certain explanations, or at&#13;
least to define their explanatory power more precisely, but are not helpful in&#13;
defining the factors that were actually operative. Preston (1980a) suggests&#13;
that anti-malarial campaigns were a leading source of the shift, since they&#13;
were cheap to implement (and often subsidized by international donors),&#13;
widespread, and evidently quite effective. But he notes that slight changes&#13;
in statistical procedures have a large impact on the estimated size of&#13;
Malaria's contributions. Subsequently, he suggested without convincing&#13;
demonstration that anti-malarial activities were the largest source of the&#13;
gains, followed by immunization campaigns and improvements in personal health&#13;
practices (Preston, 1980b).&#13;
Later work, though cross-sectional, would seem to underscore the&#13;
importance! of personal health practices. Mosely (1983) argues that government&#13;
health care programs have been largely ineffective because of poor administra-&#13;
tion and biases toward inappropriate western-style medical technology. A more&#13;
persuasive explanation of recent mortality improvement in Kenya, he argues, is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 105 -&#13;
advances in literacy. In this matter he has much support. Mothers'&#13;
educational attainment or literacy has repeatedly emerged as one of the&#13;
strongest and most persistent correlates of child mortality in LDCs (Caldwell&#13;
1979, Schultz 1979, Cochrane 1980, Farah and Preston 1982, Wolfe and Behrman&#13;
1982, Mensch et. al. 1983). While gains in literacy per se cannot account&#13;
for the shift in mortality/development relations, the importance of education&#13;
in cross-sectional relations points to a major role for personal health care&#13;
knowledge and practices in child mortality. Both knowledge and practice can&#13;
be affected by many factors other than formal schooling, and one could&#13;
postulate that there has been a general diffusion of health practices as their&#13;
power becomes demonstrated and as communication systems improve. The&#13;
importance of ethnic group membership in explaining child mortality variation,&#13;
even after many socioeconomic factors have been controlled, is further&#13;
suggestive evidence of the importance of child care practices, which&#13;
presumably vary considerably among ethnic groups (Mensch et. al. 1983).&#13;
According to this latter explanation, mortality advance is largely a&#13;
product of widespread diffusion of knowledge, rather than of socioeconomic&#13;
advance or of enlightened government programs, Obviously, these three&#13;
processes are not mutually exclusive and each process is likely to have&#13;
contributed to the gains that have been made, with their relative&#13;
contributions likely to change from period to period.&#13;
Mortality Declines Since 1965&#13;
There have been many suggestions that the pace of mortality&#13;
improvement in LDCs has slowed since the middle of the 1960s (Hansluwka 1975,&#13;
Gwatkin 1981). Such a decline would coincide with a period of lagging&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
commitments of international aid for health purposes, especially for anti-&#13;
malarial programs (Preston 1980a). In a careful investigation of this&#13;
question, the United Nations (1982a) concluded that, for the 24 LDCs that&#13;
could supply reasonably reliable mortality information in the 1950s, 1960s,&#13;
and 1970s the average gain in life expectancy was .57 years per calendar year&#13;
between the 1950s and 1960s and .49 years per calendar year between the 1960s&#13;
and 1970s. Relaxing the restriction that a country have data for three&#13;
periods and admitting countries with only two observations, the study finds&#13;
that the avierage pace of change declined from .61 to .43 years per year&#13;
between the two decades. The relatively small decline in the rate of&#13;
mortality adivance was essentially confined to Latin American countries, and&#13;
some of the decline there was attributed to several countries' having reached&#13;
high levels of life expectancy where rates of advance are normally slow.&#13;
The mildly pessimistic picture that emerges for the selectively few&#13;
LDCs with adequate data requires emendation for developing countries as an&#13;
aggregate. As noted earlier, China has had a remarkably rapid mortality&#13;
decline, and much of it was concentrated in the period since the early&#13;
1960s. Recently released age distributions from the 1953 and 1964 censuses&#13;
suggest that life expectancy at birth for the intercensal period was extremely&#13;
low, probably in the range of 38-46 years. 1/ The Great Leap Forward&#13;
disasters of 1959-61 may have been largely responsible for this low level. By&#13;
1974, life expectancy had risen to about 63 years, representing a gain of&#13;
about 1.33 years per calendar year from a figure of 42 years at the center of&#13;
the intercensal period. Weighted averages of LDC gains are highly influenced&#13;

by the rapid Chinese progress and therefore show faster progress than&#13;
unweighted figures.&#13;
Unfortunately, we are not able to deal with China in this paper&#13;
because it lacks pertinent developmental indicators. We will deal instead&#13;
with the remaining 70 percent of the developing world, where there are&#13;
indications of a recent slowdown in the pace of mortality change. Our aim is&#13;
to estimate the amount of shift in the relation between mortality and other&#13;
development indicators during the period from 1965-69 to 1975-79. The results&#13;
will provide a reading on whether the shift in the relation has kept pace with&#13;
the average shift of about 3 years in life expectancy per decade that was&#13;
recorded during earlier, longer periods.&#13;
A wide variety of procedures was used to investigate this issue. In&#13;
all cases a mortality indicator was used as the dependent variable in a cross-&#13;
national regression analysis that includes data from LDCs and developed&#13;
countries (MDCs). In all cases the set of independent variables included some&#13;
transformation of the percentage of adults who were literate, gross domestic&#13;
product per capita in constant dollars, and the excess of per capita daily&#13;
calories supplied above 1500 (approximately the amount required to meet&#13;
minimum metabolic demands). The Appendix presents the data and sources&#13;
used. It should be stressed that the estimates, particularly for 1975-79, are&#13;
subject to large amounts of measurement error. For example, it is likely&#13;
that, by 1982 when the UN data were published, fewer than half of the&#13;
developing countries would have produced direct information on mortality&#13;
conditions during 1975-79. When data were missing, the UN used various rules&#13;
of thumb, empirical regularities, and typical relations among groups of&#13;
countries to fill the breach. We have no reason, however, to feel that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -&#13;
mortality (or other) estimates are systematically biased. A number of&#13;
alternatives were introduced into the estimation:&#13;
(a) Life expectancy at birth vs. infant mortality rates. The United&#13;
Nations (1982b) recently completed a large project to estimate infant&#13;
mortality rates for all countries since 1950. Therefore, it is possible for&#13;
the first time to examine relations between an important age-specific&#13;
mortality rate and various development indicators. Infant mortality rates are&#13;
known with less precision than life expectancy because the widely available&#13;
intercensal comparisons are quite informative for the latter but provide&#13;
almost no information on the former.&#13;
(b)  Conventional measures of GDP per capita versus International&#13;
Comparison Project (ICP) measures. The former measures are based upon&#13;
international exchange rates, which are subject to many distortions. The&#13;
latter measures are based on purchasing power parities of various currencies,&#13;
estimated by applying relations found in 16 intensively investigated countries&#13;
to a much wider group of countries (Summers et. al. 1980).&#13;
(c) Functional forms of equations. It is not obvious that any particular&#13;
functional form of the regressions is to be preferred to all others, so&#13;
several of the most attractive candidates were used. These forms include log-&#13;
linear and logistic equations estimated separately for each year. They also&#13;
include equations estimated on the basis of pooled cross-sectional data for&#13;
the two dates, with shift terms and with and without interaction terms.&#13;
(d) Weighted and unweighted regressions. It is possible that smaller&#13;
countries have greater variance in their mortality estimates, in which case&#13;
weighted regressions would reduce heteroskedasticity.&#13;
&#13;

Results Using Life Expectancy&#13;
The unweighted regression equations for life expectancy in 1965-69&#13;
and 1975-79, using the same functional form used previously, are:&#13;
1965-69  e0   =  5.506  +  2.684 InY   +  .238 LIT +  2.854 lnCAL      R   = .919&#13;
(6.651)   (0.486)        (.017)       (2.349)           N  =  106&#13;
1975-79  e      =  8.090  +  2.325 lnY  +  .230 LIT +  3.012 lnCAL    R2   = .899&#13;
(7.417)    (0.562)       (.018)       (1.452)           N  =  104&#13;
where Y = per capita CDP in 1975 U.S. dollars&#13;
LIT = percentage literate of adult population&#13;
CAL = excess of daily calorie supply per capita above 1500.&#13;
Standard errors of coefficients are shown in parentheses.&#13;
These equations appear remarkable for their similarity. Each&#13;
coefficient is in the expected positive direction and each is significant at&#13;
the .05 level in both years. There is very little change in the size of the&#13;
coefficients between the two dates. 1/ The intercept rises, but cannot itself&#13;
be directly interpreted because the zero points on lnY and InCAL are far&#13;
beyond the range of observation. If we take a prototypical poor developing&#13;
country with a Y of 300, LIT of .5, and CAL of 500, the predicted     e   in&#13;
1965-69 is 50.45 years and in 1975-79 it is 51.56 years. The "shift" for such&#13;
a country is 1.11 years, only about a third of that which would have been&#13;
expected on the basis of the pace of change in earlier periods.      Note that,&#13;
1/ Except for the intercept, the equation is also very similar to one&#13;
estimated for 1940 in Preston (1980a:306):&#13;
eo = -13.103   +   5.435 lnY  +   .165 LIT +  2.949 lnCAL        R2 =   .845&#13;
(18.510)     (2.386)       (.063)       (3.718)             N  =    36&#13;
In this equation, Y is measured in 1970 (rather than 1975) dollars, which&#13;
affects the intercept of the equation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -&#13;
since coefficients on variables change, the "shift" is not constant across&#13;
countries but depends upon their conditions. That is, it will not be&#13;
represented by the intercept alone but by the entire sets of regression&#13;
coefficients.&#13;
Similar results are found when alternate specifications and data are&#13;
used. Substituting ICP data on gross domestic product in 1970 dollars&#13;
(designated Y*) into the equations gives&#13;
1965-69  e   =  -4.466 + 4.002 lnY* + .219 LIT + 3.151 lnCAL        R2 = .920&#13;
(6.473) (0.718)       (.019)     (1.184)           N   =  106&#13;
1975-79  e     =  0.264 + 4.113 lnY* + .199 LIT + 2.621 InCAL       R2 = .911&#13;
(6.358) (0.762)       (.020)     (1.310)            N   =  104&#13;
Repeating the above exercise for our prototypical developing country with the&#13;
ICP-based regressions gives an expected eo of 48.89 in 1965-69 and 49.96 in&#13;
1975-79. The "shift" is 1.07 years. For a country with a per capita income&#13;
of $800, a literacy percentage of 75, and daily caloric availability of 2400,&#13;
the shift is (60.51 - 60.15) = 0.36 years, suggesting that the shift has been&#13;
even smaller for the better-off among LDCs.&#13;
It is interesting to note that the coefficient of Y* is about 50&#13;
percent higher than the coefficient of Y for the same period, and that more&#13;
variance is explained in regressions using Y*. Similar results are maintained&#13;
throughout the paper. An obvious explanation of this result is that the ICP&#13;
estimates of Y* contain less measurement error than the exchange rate-based&#13;
estimates of Y, since measurement error in an independent variable biases&#13;
coefficients downward. One concrete way in which this occurs is that Y*&#13;
raises income estimates for lower income countries relative to higher income&#13;
countries, thus helping to linearize the relations between eo and the log of&#13;
income. The results help to confirm widespread suspicions that Y* is&#13;
generally a superior series.&#13;

A number of equations based upon pooled data from the two periods&#13;
were estimated. Results are presented in Table 1. In equations without terms&#13;
involving interactions between time period and other covariates, the intercept&#13;
shift is .84 years when Y is used and .73 years when Y* is used (Equations 1&#13;
and 4). Both coefficients are insignificant at a 5 percent level, preventing&#13;
the rejection of the hypothesis that no across-the-board shift had occurred&#13;
between the dates. Though insignificant, however, the coefficients remain the&#13;
best estimate of the amount of across-the-board shift that occurred (note that&#13;
this estimate includes MDCs).&#13;
When an interaction term (the product of the shift dummy and Y or Y*)&#13;
is added to the equations, the coefficients of the intercept shift term&#13;
increase in size and become significant (Equations 2, 5, 6, and 7), even&#13;
though the interaction term itself is significant only in Equation 7. 1/&#13;
Evidently, the failure of the intercept shift term to be significant in&#13;
Equations 1L and 4 resulted from the fact that the shift was quite small for&#13;
the high-income MDCs. In order to illustrate the amount of shift that&#13;
occurred as a function of income level, we substitute arbitrary income values&#13;
into the equations:&#13;
1/  Interaction terms between the shift dummy and the log of Y or Y      were also&#13;
used but resulted in slightly lower R2 s and lower significance levels for&#13;
the interaction terms than interactions involving untransformed versions&#13;
of Y or Y .&#13;

Source: Compiled from Table 1.&#13;
For the range of incomes between $150 and $900, the shift is usually&#13;
estimated to be in the range of 1.0-1.5 years of life expectancy at birth&#13;
during the decade. This shift is larger than that estimated without the&#13;
interaction term, presumably because the shift was very small for the MDCs.&#13;
The pace of the shift is still only one-third to one-half of that observed&#13;
during the earlier period. The shift is estimated to be somewhat greater when&#13;
weighted regressions are used, suggesting that larger countries may have&#13;
benefited more than smaller ones from the exogenous factors.&#13;
More complex functional forms were also used to estimate the shift&#13;
factor. A logistic function fitted by unweighted maximum likelihood&#13;
procedures is&#13;
eo=           46.96  +  .2567 LIT   +  1.07 T&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 114 -&#13;
All coefficients are significant at the .05 level. The shift factor can be&#13;
estimated lby substituting values of Y and CAL into the equation. For Y = $500&#13;
and CAL = 500 (i.e., 2000 calories per day), the denominator is 1.07, so that&#13;
moving from T = 0 to T = 1 (i.e., advancing the observation from 1965-69 to&#13;
1975-79) would increase eo by 1.07/1.07 = 1 year, ceteris paribus.&#13;
Results Using the Infant Mortality Rate&#13;
Very similar results are achieved when life expectancy at birth is&#13;
replaced by the infant mortality rate. Coefficients for all regressions for&#13;
1965-69 and 1975-79 have the correct sign, although there is somewhat less&#13;
stability in coefficients than when e0   is used.  Coefficients of y* continue&#13;
to exceed in absolute value the coefficients of Y. The following are ICP-&#13;
based regression equations for the two periods:&#13;
1965-69  IMR  = 329.58 - 10.135 lnY* - 13.413 lnCAL - 1.326 LIT     R2 = .877 = 106&#13;
(39.70)  (4.403)        (7.260)       (0.114)&#13;
1975-79  IIMR  = 282.83 - 13.675 lnY* - 4.178 lnCAL - 1.268 LIT     R2 = .873 = 106&#13;
(36.75)  (4.406)       (7.573)       (0.013)&#13;
All coefficients are significant at 5 percent except those pertaining to the&#13;
calorie variable.&#13;
The variance explained by the IMR regressions is somewhat less than&#13;
that for life expectancy regressions, probably reflecting the fact that socio-&#13;
economic variables cannot capture significant determinants of infant mortality&#13;
such as breastfeeding and weaning practices nor variations in the definition&#13;
of what constitutes a live birth and or early infant death. 1/&#13;
1/ As evidence of the activity of these special factors, Coale and Demeny&#13;
(1966) find IMR to have generally the lowest correlation with other age-&#13;
specific death rates in an international collection of life tables.&#13;

The importance of breastfeeding may also explain the instability and&#13;
lack of significance of calorie availability as an influence on IMR, although&#13;
this is highly speculative.&#13;
For a country with a Y* of 300, LIT of .5, and CAL of 55, the&#13;
predicted IMR in 1965-69 is 122.1/1000 and in 1975-79 it is 115.5/1000. For a&#13;
country with Y* = 800, LIT = 75, and CAL = 900, the predicted IMR is 71.1/1000&#13;
in 1965-69 and 67.9/1000 in 1975-79. Again, the shift appears to be larger&#13;
for the poorer country. Table 2 makes this tendency more explicitly by&#13;
pooling data for the two periods and adding to the equation an intercept shift&#13;
term and an interactive term involving period and income. The intercept shift&#13;
term is insignificant in 3 of 4 regressions and the interactive term is always&#13;
insignificplt. Nevertheless, all terms have the expected sign and imply that&#13;
a shift has occurred that is larger for poorer countries:&#13;

The predicted declines of 4-9/1000 in IMR resulting from the shift in&#13;
the relationship are highly consistent with the predicted gains in e0 of 1 to&#13;
1.5 years that were described earlier.    At an e0 of 52.5-55.0, conditions&#13;
typical of LDCs during 1965-1979, a gain of one year in e0 is typically&#13;
associated with a reduction of 4.8/1000 in IMR. 1/&#13;
Discussion&#13;
We have estimated that life expectancy at birth increased by 1 to 1.5&#13;
years between 1965-69 and 1975-79 as a result of factors other than income,&#13;
literacy, and calorie availability. To narrow this range to a single average&#13;
figure, we calculate the mean of variables in 1965-69 and 1975-79. For the 84&#13;
LDCs with data on all variables for both dates, the (weighted) means are&#13;

Life expectancy at birth increased, on average, by 3.9 years. The&#13;
amount of this change attributable to the shift in the relation between eo and&#13;
other developmental indicators can be estimated by taking the mean values of&#13;
the independLent variables for 1965-69 and 1975-79 and substituting these means&#13;
into the regression equations for both years. The predicted value of life&#13;
expectancy in 1965-69 is 51.14 years and in 1975-79 is 52.23 years. Thus, the&#13;
shift in the relation accounts for 1.09 years out of the average increase of&#13;
3.9 years. The balance of 2.81 years of gain is thus attributable to improve-&#13;
ments in income, literacy, and caloric consumption.&#13;
An alternative way of calculating the shift is to use the regression&#13;
estimated for both periods combined, including a shift term and a period-&#13;
income interaction (equation 5 in Table 1). At the mean income for 1965-69&#13;
and 1975-79 of $560, the shift is 1.05 years, very similar to the above&#13;
result. However, using weighted regression (equation 7 in Table 1), the shift&#13;
factor is 1.30 years. This result again indicates that larger countries may&#13;
have benefited disproportionately from whatever factors were operating to&#13;
induce the shift.&#13;
Thus, there is good agreement among the alternate methods that the&#13;
shift factor accounted for about 1.1 to 1.3 years of gain in eo between&#13;
1965-69 and 1975-79. This is a substantial reduction from the average pace of&#13;
shift of about 3 years per decade that was recorded for earlier periods. This&#13;
picture may be altered when more data for 1975-79 and later years are added,&#13;
but there is no reason to feel that such data are more likely to increase the&#13;
estimated pace of the shift than to decrease it.&#13;
If the previously observed shift of years in eo per calendar year had&#13;
continued during the period from 1965-69 to 1975-79, then an additional annual&#13;
gain of .17 to .19 years in eo would have been registered. This would bring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119 -&#13;
the average annual gain in e0 to .39 + (.17 or .19) = .56 or .58. The gain in&#13;
eo during the period 1950-55 to 1965-69 occurred at an average rate of .58&#13;
years per calendar year. So the reduced rate of shift in the relation between&#13;
life expectancy and other development indicators seems to be exclusively&#13;
responsible for the apparent deceleration in the rate of mortality advance.&#13;
The endogenous factors seem to have been operating with much the same force as&#13;
in earlier decades.&#13;
What factors are responsible for this slowdown in the pace of&#13;
mortality decline from "exogenous" factors? Since these factors themselves&#13;
have not been identified with any precision, it is impossible to demarcate&#13;
clearly their varying roles. Of the two major factors that have been&#13;
suggested--government programs and the person-to-person diffusion of good&#13;
health knowledge and practices--the former seems more capable of abruptly&#13;
changing in intensity. As noted earlier, there is some evidence that&#13;
government programs have lagged. Part of the reason is that some of the&#13;
easier gains, especially from anti-malarial programs in Asia and Latin&#13;
America, were already registered before 1965. Malaria in Africa is a far less&#13;
tractable problem, and the rate of progress has been very slow (Molineaux&#13;
1983). International aid for health from the largest donor, USAID, has&#13;
declined considerably in real terms, partly out of fear of the population&#13;
growth consequences of continued mortality decline.&#13;
Although some of the easiest gains have already been scored, there is&#13;
no question that a battery of programmatic approaches, demonstrably successful&#13;
in carefully controlled settings, are still available for implementation. 1/&#13;
In considering ways to advance health, however, governments should not neglect&#13;
1/ The literature here is vast. For reviews, see Walsh and Warren (1979) and&#13;
Gwatkin et. al. (1980). On immunization specifically, see Foege (1983); on&#13;

the importance of "endogenous" factors. One of the striking results of this&#13;
paper, confirming earlier results at both the micro and macro levels, is the&#13;
extremely powerful role of literacy in determining a population's level of&#13;
mortality. The coefficient of literacy in life expectancy regressions is very&#13;
robust, .2, suggesting that moving from 0 to 100 percent literate would&#13;
increase eo by about 20 years, ceteris paribus; alternatively, it would reduce&#13;
the infant mortality rate by about 130/1000. Since universal literacy can be&#13;
achieved for about 1-4 percent of national income per capita (Lewis 1968), it&#13;
is clear that programs to advance education--especially, judging from micro&#13;
studies, female education--are potentially one of the most cost-effective ways&#13;
to improve mortality in developing countries, although the effects obviously&#13;
operate with a lag of, on average, about 20 years. How does this effect&#13;
compare to that of income gains per se? The use of ICP-based estimates of GDP&#13;
per capita has increased the income coefficient relative to earlier estimates,&#13;
and the new coefficients of 4-5 suggests that a 1 percent increase in GDP per&#13;
capita will raise eo by about .04 to .05 years. This still represents a&#13;
relatively small effect. If that hypothetical 1 percent gain in income were&#13;
used to increase literacy, the ultimate increase in eO is estimated to be (25&#13;
to 100) x .2 = 5 to 20 years, at least 100 times greater than the effect of&#13;
an income gain by itself. 1/ Since this literacy operates with a lag,&#13;
discounting would reduce the relative size of this gain, but the result would&#13;
still be an increase that is more than an order of magnitude greater for&#13;
literacy increase than for income growth.&#13;
1/ This calculation clearly deals with first-order effects only and neglects&#13;
the effect of literacy changes, and the investment required to achieve&#13;
them, on income and consumption streams.&#13;

            The infant mortality rate has declined
            dramatically in Peninsular Malaysia since World War II. This
            study uses individual-level retrospective data on infant
            mortality and its correlates (from the Malaysian Family Life
            Survey) to examine possible reasons for this decline. One
            important factor has been the substantial increase in
            mothers' education. Improvements in water and
            sanitation also played a role; however, the reduction in
            breastfeeding that has taken place in Malaysia has kept the
            infant mortality rate from declining as rapidly as it would
            have otherwise. This paper shows that the detrimental
            effects of reduced breastfeeding have more than offset the
            beneficial effects of improvements in water and sanitation.
            In a majority of the cases, infant mortality decline is not
            explained by changes in the variables considered here, but
            is due to factors not investigated here - most likely,
            increases in income and improvements in medical and health care.
