ABILITY IN PRE-SCHOOLERS, EARNINGS,&#13;
AND HOME-ENVIRONMENT&#13;
This paper explores on the basis of available data the role of&#13;
various family characteristics in fostering abilities in pre-school&#13;
children and the subsequent effect of ability on earnings. The paper&#13;
is part of the Bank's effort to improve the understanding of the process&#13;
of human capital development as a basic determinant of earnings. The&#13;
results suggest that household income and the status of the mother are&#13;
key predictors of abilities of pre-school children from disadvantaged&#13;
backgrounds.&#13;

PREFACE&#13;
This paper and an accompanying paper by Moshe Smilansky have&#13;
been produced as part of ongoing work in Population and Human Resources&#13;
Division of the Developmient Economics Department and the Education&#13;
Department to evaluate relative educational investment priorities with&#13;
respect to different age groups. In view of the increased priority&#13;
attached to pre-school intervention in recent years, an informal working&#13;
group within the 11orld Bank was formed to consider whether the pre-school&#13;
period deserved greater emphasis in its activities in education, nutrition,&#13;
and health. Foremost among the questions to be considered was the&#13;
relationship between the timing of the intervention on investment and&#13;
subsequent productivity.  Though little direct longitudinal evidence&#13;
could be brought to bear, the hypothesis that investments during pre-&#13;
school years generated outcomes in skills and abilities which themselves&#13;
subscquently enhanced productivity was considered worthy of investigation.&#13;
As the Batik is increasingly involved in assisting less-developed countries&#13;
restructure their educational priorities, an important question was,&#13;
simply, should maore priority be given to the education of disadvantaged&#13;
pre-school children in an effort to generate a more equitable distribution&#13;
of outcomes.&#13;
To review the evidence on pre-school intervention the Bank&#13;
invited Professor Moshe Smilansky pf Tel Aviv University to participate&#13;
in a staff seminar in November, 1975. Smilansky contended that the&#13;
results of pre-school intervention experiments and programs, at least&#13;
as measured by cognitive tests, were inconclusive at best and did not&#13;
establish a case for investments priority to the pre-school age category.&#13;
However, Smilansky noted that the more successful experiments had been&#13;
those involving the participation of parents. Extrapolating from his&#13;
experience as an educational policy-maker in lsrael, Smilansky proposed&#13;
that the need, particularly in modernizing societies, is for greater&#13;
support to the family unit. The most effective target age for such support,&#13;
he argued, was adolescence. Subsequently Mr. Smilansky was invited by&#13;
the Education Department and the Population and Human Resources Division&#13;
to prepare a paper setting out his views. Priorities in Education: Pre-&#13;
school, Evidence and Conclusions reviews in detail the evidence on U.S.&#13;
and Israeli experiments in pre-school intervention, and contains an annex&#13;
which sketches out in a preliminary fashion ways in which greater priority&#13;
to the needs o, adolescents could provide family support.&#13;
The paper bly Roger Grawe reviews the role of childhood ability&#13;
as a determinant of subsequient earnings. Grawe then develops some new&#13;
emnirica). evidence on the effects of various family characteristics in&#13;
fostering abilities in pre-school children. This research reinforces,&#13;
through a quite different methodological route, Smilansky's conclusion&#13;
that pre-school outcomes can best be enchanced by support to the existing&#13;
farmily structure; in particular, Grawe identifies the status of the mother&#13;
and income as consistent predictors of ability for children from disadvan-&#13;
taged backgrounds.&#13;
A significant litLitation to the research reviewed and reported&#13;
by Sniilansky and Grawe is its reliance on experience and data from&#13;
developed economJ.cs. This is tempered E;omewhat by the focus on disadvan-&#13;
ta-,ed rtoups withini Ohcsc oconomic.3 but goncralizations stil'l caniiot be&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
concerning the development of intelligence, and its relevance as conven--&#13;
tionally measured9 to formulate new educational priorities in developing&#13;
countries. But the weight of the evidence is now that intervention through&#13;
support of the existing family structure offers the best clhance of augmenting&#13;
the abilities of disadvantaged pre-school children and increasing the&#13;
likelihood of greater subsequent achievement.&#13;
The author would like to express their appreciation to Dov&#13;
Chernichovsky and Martha Grosse for their detailed comments and assistanice&#13;

ABILITIES IN PRE-SCHOOL CHILDREN: PRODUCTIVITY EFFECTS&#13;
AND FAMILY ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS&#13;
Summary, Conclusions and Recommendations&#13;
A primary objective of development is to raise the welfare of in-&#13;
dividuals, by increasing their economic contribution and earning power (and&#13;
likewise improving non-pecuniary outcomes). Obviously, the expansion of&#13;
income earning opportunities, by increasing the demand for entrepreneurial&#13;
and labor services through policies and projects which contribute to general&#13;
economic growth, is the primary means of tackling this objective. However,&#13;
individuals themselves have traits and characteristics which also affect&#13;
their ability to take advantage of and expand the opportunities offered in&#13;
any economic environment. In order to understand how better to increase and&#13;
broaden the distribution of welfare-generating outcomes for individuals, it&#13;
is important to know how individual traits such as schooling and ability&#13;
affect outcomes, how such traits interact, and how they may be affected by&#13;
manipulable variables (educational inputs, day care, mother and child health,&#13;
other forms of family support), and by variables endogenous to the system&#13;
(income, family structure, labor force participation).&#13;
This general formulation leads to three specific questions that&#13;
are the focus of this paper:&#13;
1. What are the characteristics of individuals that sig-&#13;
nificantly affect earnings? In particular, what is the&#13;
particular role of ability in generating economic returns?&#13;
2.  What factors influence the development of abilities in&#13;
young children?&#13;
3. What has been international experience with interven-&#13;
tion programs intended to increase the opportunities&#13;
for children with disadvantaged backgrounds by enhanc-&#13;
ing their abilities?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 &#13;
Section I, which concerns the first question, begins with a descrip-&#13;
tion of models of earnings determination and considers some of the statistical&#13;
problems that complicate empirical verification of the models. An appealing&#13;
formulation of earnings generation is a recursive model in which the different&#13;
stages of the model correspond to a life-cycle sequence. However, it is shown&#13;
that the introduction of greater complexity, for example, the reciprocal effect&#13;
of child ability on home environment, creates difficult estimation problems&#13;
in an expanded model. Nevertheless, a review of the evidence indicates that&#13;
we can identify and measure the impact of ability on earnings.&#13;
Section II expands on the particular aspect of the general model&#13;
which addresses the second question, and is the main focus of this paper.&#13;
This analysis of the first stage in the recursive earnings model, which&#13;
relates childhood abilities to family and environmental variables, begins&#13;
with a discussion of the notion of ability and its measurement. Ability&#13;
emerges as an operational concept which must be recognized as closely tied&#13;
to the specific measuring instruments0 From this perspective, focussing on&#13;
a single ability dimension, such as IQ, probably does little to facilitate a&#13;
better understanding of the issues. Utilizing data from.a sample of low&#13;
income black families in the United States, the relationship between several&#13;
different pre-school ability measures and selected family background vari-&#13;
ables is explored in some detail0 The results of this analysis show several&#13;
interesting, though tentative, conclusions. Family income plays a generally&#13;
significant, and occasionally large, role in the generation of children's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
abilities. Also important is the effect of mother's status represented&#13;
here, either singly or in combination, by marital status, mother's education&#13;
and employment. The strength of these mother's status effects on a wide&#13;
range of ability measures suggests that a development activity which en-&#13;
hances the status of women is more likely to improve the capacity and&#13;
performance of the next generation. Conversely, a development project which&#13;
has an adverse effect on the status of women is likely, ceteris paribus, to&#13;
set back the capacity of the subsequent generation. These conclusions are&#13;
offered with significant caveats: (i) they assume cross-cultural validity&#13;
between low-income US and LDC environments; (ii) the notion of status is an&#13;
intervening variable, not directly quantified, and it is, therefore, rather&#13;
difficult to predict how much status, gained or lost, would result from&#13;
specific policy measures or would lead to the postulated intergenerational&#13;
effects.&#13;
To begin Section III, some comments are offered concerning the gen-&#13;
erally negative evaluation of pre-school intervention programs. Methodologi-&#13;
cal and measurement problems are serious enough to cast into doubt broad&#13;
conclusions from most evaluation efforts thus far. Some recently available&#13;
longer term evaluations are cited as evidence that the jury must be considered&#13;
still out on the question of general success or failure of pre-school inter-&#13;
vention. In the LDC's, few countries have begun to articulate a policy of&#13;
support to young children in a family context. However, many countries do&#13;
have day care programs which could be considerably upgraded if child devel-&#13;
opment objectives were more widely recognized. A review of UNICEF and&#13;
privately assisted projects indicates some of the potential for effective&#13;
intervention in LDC's.&#13;

On the basis of the issues and evidence diccuosed in t;his pap,2ZT&#13;
the following suggestions are offered as directions for future 3ank&#13;
activity in the pre-school area:&#13;
lo  The Bank should be instrumental in undertaking apopZTiste&#13;
studies that will relate abillties to earnings Anci home&#13;
environment in LDCvs8 and thereby enhance our und2rotanding&#13;
of the process of human capital formation in thoea countries.&#13;
2. Particular consideration should be given to possible ressazch&#13;
inputs to existing pre-school projects or programs perhaps&#13;
on a collaborative basis with UNICCEFo  This could signifl&#13;
cantly increase our understanding of the offectGs f different&#13;
pre-school environments in the LDC context. A better&#13;
understanding the curriculums and institutional oettings&#13;
that seem to work for pre-school and early primary childrea&#13;
could increase the efficiency of primary education programe.&#13;
3. Any effort to monitor the effect of Bank projects on&#13;
opportunities for women should include the effects on the&#13;
envirorment of pre-school children. This T^fould provide&#13;
a basis for accumulating evidence on the need for aad feasi-&#13;
bility of specific project components designed to eubEnt&#13;
the abilities of young children.&#13;
&#13;

SECTION I - Ability as a Determinant of Earnings&#13;
This section focusses on the role of cognitive ability in earnings&#13;
determination. Although there are diverse reasons why social policy might be&#13;
directed toward augmenting individual cognitive abilities, the primary&#13;
justification considered here is the effect on the economic well-being and&#13;
earning power of individuals. 1/ On the basis of evidence from numerous&#13;
data sets to be reviewed below the following conclusions seem warranted:&#13;
1.  Developmental or recursive earnings models imply clearly that&#13;
enhancing the abilities of children will result in higher incojmes subse-&#13;
quently. However, empirical efforts to confirm or reject this hypothesis&#13;
must confront difficult problems of omitted variables, errors in variables,&#13;
and statistical identification. Nevertheless, the impact of ability on&#13;
earnings can be demonstrated statistically.&#13;
2. The size of the ability effect on earnings varies among data&#13;
sources, but ranges from small to moderate. There seems to be some evi-&#13;
dence that post-school ability has greater direct explanatory power in&#13;
earnings equations than does pre-school ability, though this is not uni-&#13;
versally true.&#13;
1/   Other reasons for advocating increased cognitive abilities tend to&#13;
parallel the external effects alleged for education, though I would&#13;
argue that augmented abilities may have even broader effects. They&#13;
relate to the technological adaptiveness of populations, and'to the&#13;
level and quality of inter-societal communication (for an economic&#13;
analysis of the importance of such communication in modern society,&#13;
see A. Hirschman, Exit, Voice and Loyalty).   Non-pecunia,ry outcomes&#13;
for individuals due to enhanced abilities (e.g., greater prbductivity&#13;
in leisure) and positive cultural effects that a family-oriented abil-&#13;
ity enhancing program might have, may be quite impo8rtantin the-&#13;
calculus of individual decision-making though quantification and&#13;
aggregation problems may reduce their appeal to the policy-maker.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3. The relationship of ability with other determinants of earnings&#13;
is complex. There seem to be significant interactions between ability and&#13;
education and between ability and experience, in their joint effect on&#13;
earnings. Investigations which have allowed non-linear ability effects have&#13;
been modestly successful.&#13;
4. There appears little doubt that childhood ability has consider-&#13;
able indirect effect on earnings through its consistently significant effect:&#13;
on schooling.&#13;
The identification of individual characteristics which significantly&#13;
affect the growth and interpersonal distribution of earnings has only become&#13;
an important focus of economic research in the past decade0 The human&#13;
capital paradigm has focused attention on a particular formulation of the&#13;
general issues, an earnings function:&#13;
lol                              E = FI(S,T)&#13;
in which individual earnings are determined by the human capital investments ,&#13;
schooling S, and other forms of training T. Ignoring for the moment specifi-&#13;
cation and estimation problems, the coefficient on S in econometric versions&#13;
of 101 can be interpreted as the rate of return to investment in education.&#13;
Early objections to this procedure emphasized the likely exaggerated effect&#13;
estimated for schooling as a result of omitting crucial correlates, particu-&#13;
larly ability, from the "independent" variables0&#13;
The time dimension over which earnings are measured also signif-&#13;
icantly influences the relative importance of individual characteristics0&#13;
Ideally the human capital earnings function should evaluate the determinants&#13;
of lifetime earnings, since different patterns of human capital investment--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
vocational education, university education, on-the-job training--give rise to&#13;
different earning-age profiles. 1/&#13;
These modifications have resulted in a modified earnings function&#13;
1.2            El= F (S,A,Z)&#13;
where lifetime earnings, E, are described as a function of schooling S,&#13;
ability A, and other factors, Z, which may include training and labor-force&#13;
experience. At this point, the pure investment analogy of human capital&#13;
breaks down, as it is clear that school and ability have their own deter-&#13;
minants which must be recognized and modeled if the earnings function is&#13;
to be correctly estimated. 2/&#13;
One model that has a considerable statistical and theoretical&#13;
appeal is a recursive system which builds on a life-cycle approach charac-&#13;
terized by the initial development of ability, followed by a period of&#13;
schooling, and finally, entry into the labor force. The three stages of&#13;
this model may be characterized as follows: 3/&#13;
1.3a           A = F (X,G)&#13;
1.3b           S = F 2(X,A)&#13;
1.3c           E = F 3(X,S,A)&#13;
1/   Some empirical implications affecting ability will be discussed below.&#13;
The importance of the earnings-age profile is emphasized in J. Mincer,&#13;
who has developed the notion of the overtaking point, which occurs&#13;
when the age earnings profiles of individuals of different schooling&#13;
cross each other. The profiles differ due to varying rates of&#13;
personal time preference. The effects of schooling on earnings are&#13;
greatest at this point.&#13;
2/   See Mark Blaug, "Human Capital Theory, A Slightly Jaundiced Survey,"&#13;
Journal of Economic Literature, September 1976, for a discussion of the&#13;
"investment" model in this context.&#13;
3/   Path coefficient models (notably, 0. Duncan, "Ability and Achievement,"&#13;
Eugenics Quarterly, 1968) are necessarily based on a similar recursive&#13;
system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
where&#13;
A represents early childhood ability&#13;
Ss schooling and post-school formal training&#13;
E9 some measure of lifetim2 earnings&#13;
X, a set of family background characteristics&#13;
G9 genetic endowment.&#13;
As a structural models, these relationships capture some important features&#13;
of reality9 namely that there are distinct developmental stages each focussed&#13;
on different outcomes which precede chronologically the earnings function.&#13;
Of course the underlying causal basis of this recursive model is found in&#13;
the exogenous variables, X and G, of the first equation. The creation of&#13;
abilities and schooling outcomes are represented only as important processes&#13;
through which genetic and early environmental characteristics ultimately&#13;
influence earnings and productivity. In this respect this recursive model&#13;
presents an extreme case; but its structure offers a useful perspective&#13;
from which to evaluate the empirical work in this area.&#13;
An important implication of the recursive framework is that&#13;
each of the equations can be estimated singly by ordinary least squares&#13;
techniques and still yield best, unbiased estimates of the coefficients.&#13;
In the earnings equation, this has meant that the inclusion of an ability&#13;
measure has been widely interpreted as allowing the estimation of an unbiased&#13;
rate of return to education, so that several data sets which include an&#13;
ability measure have been developed. In a recent review of this literature,&#13;
A. Leibowitz has presented the salient features of those investigations which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
included one or more of the relationships in the recursive model. 1/ This&#13;
information is reproduced here as Table 1. The variety of data sets and&#13;
estimation techniques represented in these studies has resulted in a rather&#13;
heterogenous pattern of results. Of the nine studies reported which include&#13;
an ability measure, seven find it to be significant predictor of income and&#13;
the other two find its effects confined to schooling. In all reported studies&#13;
which investigated schooling attainments, ability figured as a significant&#13;
determinant. It is important to emphasize that this effect is independent of&#13;
family background; furthermore only a few of these studies distinguish pre-&#13;
school ability from post- or mid-school measures.&#13;
If, as discussed above, ability is viewed as a developmental&#13;
concept, then ability and education might be expected to have interactive&#13;
effects; however, ordinary least squares estimation of the simple recursive&#13;
model assumes linear independence and additivity between the incremental&#13;
effects of education and ability. More important the recursive formulation&#13;
does not permit any feedback of schooling on ability, though such feedback&#13;
is a clear implication of the developmental approach to ability generation.&#13;
In more formal terms, assume for the moment that schooling and ability are&#13;
considered to be proxies for an unobserved variable "productive capacity,"&#13;
P, so that 1.3c becomes, E = F (P,X). Only if this relation is itself&#13;
linear, i.e.,&#13;
1.4            P = a A + a S&#13;

will the linear form of the recursive system (1.3) adequately account for the&#13;
education-ability interaction. 1/&#13;
Recognizing that pre- and post-school abilities may vary, captures&#13;
one aspect of this interaction.    For example, let A1 and A2 refer to pre- and&#13;
post-school abilities respectively, and consider the model:&#13;
1.5             A  = g1(X,G)&#13;
1.5b            S  = g2(X,A1)&#13;
1.5c            A2 = g3(A1,S)&#13;
1.5d            E  = g4(A 29S,X)&#13;
If this model correctly described reality but were specified incorrectly by&#13;
an econometric version of the simple recursive model (equations, 1.3, above)&#13;
it can be readily demonstrated that the estimated effect of schooling would&#13;
reflect the product of the marginal effect of post-school ability on earnings&#13;
and of schooling on post-school ability, while the real effects of schooling&#13;
1/   F. Welch, op. cit. demonstrates that with such a linear specification&#13;
and plausible parameter estimates for the first order partial correla-&#13;
tion coefficients r      and r      result in an interpretation of the&#13;
schooling coefficient not as a rate of return but as itself a much&#13;
better estimate of the incremental importance of "true" ability or-&#13;
productive capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
and post-school ability on earnings would be weighted components of the&#13;
estimated coefficient on pre-school ability. 1/&#13;
An alternative form of 15d still consistent with a recursive for-&#13;
mulation is&#13;
1.6             E = g'(X,AlDS,A)&#13;
An appealing transformation of this general form would be&#13;
101             E =h 1 (1A)h 2(X9A 2S)&#13;
in which early childhood abilities could have the effect of an efficiency&#13;
parameter augmenting the effects of schooling, post-school abilities, and&#13;
other background factors. This particular version of the earnings function&#13;
might be particularly appropriate if A1 were considered to be a vector of&#13;
pre-school outcomes which could not be subsequently made up. This might&#13;
1/   Consider economic formulations of 13 and 1l5:&#13;
lo3a'          A   = a  X + a2 G + U1&#13;
103bW           S  = a 21X + a22A + U2&#13;
13c'           E  =a31X +a32 S     + a33A  3&#13;
1.5a'          A1 =b 1X +b12G + eI&#13;
1.5b'           S  =b21 +b22AI + e2&#13;
15c'           A2 =b31S S+b32 A     e3&#13;
1.5d0           E  =b41X +b42 S + b 43A 2+ e4&#13;
Suppose that 1.3c' is estimated even though model 105 better reflects&#13;
reality. In this case substitution illustrates that the esti-&#13;
mated coefficients a32 and a33 will actually equal&#13;
a32  b43    31&#13;
a33 -b42b22 + b43b32&#13;
Model 13 in effect, a semi-reduced form version of the structural&#13;
model, 105; as such it must be recognized that the coefficients have&#13;
no direct interpretation.&#13;

be particularly appropriate for children in multiply disadvantaged envi-&#13;
ronments, in which brain development might be permanently set back through&#13;
malnutrition or mental growth inhibited through the lack of environmental&#13;
stimulation at appropriate times in terms of brain development. 1/ In such&#13;
cases the function, h1, might be of the form,&#13;
hI(A1) = (1,0)&#13;
where Q &lt; 1 obtains only in the case of compounded or severe deprivatsions. In&#13;
the normal case, the effects of early childhood ability work themselves out&#13;
indirectly through earlier stages in the recursive framework (i.e., h1(A1)     1).&#13;
The formulation of 1.7 is merely one specification of many in which interac-&#13;
tions between ability and other variables contribute to economic performance;&#13;
but it does summarize usefully the developmental plausibility of these sorts&#13;
of interactions.&#13;
Turning again to the empirical studies summarized in Table 1, one&#13;
notes that few have had the required data or were organized so as to explore&#13;
fully the types of interactions that might be expected. In general the&#13;
inclusion of ability measures in earnings functions has been found to reduce&#13;
schooling coefficients in the range of 4 to 35% with a central tendency&#13;
around 10%. 2/ Post-school ability measures seem to be associated on average&#13;
1/   Herman Epstein, a physiological psychologist at Brandeis University, has&#13;
presented some very suggestive evidence on these points in an informal&#13;
seminar at the World Bank. His research indicates the existence of devel-&#13;
opmentally significant growth spurts in brain size which seem to be highly&#13;
correlated with mental growth. These spurts occur at approximately two-&#13;
year intervals until adulthood; but deficits caused by early childhood&#13;
malnutrition do not appear to be made up subsequently.&#13;
2/   H. Gintis, "Education, Technology and the Characteristics of Worker Pro-&#13;
ductivity," American Economic Review, 61 (May, 1971), reviews nine studies&#13;
which yield results within these bounds. Subsequent studies seem to&#13;
narrow this range: Griliches and Mason (7-10%), Taubman and Wales (9%).&#13;
Negligible effects of pre-school ability on the education-income rela-&#13;
tionship were found by both Conlisk and Leibowitz, however.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16 -&#13;
with larger reductions in the schooling coefficient, between 15 and 20%,&#13;
providing some indirect evidence for the specification of a development,al&#13;
theory in which abilities at different stages are treated differently. 1/&#13;
Explicit evidence of interaction effects between education, expe-&#13;
rience, and ability is provided by J0 Hause in a reanalysis of several data&#13;
sets stratified by labor force experience and educational level.&#13;
The data 0o0 imply that measures of cognitive ability are&#13;
associated with an empirically significant but modest in-&#13;
crease in annual earnings for those with high levels of&#13;
schooling 000 In the United States samples, there appears&#13;
to be a distinct tendency for the ability coefficient to&#13;
increase with labor force experience. 2/&#13;
In the four data sets reanalyzed by Hause the ability coefficients at the&#13;
highest educational levels (either one or more college degrees) range from&#13;
1.65 to 7.7 times as great as the ability coefficients on the lowest educa-&#13;
tion levels (high school dropouts) with the variation in the range related&#13;
to both the type of ability measure and the age of the cohort. The greater&#13;
the age (experience) the larger the ability coefficients in all educational&#13;
strata; but those in the highest educational levels increased relatively&#13;
moreo An interesting dimension of Hause's results that he does not elaborate&#13;
1/   Griliches and Mason established a post-school reduction in the school-&#13;
ing coefficient of 13-17%o Hanushek in a study not reported in Table 1&#13;
("Teacher Characteristics and Gains in Student Achievement: Estimation&#13;
Using Micro Data," American Economic Review, 61 (May 1971)), found a&#13;
bias of 15% in the schooling coefficient on earnings when post-school&#13;
ability was uncontrolled0 Taubman and Wales' data and estimation tech-&#13;
niques yield a range between 10% and 19%.&#13;
2/   J. Hause, "Ability and Schooling as Determinants of Lifetime Earnings,"&#13;
in F0 Juster, ed0, Education, Income and Human Behavior, Carnegie Foun-&#13;
dation For the Advancement of Teaching and National Bureau of Economic&#13;
Research, 1975.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
is the tendency for ability coefficients for both high-school and college&#13;
dropouts to be significantly lower than for those for high-school and college&#13;
graduates. This presumably indicates the interaction of ability with some&#13;
sort of motivational factor. In terms of the model suggested in 1.7 this&#13;
motivational dimension may figure as a component of the background factors,&#13;
X; or it may be that the ability outcomes themselves include non-cognitive&#13;
components.&#13;
Further evidence on interaction is provided in another data set&#13;
(the National Bureau of Economic Research--Thorndike data) extensively&#13;
analyzed by P. Taubman. 1/ Ability tests were administered during World War&#13;
II as part of the qualifying process for pilot selection in the Air Force.&#13;
Earnings profiles were subsequently obtained in 1955 and again 1969. Taubman&#13;
finds strong ability effects: the increment to earnings in both years as-&#13;
sociated with the difference between the top and bottom fifths in the abil-&#13;
ity distribution exceeds the earnings increment associated with a bachelor's&#13;
degree. 2/ Taubman tested for interactions in the most general functional&#13;
form by computing separate earnings equations for each ability fifth. He&#13;
concludes "using analysis of covariance, we could not reject the hypothesis&#13;
that the effects of all variables including education, were independent of&#13;
\&#13;
1/   P. Taubman, Sources of Inequality in Earnings, North Holland Publish-&#13;
ing Co., Ltd.; Amsterdam, Oxford; 1976.&#13;
2/   Taubman uses ability fifths from one factor of the raw scores as his&#13;
ability measure. As the test population had already scored above the&#13;
median on a general intelligence test, Taubman notes that his fifths&#13;
correspond more closely to tenths in the general population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
the level of ability in each year0" I/ However, Taubman does find signifi-&#13;
cant differentials between the bottom ability fifth and the top four fifths&#13;
with successively greater effects even within the top four fifths. Thiese&#13;
non-linear effects of ability are more pronounced in 1969 than in 1955, and&#13;
supplement across-the-board increase in ability effects in the later year0&#13;
One may conclude from Taubman's empirical analysis that ability interacts&#13;
non-linearly with age or experience in affecting earnings (though, at 'Least&#13;
as measured in the NBER--Thorndike data, ability does not interact with&#13;
education and other determinants of earnings).&#13;
Finally, Leibowitz reports two additional pieces of evidence on&#13;
ability interactions. One, an extensive study by Sewell and Hauser, 2/&#13;
analyzes an early career profile of earnings in a large sample of the cohort&#13;
of 1957 high school seniors in Wisconsin. Both ability-education and abilityÂ°&#13;
experience interactions were well documented0 The second is the Swedish study&#13;
by de Wolfff and Van Slipje who "found that intelligence and social clatss&#13;
reinforce each other in generating earnings, and their combined effect,&#13;
particularly at high levels of education, is much greater than implied by an&#13;
additivity of effect0" 3/ The Swedish data on social class and ability were&#13;
1/   Taubman, gop cit., po 34. Note that this finding does not preclucle&#13;
that a continuous scaling of ability with the stronger assumption of a&#13;
functional form such as 3.3 might not yield significant interactions&#13;
coefficients0 Furthermore, Taubman's ability is a post-schooling&#13;
measure which might itself be thought of as the outcome of a school-&#13;
ing--pre-school interaction0 Under this interpretation, the inde--&#13;
pendence of education and ability lends some support to the Gintis-&#13;
Bowles hypothesis on education as a proxy for non-cognitive outcomes&#13;
(cf. S0 Bolwes, H0 Gintis, and J. Simmons)&#13;

collected in 1938 and income, 25 years later in 1963. One might rationalize&#13;
ex-post that the behavioral correlates of social class would have been much&#13;
more homogenously grouped in Sweden of 1938 than today; also an investigation&#13;
of ability-education interactions stratified by SES levels would have been&#13;
informative.&#13;
Another important' aspect of the relationship between ability and&#13;
earnings is the indirect effect through the influence of ability on 5chooling.&#13;
In terms of the evidence presented in Table 1, all of the studies which had&#13;
a direct ability measure among the determinants of schooling found the rela-&#13;
tionship to be significant. 1/ It is also generally true that the variance&#13;
explained in the schooling relationships is greater than in the earnings&#13;
function, so that the indirect effects of ability may often exceed the direct&#13;
effects in actual dollar impact on earnings (this obviously depends specifi-&#13;
cally on the relative sizes of the various coefficients involved; but, in&#13;
general, the effects of ability on schooling and schooling on earnings are&#13;
both rather large while the direct effect of ability on earnings though&#13;
often sigificant is not usually large).&#13;
Some of the problems in sorting out the effects of schooling and&#13;
ability have already been mentioned above. These became further compounded&#13;
as one takes a more generalized view of schooling and ability outcomes. If&#13;
abilities are defined to include non-cognitive outcomes as well as a broad&#13;
range of cognitive skills, and schooling outcomes consist of learned knowledge&#13;
1/   The single exception, the study by Chamberlain and Griliches, infers&#13;
an ability measure from a components of variance model estimated on a&#13;
sample of brothers. Whatever skills are represented by this ability&#13;
measure are a significant determinant of adult earnings and occupation&#13;
but not schooling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
as well as work habits, attitudes, etc.D then a system with feedback is&#13;
needed to portray the types of interaction that presumably occur:&#13;
108a           A  = hI(X 'S G)&#13;
108b           S - h2(X   A)&#13;
18c           Et   h3(At St 9)&#13;
where the subscript t refers to time. In this variant schooling and ability&#13;
interact as determinants of each other at any given point in time. Onc:e the&#13;
interaction is admitted the practical benefits of the recursive system are&#13;
lost and it is no longer possible to estimate unique coefficients for the&#13;
variables in the various equations. In terms of an econometric models, only&#13;
the schooling relationship can be estimated without further restrictior..s&#13;
Neither the ability nor the earnings equations can be identified. This&#13;
raises serious doubts about the consistency of single equation estimates of&#13;
the earnings function (108c) which do not explicitly deal with the econo=&#13;
metric effect of the schooling-ability model.&#13;
Alternatively one may specify a model which combines the simulta-&#13;
neity features of "l.8" and distinguishes preÂ° and post-school ability as&#13;
"105" above. In this case the pre-school ability equation can be identi-&#13;
fied and estimated with standard techniques even though the simultaneity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
difficulties remain in the the rest of the model. 1/ The next section of this&#13;
paper deals specifically with the determinants of pre-school ability. 2/&#13;
1/   This model may be specified as follows:&#13;
1.8a'          A'=h        G&#13;
1   h    1(Xt')&#13;
l.8a           A   = h (X 'S   t)&#13;
1.8b           St = h 3(Xt ,At)&#13;
1.8c           Et = h4(Xt At' t&#13;
In this formulation the pre-school ability equation combines the struc-&#13;
tural and reduced forms and can be estimated using standard regression&#13;
techniques. It should be noted that were adequate longitudinal data&#13;
available, the inclusion of "previous period" ability and schooling&#13;
outcomes in the ability and schooling equations would result in an&#13;
indentifiable structure.&#13;
2/   Of course\, the ability-earnings relationship is not even a necessary&#13;
condition for policies to augment the abilities of young children if&#13;
other than economic goals are considered as policy objectives. In&#13;
Tanzania and Peru, for example, day care programs for young children&#13;
are justified as an important element in the restructuring of rural&#13;
society: this as much for their role in socializing future adults as&#13;
for their cognitive value (though the latter is more explicitly recog-&#13;
nized in Peru). Or intervention may be reasonable widespread as in&#13;
the provision of day care in Kenya but remain a privately demanded and&#13;
supplied service with little government direction or support.&#13;

SECTION II - Family-related Determinants of Ability in Young Children&#13;
In Section I a general model of the development of individual&#13;
economic performance was developed in which ability plays an importani: role&#13;
first as an outcome in its own right and then as an important determinant of&#13;
schooling and earnings. In the present section, attention is focussed on&#13;
*the determinants of ability and, in particular, of pre-school ability. The&#13;
general model for the discussion is&#13;
2.1            At = F(X itG)&#13;
where At represents a vector of ability outcomes at time t, Xit9 a set: of&#13;
i environmental characteristics, and G, genetic endowment0 The discussion&#13;
will first take up some issues in the definition and measurement of ability0&#13;
A brief discussion of heritability will follow. The main part of the&#13;
section will present and evaluate empirical evidence on the environmenltal&#13;
determinants of ability0&#13;
The Measurement and Meaning of Abilit&#13;
Ability is an operational concept: in the context of the present&#13;
model, ability is the intervening variable that relates a set of famil.y&#13;
background characteristics to subsequent individual performance in school and&#13;
work0 The practical validity of this concept depends crucially on the speci-&#13;
fic instrument that is to measure ability0 Traditionally cognitive ability&#13;
measures were designed to predict school performance, usually within Et short&#13;
to medium time horizon0   The instruments that were to be designed for this&#13;
objective were selected on certain characteristics. As school performance is,&#13;
by design, a relative concept with a near normal distribution, the sta.ndard&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
w 23 -&#13;
cognitive ability measure should generate over similar populations a similarly&#13;
normal distribution. Furthermore as school performance does not, on average,&#13;
fluctuate dramatically from year to year, a predictive measure was desired&#13;
which demonstrated similar stability. Finis Welch has pointed out that these&#13;
objectives will logically result in the development of ability measures which&#13;
are heavily influenced by the more stable set of underlying factors, such as&#13;
home environment. 1/ Furthermore a test which reflects predominantly charac-&#13;
teristics of middle-class home environment will also tend to the desired&#13;
normal distribution. It is natural then that IQ tests will tend to be less&#13;
reliable over longer periods of time as the background characteristics them-&#13;
selves will tend to vary more. The phenomenon reported by Bloom in Stability&#13;
and Change in Human Characteristics, namely that "in terms of intelligence&#13;
measured at age 17, at least 20% is developed by age 1, 50% by age 4, 80% by&#13;
about age 8, and 92% by age 13," 2/ is attributable to (i) the increasing&#13;
sensitivity of the intelligence test to the more stable elements in the&#13;
background of the individual, and (ii) to the increased probability of stabil-&#13;
ity in the determinants of test response. The latter is itself due to simply&#13;
the shorter span of years involved and the resulting lower likelihood of&#13;
significant changes in the environmental determinants of ability and, I would&#13;
speculate, to the increasing feedback effect of the individual on his own&#13;
environment, thereby increasing the stability of that environment.&#13;
1/   F. Welch, "Relationships between Income and Schooling" in Review of&#13;
Research in Education, 2.&#13;
2/   This statement forms the basis for an illuminating discussion by&#13;
M. Selowsky, "A Note on Pre-School Age Investment in Human Capital&#13;
in Developing Countries," in Economic Development and Cultural Change,&#13;
Vol. 24, No. 4, July 1976.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24 &#13;
In the following discussion, the term ability will refer to a&#13;
variety of specific instruments, though most are variants of "IQO" Each of&#13;
these tests was designed for a specific evaluation or predictive purpose&#13;
which was not directly related to the general earnings model. In the case&#13;
of cognitive measures, such as IQ, we know that they do relate to subsequent&#13;
outcomes, particularly school performance, but also earnings. In the case&#13;
of non-cognitive, or affective, measures, the primary objecives of the tests&#13;
have been short-term evaluations for counseling purposes. Given such objec-&#13;
tives it is not surprising that affective tests have shown little stability&#13;
in the context of long-term models0 Few would dispute that affective tra:Lts&#13;
play a crucial role in determining economic performance, but little progress&#13;
has been made in devising the measures with which such traits could be iden-&#13;
tified. In the empirical treatment of outcomes for pre-school children to b-&#13;
presented below, affective outcomes will be used to supplement informatiorL on&#13;
cognitive outcomes.&#13;
One disclaimer to this discussion of ability measure should be&#13;
noted0 This review, and the subsequent discussion of empirical results do&#13;
not discuss the issues posed by the ongoing but seemingly sterile debate on&#13;
the heritability of IQ0 There now exists a comprehensive literature on this&#13;
matter which has demonstrated conclusively the inadequacy of the data (some&#13;
of which has now been shown to have been fabricated), and of the statistical&#13;
procedures that have been utilized to demonstrate heritability coefficients0 1/&#13;
Even more to the point is the fact that heritability estimates of any trait&#13;
1/   See L. Kamin, The Science and Politics of IQ, Halstead Press, iea Yorlc,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

are population specific. Such estimates do not establish relative herita-&#13;
bility characteristics between distinct genetic pools; nor do they establish&#13;
anything concerning the relative heritability of traits within populations&#13;
having quite different environmental characteristics. As the objective of&#13;
this exercise is to identify policy issues which may relate to the pre-school&#13;
populations of disadvantaged groups in developing countries, the heritability&#13;
of IQ within samples of relatively affluent American and British populations&#13;
can only establish an upper bound which is likely to be of little relevance&#13;
in rapidly changing LDC environments. The dominance of gross changes in&#13;
environment over heritability has been effectively demonstrated in the case&#13;
of anthropometric measures such as weight and height. 1/ However, in the&#13;
discussion of empirical results it must be borne in mind that without an&#13;
explicit control for the genetic component of the ability measures, the&#13;
coefficients on other determinants will be biased to the extent they are&#13;
correlated with genetic factors.&#13;
The empirical results of this section focus on the determinants&#13;
of abilities in children, particularly pre-school children. Three such&#13;
studies are summarized in Table 2. What conclusions may be drawn from&#13;
these investigations?&#13;
1. The first and most basic point is that systematic&#13;
effects of family characteristics occur both in&#13;
samples that range widely over socio-economic&#13;
strata and in a sample that is confined to poor&#13;
and lower middle-income blacks. In particular&#13;
mother's education and family demographic char-&#13;
acteristics appear as significant,determinants.&#13;
2. New information emerges from these studies on the&#13;
relation of mother's education to other significant&#13;

determinants. From the Leibowitz data9 there appear to&#13;
be strong indications that mother's education matters&#13;
because of the activities that educated mothers undertake&#13;
with their children (reading9 not watching TV, etc.). The&#13;
Gary Income Maintenance data broaden the picture to include&#13;
factors other than education which may serve to increase&#13;
the status of the mother, such as heading the household and&#13;
participating in the labor force. Each of these factors was&#13;
found to contribute to specific types of childhood abilities,&#13;
giving a somewhat broader picture of the importance of the&#13;
mother-child relationship.&#13;
3. Controlling for the status variables, one may generalize&#13;
that income has a significant impact on abilities in a&#13;
sample of predominantly low income black American children.&#13;
There is some reason to believe that for some abilities&#13;
(including both cognitive and affective traits) the signifi--&#13;
cance of income or changes in income dominates the effect olf&#13;
mother's education at least within the ranges of income less&#13;
than $159000 a year and education of high school or less as&#13;
covered by the Gary sample. There is some evidence that income&#13;
plays a more significant role in families in which the mother&#13;
is less well-educated0&#13;
4.  Demographic effects are mixed:   there does seem to be a&#13;
general detrimental effect on abilities from close child-&#13;
spacing, particularly in two-parent families or families&#13;
having a relatively more educated mother0 There does not,&#13;
however, appear to be a consistent pattern to the effects&#13;
of birth order0 In the Leibowitz sample, family size&#13;
does consistently have the predicted negative effects on&#13;
ability0 The fact that this is not the case in the Gary&#13;
sample suggests that family size effects might be related&#13;
to broader socio-economic distinctions0 Child-specific&#13;
variables (birth order, spacing, age) do interact with&#13;
mother's education and family status. Thus test scores&#13;
standardized by age, for example, may fail to reflect&#13;
accurately environmental influences.&#13;
5.  Finally, the Taubman post-high-school data suggest, through&#13;
the significance of the general "background" variable,&#13;
important feedback effects of schooling on ability con-&#13;
firming the simultaneity problems discussed in Section I.&#13;
The Taubman data also indicate the importance of socio-&#13;
logical and motivational factors though the direction of&#13;
causality for the latter is far from clear.&#13;
The following discussion will summarize the most important results&#13;
across the various ability measures first in the Taubman and Leibowitz&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
studies and then in the Gary sample, leaving a detailed description of the&#13;
outcome measures and the specific explanatory variables and a test-by-test&#13;
discussion of results to the Appendix.&#13;
In a study that involved mid-school (as opposed to pre-school)&#13;
abilities, Taubman estimated a variant of the ability function 2.1. The&#13;
ability measure was a post high school qualifying test given to candidates&#13;
for pilot training during World War II. Of the many sub-tests, Taubman&#13;
constructed a scaled score predominantly reflecting skills in numerical&#13;
operations, mathematics, and reading. Although the sample size allowed quite&#13;
detailed estimation using nearly fifty independent variables, the explained&#13;
variance in the ability scores barely exceeded 8%. Taubman's results indi-&#13;
cate strong effects of parental education; but a single interpretation does&#13;
not readily follow as there is no family income variable among the background&#13;
measures. The effects of parental education may be interpreted as reflect-&#13;
ing (i) the genetic endowment of the parent, (ii) actual earnings, or (iii)&#13;
non-income related and otherwise unmeasured aspects of the home environment.&#13;
On the basis of the low labor force participation rates reported for mothers&#13;
in his sample, Taubman argues for an interpretation based on (i) and (iii);&#13;
but this reasoning cannot exclude a family income-related interpretation&#13;
as assortive mating could lead directly to the interaction of (unmeasured)&#13;
family income and mother's education.&#13;
A. Leibowitz has analyzed a set of data for which the ability mea-&#13;
sure relates to the pre-school period. Using scores on the Peabody Picture&#13;
Vocabulary Test as the outcome measure, At, she estimates the effect of a&#13;
reasonably rich set of home environment variables.   In particular she finds&#13;
significant effects from family size, mother's education, the presence of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

labor-saving consumer durables (dryer and dishwasher)1, the presence of an&#13;
encyclopedia, and joint mother-child activities,, such as readingo However,&#13;
the work status of neither the mother nor father was found to have a sig-&#13;
nificant effect on pre-school verbal ability, nor did the presence of con-&#13;
sumption-oriented durable goods (TV, HiFi)1, nor attendance at day care,&#13;
Head Start, or kindergarten. Children of mothers who watched TV regularly&#13;
when the child was present did score significantly lower0&#13;
The data analyzed by Leibowitz allowed a breakdown into urban,&#13;
suburban, and rural subsamples. Among the urban families1, the effect of&#13;
mother's education was considerably weaker, as were the various activity&#13;
effectso However1, the presence of labor-saving or education-related goods&#13;
had considerably greater effects0 In contrast, only the reading activity&#13;
variable was estimated to have a significant effect among suburban families;&#13;
while in the rural sample,, mother0s labor force participation had a strong&#13;
negative effect (which, however, was halved by accounting for TV watching)0&#13;
Family size was not related to the ability measure in either the suburban&#13;
or rural samples0 These differential effects seem to illustrate that the&#13;
specific activities which mothers engage in affect the human capital acqui-&#13;
sition of their children as much or more than gross measures of socio-eco-&#13;
nomic status or time spent with children0&#13;
The most important class of variables that emerge from analysis&#13;
of the Gary Income Naintenance data concerns the effect of mother's status&#13;
on child performance. Nother's status in the context of these families&#13;
is reflected in education, heading the household, and participatirig in&#13;
the labor forceo The effects of thib class of variables is strongest on&#13;
visual-motor skills as measured by the Seguin Form Board and the Block&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Design sub-test of the Wechsler Primary and Pre-school Scale of Intelligence.&#13;
Since a major developmental focus of the pre-school period is physiological&#13;
maturation, the coordination of motor skills with cognitive ability assumes&#13;
considerable importance (arguably greater than pure cognitive effects). The&#13;
interaction of mother's status with other variables indicates more how the&#13;
status variables operate. This analysis suggests a degree of substitutabil-&#13;
ity between mother's education and single parenthood in their effects and&#13;
ability whereas labor force participation and single-parenthood (synonymous&#13;
with female headed households in this sample) appear to have complementary&#13;
effects. 1/ There is also some indication in the covariance analysis that&#13;
earned income and regular employment may substitute for mother's education.&#13;
On a limited scope of outcomes, it appears that labor force participation&#13;
among less educated mothers hinders performance. In the affective domain,&#13;
the major differential effect is that of labor force participation in fe-&#13;
male-headed households--a result consistent with the importance attached&#13;
here to the status of the mother. There is some indication that child-spe-&#13;
cific characteristics as age, birth order, and spacing lose their normal&#13;
importance as ability determinants in female-headed households.&#13;
The second major category of variables which were included in&#13;
the investigation of the Gary data were income-related. In the context of&#13;
the income maintenance experiment it was possible to distinguish between&#13;
sources of income (earned, unearned, experimental transfer payments) 2/ and&#13;
1/   In the case of two sub-tests on the IQ measure some puzzling reversals&#13;
of the general propositions on mother's status occurred. Single parent-&#13;
hood was found to enhance the effect of the better-educated mother.&#13;
2/   Unearned income generally consisted of governmental transfer payments&#13;
other than the experimental payments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
to specify changes in average monthly income between the two years during&#13;
which the study was conducted. Also related to this category were measures&#13;
of the frequency and duration of employment.&#13;
In general, earned income significantly affects a broader range of&#13;
abilities than income from other sources. In particular, higher levels of&#13;
earned income enhance the performance of children on the visual-motor sk1ills&#13;
and on cognitive measures which have a significant informational component.&#13;
In the case of the latter measures there does seem to be a significant&#13;
topping-off effect to earned income, with the overall income effect negative&#13;
at very high levels (relative, of course, to the sample mean)0 1/ Increases&#13;
in earned income have consistently positive effects over the all IQ sub-tests&#13;
that were used in the sample as well as on a "self-concept"' measure. The&#13;
effects of increments in earned income are significant but much weaker in&#13;
the case of visual-motor skills. The policy significance of direct income&#13;
effects in this sample of low income urban blacks is great, for it indicates&#13;
that within a disadvantaged socio-economic stratum, controlling for education&#13;
and family structure, better performance in the economic system generates&#13;
better outcomes for young children.&#13;
The results presented here do not allow a precise specification of&#13;
the means by which income affects performance; the major alternative inter-&#13;
pretations would seem to be related to (i) increased allocation of goods&#13;
1/   This effect can best be interpreted as sample-specific, i.eo within&#13;
the restricted range of income-earning opportunities available to&#13;
families in the Gary sample, those at the high range had made in some&#13;
sense, extraordinary efforts with sacrifices in other dimensions in&#13;
order to attain incomes which for the population as a whole would not&#13;
be considered high.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
to young children or simply the presence of a materially more stimulating&#13;
environment, (ii) a more achievement-oriented environment, stemming from&#13;
the greater motivation of the income earner, (iii) the greater security&#13;
and stability implicit in a wage-earning environment, though this effect&#13;
should be controlled by the labor force participation status of the household,&#13;
or (iv) residual effects of genetic endowment, parental intelligence, not&#13;
captured elsewhere (in a sample for whom educational opportunities may have&#13;
been arbitrarily limited, these effects may be plausibly proxied, at least in&#13;
part, by income).&#13;
Earned income also interacts systematically with other determinants&#13;
of ability. In particular, there is evidence from several ability measures&#13;
that earned income effects are greater for children with less educated&#13;
mothers. This lends support to the productivity rationale for income effects&#13;
or suggests that whatever income buys may act as a substitute for mother's&#13;
education. In one case, income effects are stronger among children who&#13;
respond more readily to the test situation. 1/ This sort of interaction&#13;
is indicative of the basic identification problems that result from the&#13;
feedback between the child's own development and the environment that further&#13;
stimulates that development. The interaction between single-parenthood and&#13;
earned income is inconclusive. On some outcome measures performance is sig-&#13;
nificantly reduced by increases in earned income in female-headed families&#13;
while on other measures income has positive effects.&#13;
1/   In all the various tests of pre-school children in the Gary sample, a&#13;
minority of 10-15% refused to respond at all to the test. This state-&#13;
ment is based on separate regressions which were computed for the sub-&#13;
group of responders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
The role of unearned income and experimental transfer payments is&#13;
much spottier. In the few cases in which experimental payments emerge as&#13;
significant determinants they seem to behave in a complementary fashion to&#13;
earned income and in the direction opposite to other unearned income. The&#13;
implications of this are provocative in the context of redistributive policy;&#13;
but the actual results are too thin to support more than speculation. The&#13;
major implication relevant to LDCs is the importance of earned versus&#13;
unearned income.&#13;
A final set of explanatory factors that bear importantly on child-&#13;
hood ability includes demographic factors such as birth order and child&#13;
spacing0 1/ Within the rather narrowly defined socio-economic group that&#13;
constitutes the Gary Income Maintenance sample, there emerge few consistent&#13;
patterns to demographic effects across tests0 This heterogeneity seemE&#13;
mainly due to differential demographic effects within different family types&#13;
or different education strata0&#13;
The negative effects of birth order on performance were, with one&#13;
notable exception, concentrated in two-parent families0 The magnitude of&#13;
significant birth-order effects was not exceedingly large, however: the&#13;
differential due to a single position later in the sibling order varied from&#13;
the equivalent of three to seven months in maturation0 In some cases a sig-&#13;
nificant, positive birth order effect occurred within single-parent families&#13;
indicating, perhaps, some substitution of older siblings for the second&#13;
parent in fostering certain skills (visual/motor skills in particular)0 In&#13;
1/   In the Gary sample, preliminary investigations determined that the&#13;
number of children in the family had no explanatory power, except&#13;
as a proxy for birth-order0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
all sub-scales of the WPPSI-IQ test the positive effects of birth order within&#13;
the sub-group having high-school or better educated mothers dominated the&#13;
full sample. One can only speculate as to why this effect should occur in&#13;
the restricted domain of the IQ tests. A plausible but by no means certain&#13;
explanation is that older children attending school particularly enhance the&#13;
abilities of younger siblings in families which value and support education&#13;
as proxied by the mother's education.&#13;
The second demographic dimension that is investigated in some&#13;
detail in the Gary sample is the effect of close child-spacing. On balance,&#13;
a narrow gap between the subject child and his next oldest sibling retarded&#13;
performance; if the gap were less than one year the decline in performance&#13;
was often substantial, exceeding a standard deviation for some subgroups.&#13;
These effects are again most consistent on the WPPSI-IQ measure for children&#13;
whose mothers attained at least a high school education. This is at least&#13;
consistent with the rationale offered above for the positive birth order&#13;
effects in such families since close child spacing would vitiate the hypothe-&#13;
sized cognitive stimulation of the older sibling who would not be sufficiently&#13;
advanced in school. Negative child-spacing effects are also found in the&#13;
non-cognitive school-readiness measure particularly for children in two-parent&#13;
families in which an interval of less than 1 year with the next oldest sib-&#13;
ling retarded performance by over 1.3 times the sample standard deviation of&#13;
the test score. It should be noted that, anomalously, in the case of some&#13;
visual skills and the self-image measure, close child-spacing actually facil-&#13;
itated performance in two-parent families.&#13;
On the whole, demographic effects on child performance in this&#13;
sample do not reveal clear-cut patterns. One may conclude only that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
standard negative effects associated uith child order and opecing canot&#13;
be assumed to hold for all disadvantaged groups. It atlo esmo clsasg thet&#13;
effect of family size or spacing can be expected to viyy with pareicular&#13;
outcome or ability measures.&#13;

SECTION III - Pre-school Intervention&#13;
The previous two sections have examined in detail the role of&#13;
ability in the modeling of earnings determination and the factors which&#13;
themselves contribute to different childhood abilities. In the present&#13;
section some comments are offered on the evaluation of intervention programs&#13;
designed to improve pre-school abilities and on the prospects for organizing&#13;
operationally-oriented research on these issues in LDCs.&#13;
Numerous detailed reviews of the literature on compensatory educa-&#13;
tion for pre-school children have been completed in the past four years.&#13;
The accompanying paper by M. Smilansky 1/ reviews in detail most of the experi-&#13;
ments and special projects in compensatory education conducted during the late&#13;
sixties and early seventies. Smilansky's conclusions are similar to those&#13;
of other reviewers, such as U. Bronfenbrenner 2/ in stressing the ephemeral&#13;
gains produced by most well-designed intervention projects (ill-designed&#13;
projects do not generally produce even ephemeral gains, though many different&#13;
curricula have been found effective so that the constraint, "well-designed"&#13;
encompasses a wide range of "treatments"). Smilansky's discussion of parental&#13;
involvement is particularly valuable as this quite promising aspect of&#13;
intervention programs seemed to be in danger of overselling as a result of&#13;
the Bronfenbrenner review. 3/&#13;
There is no question that pessimism concerning the medium-&#13;
term effects of pre-school intervention in IQ is well-founded. But&#13;

before writing off any possibility of significantly augmenting the intel-&#13;
lectual capacity of environmentally disadvantaged children, the following&#13;
mitigating factors might be considered (as the thoughts of an economist&#13;
wandering somewhat afield these observations should be appropriately dis-&#13;
counted):&#13;
10 A critical consideration of the evaluation tools and the&#13;
determination of appropriate criteria for success;&#13;
2. The adequacy of evidence concerning the appropriate period&#13;
for intervention;&#13;
3. Two counter-instances of long-term intervention success.&#13;
The evaluation pattern for most intervention projects has followed&#13;
standard experimental procedure. An experimental group(s) and a more or less&#13;
carefully matched control group are followed through the treatment period and&#13;
beyond, with longitudinal measurement of the selected outcome measures. The&#13;
treatment group and controls are presumed to have an identical distribution of&#13;
environments outside the intervention program and subsequently (in primary&#13;
school). The standard pattern of results reviewed by Smilansky and others is&#13;
shown in Figure 1l&#13;

Although formally similar, the methodology which has consistently&#13;
generated this pattern of results may yield quite different implications than&#13;
econometric methodology. The two approaches are illustrated in Figure 2: 1/&#13;
Figure 2&#13;

The experimentalist tries to match two groups on relevant characteristics and&#13;
then focuses on a set of outcomes Zi to look for significantly different out-&#13;
comes. The econometrician typically would deal with the experimental treat-&#13;
ment as one of the set of explanatory variables, and ask whether that particu-&#13;
lar variable was a significant predictor of Zi (which is more often, though&#13;
not necessarily, restricted to a single outcome). If the experimental and&#13;
control groups, GI and G2, are quite well matched on the set of explanatory&#13;
variables then the two procedures should yield identical results. But&#13;
suppose there is interaction between the treatment and the set of other&#13;
explanatory variables;&#13;
1/   This distinction has been advanced by G. Orcutt in considering the meth-&#13;
odology for elicting experimental effects from income maintenance ex-&#13;
periments. In that context Orcutt has argued for a more experimental&#13;
approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
in these circumstances the experimental variable, T1, would continue to be&#13;
statistically significant, even though the set of outcome measures Zi could&#13;
not be significantly differentiated between G   and G2' Possibilities along&#13;
these lines suggest themselves in the early childhood intervention field. In&#13;
all cases of the intervention projects reviewed by Smilansky, Bronfenbreriner&#13;
and others, convergence of IQ scores occurred two, three or occasionally four&#13;
years into the regular elementary school system. In the school environment&#13;
children from disadvantaged backgrounds are not expected to perform well,&#13;
especially if they come from a readily identifiable minority. The highly&#13;
supportive, organized, and directed pre-school environment is left behind&#13;
for an often hostile school environment that in practice if not intention&#13;
reflects a quite different educational approach. Thus, an experience that&#13;
is orienting for the control group is dis-orienting for the experimentals.&#13;
Certainly this interpretation is consistent with a pattern of results summa-&#13;
rized in Figure 10 Measurements of the schooling environment specific to the&#13;
individual children (i.e., not based on classroom or school-wide means) would&#13;
be required to satisfactorily test this hypothesis. Some indirect, supporting&#13;
evidence may be found in the comparative curriculum program of the High/Scope&#13;
Educational Research Foundation in which gains made initially in its cogn:i-&#13;
tively-oriented pre-school curriculum are maintained when the same curriculum&#13;
approach is continued in primary school. 1/&#13;
One early reaction to the predominantly negative assessments of in-&#13;
tervention programs was to argue that intervention even at ages 3-4 occurred&#13;
too late: infant programs were required0 Smilansky is properly skeptical&#13;
1/   Information on these programs was presented during a field visit to the&#13;
High Scope Foundation in August 1976. No direct comparative evidence&#13;
is available on this hypothesis, as the comparative curriculum program&#13;
was not designed to follow-up varying pre-school experiences0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
that these may be viewed as any more panacean than the pre-school age pro-&#13;
grams--though one may suspect that such skepticism should be grounded less&#13;
in the merit of the respective programs than in sort of reasoning just&#13;
presented, namely that "stimulated" infants are more likely to be repressed&#13;
by subsequent "normal" environments than "control" infants. However, there&#13;
is some reason to believe that fostering mother-infant interaction does have&#13;
a broader beneficial impact which exceeds later pre-school intervention,&#13;
because, as Smilansky notes, this sort of intervention can have significant&#13;
effects beyond the cognitive domain. Evidence from both I. Gordon's mother&#13;
education project in rural Florida and D. Lambrie's mother-infant intervention&#13;
project in Michigan indicate that the level and quality of mother-infant&#13;
interactions can be significantly increased through home visiting programs&#13;
with paraprofessional staffing often by previously assisted mothers. 1/&#13;
Preliminary evidence from a similar project, now ongoing, among slum-dwellers&#13;
in Bogota, Colombia, indicates that the fostering of such interactions may&#13;
significantly improve the infants' anthropometric profiles relative to free or&#13;
subsidized nutritional supplementation. (The intervention in this project is&#13;
based on the Lambrie model). If this differential is confirmed and maintained,&#13;
it has implications for traditional education approaches, for nutrition&#13;
programming, and for family planning activities. To the extent that increased&#13;
parent-child interaction is utility-creating for the parent and productive of&#13;
a more successful, responsive child, one might expect an increase in the&#13;
motivation to space children more optimally in order to facilitate such&#13;
interaction. The increased time allocated by the parent to such interaction&#13;
might be considered as a substitute with time which would have been allocated&#13;
simply to the physical caring of another child. At any rate, these sorts of&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-42 &#13;
potential benefits from infant-oriented intervention projects will not be&#13;
picked up in the ordinary stream of IQ oriented evaluations. 1/&#13;
Other problems, acknowledged as well by Smilansky, stem from the&#13;
almost complete dependence on IQ tests as evaluation instruments0 Returning&#13;
to the discussion of Section I, if the surest way to insure high inter-&#13;
temporal correlations on an instrument designed to measure the theoretical&#13;
construct, fixed intelligence, is to design a test that reflects the rela-&#13;
tively constant environmental factors (in particular, home environment) then&#13;
the eventual regression to the mean on this particular measure is perhaps&#13;
less remarkable than the original experimental effect. If one adopts a&#13;
developmental theory of intelligence, it is plausible that these particular&#13;
aspects of cognitive intelligence augmented in early childhood and measured by&#13;
IQ tests are again distributed normally by age 8 or 9 with the variance in&#13;
that distribution accounted for at that age, largely by genetic and the more&#13;
constant environmental factors. However, the relatively earlier attainment of&#13;
specific cognitive skills may allow the child, with adequate support, to&#13;
broaden his range of cognitive skills to include, for example, richness in&#13;
written and verbal expression0 There is evidence that as age increases treat-&#13;
ment-control differences in IQ evaluations reflect different, more progressively&#13;
difficult items0 Furthermore the development of tests to measure language&#13;
1/   On the psychoanalytic plane, E. Hagen argues in On the Theory of Social&#13;
Change (The Dorsey Press, Homewood, Ill., 1962) that a revolutionary&#13;
change in the patterns of intergenerational interaction is required&#13;
to actuate economic change0 Similar reasoning undoubtedly underlies&#13;
Tanzania's program of day care activities though the process is there&#13;
envisioned as a collective one0 The stimulation of greater mother-infant&#13;
interaction within existing familial structures might provide similar&#13;
results for societies which are not collective-oriented. Though now&#13;
admittedly simplistic on both the psychological and economic dimensions&#13;
Hagen's work remains one of the few efforts to integrate these two&#13;
important aspects of development0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
richness indicates that this broadening of skills may be a more lasting&#13;
result of cognitively and linguistically oriented pre-school and elementary&#13;
school curricula. 1/&#13;
Finally, mention should be made of two exceptions to the generally&#13;
negative evaluations of pre-school intervention. First, the Perry Pre-school&#13;
Project begun in Ypsilanti, Michigan, in the early 1960s has perhaps the&#13;
longest longitudinal span of any intervention project with the original&#13;
cohort scheduled to graduate from high school in May, 1976. Although the&#13;
pattern of IQ results is consistent with Figure 1, the treatment group has&#13;
placed significantly fewer students in special education or retained them in&#13;
grade as compared to the control group (17.5% as contrasted to 35%). Further-&#13;
more the treatment groups appear to have had significantly fewer dropouts.&#13;
These two factors alone have been estimated to yield a 9% social rate of&#13;
return to one year of intervention (this falls to less than 4% for two years&#13;
of intervention). 2/ In another longer term follow-up, F. Palmer located the&#13;
treatment group of an intervention program for 2-year old males in Harlem, New&#13;
York City. At 10 years of age the treatment group had an IQ slightly over 100&#13;
(representing a significant 6 point advantage over non-treatment males) and&#13;
they were reading at a level 3 months ahead of the New York City mean (which&#13;
includes advantaged students and girls who at age 10 generally read 2-4 months&#13;
ahead of boys). Palmer estimated conservatively that these black males from&#13;
1/   Again the specific reference is to the High/Scope Foundation's efforts&#13;
at developing "the Productive Language Assessment" which differentiates&#13;
children on the basis of communicative richness and organizational&#13;
complexity.&#13;

the treatment group were reading at least 6 months ahead of their black male&#13;
peers. He also found significantly fewer of the treatment group held back in&#13;
grade. 1/ The upshot of this admittedly piecemeal evidence as well as the&#13;
doubts concerning the evaluation methodology would seem, at least, to raise&#13;
the degree of ambiguity surrounding the verdict on early intervention in the&#13;
United States.&#13;
What has been the experience of the less developed countries in&#13;
setting or implementing policies affecting pre-school child development? In&#13;
general few LDCs have accorded much recognition to the environment within&#13;
which young children are expected to develop. Exceptions have occurred in&#13;
countries where (i) the government wishes to foster a relatively rapid&#13;
transformation of society, such as Tanzania or Peru (also, apparently, in&#13;
revolutionary regimes such as China or Cuba), or (ii) where the degree of&#13;
urbanization and/or labor force participation of urban women spur the demand&#13;
for day care, with examples such as Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Ghana, Singapore,&#13;
Iran and Egypt, or (iii) when rural labor practice and the demand for limited&#13;
primary school slots coincide to generate a demand for pre-school education,&#13;
as in Kenya. 2/&#13;
Even in countries which have reconized that the environment of&#13;
young children might be the proper object for intervention policies, program&#13;
design has been limited and implementation even more so. This hesitation is&#13;
related to two basic, and as yet unresolved, issues for LDC policy makers:&#13;

Ten Years of Life, University of Florida, 1976.&#13;

(1) do pre-school outcomes translate into later effects on adult productiv-&#13;
ity, and (2) if such effects may be reasonably expected, how can pre-school&#13;
outcomes be efficiently enhanced? In the case of the first question, little&#13;
longitudinal evidence has yet surfaced which specifically relates to LDC&#13;
environments. However, it is instructive to note that sources of data on&#13;
this question became evident in the U.S. and Western Europe only after&#13;
theoretical interest in the question had been articulated. The Taubman,&#13;
Leibowitz and Hause studies discussed in Section I were all based on data&#13;
whose existence was "rediscovered" and which was then updated for the lon-&#13;
gitudinal analysis. Similar possibilities may exist in many LDCs once re-&#13;
searchers become attuned to the issues. 1/&#13;
Another possibility to develop a better understanding of the issues&#13;
would be to follow up the school performance of children who have participated&#13;
in the relatively few existing pre-school intervention projects. One of the&#13;
best documented of such projects has been conducted with Ford Foundation&#13;
support in Cali, Colombia, since 1968. Both nutritional supplementation and&#13;
a cognitively-oriented pre-school curriculum were incorporated in the project.&#13;
Initial results show that the combination of cognitive stimulation and&#13;
nutritional supplementation produced ability outcomes from disadvantaged&#13;
children which were not significantly different than those for children from&#13;
relatively well-to-do backgrounds. Nutritional supplementation alone did not&#13;
have such an effect. (Similar though less pronounced results were reported&#13;
1/   For example, data collected by the Grace Department of Research, British-&#13;
American Hospital in Peru over the last 15 years includes both schooling&#13;
and medical outcomes for a large sample of children as well as detailed&#13;
family background information. As these children will enter the labor&#13;
force within the next few years, continued monitoring or re-interviewing&#13;
in 5 years could result in an extremely rich longitudinal panel.&#13;

on anthropometric measures.) 1/ Plans are to extend the evaluation to&#13;
primary school performance.&#13;
Other projects which are potential sources of data on the effects&#13;
of pre-school intervention are included in the activities of UNICEF and, on&#13;
a much more limited scale, of the Bernard Van Leer Foundation. 2/ In par-&#13;
ticular UNICEF has projects in Tanzania and Peru which have attempted to&#13;
integrate specific pre-school education objectives within a rural development&#13;
program. The project in Puno, Peru, utilizes a similar curriculum to that&#13;
developed in Cali, while the Tanzania project is intended primarily to extend&#13;
to selected ujama settlements day-care services along the lines of those&#13;
already functioning elsewhere in the country0 In neither case has any sub-&#13;
stantive research and evaluation component related specifically to effects on&#13;
pre-school abilities and their connection to subsequent performance been&#13;
included in the project design. If this were done, a body of evidence ona the&#13;
effects of intervention could be established and a significant sample followed&#13;
longitudinally.&#13;
Similar research possibilities exist with numerous projects assisted&#13;
by the Van Leer Foundation0 All are of a pilot or experimental nature; but,&#13;
based on published project descriptions, none include a research component&#13;
well-focused on child outcomes and designed to inform policy-makers. The&#13;

scope of the Van Leer assisted projects is apparent from Table 3 which lists&#13;
those funded as of late 1975. It is evident that considerable data on pre-&#13;
school outcomes in a wide range of countries does or could exist as a result&#13;
of the Van Leer projects. A few do have specific evaluation components&#13;
and one describes research on the effectiveness of the pre-school programs.&#13;
Nevertheless the opportunity clearly exists for research which could bring&#13;
relevant evidence to the policy-maker on the question of relation between&#13;
pre-school experience and subsequent performance, either in school or on the&#13;
job.&#13;
Both the UNICEF and Van Leer projects also cover a broad range of&#13;
intervention approaches; an operational evaluation of these could help answer&#13;
the second, technological, question of how pre-school intervention can be&#13;
made cost-effective given the necessary low child-adult ratios generally&#13;
thought to be required. The Puno, Peru, project of UNICEF could again offer&#13;
guidance on this question. Using the approach of the High/Scope Educational&#13;
Research Foundation, which has now been extensively tested in both the United&#13;
States and Latin America, a basic cognitive orientation to the curriculum is&#13;
established emphasizing particular ability-generating activities. Within&#13;
this framework, the interaction with the child can be undertaken by minimally&#13;
trained (though well-supervised) personnel. Mothers and older children, in&#13;
particular, become effective trainers either in home- or center-based activi-&#13;
ties. This approach has also been adopted in community day-care activities&#13;
in Chile, which utilize low-cost structures or open space on community lands&#13;
to house day-care activities which draw almost exclusively on paraprofessional&#13;
personnel for staffing. In this case the paraprofessionals are often teen-&#13;
agers who have no other focus of activity. There is reason to believe that&#13;

the High/Scope approach is one which can be implemented without extensive&#13;
pre-service training programs, and no more than minimal physical facilities.&#13;
Numerous Van Leer assisted projects seem oriented toward integrat-&#13;
ing pre-school intervention with other community activites; however, this&#13;
is often within the structure of a special development or training center&#13;
functioning outside existing institutions. A further accommodation of pre-&#13;
school intervention practices to traditional patterns of child care would&#13;
seem to be one of the best ways of preserving those values and attitudes of&#13;
traditional society that are often casualties of the modernizing process while&#13;
at the same time augmenting pre-school outcomes. 2/ Adapting to traditional&#13;
patterns also increases the likelihood of developing intervention programs&#13;
at significantly lower costs than associated with "western" models. For&#13;
example, in many cultures, responsibility for infant and toddler care tradi-&#13;
tionally falls on the cohort of 5-8 year olds within the extended family.&#13;
However, as school attendance broadens to include greater proportions of&#13;
girls, the availability of caretakers has declined. Increasingly infants&#13;
are "cared for" by toddlers or taken to the fields. The demand for rural&#13;
day-care centers has consequently increased, but as separate institutions&#13;
these are expensive to staff and maintain, and receive little priority from&#13;
governments burdened with expensive and often ill-adapted primary school&#13;
systems. In such circumstances, the incorporation of day-care centers&#13;

into primary and secondary school activities offers numerous potential bene-&#13;
fits. Care of pre-schoolers could be returned to a limited extent and under&#13;
supportive supervision to the children who traditionally bore this respon*-&#13;
sibility. Possibilities would exist for basic, practical family life and&#13;
population education (at least in secondary school). Such an arrangement&#13;
would also facilitate the integration of pre-school and primary school cu:rri-&#13;
cula, which seems to be an essential condition for maintaining many of the&#13;
cognitive gains which result from well-designed pre-school intervention&#13;
projects.&#13;
More detailed analysis of family support or pre-school intervention&#13;
program in LDCs is required before specific policy recommendations can be&#13;
made. However, policies and programs identified and discussed here do seem&#13;
to constitute a basis for a more thorough investigation of the technology&#13;
of pre-school intervention and of its short- to medium-term effects. UNICEF,&#13;
in particular, is in an ideal position to identify effective experimental&#13;
or pilot projects from which a great deal more could be learned, given an&#13;
effective research and evaluation efforto&#13;

Implications for the Bank&#13;
What conclusion for Bank involvement in the field of pre-school&#13;
child development may be drawn from the studies reported here?&#13;
These studies were undertaken in the United States and Western&#13;
Europe in an effort to single out and measure the hypothesized effect&#13;
of ability on earnings. They demonstrate--variably--this effect as well&#13;
as the effect on ability of family structure and economic environment.&#13;
Comparable studies for LDC's do not exist because of the paucity of&#13;
collected empirical evidence in these countries, where the patterns ahd&#13;
magnitudes of the estimated relationships could be different from those&#13;
of developed countries.&#13;
Consideration should be given to potential research inputs to&#13;
existing pre-school projects or programs, perhaps on a collaborative basis&#13;
with UNICEF. This could significantly increase our understanding of the&#13;
effects of different pre-school environments in the LDC context. A better&#13;
understanding the curriculums and institutional settings that seem to work&#13;
for pre-school and early primary children could increase the complementarity&#13;
between pre-school and primary education, thereby enhancing the productivity&#13;
of the Bank's investments in the latter. Obviously the direct payoff&#13;
to LDC-focused research on these questions will be some years hence.&#13;
What are the more immediate implications for the Bank? The&#13;
results reported in Section II further validate the intimate connection&#13;
between the status of the mother and the development of the child. The&#13;
Bank has recognized that many development projects can have important&#13;
effects on women through the provision or loss of income earning opportunities,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
through effects on family structures, or through the inclusion or neglect&#13;
of important services which may particularly affect women. It now seems&#13;
apparent, that in its monitoring of these effects, the Bank should include&#13;
the impact of changes in the status of women on outcomes for young children.&#13;
This type of monitoring will also provide an important source of information&#13;
on the relationship between development activities and family structure&#13;
with a view toward the eventual development of project components which&#13;
might address more directly problems in increasing the productive potential&#13;
of young children in deprived LDC environments.&#13;

APPENDIX&#13;
In this appendix some additional comments are made on the studies&#13;
by Taubman and Leibowitz 1/ and an extensive description of the Gary Income&#13;
Maintenance sample data is provided with a detailed exposition of results.&#13;
It was noted that Taubman's investigation incorporates a biography&#13;
variable which includes "prior education differences, grades in school and&#13;
family SES." This composite is found to have a quite significant coefficient;&#13;
but the relationship adds little to our understanding of ability formation as&#13;
it is precisely among these variables that one would want to distinguish&#13;
separate and/or interactive effects. Two other environmental variables have&#13;
large significant coefficients: (i) Jewish upbringing is positively related&#13;
to ability scores, and (ii) being raised by grandparents is negatively related&#13;
to ability with a very large coefficient. The former is interesting in light&#13;
of E. Hagan's hypothesis about cultural adaptations to social change. 2/&#13;
Hagan argues that families with a particular set of psychological character-&#13;
istics will adapt themselves and their child-rearing practices much more&#13;
readily to educational, economic and entrepreneurial goals congruent with&#13;
rapid social and economic transformation particularly when under cultural&#13;
stress. It may be argued that Jews in the twentieth century U.S. environment&#13;
exemplify such characteristics. (Hagan develops related case studies in&#13;
Burma, Indonesia, Colombia, among LDC's.) The detrimental effect of being&#13;
raised by grandparents is not discussed by Taubman but could relate to a&#13;
number of important factors: a poor health endowment of the child (if, for&#13;

example, the mother died in childbirth or related circumstances), culturaLly&#13;
atypical family relationships, lower income and living standards (not un-&#13;
likely in the pre-World War II environment in which Taubman's sample grew up)&#13;
or reduced adult-child interaction with grandparents having numerous other&#13;
responsibilities or interests. Certainly these are not exhaustive but the&#13;
size of the coefficient (105 times the standard error of the dependent&#13;
variable) suggests that some crucial effect in the child's background is&#13;
being picked up.&#13;
Finally Taubman includes for control purposes two sets of ex post&#13;
variables reflecting occupational choice factors and personal circumstances&#13;
when entering the labor force. These cannot, of course, be interpreted in a&#13;
directly causal manner, though they may reflect underlying traits which could&#13;
have affected test performance. They may, in part, also measure subsequent&#13;
outcomes determined by skills and abilities (thus reversing the causal flow&#13;
assumed in the estimating equation)0 The first is a statistically significant&#13;
association between higher ability scores and the dominance of financial over&#13;
non-pecuniary motives in occupational choice0 In another dimension, early&#13;
marriage is negatively associated with ability0 Finally self-employment and&#13;
the perception of financial pressure when entering the labor force are asso-&#13;
ciated with higher ability scores0 Although such evidence is spotty, it does&#13;
indicate some of the ways in which ability may be associated with motivatLons&#13;
and entrepreneurial skills0&#13;
Based on her results, Leibowitz makes an interesting but perhaps&#13;
overstated argument regarding the effect of family income on children's&#13;
ability0 First she contends that mothers' education reflects the produc-&#13;
tivity of time inputs to children rather than serving as a proxy for genetic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
traits or family income since the entire effect is picked up by mothers' not&#13;
fathers' education. This is true if one thought of education solely as proxy&#13;
for genes and/or income; but it does not rule out interactive effects between&#13;
mother's home productivity measured by education and unmeasured but correlated&#13;
variables such as income. Leibowitz finds further evidence for no income&#13;
effect on pre-school ability in the insignificance of coefficients on the&#13;
presence of consumption durables such as color TV or hi-fis. But the pre-&#13;
sence of such goods cannot be regarded as an adequate proxy for income:&#13;
surely the distribution of their possession does not resemble the distribution&#13;
of income. Nor does Leibowitz report whether the greater effect of "goods,"&#13;
which showed up in her urban sample, extends beyond dishwashers and dryers to&#13;
color TVs and hi-fis--to the extent that the urban sample is poorer, one&#13;
might expect stronger income effects, assuming the production of abilities&#13;
exhibits diminishing returns. Thus, in neither the Leibowitz nor Taubman&#13;
ability production function estimates was there adequate treatment of income&#13;
and its interaction with other home environment variables.&#13;
The data set which has been used by the present author to estimate&#13;
a general pre-school ability function, may have somewhat closer affinity to&#13;
the LDC context. As an adjunct to an Income Maintenance Experiment conducted&#13;
by the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare, a series&#13;
of tests was administered to the pre-school children in a sub-sample of&#13;
families participating in the experiment. The experiment enrolled fami-&#13;
lies having earned incomes ranging from zero to about $15,000; all families&#13;
were residents in four neighborhoods of Gary, Indiana and all were black.&#13;
Approximately 65% of the sub-sample were female-headed families. To the&#13;
extent that this sample reflects a low income group with marginal&#13;

connections to sources of status or economic growth in the national econormy,&#13;
its relative circumstances may not be too dissimilar from those faced by&#13;
dwellers in the slums and peri-urban settlements of many LDC'so At any rate&#13;
the sample is quite different from others used to estimate the effects an,i&#13;
determinants of human capital investments in young children0 1/ In particular&#13;
this investigation focuses on ability outcomes for those children for whom&#13;
intervention programs have been, and presumably will continue to be, designed&#13;
and thus may shed some light on the framework within which intervention must&#13;
operate.&#13;
Information concerning the set of ability measures is summarized in&#13;
Table Al0 The classification of test by type is admittedly arbitrary since&#13;
both cognitive and affective or social-emotional traits are clearly operative&#13;
in all testing situations; however, within broad limits the predominant orien-&#13;
tation of the test is listed firsts followed by secondary factors. The vector&#13;
of outcomes is considerably more diversified between cognitive and affective&#13;
traits than previously reported investigations. Three of the tests are pre-&#13;
dominantly cognitive; two measure predominantly affective traits, while one&#13;
relates primarily to visual-motor skills. All the tests exhibit significaLnt&#13;
developmental sensitivity, as measured by the percentage effect on the tes,t&#13;
score of one sample standard deviation in age0 However, this age or develop-&#13;
mental effect varies considerably: the Seguin Form Board Test having the&#13;
1/ Taubman's sample all lay within the upper half of the ability distribu-&#13;
tion. The Leibowitz/Terman Sample (reported in Section I) similarly was&#13;
quite biased toward high ability scorers; while the Leibowitz/Sesame data&#13;
(discussed above in Section III) presumably included low ability scorers&#13;
though no precise breakdown in presented.&#13;

greatest age effect and the Wechsler Pre-school and Primary Scale of Intel-&#13;
ligence, a common IQ measure, showing the least age effect. I/&#13;
A set of explanatory variables is presented in Table A2. These&#13;
group into five categories and are motivated by the following considerations:&#13;
1.   Child-Specific Variables:   age, sex, child order and&#13;
spacing - Age and sex are self-explanatory. These&#13;
variables are introduced primarily as controls but they are&#13;
of interest in their interaction with other policy related&#13;
variables. Child order and child spacing have often been&#13;
found to have a significant affect on ability measures&#13;
similar to IQ. 2/&#13;
2.   Test-Related Variables:   Test order, test administrators -&#13;
pre-school children are particularly susceptible to the&#13;
abnormal environmental conditions inherent in most testing&#13;
situations and are sensitive as well to the presence of the&#13;
test administrator. 3/ Although the test environment was&#13;
i/   The attenuated age effect on the WPSSI is due to some extent to the&#13;
scoring procedure which averaged the number of completed items. Since&#13;
questioning stops after two consecutive misses in the arithmetic, picture&#13;
completion and block design sub-tests, there was some tendency for older&#13;
children to complete more which would be imperfectly reflected in the&#13;
average score.&#13;
2/   See in particular R. Zajene and G. Markus, "Birth Order and Intellectual&#13;
Development", Psychological Review, in press, mimeo, 1975. They use data&#13;
on a population cohort from the Netherlands to estimate a one parameter&#13;
model relating abilities to family size stratifying by sibling position.&#13;
3/   E. Zigler, R. Abelson and V. Seitz, "Motivational Factors in the&#13;
Performance of Economically Disadvantaged Children on the Peabody Picture&#13;
Vocabulary Test," in Child Development, 1973, have documented significant&#13;
test-environmental effects on a sample of Head Start pre-school children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58 -&#13;
familiar to the subjects in this sample (tests were given&#13;
at home), the order of the test, the training of the admini-&#13;
strator and the time of day were all thought possibly to have&#13;
significant effects on the test outcomes. Preliminary investi-&#13;
gation eliminated time of day; but test order and training&#13;
of the test administrator were retained in the analysis&#13;
reported here.&#13;
3.   Mother's Status:   female head of the household, and mother's&#13;
education. Almost all investigations of the production of&#13;
childhood abilities find significant effects related to the&#13;
education of the mother (though the interpretation of these&#13;
effects is often confounded by the omitted variables problem).&#13;
In this sample years of mother's education was found to be&#13;
most effective when treated as a dichotomous variable based on&#13;
the completion of twelve or more years of education. 1/ It&#13;
is anticipated that a significant coefficient on this variable&#13;
would reflect the mother's productivity in child rearing&#13;
(though perhaps also serving as a proxy for genetic endow-&#13;
ment). In the case of female headed families the anticipated&#13;
effect is ambiguous. Female household heads may have suffi-&#13;
ciently broader responsibilities or demands on their time so&#13;
that effective interaction with children is significantly re-&#13;
duced. Similarly the climate of female-headed households that&#13;
are in transition from previous two-parent households may be&#13;
Differences between this dummy variable and a continuous variable,&#13;
mother's years of education, were not significant however.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
disruptive to ability generation of either cognitive or affective&#13;
traits. 1/ Female-headed households are a relatively common&#13;
phenomenon in the rural areas of many LDC's as urban centers&#13;
attract predominantly male immigrants who effectively abandon their&#13;
rural families for long and uncertain periods of time. 2/ However,&#13;
one might also expect positive effects to be attached to single-&#13;
parenthood. If the status of the mother is consistently denigrated&#13;
in two-parent families and the father takes little active part in&#13;
child rearing, then the effectiveness of the mother's interaction&#13;
with her children could be seriously undermined in traditional&#13;
two-parent families. In the single parent household, the child,&#13;
in contrast, is interacting with the very adult that he also per-&#13;
ceives to have high status. This perception may significantly&#13;
augment the effect of mother-child interaction on the acquisition&#13;
of cognitive and affective traits.&#13;
4.   Labor Force Participation and Unemployment - these dimensions&#13;
of the family environment may significantly affect outcomes&#13;
for children through their effect on stability and stress&#13;
within the home (holding constant the effects of income) or&#13;
they may operate primarily as indicators of the allocation&#13;
of adult time between the workplace and the home. In the&#13;
1/   This is not to deny that the single-parent household may not be a&#13;
significant improvement over an unstable two-parent household. Indeed&#13;
the comment is based on that premise.&#13;
2/   On the effects of such arrangements among families of rural Nyeri dis-&#13;
trict in Kenya, see S. Abbot, "Full-time Farmers and Week-end Wives -&#13;
An Analysis of Altering Conjugal Roles," Journal of Marriage and the&#13;
Family, 1976, and the references therein.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
former case one would expect a positive effect from labor&#13;
force participation and a negative impact from unemployment,&#13;
If the operative condition is time allocation the opposite&#13;
effects would be anticipated.&#13;
5.   Income Related Variables - the context of the present investi-&#13;
gation allowed a much more detailed specification of family&#13;
income than has usually been possible in such studies. Spe-&#13;
cifically average monthly income was grouped into categories&#13;
of: (i) earned income, (ii) unearned income including all&#13;
traditional welfare payments, and (iii) experimental transfer&#13;
payments. The latter constitute the treatment in the experi-&#13;
mental group; to the extent that any experimental effect is&#13;
anticipated it should show up here. The design of the Income&#13;
Maintenance Experiment also included a group of families with&#13;
incomes considerably above the poverty level. In order to&#13;
allow for non-linear effects in higher income earning families,&#13;
the square of earned income was also included as an explanatory&#13;
variable. Finally there may be good reason to believe that&#13;
changes in income might have significant effects on the family&#13;
environment0 Families suffering losses in income may be ex-&#13;
pected to be under considerably greater stress as they struggle&#13;
to maintain previous standards of consumption. Services pre-&#13;
viously purchased may have to be provided within the family,&#13;
possibly reducing the interaction between parents and young&#13;
children0 Child oriented goods may also be sacrificed0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
Reverse effects may reasonably be expected for increases in&#13;
income. In an effort to capture some of these possibilities,&#13;
the differences in average monthly income earned, unearned,&#13;
and experimental, between the two years of the investigation&#13;
period (1972 &amp; 1973) were included as explanatory variables.&#13;
The results of this investigation are summarized in Table A3, A4&#13;
and A5. Table A3 summarizes regressions using various outcomes from the&#13;
Seguin Form Test; Table A4 reports on four tests with strong affective com-&#13;
ponents (Role Identification, Pre-school Inventory, School Readiness, and&#13;
Self-Concept); and Table A5 reports on four subtests of the Wechsler Preschool&#13;
and Primary Scale of Intelligence. Only coefficients are reported for which&#13;
the probability exceeds 0.9 that the estimated value is significantly dif-&#13;
ferent than zero. This is a liberal criterion but is used to give a richer&#13;
picture of the likely structure and reflects a belief that estimation in this&#13;
field must be regarded as exploratory rather than confirmatory in character.&#13;
In each table results are reported not only for the full test sample but also&#13;
for various subsamples grouped on the mother's status variables, education and&#13;
family head. In Table A4 regressions are also reported on the subsample of&#13;
those children with positive responsiveness (i.e., children who refused to&#13;
take the test were excluded in the estimation for this subsample).&#13;
The Seguin Form Board Test, the outcome measure of Table A3 measures&#13;
cognitive traits through visual-motor dexterity. It can also be interpreted&#13;
as an indicator of short-term learning by analyzing differences in the three&#13;
trials that are usually given. Two dimensions of the test are recognized:&#13;
(1) speed and (2) accuracy. Maturation has a highly significant effect on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62 -&#13;
both dimensions, but not on short-term learning ability. Both speed and&#13;
accuracy are reduced by unfavorable testing conditions; but child specific&#13;
characteristics other than age do not significantly affect performance (with&#13;
the exception that close child spacing does reduce accuracy). Both effects&#13;
of mother's status are significant; however, mother's education has only 35%&#13;
to 40% of the impact that female-headed households have. Being in a female-&#13;
headed household increases the speed of the child's response by as much as 16&#13;
months of additional maturation and the effect on accuracy is almost as great.&#13;
Labor force participation of the family head positively affects both speed&#13;
and accuracy of performance by an amount equivalent to 7-9 months maturation0&#13;
Finally family income has similar positive effects: earned income on speed&#13;
and unearned income on accuracy0 On both test dimensions changes in both&#13;
types of income have significant effects although the magnitudes are rather&#13;
small0&#13;
On test outcomes intended to measure learning during the testing&#13;
process, the pattern of results is spotty; but one important factor is the&#13;
role of mother's status as a significant determinant of the child's learning&#13;
during the test0 This is particularly true in accounting for performance&#13;
changes between the 1st and 2nd trials, on both speed and accuracy0 There is&#13;
no consistent relationships to other explanatory variables, though labor force&#13;
participation is associated with poorer 2nd trial performance (in speed of&#13;
test completion) and increases in experimental transfers seem to be signifi-&#13;
cantly associated with test learning but the impact is small0&#13;
A grouping of observations into two pair of subsamples based on (i)&#13;
mother's education or (ii) the presence of a female household head facilitates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
an analysis of how mother's status interacts with the other explanatory&#13;
variables. Analysis of covariance reveals that the single-parent/two-parent&#13;
distinctiorn results in significantly different overall relationships for esti-&#13;
mating both speed and accuracy of child performance. However, the distinction&#13;
is not maintained if a log-transformation of the speed score is used nor in&#13;
all but one of test learning relationships. The high school/less-than-high&#13;
school grouping produced significantly different overall relationships only in&#13;
the dimension of test accuracy and changes in accuracy between trials.&#13;
Examining the size and pattern of significent coefficients between&#13;
groups indicates some rather interesting differences. The effects of matura-&#13;
tion on speed are much more pronounced in two-parent than in single parent&#13;
families. 1/ Mother's high school education has a sizable and significant&#13;
effect within two-parent families but none at all within single-parent&#13;
families. This differentiation would seem to militate against a genetic&#13;
interpretation to mother's education although it does not rule out a genetic-&#13;
environmental interaction. Mother's education may therefore substitute, to&#13;
some degree, for the increased status of the single parent mother (at least&#13;
from the child's perspective). This effect of education may also be related&#13;
to the enhanced maturation effects in two-parent families. Finally the&#13;
incorne effects on speed of test completion are quite different:   performance&#13;
of children in two-parent families is positively related to experimental&#13;
transfer payments (with rather sizable effects) while other unearned income&#13;
1/   However these larger age coefficients do not significantly differ between&#13;
groups in their effect on the distribution of scores because the standard&#13;
deviation of the speed scores is similarly greater in the two-parent&#13;
sub-sample.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
provides a similar (though considerably smaller) effect in single-parent&#13;
families. This may be interpreted as reflecting the benefits to traditional&#13;
family structure from an income maintenance system as opposed to traditional&#13;
welfare which is alleged to disrupt families and from which female-headed&#13;
households are most likely to benefit. This distinction must be considered as&#13;
quite tentative as it is not maintained in other Seguin outcome measures. In&#13;
the accuracy outcomes one finds a differential effect of earned income in the&#13;
two types of families, with earned income having a negative effect on perform-&#13;
ance accuracy of children in female-headed households0 In this group labor&#13;
force participation has a significant positive effect; if this is due to the&#13;
enhanced status and security that labor force participation might provide the&#13;
single parent, then the negative impact of earned income might reflect the&#13;
reduced parent-child interaction that necessarily accompanies working by the&#13;
single parent0&#13;
Turning to the education sub-groups the most consistent difference&#13;
in coefficients among the Seguin outcomes is the very large positive effect&#13;
that a female-headed household has on the performance of children whose&#13;
mothers have less than 12 years of education0 This effect is consistent with&#13;
the interpretation of the two variables as reflecting different aspects of&#13;
the mother's status0 In other words, for the group of mothers with low&#13;
educational status, the effect of that low status on child performance is&#13;
mitigated by heading the household0 There does not appear to be a consistent&#13;
overall pattern to differences in coefficients on labor force or income&#13;
variables between the two education categories, although in the speed of&#13;
completion the entire effect of earned income seems to occur within the less&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
educated group which also exhibited a strong negative effect to employment.&#13;
This suggests that earned income and regular employment may substitute for&#13;
mother's education in the production of certain pre-school abilities. In&#13;
the "test learning" outcomes there is some indication that labor force par-&#13;
ticipation among less educated mothers significantly hinders performance.&#13;
This result may stem both from the types of employment that are generally&#13;
available to black women with low education and, since labor force par-&#13;
ticipation refers to family head, a relative reduction in the status/pro-&#13;
ductivity of less educated mothers when their spouses participate in the&#13;
labor force. The effect may also simply reflect a reduction in time allo-&#13;
cated to children with particular effects in this group due to a signifi-&#13;
cantly lower rate of substitution for less educated mothers between the&#13;
quantity and quality of time inputs.&#13;
Overall, this set of independent variables seems to generate&#13;
respectable explanatory power for the set of pre-school outcome measures&#13;
obtained from the Seguin Form Board Test. On the full sample, the explained&#13;
variance in speed and accuracy outcomes averages 45%. In the sub-samples,&#13;
the explanatory power increases from 50% to 70%. 1/ In the "test-learning"&#13;
relationship age or maturation is not generally a significant determinant of&#13;
performance and this reduces the explanatory power of the regressions (SEGDMI&#13;
1/   The log-transformation of the speed score (LSCT) seems preferable on&#13;
grounds of a somewhat lower standard error of estimate than the untrans-&#13;
formed score (SEGSCT). It also results in higher explained variance.&#13;
It is not discussed in the text as the paterns of coefficients do not&#13;
differ significantly. The implication of the log-transformation is that&#13;
the coefficients may be interpreted as percentage effects.&#13;

also seem generally interpretable within the anticipated framework. 1/&#13;
Table 4 contains results based on a set of four tests all of which&#13;
combine affective and cognitive components. The Pre-school Inventory (PSI)&#13;
was designed to be primarily a cognitive evaluation measure for Head Start&#13;
but it contains many elements that could best be classified as social-&#13;
emotional. A role identification test (ROL) was designed specifically for&#13;
this testing program by a staff member of the Income Maintenance Experiment.&#13;
While this test has no standardized norms, it consists of relatively straight-&#13;
forward questions about home and community figures, familiar to most pre-&#13;
schoolers0 It is most safely viewed as a test of information and comprehen-&#13;
sion, which emphases roles that the child might be expected to identify. A&#13;
widely used test for self-concept, the Brown Referent Scale, taps information&#13;
not only on the child's perception of himself but also on his willingness to&#13;
communicate emotions, and his comprehension of terminology. Finally another&#13;
test developed for Head Start, Gumpgookies (GMP), is intended to measure&#13;
school readiness through non-verbal responses.&#13;
The same groupings of observations are reported in Table 4 as&#13;
in Table 3 with the addition of a "non-zero response" group0 In each of&#13;
these tests (PSI, ROL, BRN, GMP), ten to fifteen percent of the children&#13;
simply refused to take the tests. As such passivity is itself a response&#13;
but quite different from a wrong answer, non-reactions were scored zero,&#13;
1/   One coefficient for which no ready interpretation is apparent is the&#13;
positive effect of the number of "disabled" children reported by the&#13;
mother0 This may serve as a proxy for extra services or possibly extra&#13;
income unreported in regular channels0 It may also reflect greater&#13;
awareness and sensitivity of the mother to child development0 It was&#13;
anticipated to have a negative effect reflecting increased stress&#13;
within the household.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
wrong answers one, and correct responses two. The "non-zero response"&#13;
columns of Table A4 (3, 9, 15, 21) report regressions on observations ex-&#13;
cluding the non-responders.&#13;
Considering the results on the full sample for each of these four&#13;
tests (columns 2, 8, 14, and 20 of Table 4), few generalizations emerge. On&#13;
the tests having greater cognitive content, PSI and ROL, one consistent effect&#13;
is the significant but modest impact of average monthly earned income. In&#13;
each case the impact of an additional 100 dollars of monthly income is equiva-&#13;
lent to 4-5 months in maturation. Additional monthly income of $500-$600&#13;
would be necessary to raise either score by its standard deviation. In both&#13;
cases earned income is subject to a "topping off" effect with its square being&#13;
negatively related to test performance (although monthly income of $800 in the&#13;
PSI equation and $1,200 in the ROL equation would be required before the total&#13;
earned income effect became negative). In the affective dominant tests (BRN,&#13;
GMP) no consistent effects are found but labor force participation and unem-&#13;
ployment do have significant positive and negative effects respectively on the&#13;
school readiness test. This is consistent with an interpretation that labor&#13;
force participation increases the stability of the household creating an&#13;
environment which facilitates the "production" of abilities while unemployment&#13;
has stress-creating effects. The labor force participation effect is substan-&#13;
tial, approximating a standard deviation in the GMP test scores. The self-&#13;
concept results show a negative effect to the number of children in the family&#13;
while close spacing with the subsequent sibling has a counter-intuitive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
positive effect (the spacing effect is reversed on the school readiness&#13;
test).,/ Changes in incomes were also related to affective outcomeso witkt&#13;
increases in earned income favorably affected the school readiness outco2l!o&#13;
While these differences are presumed to be related to the inco=x sourceD they&#13;
may also indicate differential sensitivity to increases or decreases in tricome&#13;
since earned income generally increased between the two years and unearmedc&#13;
income decreased on average. Motivation for school may have been relatively&#13;
more adversely affected by losses in income while self-concept responded&#13;
relatively more to rising incomes.&#13;
For all four tests, the subsample of non-zero scores has a signi-&#13;
ficantly different relationship to the set of explanatory variables than in&#13;
the full sample (as indicated by the F-scores for the non-zero response&#13;
samples)0 2/ The set of non-zero PSI scores is significantly mEre affected&#13;
by earned income. A $200 increment per month has an effect exceeding a&#13;
standard deviation of the non-zero PSI scores; however, this enhanced incoDi&#13;
effect is not evident for the non-zero ROL scores0 Another readily under-&#13;
standable result is the general reduction in the age coefficient in the&#13;
non-zero samples0 Maturation significantly increases the responsivenDes&#13;
of the child to strangers and this effect is picked up in the full sample&#13;
age coefficients0&#13;
1/ Other counter-intuitive results include a negative effect of mother's&#13;
education on the PSI score0 This seems to be primarily in two-parent&#13;
families and relates more to repsonsiveness that performance; but it&#13;
still is not readily interpretable0&#13;
2/   These F-scores were computed using the Chow Test for equality between&#13;
two sets of regression coefficients when the number of dependent&#13;
variables equals or exceeds the number of additional (in this case,&#13;
zero-valued) observations. See G. Chow5, "Tests of Equality between&#13;
Sets of Coeffidients in Two Lienar Regressions5," Econometria, l9600&#13;

Turning to the analysis of covariance between the mother's status&#13;
sub--groups (education and family head), the null hypothesis of overall homo-&#13;
geneity among the 8 pairs of groups cannot be rejected except in the distinc-&#13;
tion between single-parent/two-parent groups on the PSI score. The differen-&#13;
tial effects between these two groups hinge mainly on the enhanced effect of&#13;
maturation in the two-parent families, which also support positive labor force&#13;
participation and negative unemployment effects. In contrast, children in&#13;
single parent families seem to respond quite positively in their PSI perform-&#13;
ance to earned income and experimental transfer payments (the latter are&#13;
negatively associated with performance in the two parent families indicating&#13;
that the income effects of the payments are not sufficient to overcome whatever&#13;
other environmental effects may be associated with a family's receiving trails-&#13;
fer payments). 1/ The differential effect of earned income is also evident&#13;
among children having less well educated mothers as compared to children of&#13;
better educated mothers for whom there is no such positive earned income&#13;
effect.&#13;
One result consiptent through all the tests reported in Table 4,&#13;
including most of the sub-groups, is the negative effect of the change in&#13;
experimental transfer payments between 1972 and 1973. Experimental payments&#13;
were, by design, inversely related to earned income; but both earned income&#13;
and experimental payments increased on average between the two years in this&#13;
sample. Therefore this result presumably indicates that a child's acquisition&#13;
1/   This negative effect contrasts with positive relative effects of&#13;
experimental payments in facilitating beter performance on the Seguin&#13;
Form Board.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
of affective and/or cognitive traits is deferred by adverse economic circum-&#13;
stances which, in this sample at least, are proxied but not compensated by the&#13;
increased experimental payments, nor are effects of these circumstances&#13;
captured by declines in reported monthly earnings. 1/ It is also notable&#13;
that9 in general contrast to the Seguin results, these affective/cognitive&#13;
tests seem to reflect no significant productivity effects atributable to&#13;
mother's education. Demographic effects, birth order and spacing seem to play&#13;
a greater role, though their size is relatively small.&#13;
In general these cognitive/affective tests are significantly related&#13;
to the full sets of explanatory variables. The percentage of explained&#13;
variance ranges from 36% to 49% on the full sample scores0 These percentages&#13;
are somewhat lower for the non-zero response groups0 The standard errors&#13;
estimated for the various sub-groups are consistently lower only on the PSI&#13;
regressions0 On the other tests the standard errors of the groups display no&#13;
consistent pattern, though in some cases the variance explained within partic-&#13;
ular subgroups increases markedly0 For example, on the affective test scores&#13;
(BRN, GHP), the set of explanatory variables considered as a whole seems to&#13;
perform noticeably better in the two-parent and mother educated groups0 Only&#13;
on the role identification score does the whole set of variables perform best&#13;
on the group having less well educated mothers0&#13;
The outcome or ability measures reported in Table A5 are subtests of&#13;
the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, a widely used and&#13;
1/   This argument is based on an apparent reverse ratchet effect in that&#13;
increases in monthly earnings between 1972 and 1973 (which predominate&#13;
in this sample) do not have a significant positive effect on performance&#13;
but decreases in earnings which are picked up in increased experimental&#13;
transfer payments do have a significant negative impact on child&#13;
performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
"LeLiabie" IQ type test for young children.   Four subtests were used in this&#13;
testing program: (i) arithmetic, (ii) block design, (iii) comprehension and&#13;
(iv) picture completion. Since these four scales are normally considered a&#13;
only a part of the overall IQ measure and they tap quite different skills,&#13;
they are here analyzed separately. Also two different scores are reported:&#13;
(i) the average score for a particular subtest (columns 2-21 of Table A5) anl&#13;
(ii) the raw score (columns 22-41). In the administration of some WPPSI&#13;
subtests questioning stops after two succesive failures (arithmetic, block&#13;
design, picture completion), therefore the average score will not in general&#13;
pick up a more sustained performance. If answering more questions is syster-&#13;
atically related to any of the explanatory variables (such as age), this&#13;
should be reflected in the regression results on the raw scores. Tests wert-&#13;
also made on the non-zero response group of observations but in no case was&#13;
possible to reject the null hypothesis that the zero-response observations&#13;
were not significantly and differently related to the set of explanatory&#13;
variables.&#13;
Accross the full-sample results on all four sub-tests, test cond.&#13;
tions, child specific variables, and the change in monthly earned income a&#13;
consistently significant. In contrast to all other tests, these IQ relate&#13;
scores are consistently reduced as the WPPSI was given farther toward the&#13;
end of a sequence of tests. Interestingly, child's performance seems to&#13;
positively related to his birth order, a finding contrary to other studie&#13;
(see footnote 5). However, the child spacing variable performs as predic&#13;
with consistent negative effects of close spacing on all sub-test scores.&#13;
consistent income effect stems from the change in monthly average earned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72&#13;
income between 1972 and 19739 indicating that, at least for this low income&#13;
sample IQ is more affected by the growth or decline of income than by its&#13;
level. This suggests that expenditures on children or on goods affecting the&#13;
environment of children may enhance their performance and that such expend:lÂ°&#13;
tures are made out of an increases in income from relatively low levels (or9&#13;
Bquivalently9 that such expenditures are among the first to be sacrificed when&#13;
income falls)0 Finally on the block design component the presence of the&#13;
child in a single-parent family has a significant and large impact on his&#13;
performanceo As this is the one WPPSI component stressing visual-motor skiLlls9&#13;
a result consistent with the earlier Seguin test scores is reassuringo    This&#13;
general pattern of results is maintained among the raw scores with the addi-&#13;
tion of monthly earned income as a significant determinant on both comprehen-&#13;
sion and block design scores with each $100 of monthly earned income equivalent&#13;
to 5-6 months additional maturation and contributing 20% to 25% of a standard&#13;
deviation to the raw scores. It is also worth noting that maturation does&#13;
not contribute significantly to the arithmetic sub-test score (this is true&#13;
whether the average or raw scores are used)0 This may indicate a significEnt&#13;
innate component to mathematical abilities which behaves analogously to the&#13;
maturational components of other abilities0 If this be the case, it is&#13;
interesting to note that no other variable9 such as mother's education, seems&#13;
to serve as a proxy for this genetic effect0&#13;
Mother's status variables have (with the single exception noted&#13;
above) no significant impact on any of the sub-tests0 Thus it is not surpris-&#13;
ing that9 in general, the observations grouped by mother's education9 or&#13;
female family head, cannot be statistically distinguished from the pooled&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
observations. One exception is the high school/less-than-high school grouping&#13;
of the picture completion scores. In this case the two patterns of coeffi-&#13;
cients are quite different with single-parenthood enhancing the performance of&#13;
children of the better educated mothers (in contrast to other results reported&#13;
above). The child spacing and birth orders effects are also significantly&#13;
stronger in the two-parent families, while maturation seems to influence the&#13;
scores of children only in the single-parent families. The same single-parent&#13;
effect is very pronounced among children of better educated mothers on the&#13;
block design sub-test (on this test, the reciprocal effect of mother's high&#13;
school education on children in single parent families is also significant).&#13;
Why these two sources of mother's status should complement each other in&#13;
these instances when on other outcome measures they functioned as substitutes&#13;
has not yet been resolved.&#13;
Surveying the overall significance of the WPPSI regressions, it is&#13;
apparent that the explanatory power of the full set of variables is somewhat&#13;
less on these IQ related tests than on the affective/cognitive tests reported&#13;
in Table A4. However, only one regression (arithmetic raw scores) has an&#13;
F-value too low for rejection of the null hypothesis of no significant overall&#13;
relationship (not reported in Table 5). The standard error of estimates&#13;
within the groups of observations grouped by mother's high school education&#13;
are significantly lower (with correspondingly higher percentages of explained&#13;
variance). This tendency is more marked than on previous tests (probably&#13;
reflecting the interaction of single-parenthood and mother's education), while&#13;
in contrast to other tests, the set of variables treated here seems to explain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
more of the variance in WPPSI sub-test scores among children of single-parent&#13;
as opposed to two-parent families.&#13;
What conclusions may be drawn from this investigation of the produc-&#13;
tion of different abilities in young children?&#13;
The first and most basic point is that even within rather narrowly&#13;
defined socio-economic (poor to lower-middle income blacks) strata family&#13;
characteristics which can be statistically characterized do significantly&#13;
affect outcomes for pre-school children. The second point would seem to be&#13;
that the status of the mother does significantly affect the family's produc-&#13;
tivity in producing abilities in children. The status of the mother reflects&#13;
not just her educations but also her position as head or spouse within the&#13;
family and her participation within the labor force. Further, these three&#13;
factors and family income, both earned and unearned, interact in a rather&#13;
complex fashion. Controlling for these status variables, one may generalize&#13;
that family income has a significant impact on abilities in a sample of&#13;
predominantly low-income black American children0 There is some reason to&#13;
believe that for some abilities (perhaps including IQ and some affective&#13;
traits) the significance of income or changes in income dominates the effect&#13;
of mother's education at least within the ranges of income and education&#13;
covered by the present sample (incomes less than $15,000 a year and education&#13;
of high school or less)0 There is also evidence that income plays a more&#13;
significant role in families in which the mother is less well-educated0&#13;
Finally demographic effects are mixed: there does seem to be a general&#13;
detrimental effct to close child spacing on ability generation particular.Ly in&#13;
two-parent families or families having a relatively more educated mothero&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
However, there does not appear to be a consistent pattern to the effects of&#13;
birth order. It is worth noting that these child specific variables (includ-&#13;
ing age) do interact with mother's education and other measures of family&#13;
status. Thus test scores standardized by age, for example, may fail to&#13;
accurately reflect environmental influences.&#13;

            This paper explores on the basis of
            available data the role of various family characteristics in
            fostering abilities in pre-school children and the
            subsequent effect of ability on earnings. The paper is part
            of the Bank's effort to improve the understanding of
            the process of human capital development as a basic
            determinant of earnings. The results suggest that household
            income and the status of the mother are key predictors of
            abilities of pre-school children from disadvantaged backgrounds.
