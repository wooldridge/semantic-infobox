ABSTRACT&#13;
In an effort to understand the causes of poverty and its perpetu-&#13;
ation in an African rural economy, this study analysed household data from&#13;
the Rural Income DistrLbution Survey (RIDS) conducted in 1974-75 in&#13;
Botswana.&#13;
The Republic of Botswana is a 'Largely rural, land-locked, and&#13;
semi-nomadic nation located in Southern Africa.    It had an estimated popu-&#13;
lation of 1 million in 1983. About 85 percent of Botswana's population in&#13;
the mid seventies comprised rural households. bore than 50 percent of&#13;
these households were estimated to live below the Poverty Datum Line&#13;
established by the Government. This fact: underscored Botswana's unequal&#13;
income distribution; the wealthiest 10 percent received 50 percent of rural&#13;
incomes in the mid-1970s.&#13;
The findings of the study indicate substantial under- and&#13;
unemployment in the rural areas of Botswana at the time of the survey; work&#13;
in agriculture yielded low returns and employment opportunities outside the&#13;
rural economy were limited. Wage employmtent, largely male specific,&#13;
required out-migration primarily to mines in South Africa.&#13;
Animal husbandry provided the lion's share, 44 percent, of&#13;
average household income. Farming, although pursued with a relatively high&#13;
share of family labor, provided only an estimated 11 percent of income.&#13;
The marginal returns on working time particularly in activities of women&#13;
and children were relatively low. One impediment to improvement of&#13;
agricultural incomes was the relative unavailability of good cleared land&#13;
for farming. This situation affected adversely mostly female-headed&#13;
households because they had limited access to productive assets, including&#13;
cattle, and to wage employment.&#13;
Inspite of the immediate pressure on household incomes and&#13;
presumably on capital formation, large rural families appeared justified at&#13;
the household level; children provided security to the ill and the elderly,&#13;
and worked on and off the farm. This was one implication of a lack of a&#13;
widespread soc:Lal infrastructure in rural areas.&#13;
Low iLncomes, Limited wage employment, the scope for child labor,&#13;
and population movement, all combined to make schooling a costly and&#13;
unattractive exndeavor. Yet, it appeared to attract those who had a few&#13;
assets and, therefore, :Lncurred relatively low opportunity costs for&#13;
schooling. ThiLs turned out to be one way:, encouraged by the governments&#13;
abolition of tuition fees, to equalize opportunities in rural Botswana.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Improvement in the quality of life among Botswana s rural&#13;
population at the time of the survey, seemed to require raising the&#13;
relative returns to crop production, and generating wage employment in the&#13;
rural areas. Government policies deemedi necessary to provide capital&#13;
investments in rural industry, rural commerce, cooperatives, land&#13;
improvements (through rural credit and insurance), and so forth. In the&#13;
short run, such policies would raise the incomes and living standards of&#13;
the poor by provision of employment. The long run results might encourage&#13;
smaller families and better education of Botswanna's future generations.&#13;

CONDENSE&#13;
La presente etude a pour objeztif de cerner les causes de la&#13;
pauvrete et de sa perpetuation dans un pays africain a economie rurale.    A&#13;
cet effet, elle analyse les donnees concernant les menages fournies par&#13;
l'Enquete sur la r6partition du revenu rural, realisee au Botswana en&#13;
1974-75.&#13;
Le Botswana, Etat de l'Afrique australe, est un pays enclave,&#13;
dont l'econormie repose surtout sur l'agriculture et dont la population,&#13;
estimee en 1983 a 1 million d'habitants, est semi-nomadique. Vers le&#13;
milieu des ann6es 70, les menages ruraux representaient environ 85 % de la&#13;
population et plus de 50 % d'entre eux vivaient au-dessous du seuil de&#13;
pauvrete etabli par lea Gouvernement. A lui seul, ce fait mettait l'accent&#13;
sur le d6sequilibre de la repartition des revenus, puisque 10 % de la&#13;
population recevaient 50 2 des revenus ruraux.&#13;
Le; resultats de l'etude indiquent qu'a la date de l'enquete le&#13;
ch6mage et le sous-emploi s6vissaient dans les zones rurales du pays; la&#13;
rentabilite des travaux agricoles etait faible et les possibilites d'em-&#13;
plois en dehors de ce secteur etaient limit6es. Les emplois salaries,&#13;
pour la plupart des einplois masculins, iexigeaient l'emigration, princi-&#13;
palement vers les mines d'Afrique du Sud.&#13;
L'elevage, selon l'etude, procurait la plus grande part du&#13;
revenu moyen des menages : 44 %. L'agriculture, malgre le recours&#13;
intensif a la main-d'oeuvre familiale, n'en fournissait que 11 %.    La&#13;
rentabilite marginale du travail, particulierement des activites des&#13;
femmes et des enfants, 6tait comparativiement faible. La penurie de terres&#13;
arables et d6broussaiLlees, propices a :La culture, etait l'un des&#13;
obstacles a P'am6lioration du revenu agricole. La situation etait&#13;
particulierement critique dans les foye:rs dont le chef de famille etait&#13;
une femme, ces dernieres n'ayant qu'un acces limite aux avoirs productifs,&#13;
notamment b6tail, et A l'emploi salarie.&#13;
Pour le foyer rural, une famille nombreuse semblait justifi6e&#13;
malgre les pressions journalieres qu'un.grand nombre d'enfants exerce sur&#13;
le revenu du menage et sur la formation de capital; les enfants repr6-&#13;
sentant un e61ment de securite pour les parents en cas de maladie et&#13;
pendant leurs; vieux jours, et pouvant travailler aussi bien sur l'exploi-&#13;
tation qu'a L'ext6rieur, en l'absence d'une infrastructure sociale.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Le faible niveau des revenus, des possibilites d'emploi r6munere&#13;
limit6es, la generalisation du travail des enfants et les mouvements de&#13;
population faisaient de la scolarit6 une activite coateuse et peu&#13;
attrayante. Toutefois, ceux qui disposaient de quelques avoirs et pour&#13;
qui, par consequent, le coat d'opportunite de la scolarite etait compara-&#13;
tivement faible, semblaient s'y interesser, ce qui apparut comme un moyen&#13;
d'ameliorer les possibilites d'acces a l'education, d'autant que l'Etat,&#13;
pour encourager cet effort, a opte pour la gratuite de l'enseignement.&#13;
Il est apparu indispensable, pour am6liorer la qualit6 de la vie&#13;
de la population rurale du Botswana, d'aLccroitre la rentabilite de la&#13;
production agricole et de creer des emplois remuneres dans les zones&#13;
rurales. A cet effet, le Gouvernement a, juge qu'il 4tait necessaire de&#13;
fournir des biens d'equipement destin6s a l'industrie rurale, au commerce&#13;
rural, aux cooperatives, a l'amelioration des terres (par l'entremise de&#13;
credit et d'assurance agricoles), etc. A court terme, ces strategies&#13;
devraient permettre d'am6liorer le revenu et le niveau de vie des&#13;
populations pauvres en leur fournissant de l'emploi. A long terme, elles&#13;
pourraient encourager les familles a avoir moins d'enfants et promouvoir&#13;
un meilleur niveau d'education pour les futures generations.&#13;

EXTRACTO&#13;
Con el fin (le comprender las causas de la pobreza y su&#13;
perpetuaci6n en una economia rural de Airica, en este estudio se&#13;
analizaron los datos correspondientes a unidades"familiares tomados de la&#13;
Encuesta sobre Distribuci6n de los Ingresos Rurales realizada en 1974-75&#13;
en Botswana.&#13;
La Repuiblica de Botswana es una naci6n predominantemente rural,&#13;
mediterrinea y semin6made ubicada en el sur de Africa. En 1983, su&#13;
poblaci6n se estim6 en un mill6n de habitantes. A mediados del decenio de&#13;
1970, un 85% de ella estaba constituido por familias rurales, de las&#13;
cuales un 502 vivia, seguin las estimacicines, en condiciones inferiores a&#13;
la Linea de Referencia de Pobreza fijada por el Gobierno. Este hecho pone&#13;
de relieve la desigual. distribuci6n del ingreso en el pais; al 10% mais&#13;
rico le correspondia, en esa epoca, el 50% de los ingresos rurales.&#13;
Los resultados del estudio indican para esa fecha un sustancial&#13;
desempleo y subempleo en las zonas rurales de Botswana; el trabajo&#13;
agricola tenia rendimientos bajos y las oportunidades de empleo fuera de&#13;
la economia rural eran limitadas. Para obtener empleo asalariado,&#13;
principalmente en el caso de los hombres, era menester emigrar, casi&#13;
siempre a las minas de Sudafrica.&#13;
La cria de ganado constituia la parte principal (44%) del&#13;
ingreso familiar medio. Los cultivos, aunque se realizaban con una&#13;
participaci6n relativamente elevada de la mano de obra familiar,&#13;
proporcionaban unicamente un 11% estimado del ingreso. El rendimiento&#13;
marginal del tiempo de trabajo, en especial en las labores de mujeres y&#13;
ninios, era relativamente bajo. Un impedimento para la mejora de los&#13;
ingresos agricolas era la falta relativa de tierras despejadas, buenas&#13;
para cultivar. Esta situaci6n afectaba adversamente a la mayoria de las&#13;
familias encabezadas por una mujer porque tenian acceso limitado a los&#13;
activos productivos, incluido el ganado, y al empleo asalariado.&#13;
A p-esar de la presi6n inmediata en el ingreso familiar, y&#13;
supuestamente en la formaci6n de capital, las familias rurales grandes&#13;
parecian justificadas a nivel de la unidad familiar; los hijos&#13;
proporcionaban seguridad a los enfermos y los ancianos y trabajaban dentro&#13;
y fuera de la explotaci6n. Era un corolario de la falta de una&#13;
infraestructura social generalizada en lias zonas rurales.&#13;
Los bajos ingresos, el limitado empleo asalariado, las&#13;
posibilidades de trabajo infantil y el movimiento de la poblaci6n se&#13;
combinaban pa;ra que la asistencia a la escuela resultara costosa y poco&#13;
atractiva. No obstante, aparentemente atraia a los que poseian unos pocos&#13;
activos ya que les significaba costos de oportunidad relativamente bajos.&#13;
Esta result6 una forma de igualar las oportunidades en el sector rural de&#13;
Botswana, alentada por la eliminaci6n de los derechos de matricula&#13;
decidida por el Gobierno.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
La mejora de la calidad de la vida de la poblaci6n rural de&#13;
Botswana en la epoca en que se realiz6 el estudio parecia requerir el&#13;
aumento de los rendimientos relativos de la producci6n de cultivos y la&#13;
generaci6n de empleo asalariado en las zonas rurales. En las politicas&#13;
oficiales se consider6 necesario proporcionar inversiones de capital para&#13;
la industria y el comercio rurales, las cooperativas, la mejora de las&#13;
tierras (mediante cr6dito rural y seguros), entre otras cosas. A corto&#13;
plazo, dichas politicas aumentarian los ingresos y los niveles de vida de&#13;
los pobres al suministrarles empleo. A largo plazo, los resultados&#13;
podrian alentar la formaci6n de familias mas pequeiias y una mejor&#13;
educaci6n para las futuras generaciones.&#13;

PREFACE&#13;
This volume constitutes the second large scale publication based&#13;
on the Botswana Rural Income Distribution Survey, commonly known by&#13;
its acronym RIDS. The first volume published in 1976 by the Central&#13;
Statistics Office of the Republic of Botswana, The Rural Income Distri-&#13;
bution Survey in Botswana (1974/5), summarizes extensively the events&#13;
surrounding the survey and leading up to the initial report. It in-&#13;
cludes data on survey design, maps, sampling procedures and related&#13;
information, as well as a series of analyses of income in Botswana.&#13;
After the first publication, further analysis of the data seemed&#13;
warranted as RIDS pro-vides a wealth of unexplored data that portray&#13;
economic life in rural Botswana and in Southern Africa in general.&#13;
Furthermore, many facets of economic life in Botswana covered by the&#13;
survey are not scheduled to be resurveyied in the near future.&#13;
This need was answered by a World Bank research program culminating&#13;
in the present volume. Socio-economic issues such as allocation of&#13;
family resources, agricultural production, wage employment, schooling&#13;
and fertility behavior, are studied froin the perspective of the house-&#13;
hold economy. The study is based on time use data-- the scope and&#13;
detail of wh:Lch are unprecedented at least in African studies.&#13;
This volume is organized into eight chapters dealing with the socio-&#13;
economic issues mentioned.  The first chapter is an introduction to&#13;
Botswana, its economy and the economic :Lssues underlying the studies&#13;
which follow.  The second chapter presents the conceptual framework&#13;
within which the data are examined and l:he studies are organized. Six&#13;
chapters follow, deal:Lng with allocation of time, crop production, wage&#13;
employment, schooling and fertility behavior, and conclusions from the&#13;
study.&#13;
The various chapters were written by different authors. An attempt&#13;
has been made to strike a balance between a set of independent essays&#13;
and an integrated volume. Furthermore, although they deal with compli-&#13;
cated conceptual issues, the chapters have been written with wide reader-&#13;
ship in mind.&#13;
Many should share any credit related/to RIDS. Special acknowledgment&#13;
must be made to Dr. Derek Hudson, whose dedication and desire for per-&#13;
fection led to one of the most successful household surveys. He was&#13;
institutionally and technically supported by Mr. P. Nteta, the former&#13;
Botswana Government Statistician, and by Mr. C. Norrlof and numerous&#13;
interviewers in the field.&#13;
The support for RIDS-related research on behalf of the Government of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Botswana was extended throughout the research program by the current&#13;
Government Statistician, Mr. F. Modise.&#13;
Many other people have made their contributions to the project&#13;
through technical and moral support, as well as through their research.&#13;
We would like to acknowledge the support of the World Bank staff, T. King,&#13;
R. Gulhati, M. C. Thalwitz, D. N. JordaLn, C. B. Boucher, as well as a&#13;
group of researchers who used RIDS dataL and enhanced our studies-- most&#13;
notably H. E. Dahl, C. Colclough, P. Fallon, C. Molomo, C. Smith (Allison),&#13;
and R. Szal.&#13;
We are especially grateful to Ms. F. Cartford for organizing and&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
SUMMARY&#13;
The studies in this volume use the data of Botswana Rural Income&#13;
Distribution Survey (RIDS) to portray the micro-economic aspects of house-&#13;
hold behavior of the traditional semi-nomadic people of rural Botswana.&#13;
The prime objective of these studies has been to identify and quantify the&#13;
obstacles to imaprovement in standards of 'Living and income distribution in&#13;
southern Africa. In par-ticular we have looked at factors which limit the&#13;
growth of household incomes, employment and productivity. Further, we have&#13;
looked at constraints on the improvements of standards of living over time&#13;
by reduction in family size and better education for children.    By the&#13;
means of these studies we hope to convey some understanding of circum-&#13;
stances which perpetuate rural poverty or limit sustained rural development&#13;
in southern Africa.&#13;
The Republic of Botswana, situated in southern Africa, is a&#13;
landlocked nation of 580,000 square kilometers with a population of about&#13;
one million in 1984. Because of its relatively low population density,&#13;
Botswana fits a common and general perception of Africa as an "empty land."&#13;
As for many other Sub-Saharan countries this perception may be erroneous,&#13;
however, once other productive resources are considered.&#13;
Shortage of water is the most striking reality of Botswana.&#13;
Rainfall is erratic in timing of onset and amount, and there is a very&#13;
little surface water. Availability of water and the fertility of the soils&#13;
in the different regions of the country, largely dominated by the Kalahari&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
desert, have established the patterns of human settlement. More than&#13;
eighty percent of the population is concentrated along the eastern side of&#13;
the country.&#13;
Most people depend on subsistence agriculture (sorghum and maize)&#13;
and cattle husbandry as prime means of livelihood. More than half the&#13;
population reside in villages with populations of less than five hundred.&#13;
Concentration of people in large villages that range in size up to 40,000&#13;
is mostly seasonal. People divide theLr time between distant cattle posts,&#13;
lands, and village dwelling.&#13;
Since its independence in 1966, Botswana has demonstrated a most&#13;
remarkable economic growth. Up to 1980, GDP expanded about 13 percent a&#13;
year.  Botswana's economic growth has been marked by a structural shift of&#13;
the economy. The mining sector replaced agriculture as a major sector by&#13;
the end of the seventies. Mining has made Botswana less dependent on&#13;
weather conditions and disease prone livestock, and to an extent has&#13;
reduced its dependency upon foreign financial assistance. Of course, it&#13;
made Botswana more dependent on prices of diamonds and copper.&#13;
Botswana's rapid economic growth has nonetheless created a range&#13;
of interrelated socio-economic problems mostly related to the reliance of&#13;
the economy on a narrow production base characterized by capital intensive&#13;
cattle production and mining. These problems include unemployment in both&#13;
urban and rural areas, and a deteriorating income distribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
According to RIDS data the average household in rural Botswana&#13;
receives income from five to six sources, and this pattern of multiple&#13;
income generating activities is common to all income groups. The largest&#13;
single source of income in rural Botswana is animal husbandry, primarily&#13;
cattle raising, but also small stock such as'goats, sheep, pigs, and&#13;
poultry. Other significant sources of income are crop cultivation, wage&#13;
employment and transfers, including remittances from mine workers in South&#13;
Africa, urban residents, and relatives in other rural areas.&#13;
A comparison between the median per capita income and the Poverty&#13;
Datum Line (PDL) for rural areas reveals that more than 50 percent of the&#13;
households of flive or more persons lived below the PDL established at the&#13;
time of the suIvey.&#13;
The RIDS data point to substantial underemployment of the labor&#13;
force, a logical consequence of low labor productivity.&#13;
Mueller presents a thorough analysis of how people allocate their&#13;
time. Time spent on income earning activities appears strongly influenced&#13;
by economic endowments. Households with low levels of assets and human&#13;
capital produce lower economic returns on their time and thus are seen to&#13;
work less. Animal husbandry and wage labor yield much more income per unit&#13;
of time input t'han do other economic pursuits. Crop cultivation is a&#13;
particularly unrewarding activity, probably because of Botswana's arid&#13;
climate and the relatively small capital inputs into this activity. Due to&#13;
economic circumstances aFnd tradition, households headed by women own less&#13;
cattle to use for draught power and for accumulation of wealth. Hence&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
these households are relatively worse than others. Labor utilization is&#13;
also low in those male-headed households which are too poor to own cattle.&#13;
The agricultural sector of Botswana generates insufficient&#13;
employment for its labor force, although some agricultural work is pursued&#13;
to the point of very low marginal productivity. There is relatively little&#13;
crop work and wage employment. During most seasons of the year there is an&#13;
apparent "abundance" of leisure time. In fact, most wage employment in&#13;
rural Botswana is in non-agricultural pursuits.&#13;
Lucas has found that the rural wage labor market appears as a&#13;
dual labor market; there exists a higlher wage market which is protected by&#13;
government wage-setting policies and encompasses an elite of privileged&#13;
workers, and an "informal" market. The latter probably closely reflects&#13;
the opportunity costs of labor, that, according to Mueller, are&#13;
substantially lower than the prevailing rural wage. However, even this&#13;
informal wage labor market does not offer sufficient work opportunities to&#13;
the poor to break the linkage between low asset holdings and low income.&#13;
As in many other instances, government minimum wage policies do not improve&#13;
the situation, and may, in fact, be an obstacle to more employment in rural&#13;
areas.&#13;
The need for employment and income creation in rural areas of&#13;
Botswana implies that productive resources other than unskilled labor,&#13;
must be greatly increased. The resources in question include infrastruc-&#13;
ture such as irrigation, land improvement, rural roads, electricity,&#13;
fencing, agricultural extension and research, and marketing facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
They also include investments in human capital and rural credit.&#13;
Otherwise, only those who have access to mine work in South Africa are able&#13;
to form some of their own capital.&#13;
This conclusion is derived from Lucas's estimates concerning&#13;
agricultural productivity. He estimates a fairly high average product for&#13;
land and infers that land -- or more precisely good, cleared land -- is not&#13;
freely available. The chief competitor for land is cattle grazing; it is&#13;
also true that overgrazing is a serious ecological and economic problem.&#13;
Absorption of labor in crop production of the growing group of young job&#13;
seekers -- enlarged by the population growth and declining availability of&#13;
jobs in South Africa -is doubtful.      While the presence of more men could&#13;
raise crop output, it could do so, Lucas' analysis indicates, only with&#13;
greater use of other inputs, especially if no additional land were&#13;
allocaterd to crop production.&#13;
Given the shortage of productive assets other than cattle (which&#13;
is in many ways subsidized), it is necessary to make the diversification of&#13;
assets attractive to the farm population. This objective implies that&#13;
people must be made acquainted with the advantages of alternative assets,&#13;
that they be given access to financing, and-that these assets provide&#13;
earnings, security and/or prestige. Examples of such might be farm and&#13;
business equipment, land improvements, cooperative shares, better housing,&#13;
or a secondary education for their children.&#13;
A further problem is that the absorptive capacity of the&#13;
agricultural sector, is limited by the shortage of trained personnel&#13;
particularly wLth vocational skill. The shortage of educated people,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
especially those educated beyond primary school, severely limits the amount&#13;
of experimentation with development programs that is feasible, and the&#13;
amount of flexibility permitted in administering programs.&#13;
Nonetheless, inspite of the implied high social benefits from&#13;
education, the private cost-benefit equation associated with schooling, may&#13;
have quite a different implication than what the social benefits would&#13;
imply.   Chernichovsky shows that children in rural Botswana play an&#13;
important role in the household economy. Hence, in spite of their low&#13;
marginal productivity, children's contribution to work (especially animal&#13;
herding) and housework, raises the cost of education. The limited oppor-&#13;
tunities in the wage labor market for primary school leavers make for low&#13;
returns to education. Wage employment in South African mines do not&#13;
require schooling. High drop-out rates suggest that parents and children&#13;
are not fully persuaded of the benefits of education. The data suggest&#13;
that controlling for other factors, children are most likely to attend&#13;
school when their families can financially afford it, when their parents&#13;
are educated, and when demands on children's time for economic work and&#13;
household chores are not too high.&#13;
It appears that the eudcational system in Botswana will have to&#13;
become more employment and vocationally oriented, so that parents&#13;
anticipate a return to education other than an uncertain chance of some&#13;
kind of urban employment. Educational planning will have to get around the&#13;
obstacles to school attendance that result from demands on children's time&#13;
on the farm and in the household. Schools will have to exploit periods of&#13;
slack demand for children's work and tailor facilities more closely to the&#13;
geographic location of the school age population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Women play an important role in production in Botswana with crop&#13;
cultivation largely a woman's activity. Moreover, about 30 percent of&#13;
households in Botswana are either permanently, or for lengthy periods,&#13;
headed by females.    Thus the training of women and the creation of employ-&#13;
ment opportunities for women,, are essentLal aspects of the upgrading of&#13;
human capital in rural areas.&#13;
We have argued that the major objective for the rural sector must&#13;
be the achievement of a rate of growth oi productive capital which substan-&#13;
tially exceeds the rate of growth of the labor force. It remains to&#13;
consider the possibility of slowing down population growth, and thereby&#13;
labor force growth. An effective family planning program would be valuable&#13;
component of a package of policies relating to rural development. They&#13;
need to be complemented., however, by policies which reduce people's&#13;
perceived need for children, because children play a significant role in&#13;
providing assistance of various kinds, particularly to single women and to&#13;
ill or elderly parents. Chernichovsky's work suggests that the security&#13;
motive is a major reason for high levels of desired fertility in rural&#13;
Botswana, in spite of the economic strain, in time and resources, childcare&#13;
impose.&#13;
Indeed, parents who can afford relatively more children have&#13;
higher levels of fertilLty. This behavior is counteracted to a degree by&#13;
higher levels of motheris' education among the well-to-do. Our findings&#13;
suggest that programs to enhance female education and female earning oppor-&#13;
tunities (but not children's employment) could contribute to fertility&#13;
reduction. Programs to provide some minimal security for the aged would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
serve the same purpose. Such programs of course have justification in&#13;
their own right.&#13;
In summary, from the household perspective, raising the relative&#13;
returns to crop production and generating wage employment in rural&#13;
industries, as opposed to fostering cattle rearing, appear fundamental&#13;
policy strategies for improving income distribution and economic welfare in&#13;
rural Botswana.   In the short run, such policies would raise the level of&#13;
living and the security of the poor by provision of employment. In the&#13;
long run, they might encourage smaller families and better educated people&#13;
among Botswana's future generations.&#13;

Chapter 1: Introduction&#13;
1.1 The Setting&#13;
The Republic of ]3otswana is situated in Southern Africa.  A large&#13;
landlocked natiorn, it is bordered by Zambia in the north, by Zimbawe in the&#13;
east, by South Africa in the south, and by Namibia in the west.   Botswana is a&#13;
large plateau, 1000 meters above sea level which is mostly a shallow   sand-&#13;
filled basin with limited rainfall.&#13;
Three distinct ecological zones typify Botswana's 580,000 square&#13;
kilometers. The first is the catchment area of the Limpopo River in the&#13;
eastern part of the country. While lacking rich soil and a reliable rainfall&#13;
relative to the terrain in the other two areas, the land allows for some dry-&#13;
land crops and cattle-raisiing. The second ecological zone, the Okavango&#13;
Delta, is a swampland of 15,000 square kilometers in the northwestern region&#13;
of the country. Here wildlife abounds, but the land is not arable on a&#13;
regular basis. The third zone, covering about two thirds of the country, is&#13;
the semi-arid Kgalagadi (Xalahari) desert. Extending well into South Africa&#13;
and Namibia, this vast area occupies the central and southwestern areas of the&#13;
country. With a sparse covering of grass, acacia bush and small trees, this&#13;
area is suitable for closely controlled cattle-grazing. Hitherto, the dire&#13;
shortage of water has inhibited full exploitation of its potential.&#13;
Shortage of water is the most striking reality of Botswana. The&#13;
long-term average rainfall is about 530 mm annually, with drought occurring in&#13;
about four in ten years. Rainfall is erratic in timing of onset and amount,&#13;
and there is very little surface water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
Availability of water and the fertility of the soils in the different&#13;
ecological zones have dominated the patterns of human settlement. More than&#13;
eighty percent of the population, estimated at 1.04 million in 1985, is&#13;
concentrated in the first ecological zone, along the eastern side of the&#13;
country. This region, which consists of 30,000 square kilometers and is less&#13;
than one tenth of the land area, enjoys relatively favorable conditions:&#13;
reasonably fertile soils, and in most years sufficient rainfall to produce&#13;
good pasture for cattle and to permit arable agriculture to be pursued.&#13;
In this predominantly rural nation, most people depend on subsistence&#13;
agriculture (sorghum and maize) and cattle husbandry as a means of&#13;
livelihood. More than half of the people reside in villages with populations&#13;
of less than five hundred. Concentratio,n of people in large villages that&#13;
range in size up to 40,000 is mostly seasonal. People divide their time&#13;
between distant cattle posts, lands and village dwelling. They move their&#13;
cattle herds in search of grazing grounds and water during part of the year;&#13;
and during the rest they cultivate their lands, returning to the villages for&#13;
rest and festivities.&#13;
While the arid conditions and scarcity of water do not allow plant&#13;
production to prosper significantly, cattle grazing is more drought&#13;
resistant. Crops may fail with poor rainfall; at the same time, a herd of&#13;
cattle is likely to survive the fragile desert conditions. Thus, there is a&#13;
tendency to emphasize the importance of cattle and to increase herd size when&#13;
possible. Size of cattle herds have consequently become a measure of wealth&#13;
as well as of social prestige and political power. A system of cattle tenancy&#13;
(mafisa) enables poor farmers to raise herds of wealthy owners whereby they&#13;
can receive in return the milk and milk products of the herd as well as the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
meat of fallen cattle.   In addition, the poor farmers can keep some of the&#13;
offspring born during the grazing tenure, and thus they have some potential of&#13;
developing a herd of their own.&#13;
Botswana's population comprises eight major tribes. The largest&#13;
tribe is the Ngwats and the smallest is the Masarwa known as the Bushmen,&#13;
representing the early stages of man's technological development.   This&#13;
population grows at an annual rate of about 3 percent.&#13;
Until Independence in 1966 the popllation had been almost entirely&#13;
dependent upon cattle rearing, subsistence production, and remittances from&#13;
migrant laborers in South Africa. About one-third of the Botswana male&#13;
population still make theiLr living by working in the mines and on the farms of&#13;
South Africa.&#13;
By 1978, some 15 percent of the population were living in the urban&#13;
centers, and this proporti.on has been increasing rapidly at about 12 percent&#13;
annually. The town of Gaborone, the largest: in Botswana with a population of&#13;
40,000, hosts government facilities and serves as an administration center for&#13;
the local industry. Lobal:se, another smaller modern urban center in the&#13;
southeast provides facilities for the meat industry. Francistown in the&#13;
northeast has a variety of industries and ccmmercial activities.&#13;
Largely as a result of mineral discoveries in 1973-74, two new towns&#13;
have become important centers:   Orapa, where! one of the world's largest&#13;
diamond pipes has been opened, and Selbi-pikwe where major copper and nickel&#13;
deposits were discovered. These deveLopments have helped generate broad&#13;
improvements in the infrastructure and consequently in job opportunities for&#13;
the population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
Rapid urbanization in Botswana creates as many problems as it may try&#13;
to solve. As elsewhere, phenomena associated with rapid urbanization&#13;
prevail: overcrowding, inadequate sanitary conditions and lack of social&#13;
services.&#13;
The focus of this book is, however, the rural economy where the&#13;
majority of the Botswana people live, and to which the Rural Income&#13;
Distribution Survey (RIDS) was confined.&#13;
1.2 The Economy&#13;
Botswana was declared a British protectorate in 1861. It became an&#13;
independent republic under the presidency of the late Sir Seretse Khama in&#13;
1966. Under British rule, the Botswana economy was by and large neglected.1&#13;
The British assumed that the country would eventually be incorporated into&#13;
South Africa, and therefore never attempted to develop an internally&#13;
prosperous society. They left in their wake an uneducated, unskilled and poor&#13;
population, with a subsistence economy, largely dependent on migrant labor in&#13;
the mines of South Africa.&#13;
With Independence, a concentrated effort was made to develop the&#13;
country's economy.2 A key element of this effort has been Botswana's desire&#13;
to reduce its economic dependence on South Africa through diversification of&#13;

presented in 1980 at the African Studies Association in Philadelphia.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the economy with multi- and bilateral technical and financial assistance.3&#13;
The country wenit through a series of custonn agreements with South Africa&#13;
within the Soutih African Customs Union (SACWO) and established its own&#13;
monetary system.&#13;
Since its indepesndence Botswana has demonstrated a most remarkable&#13;
economic growth. Official statistics put ithe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at&#13;
current market lprices at about 660 Pula per capita in 1978/79.4 This figure&#13;
represents an eiLghtfold Lncrease since 1961;.&#13;
Botswana' s economic growth is marlced by a structural shift of the&#13;
economy as well. The miniing sector replaced agriculture as a major sector by&#13;
the end of the seventies. In 1978/9, mining accounted for about 23 percent of&#13;
the GDP, as compared withl the 16 percent share of agriculture. The former&#13;
sector accountecl for only 63 percent of the GPD at the time of Independence.&#13;
Mining has made Botswana less dependent on weather conditions and&#13;
disease prone livestock, and to an extent has reduced its dependency upon&#13;
foreign financial assistance. Since the early seventies Botswana has started&#13;
to accumulate foreign resierves, mostly frcai its foreign trade surplus and&#13;
revenues from the South African Customs Union agreement. Although&#13;
substantially relieved fron financial constraints on economic development, a&#13;

4 The currency of Botswana at that period was the South African Rand&#13;
(=$1.41). We adlopt here the common approach of expressing all values&#13;
in Botswana current currency, the Pula. For this and related&#13;
statistics the reader is referred to the Statistical Bulleti;&#13;
published quarterly by Botswana's Central Statistic Office.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
major impediment to Botswana's econamic development has been the severe lack&#13;
of human capital or skilled labor.&#13;
1.3 The Rural Economy and Rural Poverty&#13;
Botswana's rapid economic growth has created a range of interrelated&#13;
socio-economic problems mostly related to the reliance of the economy on a&#13;
narrow production base characterized by capital intensive cattle production&#13;
and mining. These problems include unemployment in both urban and rural&#13;
areas, and a deteriorating income distribution. 5 Attempts to develop modern&#13;
labor-intensive crop production in rural areas to alleviate these problems&#13;
have not produced any significant results as of yet.&#13;
The size of the rural sector in the economy is measured by its share&#13;
in the Gross Domestic Product. Official statistics originally valued the GDP&#13;
(in current prices) at 205.7 million Pula for the period 1974-75. 6 Thirty&#13;
seven percent of this value, or 76 million Pula, was the rural value added.&#13;
Based on RIDS data the rural contribution to the GDP was adjusted to 91.9&#13;
million Pula -- 21 percent above the original value.7&#13;
Table 1.1 presents some key economic characteristics of the rural&#13;
economy as calculated from RIDS data. The income data include income in-cash&#13;

and kind, but exclude inputed housing benefits.   The largest single source of&#13;
income in rural Botswana is animal husbandry, primarily cattle raising, but&#13;
also small stock such as goats, sheep, pigs, and poultry. Other significant&#13;
sources of income are crop cultivation, wage employment and transfers,&#13;
including remittances from mine workers, trban residents, and relatives in&#13;
other rural areas.  In addition, there are a number of minor sources of income&#13;
such as gathering wild food and fuel, hunting, manufacturing (largely food&#13;
processing and crafts), trading and vendirg, construction and services.&#13;
Together, these minor sources account for less than 15 percent of rural&#13;
income.&#13;
The second column of Table 1.1 presents figures showing the frequency&#13;
with which various sources of income were reported by households. The average&#13;
household in rural Botswana receives income from five to six sources and this&#13;
pattern of multiple income generating activities is similar for all income&#13;
groups. About nine out of ten households reported income from crop&#13;
cultivation and animal husbandry. These frequencies somewhat exceed the&#13;
frequency of land and animal ownership, indicating that among the poorer&#13;
sections of the population some of this income is earned from helping&#13;
others.  Transfer incomes, and income from food gathering are also received by&#13;
almost all hous,eholds.&#13;
The proportion of gross income obtained in kind from each source is&#13;
shown in the third column of Table 1.1. Agricultural income from crop&#13;
production and animal husbandry is received in the form of cash.   In the lower&#13;
income groups, lhowever, both wages and transfers are more likely to be in&#13;
kind. Overall, it is clear that the largest part of rural production is for&#13;
household use or is exchanged in kind.&#13;

rural areas. Income from cattle is included in cattle income; income from&#13;

The distribution of income earning time among economic activities is&#13;
shown in column 4. A comparison of this column with column 1 is instruc-&#13;
tive. It discloses substantial disparities between time inputs into various&#13;
activities and income earned from these activities. Animal husbandry and wage&#13;
labor yield much more income per unit of time input than do other economic&#13;
pursuits. Crop cultivation is a particularly unrewarding activity, probably&#13;
because of Botswana' s arid climate and the small capital inputs into this&#13;
activity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Several points emerge from these data. First, most rural households&#13;
piece together a living by engaging in a variety of income earning activities&#13;
rather than specializing in one or two. Second, almost all households must be&#13;
fairly self-sufficient. They raise at least part of their own food or obtain&#13;
it by helping other households with agricultural activities. They also obtain&#13;
some of their food and fuel by hunting and gathering. Third, receipts of&#13;
gifts and other transfer income are very widespread, suggesting widespread&#13;
reciprocity rather than a unidirectional pattern of transfers exclusively from&#13;
better off to poorer households.&#13;
The ruiral income distribution is presented in Table 1.20 8 On the&#13;
basis of this dLstribution, the Gini coefficient, indicating the inequality of&#13;
income distribution, is 0.60, According to the data, the wealthiest 10&#13;
percent of the households received above 50 percent of total rural incomes in&#13;

revised on the basis of a consensus that the upper income groups were&#13;
seriousEly under-represented in the initial estimates. The new Gini&#13;
coefficient was estimated by applying higher weights, as suggested by&#13;
the CSO and Banb of Botswana officials, to the upper income groups&#13;
(stratum 23). Actual estimates were not undertaken because the&#13;

needs, given household size and composition - was set at an income of $76 per&#13;
capita.10 Table 1.3 presents figure showing that although total household&#13;
income increased with household size, income per capita decreases for larger&#13;
households. A comparison between the median per capita income and the PDL for&#13;

1.4 Policy and Research Issues&#13;
The Goverment of Botswana has sought to improve rural inctmes and to&#13;
alleviate poverty through diversification of the economy and creation of&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
employment.12 Policy in this direction has become increasingly important in&#13;
view of the excess supply of Botswana males wishing to go to the mines in&#13;
South Africa in search of work. Development programs were geared at creation&#13;
and expansion of labor intensive activities. The Arable Lands Development&#13;
Programme launched in 1975 (ALDEP) is the best example of a policy program in&#13;
this direction.&#13;
The purpose of this and similar programs is twofold: a) the creation&#13;
of work opportunities and an increase of rural incomes, and b) self-&#13;
sufficiency for Botswana in food production, particularly grain.&#13;
At the same time, the Government of Botswana has developed a network&#13;
of social welfare activities; providing food, particularly in drought striken&#13;
areas, raising the peoples' level of education, and bettering the population's&#13;
health.&#13;
In view of the very general characterization of Botswana's social and&#13;
economic policy, this research program strived for a better understanding of&#13;
how Botswana's rural economy operates, and what people do to earn their&#13;
livelihood. Particular attention was given to an examination of the&#13;
impediments to achievement of higher and more equally distributed incomes, to&#13;
universal schooling, and to achievement of smaller and presumably better-off&#13;
families.&#13;
From a-more specific policy perspactive, a few major issues could&#13;
possibly be addressed with the data:&#13;

(A) The degree to which labor is underutilized, and the extent to which&#13;
labor utilization depends on other inputs as well as on the&#13;
individual's and household's demographic and socio-economic&#13;
characteristics;&#13;
(B)  The nature of income generation in rural Botswana, with particular&#13;
attention paid to crop production and wage employment;&#13;
(C) The extent to which school enrollment and attendance depends on&#13;
household characteristics and interferes with economic activities;&#13;
(D) The dependence of fertility behavior and thus family size on the&#13;
mothers' and the households' characteristics.&#13;
These issues are examined in the following six chapters. In the next&#13;
chapter, we present the conceptual framework on the basis of which the various&#13;
studies are organized. It deals with the basic functional and structural&#13;
relationships being explored by the study, and serves as the basis for the&#13;
hypotheses tested in the chapters that follow.&#13;
Chapter 3 by Eva Mueller deals with the household's allocation of its&#13;
prime asset, time. This issue is crucial to the study of patterns of&#13;
employment and the possibility of their change. For the first time in the&#13;
African context an attempt is made to establish, on a large scale, the&#13;
correlates of time use by household members in various households of different&#13;
socio-economic strata. We learn about the distribution of time to income&#13;
earning activities, including wage employment, to household chores, including&#13;
raising children, to schooling, and leisure.&#13;
Mueller's essay is followed by two chapters by R. E. Lucas that focus&#13;
on two major income generating activities: crop production and wage&#13;
employment.  The first, Chapter 4, deals with the determinants of crop&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

production and thereby deEines the parameters which are crucial to its spread&#13;
throughout Botswana.  The chapter on wage employment, Chapter 5, deals with&#13;
the rural labor market an, the consequences of schooling for usage labor. It&#13;
delineates, on the one hand, the tenuous nature of the rural labor market, and&#13;
on the other, tha importance and relevance of skill in this market, and how&#13;
education contrilbutes to gainful employment.&#13;
The sixith chapter builds on the previous chapter through discussing&#13;
the market benefits of schooling. In this chapter, Dov Chernichovsky deals&#13;
with the determinants of school enrollment and attendance. Its main focus is&#13;
identification of the factors inhibiting sclhooling which is the major means of&#13;
social mobility in rural Botswana.&#13;
Correlates of fertility behavior are examined in the last chapter,&#13;
Chapter 7. This behavior is of course a major determinant of family size and&#13;
as outlined in earlier sections, is an important aspect of poverty and family&#13;
welfare. Chernichovsky examines the motives underlying particular levels of&#13;
fertility.&#13;

Chapter 2: Aspects of Household Behavior in Rural Botswana:&#13;
Conceptual Considerations and Framework&#13;
2.1 Introduction&#13;
The data from the Rural Income Distribution Survey (RIDS) underscored&#13;
many of the prior notions concerning economic life in rural Botswana. It is&#13;
the typical traditional rural settirLg of a semi-nomadic population. People&#13;
earn most of their income from self-*employment. A variety of economic&#13;
activities in different locations comprise the.household enter- prises in&#13;
which people engage to generate the major part of their means of&#13;
subsistence. In this way, households also spread the risk associated with&#13;
particular sources of income. The division. of labor by age and sex is fairly&#13;
delineated, assuring that work is shared by all able household members. Wage&#13;
employment is limited, the prime source being the mines of South Africa where&#13;
many of the young and able males spend a substantial part of the year.1&#13;
The objective of this chapter is to outline the considerations and&#13;
framework structuring the various essays comprising this volume. First, we&#13;
broadly delineate the unit of analysis - the household - and its economic&#13;
environment. Then, we attempt to identify, from an economic perspective,&#13;
factors which stimulate particular household behavior and thereby determine&#13;
the levels of particular "outcomes" which they produce. The main behavior&#13;

examined is the allocation of time to activities which are assumed to enhance&#13;
household welfare. The outcomes considered are different aspects of household&#13;
income, schooling, and fertility.2&#13;
This chapter serves a few interrelated purposes. First, it states&#13;
the simplifying assumptions underlying our approach. Secondly, it is used to&#13;
identify the relationships which are believed to be relevant to the household&#13;
economy and which can be studied with the data. Thirdly, although not&#13;
formally derived here, it provides the general framework within which these&#13;
basic hypotheses are tested. Fourthly, this framework serves as an&#13;
organizational tool according to which the various topics are addressed.&#13;
The following sections of this chapter are concerned with the&#13;
economic environment pertinent to our subject, the unit of analysis, and the&#13;
processes of household production.&#13;
2.2 The Economic Environment&#13;
The labor market where individuals buy and sell labor for wages, and&#13;
the capital market where households or individuals buy and sell capital&#13;
services, are crucial aspects in the study of economic behavior.&#13;
As shown by the data presented in the previous chapter, opportunities&#13;
to earn wages in rural Botswana are dismal. Our data indicate that there is&#13;
almost no labor market for young people under 18-20 years of age, and there is&#13;
persistent evidence that the country is stricken by under employment and&#13;
2   The notion of "behavior" and "behavioral outcomes" are rather arbitrary.&#13;
As discussed in a section which follows, lines of causality are&#13;
complex and, as a consequence, cause and effect or "behavior" and&#13;
''outcome" are often a matter of assumption.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

unemployment.3 One segment of the labor market is the mines of South&#13;
Africa.  However, as pointed out already, data concerning the decision to&#13;
become a migrant: worker, as well as data oni remittances, is scanty and could&#13;
not be considered useful for our analysis. Under these circumstances, an&#13;
assumption which is common in economic studies, that of "free" movement into&#13;
and out of the wage labor force at all times, has been unrealistic here. This&#13;
means that for some minimum "reservation wage" or institutional wage, some&#13;
individuals cannot find employment :Ln the wage labor market.&#13;
A few other matt:ers which complicate the employment issue must be&#13;
considered. Sea.sonality is a crucial factor in agricultural production in&#13;
Botswana. Many may be busy during the peak season; may even leave other jobs&#13;
in favor of their own agricultural activities during this time; and yet may&#13;
sit "idle" during other periods. Hence, any notions concerning "labor&#13;
surplus" must take this factor into account. Traditional and institutional&#13;
constraints are significant in Botswana. There is a fairly delineated&#13;
division of labor between. males and females. This fact limits the reliability&#13;
of a strictly economic perspective on allocation of time to production of&#13;
"work", including wage employment.&#13;
The RIDS data did not yield. information concerning capital&#13;
transactions and capital formation that could give us a picture of the capital&#13;
market. Yet some prevailing knowledge and notations concerning transaction&#13;
and acquisition of assets, are pertinent to our discussion. Land in Botswana&#13;
is tribal and has been traditionally allocated on the basis of "need" and&#13;

usability. This reality, which is discussed in more detail in Chapter 4, has&#13;
led us to assume that while land in Botswana is by-and-large free, usable land&#13;
may be rather scarce.&#13;
Drought-power is a critical element in agricultural production in&#13;
Botswana. There appears to be a limited market for the renting of farm&#13;
implements and cattle. However, as agricultural activities in Botswana depend&#13;
,critically on timing (often to the day) because of rains, drought-power can&#13;
generally be rented by households who do not own their own equipment and&#13;
cattle only "off" optimal time.&#13;
We have no information on the scope of borrowing and lending in rural&#13;
Botswana. Institutional borrowing in the large villages has been growing with&#13;
the introduction of banks. However, it has been known that the people have&#13;
always preferred investing in cattle rather than in financial assets, and&#13;
banks' lending has been limited primariLy to housing and other assets which&#13;
can serve as collateral. Since cattle serve as poor collateral, and&#13;
apparently yield a higher private rate of return than financial assets, there&#13;
is little economic scope for development of a formal capital market in this&#13;
traditional setting.&#13;
Hence, households in rural Botswana operate in an economic&#13;
environment with little scope for dependence upon a market for buying and&#13;
selling services. At the same time, people seize economic opportunities when&#13;
they appear, demonstrating decidedly entrepreneurial behavior. In spite of&#13;
the distances separating households and settlements, and of poor&#13;
transportation, information seems to travel rapidly. A glass of home-brewed&#13;
beer usually has a uniform price across the country. Probably because long&#13;
distance and extended visiting is common, people appear well-informed on many&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
matters, including wages and job opportunit:ies. Such phenomena are believed&#13;
to explain some consistent and systematic elements of economic behavior which&#13;
we will attempt to formulate here.&#13;
2.3 The Unit of Analysis - The Household&#13;
The household is the basic behavioral unit we attempt to study&#13;
here. Yet, it could not be precisely identified and defined for analytical&#13;
purposes.&#13;
As in many other developing areas, in Botswana members of the same&#13;
family who share the same familiar and economic endowments, tend often to be&#13;
in different locations at any given time. This has complicated not only the&#13;
count of the size of the household, but particularly the documentation of the&#13;
flow of remittances and transfers, most significant in Botswana, from and into&#13;
a specific dwellLng which was observed.&#13;
Within dwellings we could identify about twenty "types" of families,&#13;
in terms of relationships existing under the same roof. Variations have&#13;
resulted largely from customary support sysl:ems for the aged as well as for&#13;
the relatively young.   In the case of the latter, for instance, it is common&#13;
in Botswana to find children of virtually all ages being cared for by&#13;
relatives. In recent years schooling has become a major reason for children&#13;
to live with relatives who reside near schools.&#13;
By and large the discussion here is confined to those family members&#13;
who were present in the sampled dwelling during at least one of the&#13;
interviews.  While other family members are registered, information concerning&#13;
their economic links with the household is extremely tenuous. For example, we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
had to disregard an explicit account of the demographic and economic roles of&#13;
mine workers.4&#13;
For analytical purposes, the household is considered to be an entity&#13;
that, for its well-being, wishes to enhance the following welfare&#13;
attributes: i) level of consumption, ii) the amount of leisure time its&#13;
members enjoy, and iii) the number of children it has, as well as, iv) the&#13;
educational levels of these children. In a situation where people work for&#13;
their living and can work as much as they desire, people allocate part of&#13;
their time to work in order to earn an income. Following analytical&#13;
frameworks by Lancaster and Becker, the household is assumed to "produce"&#13;
these attributes with inputs of time, and goods which are obtained through&#13;
income. For instance, to "produce" children the household needs to allocate&#13;
time for child care and other resources, such as food and clothing, obtained&#13;
by sacrificing some income.5&#13;
From an economic perspective, the higher the household's income and&#13;
the lower the costs of obtaining each of these four welfare attributes, the&#13;
more the household can afford of them.&#13;
The household in Botswana is assumed to secure its income from three&#13;
potential sources: farm or household-enterprise production, wage earnings,&#13;
4   The Botswana National Migration Survey conducted in 1979 should shed some&#13;
lLght on this matter.&#13;

and transfers snd remittances from family members.6 In a non-traditional&#13;
setting, incomes are generated "outside" the household-- in the market--&#13;
primarily by selling labor in the wage labor market, and by various forms of&#13;
lending or renting capital and land in the capital market. For reasons&#13;
discussed in the previous section, the implied classification of household&#13;
activities as either market or non-market activities is unrealistic in a&#13;
traditional setting such as the one in rural Botswana.    The two facets of the&#13;
household's economic behavior, the production of its welfare attributes and&#13;
income are interwoven, because substantially, or most, income is generated on&#13;
farms or in household enterprises.&#13;
Hence, we consider the household in rural Botswana as a relatively&#13;
self-contained economic entity because it does not buy or sell labor or&#13;
capital services in what: we might consider a market.7 The household's&#13;
production processes and! their analytical handling are discussed in the&#13;
following section.&#13;
6   Transfers and remittances from family members are a major source of&#13;
livelihood in Botswana. From a conceptual view point, we distinguish&#13;
remittances from transfers, in that the former imply a household&#13;
decision that one or more of its nmembers work elsewhere, commonly in&#13;
the mines of South Africa.   Transfers are considered gifts from&#13;
outside the household.&#13;

2.4 Household Income and Production&#13;
In this section we consider expLicitly the household's sources of&#13;
income and two "household production" processes: raising children and&#13;
educating them.&#13;
As already mentioned, we consider here three sources of income:&#13;
production of farm or household enterprise, wage employment, and transfers and&#13;
remittances. The first source requires time inputs of household members,&#13;
productive assets such as land, agricultural and other implements, technical&#13;
know-how and intermediate products such as drought power, seeds, etc., all&#13;
depending on the particular production process.&#13;
Earnings depend on the amount of time the household sells in the&#13;
labor market, and the wage rates that each unit of time commands. A person's&#13;
wage rate in a given labor market, is known to be relative to his or her level&#13;
of education and other characteristics such as age - which usually indicates&#13;
levels of experience and seniority - and gender- which may be a basis for&#13;
institutional discrimination in the labor market.&#13;
Remittances should not be differentiated in most respects from wage&#13;
earnings, but given the special nature of this source of income and the&#13;
difficulties in measuring it properly compared with other sources of income,&#13;
it is handled separately to the degree possible. It is clear that it may&#13;
often be hard to distinguish between remittances and transfers (gifts) in&#13;
particular, because the definition of a household becomes crucial on this&#13;
matter.&#13;
The process of child-care and education are of particular interest to&#13;
us from an economic perspective. Child care requires the allocation by&#13;
household members of time which could be used for leisure or to produce&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
income, and the sacrifice of consumption by parents. Similarly, schooling&#13;
consumes children's time, which could be used for work and housecare, as well&#13;
as other resources.&#13;
In summary, we wish to look at how the household generates its income&#13;
by particular sources, a.nd what determines the levels of time inputs to "work"&#13;
or to income producing activities, and the levels of incomes generated. The&#13;
particular production processes we shall study because of their particular&#13;
relevance to issues of unemployment and because of data problems are crop&#13;
production and wage earnings. In addition, we shall look at levels of&#13;
fertility and education -as outcomes of the household's (economic) decision-&#13;
making process.&#13;
Before turning to the analyses in the following chapters, a few&#13;
circular, or simultaneous, relationships must be acknowledged, as they present&#13;
us with some of our basic analytical problems. First of all, when the&#13;
household members work as; much as they wish, the level of income generated&#13;
through work and. the level of leisure are co-determined; i.e., while we&#13;
stipulate that leisure depends upon income, income depends upon leisure.&#13;
Secondly, in a dynamic framework, the productive assets which determine level&#13;
of income stem from savirgs which in turn dlepend upon past incomes. Thirdly,&#13;
household size determines the household's labor endowments and hence its&#13;
income. That is, over space and time some basic socio-economic outcomes (time&#13;
allocation, income and holdings of human and non-human capital) are decided&#13;
upon in a manner in which cause and effect are not easy to establish.&#13;
Consequently, for both analytical and empirical reasons we assume that&#13;
particular socio-economic circumstances and phenomena are not "outcomes" of&#13;
the household decision-making process in what we consider to be the short&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
run. Rather, they are the ultimate determinants of the particular outcomes at&#13;
which we look. These determinants include: household size and composition;&#13;
levels of human and non-human capital; wage rates household members can&#13;
command in the labor market; and levels of remittances and transfer incomes.&#13;
In the chapters which follow we spell out specific assumptions and&#13;
hypotheses concerning the particular topic studied.&#13;

Chapter 3: The Value and Allocation of Time in Rural Botswana&#13;
Eva Mueller&#13;
3.1. Introduction&#13;
In rural Botswana, as is true of the agricultural sector in other&#13;
developing economies, a substantial portion of economic activity takes place&#13;
outside the so-called formal and monetized sector. As a result a considerable&#13;
amount of wealth and economic activity is difficult to measure. Prior to the&#13;
Rural Income Distribution Survey (RIDS) little information was available to&#13;
the Government of Botswana about levels of income and the process which&#13;
generates incomme in the rural sector. A major step toward understanding this&#13;
process and assessing the relation between rural resources and rural activity&#13;
patterns was the collection of time use data by RIDS.&#13;
TraditiLonally the economic activilties of rural populations have been&#13;
studied by collecting data on labor force lparticipation, employment, and&#13;
unemployment. The time use data extend these measurements by providing&#13;
information on hours worlced for wages and Ln family enterprises which may be&#13;
viewed as an indicator oE the extent or duration of labor utilization. We are&#13;
particularly interested to learn how holdinigs of productive assets (including&#13;
education) affect time aLlocations to economic work.1 That is, we shall&#13;
investigate how inequali;ties in resources ownership affect the opportunity of&#13;
peasant families to engage in productive work.&#13;
1 In this chapter the terms market work, economic work, and labor refer to&#13;
activities which contribute to GNP, including unpaid family labor and work&#13;
that earns income in kind. Housework is a separate and distinct time use&#13;
category.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Since time use data are a relatively new type of information, their&#13;
usefulness in broadening the analysis of welfare problems should be pointed&#13;
out. Time can be directly consumed in the form of leisure and it can also be&#13;
regarded as an input into the generation of income and other utilities such as&#13;
education and the rearing of children.2 It has been clear all along that&#13;
labor market activities represent only a single facet of households' and&#13;
individuals' welfare generating pursuits. Yet key economic problems such as&#13;
under- and unemployment have been discussed as if only economic work were&#13;
"productive" of human welfare.3 Against this background, time use data --&#13;
providing a complete account of activities -- appear to have major&#13;
potential. They offer the possibility of extending the scope and definition&#13;
of "productive activity" beyond that relating to the generation of income.&#13;
Thus time use data can improve the measurement of human welfare and, when&#13;
accompanied by information on human and non-human capital, income and&#13;
household characteristics, can contribute to our understanding of how&#13;
differentials in levels of welfare, broadly defined, are brought about.&#13;
This study is distinctive in that it views every member of the&#13;
household above age 6 as a potential contributor to household welfare. As&#13;
part of this investigation, we shall examine how the age/sex composition of&#13;
the household and its size affects its time allocation and its labor supply.&#13;
In Chapters 6 and 7 inferences are drawn from this analysis regarding the&#13;
2 The term income is used to include income in kind.&#13;
3 The interest in time use data has been increasing in more developed&#13;
countries as well, as time allocated to labor market activities has been&#13;
steadily decreasing.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

opportunity cost of school attendance and the value of children's labor as a&#13;
motive for high fertility.&#13;
The framework outlined in Chapter 2 assumes that time allocations are&#13;
responsive to economic incentives. That is, these allocations are expected to&#13;
be sensitive to income and price-of-time (or productivity) effects. At the&#13;
same time we recognize that a culturally determined division of labor by age&#13;
and sex constrains household choice. A further purpose of this chapter is to&#13;
clarify the relative role of economic and institutional influences on time use&#13;
decisions.&#13;
Five sections follow this introduetion. In the second section we&#13;
discuss the data and describe time use patiterns in rural Botswana. Then we&#13;
address some conceptual problems in the thLrd section. Productivity of time&#13;
and the determinants of itime allocation are analyzed in sections four and five&#13;
respectively.   Conclusions are deferred to the end and are presented in&#13;
section 6.&#13;
3.2. Data and Setting&#13;
The tinme allocat:ion data pertain to the day prior to the interview&#13;
and were obtained only in rounds 3, 5, 7, c9 and 11, of the twelve survey&#13;
rounds. Interviews were spread over all days of the week, including Saturdays&#13;
and Sundays. All persons in the household, 6 years of age and above, were&#13;
asked to recall the previous day's activities and the approximate amount of&#13;
time each activity occupied in chronological order from the time they got up&#13;
in the morning until they retired at night; mealtime was omitted.&#13;
The period not covered by the time use study, February through April,&#13;
falls into the busy season. Thus the time frame of the study leads to some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
understatement of economic activities. Further, some minor activities seem to&#13;
be underreported in the survey. Any underreporting of work activities&#13;
probably implies an overstatement of leisure time. On the other hand, "rest&#13;
stops" during working hours and housework or a leisurely work pace could lead&#13;
to a considerable overstatement of working hours.&#13;
Almost all the data presented in this chapter are based on pooled&#13;
observations for all five visits and thus average out seasonal variations.&#13;
For the most part the data are presented on an individual rather than a&#13;
household basis. Non-response was negligible; for about 100 households the&#13;
time use information was too incomplete to be usable for analysis. This&#13;
exclusion is equivalent to a non-response rate of 10 percent. The 957&#13;
households remaining in the sample contain about 4,600 individuals over 6&#13;
years old.4&#13;
Although great emphasis was placed on accuracy during the conduct of&#13;
the survey, the level of detail of the time use data leaves something to be&#13;
desired. For many people, only one or two major activities are recorded for&#13;
each day. Some short-duration activities like carrying water are reported by&#13;
most households, but it is likely that other activities which occupy little&#13;
time or are of little salience to respondents are under-reported. It follows&#13;
that the RIDS time use data describe the allocation of time to major&#13;
activities only. There is no reason to suspect that underreporting varies&#13;
systematically with population characteristics. Hence, differences in time&#13;
use between sub-groups of the population may be assumed to reflect real&#13;
4 Individuals had to be present at 7 or more of the 12 survey visits to&#13;
qualify as household members for purposes of the time use analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
differences in behavior, rather than errors in the data. Comparisons of the&#13;
relative frequencies with which major activities occurred under various&#13;
conditions also should be valid.&#13;
Undoubtedly, people in rural Botswana do not keep precise track of&#13;
time during their daily activities; they merely know that they devoted half of&#13;
the day to one activity and half to another. In cases where the respondent&#13;
reported time use in terms of fractions of a day, the interviewers were&#13;
instructed to assume a day of 12 hours (roughly the time from sunrise to&#13;
sunset). Therefore the distribution of time between activities probably is&#13;
more reliable than the absolute amount of time spent on activities. For this&#13;
reason the descriptive tables show percentage distributions, rather than mean&#13;
amounts of time spent on various activities.&#13;
Tables 3.1 and 3.2 present an overiiew of time use within age groups,&#13;
for men and women respectively. Patterns oE time use vary sharply by age and&#13;
sex. Animal husbandry is predominantly a male activity, and men are also more&#13;
involved in wage labor than women. Women spend the largest part of their&#13;
income earning time on crop cultivation, buit this is not exclusively a female&#13;
activity. Men participate in certain essenitial operations such as land&#13;
clearing, plowing and planting.&#13;
Women aind girls (lo most of the gathering, and they engage to a lesser&#13;
extent in other economic activities. Their most time-consuming activities&#13;
are, however, houisework, childcare and fetchling water. In all, adult men&#13;
spend about 75 percent more time on income earning activities than adult&#13;
women. Despite ithis, aduLt women still reported on the average nearly 25&#13;

percent less leisure than men, due to their involvement in housekeeping and&#13;
childcare, in addition to economic work.5&#13;
Men and women aged 60 and over spend significant amounts of time in&#13;
income earning activities. On the whole they seem to be a considerable asset&#13;
to the household, or at least less of a burden than is often supposed.&#13;
Boys seem to be heavily involved in income earning activities even&#13;
before they are 10 years old, and at ages 10-14 they spend as much time on&#13;
income earning activities as adult males. The job of taking care of the small&#13;
stock in the household falls in large part to the younger boys, while older&#13;
boys (10 and over) herd and water the cattle.&#13;
Girls provide some help in the fields and in caring for the smaller&#13;
animals, but their main contribution consists of child care and housework, to&#13;
which they devote substantial amounts of time. Girls report slightly more&#13;
school hours than boys; but over the year children of both sexes allocate at&#13;
least twice as much time to market and housework as they do to schooling. It&#13;
appears that children make a substantial economic contribution to the&#13;
household by working and by relieving women of some domestic duties.&#13;
A number of studies reporting labor inputs to agriculture in Africa&#13;
have shown surprisingly low levels of manhours worked per year.6 The Botswana&#13;

data for adult males conform to this pattern. Some observers have attributed&#13;
this phenomenon to the marked seasonality of agricultural work. The&#13;
seasonality of time use Ln rural Botswana is illustrated in Tables 3.3 and&#13;
3.4. Men allocate about 60 percent more time to income earning activities in&#13;
May than in November, and boys about 100 percent more.   The seasonality of&#13;
time use is even more pronounced for women and girls because crop production&#13;
is largely "women's work."&#13;
Time devoted by women to housekeeping activities and child care is&#13;
curtailed somewhat during the busy season, but girls compensate for this&#13;
shortfall by devoting extra time to domestic chores. In total, housework time&#13;
seems to be quite insensitive to the seasonality in labor demand.&#13;
Consequently, aduilts gain considerable leisure time during the slack work&#13;
season. Children's time Ls shifted to school attendance in the slack season&#13;
(vacations coinc:Lde roughLy with the busy work season).&#13;
Some knowledgeabLe observers believe that Botswana is suffering from&#13;
a great deal of underemployment. Michael Lipton estimated that "some 45&#13;
percent of potential labor time is wasted in idleness, and the productivity of&#13;
the time at work is very ]ow."7  Quite apart from the accuracy of this&#13;
estimate, the underemployment question involves a value judgment since there&#13;
is no norm to indicate how much leisure time is "appropriate." Relatively,&#13;
adult males and children who do not attend school report more leisure time&#13;
than do women and children who attend school.&#13;

Tables 3.5 and 3.6 throw some light on the under- and unemployment&#13;
issue which will be addressed later on in this chapter and volume. These&#13;
tables compare time use in large and small villages and in Baralong Farms --&#13;
the major commercial farming area in Botswana. The data for Baralong Farms&#13;
show how time is used in an area with relatively high labor demand. Men and&#13;
boys in Baralong Farms work substantially more hours than men in other places,&#13;
but boys still show relatively high school attendance. If men and boys in&#13;
Baralong Farms are not "over worked," people in the other villages might&#13;
prefer less leisure and more productive work opportunities. All household&#13;
members, regardless of age and sex, have less leisure in Baralong Farms than&#13;
elsewhere.&#13;
Wage labor makes up a small fraction of market work as indicated by&#13;
the figures in Tables 3.1. and 3.2. This finding is borne out by the data in&#13;
Table 3.7 which reveals that there is practically no wage labor market for&#13;
children under 15, and that for young people 15-19 wage employment is rare and&#13;
of short duration.8 About 20 percent of the women aged 20-59 worked for wages&#13;
at some time during the survey year, but fewer than 6 percent had jobs which&#13;
lasted 180 days or more during the year. In comparison, about 30 percent of&#13;
males aged 20-59 had wage jobs, including about 15 percent with durations in&#13;
excess of 180 days. The figures in Tables 3.3 and 3.4 show no appreciable&#13;
seasonality in wage labor. It thus appears that households which do not have&#13;
sufficient land and cattle to employ all household members productively often&#13;
8 This table is based on more extensive data on number of days engaged in wage&#13;
labor each month, obtained in the 12 monthly interviews concerning&#13;
household income.&#13;

may not be able to find adequate employmeni: in the wage labor market even&#13;
during the busy season.&#13;
Table 3.8 enables us to compare the total time contributed to&#13;
economic work by adult men, women, and children. A striking fact emerges&#13;
that, because of the high birth rate and the high out-migration rate, men&#13;
between the ages of 20 and 59 constitute a mere 16 percent of Botswana's rural&#13;
population and contribute only 24 percent of all incozme earning time. Women&#13;
aged 20 to 59 constitute 27 percent of the population and account for 24&#13;
percent of income earning time. Boys aged 7 to 19 contribute time in excess&#13;
of their proportion in the population, while the reverse is true for girls.&#13;
In all, children and young adults (7 to 19) account for 42 percent of all&#13;
income earning tiLme. Howover, there is a good deal of diversity between and&#13;
within age/sex groups in regard to labor productivity and time allocations.&#13;
In the sections which follow, we shall attenmpt to explain these diverse&#13;
patterns.&#13;
3.3. Some Analytical Problems&#13;
Before embarking on the analysis of the value or productivity of time&#13;
and time allocations, we must consider a few conceptual issues.*  The first&#13;
concerns the characteristics of the labor market in rural Botswana. In many&#13;
rural economies a wage labor market exists, allowing households which are&#13;
asset-poor to hire out some of their labor to households, business firms, or&#13;
government agencies which have larger holdings of productive assets. The&#13;
process of hiring labor out: and hiring in tends to equalize the marginal&#13;

productivity of a given kind of labor throughout the rural economy. As we&#13;
have seen, opportunities for wage labor are quite limited in Botswana,&#13;
particularly for women and children. Only 11 percent of the work time of all&#13;
members of the labor force is devoted to wage work and there is little&#13;
seasonal variation in wage labor time. Data (not shown here) indicate that&#13;
about half of the people who engage in wage labor are government employees,&#13;
sales and construction workers, mechanics, tanners, drivers, teachers, nurses,&#13;
and the like, leaving only a small group which performs agricultural labor.&#13;
Lucas (Chapter 4) finds that only one percent of crop-producing households&#13;
reported any expenditure on wage labor. This figure does not include&#13;
expenditures on plowing services reported by 17 percent of such households,&#13;
often female headed.&#13;
A household which does not buy or sell labor may be called an&#13;
autarchical household.9 The concept of an autarchical farm operation accords&#13;
with a good deal of evidence from farm management studies in LDC showing that&#13;
labor intensity and output per acre are inversely related to size of&#13;
landholdings.10 Lucas (Chapter 4) finds the same to be true for crop&#13;
production in Botswana. Autarchical modes of production imply that asset-poor&#13;
households often use family labor to a point where marginal returns fron work&#13;
are very low rather than hiring out their surplus labor to households with&#13;
more resources who could use that labor more productively. This is not the&#13;
place to analyze the reasons for the existence of autarchical working&#13;

arrangements. They may reflect a reluctance on the part of small farmers to&#13;
hire out family labor, high transport costs, a view on the part of larger&#13;
farmers that hired labor is less desirable than family labor, or an&#13;
institutionally determined agricultural wage which is too high to clear the&#13;
labor market.11 The point is that, to the extent that autarchical modes of&#13;
production prevail, the household's access to productive assets and know-how&#13;
rather than a market wage determine the value of time. This study will&#13;
therefore differ from previous research in that it will attempt to derive at&#13;
least a rough estimate of the marginal productivity of work performed by&#13;
relating time iniputs into the production process to income generated by this&#13;
work, rather than by assuming that prevailing wage rates measure the&#13;
opportunity cost of time for all members of the households and at all times of&#13;
the year.&#13;
The marginal productivity of labor is of interest not only because it&#13;
influences time allocations but also because it may help us to evaluate how&#13;
adequately the rural labor supply is utilized. There is no doubt general&#13;
agreement that work having zero marginal productivity would signify surplus&#13;
labor.12 However, zero marginal productivity is a polar case and should&#13;
rarely be found in practice, except perhaps where somebody works for training,&#13;
to keep busy, to keep up social appearances, to keep company - as may be the&#13;

case among some children in Botswana -- or where certain activity-shariag&#13;
arraagements have become imstitutiomalized.   Laborers doing work of very low&#13;
productivity also may be regarded as beiag uader-utilized but there is ao&#13;
generally accepted criterioia for deciding how low productivity has to be to&#13;
sigaify under-utilization.&#13;
The amouats of leisure time reported by differeat groups ia differeat&#13;
socio-ecomomic strata may be a partial iadicator of underemploymeat.   Im the&#13;
analysis which follows we shall look for evideace of both low margimal&#13;
productivity of labor amd loag hours of leisure time as iadicators of possible&#13;
uaderemploymeat. This may emable us to determime whether labor umder-&#13;
utilizatiom exists, but it will not allow us to quantify its extent. Because&#13;
time use data measure only work duratiom without regard to work iatensity, it&#13;
is particularly important to view loag leisure hours and low productivity as&#13;
two related facets of labor under-utilization whem amalyziag time use data.&#13;
Self-employed people who have little work to do may work more slowly or rest&#13;
more oftem than those who are pressed to accomplish a great deal. In that&#13;
case the productivity of work time should iadicate uader-utilizatioa, evea if&#13;
duration does aot.&#13;
Based on the theoretical framework pioneered by Becker aad Willis, an&#13;
individual's allocation of time to economic work may be viewed as a function&#13;
of the household's unearmed income, his own labor productivity and that of&#13;
other family members, together with some relevatt control variables.13&#13;

Increases in labor produ,ztivity should indiuce more economic work at the&#13;
expense of other activities through a price effect. At the same time&#13;
increases in labor productivity should reduce work time via an income&#13;
effect. The lat'ter expectation derives from the assumption that income&#13;
increases raise the demand for leisure and such other "normal" commodities&#13;
such as child schooling and child rearing at the expense of economic work. At&#13;
best, we can observe the net impact of labor productivity through both&#13;
channels of causation.   This problem limits the capacity of economic theory&#13;
and analysis to predict time allocations.&#13;
Labor productivLty can be viewed as a predetermined variable only&#13;
when generated by a compestitive labor market in which households buy and sell&#13;
labor whenever marginal productivities deviate from the market wage.    In a&#13;
setting where autarchicalt modes of production predominate, as in the case of&#13;
rural Botswana, a person's productivity depends largely on the complementary&#13;
resources available in the household enterprise such as education (know-how),&#13;
land, cattle, tools, etc. Moreover, the marginal productivity of labor is not&#13;
observable.&#13;
We shall therefore proceed in two, steps. First, we shall calculate a&#13;
household enterprise proiuction function and shall derive estimates of the&#13;
marginal producl:ivity of household labor, categorized by age and sex, from&#13;
that function. Thus in step one we shall obtain information on the magnitude&#13;
of marginal labor productivity and on the way in which time inputs, human and&#13;
non-human capital and certain control variables affect labor productivity.&#13;
These results have a bearing on the underemployment issue.&#13;
Second]Ly, we shall estimate the allocation of time by individuals as&#13;
a function of the variables considered to 'be predetermined in our analysis --&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

education of adults, productive assets, and demographic characteristics of the&#13;
household. In this analysis education and productive assets must be viewed as&#13;
proxies for productivity, i.e., as having price and income effects.&#13;
3.4 Productivity of Time&#13;
For estimation purposes income of household x (Ix) is considered net&#13;
of transfers. It is assumed to be generated by a production function where&#13;
age- sex-specific time   T c(a, s) , human capital (Ed) and physical assets (A)&#13;
are inputs, in addition to a set of controls (RV). We thus propose to&#13;
estimate:&#13;
ln I e  a + b In Tc(a,s) + clnEd   + dlnA  + e RV   + e.        (3.1)&#13;
x             x              x       x       x&#13;
The time inputs of households are here condensed into three&#13;
categories: total working time of males aged 15 and above, of females aged 15&#13;
and above, and of children 7-14 (regardless of sex). Children 15-19, a&#13;
relatively small group, are combined with adults since their efficiency in&#13;
production should come close to that of adults. Also, the time use analysis&#13;
will show some substitutability between the economic work time of young boys&#13;
and girls, between men and older boys, and between women and older girls. The&#13;
regressions were also run with children divided by sex and with separate&#13;
categories for time inputs by children 15-19. Instances where these more&#13;
detailed breakdowns provide additional (or different) information will be&#13;
reported in the text.&#13;
Before turning to the results, some limitations of the productivity&#13;
estimates must be pointed out. First, income and time allocation are&#13;
codetermined, but we do not have enough explanatory variables to identify a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
simultaneous equation system.   The simultaneity bias may led to some&#13;
underestimation of the time input coefficients. Second, land is not a major&#13;
constraint on production in Botswana although quality of land may be, but we&#13;
do not have a measure of land quality. Third, time use data based on a sample&#13;
of only 5 days in the year do not have a Uigh degree of precision.14    For&#13;
these reasons the estimated coefficients must be viewed as indicators of&#13;
orders of magnitude.&#13;
Since we are interested in productivity estimates for households&#13;
which exhibit substantial variations in earnings opportunities, a few&#13;
interactions are considered. We use first only nonwage or self employment&#13;
income as a dependent variable, and exclude time spent on wage labor from the&#13;
analysis. Then we add wages as part of income and wage labor as part of the&#13;
time inputs and reestimate the same function. We also differentiate between&#13;
households who own cattle and households who do not. A final distinction is&#13;
made between households with at least one male and one female age 15-64 and&#13;
households with no adult males (these constitute 29 percent of all&#13;
households). The various estimates of relationship (3.1) should enable us to&#13;
assess the relative productivity of time inputs of the various categories of&#13;
household members under different economic and demographic circumstances.&#13;
Table 3.9 presents the regression coefficients for all households&#13;
which contain at least one woman and one man of prime working age with self-&#13;
employment income as dependent variable. The equation for all households&#13;
14 Another problem is that Botswana has a strong tradition of mutual&#13;
assistance among relatives in economic work. Thus some reported economic&#13;
work may have been performed for other households. It is unlikely that&#13;
such practices affect our productivity estimates to an appreciable degree&#13;
since working for others in most cases involves some reciprocity.&#13;

explains 53 percent of the variance in income, for cattle owning households 52&#13;
percent, and for households without cattle only 16 percent. The differences&#13;
between the R2's reflect the significance of cattle ownership in the&#13;
determination of agricultural income in Botswana.&#13;
The regression coefficients (b) represent the elasticities of income&#13;
with respect to the inputs into the production function. Presumably a 10&#13;
percent increase in cattle ownership in cattle owning households would&#13;
increase self-eTnployment income in these households by 6 percent. However,&#13;
because of unavoidable shortcomings of the data and method, such precise&#13;
inferences are not warranted.   We can say ithat for all households and for&#13;
cattle owning households, the value of catt:le is the major determinant of&#13;
income.  Ownership of smaller animals also has a significant effect on income,&#13;
especially in households without cattle. Land seems to be important only in&#13;
households without cattle.   Education enhances self-employment income in&#13;
households without cattle, but not to any great extent.    Residents of Baralong&#13;
Farms, the commercial farming area in the sample, appear to have an advantage&#13;
in generating irLcome even among the self-employed; all other things equal,&#13;
they have higher incomes than residents of other areas.&#13;
As expected, adult male labor is a significant factor in the&#13;
production process under all observed circumstances. Children's labor makes a&#13;
significant contribution in cattle owning households only. Women's labor time&#13;
does not prove to be statistically significant in explaining variation in&#13;
household income.&#13;
Table 3.10 presents coefficients with wages included in income, and&#13;
wage work in working time. The importance of the education variable is&#13;
greatly increased in this version. This result indicates that, while&#13;

education has a moderate impact on earnings in self-employment, it has a major&#13;
effect on the opportunities for wage work as well as the level of wages, This&#13;
particular iSSUE- is discussed in detail in Chapter 5.&#13;
Location in a large village (as compared with a small village) offers&#13;
no advantages for self-employment but improves access to wage work, especially&#13;
the better paying wage jobs.&#13;
Animals and land are somewhat reduced in importance as source of&#13;
income when wage work is taken into account. The contribution of male labor&#13;
to income rises substantially when wages and time worked for wages are&#13;
included in the data; but this is not the case for women's and children's&#13;
labor. This finding is in accord with earlier evidence showing that men do&#13;
more wage labor than women, and that children do practically no wage labor.&#13;
The time inputs of children in cattle owning households remain significant&#13;
factors in the generation of household income; the time inputs of women and of&#13;
children in households without cattle remain insignificant.&#13;
Tables 3.9 and 3.10 included only households which contained a prime&#13;
working age male (15-64). Table 3.11 presents a similar analysis for female&#13;
headed households without prime working age males.&#13;
Most of the resu:Lts parallel those appearing in Tables 3.9 and&#13;
3.10. The greatest difference appears in the estimated contribution of time&#13;
inputs of adult romen to household income.   In female headed households the&#13;
economic workc time of women has a significant effect on household income,&#13;
especially when wrage work is included. The work contribution of children is&#13;
insignificant for the most part, probably because female headed households own&#13;
fewer animals than households with male heads. Education has a smaller&#13;
positive impact in female headed households than in others because female wage&#13;

rates are less responsive to educational attainment than males' wage rates (as&#13;
discussed in Chapter 5), and opportunities to obtain wage jobs also are more&#13;
limited for women. As noted earlier, Baralong Farms do not offer the same&#13;
economic opportunities in commercial crop production to women as to men. Also&#13;
there is a stronger negative relation between the age of females heading&#13;
households and lhousehold income than between the age of males heading&#13;
households and 'household income.&#13;
A number of alternative forms of the production function were&#13;
calculated, including a linear form with and without interactions between&#13;
hours worked and assets, separate equations for high, middle and low income&#13;
households, difEerent age divisions, household composition groups, and the&#13;
like. Such experimentation is justified as long as the results are viewed as&#13;
a kind of sensitivity analysis.   The findings regarding the relation of time&#13;
inputs to income were found to be quite robust.   Hours of adult male labor&#13;
always have a significant positive relation to income. Child labor inputs are&#13;
significant in cattle owning households only. When boys' and girls' working&#13;
hours are treated as two separate inputs, only the work contributions of boys&#13;
in cattle owning households appear statistically significant. The regression&#13;
coefficient for inputs of working time by adult women is significant only in&#13;
female headed households.15&#13;
15 In a similar study in rural Niger, based on much more detailed time use&#13;
data for each agricultural operation and each field, translog production&#13;
equations were estimated with child labor inputs included. The results&#13;
indicate that the effect of child labor (8-14 years old) upon agricultural&#13;
output levels was not significantly different from zero. However, female&#13;
labor was infinitely substitutable for male labor and had a positive&#13;
marginal productivity. See Randall Stuart Thomas-Peterhans, The&#13;
Stratification of the Production and Marketing of Livestock in South-&#13;
eastern Niger in the Department of Zinder (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation,&#13;
University of Michigan, 1982, Chapter IV).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
Marginal productivities of work time were calculated from the&#13;
regressions in Tables 3.9-3.11. They may be expressed in pula per day,&#13;
assuming a 6-hour work day on the average. On this basis the marginal&#13;
productivity of male labor comes to .18-.22 Pula per day, and the marginal&#13;
productivity of female labor is slightly lower. These figures can be compared&#13;
with daily wage rates to give the reader some perspective on the orders of&#13;
magnitude involved. As shown In Chapter 5, at the time of the survey the&#13;
average daily wage in rural areas was 1.26 Pula for men without education and&#13;
1.50 Pula for those with 1-4 years of schooling; it was .54 Pula for women&#13;
with 0-4 years of education. Thus the marginal productivities are for the&#13;
most part much lower than the daily wage.16 This is not surprising,&#13;
considering the very limited opportunities for wage work and the widespread&#13;
poverty. At the time of the survey the average daily income per person In&#13;
rural areas was about .35 Pula.    Thus it is plausible that men would find it&#13;
worth while to pursue work in their own enterprises which at the margin&#13;
yielded the equivalent of only .18-.22 Pula a day.&#13;
To summarize this section, it appears that non-human capltal and to a&#13;
lesser extent human capital are critical in the determination of productivity&#13;
levels. In asset-poor households people are forced to undertake work of very&#13;
low productivity. Particularly, women and children in such households seem to&#13;
pursue income-earnings activities up to a point where the marginal return to&#13;
their labor is close to zero. Because men have the option to migrate and male&#13;
labor is relatively scarce, the marginal productivity of male labor is higher,&#13;
even in asset-poor households.&#13;
16 The same result was obtained in Niger. See Thomas-Peterhans, ibid.,&#13;
Chapter IV.&#13;

3.5. Determinants of Time Use&#13;
The determinants of time use were estimated by means of regression&#13;
analysis. The dependent variable for the analysis of time allocation is tij,&#13;
the amount of time spent by individual i on activity j. Four categories of&#13;
activities are considered: (1) economic work, (2) housework and child care,&#13;
(3) schooling for age groups 7-19, and (4) leisure. Housework and child care&#13;
are combined since they are often concurrent activities. The unit of&#13;
measurement for time allocation is total number of minutes spent on each&#13;
activity category summed over the five days. Wage labor is measured, however,&#13;
in days per year for reasons to be explained later.&#13;
The independent, exogeneous variables include human and non-human&#13;
assets, and demographic characteristics of the household. These variables are&#13;
entered additively into the estimating equation:&#13;
t   - a + bEdi+ cEdx + dAx + eIux +fRVx     c              (3.2)&#13;
By estimating the linear model and using the same explanatory variables for&#13;
each of the four time uses, one can canpare the regression coefficients across&#13;
equations to observe possible substitutions between one time use and&#13;
another. 17&#13;
As noted earlier, asset holdings act in the regressions as proxies&#13;
for both earned income and price effects.   The physical assets (Ax) included&#13;
17 Total activity time doeta not add to the same number of hours in each&#13;
household, since eating and sleeping times were omitted. However, there&#13;
is a fairly narrow dispersion around a mean of 12 hours.&#13;

Data on equipment owned were collected, but they are too highly correlated&#13;
with other assets to be useful in the analysis. The ownership of human&#13;
capital is represented in this section by two measures: (1) the education of&#13;
the person whose time allocations is being analyzed (Edi) and (2) the highest&#13;
education among adults in the household (Edx). Transfer income (Iux) are the&#13;
only directly measured source of income that is entered into the equation as a&#13;
predetermined variable.&#13;
Household size is represented by a series of variables reflecting the&#13;
size of each age/sex group. This permits different kinds of household members&#13;
to influence time allocation differently. The remaining independent variables&#13;
control for age and village characteristics. Separate equations are estimated&#13;
for males and females 20-64. Children 7-19 also are divided by sex since the&#13;
sexual division of labor leads boys and girls to pursue quite different&#13;
activities. Young people aged 15-19 are here grouped with children rather&#13;
than adults since, like children (1) they do very little wage labor, and (2)&#13;
they still show a fair amount of school attendance. Initially separate&#13;
regressions were run for age groups 7-14 and 15-19 but findings were quite&#13;
similar. Hence for the sake of brevity, the younger and older children of&#13;
each sex are combined, with a control for age among the explanatory variables.&#13;
The results for adult men are presented in Table 3.12, for adult&#13;
women in Table 3.13, and for boys and girls in Tables 3.14 and 3.15,&#13;
18 The data on land holdings are weak; for about one-third of households it&#13;
cannot be determined whether they had no land or whether they had land but&#13;
the area was unknown. Further, no information is available on land&#13;
quality or value. It is quite possible that larger holdings are of poorer&#13;
quality than smaller holdings.&#13;

respectively. School tin.e is not shown in the first two tables since adults&#13;
rarely go to school in rural Botswana; at most they receive some religious or&#13;
agricultural instruction. Mean education time is only 24 minutes for men and&#13;
23 minutes for women over a span of five days. For adults, economic work is&#13;
divided into two components, wage work and non-wage economic time, because we&#13;
expect the independent variables to have quite different relations to these&#13;
two sub-categories. Wage time is measured by the more complete series on wage&#13;
labor (obtained in 12, rather than 5 rounds) and refers to days worked during&#13;
the entire year instead of minutes worked on the five sample days. Since&#13;
children rarely work for wages, the wage equations are omitted in Tables 3.14&#13;
and 3.15.&#13;
The education coefficients show that the more educated males spend&#13;
more time in wages labor and less in self-employment than males with less&#13;
education. This result is consistent with our earlier finding that education&#13;
enhances productivity in wage employment much more than productivity in self-&#13;
employment. The effect on adult females is similar, except that women reduce&#13;
housework in favor of wage employment. In some cases servants may help with&#13;
the housework in the most educated households. For adults of both sex,&#13;
leisure time is not significantly influenced by education. We may infer that&#13;
the negative effect of education on leisure via higher labor productivity and&#13;
the positive effect via hLgher income roughly offset one another.&#13;
Boys who spend more time in school devote less time to economic work,&#13;
while girls do letss housework; children of both sexes also reduce their&#13;
leisure time due to schooling. The findings that in the more educated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
households boys do more housework probably implies that boys substitute to&#13;
some extent for their sisters who also go to school.19 In total, children's&#13;
economic work is more significantly reduced by school attendance than are&#13;
housework or leisure, although the latter activities are curtailed&#13;
appreciably.&#13;
The higher the level of livestock ownership, the more time adult&#13;
males devote to farming and the less time they devote to wage employment.&#13;
Large landholdings induce only a small increase in male time spent on farm&#13;
activities, since crop cultivation is largely "women's work." In the case of&#13;
women, total economic work requires more time in households with large&#13;
landholdings than in those with smaller holdings. Landholdings and large&#13;
herds of smaller animals reduce wage time. The finding that large&#13;
landholdings also are associated with larger time inputs by women into&#13;
housework is puzzling, especially since the same relationship is evident for&#13;
men. We suspect that some borderline economic work, such as crop processing&#13;
and garden cultivation, is misclassified as housework. Leisure time of males&#13;
is quite insensitive to holdings of productive assets, as it is to&#13;
education. Again we infer that price-of-time and income effects offset one&#13;
another. Leisure time of women, on the other hand, is reduced on balance when&#13;
landholdings are relatively large.&#13;
As predicted by the earlier productivity analysis, cattle ownership&#13;
has a very strong positive effect on the economic time inputs of boys 15-19&#13;
years of age, somewhat weaker for the younger boys (not shown separately in&#13;
19 Tables 3.14 and 3.15 show somewhat higher mean school hours for girls than&#13;
for boys. See also Ch. 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
Table 3.14). The economic work time of younger boys is positively and&#13;
significantly correlated with holdings of smaller animals, which are typically&#13;
herded by them. For boys the productivity effect of animal ownership clearly&#13;
outweighs the income effect. The economic work time of girls also is&#13;
positively related to ownership of smaller animals, for which they sometimes&#13;
help to care. Since girls do not herd cattle, only the negative income effect&#13;
of cattle ownership on work time is evident. However, in cattle owning&#13;
households girls do more housework, thereby relieving their brothers from&#13;
domestic obligations.&#13;
The reLation between landholdings and children's work is weaker and&#13;
less consistent in sign than is the case for animal holdings. In the case of&#13;
girls, larger landholdings seem to be associated with more housework,&#13;
presumably freeing the mother for crop cultivation. In this indirect way,&#13;
large landholdings enhance the economic role of girls and shorten their&#13;
leisure hours.&#13;
Schooling time of boys is curtailed very significantly by ownership&#13;
of smaller animals, while large cattle holdings signify high income and hence&#13;
a stronger positive income effect on schooling.  Since the marginal&#13;
productivity of girls in economic work is relatively low, it is not surprising&#13;
that assets tendi to be positively reLated to school attendance (via the income&#13;
effect), although this -relationship is not very robust.&#13;
Transfer incomees are normally fassociated with a pure income effect.&#13;
This is not to be expected in Botswana since a substantial part of transfer&#13;
income comes frcm adult maLes who are away for work in South Africa or the&#13;
towns of Botswana. Thus there may be some selectivity bias in that households&#13;
with low labor requirements are more likely to have outmigrants. On the other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
hand, a "displacement effect" may occur whereby all other things being equal,&#13;
family members who are left behind must substitute in economic or household&#13;
work for the absent member. The estimated coefficients indicate that, as the&#13;
level of transfer incomes rises, economic work by adult men as well as women&#13;
decreases and leisure increases. By contrast, the displacement seems to&#13;
affect boys; as transfer incomes rise, boys do more economic work, apparently&#13;
at the expense of schooling.&#13;
We turn now to the variables which reflect the household's demo-&#13;
graphic characteristics. Age is measured in the equations by actual age and&#13;
the square of its value. For adult males we cannot detect any age pattern in&#13;
time allocations from our cross-sectional data. In contrast women's economic&#13;
work increases up to about age 42, as child rearing gradually occupies less&#13;
time. After 42, aging reduces market work and household work and increases&#13;
leisure. Not surprisingly children's economic time increases with age and&#13;
then levels off, while the opposite is true for leisure time. School time&#13;
peaks around age 11-12.&#13;
A baby in the household is expected to put added demands on the&#13;
mother's housework time (which includes childcare) and that of other house-&#13;
hold members who can assist her. Indeed, the amount of time allocated to&#13;
housework by each woman aged 20-64 is raised modestly when a baby is present,&#13;
while leisure and economic work are reduced. However, as we just noted, an&#13;
additional effect of childrearing on women's time allocations seems to be&#13;
captured by the age variable. Girls likewise spend more time on housework and&#13;
have less leisure when there is a baby in the household. Men's leisure time&#13;
is curtailed somewhat under these circumstances, while housework time and&#13;
economic work time rise (the latter not significantly).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
In femlale headed households women spend more time on economic work&#13;
than do women in male hetaded households, largely at the expense of leisure.&#13;
Female headed hLouseholds have lower incames than male headed households and,&#13;
as we saw earlier, the lack of male labor in these households raises the&#13;
marginal productivity of women's work. To some extent women substitute for&#13;
the missing male labor. These circumstances help to explain the longer&#13;
working hours of women in these households. Table 3.13 also shows that female&#13;
headedness is associated with more wage labor by women, probably a consequence&#13;
of the low level of resources for self-employment (perhaps not fully captured&#13;
by our asset measures). Boys in female headed households do less economic&#13;
work and have more leisure than boys in male headed households, in full&#13;
consistency with the relatively limited opportunities for self-employment in&#13;
these households. Girls, on the other hand, do more housework and have less&#13;
leisure time, apparently substituting for ,their mothers.&#13;
Household composition effects may be measured by the number of house-&#13;
hold members in each age/sex category or by a single variable representing&#13;
household size. These measures were used Ln alternate equations, but only&#13;
results based on the more detailed measure are shown in the tables.&#13;
Regardless of measure, three findings stand out: (1) The larger the&#13;
household, the less leisure time its members have.   This result is consistent&#13;
for men and women aged 20-64; and children 7-19 of both sexes and is&#13;
statistically significant for each age/sex category. It suggests that in&#13;
larger households, which tend to have more dependent members (young children&#13;
and old people), have to work harder to provide sufficient income and&#13;
household services. It also suggests that after controlling for assets, there&#13;
are no important economies of scale in household size. (2) The larger the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
household, the more time each man, woman, and boy devotes to work in the&#13;
family enterprise, but not to wage work. This finding is closely related to&#13;
the previous one and probably has the same explanation. It also reinforces&#13;
other indications that wage work is not readily available to households which&#13;
(may need it. (3) The larger the household, the greater is the specialization&#13;
,'f children's functions along sex lines.   In the larger households, boys show&#13;
more school attendance and more economic work but less household work while&#13;
girls do more housework and less economic work. In the smaller households,&#13;
where the labor supply from children may not be well-balanced by sex, there is&#13;
more flexibility in the sexual divisions of labor.&#13;
The variables which represent number of members in each age/sex group&#13;
provide some further insights into substitutability between household&#13;
members. For example, when there are girls 15-19 in the household, they share&#13;
the housework with their mothers. The consequent reduction in housework per&#13;
adult woman frees up time for more economic work. On the other hand, children&#13;
under 15, young males 15-19, and to a lesser extent, elderly people increase&#13;
domestic obligations per woman.&#13;
Boys are substitutes for each other and, to some degree, for men.&#13;
The reduction in market work per boy which occurs as the number of boys and&#13;
adult males in the household increases is balanced by an increase in school&#13;
time. Apparently the demand for boys' labor, although substantial, is limited&#13;
by the household's asset holdings so that families with more than one boy may&#13;
send one of them to school while one or two others care for animals and&#13;
perform other chores. Economic work per girl also decreases as the number of&#13;
siblings increases leaving each girl more time for housework and schooling.&#13;
This finding confirms the view that there is a limited demand for economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
work by children, and that girls are substitutes in economic work for each&#13;
other and for boys.&#13;
As regards location, men and women in larger villages appear to have&#13;
more opportunitiLes for wage labor than their counterparts in smaller&#13;
villages. Men report more agricultural work in Baralong Farms than elsewhere&#13;
at the expense of household time and leisure. Place of residence also has&#13;
some impact on the time allocation of children. School attendance is greater&#13;
in Baralong Farms and larger villages than in smaller places for both boys and&#13;
girls. In the Baralong Farms area boys (like men) are heavily involved in&#13;
agricultural work. As a result of this work together with relatively high&#13;
school attendance, leisure hours are substantially shortened. In the larger&#13;
villages there seems to be less economic work available for children than in&#13;
the smaller ones, so that more frequent school attendance does not impinge&#13;
significantly on leisure time.&#13;
3.6. Summary and Conclusions&#13;
Time us,e data are an interesting new source of information about&#13;
household behavior. At the beginning of thLs paper a number of issues were&#13;
identified on which time use data might throw some light. These issues&#13;
concern income generation, employment, and the contribution of women and&#13;
children to household welfare. Findings related to these topics are&#13;
summarized in this section, along with some conclusions regarding the&#13;
potential value of time use data.&#13;
Time use! data arte of value first of' all for descriptive purposes. As&#13;
we saw, they tell a good deal more than conventional employment statistics do&#13;
about the uses which peopl.e make of their time in rural areas, about the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
various income earning activities by which they piece together a living, and&#13;
about variations in activity patterns by age and sex. By comparing time use&#13;
with income data, one can learn how time devoted to various economic&#13;
activities compares with the income earned from these activities. Our time&#13;
use data also provide information on the extent of seasonality in farm work;&#13;
such information can seldom be derived from conventional employment&#13;
statistics. Further, the descriptive data show how leisure, housework, and&#13;
schooling compete with economic work for household time.&#13;
The multivariate analysis of time use data presents some rather&#13;
serious methodological problems which stem from the codetermination, on the&#13;
one hand of productivity, time allocation, and incomes, and on the other,&#13;
total time allocated to particular activities by the household and the&#13;
division of labor among its members. This problem is compounded when the&#13;
household is close to an autarchic economic unit as appears to be the case for&#13;
many households in rural Botswana. We attempted to circumvent these problems&#13;
by looking separately at the productivity of time in conjunction with&#13;
household income and at the determinants of time use by different groups of&#13;
individuals and under different economic circumstances.&#13;
On a theoretical level, our findings are consistent with a number of&#13;
hypotheses set forth earlier in this chapter. These hypotheses imply that&#13;
time allocations are influenced by economic incentives, i.e., income and&#13;
productivity effects. To be sure, our data did not permit a statistical&#13;
separation of income and productivity effects, which usually operate on time&#13;
use in opposite directions. Yet, in a number of instances where one effect&#13;
could be assumed to be weak relative to the other, the stronger effect showed&#13;
the expected impact on time allocations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
The anLalysis of time allocations clearly shows that time devoted to&#13;
economic work, comprising self-employment and wage-employment, responds&#13;
positively to the household's human and non-human capital. The more&#13;
productive capital the hLousehold has, the more economic work its members,&#13;
particularly its male children, perform. Thus the productivity effect of&#13;
capital on economic work outweighs its income effect. And even though asset-&#13;
poor households are forced by their low income to engage in work of low&#13;
productivity, there is no evidence of a backward bending supply curve of&#13;
labor, i.e., of the income effect outweighing the productivity effect.&#13;
At the same time we found strong evidence that in rural Botswana time&#13;
allocations are constrained by a culturally determined division of labor by&#13;
age and sex. In order to adhere to this division of labor, households may&#13;
adjust their mix of assets in accordance wlth the available labor supply; for&#13;
example, households without adult males seldom raise cattle. Also, household&#13;
composition is quite fluid in rural Botswana and may be adjusted to match&#13;
asset holdings. Such chianges over time are known to occur but could not be&#13;
documented on the basis of our cross-sectional data set. However, we did see&#13;
evidence of some flexibility in the sexual division of labor. When households&#13;
have an unusual demand for the economic work time of a particular kind of&#13;
labor, say adull: females, other household members will substitute at the&#13;
margin for that person in housework and economic work. Likewise, when a&#13;
household lacks a particular category of latbor, say adult males, other&#13;
household members will porform some of the work that would normally be&#13;
assigned to the missing category of labor., In sume, the RIDS data show that&#13;
time allocationsi are subject to traditional norms and at the same time are&#13;
responsive to scoe degree to income and productivity effects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
Our estimates of the marginal productivity of work time can only be&#13;
viewed as approximations since data quality and statistical procedures are&#13;
subject to a number of reservations which have been discussed at some&#13;
length. The robustness of the conclusions nevertheless suggests that our&#13;
major findings are valid. In Botswana the marginal productivity of work time&#13;
in rural self-employment is very low. People with small holdings of&#13;
productive assets may be forced by their poverty to pursue some work which&#13;
adds only minimally to income. They may also slow their work pace in accord&#13;
with the available time. The marginal productivity of some time inputs by&#13;
children are close to zero (although average productivity is no doubt&#13;
positive). The productivity of adult male labor, of women's labor in female&#13;
headed households, and of children's labor in cattle raising households is&#13;
positive and significant at the margin, although quite low. This general&#13;
result has important implications for employment policy even if the calculated&#13;
regression coefficients andImarginal productivities are not precise.&#13;
Labor underutilization is a major issue in Botswana. It is difficult&#13;
to define the concept of surplus labor, especially in the case of women and&#13;
children. We have used a purely operational concept, viewing as "surplus" any&#13;
labor which does not make a statistically significant marginal contribution to&#13;
household income. We have also compared the amounts of leisure people have&#13;
under various economic and demographic conditions. Our findings are&#13;
consistent with Lipton's conclusion that there is substantial surplus labor in&#13;
the rural areas of Botswana. The incidence of under-employment varies,&#13;
however, by age, sex, and asset position.&#13;
The inference that there is underutilized adult male labor rests on&#13;
several findings. First, we saw that reported leisure time for adult males is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
higher than the leisure time reported for uromen and for children 10-19; adult&#13;
males have as much leisure as children 7-9 years of age.   Second, adult males&#13;
work 60 percent longer during the busy season than during the slack season,&#13;
and almost the entire seasonal differential in working time is balanced by&#13;
leisure. Third, adult males work about a third longer in the commercial&#13;
Baralong Farms area than in other places. And finally, we saw that the&#13;
marginal productivity of male labor is much lower than their market wage,&#13;
suggesting that some men are forced to undertake work which contributes only&#13;
very modestly to household income. This may be the case particularly in the&#13;
slack season and for men in asset-poor households.&#13;
It must be recognized that the advantaged position of adult males&#13;
with respect to ,Leisure may represent one of several facets of male privilege&#13;
in the Botswana culture. Therefore one muslt be cautious in inferring that&#13;
male labor is underutilized.   Still it is unlikely that cultural norms&#13;
regarding time use will survive if they are grossly inefficient&#13;
economically.20&#13;
Of course, the hl'gh male migration rate out of rural areas also&#13;
suggests that there is a surplus of male labor. However, we do not find a&#13;
surplus of male labor in the Lewis or Fei and Ranis sense, where outmigration&#13;
leaves rural production unaffected. The opportunity cost of men's time in&#13;
rural Botswana may be quite substantial during the busy season and seems to be&#13;
positive, though low, at other times. Moreover, the absence of male labor&#13;
handicaps the income earning effort of female headed households, as has been&#13;
shown elsewhere.21&#13;
20 This presumption is discussed by Gunnar Myrdal, Asian Drama.&#13;
21 Kossoudji and Mueller, op. cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
While out-migration removes much of the surplus of male labor from&#13;
the countryside, the migration rate of women is only about one-fourth that of&#13;
men. The sexual division of labor and child rearing obligation prevent&#13;
women's labor from being a close substitute for male labor. We found no&#13;
evidence in numerous formulations of the productivity analysis that the&#13;
marginal productivity of women is positive and significant except in female&#13;
headed households. In the slack season women work only about a third as much&#13;
as in the busy season; yet their housework time barely increases at all. It&#13;
appears that even in the busy season women are not so hard-pressed that they&#13;
are forced to cut corners on housework and child care. If both housework and&#13;
market work are taken into account women work about 25 percent longer than&#13;
men. Yet, considering the segmentation of the labor market and the low&#13;
productivity tasks assigned to women, the labor of women may be even less&#13;
effectively utilized than the labor of men.&#13;
About 70 percent of the increase in women's home time associated with&#13;
the presence of a baby is balanced by a reduction in leisure, while the&#13;
curtailment of women's economic work and girls' leisure is modest. Given this&#13;
finding together with the finding that in male headed households the     -&#13;
productivity of women's work is not significant at the margin, it would appear&#13;
that in rural Botswana the opportunity cost of women's time is not a weighty&#13;
deterrent to fertility. This inference is consistent with stated desires for&#13;
a large number of children. Since this issue will be discussed further in&#13;
Chapter 7, it is sufficient to add one qualification here. Babies need to be&#13;
cared for in the busy as well as the slack season, so that there are bound to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
be occasional periods in some households when child care interferes with&#13;
rewarding economiLc work.&#13;
Children, especially boys, tend to report long working hours in rural&#13;
Botswana. No doubt, children's work makes a significant contribution to&#13;
household welfare, but our data suggest that more child labor is available&#13;
than can be used productively. Evidence for this conclusion is provided by&#13;
the insignifican1: marginaiL productivity of children's labor in households&#13;
without cattle (about 45 percent of all housieholds) and the absence of a&#13;
market for child wage labor. In Baralong Farms, where adult males are engaged&#13;
in commercial crop cultivation, boys work muich longer hours in animal&#13;
husbandry than in other villages with out reducing their schooling, suggesting&#13;
that there may be excess Leisure in other places. Another piece of evidence&#13;
may be found in the negative partial correlations between the work time of&#13;
children and the number o, children in the household. Further, if adult&#13;
female labor is used in marginally productire work, women could probably do&#13;
with less assistance from daughters in housework and child care.&#13;
One may then wonder why children work such long hours and often do&#13;
not attend schooL. Part of the explanation may lie in measurement problems.&#13;
Time use data do not take account of the intensity of work. If some children&#13;
intersperse their work with play, reported working hours may be inflated.&#13;
Another part of 1the explamation may lie in social customs regarding work&#13;
sharing, parents' desire to train and socialize children for adult&#13;
responsibilities, and possibly the value parents attach to their own&#13;
leisure. Finally, we must remember that there are great variations among&#13;
households in the economic worktlme of children and that these are related to&#13;
asset holdings. Quite cliaarly, households which are well endowed with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
productive assets benefit substantially from the labor of their children,&#13;
while this is much less true for poor households. This finding has important&#13;
implications for the process of income determination and for fertility&#13;
decisions. We shall see in Chapter 7 that well endowed households do indeed&#13;
have more children.&#13;
The conclusions drawn here are derived from a data base which has&#13;
serious limitations. Since no comparable information is available for other&#13;
African countries, our conclusions for Botswana are worth setting forth even&#13;
though they are admittedly tentative. Further time use studies in Botswana or&#13;
other African countries are needed to test their validity and generality.&#13;
Future time use studies should, first of all, attempt to collect data for more&#13;
than five days during the year, so as to enhance the accuracy of the time use&#13;
data. Personal observation of a small sample would be an interesting&#13;
complement to a larger time use study which relies on recall of recent&#13;
events. Observations which could throw light on the intensity of work effort&#13;
would be particularly valuable. The analytical potential of the Botswana time&#13;
use study was greatly enhanced by the very detailed income information which&#13;
was simultaneously collected, and this should be continued in future&#13;
studies. Further, the analysis of time use data requires a larger number of&#13;
explanatory variables. In particular, it would be desirable to treat&#13;
household structure and household assets as endogenous variables. For this&#13;
purpose one would need to collect some information on the economic and&#13;
demographic history of households, on availability of relatives with whom a&#13;
large household could be formed, on relatives who have migrated and on&#13;
expectations regarding their return, and on the origin of asset holdings --&#13;
migrant savings or transfers, inheritance, bride price, gifts, etc.&#13;

Chapter 4:  The DistrLbution and Efficiency of Crop Production in Tribal&#13;
Areas of Botswana&#13;
Robert E.B. Lucas&#13;
4.1   Introduction&#13;
Crop farming is not a very major source of income in Botswana; its&#13;
value was originally estimated by the Rural Income Distribution Survey (RIDS)&#13;
at about 8.3 million Pula or some four percent of the GDP. 1 Such crop&#13;
growing as exists is almost entirely rainfed and therefore much affected by&#13;
periodic droughts. Nevertheless, the potential importance of crop farming to&#13;
Botswana has been emphasiLzed both in the Lipton report and in the Government's&#13;
initial commitmetnt (albeit on a small scale) to the Arable Land Development&#13;
Programme.2 Moreover, crop production per crop farming household is reported&#13;
to vary enormously by locality in RIDS (p. 4.31) as reproduced in Table 4.1:&#13;
Table 4.1: Mean Primary Income from Crops per Households&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Thus, household differences in crop production can potentially play a&#13;
significant role in determining overall income inequality.&#13;
The present paper, for these reasons, examines inter-family&#13;
variations in crop production within tribal (non-freehold) areas of&#13;
Botswana. In particular, three major lines of analysis are pursued. First, a&#13;
study of the distribution of inputs into crop farming across families&#13;
includes: (1) the allocation of tribal arable lands to households of various&#13;
types; (2) purchases of current inputs such as ploughing services and&#13;
fertilizer; (3) ownership of crop farming equipment; and (4) the allocation of&#13;
family labor time to crop growing. The next section, then analyzes&#13;
productivity in this arable sector and some of its determinants. Finally,&#13;
some issues and estimates on the question of profitability are presented.&#13;
4.2   The Distribution of Inputs&#13;
A. Land&#13;
The seminal, though dated, work on land tenure in Botswana is clearly&#13;
that of I. Schapera, Native Land Tenure in the Bechuanaland Protectorate,&#13;
(Lovedale Press, 1943). All land in the former "Native Reserves" essentially&#13;
belonged to the chief and tribe occupying the areas. Each married man was&#13;
entitled to sufficient arable land to grow crops for his family. Thus, each&#13;
household was given land according to its size, men with bigger families&#13;
receiving larger portions. Such land could be inherited by the man's children&#13;
or given or loaned to others, but not sold or rented. Inheritance was not&#13;
confined to the male line, for a father was required to set aside a field for&#13;
each of his daughters on marriage. This field should then be cultivated by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
the woman and her husband, but pass to one of their daughters upon the&#13;
mother's death. Additional land could not be cleared without permission from&#13;
the chief or his surrogate, so although extensive open land may have existed&#13;
it was not "free" for the taking. Indeed, In some areas, even by 1943,&#13;
overcrowding of some arable land was already reported. If a man left his land&#13;
temporarily, he could retain the land upon returning. But, land abandoned&#13;
permanently automatically reverted to the chief.&#13;
In a more recent study of land tenure in Kgatleng, Roberts (S.&#13;
Roberts, "Arable Land Disputes and Administrative Change in the Kgatleng,"&#13;
S.S.R.C.  Conference on Land Tenure in Botswana, University of Manchester,&#13;
England, March 1978) reports two very impori:ant shifts in this traditional&#13;
system. First, the centralized system of tribal land allotment caused such a&#13;
backlog of claims that the practice of self-allotment became prevalent. Self-&#13;
allotment amounted to individuals finding plots for themselves without resort&#13;
to the tribal authorities, and such self allotments were generally condoned&#13;
provided it did rLot result: in friction with other claimants to the land. In&#13;
particular, much of this self allotment encroached upon former grazing&#13;
lands.  The second important change reported by Roberts is in the transfer of&#13;
lands.  TraditiorLally, trLnsfers occurred in the form of loans and inheritance&#13;
within the sub-waLrd of the tribe. But as self-allotment proceeded, lands were&#13;
no longer blocked together in subwards and transfers increased outside of the&#13;
"extended family". Such transfers increasingly carried a price (often a beast&#13;
for one field), at first illegally but progressively more openly.    Thus, in&#13;
more recent times, purchases of arable lands seem to have become much more&#13;
common. ConversaLtions with District Officers and anthropologists working in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
Botswana suggest, however, that overt purchase remains rare except for cleared&#13;
land in which case payment is nominally for the work of clearing.&#13;
It is interesting to note that despite the very high land to&#13;
population ratio, at least cleared arable land is certainly not "free". To&#13;
what extent this is attributable to limited availability of (good or cleared)&#13;
cultivable land, to limited administrative assignment of lands to arable&#13;
purposes, or to economic pressures for alternative land use in cattle grazing&#13;
cannot be resolved here.&#13;
Rather, this sub-section proceeds to an examination of the net&#13;
outcome of these mechanisms of land allotment by 1974/75. RIDS asked each&#13;
household in the survey how much land they "possessed", although these data&#13;
were not reported in the main data file. Lands assigned to all members of the&#13;
interviewed household were included, no matter whether these lands were&#13;
ploughed or not. The quantity of land was self-reported by the household,&#13;
giving rise to certain inherent problems in the units of measurement. Almost&#13;
all households reporting land in RIDS did so in "acres", but these are African&#13;
acres which are not a fixed area of measurement but refer rather to number of&#13;
plough turns. As a measure of true area, the numbers reported obviously then&#13;
contain a certain degree of pure randomness or error. But it also seems&#13;
plausible the reported "acres" correlate to some extent with actual area.&#13;
Since there seems no inherent reason to expect any particular direction of&#13;
bias in the random portion, average errors should cancel out in looking across&#13;
households with different characteristics. Thus, in this sub-section factors&#13;
found to correlate with reported "acres" will be taken to be correlated with&#13;
the underlying true area component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Table 4.2 presents weighted averages of reported lands area by income&#13;
class and sex oE the household head, as well as the percentage of households&#13;
reporting lands. Only households actually reporting lands area are included&#13;
in the average "'acreage" figures since it is unclear whether the remaining&#13;
families have no land or simply failed to report lands. (Lands data are&#13;
unavailable for the samples from Kanye and Etsha).&#13;
Some 74 percent of rural households report having lands, and the&#13;
average area is about 8 'acres".   On the whole, female headed households are&#13;
estimated to have 35 percent less lands than male headed households, among&#13;
households with lands. rhis significant difference might be attributable to&#13;
at least two types of efi-ect.  On the one hand, families may tend to be&#13;
female-headed because they have less lands and in particular men from&#13;
households with relative]!y little land may tend to migrate within Botswana or&#13;
to the South African minets. On the other hand, a household may have less land&#13;
because it is female headed. With increased difficulty of ploughing for&#13;
households lacking men, and generally lower incomes pushing for liquidation of&#13;
assets, female-headed houiseholds may be more willing to sell off any lands&#13;
they initially a,cquire. Separation of these two effects involves some tricky&#13;
questions of timing, and cannot easily be disentangled from a one-shot&#13;
household survey.&#13;
Table 4.2 also disaggregates these results by income class of the&#13;
household. Income class is defined by gross available household income (see&#13;
RIDS for a precise definition) in Pula per year, divided by household size&#13;
measured in adult equivalents.   (Number of adults age 15 or over plus half the&#13;

The lowest income households, those with below 50 Pula per adult&#13;
equivalent in I'able 4.2 average only 6.6 "acres" amongst land holders, and the&#13;
highest income group has the largest average holding. Moreover, the lowest&#13;
income group has the second lowest proportion of households reporting any&#13;
lands. On the other hand, the highest income category has much the lowest&#13;
fraction of households reporting any lands. Thus, the upper middle income&#13;
households (151-350 Pula) average less lands given they possess, but possess&#13;
so much more often than the highest income group as to average more overall if&#13;
non-reporting iB interpreted as zero lands. It seems the very richest can&#13;
afford or are assigned more lands if they so choose, but more often elect to&#13;
focus their attentions on other forms of income earning, such as cattle.&#13;
In those panels of Table 4.2 differentiating by sex of household&#13;
head, the reason for so dloing should be apparent. Whereas 27 percent of male&#13;
headed households receive incomes below 101) Pula per adult equivalent, the&#13;
corresponding proportion of female headed households is 47 percent. The&#13;
greater incidence of poverty, the lack of male heads for ploughing, and the&#13;
sex difference in traditional land allotment procedures all warrant separate&#13;
examination of female headed households. 1Hot only do female headed households&#13;
average smaller areas of land overall, 6.2 acres as opposed to 9.6, and have a&#13;
lower reporting rate of lands possession, but even within each income class&#13;
female heads avetrage lesEt land area and in most cases lower chances of&#13;
reported possession. The reason for lower land holdings among female headed&#13;
households is apparently not merely because they have lower incomes to afford&#13;
possession and operation, but it is quite plausible they tend to be lower&#13;
income partly because they receive less land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
In the traditional system, land assignment is partly according to&#13;
family size. To the extent arable land may today be bought and sold, one&#13;
might also expect family size to influence land holdings through availability&#13;
of labor to till the land and through pressures of demand for food. Figure&#13;
4.1 plots piecewise linear regression estimates of lands area against the&#13;
number of adults (age 15+) in the household multiplied by the number of months&#13;
present within the household during the year of the RIDS survey. 3 Both among&#13;
male-headed and female-headed households there is a general tendency for those&#13;
with greater adult presence to display larger areas of lands reported.&#13;
However, given number of adults present, the female-headed households average&#13;
considerably smaller amounts of land within each category.&#13;
No matter whether the traditional or a more market-oriented system&#13;
rules, ability to plough is likely to influence land allocation. For the most&#13;
part ploughing is a man's task, though not exclusively. Absence of men can be&#13;
supplemented by hiring of ploughing services, or by reliance on other members&#13;
of the subward, but availability of adult men for ploughing within the family&#13;
is likely to prove cheaper and certainly more convenient. The latter is&#13;
particularly true given the importance of ploughing immediately after the&#13;
first rains. Taking the ploughing season as extending approximately from&#13;
November through February, the piece-wise linear regressions depicted in&#13;
Figure 4.2 therefore look at the number of men actually present in the&#13;
3 Persons reported "elsewhere", "died", or "location unknown", are not&#13;
included. Individuals of unknown age are counted as 50 percent in the&#13;
adult category, 50 percent in the child category. See Table A.1 in the&#13;

the appendix).&#13;
From Figure 4.2, it is clear that both within male-headed and female-&#13;
headed households, the area of land rises with the number of men present.&#13;
However, it is not absence of men in the female-headed household which reduces&#13;
the allocation of land, for given the number of men in every instance female-&#13;
headed households average less land. It is especially note-worthy that&#13;
female-headed households with no man present during ploughing average some 5&#13;
"acres", but in male-headed households where the head and all other adult&#13;
males are absen,t the average is about 8 "acres". Thus, it seems that it is&#13;
not own ploughing capacityj which reduces land allocation to the female-headed&#13;
household.&#13;
Figure 4.3 explores also the associLation between cattle ownership and&#13;
land allotment, depicting the piecewise regression results from Table A.3 of&#13;
the appendix.   In terms of technology, there is little reason to expect auy&#13;
association between these variables beyond ownership of sufficient cattle&#13;
(about 8 ploughing beasts, which may require a total herd of 20 animals) to do&#13;
one's ploughing.  But the association beyond this level is clear, land       -&#13;
assignment increases steadily with cattle owmed. In the traditional system,&#13;
this could only reflect undue influence of the big cattle owners in land&#13;
allotment through the tribal system. But with the emergence of a market for&#13;
arable lands, as described by Roberts (1978, op.cit.), an alternative&#13;
explanation exists: obviously, the wealthy cattle owners are better able to&#13;
afford lands as a general part of their portfolio of assets.    In addition,&#13;
crop farming in Botswana is a very risky business as rains vary from year to&#13;
year, and the wealthy would be better able to undertake this type of risk on a&#13;

larger scale than necessa.ry to feed their own family. It is particularly&#13;
interesting to note in Figure 4.3 that female-headed households with larger&#13;
numbers of cattle have at least as much arable land as male-headed equivalent&#13;
households. It seems the lesser possession of land of female-headed&#13;
households is nolt so much a question of ploughing ability, but partly a&#13;
question of lower incomes and capacity for affording lands, partly a question&#13;
of whatever influence in the tribal system iLs correlated with cattle&#13;
ownership.&#13;
So far, the analysis has been confined to examination of land&#13;
holdings against variables; each taken one at a time. However, Table 4.3&#13;
presents regression estimaLtes of the following equation:&#13;
Qn (LAND) = b + b   FEM + b2 CATL + b3 MEN + b4 RAIN + b5 FAM      (4.1)&#13;
Estimation is by means of "ordinary" least squares and standard&#13;
errors of coefficients are presented in parentheses directly beneath each&#13;
parameter estimate. Each observation is one household possessing land. The&#13;
variables included in the analysis are family size (including children as&#13;
half) FAM, number of men present during ploughing MEN, number of cattle owned&#13;
CATL, average rainfall RAINi, and whether this is a female-headed household&#13;
FEM.  These included variables are defined more precisely in the appendix.&#13;
Even given the values of other variables held constant, it remains&#13;
true that reported lands increase with family size. On average, an increase&#13;
in family size by 12 adult month equivalents raises lands held by some 8&#13;
percent.  But the composition of the household also matters, since given&#13;
family size and the other variables held fixed, each extra adult male present&#13;

during ploughing season raises land allotment by 9 percent. It might be noted&#13;
at this juncture that the direction of causality is indeterminate from these&#13;
results, of course. In particular it may either be true that households with&#13;
more men availalble acquire more land, or t'hat men'either remain or indeed join&#13;
households with more fields.&#13;
Given lhousehold size, men present, and the other factors held fixed,&#13;
ownership of caittle remains positively associated with arable holdings: each&#13;
10 extra cattle are associated with a 2 percent increase in lands area on&#13;
average. Also, given the other elements, rainfall is positively associated&#13;
with "acreage". Indeed, the effect is very large -- an increase in 100 mms.&#13;
of typical annual rain is associated with a 27 percent increase in reported&#13;
acres" on average.&#13;
Finally, given these attributes of households and their locations, it&#13;
is estimated that female-headed households average 14 percent less land than&#13;
comparable male-headed households. This effect is so much less than the&#13;
simple differential reported earlier as to be statistically, insignificantly&#13;
different from no effect at all.   At least a good part of the observed lower&#13;
lands areas held by households headed by women is explicable in terms of their&#13;
cattle ownershilp, location and other factors entering this multivariate view.&#13;

over the crop cycle. Ta'ble 4.4 presents an analysis of such expenditures by&#13;

percentage of households reporting some expenditures of each type among&#13;
households reporting crops grown and lands available. V indicates value of&#13;
the expenditure measured in Thebe (Pula/100) per reported "acre" of land.&#13;
Lookiqg across the overall figures in Table 4.4 it is immediately&#13;
obvious that with the exception of ploughing services, purchased inputs are a&#13;
rarity.  For example, onLy 4 percent of households report any expenditure on&#13;
petrol for a tractor, and even smaller proportions report expenditures on&#13;
other items except ploughing services. On the latter, the average household&#13;
spends about 45 Thebe per "acre", this expenditure being made by 17 percent of&#13;
crop-producing households.&#13;
On average, a higher proportion of female-headed households purchase&#13;
inputs and also spend more per acre on these inputs, with the exception of&#13;
fertilizer.  Particularly interesting is the great difference in purchases of&#13;
ploughing services by female-headed households as compared to male-headed.&#13;
Twenty-five perc:ent of households headed by women growing crops report&#13;
expenditures on ploughing services at an average rate among purchasing and&#13;
non-purchasing households of one Pula per "'acre". It seems that lack of cattle&#13;
for ploughing anLd perhaps; of men in the female-headed households is&#13;
compensated by purchasing; ploughing servicets. This argument would be&#13;
supported by the observed decline, in Table 4.4, both in proportion of&#13;
households hiring ploughing services and in expenditure per "acre" as the&#13;
number of men present during ploughing season rises. Twenty-six percent of&#13;
crop-growing households with no males present hire ploughing services, but&#13;
only 6 percent of households with four or more men. Notice also, that although&#13;
fertilizer inputs are rare, they increase in frequency and amount with the&#13;
number of men present. Ihis feature presumably reflects the fact that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
households with more men can afford fertilizer (out of wage earnings of men in&#13;
the mines or elsewhere).&#13;
The modern farming inputs -- fertilizer, chemicals and petrol for&#13;
tractors - all tend to increase in frequency of use as number of cattle owned&#13;
rises, presumably partly reflecting ease of financing. However, since lands&#13;
area also tends to rise with number of cattle, it is less clearly true that&#13;
expenditure on these items per acre rises with number of cattle. Purchases of&#13;
ploughing services show no clear pattern with regard to cattle ownership.&#13;
Note though, that 61 percent of households owning more than 80 cattle report&#13;
hiring ploughing services: presumably their own cattle are too far removed&#13;
from the lands for use in ploughing or else larger scale cattle breeders,&#13;
focusing on beef production, would rather hire tractor ploughing than&#13;
depreciate their cattle as draft power.&#13;
Fertilizers and chemicals are found not to be used at all among&#13;
farmers with small holdings. On the whole, these expenditures tend to rise&#13;
with holdings though surprisingly those households with more than 100 "acres"&#13;
report no such purchases.&#13;
Frequency of purchases of ploughing services shows no distinct&#13;
pattern among smaller compared to larger lands. Largely because of this, one&#13;
finds expenditures on ploughing services per "acre" being much the highest for&#13;
those with only one acre, and declining fairly steadily from there.&#13;
Households with just one acre spend on average 4.05 Pula on ploughing&#13;
services, but those with more than 100 "acres" spend less than one Thebe per&#13;
"acre". Either there are very rapidly declining costs per acre charged for&#13;
ploughing services, or those with large holdings are better equipped to do&#13;
their own ploughing -- a point to which we shall return.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
The use of fertilizer tends to be greater in areas with more rain in&#13;
a typical year. On the other hand expenditures on petrol for a tractor are&#13;
higher in the dry areas which seems rather surprising. The other purchased&#13;
inputs display no particular pattern with regard to amount of rainfall.    It is&#13;
also true that expenditures display no obvious pattern across the various&#13;
sizes of village.&#13;
The lowest income households report no purchases of any of the modern&#13;
crop inputs. Indeed, from Table 4.4 the consequences of a positive income&#13;
elasticity of demand or of higher income households' access to fertilizer,&#13;
tractor use and even chemicals is apparent. This immediately raises questions&#13;
as to the distr:Lbutional consequences of programs to subsidize and promote&#13;
further use of such inputs, in Botswana as in most LDCs, unless some mechanism&#13;
is found to enhance use also by lower income households.    On the other hand,&#13;
all strata hire ploughing services with no clear pattern of variability in&#13;
extent or expenditure per "acre" across income classes.&#13;
Finally, in the last horizontal panel of Table 4.4 separate figures&#13;
are reported for the Barolong Farms region.    The exceptionally high usage of&#13;
fertilizer, chemicals and petrol for tractors is immediately obvious. Quite&#13;
why this region behaves so differently with respect to inputs is beyond the&#13;
scope of thLs study, though we may note at least the geographical location of&#13;
Barolong on the South African border and the long history of permanent crop&#13;
farms in this area as opFiosed to seasonal lands dwellings in other tribal&#13;
areas.&#13;
C. Farm Equipment&#13;
The stock of equipment held by each household is evaluated in RIDS by&#13;
taking an inventory of each type of equipment separately and evaluating this&#13;

list at given prices in the office after the survey. Although this method has&#13;
the obvious disadvantage of ignoring the age structure of the equipment, in a&#13;
subsistence economy where records of purchase date and price are simply not&#13;
kept it probably provides not an unreasonable approximation.&#13;
Adding together the items of equipment associated with crop&#13;
husbandry, 5 Table 4.5 shows the distribution of this equipment by value. The&#13;
overall average value of equipment is 176 Pula, but it is apparent that male-&#13;
headed households are better equipped for crop farming, averaging about 72&#13;
percent more equipment by value per crop producing household as compared to&#13;
female-headed households. Also, the amount of equipment rises sharply, though&#13;
slightly less than in proportion, as the number of men present during the&#13;
ploughing season increases. This observation may generally be attributed to&#13;
three plausible types of effects: (i) the savings necessary for equipment&#13;
accumulation may largely be funded out of earnings of men from the mines, the&#13;
amount of funds increasing with the number of men returned. (ii) Men may tend&#13;
to join or not to leave those households which are better equipped. (iii) If&#13;
equipment closely complements typical male crop activities - such as&#13;
ploughing -- households with more men would have more incentive to invest in&#13;
crop related equipment.&#13;
Amount of crop equipment is also positively associated with cattle&#13;
owned, presumably reflecting a general wealth effect. Although households&#13;
with only one "acre" of land are least well-equipped as would be expected,&#13;
there is no clear-cut tendency for increase in endowment of equipment until&#13;
5 The items of equipment included are: tractor, plough, harrow, planter&#13;
sledge, handmill, wagon or cart, granary and cultivator.&#13;

lands area exceeds 15 acres. Among the households with larger areas of land,&#13;
there is an obvious tendency to be better equipped for working this land.&#13;
It is also estimated that crop equipment available is greater in&#13;
areas with heavier "normal" rains. Households in areas with more than 600&#13;
mms. report more than 2.5 times the value of crop equipment possessed by those&#13;
in the 300-400 mms. belt. Whether this is a consequence of greater wealth in&#13;
the rainier areas or of higher contribution to production of equipment in such&#13;
areas is not discernible from this simple uninvariate analysis.&#13;
The larger villages are better equipped for crop farming, per crop&#13;
producing household. The value of equipment for a typical crop-growing&#13;
household in the largest villages is about 63 percent higher than in the&#13;
smallest villages. And again in the last panel of Table 4.5 the outstanding&#13;
degree of capital intensity of farming in Barolong is obvious. Indeed the&#13;
average value of equipment per crop farming household in Barolong exceeds even&#13;
that among the highest income group of households, despite a fairly sharp and&#13;
steady rise in equipment per household across income classes.&#13;
Table 4.6 displays the percentage of crop-growing households&#13;
possessing at least one of each of the crop equipment types distinguished.&#13;
Quite obviously ploughs are most commonly owned, though double row ploughs are&#13;
comparatively rare. The equipment types associated with more modern farming&#13;
techniques - planters, cultivators, harrows, tractors -- were also not common&#13;
as of 1974-75, though they are certainly increasing. We have seen, however,&#13;
that access to tractors may be far more common than ownership, through hiring&#13;
of ploughing services.&#13;

the day prior to interview for five of the twelve visits to each household.&#13;
The classification scheme adopted for activities in RIDS includes "working for&#13;
others - for wage, salary or goods", and "crop husbandry - all activities&#13;
connected with growing crops". Given the inclusion of wage work as an&#13;
activity, one might expect the crop husbandry activity to refer to working on&#13;
one's own land. But Table 4.7 shows the fraction of time reported working on&#13;
crops occurring among persons in households with no reported crop output.&#13;
This ranges from 11 percent for female adults to 19 percent for male adults.&#13;
Several potential explanations might be postulated:&#13;
i)   The survey might, of course, have misreported outputs, activities or&#13;
both, but the scale involved seems to remove this as the major cause&#13;
(one hopes!).&#13;
ii) Crop failure is not uncommon in Botswana, and the observed time inputs&#13;
with zero output may be such instances, but the harvest in the year of&#13;
the survey was not bad.&#13;
iii) The phasing of RIDS was very unfortunate from the perspective of crop&#13;
studies. Most of the crops reported are those from the 1973-74&#13;
season, harvested in March through June of 1974 - the first four&#13;
visits of the survey. Thus, only time inputs in this early period&#13;
refer to the actual harvest recorded, the remainder going towards the&#13;
1974-75 harvest, only the early part of which is included. Any study&#13;
of crop farming from this study must therefore assume some consistency&#13;
of inputs by households across the crop years, but time inputs could&#13;
have been observed in 1974-75 even though no crop was grown in 1973-&#13;
74.&#13;

iv) Tribal affiliations in Botswana are characterized by understood&#13;
commitments to help one another - especially within the sub-ward --&#13;
without payment of anything likely to be deemed a wage. Thus, time&#13;
spent on crops, even though not for wages or goods, may nonetheless&#13;
actually be work performed on lands and crops of other households.&#13;
With these reservations in mind, Table 4.8 proceeds to examine time&#13;
reported spent on crop husbandry but only among households actually reporting&#13;
some output. The figures in Table 4.8 are estimates of the total numbers of&#13;
hours spent in 12 months by all individuals in the household falling within a&#13;
child/adult, male/female class. 6 Essentially, the idea is to gain some sense&#13;
of the total time input by family members of a particular type.&#13;
It is clear that adult women provide most of the labor time on&#13;
crops. For a typical crop-producing family, the adult female members&#13;
contribute some 610 hours a year working on crops. In fact, the women put in&#13;
many more hours in total than the children and men combined. The girls are&#13;
estimated to provide the next largest input of time at 176 hours a year,&#13;
followed by men and then boys.&#13;
In female-headed households, total time input into crop husbandry by&#13;
boys and girls exceeds that in male-headed households, as does time input by&#13;
women. To some extent this is presumably compensating for the lower time&#13;
6 The estimate is actually obtained by multiplying the average number of hours&#13;
reported worked yesterday on crops per visit in which activities are&#13;
recorded for the household, by 30 days per month and 12 months per year.&#13;
Note that it is not unreasonable to count 30 days a month since&#13;
observations include activities on all seven days at random. This also&#13;
assumes the five, intermittent months in which activities are reported are&#13;
an unbiased set, though in fact the very busiest month of December is&#13;
omitted.&#13;

provided by men within the female-headed households, but to what degree it is&#13;
a result of children and the women taking up tasks done by men in the male-&#13;
headed households, (where male input is seen in Table 4.8 to be higher),&#13;
cannot be discerned from these data. That women and children are to some&#13;
extent substituting for men seems, however, likely since their generally&#13;
higher contributions are on smaller areas of land on average. But it is also&#13;
true they are working with less equipment which would tend to require a&#13;
greater input to achieve a given performance.&#13;
Increases in family size, as measured by adults multiplied by months&#13;
present, are accompanied by greater inputs of time to crop husbandry by all&#13;
four family member groups. Of course, it was also observed in Table 4.3 that&#13;
larger families have more land. Together, these suggest either that people&#13;
attach themselves to households having more lands, or that households of&#13;
greater size tend to acquire more land, such that extra crop work is performed&#13;
by each group as the household is bigger. 7 At least in this sense, extra&#13;
household members are not redundant to crop production. 8&#13;
Total input by adult males is found, in Table 4.8, to increase as the&#13;
number of men present during the ploughing season increases. Indeed, it is&#13;
estimated that each additional man contributes a greater number of hours over&#13;
the year. Yet the reported hours per man per year are very low, even if they&#13;
are only approximately correct. It is then difficult to imagine that other&#13;
7 Some care must be taken, for an increase in hours performed by each group&#13;
may result in a total fall in hours worked as the composition of the&#13;
household can also shift.&#13;
8 Even so, it is in principle feasible that people could be removed from the&#13;
rural sector and even from crop production without loss of crop output.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 105 -&#13;
demands on men's time, in the rural areas, are so pressing the fourth man's&#13;
time in crop farming could not easily be made up by the other three if the&#13;
fourth went to the mines.   This would only be true if the work of all men were&#13;
of necessity concentrated in a very short spell, for example with all of them&#13;
working full time at ploughing after the rains. But RIDS actually shows the&#13;
time of men spent on crop husbandry surprisingly widely spread over the crop&#13;
cycle, (though no data are reported for December, the main ploughing month),&#13;
Note also there seems to be no simple correlation between number of men&#13;
present and time spent by other groups on crop care. If correct, this would&#13;
tend to indicate one of two things: (i) Either there is not a strict division&#13;
of tasks with children, for example, performing bird-scaring, women harvesting&#13;
and men ploughing so that extra time spent by men may not be in ploughing;&#13;
(ii) or there is not a fixed relationship between tasks - twice as much&#13;
ploughing does nol: imply twice as much bird-scaring. No doubt the truth is&#13;
some combination of these.   Combined with the results comparing male and&#13;
f-emale-headed households, -lt would however seem, within the confines of this&#13;
mninvariate framework that male adult time input is unlikely to be a&#13;
complement rather than a substitute for inputs by other household members.&#13;
That time spent in crop husbandry does not31decline with number of&#13;
cattle owned is somewhat unexpected, though of course this may be misleading&#13;
in being a uninvariate view. With more cattle, one might have anticipated the&#13;
time of boys and perhaps girls to be drawn out of crops and substituted into&#13;
cattle herding, but perhaps the absolute time commitment to the former is so&#13;
small as to obviate substitution. Also, bigger cattle owners have larger&#13;
areas of land. On the other hand, the bigger cattle owners were also found to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
be better equipped for crop farming, and perhaps the larger lands areas are&#13;
simply farmed using more equipment with no more labor.&#13;
More surprising is the discovery of no correlation between reported&#13;
time in crop activity and area of lands. Other things equal this would lead&#13;
us to anticipate lower yields on the larger holdings. But larger lands areas&#13;
are associated with more equipment and fertilizer, and the net outcome in&#13;
terms of yields must await investigation in the next section of this paper.&#13;
Family labor time spent on crops is less for each of the groups in&#13;
the more arid areas. This is consistent with the findings of smaller lands,&#13;
less equipment and less fertilizer in such areas. The disincentives to&#13;
farming in arid zones obviously dominate the need for greater contributions to&#13;
achieve a given output for feeding one's family.&#13;
Finally, within each sex/maturity category in Table 4.8 the greatest&#13;
amount of time spent on crop activities tends to be in the lowest income&#13;
class. This finding suggests that if marginal changes reflect the average a&#13;
policy to stimulate crop production would, ceteris paribus, tend to absorb&#13;
more labor from the lower income classes.&#13;
4.3 Productivity and Some Determinants of Production&#13;
A.   Output and Land Productivity&#13;
The total value of crops produced over 12 months per crop-producing&#13;
household is broken down in Table 4.9 by type of household. On average crop-&#13;
producing households generate 134 Pula worth of crops in the tribal areas.&#13;
Dividing by reported "acres", this amount to a yield of 17.61 Pula per "acre"&#13;
overall.&#13;

Among crop-producing households, male-headed households average more&#13;
than twice the output of female-headed households. But it is also true that&#13;
the former report greater lands areas, and the estimated yields per "acre" are&#13;
essentially the same - female-headed households actually showing a slightly&#13;
higher yield. This does not mean that male-headed and female-headed&#13;
households are approximately equally "efficient" in producing crops: yield per&#13;
acre considers one input only - land - and ignores questions of labor,&#13;
fertilizer and equipment use in generating this yield. To the general question&#13;
of "efficiency" we shall return later.&#13;
Output rises consistently both with adult presence and number of men&#13;
present during ploughing. Thus, households with four or more men produce&#13;
about 6 times as much crops by value as households with no men. Yet neither&#13;
measure of family size demonstrates any obvious association with yield per&#13;
acre.&#13;
Crop income per crop-producing household is positively associated&#13;
with ownership of cattle, consequently magnifying income inequality from&#13;
agriculture generally. Also, despite higher land areas alloted to bigger&#13;
cattle owners there does seem a weak upward trend in yield per acre with&#13;
greater cattle ownership up to 80 head, followed by a sharp decline among the&#13;
biggest cattle owners. This sharp decline may reflect more extensive farming&#13;
techniques among the bigger cattle owners as would seem to be reflected in the&#13;
correlation with lands size to be seen shortly. The general upward trend will&#13;
be discussed in the context of the multivariate analysis to follow.&#13;
Output, as might be expected, generally rises with reported number of&#13;
"acres". To this rule, there are, however two exceptions: Output is&#13;
disproportionately high for one "acre" households, and low for those with more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -&#13;
than 100  acres".   At least three main types of explanations suggest&#13;
themselves: (i) The levetl of other inputs - such as labor, equipment,&#13;
fertilizer and rain - may be such as to reflect a very different use of&#13;
these lands in the extreme size categories. One "acre" lands may be farmed&#13;
very intensively even compared to 2-3 acre lands; 100 acre lands being&#13;
operated very extensively.   (ii) This may be a reflection of lands area&#13;
reporting. Families having one field may have tended to report this as one&#13;
acre  even though bigger than the lands of some families reporting more&#13;
acres". At th,e other ead of the scale it is conceivable the big land owners&#13;
know the true area of their land in European acres and have reported this&#13;
rather than African areas. Perhaps then, some households in the 30-100 "acre"&#13;
category really have more lands than the comparative figures would show.&#13;
(iii) Only a small number of households report more than 100    acres", so&#13;
estimates in thiLs range are presented with relatively less confidence.&#13;
It is s,triking ithough that even in the range of 2 through 100 acres,&#13;
where output indeed risens with area reported, yield per acre at the same time&#13;
declines quite steadily. Errors in "acreage" reporting not withstanding this&#13;
finding is highly suggesl:ive of declining crop yields as lands size&#13;
increases.  The potential. reasons are, of course, manifold.&#13;
Househcild crop production is higher per crop-producing household in&#13;
zones with more rain, but: yield per acre displays no systematic pattern.&#13;
Income from crops per crop-producing household, is higher in the largest&#13;
villages but does not increase at all systematically with village size, and&#13;
yield per acre displays an exact converse pattern to output across village&#13;
sizes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -&#13;
In one sense the observed result, that the higher the income of&#13;
households per adult equivalent the higher the output of crops among crop&#13;
producing households, should be anticipated. Yet in a society like Botswana,&#13;
where as we have seen crop production is a relatively unimportant source of&#13;
income, it is not so obvious this should be the case. A part, but not all, of&#13;
this difference is attributable to size of lands, for we see output per "acre"&#13;
rising at least across the three lowest income categories, though it is&#13;
relatively steady thereafter. (It should be remembered in comparing Table 4.9&#13;
and 4.2 that average output per acre is not, of course, equal to average&#13;
output divided by average acres. Table 4.9 reports the former.) The rise in&#13;
output per "acre" across lower income classes presumably reflects to some&#13;
degree the lower levels of equipment and modern inputs observed earlier. This&#13;
would also be true for Barolong, where output is obviously outstanding and&#13;
even output per "acre" comparatively very high. (The figure reported for&#13;
Barolong is slightly higher than the original figure in the RIDS report,&#13;
reproduced in Table 4.1 owing to slight differences in sample).&#13;
B. Some Determinants of Production&#13;

Where:&#13;
Q        Is total value cf crops reported grown (sold, harvested and eaten, or&#13;
estimated eaten from the field--evaluated at producers' prices in&#13;
Pula. The value of own or purchased seeds is subtracted from&#13;
output.&#13;

CHLD     Number of children (age 14 or less) multiplied by months present in&#13;
year (as defined above).   Persons of unknown age are counted as half&#13;
child, lhalf adult.&#13;
MALES    Number of adult mzen multiplied by months present in year.   (Persons&#13;
of unknown sex are counted as half male, half female).&#13;
FEMALES  Identical measure for adult women.&#13;
FERT     Pula spent on fertilizer in 12 months.&#13;
PETROL   Pula spent on petrol for a tractor, specifically for work on crops.&#13;
(It is not altogether clear whether this refers to own or other's&#13;
tractors).&#13;
OTHER    Expenditure on other items specifically related to crop husbandry&#13;
(chemicals, service on equipment, tools, spare parts, wage labor,&#13;
"other" costs, petrol other than tractor) and miscellaneous&#13;
expenditures (vehicle licenses, etc.) directly attributed to crop&#13;
farming.&#13;
BARO     Equals one if the household is in Blarolong, zero otherwise.&#13;
CATL     Number of cattle, excluding calves, owned by the household.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112 -&#13;
Before discussing the estimates of (4.2) a few words on specification&#13;
and estimation are in order.   The state of the art on estimation of production&#13;
functions would advocate estimation of a profit or cost function in preference&#13;
to a production function, assuming competitive markets. But prices paid for&#13;
inputs by individual households are not available in RIDS. Nor indeed are&#13;
many of the markets - such as that for land -- well developed. Nonetheless&#13;
one might wish to consider the production function a part of a wider system of&#13;
equations including factor demand functions.   But attempts to estimate (4.2)&#13;
by two stage least squares with land, capital and purchased inputs as&#13;
endogenous variables failed to identify appropriate instruments.&#13;
Thus, (4.2) is estimated by "ordinary" least squares. However, for&#13;
reasons discussed in section 4.2 we may anticipate that land in particular is&#13;
measured with error. To correct for this errors-in-variables problem an&#13;
instrumental variables approach is taken, using estimates of equation (4.1)&#13;
reported in Table 4.3 to predict values of&#13;
LAND.&#13;
Households reporting less than one Pula worth of crop output are&#13;
excluded. These low output households could be a consequence of misreporting,&#13;
coding, punching errors or of crop failure.&#13;
Equation (4.2) embraces terms such as Qn(k).Qn (MALES).     Other&#13;
log.log multiplicative terms were also explored, between land and labor,&#13;
capital and land, etc.   However, the data proved insufficiently rich to&#13;
discern significant coefficients on such terms, so that a general translog&#13;
specification could not be supported by these data.&#13;
A number of other contributing elements were also explored but not&#13;
included in the analysis presented here. (i) It is found that even given the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -&#13;
differences in amounts of land, capital, family composition and other&#13;
contributing factors included, female-headed households still tend to display&#13;
a lower level of crop production than male-headed households (about 15 percent&#13;
lower), but thiLs effect is statistically indistinguishable from zero. 9&#13;
(ii) Also the quantity of rain in the region, whether on average over the&#13;
previous five years or in the year of the survey's harvest, has no effect&#13;
separate fram that of the included elements. 10    (iii)  Surprisingly, the most&#13;
prevalent of purchased inputs, ploughing services, also is found to have no&#13;
separate effect. Certainly, one should not conclude from this that ploughing&#13;
services contribute nothing to output, but rather that the data are not&#13;
sufficiently rich to discern a separate effect given the extensive list of&#13;
contributing elements already included. (iv) Finally, it is often found in&#13;
other contexts that education, at least of decision makers, contributes to&#13;
output. 11 This may be true owing to more "efficient" decisions being made by&#13;
better educated persons, because the better educated are more productive&#13;
workers, or because education is associated with easier access to markets,&#13;
higher quality of land or other hidden contributing elements. 12 In this&#13;
9 That is, the null-hypothesis of zero difference cannot be rejected with 95&#13;
perceni: confidence on a one-tailed test.&#13;
10  If land area is excluded, rain plays a positive and "significant" role.&#13;
If both are inciLuded, land is "significant" but not rain.   This is&#13;
true no matter whether the reported area or the instrumental&#13;
variables approach is adopted.&#13;
11 For a survey of much of this material, see D. Jamison and L. Lau, "Farmer&#13;
Education and Farm Efficiency", mimeo, World Bank, November, 1978.&#13;
12 Reverse causality is also possible - that households who are better off&#13;
and produce more crops are in a mcire advantageous position to educate&#13;
their members.  This direction of causality is generally ignored in&#13;
the literature.&#13;

study, it is found that output indeed tends to be correlated with education of&#13;
the most highly educated adult present in the household - output being&#13;
slightly higher if Standard 4 is reached, higher still if Form 3 is achieved,&#13;
and highest for higher education. But statistically there is little&#13;
confidence in this finding.&#13;
The estimates of three variants of equation (4.2) are presented in&#13;
Table 4.10 with standard errors of coefficients in parentheses.&#13;
In the earlier tables it was seen that area of land is positively&#13;
associated with output. But it was also shown in Section 4.2 that lands area&#13;
is positively correlated with family size and with equipment. Nonetheless it&#13;
is found that, even given the composition of household, equipment and other&#13;
included variables, land does contribute positively to production. On average&#13;
it is estimated that a one percent increase in lands area, even given no&#13;
change in other inputs, increases output by about .62 percent. Stated&#13;
otherwise, an expansion in lands area by one acre for the typical household&#13;
would increase the value of crop production by 10 Pula given no change in&#13;
average inputs of other factors. 13&#13;
Equipment is also found to play a significant role in output&#13;
determination, such that a doubling of equipment is estimated to produce a 6&#13;
percent rise in output. On average, crop output is estimated to be 1.90 Pula&#13;
per Pula's worth of equipment, 14 implying that an investment of one Pula in&#13;
crop equipment would contribute about 16 Theba's worth of extra output for a&#13;
13 This estimate is based on the weighted mean output and lands area as&#13;
reported in Table 4.9 and Table 4.2.&#13;
14 This figure is actually an unweighted geometric mean based on the&#13;
regression data.&#13;

typical household. RIDS postulates a 10 percent rate of depreciation on&#13;
agricultural equipment. Thus the accounting rate of return on an incremental&#13;
Pula of investment is about 16 percent gross of depreciation or 6 percent,&#13;
net. The more meaningful figure, however, is the economic rate of return&#13;
which recognizes the initial one Pula cost with increased output spread over&#13;
the life of the equipment, and this figure is calculated to be 7.5 percent. 15&#13;
On the whole, the role of family labor inputs into crop production&#13;
proved the least satisfactory part of this analysis.     Initial experimentation&#13;
with reported activity time spent on crop work revealed little relationship&#13;
with output. One might suggest at least four reasons for this: 16 (i) It&#13;
seems probable there is substantial error in reporting this activity time;&#13;
(ii) perhaps even among families with positive crop output some of the&#13;
reported crop work is actually on others' lands; (iii) conversely, own&#13;
household time may be quite an incomplete measure of labor input despite&#13;
negligible amounts of wage payment; (iv) finally, there is the problem&#13;
mentioned earlier that part of the reported crop time does not refer to the&#13;
year of the recorded harvest. Having rejected this approach, an alternative&#13;
examination of the role of family size is reported here. In particular the&#13;
household members are divided into three -- children (14 years old and less),&#13;
adult males, and adult females -- and the number of months over the year in&#13;
which members are present in the household counted. The emergent results&#13;
prove interesting.&#13;
15 This is the integral rate of return on a one Pula investment generating 16&#13;
Theba per year for 10 years.&#13;
16 To this list must be added the likelihood of specification error.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117 -&#13;
If crop equipment is excluded from the items held fixed in examining&#13;
the effect of family composition on output, then output is found to increase&#13;
with the presence of children, men and of women, though in the case of men&#13;
there is little statistical confidence in this positive contribution. (See&#13;
regression 1 in Table 4.10). An additional effect is also studied. If there&#13;
is a fairly strict division of tasks in crop husbandry, then for example the&#13;
more men who worlk at ploughing the more one would expect output to rise with&#13;
extra weeding done by women:   men and women would tend to complement each&#13;
other's work.   Or the other hand, if absence of men results in women taking up&#13;
male tasks, then the contribution of women to output would increase as the&#13;
availability of men declines:   men and women are substitutes for each other in&#13;
crop work. This study finds that men and women are indeed substitutes. Thus,&#13;
departure of men to the mines tends (other things equal) to enhance rather&#13;
than limit the contribution of women to crop farming.&#13;
But clearly equipment should be given a separate role in examining&#13;
crop production determinants.   The insertion of capital into the study (in&#13;
regression 2, Table 4.10) does not change the direction of observed positive&#13;
roles of family members or the substitutability of men and women, but reduces&#13;
the estimated size of the effects such that only the role of children is&#13;
statistically distinguishable from zero with much confidence. 17 It would&#13;
seem that the role of adults of both sexes is strongly associated with&#13;
equipment availability. An extension of the analysis to allow for the&#13;
incremental contribution of adults in production to depend upon equipment&#13;
17  Note this is not a problem of collinearity since standard errors do not&#13;
blow up nor signs reverse, but is a simple question of excluded&#13;
variable bias.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 118 -&#13;
possessed (regression 3 in Table 4.10) finds an association in this particular&#13;
form of a positive type, but carrying minimal statistical significance.&#13;
With the strong warning that not too much confidence should be placed&#13;
in the estimates for adults, let us briefly consider the family input&#13;
findings. For the typical household, it is estimated that an increase in&#13;
family size in the form of an extra month in which one child is present would&#13;
increase crop output by about 26 Theba. 18 The effect of an increase in male&#13;
and female adult presence depends on presence of the opposite sex as shown in&#13;
Table 4.11. These estimated contributions are both generally low, 19 and&#13;
display a very rapid decline with availability of the opposite sex. 20 It is&#13;
not then surprising on this account that men find mine work extremely&#13;
attractive. If even approximately correct, it would follow that the ability&#13;
of crop farming in the tribal areas, as presently organized, meaningfully to&#13;
absorb extra labor of either sex is negligible. Only if other inputs are&#13;
simultaneously increased can such absorption be seriously contemplated.21&#13;
18 Of course, it would probably matter whether this month is May (harvest) or&#13;
August (off-season). The statements in the text refer though to&#13;
increase in availability following the pattern of household presence&#13;
observed in the average crop-producing household.&#13;
19 The mean monthly wage of rural adults is found to be for males, 49 Pula,&#13;
for females 28 Pula. However, it is true that farm workers working&#13;
for wages earn substantially less, as do the uneducated. See Lucas,&#13;
next chapter.&#13;
20 Unweighted geometric means of average household presence of adults are 23&#13;
months for women and 13 months for men. This implies only an 11&#13;
Theba per month contribution for an extra woman-month and no positive&#13;
contribution for men in an average household.&#13;
21  Indeed according to present estimates not even increased inputs of other&#13;
elements would boost the contribution of men, but one suspects this&#13;
may be attributable to a lack of significant interaction effects of&#13;
capital in the present specification and at the observed levels of&#13;
capital.&#13;

Fertilizer, petrol for a tractor and "other" purchased inputs each&#13;
are found to contribute significantly to household crop production. A one&#13;
percent increase in fertilizer is estimated to be associated with a .38&#13;
percent increase in output, .16 percent for petrol, and .20 percent for&#13;
"other" inputs.  These results are unreasonably high, given the low average&#13;
level of their use. 22 Being measures associated with more progressive&#13;
techniques, it is plausible these measures are reflecting other causes also,&#13;
such as higher quality land or better decision making and management&#13;
techniques (though the estimated effects are reduced hardly at all if&#13;
education of the most highly educated adult is inserted into the regression).&#13;
The Barolong Farms generally use more progressive techniques of&#13;
farming. But even comparing households with the same amounts of land,&#13;
equipment, household composition and purchased inputs, a typical Barolong&#13;
household still produces about 160 percent more in crops per year than&#13;
households elsewhere. Indeed, given the quite different levels of inputs&#13;
observed for Barolong Farms throughout this paper, one might suspect this&#13;
region really possesses a quite distinct production function. Separate&#13;
regressions were therefore estimated for Barolong and for the rest of the&#13;
country, but no major differences in estimated coefficients emerged.&#13;
Finally, it is also found that bigger cattle owning households&#13;
produce more crops by value. This fact remains true, according to our&#13;
estimates, even after removing the expanded output attributable to larger&#13;
amounts of equipment, fertilizer, etc. associated with cattle owning. Quite&#13;
22  Given average use of these inputs, the implied increase in output per&#13;
incremental Pula's worth of each purchased input is well in excess&#13;
of one Pula for the average household.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 121 -&#13;
what this estimated effect reflects is unclear. It seems unlikely to&#13;
represent merely the ability to plough for oneself using cattle power, if only&#13;
because purchased ploughiag services are found not to affect output&#13;
significantly. Additional possibilities would certainly include the&#13;
likelihood of higher quality land allotted to bigger cattle owners, and&#13;
perhaps better farming techniques.&#13;
4.4 Profits and Profitability&#13;
This closing section of the paper addresses the level of profits&#13;
obtained from farming and some measures of profitability. The work is divided&#13;
into two parts, the first considering the measurement of profit and presenting&#13;
a breakdown of profit by household and locational attributes. The second part&#13;
considers the question of profitability and scale of operation.&#13;
A. Profits: Measurement and Values&#13;
Profits are generally defined as value of output minus costs of&#13;
inputs. It is clear, then, that from output ought to be deducted purchases&#13;
such as ploughing services, wage labor, seeds, etc.    But in tribal areas of&#13;
Botswana, at least: family labor is not purchased. Yet zero price does not&#13;
imply "free". If family workers were not to work on crops, they might be able&#13;
to earn wages instead or at: least spend time generating household income&#13;
through some other activity. To ignore these costs would overstate the&#13;
profitability of crop farming - especially for those households applying&#13;
greater amounts of family labor.&#13;
This raises the difficult question of how to evaluate family labor&#13;
costs. The method adopted here is to price labor at the wage the worker could&#13;
receive if working for wages. In Chapter 5, I undertake a multivariate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 122 -&#13;
analysis of the effects of schooling, age, and village size on wage earnings&#13;
among rural men and women. That analysis finds even for persons with&#13;
comparable schooling and age, work as a farm laborer pays far less than other&#13;
types of work on average. On the presumption that persons working upon crops&#13;
on their own land are more likely to face farm work as a wage alternative,&#13;
this lower wage finding is adopted here. Thus, given the sex, age, schooling&#13;
and village population for each adult, their monthly wage as a farm laborer is&#13;
predicted. 23 Not too many children work for wages even in the rural area. A&#13;
very simple, but somewhat extreme assumption is consequently made - assigning&#13;
a zero wage to all child family labor. Using these predicted wages, value of&#13;
time reported spent on crops by all family members over the year is then&#13;
deducted from crop value together with other purchases. 24&#13;
On the whole, it is not clear whether this estimate of family labor&#13;
cost tends to over or under-estimate true costs. On the one hand, even farm&#13;
laborers' wages may be felt to be too high an opportunity price, partly&#13;
because this wage is estimated only for months in which wage work is done and&#13;
does not allow for periods in which no wage work can be found. On the other&#13;
23 Persons of unknown schooling are assumed to have none. If sex is un-&#13;
known, a weighted average of male and female wages is taken. If no&#13;
age is reported, the person is given a 50-50 chance of being a child&#13;
and the wage computed according to mean adult and child wage.&#13;
24 In fact, RIDS collected hourly activities during the day prior to&#13;
interview on five interview visits for each household (though&#13;
occasionally less), during the 12 months of the survey. Yesterday's&#13;
activities are converted here to hours per month by multiplying by&#13;
30, noting that yesterday could include a week-end, and - adjusting&#13;
for the number of visits in which activities are recorded - then&#13;
transformed to a yearly basis. Monthly wages are converted to an&#13;
hourly equivalent by assuming 24 working days a month (approximately&#13;
the average found) and 8 hours work a day.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 123 -&#13;
side, the assumed zero cost of children's time is obviously an exaggeration,&#13;
and the reduction of farm laborers' monthly wages to an hourly equivalent&#13;
assuming 8 hours of work per day probably understates true hourly pay.&#13;
Moreover, it may well be argued that even if one only works 2 hours in a day&#13;
on own crops, this effectively prevents simultaneous performance of an 8 hour&#13;
wage job, thus again tending to understate the costs. These effects tend to&#13;
balance out and certainly there seems no strong reason for presumption of bias&#13;
in a particular direction.&#13;
The resulting profit figures are presented in Table 4.12.    Average&#13;
profit per crop-producing household is estimated to be 102.10 Pula or 11.42&#13;
Pula per "acre". Comparing the figures in Table 4.9 it is seen that profits&#13;
amount to 76 percent of o01tput value. 25 Equipment depreciation accounts for&#13;
some 17 percent of profits, and profits net of depreciation are 63 percent of&#13;
output. 26&#13;
To some extent profit (or net prof:Lt) per acre might be considered an&#13;
efficiency criterion. Certainly, if differences in profits are a result of&#13;
wiser decisions with regard to the use and timing of inputs in crop production&#13;
this would tend to be true. 27 But profit differences may also arise for&#13;
25 It should be noted that profit here includes implicit rental to land.&#13;
Lacking; data on land prices, (partly because in the traditional&#13;
system sale or rental is not condoned though, as noted earlier,&#13;
apparen,tly, increasingly practiced), no attempt has been made to&#13;
impute a rental price to land.&#13;
26 The depreciation data included in the RIDS file bear little resemblance to&#13;
equipment value even though supposedly computed from reported&#13;
equipment. I have therefore recalculated depreciation here very&#13;
simply as 10 percent of crop equipment value.&#13;
27 An alternative source of profits often studied in this context is&#13;
differences in prices and responses of farmers to these price&#13;
differentials. 'See, for example LEIU and Yotopoulos, "A Test for&#13;
Relative Efficiency and Application to Indian Agriculture," American&#13;
Economic Review, March, 1971. But RIDS rules out the possibility of&#13;
this type of anaLlysis by its adoption of uniform price reporting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124 -&#13;
other reasons such as variations in quality of land, rainfall, or lucky pay-&#13;
off in good years having planted a relatively risky crop. Moreover, profits&#13;
as measured here reflect at best private profitability: by measuring pay-off&#13;
in observed market prices one is ignoring the possibility that such prices may&#13;
not be good indications of true worth to society.&#13;
With this in mind, Table 4.12 compares profits per "acre" for&#13;
different types and locations of household.   Variations in output per "acre"&#13;
in Table 4.9 might be explicable via correlation of equipment, family labor,&#13;
and material inputs with some of the measures in Table 4.9. But it is&#13;
striking how similar are the patterns of net profit per "acre" in Table 4.9&#13;
after subtracting the costs of these additional elements. For example, it&#13;
remains true that net profit per reported "acre" declines quite steadily with&#13;
the size of lands. Only one pattern in Table 4.12 really changed compared to&#13;
Table 4.9 and hence is worthy of separate mention. It was stated that output&#13;
per "acre" is just slightly higher in female-headed households compared to&#13;
male-headed. But, after subtraction of purchased inputs (and particularly the&#13;
greater expenditure on ploughing services) and imputed family labor costs,&#13;
profit per "acre" is higher among male-headed households, as is net profit per&#13;
"acre" despite the larger value of equipment possessed by male-headed&#13;
households.&#13;
B. Profits and Scale of Operation&#13;
In an unpublished note, ("Profitability vs. Income in Rural&#13;
Botswana", July 7, 1978), Derek Hudson offers evidence from RIDS that small&#13;
scale, low income farmers operate their farms far more profitably than do&#13;
their large scale counterparts. If one could presume that such private&#13;
profitability were at all indicative of social profitability, then this&#13;
evidence would tend to argue in favor of encouraging small-scale farming.&#13;

Since Botswana is undergoing establishment of private property rights over&#13;
tribal lands, this is clearly an important issue at the moment.&#13;
This section therefore re-examines Derek Hudson's findings. In&#13;
particular, it appears the earlier study in calculating costs of production&#13;
does not include the cost of family labor time used. Being plausible that&#13;
lower income families achieve greater "profitability" precisely by a more&#13;
intensive use of their owa labors per unit of output, this may be a serious&#13;
omission.  This re-examination consequently adopts the measure of profit&#13;
discussed in the previous sub-section.&#13;
Two approaches are taken to the question of scale. First, it is&#13;
asked whether profit per unit of output rises with the level of output,&#13;
estimating equation (4.3) by "ordinary" least squares.&#13;
PROF = b  + b   Qn (Q) + b2  n (RAIN)             (4.3)&#13;
Q      0    12&#13;
Where:&#13;
PROF      Is Q minus FERT minus PETROL minus OTHER minus cost of ploughing&#13;
services and imputed family labor costs. If estimated profit is&#13;
less than one Pula n(PROF) is set equal to zero.&#13;
Estimates of two variants of (4.3), including and excluding&#13;
Rn (RAIN), are presented in Table 4.13. It is estimated that indeed larger&#13;
output is positively (and "significantly") associated with greater profit per&#13;
unit of output. On average, a one percent increase in output is associated&#13;
with a .4 percent increase in profit per unit of output. As noted above, one&#13;
reason for differences in profitability might be amounts of rainfall. But&#13;

inclusion of the effect of rainfall in the analysis (regression 2 in Table&#13;
4.13) neither shows any effect of rainfall on profitability distinguishable&#13;
from zero, nor reduces the scale effect.&#13;
The second form of analysis considers the factors underlying profit&#13;
receipt. Since the costs of all contributing elements are subtracted from&#13;
output value in our definition of profits, except costs of land and of capital&#13;
equipment, profits may be seen essentially as the rewards to these "fixed"&#13;
factors. The relationship of profits to these two fixed factors is therefore&#13;
examined by estimation of equation (4.4).&#13;
Qn (PROF) = b  + b1 ha (LAND) + b2 tn (K) + b3 Zn (RAIN) + b4 BARO        (4.4)&#13;
"Ordinary" least squares estimates of (4.4) in three variants&#13;
(excluding In (RAIN) and BARO) are presented in Table 4.14.&#13;
The estimated effects (in regression 1, Table 4.14) are such that a&#13;
one percent increase in both land and capital possessed by a household results&#13;
in more than a one percent increase in the level of profits, though&#13;
statistical confidence in this positive scale effect is not strong. 28 Even&#13;
after the effect of rainfall is included in the analysis (regression 3), it&#13;
remains true that a tendency towards a positive scale effect is seen though&#13;
smaller in magnitude.   Without the rain effect given, a one percent increase&#13;
in land and capital is estimated to increase profit by 1.31 percent; holding&#13;
28 Thus, the sum of the exponent coefficients on land and capital sum to more&#13;
than 1. However, the computed Student's t value for the null&#13;
hypothesis that the sum equals 1 is only 1.006 in regression 1 and&#13;
0.353 in regression 3. Obviously, the null hypothesis of no scale&#13;
effect cannot be rejected.&#13;

rain constant in comparing, profits increase by 1.11 percent. In part, this&#13;
scale effect is attributable to higher profits correlated with higher fixed&#13;
inputs in Barolong, though this finding is itself a part of the scale effect&#13;
story. Thus, it is found that after inserting separate control effects for&#13;
both rain and a regional effect for Barolong (regression 2) the elasticity of&#13;
profits with respect to fixed inputs is almost exactly unitary.&#13;
Certainly, none of these results lend support to the hypothesis of&#13;
greater profitability on a smaller scale operation, once family labor costs&#13;
are imputed and deducted from profits, rather the reverse though confidence in&#13;
the latter is not strong.&#13;
4.5 Concluding Remarks&#13;
The results in this paper represent the first economic study of crop&#13;
production in Botswana on a national scale. But certain features of Botswana&#13;
also render this a rare opportunity to examine in some detail crop husbandry&#13;
in a society: (1) Which is extremely sparsely populated and consequently&#13;
resembles a model of an economy with apparently free land; (2) where land is&#13;
traditionally assigned through tribal dispensation and more recently through a&#13;
comparable Land Board mechanism; (3) from which adult men have migrated/ in&#13;
large numbers to the South African mines for a century and to urban Botswana&#13;
since Independence; (4) that generates a high degree of income inequality&#13;
according to Government statistics.&#13;
Given this setting, analysis has focused on the role of crop&#13;
production within this inegalitarian economy and the ability of farming to&#13;
absorb more labor -- particularly adult male labor as demand for workers in&#13;
South Africa declines. Conversely, attention has been directed to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131&#13;
consequences of male withdrawal from rural areas, and especially the common&#13;
outcome of very low income, female-headed households.&#13;
Three quarters of the rural households have land, the average holding&#13;
being about: 8 African acres -- a holding often thought in Botswana to be just&#13;
sufficient for subsistence for an average household. Land is certainly,&#13;
unevenly dispersed -- female-headed, low income, smaller, less wealthy&#13;
households are assigned less land -- though differences are not enormous.&#13;
Perhaps most important we find area of land available is correlated positively&#13;
with number of men present during the ploughing season, though this seems not&#13;
to be the only reason female-headed households have less lands. Moreover,&#13;
section 4.3 est:Lmates quLte a high marginal. product of land for the average&#13;
household and SiLmon Roberts presents evidence of at least occasional settle-&#13;
ment for lands at a price of one beast per field.   Together these suggest land&#13;
-- or more definitely good, cleared land -- is not freely available. Whether&#13;
the infusion of more adult men into the rural areas would result in a greater&#13;
aggregate deployment of lands for crop growing must remain an open but&#13;
important question. From our results we may anticipate that demand for lands&#13;
would increase if more men returned from the mines and towns, so total cropped&#13;
land should increase provided there is some elasticity in the institutionally&#13;
determined supply. But the chief competitor for land is cattle grazing, an&#13;
activity dominated by men powerful in the tribal and political processes.&#13;
Although most households have lands, crop production remains&#13;
comparatively unimportant to the total economy. Our estimate of gross value&#13;
of crop output per crop producing household is 134 Pula (1975) with a net&#13;
profit of 84 Pula in the tribal, non-freehold areas. In part, this is&#13;
explicable by a very low adoption rate of improved cropping practices as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 132 -&#13;
witnessed by the negligible use of fertilizers and chemicals, and total&#13;
absence of irrigation, noted in section 4.2. This despite a very high&#13;
estimated contribution of fertilizers to productivity from the production&#13;
functions in section 4.3. Only hiring of ploughing services is found as a&#13;
common purchase for crop production, and this seems to be necessitated by the&#13;
lack of men.&#13;
The average household has some 176 Pula tied up in crop equipment:&#13;
mostly in the form of single-row ploughs, for modern items such as tractors&#13;
and cultivators remained rare up until 1975. Again male-headed households and&#13;
those with more men are substantially better equipped for crop husbandry, at&#13;
least in part because they are generally wealthier. Our estimate of the&#13;
private internal rate of return on such investments is some 7.5 percent,&#13;
derived from the positive contribution of equipment to production as estimated&#13;
in the production functions.&#13;
The quality of data on household labor inputs and of wage labor hired&#13;
is unfortunately not high. Nonetheless, I believe we can be reasonably&#13;
confident in asserting that women do most of the family crop work and that&#13;
more work time on crops is performed by lower income households' members.&#13;
There are also pieces of evidence to suggest that men and women are&#13;
substitutes rather than complements in cropping, both in the production&#13;
function sense and in the sense of de facto time inputs. Thus, any large&#13;
scale return of miners to crop farming may serve in part to displace&#13;
employment of women.&#13;
The results do not support the suggestion from earlier work on the&#13;
same data within the Government of Botswana that smaller scale operators are&#13;
more profitable. If anything, the results in this paper indicate the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 133 -&#13;
opposite. rhis counter evidence may be of some importance in Botswana, where&#13;
land enclosure is in process, but it must be remembered this refers to&#13;
private, not social profitability.&#13;
The declared development strategy of the Government of Botswana is&#13;
one of using rents from mlining as a source for investment in the agricultural&#13;
sector to generate employment and diffuse the benefits. As of 1975 there is&#13;
not much evidence that this has been successful, at least in crop&#13;
agriculture.   Indeed, the results of this paper are quite pessimistic on the&#13;
potential for promoting employment in crop farming, and indeed we find no&#13;
support for an argument that further investment along existing patterns would&#13;
help. Without a spread of irrigation, without wider use of fertilizers,&#13;
without greater assignment of good lands to crop husbandry, farming is&#13;
unlikely to offer much poltential for employment. Yet subsidies on fertilizer&#13;
are likely to benefit higher income groups more, for we have seen they have a&#13;
greater usage rate, and increased use of modern inputs is subject to high&#13;
degrees of risk and inherent technological difficulties. If employment of men&#13;
in South Africa dleclines, households are likely to be more able and more&#13;
willing to ploughL greater land areas as suggested above. But more could be&#13;
done to encourage such land intake and hence expand employment through price&#13;
support and some form of insurance mechanism, for the high year-to-year&#13;
uncertainty in rainfall acts as a major deterrent.&#13;

Appendix: Regressions on Lands Areas&#13;
Regressions in Table A.1 to A.3 are of the following form:&#13;
A.1 Qn(LAND) = b  + Y b. AD.&#13;
A.2 Qn(LAND) = b  + E b. MEN.&#13;
0 j  J    J&#13;
A.3 Qn(LAND) = b  + E b. CATL.&#13;
0 j  J     J&#13;
Each of these is a piece-wise linear regression, interpolating&#13;
intermediate values to the break-points. The break-points are:&#13;
AD     0,12,24,48,96,192.   (12 is omitted).&#13;
MEN    0,1,2,4,7.          (1 is omitted).&#13;
CATL   0,8,20,80,1000      (0 is omitted).&#13;
The variables in these regressions and equation (1) in the text are&#13;
defined as follows:&#13;
LAND Reported area of land in "acres", rounded to the nearest acre, with 1/2&#13;
being rounded up. Only households reporting land are included, and only&#13;
those with 1/2 "acre" or more.&#13;
AD    Number of adults (age 15+) multiplied by number of months in which&#13;
preaent (i.e., not "elsewhere", "died" or "location unknown") during the&#13;
12 months of the survey. A correction is made for households with less&#13;
than 12 visits. Houses in which an entire shift in inhabitants occurred&#13;
are omitted. Persons of unknown age are included as half-adults.&#13;
MEN   Number of adults known to be male and present between November and&#13;
February.&#13;
FEM   Set equal to one if household head is female, zero otherwise.&#13;
CATL Number of cattle, excluding calves, owned by the household.&#13;
RAIN Average annual rain during five years prior to the survey (in mms.)&#13;
PAM   Measured in the same way as AD, but includes children multiplied by one&#13;
half.&#13;

Chapter 5:  The DistributLon of Wages and Employment in Rural Botswana&#13;
Robert E.B. Lucas&#13;
5.1 Introduction&#13;
Wage earnings play a major role in the generation of household income&#13;
in Botswana. The figures shown in Table 1.]. indicate that, according to the&#13;
Rural Income Distribution Survey (RIDS), 19 percent of rural incomes were&#13;
generated through wages and about 50 percent of rural households reported&#13;
incones from wages in 1974-5.  However, it should be emphasized that RIDS does&#13;
not count absent household members working in town, South Africa, the freehold&#13;
farms or elsewhere as wage workers in the rural household. Nor are the&#13;
earnings of such absentees included in wage income, but their remittances are&#13;
recorded as income of the home group instead. If such absent members are&#13;
counted as part of their rural household group, and indeed many retain fairly&#13;
continuous and active ties, then the role of wage work in Botswana rural homes&#13;
appears substantially greater than RIDS suggests. 1 However, the future&#13;
expansion of urban employment in Botswana remains uncertain. Much is being&#13;
invested in the minerals sector in Botswana, but this is very capital&#13;
intensive, while other investment is largely in infrastructure which directly&#13;
provides only temporary employment during the construction phase. Meanwhile,&#13;
prospects for the manufacturing sector are seriously hampered by a high&#13;
exchange rate maintained by exports of minerals, by a tiny domestic market and&#13;

and Consequences (Gaborone, Botswana: Governnent Printer, 1982).&#13;

an overwhelming international transportation problem for a landlocked&#13;
country. Moreover, future prospects for employment of Botswana nationals in&#13;
South Africa are uncertain at best, and mine recruitment in particular is&#13;
likely to diminish.&#13;
Given this scenario, increasing attention is being directed to&#13;
provision of employment in the rural areas. 2 Indeed, given that the&#13;
proportion of population in the rural areas is over 80 percent, rural&#13;
employment generation may be essential to any meaningful attempt to spread the&#13;
benefits of the rapid growth Botswana has been experiencing.&#13;
Yet, relatively little is known about the actual employment situation&#13;
in rural Botswana. In the present paper, I therefore study the employment&#13;
opportunities open to household members who remain within the rural sector.&#13;
In the context of the household framework of this volume, one consequently&#13;
sees the constraints placed by limited job availability on the household's&#13;
ability to generate income via formal employment in their home area, the&#13;
contribution to household income if jobs are found, and how these&#13;
possibilities may be enhanced by households educating their members.&#13;
More particularly, Sections 5.2 through 5.5 examine respectively:&#13;
the demographic profile of the adult, rural population; the distribution of&#13;
employment among such individuals; occupations of those employed; and the&#13;
structure of wage earnings.&#13;

5.2  The Settiny&#13;
This section of the paper examines the composition of the de facto&#13;
adult population of the rural areas. An adult is defined as anyone age 15&#13;
years and above,. The main purpose is to establish a reference point for&#13;
subsequent sections on employment and wages. In addition, however, some sense&#13;
of the composit:Lon of the potential adult labor force by sex, age, education&#13;
and current location is gained, plus some insights into the educational&#13;
systeL.&#13;
Given the extreate degree of population mobility in Botswana, a de&#13;
facto definition of population is not always simple to conceptualize. RIDS&#13;
includes all persons pres ent at any one of the household's dwellings (in the&#13;
village, at the lands, or at a cattle post) at the first interview. But in&#13;
RIDS, each household is visited monthly for twelve months. Any new persons&#13;
encountered on subsequent visits are added to the household list and anyone&#13;
absent is recorded as such. The definition of "absent" adopted is anyone&#13;
reported "elsewhere", died, or whose location is unknown. In the results&#13;
presented here, each person is counted according to the fraction of the year&#13;
he or she is then actually present.&#13;
Table 5.1 presents estimates of the distribution of rural adults by&#13;
sex, age, education and village category. 3&#13;
3    All cross-tabulations are weighted according to the RIDS stratification&#13;
scheme. Being uncertain as to whether persons of unknown age are&#13;
adults or not, they are omitted from the following tables. As a&#13;
weighted fraction of total adult visits, those of unknown age&#13;
amounted to slightly less than 5 percent. Of the remaining&#13;
observations, those of unknown sex and education are also omitted&#13;
for simplicity, totalling less than one tenth of one percent of&#13;
person-vi sits.&#13;

The first column of the table presents the percentage of each age&#13;
group who are male -- thus, 41.5 percent of adults ages 15-21 are male. Note&#13;
that this fraction is substantially below 50 percent until the oldest age&#13;
category. The explanation presumably derives from a higher out-migration rate&#13;
of men from the rural areas as compared to women, the men returning in old&#13;
age. Since this fraction falls to its lowest level in the age category 31-40&#13;
it would be tempting to suggest more men leave in this age group, but one must&#13;
be careful: Women in the youngest age group have a high rate of migration at&#13;
least into Gaborone, thus tending to raise the rural percentage who are male&#13;
in the youngest categories. Overall, some 41.3 percent of the adult rural&#13;
population de facto is ma:Le.&#13;
The second panel in Table 5.1 presents the educational breakdown.&#13;
"None" refers to zero schooling. "Higher education" includes teacher&#13;
training, agricultural college, nursing and university. Unfortunately, it is&#13;
not clear from the RIDS irLterview form whether education categories refer to&#13;
registration, attendance, or completion of a. particular level of schooling.&#13;
Of the males preEsent in the rural area, some 61 percent report no&#13;
education, as compared to 50 percent for females. Two types of effect may&#13;
combine to generate this sexual disparity: First, of course, fewer males may&#13;
ever attend school perhaps because of the usefulness of boys in cattle tending&#13;
and other activities even at a very young age, yet current school attendance&#13;
data show only slightly less boys than girls in primary school.4 Second,&#13;
however, more men leave the rural area and if those leaving tend to be&#13;
4    In 1975-6 45 percent of primary school attendants were male.   (Republic&#13;
of Botswana, Education Statistics 1975-76, Gaborone, Botswana:&#13;
Governm,ent Printer, undated).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 144 -&#13;
educated, this would raise the percentage left behind with no education. The&#13;
sex imbalance among those with standards 1-4 of education is reversed, so that&#13;
77 percent of both men and women have 4 standards of schooling or less. Less&#13;
than 2 percent of either sex left in the rural area have more than form 3 for&#13;
education. Although the numbers involved are quite small, of adults having&#13;
taken forms 4 or 5 or worked with a brigade, most are male despite the higher&#13;
out-migration of men. On the other hand, the sex split among those with&#13;
higher education is essentially even.&#13;
The third panel in Table 5.1 shows a breakdown by village category.&#13;
The first four categories are defined by village population. 5 The Barolong&#13;
farm region is treated separately as settlement patterns are somewhat&#13;
different. No particular pattern in sex balance appears across the village&#13;
categories -- apparently the rate of out migration of men compared to women is&#13;
no different in smaller villages than in larger ones. However, one pattern&#13;
across village categories which does emerge from more detailed breakdown of&#13;
the data (not replicated here) is that education levels for those located in&#13;
the smaller villages are clearly lower than in larger villages. This, of&#13;
course, may reflect some combination of differential school attendance among&#13;
original inhabitants and of selective out-migration.&#13;
5.3 The Distribution of Employment&#13;
Given the de facto composition of the adult population across&#13;
location types, the next question posed in this section is the extent of&#13;
involvement in wage labor for the various population categories.&#13;
5    Data on village populations are from:   Republic of Botswana, A Guide to&#13;
Villages (Gaborone, Botswana: Government Printer, 1973).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Frequently, a person in the rural area who works for wages one month&#13;
may not work the next then again may return to wage work. To say a person is&#13;
or is not working for wages is then clearly misleading. But not only do&#13;
individuals vary with regard to months and days worked, but also the number of&#13;
hours worked in a day differ. Fortunately, RIDS asked hourly activities on&#13;
the day prior to interview in five out of the twelve visits. Since the five&#13;
visits were fairly evenly spread over the year, and the days of interview&#13;
within the month quite random, yesterday's activities may be taken as&#13;
representative on the whole. Excluding observations when the day of interview&#13;
is Sunday or Monday, in order to omit the weekend, I therefore calculated for&#13;
various (weight,ed) population groups the percentage of hours worked for wages&#13;
relative to total hours of activity recorded. Since interviewers were asked&#13;
to base activitLes on a 12 hour day, and weekends are excluded, available&#13;
hours amount to 60. A person working a 40 hour week for wages would then show&#13;
66.7 percent. The results are displayed in Table 5.2.&#13;
Obviously, the overall figures are low in an absolute sense: 6.6&#13;
percent for males and 1.8 percent for females. On the whole, it is clear that&#13;
wage labor is none too prevalent in the rural areas. A word of reservation,&#13;
however: it is likely that reported hours of work for wages omit many types&#13;
of work done for others in exchange for some form of payment. For example,&#13;
the practice of giving pElrties with food and drink in exchange for past or&#13;
future labor comlmitment is apparently quite common -- but such work will not&#13;
show up as wage labor. tionetheless the overall figures show that time spent&#13;
in more formal wage work is very small both for male and female adults.&#13;
Looking; at the age dispersion, it is seen that in all age categories,&#13;
males spend a higher fraction of their time in wage labor. In fact, this&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 147 -&#13;
difference is Eso substatitial that although females out-number males in the&#13;
younger age groups, the percentage of total wage-labor time coming from males&#13;
is 60 percent or higher in all age categories. Males and females display a&#13;
similar age dispersion of time spent in wage labor: for both sexes this peaks&#13;
in the age 22-30 category and falls steadily thereafter. Even for the peak&#13;
age category, however, this amounts only to 11 percent of time for males and 3&#13;
percent for women.&#13;
From the education panel in Table 5.2 it is seen that the fraction of&#13;
time spent in wage labor rises steadily with the level of education for both&#13;
sexes (with the exception of females reporting forms 4 and 5 where very few&#13;
observations are found). It remains true that within every education&#13;
category, the proportion of time spent by each female on wage labor is less&#13;
than that of each male. Thus, males with higher education report 1/3 of their&#13;
time spent on wage earning, whereas women with higher education report only 14&#13;
percent. Remembering that half of all adult females have no education, it is&#13;
noteworthy that this group reports less than one percent of their time spent&#13;
in wage earnings. On the! whole, one might have expected brigade training to&#13;
prepare people for wage work, yet the fraction of time spent in wage labor by&#13;
those with brigade training is low -- lower even than those with standards 5-7&#13;
of schooling.&#13;
Finally, it is clear from the village category panel that the larger&#13;
villages witness a greater proportion of time spent in wage labor by both&#13;
sexes, compared to the smaller villages. 6&#13;
6    One reason for the comparatively low rate of wage work in Barolong,&#13;
despite the more intensive agriculture noted in Chapter 4, is that&#13;
share-cropping Ls quite common.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148 -&#13;
5.4 Occupations&#13;
In RIDS, a given person is often found to be performing different&#13;
occupations on subsequent visits. Though no doubt some of this switching is&#13;
attributable to the difficulties of working with a very detailed occupational&#13;
classification, some is almost certainly due to real job changes. In counting&#13;
the occupational distribution in the rural areas, I have therefore counted&#13;
each visit separately in computing weighted proportion. The results are&#13;
presented in Table 5.3 for major occupational groups. It must be emphasized&#13;
that this distribution applies only to wage earners, so that for example the&#13;
common practice of beer brewing for sale among women does not appear under&#13;
food processing.&#13;
The first vertical panel of Table 5.3 presents the sex breakdown of&#13;
occupations. A number of the occupations are almost exclusively male&#13;
(professionals, typists and clerks, miners, production workers, transport&#13;
workers, laborers, etc.). Only a handful of occupations are predominantly&#13;
female (nurses, domestic servants, and to a lesser extent teachers). The&#13;
spread of occupations within the sexes is quite wide. The largest occupations&#13;
for men are laborer (28 percent of men) and agriculture (16 percent). For&#13;
women, they are domestic servant (28 percent), teacher (20 percent), and farm&#13;
worker (15 percent). It is particularly interesting to note that although&#13;
this is a rural area, the range of wage activities is very wide, and that farm&#13;
work for wages is equally important among men and women but amounts to only 15&#13;
percent of wage workers within each sex.&#13;
Across the different sizes of village, the variety of wage&#13;
occupations performed expands as size increases. Thus, the largest three&#13;
occupations in the smallest village (farm workers, food processors&#13;

and laborers) account for 66 percent of all wage labor. In the largest&#13;
villages the three most common occupations (servants, teachers and laborers)&#13;
cover 38 percent of all wage labor. Not only does the variety change but also&#13;
the relative importance of occupations. The incidence of farm workers working&#13;
for wages declines steadily from the smallest (25 percent) to the largest (7&#13;
percent) villages. On the other hand, the role of household servants expands,&#13;
from 6 percent to a surprising 17 percent in the largest villages. Note also&#13;
that apart from food processors in the smallest villages, there is a marked&#13;
absence of "production" workers reflecting the general lack of rural industry.&#13;
5.5 The Distribution of Wage Earnings&#13;
Section 5.3 has shown there exists substantial variability among wage&#13;
earners, with regard to age, education, sex, location and their&#13;
interactions. Section 5.4 has shown also quite different distributions of&#13;
occupations among wage-earners, at least according to sex and location. Given&#13;
this degree of variability among wage-earners, one would also expect&#13;
substantial differences in wages earned by particular types of individuals,&#13;
and it is to this variability which the present section turns.&#13;
RIDS reports the amount of wages received in money and in kind for&#13;
every individual who earned wages in the month prior to each visit. Fringe&#13;
benefits were imputed in the office following survey completion and added into&#13;
reported wage on the RIDS data file. Goods received as in-kind wages were&#13;
valued at rural market prices and added to money wages to provide a total&#13;
referred to here as monthly wage. The average value of this monthly wage is&#13;
estimated to be 49 Pula for males and 28 Pula for females. The average number&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 151 -&#13;
of days worked among wage workers hardly differs for men and women, 7&#13;
estimated to be 24 and 2:3 respectively, with a result that average daily wage&#13;
is also substantially different for male and female wage workers -     some 2.03&#13;
and 1.24 Pula. 8l Women also receive a somewhat higher fraction of their wages&#13;
in kind -- 13 percent as opposed to 7 percent for men.&#13;
To examine the general form of the relationship between schooling,&#13;
age and wages for males znd females, the following piece-wise linear wage&#13;
equation is estimated for males and females separately:&#13;
WGE   -   b0 +  E bi    SCHLi+   E b a  AGEi                    (5.1)&#13;
0   iii&#13;
where the variables are defined by:&#13;
WGE =     Monthly wage:  total wages (in cash and kind) reported over the 12&#13;
visits, divided by the number of visits in which wage work is&#13;
reported for the indivi.dual;&#13;
SCHL =    Number of years of schooling compiled as follows:&#13;
7    Interviewers often recorded full-time work as 30 or 31 days, which is&#13;
probably an exaggeration.&#13;
8    Daily wage is computed here by adding monthly wages across all visits in&#13;
which work is recorded, then dividing by the sum of all days worked&#13;
for wages (each appropriately weighted). This, of course, is not&#13;
identic.al to the weighted average of daily wage per person-visit.&#13;
The latter can, however, be misleading. For example, in some months&#13;
a person might receive a calf in payment of wages for work performed&#13;
in the last year, yet in the month in question may only work one&#13;
day. Daily wage for this month alone would consequently be&#13;
exorbitant.&#13;

omitted to allow inclusion of constant terms. All regressions in this chapter&#13;
are estimated by "ordinary" least squares. 9 Standard errors of estimated&#13;
coefficients are displayed in parentheses immediately below the relevant&#13;
coefficient in the following tables, and each observation is one adult (age&#13;
154+). The estimates are presented in Table 5.4, but interpretation of these&#13;
is perhaps more readily seen from Figures 5.1 and 5.2.&#13;
Figure 5.1 shows the estimated effect of years of schooling on&#13;
monthly wage after taking out the effect of age. Thus, the graphs in Figure&#13;
5.1 are for men and women at age 30. First, it is clear that, given age, at&#13;
every level of schooling females earn less than males. Table 5.1 stated that&#13;
61 percent of male and 50 percent of female rural adults never went to&#13;
school. Yet, despite these substantial proportions with no education, the&#13;
The estimates presented here were actually obtained several years ago, at&#13;
a time before correction for sample selection became common&#13;
practice. It would clearly be of interest in further work to pursue&#13;
such correction.&#13;

school/wage profiles show no significant increase in wages from mere entry&#13;
into school at standard 1, either for males or for females. Apparently,&#13;
school entry is not a screening device either associated with ability or with&#13;
social factors leading to higher wages.&#13;
Indeed, females display no increase in wages through the first four&#13;
standards of school (some 78 percent of rural female adults). Males, on the&#13;
other hand already show a gain in monthly wage by standard 4. From standard 4&#13;
on, both sexes gain roughly in parallel but with females at a lower level. No&#13;
sharp discontinuities in the profile are observed associated with any&#13;
certification point.&#13;
The age/wage profile is drawn in Figure 5.2 holding school&#13;
achievement constant at standard 4. Thus, the fact that younger persons have&#13;
more schooling is essentially netted out of this profile. Again, females&#13;
exhibit a lower lprofile at every age. Neither profile is continuously rising,&#13;
but peaks and then indicates declining wages at greater ages. However,&#13;
women's wages area found to peak much earlier than those of men. Whereas&#13;
males' wages conitinue rising after age 30 through age 50, those of women do&#13;
not. The failure of women's wages to rise with age is not uncommon in other&#13;
countries, and is sometimes attributed to females dropping out of the labor&#13;
force during early child-rearing and hence failing to acquire experience. But&#13;
the RIDS data show time in wage work for rural females is at its highest&#13;
between 22 and 30) years of age, which is the greatest period of childbirth and&#13;
caring for young children.&#13;
Figures 5.1 and 5.2 indicate a fairly steadily growing wage rate with&#13;
rise in years of schooling and an age-wage profile at first rising then&#13;
falling, but at different levels for males and females. The average monthly&#13;

wage of men employed in the smaller villages is estimated to be some 37 Pula&#13;
as compared to 57 Pula In the largest villages. Moreover, it seems plausible&#13;
that even within the rural sector the labor market may be segmented between&#13;
more formal jobs and agricultural work (remembering that freehold farms are&#13;
not included in our sample). In order to explore and capture some of the&#13;
inter-relationships among these various factors influencing wages, the&#13;
following equation is estimated for several subsamples of workers:&#13;
n (WGE) = b   + b   SCHL + b  EXP + b  EXP  + b   FARM             (5.2)&#13;
n(GE        0+b1SI~         2        3         4&#13;
where additional variables are defined by:&#13;
EXP = AGE - SCRL - 5. (An estimate of the number of years since leaving&#13;
school.)&#13;
FARM = A variable indicating fraction of days worked for wages over the year&#13;
occurring In months when the individual reported working as a farm&#13;
laborer for wages.&#13;
Equation (5.2) is actually estimated in eight variants: for males and&#13;
females; in smaller and larger (population 5000+) villages; and for monthly&#13;
and daily measures of WGE.    Daily wage is measured by total wages reported&#13;
over the twelve visits, divided by total days reported worked for wages over&#13;
the twelve visits.&#13;
Although these equations are of a fairly conventional type, some&#13;
considerable care must be taken in their interpretation. In particular, the&#13;
sample over which these equations are estimated is confined to the rural&#13;
sector. It is well-knowni that persons educated in the rural areas are thereby&#13;
often enabled or enticed into migrating to town where wages for the educated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 158 -&#13;
are comparatively high.   Since such migrants are omitted from our&#13;
rural sample, equation (5.2) does not reflect the full effect on wage&#13;
opportunities of schooling or even experience. In this sense, "rate of&#13;
return" is a misnoma for this type of context though unfortunately&#13;
conventionally applied. Nor can we say whether an estimate of bi will over&#13;
or under state the overall effect of education on wages for rural&#13;
inhabitants. Certainly the better educated migrate to town and receive higher&#13;
wages, tending to produce an under- estimate. But, for example, large numbers&#13;
of uneducated men migrate to the South African mines where wages have risen&#13;
sharply in recent years.&#13;
Nonetheless, estimates of equations such as (5.2) are useful devices&#13;
for examining the de facto structure of wages within the rural sector. These&#13;
estimates are presented in Table 5.5.&#13;
Each year of schooling is estimated on average to raise monthly wage&#13;
of males in the larger villages by 18 percent and that of females by about 20&#13;
percent.  These figures are of a comparable order of magnitude to those found&#13;
in other developing countries, but it is unusual to find the rate of return to&#13;
schooling no lower for females than males. Within the smaller villages, the&#13;
reverse pattern is, however, observed: the rise in monthly wage is 20 percent&#13;
for men per year of schooling but only 15 percent for women.&#13;
The estimated effect of schooling on monthly earnings combines, of&#13;
course, two effects: a higher daily wage rate plus possibly a greater number&#13;
of days worked for wages per month among those with more education. Table 5.5&#13;
therefore repeats the same analysis employing daily wage rather than&#13;
monthly. It is then found that men and women have almost identical percentage&#13;
increases in daily wage per year of school at about 14 percent in larger&#13;
&#13;

villages and 17 percent in smaller ones. That the daily effect is lower for&#13;
both sexes confirms that part of the benefit of schooling comes in increased&#13;
days of wage-work.&#13;
Thus, at higher levels of schooling, workers in smaller villages tend&#13;
to catch up with their bigger village counterparts. A number of reasons for&#13;
this might be suggested: (i) lack of wealth and facilities in the smaller&#13;
villages tends to prevent families from educating their children to take&#13;
advantage of the large pay gap; (ii) since the educated tend to be more&#13;
mobile, it may be necessary to pay relatively large amounts to persuade them&#13;
to continue working in the smaller villages; (iii) government pay scales tend&#13;
to integrate the markets for educated labor, leaning towards similar pay&#13;
irrespective of location.&#13;
The constant terms in equation (5.2) provide estimates of the average&#13;
log wage for persons with no schooling, who have not yet benefitted from post-&#13;
school maturity and are not fanm laborers. Not surprisingly, this "base" wage&#13;
is higher in the larger villages than the smaller -- about 21 percent higher&#13;
daily wage for males for example.&#13;
But it is particularly interesting to note that both in terms of&#13;
monthly wage and daily wage, females are found to have very similar or even&#13;
slightly higher "base" wages than males. Given this finding, together with&#13;
our estimate of approximately equal returns to schooling for the sexes, why do&#13;
we also observe lower average wages for women than men?&#13;
The answer resides in the differential effects of age between men and&#13;
women. For each year after school, the wages of men -- whether monthly or&#13;
daily, in larger or smaller villages -- rise by about 8 to 9 percent. But for&#13;
women, this rise ranges only from 4 percent in monthly wage in smaller&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 161 -&#13;
villages to something indistinguishable from zero in daily wage in larger&#13;
villages. Not only do women's wages rise less with age, however, but the&#13;
average age of women working for wages is some 5 years less than that of&#13;
males. Together, these effects add more than four times as much to daily&#13;
wages of males as for females at their average levels of experience. 10    And&#13;
even if women remained in the wage labor iforce to gain the same average&#13;
experience as males, this gap would hardly close at all.&#13;
Finally, in almiost every case, work as a farm laborer is estimated to&#13;
pay persons of given sex, schooling, maturity and in similar village size&#13;
categorles a much lower wage. For males, this amounts to 61 percent lower&#13;
monthly wages in smaller villages and 45 percent lower in larger villages.&#13;
For women these differences are 48 percent and 42 percent. These latter&#13;
measures suggest a highly dichotomous rural labor market, even among those who&#13;
do work for wages. Those working in the privileged sectors - government,&#13;
parastatals,1' and rural industry - are earning much higher wages than&#13;
similar persons performing farm labor. Note, however, that at least in the&#13;
case of women this is almost entirely because non-farm laborers are working&#13;
more days rather than receiving higher daily wages, for the FARM variable in&#13;
the daily wage equation for women shows no real difference from a zero&#13;
effect. For men, on the other hand, the dlchotomy persists even in the daily&#13;
wage.  It seems that even in the villages the organized wage labor market may&#13;
be paying men (of given age and education) significantly above their&#13;
opportunity cost.&#13;

Chapter 6: Socio-Economic and Demographic Aspects of&#13;
School Enrollment and Attendance in Rural Botswana&#13;
Dov Chernichovsky&#13;
6.1 Introduction&#13;
As has been true for other African and non-African mineral-rich&#13;
economies, the most serious constraint on Botswana's development to date has&#13;
been the lack of human capital.&#13;
Schaperal notes that in traditional Botswana schooling was conceived&#13;
as a burden on the family, because of both the new expenditures associated&#13;
with schooling and the loss of the child's contribution to household&#13;
production and iLncome. Ashton2 notes that parents in Botswana apparently&#13;
failed to perceive the benefits of education.&#13;
The situation has changed fundamentally since the writings of&#13;
Schapera and Ashiton in the forties. Largely through Govebrnment policy&#13;
programs of school construction and teacher training, sclhools are relatively&#13;
widespread.  The benefits of schooling are apparent in the labor market, as&#13;
shown by Lucas in Chapter 5, and are even more immediate at home - schools&#13;
often provide free meals and health care to their pupils.&#13;
The schooling system may not be designed, however, to completely&#13;
cover sparsely pzopulated areas. This reflects, in part, the movement and&#13;
social spread of Botswana' s rural population across villages, lands, and&#13;

cattle posts. Moreover, as was shown in related studies, children, especially&#13;
in households with assets, play a role in the household economy, as noted in&#13;
Chapter 3. As a consequence, the indirect costs of schooling--those noted by&#13;
Schapera--may still be substantial in Botswana today. These costs, in&#13;
addition to the direct costs of transportation and uniforms, may be&#13;
prohibitive to the schooling of many children. The evidence we present later&#13;
shows that even primary schooling was not universal in Botswana at the time of&#13;
the 1974 Rural Income Distribution Survey (RIDS).&#13;
The objective of this paper is to study the demographic and socio-&#13;
economic correlates of school enrollment and attendance in Botswana, with&#13;
particular attention to how schooling is affected by household wealth and a&#13;
child's economic role in the household. The Chapter is divided into three&#13;
further sections. First, the setting and the data are described, highlighting&#13;
the benefits and costs of schooling in Botswana, and noting some of the basic&#13;
features of school attendance. Second, the conceptual framework in which the&#13;
data are analyzed is presented. Finally, the correlates of school enrollment&#13;
and attendance are discussed on the basis of tabulations of the data and a&#13;
multivariate regression analysis.&#13;
6.2 Setting and Data&#13;
Mueller and Lucas, in dealing with wage employment and incomes in&#13;
rural Botswana, demonstrate, in Chapters 3, 4, and 5, that education&#13;
contributed substantially to both wage and non-wage incomes. Both men and&#13;
women experience an increase in monthly wages for each additional year of&#13;
schooling, partly because better educated persons spend more time at work.&#13;
Significantly, however, compared with men of similar age and education, women&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 165 -&#13;
both work and earn less. It is evident, for example, that just one year of&#13;
schooling affects males' wages; it takes four years of schooling to affect&#13;
females' wages.&#13;
Mueller's analysis of time use and total household income shows in&#13;
Chapter 3 that the impact of education on household income is particularly&#13;
strong in households which do not own cattle--a prime social and economic&#13;
asset in Botswana. Moreover, besides being a major vehicle for economic&#13;
mobility, the benefits of schooling include the care of children during school&#13;
time, and often free meals and medical care, which are significant&#13;
contributions to household welfare.&#13;
Of the 6,475 persons for whom data were available through the RIDS&#13;
survey, 2,253 were children in the 6-18 year age group. The discussion here&#13;
is confined to this age group, which includes both primary and secondary&#13;
school children. For each individual two types of data were available: the&#13;
level of education obtained, measured by years of schooling, and the&#13;
regularity of attendance, measured by hours spent at school during the five&#13;
days of the survey when time allocation was recorded.&#13;
Table 6.1 presents the distribution of children enrolled in school by&#13;
age and sex. It is evident that only one half of the children aged 7-18&#13;
attend school.     Even in the 10-14 age group, which is the prime period for&#13;
schooling, only about 59 percent of the children are enrolled. Consistently,&#13;
across all age groups, a higher percentage of girls than boys attends&#13;
3   A child was considered "enrolled" if he or she reported spending time&#13;
in school during a!t least one interview. Sampling weights are&#13;
applied toall tabLes. The age group of 6 years old was omitted here&#13;
due to thelate entry to school common in Botswana.&#13;

school. 4&#13;
Table 6.2 presents the distribution of activities by boys and girls&#13;
according to their age and schooling status. 5 The comparison between those&#13;
in school and those out of school is meant to highlight the activities that&#13;
presumably "compete" with schooling for children's time. The data imply that&#13;
across all age groups, schooling time is at the "expense" of all other&#13;
activities. By gender, boys give up more time of income earning activities&#13;
for schooling than girls. Girls, on the other hand, give up relatively more&#13;
time for housekeeping and leisure activities than boys. Across all age&#13;
groups, girls spend a higher proportion of their time in school than their&#13;
male counterparts. Leisure time appears to be "sacrificed", particularly in&#13;
the age group 10-14, by both boys and girls.&#13;
Seasonality may put different demands on children's labor, and&#13;
therefore on their schooling. Table 6.3 presents the distribution of boys'&#13;
and girls' activities by month of interview. Both July and November are&#13;
months with no school vacations and are therefore suitable for illustrating&#13;
the differences in demand for child labor by season. In November, when very&#13;
little agricultural activity takes place and almost everybody is back in his&#13;
4   It is possible that the average school enrollment of boys may actually be&#13;
biased upwards. The number of males in the age group 15-18 is&#13;
substantially smaller than the number of females. This is probably&#13;
due to labor migration from rural areas to towns.&#13;
5 These data are discussed extensively by Mueller. Income earning&#13;
activities are "work" in the national accounts sense, including crop&#13;
and animal husbandry, employment, trading, venturing, hunting, and&#13;
food gathering. Leisure is an actual statement of rest, play, etc.,&#13;
and is not "residual" time.&#13;

village, time spent in school is at a peak. In July, however, when the&#13;
harvest is aboul: to end, both boys and girls spend less time in school than&#13;
they do in November. In May, with the beginning of the harvest, a prime&#13;
agricultural activity of females, less schooling time is reported by girls&#13;
than by boys. iathough 1:his difference is not great, it should be noted that&#13;
May is the only month for which girls report less time in school than boys.&#13;
All in all, it appears that during the relatively busier months, children&#13;
intensify their participation in various economic activities, and they do so&#13;
at the expense of schooling and leisure.&#13;
6.3   Conceptual and Analytical Framework&#13;
The economic analysis of children's schooling is often interwoven&#13;
with analyses of the determinants of fertility behavior. 6    The prime concern&#13;
of these analyses has been the parents' decision regarding the number of&#13;
children they have (quantity) and child quality, often measured by the level&#13;
of a child's education. This general notion of "quantity-quality" trade-off,&#13;
formalized by Theil, 7 does not permit an explicit account of the costs of&#13;
schooling that are important in an environment where child labor is common.&#13;
This is due to the fact that the formulation considers the price of a combined&#13;

factor which is determined by both quality and quantity.&#13;
Formulations that come closer to accounting for costs of education&#13;
per se are those dealing with investments in schooling. 8 Although not&#13;
pertaining specifically to the education of children, these models, Mincer's&#13;
in particular, are useful here because they emphasize foregone earnings as a&#13;
major component in the costs of education. We use the same approach by&#13;
incorporating children's time--which can be used in household and on-farm&#13;
production--as an input in children's education, particularly among households&#13;
which own productive assets.&#13;
The basic feature in all economic formulations is that children's&#13;
schooling incurs costs--direct or indirect--and thus competes with other&#13;
commodities des:lred by the household for the family's scarce resources. The&#13;
major hypotheses; derived from these formulations are as follows: (i)&#13;
schooling is positively associated with the level of the household wealth,&#13;
i.e., wealthier families can afford more schooling and probably have a higher&#13;
rate of return on formal education; (ii) parents may choose to substitute the&#13;
number of offspring for dhe average level of their children's education: 9 and&#13;
(iii) household characteristics and other Eactors that increase the cost of&#13;
education will lower the propensity to educate children.&#13;

Bureau of Economic Research, 1974), and Gary S. Becker, Human&#13;
Capital and Personal Distribution of Income: An Analytical&#13;
Approach (W. S. Woytinsky Lecture No. 1, University of Michigan,&#13;
Department of Economics, 1976).&#13;
This, however, may not be the case under a regime of high child&#13;
mortality. See D. Chernichovsky, "The Interrelationship between&#13;
Investment in Children's Health and Education: Theoretical and&#13;
Empirical Notes," Working Paper No. 3 (Ben-Gurion Univ., Health and&#13;
Welfare Econonmics, 1982).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The discussion here is confined to these main hypotheses, with&#13;
particular emphasis on (iii), as it is largely based on identifying how&#13;
various household characteristics affect the demand on children's time, which&#13;
is regarded as a major component of the cost of schooling.&#13;
A few measures for formal education are used. The first--whether or&#13;
not a child is enrolled in school--is intended to measure how household&#13;
characteristics affect school enrollment for all children. The second measure&#13;
is the level of education (including zero) completed by those children at the&#13;
time of the survey. This measure is observed for those not currently&#13;
enrolled, and for whom this represents completed schooling. For those&#13;
enrolled, we observe a third measure--the hours per day spent in school.&#13;
6.4 Correlates of School Enrollment and Attendance&#13;
The correlates of schooling in rural Botswana are presented in Tables&#13;
6.4, 6.5, and 6.6. 10 The first two tables imply simple correlations between&#13;
schooling and demographic and socio-economic variables. Table 6.6 shows&#13;
regression coefficients estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) with various&#13;
schooling measures as dependent variables. 11 Column 1 in this table shows&#13;
10    The analysis rests on the assumption that the age and sex distribution&#13;
of children vis-a-vis the explanatory variables, such as income, is&#13;
entirely random. This may not be entirely correct with regard to&#13;
the age distribution because of cohort effects and because the same&#13;
factors that influence schooling may also affect the number of&#13;
children in the family. For example, a baby in the household is&#13;
associated with a younger family which probably has fewer and&#13;
younger children. Higher incomes may be associated with more and&#13;
older children, ceteris paribus, as wealth and family size are&#13;
positively correlated in rural Botswana. See Dov Chernichovsky,&#13;

the additional probabilLty that a child is enrolled in school, given a unit&#13;
increase in the independent variable (x). The second and third columns&#13;
indicate the additional level of education attained for each unit increase in&#13;
that variable. The last: column shows the effect of the independent variables&#13;
on the amount of time spent in school (measured in hours per day).&#13;
Before discussLng the demographic and socio-economic variables, a few&#13;
control variables are introduced:   type of community, age, and gender.   Type&#13;
of community and village size are indicative of the availability of schools,&#13;
their quality, and to art extent, the opportunities for child labor. 12&#13;
Indeed, the data suggest that children in larger villages and of the freehold&#13;
and Baralong farms are more likely to be enrolled in school than children in&#13;
rural areas. 13 On a simple correlation basis, children in large villages,&#13;
both those in school and those out of school, have higher average levels of&#13;
education than other children. However, when controlling for other variables,&#13;
as shown in Table 6.6, this particular difference between big villages and&#13;
other locations vanishes. Hence, big villages affect primarily children's&#13;
enrollment probabilities, while other factors affect levels of education and&#13;
time in school. This is consistent with the evidence that most of the&#13;
children not enrolled (64 per cent) have never attended school. The&#13;
12   There have been substantial differences, both quantitative and&#13;
qualitative, between schools in small and large locations. See Neil M.&#13;
Campbell and John G. Abbot, Botswana's Primary School System: A Spatial&#13;
Analysis (Gaborone: Institute of Development Management, 1976).&#13;

statistical insignificance of the relevant coefficient in Table 6.6 indicates&#13;
that the level or education of enrolled children is unrelated to type of&#13;
community.&#13;
It is Lnteresting to note that, when controlling for other factors in&#13;
the freehold and Barolong farms, enrolled children spend fewer hours per day&#13;
in school than do those Erom other communities.    Since children on these farms&#13;
have a higher propensity to be enrolled than in other rural areas, this may&#13;
suggest some tradeoff bet:ween the number of children sent to school and the&#13;
time each child spends there; i.e., some parents may be inclined to send fewer&#13;
of their children to school but on a more regular basis.&#13;
The probability of being enrolled in school has a curvilinear pattern&#13;
with respect to age, as shown in Table 6.6; compared with their younger&#13;
siblings, older children show a declining propensity to be enrolled in&#13;
school. This is consistent with late entry to school, and a growing tendency&#13;
with age to quit school. It appears that the longer a child remains in&#13;
school, the more regularly he attends it.&#13;
As already shown, compared with boys, girls are more likely to be&#13;
enrolled in school and stay their longer. Parents are thus more inclined to&#13;
educate their daughters. Even when parents decide to stop their children's&#13;
schooling, they will do so with their sons first. Furthermore, enrolled girls&#13;
seem to be achieving higher levels of schooling than their male&#13;
counterparts. Once we control for other variables, however, enrolled girls do&#13;
not appear to be spending more hours per day in school than enrolled boys.&#13;
Household demographic characteristics considered are: gender of the&#13;
head of household, presence of a baby, number of school-aged children, and&#13;
number of elderly people (ages 60 and over) in the household.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 178 -&#13;
The figures in Table 6.4 indicate that, compared with males, females&#13;
who head hosueholds have a slightly higher propensity to send their children&#13;
to school and to keep them there. These findings may reflect the reality that&#13;
females are generally more educated than males in rural Botswana, are likely&#13;
to have fewer assets requiring child labor, and may have less time available&#13;
for children around the house. Indeed, when other variables, including the&#13;
education of household heads, are controlled for, as shown in Table 6.6, the&#13;
gender of the head of household has no effect, in a statistical sense, on&#13;
schooling. That is, the other factors correlated with sex of head of&#13;
household may be more influential on children's schooling.&#13;
The presence of a baby in the household, a transitory phenomenon&#13;
which places additional demands on children's time -- girls in particular --&#13;
seems to have the expected negative effect on other children's schooling time.&#13;
One of the most interesting findings is that, contrary to the&#13;
"Western" notion of "quantity-quality" tradeoff, the number of children aged&#13;
7-14 in a household, who put the highest demand on resources for schooling,&#13;
appears to have a positive effect on schooling. The larger the number of&#13;
school-age children in the household, the greater the probability of their&#13;
school enrollment and the higher their levels of education. This finding can&#13;
in part be explained by the diminishing returns to labor in a household with&#13;
any given amount of assets, that reduce the indirect costs of schooling.&#13;
These decreasing returns may lead to role assignment in the household, with&#13;
some children being kept for household and farm activities, while others are&#13;
"assigned" to school and allowed to concentrate on this activity.&#13;
The hypothesis that a greater availability of labor "frees" children&#13;
for school is strongly supported by the positive association between schooling&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 179 -&#13;
of children and the presence in the household of elderly people, who might&#13;
have been expected to exert a negative infLuence due to traditional attitudes&#13;
towards formal schooling.   While no variatlon is explained in Table 6.4 by the&#13;
presence of elderly peop]Le, the regression coefficients in Table 6.6 indicate&#13;
that the higher the number of elderly persons in the household, the higher the&#13;
average level of education and the more time spent in school. Again, all&#13;
other things equal, it appears that when more persons are available in the&#13;
household, the demand for child labor is lowered, thereby lowering the&#13;
indirect costs of formal education.&#13;
The impact of socio-economic factors on children's schooling is&#13;
presented in Table 6.5 and the remaining section of Table 6.6. These&#13;
variables include levels of education of the head of the household and&#13;
holdings of cattle, small stock, and land. The association between these&#13;
variables as a group and children's schooling is summarized in Table 6.5 by&#13;
the relationship between iLncome deciles and schooling. In this context, the&#13;
reader should keep in mind Mueller's findings in Chapter 3 showing the&#13;
positive and significant impact of non-human capital on children's&#13;
productivity.&#13;
The variable with the most significant impact on child schooling is&#13;
the education of the person leading the household: the more educated the head&#13;
of the household, the higher the likelihood of school enrollment of his or her&#13;
children, the lonler their stay in school before dropping out, and the higher&#13;
the level of schooling of children still enrolled. At the same time, children&#13;
of more educated household heads appear to spend less time per day in school&#13;
than other children.   This particular finding may suggest that, all other&#13;
things equal, rather than dlscriminating among children, educated parents may&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 180 -&#13;
send more children to school but allow each child to spend fewer hours there&#13;
on the average.&#13;
The remaining variables pertain to holdings of physical assets--a&#13;
prime source and measure of household productivity and wealth in rural&#13;
Botswana, as financial assets are relatively non-existent. These physical&#13;
assets bring about opposing price and income effects; while wealthier families&#13;
can afford more schooling, they are likely to incur higher indirect costs for&#13;
child education because they may have a higher demand for child labor.&#13;
The results in Tables 6.5 and 6.6 show that ownership of cattle has&#13;
no significant impact on the probability of school enrollment. However, there&#13;
is a definite increase in the amount of time per day spent in school by the&#13;
children of households wealthy in cattle. There is a negative effect on all&#13;
measures of schooling, including time per day spent in school, when the&#13;
household is relatively well endowed with land holdings and small stock, which&#13;
is usually the economic responsibility of children. As land cultivation and&#13;
raising small stock are sources of living for the relatively poor, these&#13;
combined results suggest that among small holders, those who own primarily&#13;
small stock and land, the price effect associated with a higher demand for&#13;
child labor dominates. That is, fewer children in these households are sent&#13;
to school and on a less regular basis. Wealthier households, those relatively&#13;
well-endowed in cattle, can hire labor and appear to "specialize"; they send&#13;
as many children to school as do households with fewer cattle, but they keep&#13;
the children in school on a more regular basis. This general notion is&#13;
supported by the figures in Table 6.5 indicating a curvilinear (U-shape)&#13;
pattern of schooling with respect to income deciles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 181 -&#13;
The findings that relate to the measured effects on schooling of&#13;
human and non-human capital confirm our basic hypotheses. The level of&#13;
education of the head of household has the "purest" (positive) wealth effect&#13;
because it does not enhance in any direct way a child's productivity. Of&#13;
course, we must take into account the effect of parents' education on their&#13;
values and attitudes towards schooling.&#13;
Conversely, non-human capital, which enhances a child's productivity&#13;
and thereby increases the shadow price, or the indirect costs, of schooling&#13;
brings about lower levels of schooling among lower asset holders--usually the&#13;
holders of smalL stock, land, and relatively few cattle. Among these holders,&#13;
the price effect is predominant over the income effect and children are drawn&#13;
out of school. RelativeLy large herds of cattle do not appear to have a&#13;
deterrent effect: on schooling. That is, the wealth effect is predominant over&#13;
the price effecl: associaited with higher productivity; the wealthy people can&#13;
afford to hire ]Labor and send some of their own children to school.&#13;
6.5 Summary and ConclusLons&#13;
Three basic economic hypotheses concerning the impact of household&#13;
demographic and socio-economic characteristics on children's schooling in&#13;
Botswana were examined.&#13;
Two of these hypotheses--postulating a positive wealth effect and&#13;
negative price effect on schooling--are supported by the data. The best&#13;
available measure of wealth--the level of education of the head of household&#13;
and its probable effect on values and attitudes--was shown to have the&#13;
expected positive effect on children's schooling; educated parents send more&#13;
children to school and keep them there longer than uneducated parents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 182 -&#13;
On the other hand, when household wealth is expressed in terms of&#13;
assets, which enhance children's productivity, the apparent price effect&#13;
offsets and even dominates the wealth effect at low and intermediate levels of&#13;
wealth.  The wealth effect appears to dominate when households are relatively&#13;
well endowed in cattle. The hypothesis concerning the price effect is further&#13;
supported by the evidence that when substitutes for child labor are available&#13;
in the household, children appear to be "freed" for schooling.&#13;
The third hypothesis, regarding the trade-off between child schooling&#13;
and the number of children in the household, is rejected by the data. This&#13;
suggests that diminishing returns to labor on the farm may lead to&#13;
specialization of labor in the household: specifically, some children may be&#13;
assigned to school and kept there on a comparatively regular basis, while&#13;
others may be assigned to household and farm tasks.&#13;
Role assignment appears to take place among larger cattle owners.&#13;
This finding is of interest especially when compared with the evidence that,&#13;
all other things equal, better educated parents tend to send relatively more&#13;
of their children to school, even if on a less regular basis. This particular&#13;
issue, which warrants more research, may point to a desire on the part of&#13;
parents to maintain particular and equal levels of wealth for their children:&#13;
cattle owners avoid splitting of their stock, which usually goes to the oldest&#13;
son, by sending some children to be educated. The relatively more educated,&#13;
on the other hand, provide equal opportunities by equal education.&#13;
On the whole, the critical decision appears to be whether or not to&#13;
send a child to school. Most children not enrolled have never started&#13;
school. Once a child is enrolled, relatively little can be explained by the&#13;
data concerning the regularity of school attendance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 183 -&#13;
Due to a lack of data, no direct test could be performed regarding&#13;
the effect on education of the availability of schools and their quality.&#13;
Likewise, the presence oi other deterrent factors, on which data are not&#13;
included in this report, should be noted. The most important of these factors&#13;
seems to be the availability of relatively well-paying jobs in the mines,&#13;
which require little or no formal education.&#13;
The 1974 data included in this report have certain implications&#13;
regarding government policy on education. They suggest that the 1978 decision&#13;
to abolish schooling fees was needed in order to make schooling less dependent&#13;
on household wealth. It appears that future policies will have to overcome&#13;
the obstacles to schooling that result from demands on children's time on the&#13;
farm and in the household. Such policies would have to exploit periods of&#13;
relatively slack demand for children's work, and design programs consistent&#13;
with the geographic spread of the population.    It should be stressed that the&#13;
data indicate that a smaLler family size may be a deterrent to education in&#13;
Botswana's current socio-economic environment.&#13;

Behavior in Rural Botswana&#13;

"In a subsistence economy, of course,&#13;
children are an asset: the more hands, the&#13;
more farming can be done.   And when the&#13;
iniant mortality rate is so high it is&#13;
always a good idea to have a few extra&#13;
chi.ldren around. The first child,&#13;
expecially if a girl, is often given to the&#13;
graLndmother to help her in her old age, and&#13;
other children may be given to childless&#13;
relatives. Boys are needed for herding&#13;
cattle and girls for carrying water and&#13;
working in the fields."'&#13;
7.1 Introduction&#13;
This study of the socio-economic correlates of fertility behavior in&#13;
rural Botswana aims to improve our understanding of the interrelationship&#13;
between household characteristics and family formation through fertility&#13;
behavior in Southern Africa.&#13;

The treatment of the data and the findings are presented in&#13;
conjunction with the economic analysis of fertility behavior whereby parents&#13;
derive benefits from children, but have to sacrifice time and other resources&#13;
to being up their offspring.&#13;
An overview of the underlying conceptual and analytical framework is&#13;
presented in the next section. This is followed by two sets of available&#13;
evidence regarding the economic value and costs of children, and the demo-&#13;
graphic and socio-economic characteristics of the women whose fertility&#13;
behavior is studied. Subsequently, socio-economic correlates of fertility&#13;
behavior are analyzed and discussed in conjunction with several hypotheses&#13;
derived from economic models of fertility behavior.&#13;
7.2 Conceptual and Analytic Considerations&#13;
According to economic models of fertility behavior, procreation is&#13;
motivated by the utility, psychic and other, from "children's services" and by&#13;
parents' income, as well as the costs parents incur while raising children.2&#13;
However, as fertility is primarily controlled by biological factors, the&#13;
analysis must take into account parents' capability to achieve the optimal&#13;
number of children they "plan" in light of biological constraints and      -&#13;
imperfect contraception.3 The benefits from children and the costs they incur&#13;

differ across societies of varying levels of economic development as do the&#13;
biological constraints and contraceptive practices. Consequently, the testing&#13;
of specific hypotheses derived from any analytic framework must consider&#13;
various biological constraints and contraception practices.&#13;
In genieral, the economic analysis of fertility behavior postulates&#13;
that higher income brings about a desire for more children because wealthier&#13;
parents can bring up more children to reproductive age than the less&#13;
wealthy. At the same tiime, better and more rewarding opportunities for&#13;
mothers and wou'Ld-be mot7hers in activities other than child care, may inhibit&#13;
their desire for children; the opportunity costs of child care are postulated&#13;
to correlate positively with better market and leisure opportunities for&#13;
women. Moreover, a wish for better educated and healthier children may also&#13;
be associated with a desiLre for fewer children.&#13;
For reasons of maethodology and data, testing of specific hypotheses&#13;
is often restricted by our limited ability to estimate all or even part of the&#13;
factors and strlctural relationships pertaining to fertility behavior. For&#13;
example, mother's educatiLon can affect the cost of rearing children as well as&#13;
the cost of contraception. At the same time, mother's education may&#13;
approximate her health st:atus, and the nature of services she expects from her&#13;
children. Consequently, in most cases the statistical identification and&#13;
measurement of etach single effect associated with, say, education is almost&#13;
impossible. It is important, nonetheless, to establish some "net" effects or&#13;
"reduced form" relationships because such relationships are the ones often&#13;
observed. The discussion which follows attempts to establish statistically,&#13;
by means of simple correlations and regression analysis, how some basic&#13;
maternal and household characteristics relate to fertility behavior.&#13;

7.3 Economic Value and Costs of Children&#13;
The economic motives for high fertility rates have been hypothesized&#13;
in the above cited anthropological observation to be linked with the&#13;
particular socio-economic role of children in Botswana. The socio-economic&#13;
contribution of children is hard to quantify due to the nature of the benefits&#13;
derived from children and the various dimensions that these benefits assume&#13;
through the parents' life cycle. With the data available we can, however,&#13;
present some circumstantial evidence on the economic role of children in rural&#13;
Botswana.&#13;
Table 7.1 presents activities of boys and girls by age. It is clear&#13;
that boys, regardless of age, spend the highest proportion of their non-&#13;
leisure time on animal husbandry. This proportion, along with the proportions&#13;
spent in other income producing activities (columns 1-4) increases with age.&#13;
Girls spend the highest proportion of their time on househoold chores,&#13;
(columns 5-7) and this proportion increases with age. Notable for both boys&#13;
and girls, but for the latter in particular, is the amount of time they spent&#13;
on childcare. On the whole, the 1974 Rural Income Distribution Survey (RIDS)&#13;
data indicate that 24 percent of all working hours in rural Botswana are&#13;
attributed to the population between the ages 6-19 years. It has also been&#13;
shown by Mueller that children's productivity is critically dependent upon the&#13;
availability of assets to the household; i.e., more assets make children more&#13;
productive. Children appear to play a role in both cattle raising and crop&#13;

production, as shown in Chapter 3. It is complicated to attach value to&#13;
children's activities or to the time they "work", especially since children&#13;
may be important in helping the family maintain its economic activity in all&#13;
locations, villages, lands, and cattle posts.&#13;
The contribution of grown children to household income, especially&#13;
when the parents are aged and in female-headed households, is hard to esta-&#13;
blish with the data available. It is already evident, however, that older&#13;
mothers who are unlikely to be economically self-sufficient, reside with their&#13;
children. Only 27 percent of the 206 mothers aged 55 and above reported&#13;
living with no children at home, and even these women tend to be supported by&#13;
children living away from home. The figures in Table 7.2 show the&#13;
relationship between total household income and transfer income of households&#13;
with women aged 55 and above, by the number of their children. There is a&#13;
strong positive correlation between the three columns, indicating the&#13;
likelihood that the welfare of the elderly is closely related to the number of&#13;
children living.4 The figures imply economic security and psychological&#13;
benefits to the elderly in larger families. This is particularly significant&#13;
in an environment with no institutional old age security.&#13;
Information about the costs of children in rural Botswana is also&#13;
indirect. Child care is believed to be a time intensive activity on the part&#13;
of mothers and other females in the household. Mueller shows in Chapter 3&#13;
that the presence of a baby in the household increases home activities of&#13;

females. Additional data with bearing on this matter point out that women&#13;
with higher education have higher wages.5 Moreover, women in households with&#13;
more assets -- land in particular -- and women who head households appear to&#13;
spend more time on income earning activities.6 This evidence implies that&#13;
child rearing incurs higher costs to women who are relatively educated,&#13;
wealthier, and heading households. It also follows that when substitutes for&#13;
the mother in the household are available, ceteris paribus, costs of child&#13;
care may be reduced.&#13;
Direct costs of children in terms of their consumption are not&#13;
available. It is clear, however, that direct expenditures for children&#13;
enrolled in school, for instance, are higher than for children who are not.&#13;
7.4 Demographic and Socio-Economic Characteristics of Mothers&#13;
The demographic characteristics of 858 mothers who responded to the&#13;
fertility questionnaire are shown in Table 7.3.7 As the data pertain to this&#13;
particular population, the proportion of women below age 20, in particular, is&#13;
smaller in this distribution than the proportion of women below 20 in the&#13;
female population of Botswana.8&#13;

income, the data may also signify a positive income effect on&#13;
fertility.  This issue is discussed later on.&#13;

Marriage is not a universal phenomenon in Botswana, and extra-marital&#13;
childbearing does not carry any particular stigma. The figures in column 3&#13;
show that most mothers across all age groups appeared to be living without an&#13;
"eligible" male counterpart during the survey period.9 These figures further&#13;
indicate that, on the average, the probability of an "eligible" husband being&#13;
present in the household, increases with age, up to age group 50-54, and falls&#13;
thereafter. This pattern may reflect, on the one hand, the high propensity of&#13;
young males to migrate, primarily to the mines in South Africa; and, on the&#13;
other hand, the natural pattern of higher mortality rates among older males&#13;
than among their female counterparts.&#13;
In the absence of universal marriage in Botswana, age at marriage&#13;
could not be obtained. Instead, women's age at the birth of the first child&#13;
(column 4) has been used as a proxy for the beginning of the family-building&#13;
process. The slight increase in the figures by age group may reflect stricter&#13;
traditional values in the past against extramarital childbearing.&#13;
The mean number of live births ("children who cried at birth") by&#13;
mother's age group (column 6) increases up to the age category 40-44.&#13;
However, an inconsistent pattern develops beyond that age group.lÂ° These&#13;
figures combine the natural life cycle pattern of fertility, possible cohort&#13;
effects, and inaccuracies in reporting that correlate positively with mother's&#13;

Households in Botswana," forthcoming, in Economic Development and&#13;
lO        Cultural Change.&#13;
Others were excluded from the analysis because of missing and&#13;
inconsistent data. The excluded observations did not appear to&#13;
correlate with any of the variables discussed here. Although the&#13;
number of observations is the actual number available, the data&#13;
presented in this table and others are weighted per weights given in&#13;

age. Overall, mothers who survive to age 50 and above report a mean number of&#13;
6.9 births,  This compares with the unadjusted Botswana national average of&#13;
about 5.6 as reported in the Census.1 The discrepancy between the numbers&#13;
may indicate higher levels of completed fertility in the rural areas of the&#13;
country. The mean number of children dying (column 7) increases naturally&#13;
with mother's age. Of the overall average level, 5.9 live births, only 4.8&#13;
children survive. Most child deaths (67 percent) are reported to have&#13;
occurred before age 6 (column 8).&#13;
The percentage of living children at home (column 9) decreases with&#13;
mother's age. This is consistent with the pattern of children leaving their&#13;
parents' homes as the children grow up. Notable, however, are two points.&#13;
First, young mothers report some children as being away from home; that is,&#13;
young mothers tend to have some of their ch!ildren raised by relatives. This&#13;
phenomenon is common in Botswana, where children may be away at school, are&#13;
"born for" or "loaned" to relatives. Second, on the average, at least one&#13;
child is present in the home even when mothers are relatively elderly. These&#13;
figures allude to the family help given to young mothers who are likely to be&#13;
working, and to the value of children as a means of support in old age.&#13;
The datEL on the desired number of children (columns 10-11) show that&#13;
on the average, mothers who have completed fertility would like to have had&#13;
more children than they actually have. The mean desired number for mothers&#13;
A comparison between the distribution in column 2 of Table 7.3 with the&#13;
relevant distribution in the Census (Republic of Botswana, Report on&#13;
the Population Census, Central Statistics Offices, Gaborone, 1972),&#13;
Table 14/2, p. 124, indicates the difference between the&#13;
distributions. When the Census data are computed for women age 25&#13;
and above they become more consistent with the age distribution of&#13;
mothers as shown in Table. 7.3. On the accuracy of the information&#13;
on reported age, see p. 118 in the Census, ibid.&#13;
&#13;

35-49 is probably more than the number they will actually ever have. The&#13;
averages for lower age groups are close to the average levels of completed&#13;
fertility of the older age groups. This may reflect some changing attitudes&#13;
towards family size. The mothers indicate, on the average, only a slight&#13;
preference for girls (column 11).&#13;
Literacy profiles (column 12) indicate a decreasing ratio of literate&#13;
women by age group.12   This pattern reflects the increasing educational&#13;
opportunities in Botswana over time, thus making education more acccessible to&#13;
younger age groups. It is interesting to note that even in rural areas in&#13;
Botswana, about 50 percent of the mothers report some level of formal&#13;
education.&#13;
The income profiles presented in column 13 do not form any particular&#13;
pattern across age groups. Interestingly enough, relatively high average&#13;
incomes are reported among the young mothers, who apparently live in extended&#13;
households. Only above age 24 do the income profiles assume, on the average,&#13;
a rather universal pattern, increasing up to the fifties and leveling off or&#13;
falling thereafter.&#13;
7.5 Correlates of Fertility Behavior&#13;
The main objective of this section is to examine the economic&#13;
12    These figures must be approached cautiously because they are based on&#13;
defining a "husband" as a male whose age "matched" the mother's and&#13;
who was present in the household during one of the interviews.&#13;
Certainly, among young age groups some matching was done among&#13;
brothers and sisters. More refined data could not be obtained on&#13;
this subject. The demographic bias resulting from this procedure&#13;
does no affect the economic consequences of the presence of a male&#13;
in the household as shown in Chapter 3 and by Mueller and Kossoudji,&#13;
op.cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

hypotheses concerning tlhe effects of household wealth and other characteris-&#13;
tics on fertil:Lty behavior in Botswana. As already mentioned, this examina-&#13;
tion is complicated, as each variable studied presents a host of biological,&#13;
marital, and behavioral effects on the number of children ever born -- the&#13;
measure of fertility used here.&#13;
In the absence of complete information about possible biological&#13;
constraints on fertility behavior, we adopt Easterlin's approach13 for&#13;
interpretation of the findings. This approach postulates that among lower&#13;
socio-economic groups ink developing areas, people have as many children as&#13;
they can; that is, fertility is controlled by biological and marital&#13;
factors. Among higher socio-economic groups, people control their fertility&#13;
behaviorally by practicing family planning.&#13;
Two sets of explanatory variables are considered. The first deals&#13;
with two control variables which are presumed to have biological and marital&#13;
effects on fertility behavior. These two control variables are mother's age&#13;
at birth of the first child and the presence of a male partner ("husband") to&#13;
the woman interviewed. The second set includes socio-economic variables:&#13;
type of househoLd -- extended or nuclear --, mother's level of education, and&#13;
levels of household income and wealth.&#13;
13    This pattern which is also apparent Ln the Census can result from one or&#13;
more of the foLlowing: (i) memory lapse of older females, especially&#13;
concerning children who died, (i:L) a natural selectivity basis,&#13;
i.e., women who have less children tend to live longer, and possibly&#13;
(iii) some of t:he older cohorts indeed had lower levels of fertility&#13;
as suggested by Schapera's findings, reporting 5.4 live births in a&#13;
study population of 184 women past child bearing age. See I.&#13;

Tables 7.4 and 7.5 present the figures showing the statistical&#13;
relationship between fertility and the two sets of variables. Primarily for&#13;
exposition purposes, Table-7.4 shows a two-way classification while Table 7.5&#13;
shows regression coefficients with number of children ever born as a dependent&#13;
variable.14&#13;
The first variable considered, mother's age at birth of the first&#13;
child, combines two effects: the mother's physical ability to have children&#13;
at a particular age, and the decision to start bearing children at that age.&#13;
The two potential effects lead to the same demographic hypothesis: earlier&#13;
childbearing leads to higher levels of fertility, especially in an environment&#13;
where contraception is imperfect. This hypothesis is supported by the data.&#13;
We cannot test, however, to what extent this observation is due to biological&#13;
factors or to behavior.15&#13;
Presence of a "husband" is postulated to be associated with fertility&#13;
in a few ways, all suggesting higher levels of fertility among "married" women&#13;
than among those living with no male partner. First, in a world of imperfect&#13;
contraception, the risk of conception is relatively higher among women living&#13;
with male partners on a regular basis. Second, one assumes that relatively&#13;
more fertile women and those who want more children are more likely to enter a&#13;
marital union. In addition, evidence shows that households headed by males&#13;
are wealthier.16 This may induce a positive income effect on fertility at&#13;
least among low income groups, both because of better maternal health and a&#13;
14   See Report on the Census, op. cit.&#13;
15   Literacy was defined as having above 3 years of schooling.    Above this&#13;
level, women's wages are affected as shown by Chapter 5.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

better economic position.   Furthermore, mothetr with husbands may be relieved&#13;
from income earning activities in favor of more child care.17&#13;
The figures in Table 7.4 show a positive association between the&#13;
presence of a "husband" and level of fertility. However, when statistically&#13;
controlling for household wealth, the effect becomes rather insignificant&#13;
particularly among young cohorts. This may suggest that household wealth may&#13;
be a significant factor associated with fertility behavior especially among&#13;
young cohorts.'8'&#13;
The first of the socio-economic variables considered is type of&#13;
household. This variable: relates to our main hypotheses in a few ways. All&#13;
other things equal, including household income, larger families have less&#13;
income per capita.19 The income effect should therefore induce lower&#13;
fertility levels in extended households than in nuclear households. On the&#13;
other hand, availability of substitutes for the mother, specialization, and&#13;
economies of scaLe in a larger family, may lower the cost of child raising and&#13;
induce relatively higher Levels of fertility in extended families. Hence,&#13;
17   It is interesting to note that when old and young age cohorts are&#13;
combinedin the regression analysis, the presence of a husband&#13;
correlates posistively with fertility. This finding is hard to&#13;
evaluate, as we look at past fertility and relate it to a current&#13;
observation of whether an "eligible" male is present in the&#13;
household. Compared with their sisters who had no male partner, women&#13;
aged 49 and above who had a husband at the time of the survey were&#13;
more likely to have had a husband before. Consequently, the result&#13;
reported here is meaningful. In that case, the data may reflect&#13;
relatively more stringent morals concerning extramarital childbearing&#13;
of the past that was manifest among the elderly.&#13;
18 As no further observations were available, mothers of all age groups are&#13;
combined in the regression analysis. Age is introduced in this&#13;
analysis as a control variable by the (natural) logarithm of age, the&#13;
statistical "fit" of which is consistent with the life cycle pattern&#13;
19      of fertility.&#13;
Attempts to study some of the socio-economic correlates of age at birth&#13;
of first child did not yield any significant results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 202 -&#13;
economic theory does not provide an unequivocal hypothesis with respect to&#13;
this variable.20 The results presented in Tables 7.4 and 7.5 show that&#13;
mothers of extended households have more children than those of nuclear house-&#13;
holds. In economic terms, this suggests that the price effect associated with&#13;
specialization and more help to mothers, dominates the hypothesized negative&#13;
income effect.&#13;
Mother's level of education is one of the key socio-economic&#13;
variables affecting (or predicting) fertility behavior. It relates to a&#13;
variety of biological and behavioral factors affecting the number of children&#13;
ever born. We postulate that the higher the level of parental education, the&#13;
greater the household's wealth and the higher the levels of fecundity and&#13;
fertility. At the same time, beyond some socio-economic threshold, higher&#13;
levels of education are postulated to be associated with fewer children&#13;
because of (i) relatively higher opportunity cost incurred by educated&#13;
mothers, (ii) a desire to use family resources for fewer but more educated&#13;
children, and because (iii) educated parents depend less on their children for&#13;
family income. To these we must add a few factors believed to induce lower&#13;
levels of fertility among the educated: lower child mortality and fewer&#13;
unwanted children due to better knowledge and practice of family planning.&#13;
Our statistical findings show, across all age groups, a negative&#13;
relationship between education and fertility. The data do not permit&#13;
exploration of the specific ways in which education brings about lower levels&#13;
of fertility. Some relevant data, however, are useful in this regard. It has&#13;
been shown by Lucas in Chapter 5 that educated women are more active in the&#13;

incur higher opportunity costs while raising children. Table 7.6 presents&#13;
data showing that compared with their less educated sisters, more highly&#13;
educated mothers have higher incomes, experience less child mortality, and&#13;
provide more education to their offspring. The last two phenomena are&#13;
believed to be associated with lower levels of fertility.&#13;
Family planning is another factor commonly related to the level of&#13;
education. Our data give no indication as to how mothers control their&#13;
fertility behavior. However, since the more highly educated mothers have&#13;
fewer children than the less, the former must practice some form of family&#13;
planning, particularly in view of the assumption that the more educated are&#13;
also the healthier.21 The observed lower levels of fertility with respect to&#13;
education support Easterlin's approach and the universal dominance of the&#13;
anti-natal factors associated with education.&#13;
Household income is another key variable in the economic analysis of&#13;
fertility behavior. We postulated that the wealthier can afford more children&#13;
than the poor although theoretically, the wealthier may opt for better&#13;
educated but fewer children. Moreover, as incomes and cattle ownership are&#13;
closely associated, relatively higher incomes may signify a desire for more&#13;
children who take care of the cattle and help build up a larger family&#13;
stock.22&#13;

mimeo, presented at the Seminar of the Rural Income Distribution&#13;
22      Survey, Gaborone, June 1979.&#13;
Families with children tend to become nuclear because children provide&#13;
parents with the kind of services, social and economic, that can be&#13;
obtained in an extended household: security, help in running the farm&#13;
and household, etc. Hence, in this sense we expect a negative&#13;
correlation between number of children and the observation of an&#13;
extended household.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 205 -&#13;
Table 7.4 presents data indicating on the whole a positive&#13;
association between income deciles giving the relative income position of the&#13;
family, and fertility levels. It must be noted, however, that among older&#13;
cohorts the data undoubtedly reflect the contribution of grown children to&#13;
household income. On the other hand, among young cohorts, children are not&#13;
old enough to make such a contribution. Yet, the positive association is&#13;
still found between income level and fertility.   This finding is maintained&#13;
and becomes statistically significant when household assets -- a better&#13;
measure for household wealth or permanent Income -- are introduced in the&#13;
multivariate analysis reported in Table 7.5. Both relatively higher levels of&#13;
cattle ownership and land show a positive association with fertility levels.&#13;
The impact on fe!rtility of education and income through fewer but&#13;
more highly educated children, was not tested directly in this study, as the&#13;
evidence presented thus far does not support the underlying hypotheses.&#13;
Evidence presented in a previous chapter, shows that both parental education&#13;
and household wealth enhance children's schooling. In addition, it is shown&#13;
that the number of school-age children in the household does not correlate&#13;
negatively with their schooling. The evidence here shows a positive&#13;
association between levels of fertility and household wealth, but a negative&#13;
association with maternal education. Hence, the household wealth appears to&#13;
enhance both the number oi- children and theLr average level of schooling.&#13;
Educated mothers who have fewer children, may indeed in part be motivated by a&#13;
desire for better educated children, but this cannot be established with the&#13;
available data.&#13;
&#13;

7.6 Summary and Conclusions&#13;
The analysis tested a few common economic hypotheses concerning&#13;
fertility behavior in Botswana. The first proposes that the higher the income&#13;
or wealth of the household, the higher will be the levels of fertility. A&#13;
related hypothesis, which could not be tested directly, suggests that parents&#13;
who desire more "benefits" from children may opt for fewer children who are&#13;
more highly educated. A third hypothesis proposes that factors contributing&#13;
to the higher costs of child care will inhibit fertility.&#13;
In interpreting our findings, we have considered biological and&#13;
marital factors in addition to the economic influences on fertility&#13;
behavior. We have found that, on the average, when controlling for age, women&#13;
living with a male partner have more children than those living without a male&#13;
partner. This finding is more pronounced among the older cohorts who&#13;
apparently followed more stringent marital relationships than the younger&#13;
cohorts do. It appears, however, that among the relatively young this effect&#13;
is related to higher incomes associated with the presence of adult males in&#13;
the household, rather than to marital issues involved. Women who give birth&#13;
to their first child at an older age appear to have fewer children in the long&#13;
run.&#13;
Women living in extended households have more children than women of&#13;
nuclear households. This finding is attributed to the relative ease of&#13;
raising children in extended households. This ease appears to offset the&#13;
relatively stringent wealth or income constraints in larger families. Again,&#13;
this effect is more significant in statistical terms when elderly women are&#13;
included in the analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 207 --&#13;
Although closely related to household wealth, when correlating&#13;
education with levels of fertility we find that, ceteris paribus, education&#13;
has a negative impact on fertility behavior. This appears to be the result of&#13;
a host of factors related to the better labor market opportunities available&#13;
to the better educated, better knowledge and more effective use of family&#13;
planning, less child mortality, and a desire for better educated children.&#13;
All other things equal, as predicted by theory, household income or&#13;
wealth appears to produce a positive influence on levels of fertility in spite&#13;
of the evidence that wealthier parents also give their children better&#13;
education.&#13;
From a policy viewpoint, the Government can deal with some of the&#13;
short term pro-.natal effects of rising incomes by the provision of better&#13;
education and particularly wage employment; opportunities for women.   These&#13;
seem to be the basic policy instruments amenable to the Government of&#13;
Botswana, in addition to the already expanding family planning and maternal&#13;
and child health care programs. However, given the apparent role children&#13;
have in helping out their parents, especially at old age, population policy&#13;
must take into account whether other institutions are available to provide the&#13;
social and economic services children provide.&#13;

Chapter 8: Conclusions&#13;
8.1 Introduction&#13;
The studies in this volume portray the micro-economic aspects of&#13;
household behavior of the traditional semi-nomadic people of rural Botswana.&#13;
Our prime objective has been to identify and quantify the obstacles to&#13;
improvement in standards of living and income distribution in rural Botswana,&#13;
a typical Afric&lt;n setting. In particular we have looked at factors which&#13;
limit the growth of household incomes, largely through the rewards for time&#13;
spent at work, or inhibil: the generation of larger incomes through employment&#13;
and productivity. Further, we have looked at constraints on the improvement&#13;
of standards of living over time by reductions in family size and better&#13;
education for children. By means of this slnalysis we hope to convey some&#13;
understanding of the circumstances which perpetuate rural poverty or limit&#13;
sustained rural development.&#13;
Before turning to the general issues, we must first point out some of&#13;
the empirical and analytical problems encountered that may be of use in future&#13;
research on household behavior. Subsequently, we will highlight our basic&#13;
conception of the obstacles to rural development in Sub-Saharan African and&#13;
their policy implications, In doing so we consider not only the 1974 Rural&#13;
Income Distribution Survey (RIDS) findings but knowledge gained from other&#13;
studies of Botswana's rurail development effort and of African rural&#13;
development generally.&#13;

8.2 Analytical Framework and Data&#13;
The underlying models of the previous chapters, based on existing&#13;
micro-economic theory, have been modified to deal with the particular&#13;
environment studied. However, our experience illustrates the need for&#13;
theoretical extensions in order to cope analytically with traditionally rural&#13;
settings. It is clear, for example, that from a micro-economic perspective&#13;
the applicability of our concept of "household" as an economic entity is&#13;
rather unsatisfactory, as we have found that in many traditional settings&#13;
which are in transition, households seem be to somewhat "fluid" entities in&#13;
Botswana. Intrafamilial support systems extend over space and time beyond&#13;
"nuclear" units. For some families, these systems may be efficient&#13;
substitutes for public and institutional assistance programs in times of need,&#13;
such as the failure of crops or at old age. For others, they seem inadequate&#13;
to alleviate acute poverty. For example, unmarried mothers, who head&#13;
households, lack the traditional familial and social network required for&#13;
economic assistance. In future studies it might be useful to collect some&#13;
data on the "availability" of relatives and the history of the "household".&#13;
As in most rural settings, economic activity in Botswana's&#13;
traditional environment is most heterogeneous. Many goods and services are&#13;
produced by the same units at various locations over the course of the year,&#13;
and market prices do not exist for at least some of those goods and&#13;
services. This reality complicates the application of a neo-classical&#13;
analytical framework which rests on the assumption of existing markets with&#13;
known and "observed" prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 211 -&#13;
Traditional analytical approaches rely upon arbitrary assumptions&#13;
about the extent of the household's control over some behavioral derivates.&#13;
For example, it is frequently assumed that some variables, such as the&#13;
household's size and assets, are given, while others - such as the allocation&#13;
of time -- can be manipulated by the household for the sake of its well-&#13;
being. These assumptions ignore critical dynamic issues, and, as such, limit&#13;
the insights into the development process, largely based on capital formation&#13;
and population growth. Hence, the assumption of economics maximization may be&#13;
questionable in a subsistence setting where markets which set prices and wages&#13;
exist for some goods and factors but not for others.&#13;
The RIDS data have yielded rich information concerning incomes by&#13;
levels and sources, and novel information on allocation of time. However, the&#13;
fact that time use data wlere collected for only five days imposes limitations&#13;
on the analysis. Also, for a better understanding of the determinants and&#13;
consequences of lpoverty and income distribution, additional data would have&#13;
been useful, such as information on labor and capital markets, opportunities&#13;
for wage employment, and other facets of the community that pertain to the&#13;
availability of public services like schools, medical services, etc. At the&#13;
household level, RIDS data on migration, remittances from migrants, intra-&#13;
family transfers and parti'cularly on capital formation proved to be of great&#13;
interest but insufficient. More attention should be given to these areas in&#13;
the future to fill the data gaps.&#13;
The various analytical and data problems have been considered in the&#13;
various studies, 'but call for more analytical and methodological attention as&#13;
well as the collection of additional data in the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

8.3 Findings and Implications&#13;
Africans often perceive and describe their continent as an "empty&#13;
land". Botswana aptly fits this description, as its population density is&#13;
very low. While the concept of an "empty land" is seldom defined, it usage&#13;
seems to imply that the population is small relative to productive&#13;
resources. This might conceivably be a correct characterization of Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa, provided one thinks of potential productive resources; i.e.,&#13;
those that are now accessible and developed together with those which require&#13;
future inputs of capital, labor, and technology, before they come into&#13;
existence or become usable.&#13;
If one considers only already developed or available productive&#13;
resources, one may, without much exaggeration, characterize rural Botswana,&#13;
along with many other African countries, as a rather "crowded" land. That is,&#13;
the ratio of labor to other productive resources in the traditional rural&#13;
sector is very high. In consequence, average labor productivity is low.&#13;
The RIDS data point to substantial underemployment of the labor&#13;
force, a logical consequence of low labor productivity. Mueller presents a&#13;
thorough analysis of how people allocate their time, the only universal&#13;
economic endowment. She finds that the agricultural sector of Botswana&#13;
generates insufficient employment for its labor force, although some&#13;
agricultural work is pursued to the point of very low marginal productivity.&#13;
During most seasons of the year there is an apparent "abundance" of leisure&#13;
time, observed in some other African time use studies as well, and marginal&#13;
returns on working time for women and children are close to zero. During the&#13;
busy season males work about 60 percent more than during the slack season.&#13;
Compared with some other African countries, under-employment is accentuated in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 213 -&#13;
Botswana by the low level of crop work and the low level of demand for wage&#13;
labor in farming.   In fact, most wage employment in rural Botswana is in non-&#13;
agricultural pursuits.&#13;
Mueller further shows that, at the micro level, time spent on income&#13;
earning activities is strongly influenced by economic endowments. Households&#13;
with low levels of assets and human capital produce lower economic returns on&#13;
their time and thus are seen to work less. This is particularly true for&#13;
households headed by women who, due to economic circumstances and tradition,&#13;
own less cattle -- the prime asset in Botswana - to use for draught power and&#13;
accumulation of wealth. Labor utilization is also low in those male-headed&#13;
households which are too poor to own cattle.&#13;
Lucas has found that the rural wage labor market appears as a dual&#13;
labor market, in that there exists a higher wage market which is protected by&#13;
government wage-setting policies and encompasses an elite of privileged&#13;
workers; and an "informal" market, probably more closely reflecting the&#13;
opportunity costs of labor, that, according to Mueller, are substantially&#13;
lower than the prevailing rural wage.   However, even this informal wage labor&#13;
market does not offer sufficient work opportunities to the poor to break the&#13;
linkage between low asset holdings and low income. As in many other&#13;
instances, Government minimum wage policies do not improve the situation, and&#13;
may, in fact, be an obstacle to more employment in rural areas.&#13;
The need for employment and income creation in rural areas of&#13;
Botswana implies that productive resources, other than unskilled labor, must&#13;
be greatly increased. The resources in question include infrastructure such&#13;
as irrigation, rural roadsi, electricity, fenicing, agricultural extension and&#13;
research, and marketing facilities. They also include investments in human&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 214 -&#13;
capital, land improvements, equipment, working capital to buy fertilizer and&#13;
other chemicals, and rural industries.&#13;
This conclusion is derived from Lucas's estimates concerning&#13;
agricultural productivity. He estimates a fairly high average product for&#13;
land and infers that land -- or more precisely good, cleared land -- is not&#13;
freely available. The chief competitor for land is cattle grazing, but it is&#13;
also true that overgrazing of cattle land is a serious ecological and economic&#13;
problem. The operation of the Land Boards, competition from cattle for&#13;
pasture land, and traditional tribal rights apparently prevent use of more&#13;
land for farming. Given the land constraint, a pre-condition for the&#13;
expansion of crop output is additional inputs in the form of irrigation,&#13;
fertilizer and other chemicals, equipment, together with the improved&#13;
agricultural sector infrastructure and services referred to above. The&#13;
necessity to raise yields by increasing farm inputs puts the small farmer and&#13;
female headed households at a disadvantage. Lucas further shows that the use&#13;
of modern farming techniques employing irrigation, fertilizers, insecticides,&#13;
and improved equipment has remained very limited in Botswana despite the fact&#13;
that those farmers using them have increased their profits. He finds for&#13;
example that the average household has a minimal investment in equipment;&#13;
mostly in the form of single-row ploughs. Again male-headed households and&#13;
those with more men are substantially better equipped for crop husbandry, at&#13;
least in part because they are generally wealthier.&#13;
Absorption in crop production of the growing group of young job&#13;
seekers - enlarged by the population growth and declining availability of&#13;
jobs in South Africa -- is doubtful under current conditions, according to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 215 -&#13;
Lucas. While tlhe presence of more men could raise crop output, it could do&#13;
so, his analysis indicates, only with greater use of other inputs, especially&#13;
if no additional land were allocated to crop production. Without South&#13;
African mine wages, most households would not be able to afford the necessary&#13;
investments. The need for a good rural credit scheme is evident, if the&#13;
poorer segments of the population are to gain access to modern inputs and&#13;
technology. Lucas suggeEsts in addition, a fertilizer subsidy, price supports&#13;
for outputs, and some form of insurance mechanism, as the high year-to-year&#13;
uncertainty of rainfall acts as a deterrent to the commitment of investible&#13;
funds to crop farming.&#13;
We have referred already to the unequal distribution of productive&#13;
resources needed for crop production, which aggravates the overall shortage.&#13;
Cattle is rural Botswana's major productive resource. RIDS shows that the&#13;
distribution of cattle herds among households is extremely skewed, and later&#13;
data suggest that the distribution may have become more unequal since the mid-&#13;
1970's.1 To make! matters worse, the RIDS data show a positive association&#13;
between land and cattle owmership. Furthermore, an excessive proportion of&#13;
rural savings finds its way into cattle. Cattle herds have grown so rapidly&#13;
that pastoral areas suffer from serious overgrazing.2 Lele found a similar-&#13;
problem in the Lilongwe area of Malawi as well as elsewhere in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa. She observes that "to rural people cattle is often not only an&#13;
economic investment but a source of status and an important feature of the&#13;

community's sociocultural activities."3 One might add that cattle is also&#13;
perceived as a major source of security by rural households. Returning&#13;
migrants tend to invest their savings in cattle, and the desire to start a&#13;
cattle herd or to add to cattle holdings is a strong motivation for hard work,&#13;
enterprise, and thrift. However, there is strong evidence to suggest that the&#13;
Botswana political economy favors cattle ownership through a network of&#13;
subsidies, with the social rate of return to this form of investment somewhat&#13;
lower than the private rate.4&#13;
Given the shortage of productive assets other than cattle, it is&#13;
necessary to make the diversification of assets attractive to the farm&#13;
population. This objective implies that people must be made acquainted with&#13;
the advantages of alternative assets, that they be given access to financing,&#13;
and that these assets provide earnings, security and/or prestige. Examples of&#13;
such assets might be farm and business equipment, land improvements,&#13;
cooperative shares, better housing, or a secondary education for their&#13;
children. Appropriate economic incentive schemes may help in achieving these&#13;
objectives which are critical to rural development.&#13;
A related, but much more controversial policy objective would be the&#13;
redistribution of cattle wealth. The development literature is replete with&#13;
discussions of "land reform." Land reform is important in countries where&#13;
crops are the chief sources of rural incomes. In countries where animal&#13;
husbandry plays a parallel role in the rural economy, cattle redistribution is&#13;

of similar potential significance. Admittedly, the imposition of ceilings on&#13;
household cattle wealth would raise many political, administrative, and&#13;
economic problems. It is not the purpose of this monograph to deal with&#13;
political issues or to ,iesign a workable scheme for redistributing excessively&#13;
large cattle herds.   However, it is worth pointing out, that if large owners&#13;
were forced to relinquish some of their cattle and received compensation, they&#13;
would have an incentive to invest the proceeds in industry, land improvements,&#13;
rural commerce, cooperat:ives and the like. Thus their entrepreneurial effort&#13;
and talent might be directed into new, and. socially more productive&#13;
channels. At least, this is what happened as a result of land reform in&#13;
Taiwan and other East Asian countries. To be sure, cattle raising may entail&#13;
economies of scale which are not present in crop production. However, the&#13;
major efficiency' of a large cattle enterprise would seem to be labor&#13;
savings. If there is, as we have tried to show earlier in this monograph, an&#13;
excess of labor in the countryside during most seasons of the year, including&#13;
young male labor, economiLzing on labor is not a social advantage.&#13;
A further problem is that the absorptive capacity of the agricultural&#13;
sector is limited by the shortage of trained personnel. The need for&#13;
teachers, agricultural scientists, people with technical and vocation skills,&#13;
or with expertise on farming methods far exceeds the available supply.5    The&#13;
shortage of educated people, especially those educated beyond primary school,&#13;
severely limits the amount of experimentation with development programs that&#13;
is feasible, and the amount of flexibility in administering programs that can&#13;
be permitted.&#13;

The RIDS data indicate that, in addition to being socially valuable,&#13;
schooling is a vehicle for improving private welfare. Chernichovsky shows&#13;
that children in rural Botswana play an important role in the household&#13;
economy, particularly in parents' old age, and for single mothers. He finds&#13;
that in spite of low marginal productivity, children's contribution to market&#13;
work (especially animal herding) and housework raises the cost of education.&#13;
The limited opportunities in the wage labor market for primary school leavers&#13;
make for low returns to education. High drop-out rates suggest that parents&#13;
and children are not fully persuaded of the benefits of education.&#13;
Controlling for other factors, children are most likely to attend school when&#13;
their families can financially afford it, when their parents are educated, and&#13;
when demands on children's time for economic work and household chores are not&#13;
too burdensome.&#13;
It appears that the educational system will have to become more&#13;
employment and vocationally oriented, so that parents anticipate a return to&#13;
education other than an uncertain chance of some kind of urban employment.&#13;
Educational planning will have to get around the obstacles to school&#13;
attendance that result from demands on children's time on the farm and in the&#13;
household. Schools will have to exploit periods of slack demand for -&#13;
children's work and tailor facilities more closely to the geographic location&#13;
of the school age population. Secondary education also needs to generate&#13;
skills that are useful in rural areas. With sufficient subsidies of tuition&#13;
fees and other expenses, it should be possible to attract a larger number of&#13;
primary school graduates into secondary schools, especially since the pool of&#13;
these graduates is expanding rapidly. From the Government's viewpoint, there&#13;
is a trade-off between primary and secondary education, with primary education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 219 -&#13;
now being favored. Som,e transfer of funds from the primary to the secondary&#13;
school budget would help the acute needs of the economy for people with&#13;
advanced training.&#13;
Women play an important role in production in Botswana with crop&#13;
cultivation largely a woman's activity. Women also engage in various side-&#13;
line activities such as beer brewing, crafts, or gathering food to supplement&#13;
family income. Moreover, about 30 percent: of households in Botswana are&#13;
either permanen,tly, or for lengthy periods, female-headed. Thus the training&#13;
of women and the creation of employment opportunities for women are essential&#13;
aspects of the upgrading of human capital in rural areas.&#13;
More education and training should also relieve the problem of&#13;
entrepreneurship. It may be argued that in an LDC, entrepreneurship has two&#13;
components: one is the Schumpeterian innovative function which clearly&#13;
depends on knowledge, information, and education, in addition to native&#13;
ingenuity. A second component is a strong motivation to increase earnings by&#13;
seizing available opportunities and by hard work.   The RIDS data suggest that&#13;
the second component is iLn ample "supply". In rural Botswana people are eager&#13;
to enhance their incomes. Where no better alternatives exist, they are&#13;
willing to expend conside!rable labor on tasks of very low productivity. This&#13;
behavior is characteristic not only of the poor, who might otherwise go&#13;
hungry, but also of the well-to-do households. Most households, including&#13;
upper income ones, pursue several rural occupations along with crop production&#13;
and animal husbandry, often including casual wage labor, hunting, and&#13;
gathering. Women may make additional money. by brewing beer, giving parties,&#13;
and handicrafts. The avereage household engages in 5 to 6 income earning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 220 -&#13;
activities.6 Women who do not have a spouse present try to use earnings from&#13;
side occupations to acquire some cattle. What people clearly lack is&#13;
knowledge and information, access to training, productive work opportunities,&#13;
and an attractive price structure.&#13;
We have argued that the major objective for the rural sector must be&#13;
the achievement of a rate of growth of productive capital which substantially&#13;
exceeds the rate of growth of the labor force. It remains to consider the&#13;
possibility of slowing down population growth, and thereby labor force&#13;
growth. An effective family planning program would be valuable component of a&#13;
package of policies relating to rural development. Programs to limit family&#13;
size for health and other social welfare reasons do exist in Botswana. They&#13;
need to be complemented by economic policies which reduce people's perceived&#13;
need for children. Children in rural Botswana play a significant role in&#13;
providing assistance of various kinds, particularly to single women and to ill&#13;
or elderly parents. Chernichovsky's work suggests that the security motive is&#13;
a major reason for high levels of desired fertility in rural Botswana in spite&#13;
of the economic strain, in terms of time and resources, children impose.&#13;
Indeed, parents who can afford relatively more children have higher levels of&#13;
fertility. This behavior is counteracted to a degree by higher levels of&#13;
mothers' education among the well-to-do. Our findings suggest that programs&#13;
to enhance female education and female earning opportunities (but not&#13;
children's employment) could contribute to fertility reduction. Programs to&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 221 -&#13;
provide some minimal security for the aged would serve the same purpose. Such&#13;
programs of course have justification in their own right.&#13;
In summary, from the household perspective, raising the relative&#13;
returns to crop production and generating wage employment in rural industries,&#13;
as opposed to fostering cattle rearing, appear fundamental policy strategies&#13;
for improving income distribution and economic welfare in rural Botswana. In&#13;
the short run, such policies would raise the level of living and the security&#13;
of the poor by provision of employment. In the long run, they might encourage&#13;
smaller families and better educated people among Botswana's future&#13;
generations.&#13;
How can resources be mobilized to enhance rural labor productivity in&#13;
the short run and in the long run? The declared development strategy of the&#13;
Government of Botswana is one of using profits from its prosperous mining&#13;
sector as a source of investment in agriculture to generate employment and&#13;
diffuse welfare. Botswana, like such countries as Mauritania and Nigeria, is&#13;
fortunate to be able to exploit mineral wealth. Yet this dualistic approach,&#13;
in Botswana as in these other countries, has been much less beneficial to the&#13;
rural population than had been hoped. It would appear that future investments&#13;
must be directed, more than past investments have been, toward crop&#13;
cultivation rather than cattle raising, toward the poor rather than the well-&#13;
to-do, and toward job-creating projects rather than social services and&#13;
capital intensive industry.&#13;

            The household economy of rural Botswana :
            an African case
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In an effort to understand the causes of
            poverty and its perpetuation in an African rural economy,
            this study analysed household data from the Rural Income
            Distribution Survey (RIDS) conducted in 1974-75 in Botswana.
            About 85 percent of Botswana's population in the mid
            seventies comprised rural households. More than 50 percent
            of these households were estimated to live below the Poverty
            Datum Line established by the Government. This fact
            underscored Botswana's unequal income distribution: the
            wealthiest 10 percent received 50 percent of rural incomes
            in the mid-l970s. Animal husbandry provided the lion's
            share, 44 percent, of average household income. Farming,
            although pursued with a relatively high share of family
            labor, provided only an estimated 11 percent of income. One
            impediment to improvement of agricultural incomes was the
            relative unavailability of good cleared land for farming.
            This situation affected adversely mostly female-headed
            households because they had limited access to productive
            assets, including cattle, and to wage employment.
            Improvement in the quality of life among Botswana's
            rural population at the time of the survey, seemed to
            require raising the relative returns to crop production, and
            generating wage employment in the rural areas.
