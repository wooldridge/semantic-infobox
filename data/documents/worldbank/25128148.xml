The World Bank strives to be a leader in climate action with its&#13;
comprehensive program to measure, reduce, offset, and report&#13;
greenhouse gas emissions from Bank facilities and corporate&#13;
activities. Its Washington, DC-based buildings and travel have&#13;
been carbon-neutral since 2007. On the global corporate level,&#13;
facilities and travel achieved carbon-neutrality in 2009.&#13;
