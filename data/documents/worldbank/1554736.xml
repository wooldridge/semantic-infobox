ABSTRACT&#13;
The impact of dropping taxation of rice exports in Thailand on&#13;
family welfare and rice production is analyzed in this paper. Models of&#13;
household production and consumption decisions are used in the analysis of&#13;
selected farm households in the Northeast and Upper North regions of the&#13;
country. The objective is to assess the effects of variation in land&#13;
quality, farm and family size on welfare and on supply response to rice tax&#13;
policy. The analysis specified three farm sizes and three family sizes,&#13;
though these differed between regions, with land quality remaining a&#13;
regional variable.&#13;
While the effects on short run welfare differ among farm sizes,&#13;
family sizes, price domains and regions, they are explained by one&#13;
circumstance: households that become net purchasers of rice are worse off,&#13;
while households selling rice are better off. In the longer run, evidence&#13;
from macroeconomic studies suggests that adjustments in the nominal wage&#13;
for off-farm employment will offset welfare losses by purchasing&#13;
households.&#13;
Supply response, as measured by arc elasticities, also varies by&#13;
farm size, price domain and region, with larger farms, especially those&#13;
operated by smaller sized families, providing the strongest responses.&#13;
Overall, supply response has an elasticity of 0.3 (in both regions) for&#13;
those price intervals relevant to the measurement of the effects of&#13;
dropping the policy of rice export taxation.&#13;

CONDENSE&#13;
Ce document analyse l'effet qu'aurait l'abandon de la taxation&#13;
des exportations de riz sur le bien-etre des menages et la production de&#13;
riz en Thailande. On a utilise des modeles de programmation des d6cisions&#13;
des menages en matiere de production et de consommation pour analyser le&#13;
comportement de plusieurs familles agricoles dans le nord-est et la region&#13;
la plus au nord du pays. I1 s'agit d'evaluer les effets des differences&#13;
de qualite de sol, de taille de l'exploitation et de la famille sur le&#13;
bien-tre et la production lorsque la politique de taxation du riz&#13;
change. L'analyse sp6cifie trois tailles d'exploitation et trois tailles&#13;
de famille, qui different selon les r6gions, alors que la qualit6 du sol&#13;
reste une variable regionale.&#13;
A court terme, les effets sur le bien-etre varient selon la&#13;
taille de l'exploitation, la taille de la famille, la fourchette des prix&#13;
et la r6gion, mais ils s'expliquent par un seul facteur : les menages qui&#13;
deviennent acheteurs nets de riz y perdent et ceux qui vendent du riz y&#13;
gagnent. A long terme, les etudes macroeconomiques laissent a penser que&#13;
les ajustements du salaire nominal pour l'emploi hors-exploitation com-&#13;
pensera les pertes subies par les menages acheteurs.&#13;
L'offre, mesur6e par les elasticit6s d'arc, varie aussi selon la&#13;
taille de l'exploitation, la fourchette des prix et la region, l'elasti-&#13;
cit6 la plus forte etant enregistr6e dans les grandes fermes, surtout&#13;
celles qui sont exploitees par de petites familles. Dans l'ensemble,&#13;
l1'lasticit6 de l'offre est de 0,3, dans les deux r6gions 6tudiees, pour&#13;
les intervalles de prix a considerer si l'on veut mesurer les effets&#13;
qu'aurait l'abandon de la politique de taxation des exportations de riz.&#13;

EXTRACTO&#13;
En este docunento se analizan los efectos de la eliminaci6n de&#13;
los impuestos a las exportaciones de arroz en Tailandia sobre el bienestar&#13;
familiar y la producci6n de arroz. Se utilizan modelos de producci6n&#13;
familiar y decisiones relativas al consumo en el analisis de unidades&#13;
familiares agricolas seleccionadas en las regiones nordeste y extremo&#13;
norte del pais. El objetivo es evaluar los efectos de la variaci6n de la&#13;
calidad de la tierra y el tamanio de las explotaciones y la familia sobre&#13;
el bienestar y la reacci6n de la oferta a la politica tributaria sobre el&#13;
arroz. En el anAlisis se especificaron tres tamanios de explotaciones y de&#13;
familias, aunque los tamaiios diferian entre las regiones, siendo la&#13;
calidad de la tierra una variable regional.&#13;
Si bien los efectos sobre el bienestar a corto plazo difieren&#13;
segun los tamaiios de las explotaciones y de las familias, los precios y&#13;
las regiones, se explican por una circunstancia: las unidades familiares&#13;
que son compradoras netas de arroz estan en peores condiciones, en tanto&#13;
que las que lo venden estAn en mejor situaci6n. A mas largo plazo, las&#13;
pruebas derivadas de estudios macroecon6micos sugieren que los ajustes en&#13;
el salario nominal para el empleo fuera de las explotaciones compensarAn&#13;
las perdidas en materia de bienestar de las unidades familiares&#13;
compradoras.&#13;
La reacci6n en cuanto a la oferta, medida por las elasticidades&#13;
arco, tambien varia segun el tamanio de la explotaci6n, los precios y la&#13;
regi6n, siendo las mayores granjas, en especial las explotadas por&#13;
familias mAs pequeiias, las que tienen las reacciones mAs vigorosas.     En&#13;
general, la reacci6n de la oferta tiene una elasticidad de 0,3 (en ambas&#13;
regiones) para los intervalos de precios que son pertinentes a la medici6n&#13;
de los efectos de eliminar la politica tributaria relativa a las&#13;
exportaciones de arroz.&#13;

Summary and Conclusions&#13;
Thailand's agricultural sector accounts for a quarter of total&#13;
GDP, 60 percent of all exports and 70 percent of employment. During&#13;
1960-75, the sector performed exceptionally well and was able to achieve a&#13;
growth rate exceeding 5 percent annually. Since 1975, however, growth has&#13;
slowed to about 3.5 percent annually. This deterioration resulted&#13;
primarily from an increasing shortage of land suitable for agriculture.&#13;
Earlier growth had been achieved mostly through expansion of the cultivated&#13;
area. If Thailand's agricultural sector is to regain its momentum, crop&#13;
production must be both intensified through greater use of purchased inputs&#13;
and diversified into higher value products.&#13;
Our focus is on rice for several important reasons: (i) It is&#13;
the heart of the agricultural sector, accounting for 40 percent of&#13;
agricultural GDP and 35 percent of agricultural exports. (ii) Rice&#13;
accounts for over one-half of the calories in the Thai diet, and it is the&#13;
wage good most affecting the cost of living of the Thai consumer. (iii)&#13;
Rice growing households are 98 percent of the 4 million farm families,&#13;
accounting for 55 percent of total population and 66 percent of the labor&#13;
force. Since World War II, rice export taxation, which averaged 35 percent&#13;
of FOB value, has performed several critical functions: (a) it has served&#13;
to transfer surplus from the farmer to urban employers and government,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
serving as an important source of development finance, and (b) it has&#13;
buffered domestic rice prices from international price shocks. Decades of&#13;
such taxation has kept the intensity of input use (and thus paddy yield) at&#13;
a low level. Such a discentive to intensification was an acceptable&#13;
trade-off because surpluses could still be generated from new lands.&#13;
Now that suitable rice land is essentially exhausted and rice&#13;
revenues are no longer an important source of government revenues, Thailand&#13;
can no longer afford the efficieny losses from rice taxation. The question&#13;
that remains is the effect on rice supply and rural welfare of elimination&#13;
of the system of rice export taxation. This study focusses on the impact&#13;
of public policy toward rice prices on farm households in two important and&#13;
relatively poor regions of Thailand. Together, these regions account for&#13;
about one half of the farm households and culti'Tated farm land in the&#13;
country, and their share in national rice production averaged 40 percent&#13;
over the 1959-1980 period.&#13;
The impact of rice taxation on family welfare and rice production&#13;
for selected farm household types in the Northeast and Upper North regions&#13;
was analyzed using programming models of household production-consumption&#13;
decisio,ns. The objective was to assess the effect of variation in land&#13;
quality, farm size and family size on the welfare impact of and supply&#13;
response to rice policy. The analysis specified three farm sizes and three&#13;
family sizes, though these differed between regions, with land quality&#13;
remaining a regional variable. Many experiments were done for households&#13;
specific to individual provinces (changwats), but variation within regions&#13;
is sufficiently small to discuss the results in terms of representative&#13;
regional farm and household types.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
With respect to welfare impact, it is important to distinguish&#13;
between short run and long run impacts, where the long run allows&#13;
sufficient time for full adjustment of labor markets. Short run welfare&#13;
impacts were determined by calculating Laspeyres and Paasch price indices,&#13;
which in most instances were sufficient to establish whether the change in&#13;
nominal income was a welfare improvement or not. For the Northeast, the&#13;
calculations on welfare impact were clearcut. For all family sizes and&#13;
price intervals, small farmers are worse off with an increase in rice&#13;
price. For almost all family sizes and price intervals, large farmers are&#13;
better off with the price increase. For medium sized farms, low and median&#13;
sized families are better off, while large families are worse off. The&#13;
reason for this pattern of welfare changes is quite simple--farm households&#13;
which are net purchasers of rice are worse off, and farm households which&#13;
are net sellers of rice are better off. Thus, for medium sized farms, low&#13;
and median sized families are net sellers, while large families are net&#13;
purchasers.&#13;
For the Upper North, the calculations of welfare impact are more&#13;
varied, reflecting the increased opportunities for profitable resource&#13;
reallocation due to rice price change in this region, but the underlying&#13;
reasons for the pattern of welfare changes is the same. Thus, low sized&#13;
families on small farms can become net sellers over some price intervals,&#13;
while median and large size families on small farms remain net purchasers,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and this circumstance explains the pattern of welfare impacts on small&#13;
farms.  For medium and large sized farms, the welfare impact is usually&#13;
positive (i.e., they are net sellers) for all family sizes over most price&#13;
intervals. One distinct difference between the patterns of the two regions&#13;
is that all farm and household sizes in the Upper North have a welfare loss&#13;
over the lowest price interval. The reasons is that at such low prices,&#13;
rice cannot compete effectively with other alternative crops and all&#13;
families become net purchasers of rice.&#13;
In summary, for both regions, approximately 40 percent of farm&#13;
households would suffer a short run welfare loss due to an increase in the&#13;
price of rice. For the longer run, evidence from multi-sector&#13;
macroeconomic analyses suggests that the real wage for unskilled labor is&#13;
invariant to the price of rice. This implies that short run welfare losses&#13;
by net purchasing small farm households wilt diminish toward zero in the&#13;
longer run, since net purchasing households will recover loss of purchasing&#13;
power due to rice price increases through offsetting increases in nominal&#13;
wages for off-farm employment.&#13;
Supply response was measured in terms of arc elasticities over&#13;
the same set of price intervals. For the Northeast, the supply response of&#13;
small farms is zero everywhere, and medium sized farms have positive&#13;
elasticities only over the two lowest price intervals. Only low and median&#13;
sized families on large farms have positive elasticities over a significant&#13;
range of prices. This pattern makes sense when the context of the&#13;
Northeast is considered--overwhelmingly rainfed farming, with 70 percent of&#13;
land in the wet season devoted to rainfed paddy, confronted with a highly&#13;
variable rainfall pattern that makes intensification risky. In contrast to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the Northeast, small farmers in the Upper North have positive elasticities&#13;
at low and very high prices for all family sizes. A similar pattern holds&#13;
for all family sizes on medium sized farms, while families on large farms&#13;
have positive elasticities over virtually all price intervals. This sharp&#13;
behavioral contrast with that of farmers in the Northeast is due to the&#13;
richer set of production possibilities that a significant irrigation capa-&#13;
city provides for farmers of the Upper North.&#13;
Overall supply elasticities can be calculated from the estimates&#13;
for farm and household sizes using an appropriate set of weights, and this&#13;
was done.   These calculations indicated for the Northeast an average       I&#13;
elasticity of about 0.9 for the three lower price intervals and 0.3 for the&#13;
upper three price intervals. Similar calculations for the Upper North&#13;
yield an average elasticity of 2.0 for the lower three and 0.3 for the&#13;
upper three price intervals.&#13;
These results point out not only the importance of farm endowment&#13;
but also the often critical effect of family size in determining the status&#13;
of surpluses/deficits and thus the welfare and supply response character-&#13;
istics. Off-farm income and migration opportunities which permit reduction&#13;
in family members depending on agriculture can generate greater supply&#13;
response and improved family welfare. An alternative for achieving these&#13;
ends is policies which increase labor productivity in agriculture, e.g.,&#13;
research on high-yielding varieties adapted to Thai environments and&#13;
improved extension service, and thus by lowering costs retain Thailand's&#13;
comparative advantage in agricultural exports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. Introduction and Background&#13;
This paper presents some results on the impact of public policy&#13;
toward rice prices on farm households in two important and relatively poor&#13;
regions of Thailand. Together, these two regions account for about one&#13;
half of the farm households and cultivated farm land in the country, as&#13;
Table 1 indicates. The share of these regions in national rice production&#13;
averaged 40 percent over the 1959-80 period. Average per capita rural&#13;
income in 1975-76 is estimated at 62 percent of the overall national aver-&#13;
age for the northeast and 66 percent for the upper north. Since agricul-&#13;
ture still accounts for 70 percent of total employment in Thailand and per&#13;
capita agricultural incomes averaged 76 percent of non-agricultural incomes&#13;
in 1975-76, it is clear that these two regions account for a major share of&#13;
the poor in Thailand.&#13;
The history of rice policy in Thailand has been summarized&#13;
superbly by Siamwalla and the interested reader is referred to his paper.&#13;
However, several important aspects of policy do deserve emphasis here.&#13;
First, although Thailand has exported rice for well over a century, signi-&#13;
ficant export taxation of rice is relatively recent--since World War II.&#13;
Second, while the objectives of rice taxation appear to have received&#13;
differing priorities over time, e.g., the revenue objective has diminished&#13;
in relative importance, the policy has normally aimed at keeping prices&#13;
down. Thai rice prices have consistently been among the lowest in Asia.&#13;
Third, apart from early use of multiple exchange rates and sporadic use of&#13;
quantitative controls, the policy has operated by driving a tax wedge&#13;
between domestic and world prices.&#13;

II.  Key Issues in Analyzing Rice Price Policy in Thailand&#13;
While it is true that the microeconomics of rice are simple, the&#13;
macroeconomics and its associated political economy can be quite compli-&#13;
cated. For this reason, an understanding of certain perennial issues in&#13;
Thai political economy is essential to a thorough analysis of rice policy.&#13;
A.   Role of Rice in the Thai Economy&#13;
The key to understanding Thai rice policy is a firm grasp of the&#13;
implications of the dual role of rice as a commodity. As the source of&#13;
over half the calories in the Thai diet, it is the pre-eminent wage good.&#13;
As the largest source of export earnings, it is the cornerstone of trade&#13;
and development policy. Thus, it simultaneously the principal commodity&#13;
price in the determination of both the internal and external terms of&#13;
trade. Put differently, the price of rice is an important determinant of&#13;
the urban real wage, the direction and magnitude of intersectoral transfer&#13;
of savings, the rate of agricultural development and level of rural&#13;
welfare, intersectoral labor migration and foreign exchange earnings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
Let us consider first the essentially simple microeconomics of&#13;
rice price policy.   On the demand side, an increase in the price of rice&#13;
has the usual substitution and income effects on all consumers.     The&#13;
substitution effect is negative, of course, but perhaps small. Since rice&#13;
is both a normal good (for virtually all Thai consumers) and the major&#13;
source of calories for most consumers, the income effect is both negative&#13;
and relatively strong. The overall effect on a pure consumer is clearly&#13;
negative, and estimates of the uncompensated price elasticity of demand&#13;
range from -.3 to -.6.&#13;
On the supply side, there are also income and substitution&#13;
effects from an increase in the price of rice. The income effect can be&#13;
defined as the increase in net revenue (or opportunity cost) per unit of&#13;
rice for existing (mean) production. Note that for a pure subsistence&#13;
farmer, the demand and supply side income effects are of equal magnitude&#13;
but opposite sign and they exactly cancel. Thus, only farmers who either&#13;
sell or buy rice have a non-zero income effect overall. However, all&#13;
farmers will have a positive substitution effect, which is defined as the&#13;
change in (mean) rice production induced by a change in the price of rice,&#13;
ceteris paribus.   Thus, the substitution effect in supply is defined analo-&#13;
gously to the demand side effect and neglects multi-market interactions in&#13;
demand and supply. The supply response from the substitution effect can&#13;
be decomposed into short run impact and long run equilibrium responses&#13;
since some resources can be shifted to rice production from other employ-&#13;
ments only after a delay--e.g., leveling and bunding land for rice&#13;
cultivation. Supply price elasticities can be measured by econometric&#13;
methods and existing estimates for all of Thailand range from .2 to .4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
However, casual empirical evidence suggests that the supply elasticity for&#13;
the northeast may be lower owing to 1) highly variable rainfall which makes&#13;
intensification risky, 2) lack of significant irrigation potential, and 3)&#13;
unsuitability of remaining upland to paddy cultivation.&#13;
In addition to the income and substitution effects, there is&#13;
another effect, the wealth effect, for landowning farmers. This effect&#13;
corresponds to the capitalized value of the increase in land rent on land&#13;
specialized to rice due to the price increase. The wealth effect will only&#13;
be significant for price increases expected to be permanent; and for this&#13;
reason, the rise in land prices may occur with a lag after a permanent&#13;
increase in the price of rice. The wealth effect occurs for all owners of&#13;
intra-marginal paddy land, irrespective of whether or not they are net&#13;
sellers or purchasers or pure subsistence farmers. However, net purchasing&#13;
or subsistence farmers can only realize the wealth increment by selling&#13;
their land. Thus, significant increases in the price of rice may result in&#13;
some tendencies toward consolidation of land into larger units. Small&#13;
farmers who are net purchasers on average would clearly have the strongest&#13;
incentive to sell land.&#13;
Turning to the multi-market and macroeconomic effects of an&#13;
increase in rice prices, the most interesting spillovers occur via the&#13;
labor market. The existing literature is quite clear with respect to the&#13;
responsiveness of Thai labor markets to real wage differentials--see&#13;
Bertrand, Bertrand and Squire and World Bank (1983). The decrease in the&#13;
urban real wage for unskilled labor due to an increase in the price of rice&#13;
will induce an intersectoral reallocation of labor by means of reduced&#13;
rural-to-urban migration (or even a possible reverse flow for a large price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
increase). The induced decrease in additions to the urban labor supply&#13;
will tend to drive up nominal urban wages for unskilled labor until equili-&#13;
brium is reached between the urban and rural markets.     The net long run&#13;
effect of the price increase on urban real wages is not clear theoretically&#13;
since it depends on factor substitution elasticities and resource realloca-&#13;
tions in a number of markets. However, the problem can be assessed quanti-&#13;
tatively by means of numerical simulation with a price endogenous, multi-&#13;
sector, macroeconomic model. Since the construction of such a model is a&#13;
non-trivial task, it is fortunate that one already exists --the Siam II&#13;
model built by the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB)&#13;
and the World Bank in collaboration. Dr. Piyawasti Amranand has reported&#13;
the results of rice price policy experiments using Siam II for a range of&#13;
assumptions regarding the elasticity of export demand for Thai rice, and&#13;
finds that the short run impact of a 5 percent reduction in ad-valorem&#13;
export duty on the urban real wage of casual labor was an 0.8 percent&#13;
reduction, while given time for labor reallocation, the urban real wage of&#13;
casual labor increased by 0.2 percent. The net effect on GDP and overall&#13;
consumption was also positive, as it was for investment given realistic&#13;
estimates of export demand elasticities. The Siam II simulation experi-&#13;
ments suggest that urban real wages are invariant to an increase in rice&#13;
price, and the mechanism of adjustment is reallocation of labor such that&#13;
nominal wages adjust upward to hold real wages constant. Also, the&#13;
increase in nominal wages means decreased returns to capital for urban&#13;
employers, which suggests that the real urban beneficiaries of rice export&#13;
taxation are employers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
B. The Role of Thailand in the International Rice Market&#13;
The issue of the degree of power, if any, that Thailand can&#13;
command in the world rice market has been central to the policy debate over&#13;
rice export taxation. There is some evidence that the motives for export&#13;
taxation were initially stabilization of the domestic price at a low level&#13;
(to keep the real cost of public employment low) and revenue. Subsequent-&#13;
ly, concern over the optimal tariff level arose in the 1960s. Kridakara&#13;
and Usher asserted that the internal rice trade was competitive and the&#13;
export elasticity of demand was very high, in the long run approximating&#13;
the infinite elasticity of the competitive model. This latter claim was&#13;
derived from the argument that the world market is essentially competitive&#13;
and Thailand has a very small share (i.e., about 3 percent) of world&#13;
production. Given their premises, it is easily shown that the incidence of&#13;
export taxation is borne by the farmers. Critics of this position argue&#13;
that the wide variability of national rice prices demonstrates that&#13;
national policy measures are keeping the international rice market from&#13;
behaving competitively. Rather, they argue, a better indicator of Thai-&#13;
land's market power is its share of total world exports-- see Siamwalla and&#13;
Bertrand.&#13;
The econometric evidence with respect to the export price elasti-&#13;
city of rice for Thailand is mixed. Tsujii reported an export elasticity&#13;
of one, which implies that marginal revenue has been driven to zero. Wong&#13;
estimated an elasticity of four and computed an optimal export tax of 25&#13;
percent. However, both of these estimates were derived from short run&#13;
models that assumed no countervailing response to export taxation by&#13;
importing countries. This turn-the-other-cheek response by purchasers is a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
necessary assumption of the usual argument for an optimal tariff, and its&#13;
empirical relevance is open to question in a market dominated by national&#13;
policy restrictions on both sides of the market. In particular, 26 to 50&#13;
percent of Thai exports have been government to government sales, and the&#13;
negotiating environment for bilateral bargaining is very likely to shift&#13;
adversely against a seller who consistently drives a hard bargain. From&#13;
this viewpoint, the level of the rice premium may be set by pattern-setting&#13;
government-to-government sales, and this observation is consistent with the&#13;
pattern of changes in export taxation (via the rice premium) with changes&#13;
in world market conditions. The obvious response of the rice exporter to&#13;
exploitative market power is policy measures to expand domestic production&#13;
and reduce dependence on imports. The emergence of high yielding dwarf&#13;
varieties in the 1960s certainly facilitated such a strategy. The evidence&#13;
on the Thai share of world rice exports, which declined from an average of&#13;
25 percent in the 1950s to 10 percent in the mid 1970s, is consistent with&#13;
this conjecture on the countervailing response. A rigorous analysis of Thai&#13;
market power and possible countervailing strategies by major importing&#13;
countries would require analysis using a world market model with long run&#13;
policy conditioned national demand and supply functions for all major&#13;
participants.&#13;
Another important long run effect of the export taxation has been&#13;
the disincentive to invest in new technology and/or new productive capacity&#13;
that a large tax wedge creates. This is true at all levels--the farmer&#13;
confronted with risky and expensive new techniques, fertilizer producers&#13;
and/or importers considering capacity increases, etc. Thus, a large tax&#13;
tends to create dynamic comparative disadvantage. The international&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
evidence with respect to rice yields shows Thailand lagging significantly&#13;
behind other Southeast Asian producers. Due to high yielding new varieties&#13;
derived from application of methods from modern genetic and molecular&#13;
biology, rice yields have increased more in the past two decades than in&#13;
the preceding seven thousand years, and Thai public policy has minimized&#13;
the impact of this unprecedented technical change on Thai farmers. While&#13;
Thailand has compensated by relying on expansion of cultivated rice acreage&#13;
to achieve growth in production, this strategy will be increasingly&#13;
difficult to implement.&#13;
C. Taxation as a Means of Extracting an Investible Agricultural Surplus&#13;
In the early stages of development, an economy is primarily&#13;
agrarian. It follows from this circumstance that the major source of&#13;
domestic savings for the investment in infra-structure and non-agricultural&#13;
production facilities necessary to achieve the structural transformation&#13;
implied by development must be the agricultural sector. That is, an&#13;
investible surplus must be transferred from the agricultural sector. One&#13;
common means of achieving this objective is taxation (either explicit or&#13;
implicit) that turns the terms of trade against the agricultural sector.&#13;
If the agricultural sector is producing an exportable surplus, then export&#13;
taxation is often preferred for administrative efficiency and convenience.&#13;
By depressing the domestic price through a tax wedge, the terms of trade&#13;
are turned against agriculture; and if the agricultural export is the wage&#13;
good, this may, as we have seen, reduce the wage bill of employers in the&#13;
non-agricultural sector, increasing profits and presumeably investment in&#13;
that sector. In addition, the revenue from the tax will put resources at&#13;
the disposal of government, and these may be used for investment in&#13;
infra-structure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
In addition to direct taxation, agricultural exports may be taxed&#13;
directly by any policy measure that depresses the foreign exchange rate&#13;
from the rate that would otherwise prevail.    During the early post World&#13;
War II years, a system of multiple exchange rates was used to accomplish&#13;
most of the export taxation in Thailand.     The policy of multiple exchange&#13;
rates was abandoned in 1955, and the present system of export taxes was&#13;
erected. However, over the years a variety of tariffs on imports of&#13;
non-agricultural goods have been imposed to protect an import substituting&#13;
industrialization.   In the absence of these tariffs, non-agricultural&#13;
imports would be significantly greater, and hence the equilibrium foreign&#13;
exchange rate would be significantly higher. The difference between the&#13;
equilibrium foreign exchange rates with and without the import tariffs on&#13;
non-agricultural goods is a measure of the implicit taxation on&#13;
agricultural exports.&#13;
Turning to the historical evidence, in the early post World War&#13;
II period, revenue from rice export taxation averaged about 25 percent of&#13;
total government revenue.   By the late 1970s, the share of rice taxation in&#13;
revenues had dropped to about 2 percent. Throughout the period since 1947,&#13;
taxation of rice through multiple foreign exchange rates and direct&#13;
taxation has averaged 30 to 40 percent of the world price. This has kept&#13;
domestic prices significantly below world prices, significantly reducing&#13;
real wage costs to non-agricultural employers. Thus, both the direct&#13;
taxation of rice and the implicit taxation through import tariffs have&#13;
stimulated import substituting industrialization, and constitute the&#13;
principal mechanism by which an agricultural surplus was transferred to&#13;
non-agricultural development purposes. Some evidence with respect to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
effect of import tariffs on Thai industrialization is provided by some&#13;
experiments by Faber and Kennes, using THAM-I, a price endogenous,&#13;
multi-sector, macroeconomic model of Thailand with a fully developed&#13;
agricultural sector. The experiments simulated the response of the Thai&#13;
economy to a reduction of import tariffs on non-agricultural commodities&#13;
from an average of 50 percent in 1980 to zero in 1989. When compared with a&#13;
base case experiment in which no policy changes were assumed, the growth&#13;
rate of GDP remained the same, but the share of agriculture in GDP&#13;
increased to 31 percent as compared with 18 percent in the base case.&#13;
While the latter percentage is an underestimate, indicating some weakness&#13;
in calibration, the large increase in agriculture's share when tariffs are&#13;
reduced sharply signals a significant resource reallocation. Over the&#13;
1980-89 period, the growth rate of agriculture was 8.6 percent a year in&#13;
the tariff reduction case as compared to 3.9 percent in the base case. In&#13;
the tariff reduction case, non-agricultural growth was 5.5 percent compared&#13;
to 6.9 percent in the base case. The dramatic resource reallocation&#13;
indicated by these experiments implies significant implicit taxation of&#13;
agriculture by means of import tariffs, probably of the same order of&#13;
magnitude as the direct taxation of rice. Of course, the indirect taxation&#13;
is a burden on all agricultural exports, and thus is more important overall&#13;
in transferring surplus.&#13;
Considering the quite heavy taxation of rice, both explicit and&#13;
implicit, that has characterized recent decades, the magnitude and nature&#13;
of the supply response of Thai farmers is of some interest. Data from&#13;
Bank's latest agricultural sector review for Thailand show that area&#13;
planted to paddy has increased from 37 million rai in 1960 to 60 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
rai in 1980, while yields showed only a slight upward trend. Over the same&#13;
two decades, rice yields more than doubled worldwide in the most explosive&#13;
technical advance (due to new high yielding varieties) in the seven&#13;
thousand year history of rice cultivation in Asia. Thus, an increase in&#13;
paddy production from 10 million tons in 1962 to 17.8 million tons in 1982&#13;
was generated almost entirely by expanding the area under cultivation, in&#13;
sharp contrast with the increase in intensity that occurred in almost all&#13;
other producing nations. While conditions were somewhat less favorable to&#13;
intensification in Thailand, the disincentive created by the heavy&#13;
burden of taxation clearly accounts in significant part for the failure of&#13;
Thai yields to increase in an era of extraordinary technical advance.&#13;
Since the increase in cultivated acreage was due very largely to bringing&#13;
new lands under cultivation, Thailand was most fortunate in possessing&#13;
unutilized land resources. The existence of these resources, which per-&#13;
mitted a pure land extensive expansion similar to the opening of new lands&#13;
in North America, Argentina and Australia earlier, made feasible several&#13;
decades of heavy taxation of agriculture, especially rice production, that&#13;
permitted transfer of a significant agricultural surplus to development&#13;
purposes. Now that the era of area expansion in Thailand is drawing to a&#13;
close, a dramatic shift in agricultural policy looms as an emerging&#13;
necessity.&#13;

III. Analytical Framework of the Study&#13;
A. A Model of Farm Household Production and Consumption Decisions&#13;
The peasant farm household is distinguished in economic terms&#13;
from the urban worker household chiefly by the high degree of interdepen-&#13;
dence between household production and consumption decisions. The separa-&#13;
tion between production and consumption is almost complete in urban worker&#13;
households, with the money income derived from sale of labor services by&#13;
household members used to purchase almost all of the commodities in the&#13;
consumption bundle of the household.     Thus, the familiar equalities of&#13;
neoclassical demand and production theory hold for such households--e.g.,&#13;
the marginal rate of substitution in consumption between any two goods&#13;
actually consumed is equal to the ratio of their market prices. In the&#13;
case of the peasant farm household which inputs the labor services of&#13;
family members into agricultural production along with other inputs owned&#13;
or purchased, the relevance of the full set of neoclassical conditions for&#13;
household equilibrium depends critically on access to market opportunities&#13;
for off-farm employment and on the technical feasibility of substitution&#13;
between inputs in production if the Fisherian separation of production and&#13;
consumption is to be realized. These are strong conditions, and the&#13;
absence of temporally continuous markets for labor services and/or long&#13;
term credit (up to the limit of the household wealth constraint) are often&#13;
cited as typical gaps in the set of requisite markets for peasant agricul-&#13;
ture in developing countries. Of course, when there are missing markets or&#13;
markets are interlinked, agents still seek to satisfy their preferences&#13;
with respect to the set of choices facing them, but the optimal choices may&#13;
be corner solutions that do not meet the neoclassical equalities. In such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
contexts, the agents' choices can be analyzed by explicitly taking into&#13;
account the constraints that define the set of feasible actions, which is&#13;
the approach taken in this paper. Farm household models were developed&#13;
which explicitly recognize the cultural, technical, market and resource&#13;
constraints facing farm families.&#13;
The production and consumption choices of typical farm households&#13;
are modeled using mathematical programming methods. The effects of family&#13;
wealth and household demography on these choices are studied by varying the&#13;
model parameters characterizing household resource endowment and solving&#13;
for the optimal choices. In this way, the response to agricultural price&#13;
policy of a wide range of household types can be analyzed.&#13;
The models for the northeast simulate the resource allocation&#13;
choices of a single farm household which determine the production and&#13;
disposition of four crops, six livestock commodities, four non-agricultural&#13;
on-farm production activities and off-farm employment. Price and income&#13;
dependent consumption choices with respect to the main food grain, gluti-&#13;
nous rice, are also simulated. The models for the upper north are similar&#13;
except that eight crops, and seven non-agricultural on-farm production&#13;
activities are included in the choice set. Exogenous resource limitations&#13;
are imposed on land endowment by type, family labor by type, and dry season&#13;
irrigation water supplies (where applicable). The models maximize an&#13;
objective function, which is farm income less a risk premium term. The&#13;
risk term essentially linearizes a non-linear mean-standard deviation of&#13;
income trade-off surface. Moreover, farm income enters into the linear&#13;
family consumption constraints, and it can be shown that this formulation&#13;
is equivalent to maximizing a non-linear utility or weighting function that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
places emphasis on meeting minimum family consumption needs. However,&#13;
these needs may be met by either farm production or purchase. Crop and&#13;
livestock production are integrated, with livestock providing endogenous&#13;
buffalo draft power supplies to cropping activities and cropping providing&#13;
endogenous fodder supplies to livestock activities. Tractor draft power is&#13;
also available via a purchase activity.&#13;
The labor allocation decisions of the farm household are&#13;
important to family welfare and these are modeled in considerable detail.&#13;
In particular, household labor endownment is disaggregated into male,&#13;
female and child components. The specification of technology assigns&#13;
well-defined tasks to specific labor types, although substitution between&#13;
female and child labor is permitted for some tasks. The non-substitut-&#13;
ability of labor types in other tasks is in accord with the cultural norms&#13;
of rural Thailand. In analyzing the household employment opportunities&#13;
outside of on-farm agricultural activities, it is important to recognize&#13;
that these are not infinitely elastic. Rather the local markets for off-&#13;
farm labor services and on-farm non-agricultural production are quite&#13;
limited, and access to more distant markets can be had only with decreasing&#13;
net returns. This is modeled by introducing downward sloping demand step&#13;
functions for these activities. In this fashion, marginal returns are&#13;
endogenized.&#13;
Another element of structure corresponding to regional environ-&#13;
ment is the disaggregation of land endowment into land types and the char-&#13;
acterization of cropping technology as specific to land types. This intro-&#13;
duces constraints on crop substitution possibilities that reflect existing&#13;
rural conditions--e.g., cassava cannot be grown on bunded paddy land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
B. Parameter Estimation and Model Validation&#13;
Parameter estimates for the models were obtained almost entirely&#13;
from published sources. The relative richness of published studies and&#13;
government statistical sources in Thailand made this approach feasible. Of&#13;
the government sources, the agricultural census (1978), socio-economic&#13;
survey (1976), land utilization survey (1981) and soil survey maps (of the&#13;
Land Development Department) were particularly useful.&#13;
Of the published studies, those of the Rural Off-Farm Employment&#13;
Assessment Project (Kasetsart University), particularly the models of&#13;
R. Jaissard and S. Priebprom, the Agroecosystems Study of the Northeast&#13;
(Khon Kaen University), and the Multi-Cropping Project of the Upper North&#13;
(Chiang Mai Univesity), particularly the studies by A. Thodey, M. Seetisarn&#13;
and B. Rerkasem, were most helpful.&#13;
The models for the Northeast and Upper North were validated by&#13;
testing the replication of income and production data with tabulations for&#13;
representative households from the 1976 Socio-Economic Survey of the&#13;
National Statistical Office. The tabulations for model validation were&#13;
taken from the analysis of that survey by Meesook and Porter. The results&#13;
from the validation experiments are presented in Table 2. Note the close&#13;
correspondence of model results with the benchmark data from the 1975-76&#13;
SES in most instances. An exception is the income data for the Northeast,&#13;
where model estimates are somewhat higher. However, the estimates of total&#13;
household consumption derived from the same survey (shown on the line&#13;
directly below total income) show that consumption significantly exceeds&#13;
total income for the average of all farms in both the upper and lower&#13;
Northeast. It is so very improbable that farmers as a whole over the&#13;
&#13;

region would dissave (in a fairly normal year) that the likelihood of a&#13;
downward bias in the income estimates is quite high.    If the consumption&#13;
estimates are accepted as best estimates of the incomes of farm households&#13;
in the Northeast, then simulated farm household incomes from model&#13;
experiments are quite close. Thus, model validation results closely&#13;
simulate the performance of farm households in the Northeast and Upper&#13;
North, and model results from hypothetical "what if?" experiments can be&#13;
used with considerable confidence. Complete specifications of the models,&#13;
including parameter estimates, utilizing the format of the Generalized&#13;
Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) are presented in Appendices B and C.&#13;
C. Analyzing the Effects of Farm Size and Family Demographics&#13;
The principal resources allocated by the Thai farm household in&#13;
realizing its productive opportunities are labor and land. It follows that&#13;
the household endowments of labor and land are important determinants of&#13;
its welfare, and the impact of government policies employing economic&#13;
instruments such as prices, taxes and subsidies on individual households&#13;
will be heavily conditioned by that endowment of labor and land. The main&#13;
objective of the present investigation is to systematically study the&#13;
effects of household endowments of land and labor on family welfare and&#13;
agricultural supply response.&#13;
The experimental strategy for this investigation is straight-&#13;
forward: the model parameters characterizing household endownments are&#13;
systematically varied to cover the range of interesting cases and the&#13;
effects of rice price policy are simulated for each of these cases in a&#13;
sequence of experiments. To provide some sense of the range of variation&#13;
in endowments, the distribution of farm sizes and associated mean labor&#13;

endowments for each region are presented in Table 3.     Note that 90 percent&#13;
of the farms in the Upper North are less than 20 rai (3.2 hectares) in size&#13;
and 90 percent of the farms in the Northeast are less than 50 rai (8 ha.)&#13;
in size. Thus, both regions are overwhelmingly populated by smallholding&#13;
farmers. Both mean number of working persons and family size increase with&#13;
farm size. While demographic characteristics do not seem to vary&#13;
significantly by Province (Changwat), land forms and soil quality do vary&#13;
significantly across provinces, as does the availability of irrigation&#13;
water. In order to capture the effects of the land quality variable across&#13;
a region, the endowments of these variables were estimated by province&#13;
using soil survey maps and data from the Agricultural Census (1978) and&#13;
Land Utilization Survey (1981). Data on farm size distributions could not&#13;
be broken down by land type; and therefore, the proportional endowment by&#13;
land types was assumed to hold for all farm sizes in Changwat. The&#13;
proportional distribution of land types is given for the Changwats of the&#13;
Northeast and Upper North in Table 4. Not all Changwats in the Northeast&#13;
were included because of gaps in the soil survey mapping. However, the set&#13;
of included Changwats account for 40 percent of cultivated land and are&#13;
sufficiently varied in endowment to be representative for the region as a&#13;
whole.&#13;
In order to keep the number of simulation experiments within&#13;
reasonable bounds, the number of variants in farm size and labor endowment&#13;
were each set at three. Given five changwat classes in the Northeast and&#13;
six in the Upper North (including regional aggregate models) and seven&#13;
price variations, a total of 693 experiments were performed.     The parameter&#13;

the Northeast and Upper North are given in Tables 5 and 6 respectively.&#13;
The labor endowment can be derived from the population estimates for each&#13;
household type by assuming that all adults and children aged 7 to 13 are in&#13;
the labor force. However, women and children are available only 75 percent&#13;
of the time (180 hours per month), and only adults can take off-farm&#13;
employment. The basic wage that enters into the labor demand step&#13;
functions also varies by sex and month of the year. All of these labor&#13;
supply and demand assumptions are considered reasonable approximations to&#13;
conditions in rural Thailand.&#13;
IV. Results from the Simulation Experiments&#13;
Sequences of experiments systematically varying the farmgate&#13;
price of rice were performed for household endowments as specified in&#13;
Tables 5 and 6 for the provinces (changwats) listed in Table 7 and for&#13;
households with land endowments and farm sizes representing aggregates for&#13;
each region. Since the land type endowments for several changwats in each&#13;
region were markedly similar, the experiments for these provinces were&#13;
combined. Even so, the resulting number of experiments was so large&#13;
(almost 700) that detailed presentation of results is impractical.&#13;
Moreover, it turns out that the qualitative nature of the solutions for the&#13;
changwats of each region are sufficiently similar to make a detailed&#13;
comparison of individual changwats of lesser interest as compared with the&#13;
aggregative results for each region. For this reason only summary results&#13;
for the regions will be discussed here, although tables providing detailed&#13;
results by changwat are presented in Appendix A.&#13;

A. Welfare Effects of Variation in Price of Rice on Selected Farm&#13;
Households&#13;
It is well known that the welfare impact of discrete policy&#13;
actions present conceptual and measurement problems for the following&#13;
reasons: (i) Welfare is measured in subjective (utility) terms and varies&#13;
with real income. (ii) When accounting for labor time, subjective&#13;
magnitudes such as the utility of leisure and disutility of labor affect&#13;
the level of welfare. (iii) Accurate assessment of change in welfare&#13;

and Household Size Were Performed&#13;

requires taking into account all relevant repercussions from the rest of&#13;
the economy. In order to make welfare assertions, these issues must be&#13;
confronted. With respect to the subjective valuation of consumption, the&#13;
models already assume a Stone-Geary utility function, where the committed&#13;
consumption quantities represent subsistence minima. This function yields&#13;
the demand functions of the linear expenditure system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
This system has been used successfully in a large volume of&#13;
empirical work on demand. With respect to labor input, it is assumed that&#13;
the marginal rate of substitution between leisure and work is constant over&#13;
the relevant range, which eliminates anomalous subjective responses. This&#13;
is certainly, an innocuous assumption for peasant agriculture.    Since the&#13;
models deal with relative prices and comparative statical equilibria, the&#13;
only important macroeconomic feedback comes by means of the wage for&#13;
labor. However, section IIA introduced evidence suggesting that the real&#13;
wage for unskilled labor in Thailand is invariant to the price of rice,&#13;
given time for labor reallocation, and this assumption will be made in&#13;
analyzing the welfare impact of changes in the price of rice.&#13;
i) Effect on Farm Households in the Northeast&#13;
Figures 1 to 3 plot nominal household income by farm and house-&#13;
hold size. Note that the increase in income with change in the price of&#13;
rice is linear on small farms and the slopes are less than the slopes of&#13;
the income curves for medium and large farms, with the exception of small&#13;
families on large farms. This result is largely due to the lower propor-&#13;
tion of family income that small farmers can generate from cropping.&#13;
However, Figures 1 to 3 display data on nominal incomes, while it is real&#13;
income that is relevant to welfare comparisons. There are only two prices&#13;
for consumption goods that may change in each sequence of price variations&#13;
-- the price of rice and possibly the opportunity cost of labor for off-&#13;
farm employment. However, the analysis is conducted on the maintained&#13;
hypothesis that the real wage is invariant to the price of rice, which&#13;
leaves only that one price varying between experiments. Moreover, the&#13;
maintained hypothesis of consumer demands that follow the linear expendi-&#13;

ture system implies that changes in the demand for rice do not spillover&#13;
into other commodity markets. This assumption of constant marginal budget&#13;
shares is strong, but it can be regarded as a reasonable first&#13;
approximation.&#13;
Given the maintained hypotheses, it is relatively easy to&#13;
calculate Laspeyres and Paasche price indices that will in most instances&#13;
clearly establish the direction of the change in household welfare. This&#13;
comparison was done for the changes derived from the 63 experiments for the&#13;
aggregate northeast models and the results are shown in Table 8. Results&#13;
from similar calculations for each of the several northeast changwat models&#13;
are shown in Appendix A, Tables A-1 to A-4. Note that the price variations&#13;
are expressed in percentage changes from a base price -- i.e., -60, -40,&#13;
-20, 20, 40, and 60 percent. The base is the average farmgate price for&#13;
the years 1975 through 1978. An average was selected as the base because&#13;
significant annual variation left in doubt which particular year was most&#13;
representative. The particular years chosen were selected to match with the&#13;
data from the 1975-76 Socio-Economic Survey, which was the basis of model&#13;
calibration. The reader should note, however, that model results refer to&#13;
relative prices. Thus, a shift to the absolute prices of the 1980s is&#13;
meaningless for purposes of comparison. Only a shift to the relative&#13;
prices of the 1980s would permit intertemporal comparisons of actual&#13;
welfare shifts.&#13;

Turning to Table 8, the results are clearcut. In all cases,&#13;
small farmers are worse off. In almost all cases, large farmers are better&#13;
off. For medium sized farms, low and median sized families are better&#13;
off. As we shall see, the reason for this pattern of welfare changes is&#13;
quite simple -- farm households which are net purchasers of rice are worse&#13;
off, and farm households which are net sellers of rice are better off.&#13;
Thus, for medium sized farms, low and median sized families are net&#13;
sellers, while large families are net purchasers.&#13;
ii) Effect on Farm Households in the Upper North&#13;
Figures 4 to 6 plot nominal household income by farm and&#13;
household size. Clearly the rates of increase in income (i.e., slopes) are&#13;
greater for medium than small farms and for large farms than for medium&#13;
farms, reflecting the more limited income possibilities from cropping as&#13;
farm size decreases. As before, calculation of Laspeyres and Paasche price&#13;
indices permits a clear indication of the direction of change in real&#13;
income in most instances. The set of welfare changes derived from the 63&#13;
experiments for the aggregate upper north models are shown in Table 9.&#13;
Results from similar calculations for each of the several upper north&#13;
changwat models are shown in Appendix A, Tables A-5 to A-8.&#13;
The results in Table 9 are more varied, reflecting the increased&#13;
opportunities for profitable resource reallocation in the upper north, but&#13;
basically similar to those for the northeast shown in Table 8. Thus, low&#13;
sized families on small farms can become net sellers of rice over some&#13;
price intervals in some changwats, while median and large sized families&#13;

remain net purchasers and this circumstance explains the pattern of welfare&#13;
changes for small farms. A significant difference between the results for&#13;
the northeast and the upper north is that for the lowest price interval&#13;
(from -60 percent to -40 percent of base price) the welfare change is nega-&#13;
tive for all farm and family sizes in the upper north. The reason for this&#13;
difference is that in the upper north, at such low prices, rice cannot&#13;
compete effectively with an alternative crop, soybeans, for scarce resour-&#13;
ces, and all households become net purchasers of rice. The reason this does&#13;
not occur in the northeast is differences in land endowment, particularly&#13;
with respect to irrigation capacity. The shift to a welfare loss over the&#13;
(40,60) price interval for medium sized farms is caused in several chang-&#13;
wats by shifts in cropping pattern forced by the need to use scarce irriga-&#13;
tion water on a glutinous rice crop to meet family consumption needs at the&#13;
sacrifice of a profitable garlic crop. In other changwats (with very&#13;
limited irrigation capacity), such families become net purchasers in spite&#13;
of cropping pattern shifts.&#13;
The reader will recall that the welfare impacts were calculated&#13;
on the assumption that the nominal wage in each region remained the same.&#13;
This assumption is reasonable for short run impact, since the immediate&#13;
effect of the rice price increase is to lower the real wage for unskilled&#13;
labor in the non-agricultural sector, inducing a decrease in labor transfer&#13;
from the agricultural sector. The resulting increase in agricultural labor&#13;
supply should more or less offset the immediate increase in labor demand.&#13;
However, the evidence suggests that the non-agricultural real wage for&#13;
unskilled labor is invariant to the nominal price of rice, given time for&#13;
adjustment in labor markets. Thus, the non-agricultural nominal wage will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-37-&#13;
adjust upward in response to diminished agricultural labor transfers until&#13;
the real wage is restored to its original level. The close linkage of the&#13;
two labor markets will transmit the nominal wage adjustment, via changes in&#13;
labor transfers, to the rural labor market, inducing an increase in the&#13;
nominal wage sufficient to restore the former incentive to migration, i.e.,&#13;
the nominal wage in agriculture increases until the real wage reaches its&#13;
original level. If the prices for non-agricultural goods produced on-farm&#13;
rise proportionately to the increase in incomes due to increases in&#13;
agricultural and wage income (i.e., average income elasticity of unity),&#13;
_/ then given time for adjustment the short run negative impact on welfare&#13;
due to a rice price increase for net rice purchasing households should be&#13;
eliminated. Therefore, the evidence on welfare effects may be summarized&#13;
as follows: Using weights derived from Table 3, approximately 40 percent of&#13;
farm households in both the northeast and upper north would suffer a short&#13;
run welfare loss due to an increase in the price of rice. However, given&#13;
time for labor markets to fully adjust, the welfare loss is likely to be&#13;
reduced to something close to zero.&#13;
B. Supply Response to Rice Price Variation of Selected Farm Households&#13;
i. Farm Household Supply Response in the Northeast&#13;
Before presenting the estimates of supply elasticities, it will&#13;
be instructive to examine the variation of the rice balance with the rice&#13;
price for selected farm households in the northeast and upper north. This&#13;
balance, which neglects losses and annual stock carryovers is written&#13;
1/   In any event, given the diversity of these goods, the average income&#13;
elasticity will certainly be greater than one-half and probably close&#13;
to one. Thus a significant increase in demand and nominal prices can&#13;
be expected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38-&#13;
CONSUMPTION = PRODUCTION + PURCHASES - SALES&#13;
Figures 7 through 12 present plots of the rice balance variation&#13;
with rice prices for households on medium and large farms for the aggregate&#13;
northeast models. Similar balances for small farm households are not shown&#13;
since they are uninteresting -- production is always at the same maximal&#13;
level and consumption exceeds production at all prices. For low and median&#13;
sized families on medium sized farms, the plots show that production&#13;
increases significantly only over the two lowest price intervals. High&#13;
family sized households on large farms exhibit the same pattern. However,&#13;
low and median sized families on large farms display an erratic pattern of&#13;
production with significant increases over a number of price intervals.&#13;
Note that only low and median sized families on medium sized farms and all&#13;
households on large farms produce a marketed surplus at most prices.&#13;
The results on production response are most conveniently and&#13;
conventionally displayed as dimensionless elasticities. For present&#13;
purposes, elasticity of supply response is simply the ratio of percent&#13;
change in rice production to percent change in rice price. Elasticity&#13;
estimates were calculated as arc elasticities using results from the seven&#13;
price variation experiments for each of the selected household types. Arc&#13;
elasticity estimates over the six price intervals are shown for each of the&#13;
household types of the aggregate northeast models in Table 10. Similar&#13;
estimates for each of the changwat models for the northeast are given in&#13;
Appendix A, Tables A-10 to A-13. It will come as no surprise, after having&#13;
viewed the plots of rice balances, that medium sized farms have positive&#13;
elasticities only over the two lowest price intervals, and the supply&#13;
response of small farms is zero everywhere. Only low and median sized&#13;

families on large farms have positive elasticities over a significant range&#13;
of prices. Thus, a positive response is restricted to a small proportion&#13;
of farms except at low price levels. This pattern makes sense when the&#13;
context of the northeast is considered -- overwhelmingly rainfed farming,&#13;
with 70 percent of land in the wet season devoted to paddy, confronted with&#13;
a highly variable rainfall pattern that makes intensification very risky.&#13;
ii. Farm Household Supply Response in the Upper North&#13;
Figures 13 through 21 present plots of the rice balance variation&#13;
with rice prices for all households in the aggregate upper north models.&#13;
As Figures 13-15 show, small farms with low or median sized families&#13;
exhibit significant responses over several price intervals and the low&#13;
sized families even manage to produce a marketed surplus at higher prices.&#13;
This behavior, which sharply constrasts with that of small farmers in the&#13;
northeast, is a consequence of the richer set of production possibilities&#13;
that a significant irrigation capacity provides for farmers of the upper&#13;
north. Turning to the balances for households on medium sized farms&#13;
(Figures 16-18), all households produce at least some marketed surplus at&#13;
higher prices, and production response is usually significant, except over&#13;
the interval from base price to +40 percent. The plots for households on&#13;
large farms (Figures 19-21) indicate quite large marketed surplus except at&#13;
low prices. Here too, response is very weak over the base price to +40&#13;
percent interval. This common pattern in the upper north is due to the&#13;
limited substitution possibilities given the small set of discrete cropping&#13;
alternatives in the models. Substitution is almost nil over the base price&#13;
to +40 percent interval because increased rice production is not suffi-&#13;
ciently profitable to displace very profitable garlic production in the dry&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
season. When the rice price advances to 60 percent above base, substitu-&#13;
tion of rice for garlic occurs. In actual practice, given that many more&#13;
cropping alternatives exhibiting varying degrees of intensification of&#13;
cultivation are available to farmers than are included in the model, and&#13;
intensification is less risky under irrigation, supply response would be&#13;
more smooth and probably stronger.&#13;
Arc supply elasticity estimates over the six price intervals are&#13;
given for each of the household types of the aggregate upper north models&#13;
in Table 11. Similar estimates for each of the changwat models for the&#13;
upper north are given in Appendix A, Tables A-14 to A-18. As expected from&#13;
the rice balance plots, positive supply elasticities exist for all farm&#13;
household types over many intervals or price variation. Note, however, the&#13;
very limited response over the base price to +40 percent interval for all&#13;
farm households. As previously noted, this erratic pattern reflects the&#13;
limited set of discrete cropping choices in the model; and in actual&#13;
practice, the response would be smoother.&#13;
Now that the supply elasticity estimates for selected farm house-&#13;
holds in both regions have been examined, some interest attaches to the&#13;
calculation of overall elasticities for each region. This has been done,&#13;
using the proportionate area holdings for farm size classes given in Table&#13;
3 as weights (and interpolating when a size class was not modeled) and&#13;
weights of .2, .6, and .2 for low, median and high sized families respec-&#13;
tively. The results from this calculation are given in Table 12. As noted&#13;
previously, the erratic variation of the elasticity estimates is to some&#13;
extent an artifact of model construction, and actual supply response can be&#13;
expected to be somewhat smoother. Thus, for the northeast, an average&#13;

Summary&#13;
The evidence from the simulation experiments clearly supports the&#13;
view that rice policy is a two-edged sword. High export taxes suppress&#13;
production response, but transfer surplus to government and non-agriculture&#13;
employers where it can be used for developmental objectives. From this&#13;
viewpoint, Thai policy should be given high marks for a good performance&#13;
since it has tended to keep prices above the range of serious production&#13;
losses (i.e., high supply elasticities) and permitted significant transfer&#13;
of surplus over several decades for developmental purposes, while the&#13;
availability of unutilized land kept the heavy taxation from drying up the&#13;
exportable rice surplus. However, the era of expansion of area cultivated&#13;
is drawing to a close, and decades of taxation have suppressed the&#13;
intensification of Thai agriculture. Thus, it seems clear that marked&#13;
policy shifts will be required to adjust to changed resource&#13;
availabilities.&#13;
The rather sketchy evidence on macroeconomic adjustment to&#13;
changes in the price of rice suggests that the real wage is invariant to&#13;
the price of rice. Thus, changes in the price of rice have almost no&#13;
effect on both the rural and urban poor in the longer run. This find is&#13;
reinforced by application of Ricardian rent theory. Since a large&#13;
proportion of the existing cultivable land is specialized to rice by&#13;
factors such as topography, natural water flows, past investments and&#13;
demand, and given a termination to the possibility of significant expansion&#13;
of the cultivated area, the principal impact of change in the price of rice&#13;
should fall upon the rents from rice producing land. In fact, the export&#13;
taxation of rice can be regarded as essentially a transfer from rural&#13;
landowners to urban employers and the government.&#13;

            The supply and welfare effects of
            rice-pricing policy in Thailand
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The impact of dropping taxation of rice
            exports in Thailand on family welfare and rice production is
            analyzed in this paper. Models of household production and
            consumption decisions are used in the analysis of selected
            farm households in the Northeast and Upper North regions of
            the country. The objective is to assess the effects of
            variation in land quality, farm and family size on welfare
            and on supply response to rice tax policy. The analysis
            specified three farm sizes and three family sizes, through
            these differed between regions, with land quality remaining
            a regional variable.
