ADJUSTMENT IN LOW-INCOME AFRICA, 1974-78&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report 1981&#13;
"External shocks" (mainly adverse terms of trade movements and slower&#13;
world trade growth) in 1974-78 contributed to the slowdown in growth experienced&#13;
by low- and middle-income oil-importing African countries. But other "internal"&#13;
shocks also contributed, as did structural constraints and weak economic manage-&#13;
ment. Moreover, several countries experienced favorable terms of trade movements&#13;
during that period, and aid generally increased. The experience of four countries&#13;
-- Kenya, Tanzania, Senegal, and Sudan -- illustrates some aspects of managing&#13;
adjustment to external shocks: successful short-term demand management did not&#13;
necessarily lead to increased production; over-ambitious investment programs were&#13;
defended at the expense of ongoing operations; foreign exchange was misallocated;&#13;
and agricultural exports were neglected&#13;

Preface&#13;
This paper, prepared as background to the World Development Report&#13;
1981 (New York: Oxford University Press, August 1981), examines the macro-&#13;
economic effects of the "external shocks" of the mid-1970s on low-income&#13;
African countries and the responses of these countries to such shocks.&#13;
Since the per capita income borderline between low- and middle-income&#13;
countries (US$370 in 1979) is essentially arbitrary, the discussion also&#13;
includes middle-income African countries near that borderline that are&#13;
similar in structure to the low-income countries.&#13;
Even more caution than usual is needed when interpreting the data&#13;
available for these countries. In particular, it has not been possible to&#13;
resolve occasional inconsistencies between the data presented in Part III of&#13;
the paper, which have been assembled by the World Bank's Economic Analysis&#13;
and Projections Department for purposes of global and comparative analysis,&#13;
with those presented in Part IV, which have been used by the Bank s country&#13;
economists for more in-depth analysis.&#13;
At the time this paper was prepared, the Bank's comparative data&#13;
had only been up-dated to 1978. This therefore became the cut-off point for&#13;
analysis. Since 1978, however, the second oil shock and the recession in&#13;
industrial countries have resulted in sharp terms-of-trade declines for most&#13;
African countries and have greatly complicated their efforts to achieve&#13;
longer-term adjustment. The comparatively benign external environment of the&#13;
period examined in the paper, 1974-78, has certainly since deteriorated.&#13;
This paper draws on several country economic reports prepared in the&#13;
World Bank; it also draws on short country case studies and notes prepared by&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
I. Introduction&#13;
The difficulties of the low-income African countries 1/ have become&#13;
the subject of serious concern over the past few years. The first three World&#13;
Development Reports commented on the low rates of growth of income and output&#13;
and the continuing low living standard of these countries. World Development&#13;
Report, 1980 commented (p. 11) that "these countries face a desperately hard&#13;
adjustment period coming on top of the economic stagnation of the 1970s....&#13;
The plight of these poor Asian and African countries, particularly the latter,&#13;
deserves special attention from the international community." Similarly, the&#13;
Brandt Report (Independent Commission on International Development Issues,&#13;
North-South: A Programme for Survival; London: Pan Books, 1980) devoted&#13;
particular attention to the "poverty belt" extending across the middle of Africa&#13;
from the Sahara in the north to Lake Nyasa in the south. Such concern is&#13;
evident in Africa also: the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has proposed a&#13;
program for development in Africa (the Lagos Plan), and the African governors of&#13;
the World Bank have called for a report from the World Bank on development needs&#13;
in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank, Accelerated Development in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa: An Agenda for Action; Washington, D.C., 1981), on the basis of which&#13;
they hope that international support can be mobilized.&#13;
In 1979 the population of twenty-four low-income African countries 2/&#13;
was about 187 million (4.4 percent of the world's population), while the eleven&#13;
1/   The ensuing discussion, though primarily focussed on low-income African&#13;
oil importers, also relates to "lower middle-income" African oil importers&#13;
(region 3 of the World Bank-s global model).&#13;
2/ Low-income countries are those with 1979 GNP per capita of US$370 or less.&#13;
They include Chad, Ethiopia, Somalia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Burundi,&#13;
Upper Volta, Malawi, Rwanda, Benin, The Gambia, Mozambique, Sierra Leone,&#13;
Tanzania, Zaire, Niger, Guinea, Central African Republic, Madagascar,&#13;
Uganda, Mauritania, Lesotho, Togo, and Sudan. Excluded are countries with&#13;
less than one-half million people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
middle-income oil-importing African countries 1/ accounted for some 65 million&#13;
(1.5 percent of the world total). The two groups together comprise less than&#13;
half the population of India, yet poverty is as seriously entrenched; in 1978,&#13;
average income per capita in low-income Africa was 13 percent of the world&#13;
average (25 percent for middle-income oil-importing Africa). The "basic needs"&#13;
indicators for low- and middle-income Africa lag seriously behind those of the&#13;
rest of the world. Most seriously, GNP per person probably did not grow during&#13;
the 1970s.&#13;
This paper analyzes some aspects of adjustment to external "shocks"&#13;
by low-income African countries during the 1970s, and in particular during the&#13;
period following the first oil price increase, 1974-78. "Successful" adjust-&#13;
ment is to be understood as the reduction of a current account deficit caused&#13;
by an external shock to a sustainable level while maintaining the momentum of&#13;
development. Adjustment so defined has both short- and long-term aspects.&#13;
An externally induced deficit can either be financed by increased borrowing,&#13;
which implies increased foreign exchange earning in the long term, or by&#13;
increased concessional assistance, which may not be dependable over a long&#13;
periods or which may carry a political price tag. Alternatively, a deficit&#13;
can be reduced by increased production of tradeable goods (exports or import&#13;
substitution) or by reductions in the level and rate of growth of domestic,&#13;
and hence import, demand. A sharp, sudden reduction in domestic demand may&#13;
bring about short-term balance-of-payments equilibrium, but if it is at the&#13;
cost of investment, the creation of excess capacity, or a lack of inputs,&#13;
1/ Kenya, Ghana, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Liberia, Zambia, Cameroon, Swaziland,&#13;
Botswana, Mauritius, and Ivory Coast, excluding those countries with less&#13;
than one-half million people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

spares, etc. needed to maintain important infrastructure, then longer-term&#13;
efforts to restore growth and development may be jeopardized. For very poor&#13;
countries, such a sharp curtailment of domestic demand must either involve&#13;
the sacrifice of already depressed consumption levels or the curtailment of&#13;
investment needed for long-term growth. Equally, a smooth "easy" short-term&#13;
adjustment (probably one financed by external capital) may not facilitate&#13;
longer-term development if needed changes in the economic structure are not&#13;
then planned for and set in motion.&#13;
The "adjustment" focus in this paper generates two sorts of artifi-&#13;
ciality. The first is the distinction between "adjustment" and "development"&#13;
in general. This distinction is a difficult one to work into a discussion of&#13;
low-income African countries, since, by comparison with other developing&#13;
countries, these include large non-monetized sectors which are not well inte-&#13;
grated with either the small domestic modern sector or with the international&#13;
economy. These sectors have their own internal dynamic, reflecting long-term&#13;
demographic and resource-endowment patterns. There is, moreover, a sense in&#13;
which development in general must mean that the capacity to adjust to external&#13;
"shocks" (changes in the supply/demand outlook for key traded commodities,&#13;
changes in the institutional environment for developing countries, etc.)&#13;
increases. Perhaps more developed countries are by definition those better&#13;
able to adjust to external shocks. But, although there may well be such a&#13;
link, there is obviously no one-for-one relationship -- there are more deve-&#13;
loped countries (Turkey, Brazil) that have not adjusted as well as one might&#13;
have expected given their level of development, and there are less developed&#13;
countries that have adjusted better.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
Second, the focus on the events of circa 1974, and principally the&#13;
oil price increase, might appear to take a particular event in recent economic&#13;
history out of context. As we shall see, other "shocks" (drought, abrupt&#13;
shifts in domestic policy, etc.) were equally, if not more, important for some&#13;
countries. In terms of the trade environment of the low-income countries, the&#13;
oil price increase of those years both arose out of and gave rise to ongoing&#13;
changes in manufacturing and other prices. Moreover, it coincided with other&#13;
developments in the low-income African countries -- not necessarily sudden&#13;
shocks, but the working through of some longer-term factors (for example,&#13;
diminishing returns to existing agricultural technology, an inappropriate and&#13;
costly industrial structure nurtured by biases in the protective system).&#13;
Nevertheless, if such external shocks are to become more frequent,&#13;
it is important to understand their implications. Appropriate patterns of&#13;
response to the oil shock of 1979-81 and possible future shocks may perhaps be&#13;
revealed by examination of the earlier one.&#13;
This paper presents a macroeconomic examination of adjustment to&#13;
such external shocks in low-income Africa using country case material for&#13;
Kenya, Tanzania, Senegal, and Sudan. Before examining these cases (in Section&#13;
IV), however, some structural features of low-income Africa are reviewed&#13;
(Section II), and an account of the external shocks as they affected low-&#13;
income and middle-income African countries as a group is presented (Section&#13;
III). These two sections will enable us to place the case studies in per-&#13;
spective. Section V draws conclusions.&#13;

II. Low-Income Africa: Some Structural Features&#13;
The low-income countries of Africa are very diverse in size, physical&#13;
location (many of them are landlocked), and history. Ilowever, there are several&#13;
common elements. Most of the work force, and generally about half of production,&#13;
is in the agricultural sector. Exports, which usually correspond to a large&#13;
proportion of production in these countries, consist of non-fuel primary&#13;
commodities for which demand is growing slowly and whose prices fluctuate&#13;
substantially. The population growth rate in most low-income African countries&#13;
is still increasing, and in most of them exceeds 2.5 percent a year, largely a&#13;
result of improvements in health and education conditions that are both reducing&#13;
mortality and increasing fertility. Physical infrastructure is in general still&#13;
poorly developed, although significant investments have been made over the&#13;
last 15 to 20 years. Most countries in the region became independent only in&#13;
the 1960s and inherited acute deficiencies in skills, institutions, and general&#13;
education. These deficiencies have limited the impact of investment, and&#13;
especially external assistance, on growth. 1/&#13;
Although many African countries have now been independent for more&#13;
than 20 years, many aspects of the colonial heritage still loom large: the&#13;
many small, very open economies; some mineral enclave economies (like Guinea&#13;
and Zambia); but perhaps most importantly, a very limited entrepreneurial&#13;
heritage, a recent concept of nationhood, and an interventionist state. This&#13;
last aspect has continued to be of importance in the post-colonial period, as&#13;
the fulfillment of the expectations associated with the rise of nationalism&#13;
1/ See World Development Reports 1979 and 1980. See also John Lewis, "Report&#13;
of the Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee, 1980," and&#13;
Shankar Acharya, "Perspectives and Problems of Development in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa," World Bank Staff Working Paper No. 300, 1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
placed an ever-expanding list of demands at the doors of governments -- for&#13;
better education and health, for more employment (especially of the expanding&#13;
numbers of school leavers), for cheap food and other essentials. In addition,&#13;
many African countries have, over the past 20 years, suffered from serious&#13;
political instability and conflict; troubles in Southern Africa, the Horn of&#13;
Africa, Chad, and between Tanzania and Uganda (the war of 1978) are recent, but&#13;
not unique, examples.&#13;
Compared with other low-income countries (Table 1), African countries&#13;
have, on average, lower literacy and life expectancy, are more agricultural and&#13;
less industrialized, and invest and save less of their income. Per capita&#13;
income growth has lagged seriously. GNP per person, having grown 1.7 percent&#13;
a year during the period 1960-70, is estimated to have fallen by 0.4 percent&#13;
a year during the period 1970-80. 1/ For the middle-income African countries,&#13;
the story is only slightly better: GNP per person grew by 1.7 percent from&#13;
1960-70 and by 0.4 percent from 1970-80.&#13;
A related general trend of the 1970s has been the poor performance&#13;
of exports. Export performance (Table 2) has deteriorated in both low- and&#13;
middle-income oil-importing Africa, and over all broad commodity groups.&#13;
In addition to the poor agricultural performance alluded to earlier, it reflects&#13;
the particular difficulties of the large mineral producers (Zambia, Zaire,&#13;
Guinea). The fall in exports, combined with falling terms of trade 1970-79 in&#13;
the case of low-income Africa (Table 1), but partially offset by rising external&#13;
assistance (see Table 9), caused an average fall in the volume of imports during&#13;
1/   The poor quality of the basic data for Africa generally should be strongly&#13;
emphasized.&#13;

the 1970s of 0.5 percent a year. In middle-income oil-importing Africa, imports&#13;
grew only slowly (2.3 percent a year), and many of these countries only sustained&#13;
this import growth through heavy borrowing on the Eurodollar market with consequent&#13;
financial strains at the end of the 1970s. 1/ These trends -- slow-growing or&#13;
falling production levels, stagnant exports -- were becoming evident before the&#13;
external shocks of the mid-1970s.&#13;
1/   Examples are Sudan, Zaire, Zambia, Mauritius, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Togo,&#13;
and P.R. Congo.&#13;

III. The External Shocks of the 1970s&#13;
The principal "external shocks" of the mid-1970s related to trade,&#13;
particularly the sharp terms-of-trade deterioration during 1973-75 (of which the&#13;
oil price increase was one important component) and a slowdown in the growth of&#13;
world trade. The effect of these on oil-importing African countries as a group&#13;
is considered briefly below.&#13;
Terms-of-trade developments&#13;
Most African countries experienced a decline in their terms of trade&#13;
during 1975 (see Table 3). This reflected both the rise in import prices (oil&#13;
and manufactured goods), which affected most African countries slightly later&#13;
than it did countries outside the region, and a fall in export prices. However,&#13;
the following two years saw an improvement for several countries as the rate of&#13;
increase in impart prices (especially for capital goods and oil) slackened off&#13;
and the primary product prices improved. African countries have been vulnerable&#13;
to a "boom and bust" commodity price cycle, which has rendered economic management&#13;
difficult even when the trend in export prices has not been unfavorable. For&#13;
several countries, however, the trend has not been favorable either.&#13;
Coffee, cotton, and cocoa constitute major shares of exports for eleven,&#13;
seven, and six countries, respectively (see Table 4). Coffee, cocoa, tea, and&#13;
bauxite prices peaked in 1977. Most other major export commodities, especially&#13;
food products, had their price peaks in the early 1970s. Some middle-income&#13;
countries (Ivory Coast and Cameroon, for example) have a more diversified range&#13;
of exports and can therefore more easily withstand adverse price developments&#13;
for any single export. The low-income countries appear to be more monocultural.&#13;

Fuel imports&#13;
For most African countries, the fuel price increases of 1973/74 led&#13;
to substantially higher ratios of fuel imports to exports values for most&#13;
African countries (see Table 5). For both low- and middle-income oil importers,&#13;
the ratio of fuel import values to export values rose substantially from 1970&#13;
to 1975 but fell again in 1978 (see Table 6). The improvement was due partly&#13;
to the upswing in other commodity prices leading to better terms of trade, but&#13;
the volume of fuel imports also appears to have fallen. For neither of the&#13;
two groups of countries have oil price increases been a decisive factor in&#13;
their terms of trade (see Table 7). Terms-of-trade indices (base year =&#13;
1978) calculated with and without fuel imports have moved very similarly&#13;
through 1978. The share of exports devoted to fuel imports having increased&#13;
since the early 1970s, however, countries are now significantly-more vulnerable&#13;
to further such increases, and their terms of trade in future will be more&#13;
heavily dominated by the likely trend in oil prices.&#13;
Export market developments&#13;
A further aspect of the external environment for low-income Africa&#13;
during the 1970s was the slowdown in the growth of export markets. Although&#13;
this factor certainly played a role, low- and middle-income oil-importing&#13;
Africa's share in all oil-importing developing country exports decreased&#13;
steadily from 1965 to 1978 (see Table 8), and in virtually all the main export&#13;
categories. This view is confirmed by Balassa and Barsony 1/ who show that&#13;
for a group of least developed countries (most of them African), the adverse&#13;

effects on the resource gap of the fall in export market share outweighed the&#13;
effects of the contraction in export demand over the period 1974-78. The same&#13;
effect was noted, though to a smaller extent, for a group of agricultural&#13;
primary producer countries, also largely African.&#13;
The impact of external shocks&#13;
There is some relationship between terms-of-trade movements and GDP&#13;
growth.. As Table 3 indicates, most countries, both low- and middle-income,&#13;
that experienced terms-of-trade improvements over 1974-78 also experienced&#13;
improvements in their growth rates in 1975-78 compared with 1971-74, while&#13;
many that experienced terms-of-trade declines had lower growth rates. In&#13;
both cases there were exceptions. Most African countries, however, became&#13;
more dependent on external finance and drawdowns of reserves during the&#13;
1970s; Table 3 shows that the ratio of the current account deficit to GDP&#13;
rose in almost all cases (not only those experiencing adverse terms-of-trade&#13;
movements) from 1971-74 to 1975-78. For low-income African countries as a&#13;
group, the current account deficit (excluding official transfers) increased&#13;
from 4.1 percent of GDP in 1970 to 13.6 percent in 1974 and remained over&#13;
10 percent in 1978 (see Table 9). Middle-income countries current account&#13;
deficits also rose from 1.1 percent of GDP in 1970 to 7.3 percent in 1975 and&#13;
had even risen marginally (to 7.4 percent) by 1978.&#13;
There was some hardening of the terms on which these current&#13;
account deficits were financed. For the low-income countries (Table 9),&#13;
official transfers financed 60 percent of their combined current account&#13;
deficit and concessional loans a further 42 percent in 1970, thus permitting&#13;
an increase in foreign exchange reserves. By 1978, these two components of&#13;
official development assistance (ODA) only covered 53 percent of the combined&#13;

deficit, the balance being non-concessional loans and other capital. For&#13;
middle-income countries, the shift is even more dramatic: ODA financed 143&#13;
percent of their combined deficit in 1970, only 24 percent in 1978.&#13;
These changes may account for the perception among many other&#13;
recipients that the supply of aid has not responded adequately to their&#13;
needs. Looked at from another point of view, however, the picture is more&#13;
sanguine. In 1978 ODA accounted for higher levels of imports than it did in&#13;
1970 in both low- and middle-income countries. The value of ODA to low-income&#13;
countries increased by 18 percent a year on average in 1970-78, by 24 percent&#13;
a year to middle-income countries. This was greater than the increase in&#13;
average import prices (13 percent a year for both groups of countries in&#13;
1970-78).&#13;

IV. Country Experience&#13;
The adjustment experience of the low-income oil-importing African&#13;
countries can be illustrated by the experience of four such countries -- Kenya,&#13;
Tanzania, Senegal, and Sudan (see Table 1) -- during the mid-1970s. These&#13;
countries have not been chosen to reflect, nor could they be fully represen-&#13;
tative of, all low- and middle-income Africa. Rather, the purpose is to&#13;
illustrate some aspects of adjustment in countries which share a number of&#13;
important characteristics with the group of countries as a whole. As will&#13;
become clear from the analysis, Kenya and Senegal share the characteristic of&#13;
being extremely vulnerable to movements in the terms of trade. Tanzania and&#13;
Sudan, while also being vulnerable to terms-of-trade movements, have experienced&#13;
economic difficulties that relate at least in part to poor performance in their&#13;
productive sectors. Senegal and Sudan share the problem that growth (which was&#13;
in any case low in the case of Senegal) was maintained during the latter part&#13;
of the 1970s by recourse to external borrowing that generated a financial&#13;
crisis at the end of the decade. In Sudan's case this crisis was particularly&#13;
serious, though the "shock" was, if anything, positive. Kenya, though also&#13;
having faced significant economic difficulties toward the end of the decade,&#13;
had accumulated less external debt than the other two countries. Tanzania, by&#13;
contrast, was insufficiently creditworthy to attract significant lending on&#13;
commercial terms; instead, it became increasingly dependent on concessional&#13;
development assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Kenya&#13;
Economic developments before 1974&#13;
From independence in 1964 until the first oil price increase in&#13;
1973, Kenya's economy grew rapidly (6.6 percent a year), with little apparent&#13;
pressure on domestic prices or the foreign exchange position. The annual&#13;
domestic inflation rate averaged only 2 percent; domestic resource mobili-&#13;
zation was high, with domestic savings comprising 19-20 percent of GDP; both&#13;
agriculture and manufacturing grew rapidly (4.7 percent and 8.4 percent,&#13;
respectively). The expansion of agriculture was stimulated by redistribution&#13;
of large estates to smallholders, rapid diffusion of hybrid maize, and growth&#13;
of smallholder production. The expansion of domestic demand that resulted from&#13;
rising agricultural incomes made the growth of manufacturing possible, and&#13;
this was assisted on the supply side by a liberal attitude toward foreign&#13;
investment, active government promotion of and participation in manufacturing&#13;
ventures, and high levels of protection. Despite this rapid growth, Kenya&#13;
remained a poor country, heavily rural and dependent on agriculture. It&#13;
still has significant problems of poverty and under-employment, especially in&#13;
the rural areas. About one-fourth of the population is estimated to be&#13;
living in absolute poverty.&#13;
In 1973 Kenya faced two long-term problems. First, the population&#13;
growth rate (then about 3.5 percent a year) was giving rise to increasing&#13;
pressure on the limited arable land, on urban employment opportunities, and&#13;
on access to education and other public services that could improve income&#13;
distribution. Second, agricultural growth appeared to be losing its&#13;
momentum, and the pattern of industrialization was inward-looking, toward&#13;
the countries of the former East African Community (EAC) as well as Kenya&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
itself. The industrial sector had become excessively dependent on imports,&#13;
biased against exports, and capital-intensive. Efficiency of resource use&#13;
was declining, reflected in part in a rising incremental capital-output ratio&#13;
(ICOR). The growth rate was starting to decline.&#13;
The shocks of 1974-75&#13;
During 1974 Kenya's terms of trade deteriorated 12 percent. The&#13;
resulting loss in income was about 5 percent of real gross domestic income.&#13;
At the same time, the volume of exports fell by 5 percent, owing to drought,&#13;
and import volume rose 12 percent. The current account deficit thus reached&#13;
12.6 percent of GDP, compared with 6.9 percent in 1973 (see Table 10), financed&#13;
largely by increases in private capital inflows and drawings on International&#13;
Monetary Fund (IMF) facilities. Kenya was able to absorb these effects in 1974&#13;
without severe disruption, although GDP growth slowed to 2.6 percent in 1974&#13;
from 6.4 percent the previous year because of the comfortable foreign exchange&#13;
reserve position at the beginning of 1974 and the high levels of business&#13;
inventories.&#13;

Policy response&#13;
The prospect of continued deterioration in Kenya's external position,&#13;
primarily because of worsening terms of trade and slow export growth, prompted&#13;
the government to introduce a restructuring program. Broadly, this involved&#13;
restraining the consumption of both the public and private sectors and chaneling&#13;
investment to areas where the results would be quick and productive. Domestic&#13;
inflation was to be held below international levels so as to encourage the use&#13;
of domestic resources and to maintain Kenya's competitiveness in export markets.&#13;
The program relied mainly on the use of fiscal and monetary instruments.&#13;
To restrict consumption, taxes on income and sales taxes on luxury goods and&#13;
gasoline were raised. In the monetary field, interest rates were raised by about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
5 percentage points from less than 10 percent. This was accompanied by the&#13;
revision of the three-year forward budget to shift resources into exports,&#13;
agricultural production, and industries using more labor-intensive techniques.&#13;
Growth of both government consumption and of the development budget was to be&#13;
reduced from the Third Plan levels. To encourage exports, a 10 percent subsidy&#13;
on manufactured exports was introduced. In addition, Kenya's incomes policy&#13;
kept average annual wage increases to no more than 75 percent of the increase&#13;
in the cost of living, but with those at the bottom of the income scale receiving&#13;
full compensation for the cost of living increase. These measures and the&#13;
continuing world recession in 1974-75 led to a further slowdown in Kenya's&#13;
economic growth to 2.3 percent in 1975 and to a fall in total "formal sector"&#13;
wage employment. The current deficit, however, narrowed to 9.7 percent of GDP&#13;
in 1975.&#13;
The coffee boom of 1976-77&#13;
The years 1976 and 1977 witnessed a sharp turnaround in the country's&#13;
terms of trade following the 1976 frost in Brazil and the subsequent coffee&#13;
price boom. Kenya's economy rebounded as a result of the external stimulus&#13;
and grew at 5.6 and 8.6 percent, respectively, in 1976 and 1977. The current&#13;
account deficit also narrowed to 3.8 and 1.0 percent of GDP in those two&#13;
years..&#13;
With increased resource availability as the result of the 1976-77&#13;
coffee boom, the government adopted an expansionary budget in 1977/78 to&#13;
compensate for curtailment of development expenditure in the previous three&#13;
years. The public investment program was stepped up in part by increasing&#13;
expenditures needed to replace defunct East African Community corporations by&#13;
national entities. In addition, a program of military equipment purchases&#13;
began. As a result, the overall budget deficit rose from less than 5 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
of GDP in 1976/77 to an estimated 9 percent by 1978/79. By mid-1977, however,&#13;
coffee prices stabilized and began a gradual downturn. The expansionary impact&#13;
of relaxed fiscal and monetary policy caused the balance of payments situation&#13;
to deteriorate again in 1978, as the import bill increased by more than 40&#13;
percent and the terms of trade deteriorated, producing a current account deficit&#13;
equal to 16.3 percent of GDP. As a result Kenya had to draw down its reserves&#13;
and greatly increase its recourse to external borrowing, much of it on commercial&#13;
terms. The debt service ratio rose from 5 percent in 1972 to 11.2 percent in&#13;
1979.&#13;
In 1979 Kenya's economy performed poorly due to relatively low&#13;
prices for coffee and tea in world markets, further increases in prices of&#13;
crude petroleum, drought conditions, and the impact of credit restrictions&#13;
on imports.&#13;
Adjustment in Kenya&#13;
Kenya's economy is extremely vulnerable to terms-of-trade fluctua-&#13;
tions (Table 10), reflecting a relatively high ratio of exports and imports&#13;
to GDP (30 percent and 32 percent, respectively, in 1965-73). In 1974, the&#13;
brunt of the adverse terms-of-trade movement was borne by private consumption,&#13;
which fell 5.3 percent, while in 1975 and 1976 it was gross investment that&#13;
stagnated, despite the emphasis of the government's restructuring program on&#13;
restraining consumption (which did in fact expand more slowly than population).&#13;
The combination of tightened monetary and fiscal management and decelerating&#13;
import price increases reduced domestic inflation in 1975 (Table 10), but the&#13;
coffee boom subsequently reversed this improvement. Similarly, the balance&#13;
of payments current account improved in 1976, partly through a recovery in&#13;
export volume and the terms of trade, partly through the compression of imports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
As noted earlier, real wages fell at this time, but this reflected a&#13;
longer-term Kenyan government policy of wage restraint more than the short-&#13;
term impact of less favorable external circumstances. Perhaps more serious,&#13;
wage employment fell, especially in recession-prone industries such as&#13;
construction. But, on the whole, Kenya's adjustment to the first oil price&#13;
increase must be deemed successful in its restoring financial equilibrium in&#13;
the short term.&#13;
Longer-term adjustment was less successful. It will be recalled&#13;
that, even before the 1974 oil price shock, growth was starting to slacken,&#13;
and the pattern of industrialization appeared excessively inward-looking.&#13;
These problems were accentuated by the oil price shock. During the period of&#13;
the Third Plan (1972-78), imports and exports expanded more slowly than GDP,&#13;
and export growth was slower than import growth. Exports were in part&#13;
adversely affected by the once-for-all shift in the direction of trade away&#13;
from the former EAC partners and by the slow growth of demand for traditional&#13;
exports. But there appears to be more export growth potential, both in such&#13;
traditional exports as coffee and tea and in a diverse category of primary and&#13;
processed products. Kenya's exchange rate depreciated by 18 percent from&#13;
1972 to 1978 against a weighted average of oil import partners' exchange rates,&#13;
while over the same .period its consumer prices increased about 15 percent more.&#13;
Since 1975, when the terms of trade were at their lowest, the erosion of Kenya's&#13;
competitiveness, as given by price-adjusted exchange rate movements, has been&#13;
quite sharp. This loss of competitiveness left Kenya in a weak position to&#13;
respond to the 1978-79 surge in import prices, despite a devaluation of 12.4&#13;
percent in 1975. A further depreciation might well have been needed after 1975&#13;
if a faster growth of exports and import substitutes were desired.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
The bias of industrial policy toward import substitution has probably&#13;
increased, rather than reduced, the country's vulnerability to externally&#13;
induced fluctuations. Kenya has placed increasing reliance on import controls&#13;
and quantitative restrictions to save foreign exchange and encourage domestic&#13;
manufacturing production. The restrictive system has attempted to give priority&#13;
to essential consumer goods and investment-related goods. As a result, industrial&#13;
inputs have tended to become the marginal imports. The consequent shift in the&#13;
composition of imports from final to intermediate goods implies that policies&#13;
designed to restrict imports will have adverse effects on output and employment,&#13;
rather than just on consumption. The steady tightening of controls has increased&#13;
this bias in industrial and trade policy. 1/&#13;
Since Kenya's import growth after 1974 slowed down more than its&#13;
GDP growth, it might appear that import substitution was proceeding success-&#13;
fully. This, however, would be misleading. For the reasons indicated above,&#13;
the slowdown in import growth has started to affect inputs and raw material&#13;
supplies, and has therefore been achieved both at the cost of employment and&#13;
incomes and at some peril to the efficient operation of existing capacity.&#13;
A related phenomenon has been the growing imbalance in the government's own&#13;
expenditure between new capital spending and maintenance outlays. The result&#13;
has been that existing facilities are increasingly poorly maintained and&#13;
inefficiently operated.&#13;
1/ The system of industrial protection and the allocation of public expen-&#13;
diture have been the object of policy reforms started during 1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Kenya's experience during the late 1970s illustrates both the&#13;
achievements and the limitations of demand management policies. The Kenyan&#13;
government in 1975 and again in 1979 acted promptly to deflate the economy&#13;
after oil price increases. But it did not, at least in 1975, undertake&#13;
longer-term adjustment measures sufficient to restore the rapid growth rates&#13;
evident up to 1973, notably the correction of anti-trade biases, which would&#13;
help restructure production towards tradeable goods and hence maintain long-&#13;
term growth.&#13;
Tanzania&#13;
Economic developments before 1974&#13;
At independence in 1961, Tanzania (then Tanganyika) was one of the&#13;
poorest countries in the world, almost solely dependent on subsistence agri-&#13;
culture and a few estate crops, with a very small industrial base (less than&#13;
5 percent of GDP, and most of that small scale) and a very small number of&#13;
educated and trained personnel. With the Arusha Declaration of 1967, after a&#13;
period in which a conventional mixed-economy policy had been followed, the&#13;
government announced a radical shift in goals -- towards socialism, broadly&#13;
based rural development, self-reliance, development of an education system&#13;
geared to the entire population and refocused on the rural areas, and economic&#13;
growth. To accomplish these goals, the state, with guidance from the ruling&#13;
party, was to play the leading role, especially in the reform and creation of&#13;
appropriate institutions. This led in the late 1960s to the nationalization of&#13;
large-scale industry, commerce and finance; the creation of several new para-&#13;
statal bodies; the formation of "ujamaa" (cooperative) villages; the 1972&#13;
decentralization of government; and, in the mid-1970s, the mass campaign of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
"villagization." At the same time the cooperative system was abolished,&#13;
further disrupting the agricultural sector.&#13;
Given the major institutional changes during this period, Tanzania&#13;
managed to achieve a high rate of investment (over 20 percent of GDP). Yet&#13;
the productive sectors grew slowly, and the rate of return on new investment&#13;
was poor. 1/ Perhaps the biggest disappointment was agriculture, the dominant&#13;
sector in the economy, which grew by only 2.3 percent a year from 1966 to&#13;
1973. This was accompanied by rising income differentials between farmers in&#13;
the poorer and richer regions and precluded any narrowing of rural-urban income&#13;
differentials, despite the restrictions on official incomes imposed in 1967.&#13;
World Bank studies indicate that the rural-urban real income gap remained&#13;
unchanged from 1969 to 1975. Together with the increasing availability of&#13;
wage employment, this continued to attract more immigrants to the urban areas,&#13;
increasing urban unemployment and the impoverishment of the rapidly growing&#13;
low-income informal sector. Although Tanzania made rapid progress toward&#13;
"citizenization" of the economy, large gaps in manpower requirements remained.&#13;
And the dependence on foreign aid to finance both domestic investment and the&#13;
widening balance of payments gap increased.&#13;
The 1973-74 crisis&#13;
In 1973, and again in 1974, Tanzania experienced a drought and con-&#13;
sequently a serious shortfall in food production, as a result of which the&#13;
government had to import food. The overall drop in agricultural production&#13;
also caused a general decrease in the volume of exports, while at the same&#13;
time the terms of trade turned against Tanzania. The barter terms of trade&#13;
1/ The usual data difficulties are particularly severe in Tanzania, where&#13;
there is conflicting evidence on production trends, especially in the&#13;
rural subsistence sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
(see Table 11), after falling 11.5 percent from 1966 to 1973, rose by 4.3&#13;
percent from 1973 to 1974 and then fell by 22.5 percent from 1974 to 1975.&#13;
Combined with a drop in export volumes, the income terms of trade fell by 23.1&#13;
percent in 1974 and a further 12.5 percent in 1975, so that they were lower by&#13;
about one-third at the end of two years -- equivalent to a loss of $188 million&#13;
in 1975. The GDP growth rate fell to 3.1 percent in 1973 and 2.5 percent in&#13;
1974, with subsistence agriculture showing virtually no growth and monetary&#13;
agriculture actually declining.&#13;

During this period, the current account deficit, which had averaged&#13;
5.1 percent of GDP over the years 1970-72, rose to 7.4 percent of GDP in&#13;
1973, 16.2 percent of GDP in 1974, and 13.6 precent of GDP in 1975. The 1974&#13;
deficit ($342 million) was largely financed by net aid disbusements of $185&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
million, a drawdown of reserves of over $70 million and IMF drawings of&#13;
more than $42 million. The increase in the oil bill accounted for only $48&#13;
million of the $224 million deterioration in the current account from 1973 to&#13;
1974, the largest single factor having been a fourfold increase in imports of&#13;
food due to the drought and other dislocations in agriculture.&#13;
Policy response&#13;
The government's major short-term concern was to safeguard those&#13;
affected by the drought (through food imports) and to mitigate the effects&#13;
of inflation on other vulnerable groups. Large wage increases were granted&#13;
throughout the economy in May 1974 to try to shield workers from the effects&#13;
of inflation. 1/ As the crisis unfolded, the government severely tightened&#13;
controls on imports, raised indirect taxes, passed on imported petroleum price&#13;
rises, and froze wages. Some assistance was received from the IMF and from a&#13;
World Bank program loan. Recognizing that longer-term adjustments were also&#13;
needed to increase the production of tradeables, the government also planned&#13;
to redirect its development expenditures toward the productive sectors,&#13;
devalued the Tanzanian shilling by 10 percent against the IMF's special drawing&#13;
rights (SDR), and greatly increased administered producer prices of food crops.&#13;
The prices of export crops were not adjusted to the same degree, however, and&#13;
this radically changed the relative prices received by farmers. At the same&#13;
time, the government intensified its villagization program, which imposed&#13;
further strains on agricultural production, and advanced the target dates for&#13;
the achievement of universal primary education and universal rural water&#13;
supply.&#13;
1/ The national consumer price index rose 18.4 percent in 1974 and 27.0&#13;
percent in 1975, while the Dar es Salaam minimum wage earners retail&#13;
price index rose even faster.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
The coffee boom&#13;
The 1977 boom in coffee prices improved the balance of payments&#13;
position (coffee exports rose from $66 million in 1975 to $224 million in 1977&#13;
despite little change in volume) and, along with the continued restraint on&#13;
imports, led to a large buildup of reserves. In early 1977 the EAC collapsed,&#13;
forcing Tanzania, along with Kenya and Uganda, its former partners, to reorganize&#13;
former community services on a national basis. In 1976 the current account&#13;
deficit decreased significantly, to 4.1 percent of GDP, but widened again&#13;
slightly in 1977, to 5.2 percent of GDP.&#13;
In 1978 coffee prices fell again, and at the same time imports were&#13;
liberalized, especially to help the hard-pressed industrial sector. In October&#13;
1978, war broke out with Uganda, and this caused major disruption for the next&#13;
nine months. Export volumes continued to stagnate, and as a result the current&#13;
account deficit reached 14.7 percent of GDP in 1978 and 11.4 percent of GDP in&#13;
1979. The public finances, which had appeared to be under better control after&#13;
1977, deteriorated significantly, the overall budgetary deficit increasing from&#13;
6.8 percent of GDP in 1977/78 to 16 percent in 1978/79 and 12.6 percent in&#13;
1979/80.&#13;
Adjustment in Tanzania&#13;
Many changes or "shocks" took place over the period 1973-79, making&#13;
it difficult to distinguish the effects of each of them. In addition to the&#13;
oil price increase and the deterioration in export prices, there was drought,&#13;
internal dislocation in the agricultural sector due to decentralization and&#13;
villagization, and the war with Uganda in 1978. As indicated earlier, there&#13;
was a severe deterioration in the terms of trade in 1974-75, to which the&#13;
government responded by sharply curtailing domestic demand. Fiscal policy, a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
wage freeze, and a devaluation were the main instruments used. The growth rate&#13;
of total output and the consumption growth rate fell in 1974. Both public and&#13;
private consumption in real terms fell from 1974 to 1976, while the government&#13;
strived to maintain a high investment rate. At the same time, the effort was&#13;
made, through food imports and wage increases for the lowest paid, to ensure&#13;
that the lowest-income groups did not suffer during this adjustment process.&#13;
In 1978-79, by contrast, when the terms of trade again shifted against Tanzania,&#13;
the budgetary situation was under less strict control due primarily to the&#13;
demands of the conflict with Uganda.&#13;
Since 1973 Tanzania's foreign exchange position has, with the&#13;
exception of the coffee boom years, become increasingly tight. From 1973-79,&#13;
import capacity (see Table 12) has decreased by $143 million (at 1976-78&#13;
import prices), despite increasing aid disbursements. The major cause has&#13;
been declining exports. The terms of trade have fluctuated (Table 11) but&#13;
were only some 4 percent lower in 1979 than in 1973. The difficult foreign&#13;
exchange position has created increasing strain in the foreign exchange&#13;
allocation system and has made it almost impossible to maintain a rational&#13;
system of priorities. The government has tried to give priority to essential&#13;
consumer goods (especially food), to petroleum, and to capital goods. The&#13;
trend in the composition of imports has thus been toward machinery and trans-&#13;
port equipment and away from non-food consumer goods. The emphasis on capital&#13;
goods reflects the desire to maintain investment levels and thus the momentum&#13;
of development. But at some periods this has been at the expense of industrial&#13;
raw materials and intermediate goods, shortages of which have constrained&#13;
industrial output and have caused transport dislocations. More recently,&#13;
capital goods imports are being more strictly limited.&#13;

In the longer term, Tanzania has probably moved in exactly the&#13;
opposite direction from that necessitated by external conditions. This was&#13;
not intended by the government, but resulted in part from the implementation&#13;
of policies with other objectives as well as from a failure of policy to adapt&#13;
to changing circumstances. For example, in 1975 the government started to&#13;
shift the public sector investment program toward the productive sectors, but&#13;
the effects of this attempted shift on tradeable goods output were offset by&#13;
other factors, which are described below. The particular policies chosen to&#13;
implement certain of the government's objectives, especially in the agricultural&#13;
sector, have often been in conflict with the need for long-term adjustment.&#13;
The pattern of Tanzania's growth has shifted toward subsistence&#13;
agriculture and away from exports (see Table 13). According to the available&#13;
data, the GDP growth rate accelerated if the years 1973-79 are compared with&#13;
the years before the oil price shock, and nearly half the growth in GDP in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
recent years has occurred in the subsistence sector. Although there has&#13;
certainly been a switch toward subsistence agriculture and away from monetary&#13;
agriculture, the improvement in subsistence agriculture may be significantly&#13;

The switch to subsistence agriculture reflects, at least in part,&#13;
government pricing policy. Except for maize, official agricultural prices&#13;
have not kept pace with general inflation. The overall terms of trade for&#13;
marketed smallholder production have fallen by over 20 percent during the&#13;
1970s. 1/ At the same time, and because of the government's policy of raising&#13;

food crop prices faster than export crop prices, the terms of trade fell only&#13;
marginally for food crops but by almost one-third for export crops. In this&#13;
way, the potentially beneficial effects of the 1975 devaluation on export&#13;
production were cancelled out. The fall in export producer prices was not&#13;
determined by world market prices, but by rising marketing and administrative&#13;
costs of the parastatals that handle these crops, higher export duties which&#13;
cut into producers export earnings, and the policy of raising relative food&#13;
crop prices. The lack of incentives to grow export cash crops has led to a&#13;
movement back toward subsistence production, an expanding black market for&#13;
goods in short supply, and a thriving smuggling trade with neighboring countries.&#13;
Moreover, the encouragement given to food-crop marketing has not&#13;
worked satisfactorily.   The National Milling Corporation, which is the prin-&#13;
cipal marketing outlet for drought-resistant crops such as cassava and white&#13;
sorghum, has been able to sell only small quantities, and has thus been forced&#13;
to store and then export at a loss. The production and sale of these crops&#13;
has, at the margin, not only been at the expense of crops yielding more foreign&#13;
exchange, but has not contributed to domestic food consumption objectives&#13;
either. The policy has probably at best benefited urban consumers -- admittedly&#13;
an important group -- but is unlikely to have had much impact on rural consumers,&#13;
who are the most vulnerable to drought.&#13;
The long-term downward trend in the production of many of Tanzania's&#13;
major crops has also been associated with the depreciation of the capital&#13;
stock and other assets of the agricultural sector. The pattern of investment&#13;
in agriculture has been concentrated on the development of new plant and&#13;
machinery for crop processing while existing capacity, especially for pro-&#13;
duction, has been allowed to deteriorate. Further, parastatals that dominate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
the agricultural sector -- over 100 are directly responsible for agricultural&#13;
production -- are in chronic disarray. Their services to smallholders have&#13;
deteriorated, and the administration of state production has generally been&#13;
poor. Parastatals suffer from a shortage of trained manpower, a lack of&#13;
incentives, and poor management control. Government ministries suffer from&#13;
similar problems, most notably in the area of research, planning, and project&#13;
evaluation. Lines of authority and responsibility among government departments&#13;
and the party are blurred. Many of the current difficulties in agriculture&#13;
are also attributable to a steady deterioration in the transport system,&#13;
especially the poor maintenance of the road network, the dilapidation of the&#13;
trucking fleet, shortages of spares, shortages of staff, and weaknesses in&#13;
organization and management in the railways. These factors are neither unique&#13;
to Tanzania nor of recent origin. They form part of the nexus of problems that&#13;
have increasingly constrained the achievement of Tanzania's objectives in&#13;
agriculture and have thus also delayed the adjustment to changing international&#13;
economic conditions.&#13;
Although Tanzania has maintained a relatively high investment ratio,&#13;
the return on investment has been decreasing. The reasons for this in agri-&#13;
culture have been indicated above. In industry, where ICORs have risen from a&#13;
level of 3 to 4 in the early 1970s to over 10 in more recent years, the decline&#13;
in investment productivity reflects increasingly low capacity utilization as a&#13;
result of foreign exchange constraints and inadequate production of cash crops&#13;
that are used as inputs to industry. In addition, industrial output has&#13;
become concentrated on the larger firms, which are more capital intensive and&#13;
generate less employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
Tanzania's current difficulties are in large part the result of&#13;
adverse external developments over the past six years. But it is difficult to&#13;
attribute much of the problem to adverse terms-of-trade movements and other&#13;
shocks emanating from the international economy. Other "shocks" -- the war&#13;
with Uganda, the EAC breakup, drought -- have played at least as important a&#13;
role. But many of the problems clearly relate to institutional changes and&#13;
policies that have been having longer-term effects. These changes have not&#13;
in all cases had the intended effects, or have had damaging side effects (on&#13;
export growth, for example). Similarly, Tanzania's short-term adjustment&#13;
program (in 1975) reflected a strong spirit of sacrifice, in its cutting of&#13;
domestic demand and consumption. But at least some opportunities for increasing&#13;
production and exports (for example, by allowing the devaluation of 1975 to work&#13;
its way through to producer prices) were missed, and the sacrifice thus was made&#13;
greater than it need have been.&#13;
Senegal&#13;
Economic developments before 1974&#13;
Like Kenya, Senegal is on the borderline between low- and middle-&#13;
income African countries, with a GDP per capita in 1979 of $430. Its population&#13;
of 5.5 million is growing at about 2.6 percent a year. Since becoming independent&#13;
from France in 1960, it has enjoyed considerable political stability. Its&#13;
general policy stance has been "middle of the road," emphasizing "Senegalization"&#13;
and self-reliance. In the early 1970s, the government introduced a policy of&#13;
state participation in foreign-owned enterprises. It inherited a relatively&#13;
unequal income distribution that reflected the dominance of urban middle-class&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
groups, and this position does not appear to have changed greatly since&#13;
independence. Seventy percent of the population are engaged in agriculture,&#13;
growing groundnuts (the country's principal export) and millet and herding&#13;
cattle. Rural land distribution is fairly even. The country s resource&#13;
base is moderately favorable; there is still arable land available, phosphates&#13;
are being mined, there is iron ore, and there may be oil. Most of the rural&#13;
hinterland, however, belongs to the arid Sahel region.&#13;
The thrust of government policy has been to try to lessen&#13;
dependence on groundnut exports, food imports, and on rain-fed agriculture,&#13;
which is highly vulnerable to drought. Agricultural strategy has emphasized&#13;
import substitution, notably cotton, sugar, and irrigated rice. Important&#13;
parapublic enterprises in the fields of marketing, storage, extension, and&#13;
credit have developed over the years, in addition to many donor enclave agencies&#13;
and a strengthened regional administration that also has responsibilities for&#13;
development. In industry, the orientation has been toward domestic production&#13;
for the most part, although facilities have been developed for groundnut&#13;
crushing and tourism. Export-oriented heavy industry and an industrial free&#13;
zone for export crops have also received some encouragement.&#13;
GDP growth since 1960 has roughly matched population growth. From&#13;
1965 to 1973 the investment rate was low, and a series of droughts also contri-&#13;
buted to general stagnation. From 1973 to 1977 the economy recovered, as did&#13;
investment; but in 1977/78 and 1979/80 two bad crops broke the momentum, and&#13;
in 1980 GDP fell about 4 percent below its 1977 level.&#13;
This low growth rate reflected a number of strategic problems.&#13;
First, the climate and soils are difficult, and large parts of the country are&#13;
especially vulnerable to drought. Second, the international groundnut market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
has been eroded by competition from close substitutes. Third, the country is&#13;
short of managerial and technical skills. Fourth, the state participation&#13;
policy, by discouraging foreign investment, imposed a cost on growth, although&#13;
the policy responded to other government objectives. Fifth, farmers have not&#13;
adopted technical packages on a sufficient scale, in part because of inadequate&#13;
prices. (In the years 1975-76, when groundnut prices were higher and when&#13;
rainfall was favorable, groundnut production increased.) Exports have been&#13;
discriminated against, either through direct taxation, low producer prices, or&#13;
inefficient and costly marketing arrangements that prevent producers from&#13;
benefiting fully from world prices. Finally, the government's inward-looking&#13;
industrialization policy resulted in low capacity utilization in years of&#13;
depressed domestic demand; it appears from various studies of domestic resource&#13;
costs that the costs of import-competing goods in Senegal exceed the costs of&#13;
comparable goods on the world market by between 15 and 35 percent.&#13;
The impact of external shocks&#13;
Senegal's terms-of-trade fluctuations have been dominated by the&#13;
prices of groundnuts and phosphates, its two principal exports. Although&#13;
import prices increased significantly in 1974 as a result of the petroleum&#13;
price increase, the increase was more than offset that same year by the increase&#13;
in phosphate prices, which led to an overall improvement in the terms of trade&#13;
(see Table 14). The terms of trade then peaked again in 1978, this time&#13;
because of a boom in groundnut prices, but a disastrous crop prevented Senegal&#13;
from benefiting fully. The GDP growth rate during the 1970s was only partially&#13;
influenced by terms-of-trade developments. More important were the droughts of&#13;
1970/71, 1972/73, 1973/74, 1977/78, and 1979/80, which led to substantial falls&#13;
in GDP in those years. Similarly, the resource gap fluctuated in response to&#13;
these two same shocks -- terms-of-trade movements and drought.&#13;

After the rise in phosphate prices in 1973/74, the government&#13;
stepped up its investment program; projects to introducte new crops such as&#13;
sugar and cotton, develop tourism, and reduce rice imports through large-scale&#13;
irrigation were started. Budgetary resources were also applied to increased&#13;
subsidies, which followed an increase in agricultural producer prices, and to&#13;
more state participation in foreign enterprises. Since the medium-term outlook&#13;
for phosphate prices at that time seemed favorable, the government increased&#13;
its external borrowing significantly to help finance the investment program and&#13;
state participation. In 1975/76, when groundnut and phosphate prices fell&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
again, the government pressed on with its programs, depending on additional&#13;
domestic and foreign borrowing. It slowly became clear that the outlook for&#13;
phosphate prices had been mistakenly optimistic. By 1979/80 a growing financial&#13;
crisis was apparent, due to the bad groundnut crop, falling groundnut prices,&#13;
rising oil import prices and food imports. In addition, the debt incurred&#13;
earlier in the 1970s, to finance the public sector investment and the acqui-&#13;
sition of private sector enterprises by the government, had reached high&#13;
levels. Much of this debt was on commercial terms.&#13;
With the exception of the years 1973 and 1974, the ratio of&#13;
investment to GDP has remained quite low, at 12 to 13 percent (see Table 15).&#13;
As indicated earlier, total investment might have increased faster if the&#13;
government's state participation policy had not discouraged private foreign&#13;
investment. It also proved difficult for the government to generate sufficient&#13;
directly productive investments of good quality. Many of the planned industrial&#13;
investments turned out to be unfeasible, and the irrigation scheme proved to be&#13;
more difficult to implement than expected. As a result, a larger share of&#13;
investment funds was devoted to infrastructure, and the investment boom failed&#13;
to generate the benefits in GDP growth that had been hoped for.&#13;

The GDP growth rate averaged 2.3 percent both in 1971-75 and in&#13;
1975-79. But the consumption growth rate, which was only 1.9 percent in&#13;
the former period, accelerated to 5.2 percent in 1975-79. Related to this,&#13;
import volumes expanded significantly, and the ratio of imports to GDP, which&#13;
had been steady at around 33 to 34 percent in the early 1970s, climbed to over&#13;
41 percent by 1979. A large part of the increase was in foodstuffs and consumer&#13;
goods, much of it oriented toward middle-class expatriate urban demand, stimulated&#13;
by increases in urban wages after 1974 and a substantial credit expansion. (The&#13;
government had developed the practice of cancelling farmers' debts in bad crop&#13;
years 1/ and maintaining a regime of easy credit).&#13;

1971-77 but shot up to 13.6 percent in 1978 and 13.7 percent in 1979. The&#13;

over total debt outstanding has increased from just under 10 percent in&#13;
1971/72 to over 17 percent in 1978/79 (see Table 16).&#13;

Adjustment in Senegal&#13;
Senegal's experience points to three general issues of interest to&#13;
adjustment policy. First, there is the problem of cyclical management. The&#13;
combination of terms-of-trade effects and drought effects causes great&#13;
difficulty for long-term planning in Senegal and places great demands on&#13;
counter-cyclical monetary and budgetary management. In the early 1970s, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
particular at the time of the phosphate price boom, these problems were&#13;
compounded by mistaken expectations about long-term price changes. The&#13;
difficulty of changing investment programs in response to rapid changes in&#13;
the price outlook must be appreciated. Second, successful adjustment must&#13;
depend in part on being able to change the economic structure fairly rapidly&#13;
through a high investment rate. The experience of the 1970s shows that, even&#13;
where the public sector investment rate was being incre~ased quite rapidly, the&#13;
total investment rate did not increase for a number of reasons. The political&#13;
environment, and especially state participation, discouraged private&#13;
investment -- viable investments were not easy to find, particularly given the&#13;
uncertainties confronting some of the new resources that became available to&#13;
Senegal, and given the great difficulties of diversifying the agricultural&#13;
sector. Many of the new projects started at that time came into serious&#13;
difficulties and failed to generate adequate returns. Third, there is the&#13;
relatively high-cost structure of the Senegalese economy, which has prevented&#13;
successful trade diversification. Senegal has considerable opportunities to&#13;
expand the processing of domestic raw materials, especially cotton, fish, and&#13;
phosphate rock. The government has also tried to develop an export industry&#13;
based on imported raw materials, exploiting Senegal's entrepot position on&#13;
the West African coast. But local labor costs have been too high for either&#13;
of these approaches to be internationally competitive. Since Senegal's&#13;
membership in the Monetary Union of West African States (UMOA) prevents it&#13;
from devaluing unilaterally, it must either increase labor productivity or&#13;
reduce money wages if these opportunities are to be developed. There is,&#13;
however, clear scope for import substitution, especially in such areas as&#13;
food production, and especially if income -- hence demand for basic consumer&#13;
goods -- can be shifted toward the poorer rural groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Sudan&#13;
Economic developments before 1974.&#13;
Sudan is the largest country in Africa in area, but since it&#13;
consists of large areas of desert or semi-desert, it is sparsely populated&#13;
and incomes are low. However, it has great untapped potential for agric-&#13;
ultural development. The economy is heavily dependent on cotton exports,&#13;
produced under irrigation schemes, some of them producing for fifty years or&#13;
more. From the mid-1950s until 1972, civil war and bloodshed in southern&#13;
Sudan claimed considerable human and financial resources. Thus it was not&#13;
until after the Addis Ababa accord of 1972 that the government was able to&#13;
shift its attention to planned economic development. The government's develop-&#13;
ment objectives, articulated in the 1973 Interim Action Program, were designed&#13;
to remove severe infrastructural bottlenecks, attain self-sufficiency in&#13;
selected consumer goods, and expand export earnings.&#13;
The tasks facing the government were formidable. Between 1970 and&#13;
1973 the economy, torn by war, was stagnant and per capita incomes were&#13;
falling. The economy was heavily dependent, as it still is today, on the&#13;
agricultural sector, which contributed nearly half of GDP in 1970 and employed&#13;
over two-thirds of the labor force. Agriculture was the source of virtually&#13;
all export earnings, of which over half were derived from a single crop,&#13;
cotton. The irrigation system, under which most of the cotton was grown, was&#13;
deteriorating. By 1970 Sudan, the largest country in Africa, had only 375&#13;
kilometers of paved roads. Since the only road linking Khartoum to Port&#13;
Sudan, some 700 kilometers to the northeast, was unpaved, the capital city&#13;
had to depend largely on a poorly maintained railway for shipments to and from&#13;
the coast. Communication with the south was unreliable, depending mostly on a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
weak and inefficient river transport system, a situation that has remained&#13;
almost unchanged to the present day. The illiteracy rate was 85 percent and&#13;
was probably even higher in the south, where a whole generation had grown up&#13;
without education due to the civil war.&#13;
The Interim Action Program focused on the improvement of roads,&#13;
railways, power, irrigation systems, and industries.    Because of domestic&#13;
resource constraints, difficulties in the utilization of available external&#13;
assistance, and poor implementation capacity, however, the execution of many&#13;
projects was delayed. These huge capital investment programs and the need for&#13;
funds to cover losses of public corporations led to a rapid rise in public&#13;
sector deficits and inadequately controlled external borrowing on unfavorable&#13;
terms. The deterioration of the fiscal position also contributed to poor&#13;
maintenance of the existing capital stock.&#13;
The program lacked the support of the macro-economic policies needed&#13;
to increase incentives to the productive sectors generally, and particularly&#13;
to improve the domestic terms of trade for the agricultural sector. Limited&#13;
government management capacity became even more strained when major establish-&#13;
ments in transport, power, industry, and finance were nationalized in 1970/71.&#13;
By the time of the 1973/74 oil crisis the country had started to incur&#13;
balance-of-payment deficits and, despite the rapid increases in investments,&#13;
production was stagnating.&#13;
The shocks of 1974-75&#13;
The 1973/74 increase in import prices, though substantial (see&#13;
Table 17), was more than compensated for by increased export prices (mainly&#13;
cotton, groundnuts, sesame, and gum arabic), and the terms of trade actually&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
improved. The year 1975, however, saw a fall in export prices and a terms-&#13;
of-trade deterioration. 1/ Exports fell drastically in 1974 and recovered&#13;
only slightly in 1975, while imports, fueled by investment demand, continued&#13;
growing. Cotton production fell from 675,000 tons in 1970 to 332,000 tons in&#13;
1976. In a matter of two years, between 1973 and 1975, Sudan's current&#13;
account deficit thus jumped from 1.9 to 14.8 percent of GDP (see Table 17).&#13;

Capital flows, mainly from the Middle East and workers- remittances,&#13;
provided an initial cushion to support the rising import levels. International&#13;
reserves also fell to less than the equivalent of two weeks' imports. When&#13;
1/   While the cost of oil imports rose sharply, the price of sugar (which up&#13;
to 1974 cost Sudan as much as oil) fell.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
these capital flows started declining, imports were maintained by incurring&#13;
external debt payment arrears and by increased imports of goods under the&#13;
"Nil Value" licensing system, through which savings accumulated by Sudanese&#13;
working abroad were utilized. By September 1979, however, external payment&#13;
arrears had reached about $1.2 billion, and Sudan was beginning to experience&#13;
difficulties in paying even for normal trade imports. The debt-service ratio,&#13;
which was 11 percent in 1973, had reached 35 percent in 1978.&#13;
It was not until 1978 that the government decided to review its&#13;
priorities, in particular its investment strategy. It supplemented the&#13;
Six-Year Plan with less ambitious, rolling three-year investment programs&#13;
beginning with the period 1978/79-1980/81. Priority was given to completion&#13;
of ongoing projects and new projects that promise quick foreign-exchange&#13;
returns by rehabilitating existing capital stock or easing infrastructural&#13;
bottlenecks, and the volume of investment was scaled down by about 20 percent&#13;
compared with the same period of the Six-Year Plan. An Export Action Program&#13;
was introduced, involving policy changes designed to encourage increased&#13;
production from the irrigated sector; the provision of urgently needed imports&#13;
for the major irrigation schemes; and a series of projects to rehabilitate and&#13;
modernize the major irrigation schemes. In addition to these measures, the&#13;
government tightened its procedures for mobilizing external resources by&#13;
centralizing authority for borrowing and creating institutions to examine the&#13;
appropriateness of new loans relating to projects and lending terms. The&#13;
government also negotiated debt rescheduling. Finally, the currency was&#13;
devalued three times between 1978/79 and 1979/80.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Adjustment in Sudan&#13;
Sudan's crisis was not caused by external factors, nor did the&#13;
government take any special steps following the oil price increase of the&#13;
mid-1970s. Instead, it pressed ahead with its development program. Its&#13;
current difficulties arise most clearly out of the combined effects of an&#13;
overly ambitious public sector investment program and the excessive&#13;
accumulation of debt to finance it, against the background of a faltering&#13;
productive base. The public sector investment program was conceived in 1973,&#13;
when it appeared that the combination of Sudan's agricultural potential and&#13;
the financial resources of the oil-rich Middle East countries could turn Sudan&#13;
into the "breadbasket of the Middle East." The program accordingly emphasized&#13;
food and others crops that did not accord with Sudan's long-term comparative&#13;
advantage; it also gave priority to large new projects that were excessively&#13;
demanding of management capacity and infrastructure and that were in addition&#13;
in some cases fairly risky (for example, sugar). Some of the projects required&#13;
long gestation periods and the massive importation of raw materials, spares,&#13;
and frequently even manpower, as well as equipment and machinery, with less&#13;
attention to the utilization of local resources. The program also placed&#13;
inadequate emphasis on the maintenance and rehabilitation needs of existing&#13;
projects, especially in the irrigated sector, and on the country's weak trans-&#13;
port infrastructure. The investment program reached its height at the same&#13;
time that Sudan's most qualified managers and other skilled groups were being&#13;
lost to oil-surplus countries elsewhere in the Middle East. The borrowing&#13;
that Sudan undertook during the 1970s was therefore excessive in relation to&#13;
absorptive capacity. Its terms were also too hard; much of Sudan's initial&#13;
borrowing was done in the financial markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

V. Conclusions&#13;
The experience of the 1970s&#13;
As a group, the low- and middle-income oil-importing African&#13;
countries closed the 1970s with per capita growth so low that some of them&#13;
were actually poorer than at the beginning of the decade, with accelerating&#13;
rates of population growth, large and growing current account deficits (even&#13;
before the latest oil price shock), and, for those few countries with some&#13;
limited creditworthiness during the decade, a significantly increased debt&#13;
service burden. This contrasts with the experience of the 1960s and the early&#13;
part of the last decade (up to 1973) when GNP growth, though lower than in&#13;
most other regions, was sufficient to generate rising living standards.&#13;
Some of this slowdown can be attributed to external shocks, espe-&#13;
cially the oil price increase of 1974-75 and its aftermath. For many of the&#13;
countries in this group, the terms of trade deteriorated sharply in 1974 and&#13;
1975. Oil imports rose from 7 to 8 percent of exports in 1970 to 21 percent&#13;
in 1975 for low-income Africa and 15 percent for middle-income Africa. The&#13;
years 1974-76 consequently saw a recession in many of these countries, induced&#13;
largely by external developments, but also reflecting other internal "shocks"&#13;
-- drought, civil and regional conflicts. In some cases, these shocks were&#13;
cushioned by compensating flows of concessional capital. Subsequently, from&#13;
1976 to 1978 many countries experienced gains as the prices of coffee, cocoa,&#13;
and some minerals peaked. A revival then took place, and several countries&#13;
accelerated their development efforts through increased public sector invest-&#13;
ment programs. There was considerable fluctuation in the terms of trade,&#13;
but no general deterioration over the 1970-78 period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
For the most part, neither exports nor import-substitution increased&#13;
after the first oil price shock. Adjustment therefore took the form of reduced&#13;
domestic output, offset in part by increased external assistance and in part&#13;
by compensating terms-of-trade movements. This failure of the productive&#13;
sectors to respond reflects in part the unfavorable initial conditions which&#13;
Africa faced, and which would have constrained progress even if external&#13;
circumstances had been better -- a limited or under-exploited resource base,&#13;
weak institutions, limited skills, a lack of infrastructure -- in short, the&#13;
structure of poverty itself. In part, it reflects the results of particular&#13;
policies and weak economic management.&#13;
Demand management&#13;
For the most part, the four countries studied took appropriate steps&#13;
to bring about short-term adjustment after the first oil price shock, at least&#13;
in the limited sense of maintaining financial stability.l/ The short-term&#13;
adjustment measures taken -- generally fiscal and monetary policy, some&#13;
exchange rate adjustments, income policies -- have been principally successful&#13;
in restraining domestic demand, often at quite severe short-term costs in&#13;
modern sector employment and incomes. Efforts have generally been made to&#13;
protect weaker social groups and to maintain economic and social development&#13;
programs, though success with the former has tended to run into more funda-&#13;
mental difficulties in administering price controls and in delivering publicly&#13;
provided services.&#13;
1/ Sudan, as noted, experienced improving terms of trade and took no&#13;
deflationary measures until 1978.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
There was less success in ensuring that measures to manage demand&#13;
were complemented by measures to encourage the production of tradeable goods,&#13;
especially exports, which could have enabled growth to continue. Tanzania's&#13;
pricing policies, for example, offset the potentially favorable impact of&#13;
exchange rate adjustment on exports, while Sudan's export tax system had the&#13;
same result. With hindsight, it appears that these policies have carried a&#13;
higher cost in growth terms than was anticipated at the time.&#13;
Investment programs&#13;
Sudan, Senegal, and, to a lesser extent, Kenya embarked upon or&#13;
expanded public sector investment programs during the 1970s. It is clear&#13;
that in several cases these programs, whatever the virtues of the individual&#13;
projects taken piecemeal, were over-ambitious in relation to available&#13;
technical and managerial capacity. In addition, the Sudanese and Senegalese&#13;
programs subsequently fell victim to financial stringency, caused in part by&#13;
international economic problems but more significantly by unperceived or&#13;
inadequately anticipated inefficiencies in the functioning of existing facili-&#13;
ties, especially in the public sector. The reaction to financial stringency&#13;
was then to try to defend these programs by continuing to allocate increasingly&#13;
scarce resources to them. Overall average factor productivity (reflected in,&#13;
for example, high and rising ICORs) has been falling, despite the apparently&#13;
worthwhile nature of these programs and projects taken individually. This&#13;
tendency has been associated with the growing importance of aid during this&#13;
period and has reflected in large part the preference of aid donors for new&#13;
investment rather than recurrent or local cost financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
Foreign exchange allocation and trade bias&#13;
Related to this over-expansion of investment programs is the&#13;
experience of systems of foreign exchange allocation (especially in Kenya&#13;
and Tanzania). These systems have typically been premised on the same&#13;
principle underlying the investment programs, namely that new investment&#13;
should receive priority (at least after the allocation of available&#13;
resources to essentials). But in the process, and as available foreign&#13;
exchange resources become increasingly constrained, existing productive&#13;
facilities and infrastructure become starved of inputs and spares. In Kenya,&#13;
the effect of these controls has been to add a further twist to the anti-trade&#13;
bias previously evident in the pattern of Kenya's industrialization.&#13;
Exports&#13;
The issues relating to poor export performance in all the countries&#13;
considered are complex and deep-seated. They are obviously in part a matter&#13;
of structure -- the countries produce commodities for which world trade is&#13;
neither buoyant nor stable (cocoa, coffee, groundnuts, phosphate); there are&#13;
serious technological constraints in agriculture; there are manpower con-&#13;
straints; institutional problems abound; energy supplies are limited at least&#13;
in the short term. But policy appears to have consistently underestimated the&#13;
responsiveness to incentives of all kinds (not just prices) and to have given&#13;
inadequate priority to agriculture, not only in areas that have obvious and&#13;
direct relevance to the sector (investment programs, pricing and marketing&#13;
arrangements, etc.), but also through many aspects of the macroeconomic policy&#13;
frame (the exchange rate and the tax structure) that have indirect effects.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            External shocks, mainly adverse terms of
            trade movements and slower world trade growth, in 1974-78
            contributed to the slowdown in growth experienced by low-
            and middle-income oil-importing African countries. But other
            internal shocks also contributed, as did structural
            constraints and weak economic management. Moreover, several
            countries experienced favorable terms of trade movements
            during that period, and aid generally increased. The
            experience of four countries -- Kenya, Tanzania, Senegal,
            and Sudan -- illustrates some aspects of managing
            adjustments to external shocks: successful short-term demand
            management did not necessarily lead to increased production;
            over-ambitious investment programs were defended at the
            expense of ongoing operations; foreign exchange was
