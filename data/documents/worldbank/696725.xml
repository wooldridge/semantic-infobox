This report is based on the findings of the appraisal and post-appraisal missions that visited Panama in May and&#13;
July, 1995, respectively. Mission members were C. Chiappe (Task Manager); M. Vera, E. Waters, and H. Yang&#13;
(LA2HR); M. Mathov (OBPIE); C. Benito, J.M. Ezquivel, and B. Hermosilla (Consultants); and F. Fuentes (RUTA&#13;
Social). It has benefitted greatly from the inputs of Eleanor Schreiber (LA2HR); L.Kebeck contributed to the&#13;
report at headquarters. Messrs. Edilberto L. Segura (LA2DR) and Kye Woo Lee (LA2HR) are the Department&#13;
Director and Division  Chief, respectively, for this operation.  Peer Reviewers are  C. Valdivieso  (ESP) and M&#13;

THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA&#13;
BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A. Economic and Social Setting&#13;
1.1   The Panamanian economy is among the more prosperous and stable in the Central&#13;
American region. Nonetheless, the economy is highly segrnented, between the dynamic,&#13;
internationally-oriented service sector, which generates about 75 percent of gross domestic&#13;
product (GDP), and the domestically-oriented sector, characterized by policy-induced rigidities&#13;
and low productivity. Panama's wealth has cushioned it from the worst economic consequences&#13;
of its failure to undertake structural adjustment. While it has avoided the economic crisis which&#13;
has plagued the rest of Central America, Panama is now paying for economic mismanagement in&#13;
the form of missed opportunities. In 1989, the poorest 20 percent of the population received 2&#13;
percent of national income, the lowest share in Latin America. This group saw its relative&#13;
position worsen since 1980, when it received nearly 4 percent of national income.&#13;
1.2   Panama has 2.3 million inhabitants, and although its socioeconomnic indicators are among&#13;
the best in Central America, its two percent annual population growth rate and 2.9 births per&#13;
woman are the lowest in the region, while its infant mortality (21 in 1,000), life expectancy (73),&#13;
and acceptance of family planning are only slightly behind Costa Rica in the six-country Central&#13;
American region. Broad public health and social security coverage are responsible for these&#13;
favorable national indicators. However, these statistics mask significant regional differences within&#13;
the country, and wide variations from the mean within each indicator. The population is multi-&#13;
ethnic, with persons of European, African, Asian, and indigenous descent, the latter group&#13;
constituting 8.3 percent of the population in 1990. The indigenous population is principally&#13;
located in the provinces of Bocas del Toro, Darien, Chiriqui, and in the San Blas region in Colon.&#13;
These areas have generally unfavorable socioeconomic indicators.&#13;
1.3   Analyses carried out by the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy (MIPPE) indicate&#13;
that in spite of gains made during the 1970's and early 1980's, almost 25 percent of Panama's&#13;
population lives in conditions of critical poverty with social indicators typical of low income&#13;
countries. In the ten poorest districts (out of 67), which account for about 15 percent of&#13;
Panama's total population: (a) the average household earned less than US$ 850 per annum, about&#13;
one third of the cost of the basic food basket for a family of five; (b) life expectancy at birth is ten&#13;
years below the national average; (c) the infant mortality rate ranges between 50 and 75 per&#13;
thousand live births, three to four times the national average; (d) 40 to 70 percent of children aged&#13;
6 to 9 suffer from moderate to severe growth retardation due to chronic malnutrition, compared&#13;
to a national average of 24 percent; and (e) almost one third of households do not have access to&#13;
a protected water supply or basic sanitation (latrine). These pockets of poverty fall into one of&#13;
two types: (a) more remote rural areas with limited natural resources and agricultural potential,&#13;
including areas inhabited predominantly by indigenous people; and (b) peri-urban (slum)&#13;
settlements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. The Education Sector&#13;
(1) The Education System&#13;
1.4   The education system in Panama consists of pre-primary, primary, secondary and higher&#13;
education with the following distribution of students:&#13;
Table 1. Panamanian School System - 1992&#13;
Students            Teachers             Institutions&#13;
Pre-school          33,288                1,447               894&#13;
Primary             356,247               14,249              2,744&#13;
Secondary           201,047               10,052              223&#13;
University          63,288               3,609                4&#13;
Basic education is defined as two years of preschool, six years of primary school (grades 1-6) and&#13;
three years of lower secondary school (grades 7-9).&#13;
1.5  It is mandatory that pre-school services be provided, but it is not mandatory that parents&#13;
send their children to pre-school. It consists of nursery school (Pre-jardines de Infancia) for&#13;
four-year-olds, and kindergarten (Jardines de Infancia) for five-year-olds. Jardines de Infancia&#13;
are one-year schooling programs that emphasize readiness for reading and writing. There are&#13;
about 33,000 children enrolled in 894 Jardines de Infancia. About two thirds of these are public&#13;
institutions, and the remainder are private. The majority of kindergarten students attend classes in&#13;
primary school buildings. About 45 percent of five-year-olds are enrolled in kindergarten, a figure&#13;
significantly lower than other Latin American countries of similar income level. Pre-school&#13;
students in Panama are evenly divided between males and females. The pre-school coverage by&#13;
province reveals an inverse relationship between coverage and provincial poverty (Annex 1).&#13;
Thus, the current program serves mostly the wealthy provinces and Panama City, with a&#13;
curriculum developed for implementation by highly educated teachers.&#13;
1.6 Panama has developed a pilot program, the Community and Family Center for Initial&#13;
Education (CEFACEI), to provide community-based pre-school services for four- and five-year-&#13;
olds. The CEFACEIs use infrastructure provided by the community and a community educator&#13;
(promotora), with or without formal training, to provide educational services to 15-21 children.&#13;
At this time, there are approximately 1,600 children in 88 centers located in rural and marginal&#13;
urban areas. Up until now, it has operated only in communities that can afford to pay a&#13;
promotora. The CEFACEI program is an alternative for rural and poor areas where it is difficult&#13;
to retain highly qualified teachers. Therefore, the curriculum must be presented to poorly&#13;
educated parents and community educators through clear and simple messages conveyed through&#13;
appealing educational materials. However, the existing pre-school curriculum is presented in&#13;
excessively technical terms that require interpretation by highly trained teachers. The majority of&#13;
CEFACEIpromotoras are therefore limited to child care activities. The workplace programs,&#13;
known as Centers of Infant and Family Orientation (COIFs), are administered by the Ministry of&#13;
Labor, and are available for children three to five years old in 70 centers mainly in Panama city&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
and other urban areas. The COIFs' principal purpose is to provide child care for parents working&#13;
in public offices.&#13;
1.7   Primary school is mandatory and free, consisting of six grades and currently serving&#13;
approximately 360,000 students. There are approximately 14,300 teachers and 2,700 schools.&#13;
Only five percent of all primary schools are private. The primary school level is characterized by&#13;
high enrollment ratios, qualified teachers, and low student/teacher ratios. The net enrollment rate&#13;
in primary school is 91 percent, comparable to that of other countries in Latin America with good&#13;
education indicators. The gross enrollment rate is 105 percent and also comparable to the rates of&#13;
other Latin American countries with strong education systems. There does not appear to be a&#13;
consistent correlation between net enrollment and the income level of a province. However, the&#13;
poorest region of San Blas has an exceptionally low net enrollment rate of 64.6 percent, which is&#13;
probably due to both the poverty level and the difficulty of access to schools in the area. The&#13;
relatively large size of its indigenous population has also hindered its integration into the country's&#13;
predominantly Hispanic culture. Three out of five Panamanian students who begin primary school&#13;
do not complete the cycle in the anticipated six years, and the repetition rate in the four poorest&#13;
provinces is close to 20 percent. Primary enrollment for the country is 47.6 percent female while&#13;
they represent 49.1 percent of the population in the age bracket. Differences appear when&#13;
analyzing the poorest corregimientos of the country', in which female enrollment is 46.9 percent.&#13;
At the national level, the drop out rate is low, under 2.0 percent. However, when data are&#13;
analyzed by corregimientos, the poorest have drop out rates around 6.0 percent. The failure rate&#13;
is almost 10 percent nationally but, again, goes up to 12.3 percent for the poorest corregimientos&#13;
(Annex 1).&#13;
1.8    The public primary student/teacher ratio is 25. The current number of teachers on the&#13;
public payrol can serve all the projected primary school-age population of 1999. Even the&#13;
province with the highest student/teacher ratio at present would have a ratio of only 31, using the&#13;
current student/teacher ratio per province. Ratios in eight provinces would still be below 30&#13;
(Annex 1).&#13;
1.9   There is no standard system to evaluate the quality of education. The information&#13;
available suggests that average quality is low. This is a critical issue since Panama devotes a&#13;
substantial amount of economic resources to education. The sector has one of the best paid&#13;
teaching forces in the region (Annex 2) and fairly good infrastructure, the two most expensive&#13;
components of the primary school student unit cost. An ample, perhaps excessive, future supply&#13;
of teachers is ensured, with over 7,000 students currently at the School of Education of the&#13;
University of Panama and 1,000 at the teacher training institute (Escuela AIormal).&#13;
1.10 Primary school teachers in Panama have good fornal training in subject knowledge; about&#13;
80 percent of the teachers have Normal School degrees (secondary level) and almost all others&#13;
have university-level degrees, many of them pedagogical. Almost all of them attend two-week in-&#13;
'Panama has 9 Provinces, 67 Districts, one region and, until 1993, it had 5 10 Corregimientos. In 1993, the&#13;
county seat of the district of Santiago de Veraguas was split, and the new corregimiento of Canto del Llano&#13;
was formed, so today there are officially 5 11 corregimientos. This document uses existent data from the&#13;
original 5 10 corregimientos.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
service training sessions every year of their career. These courses emphasize language and math,&#13;
but also include other disparate topics such as computer sdcills, folklore dances, and civil&#13;
protection, among others, that are indicative of the overall irrelevance and lack of focus of a large&#13;
part of the program. Such a program would be more useful if it were more sharply focused on the&#13;
learning needs of students. The most extreme example of this is the lack of pre- and in-service&#13;
training in multigrade teaching techniques, in spite of the fact that almost three quarters of all&#13;
primary schools in Panama have multigrade classes. Pre-service and in-service training in&#13;
multigrade techniques would maximize the strong pedagogical qualifications that most teachers&#13;
bring to the job, leading to a higher quality of education in multigrade classrooms.&#13;
1.11   Secondary school services are also free, but not yet mandatory. There are about 200,000&#13;
students, 10,000 teachers, and 223 schools; 17.4 percent of the enrollment and 39.6 percent of the&#13;
schools are private. Secondary education is organized in two cycles of three years each. The first&#13;
cycle (grades 7-9) covers general subjects and is part of the basic education program. The second&#13;
cycle (grades 10-12) has two tracks: (a) academic, including science and humanities sub-tracks;&#13;
and (b) professional-technical, with sub-tracks in commerce, industry, agriculture, homemaking&#13;
and cosmetology. Over the last five years, the percentage of students in each track has remained&#13;
relatively constant, with about 43 percent of the students enrolled in the academic track and the&#13;
balance enrolled in the professional-technical track (Annex 1).&#13;
1.12 Administration of the education sector is centralized. The Ministry of Education&#13;
(MOE) directs pre-school, primary, secondary and adults education. Vocational training is the&#13;
responsibility of the National Institute for Vocational Training (INAFORP) reporting to the&#13;
Ministry of Labor. The two public universities are administratively autonomous. MOE&#13;
establishes the norms and procedures for the administration of personnel and physical resources,&#13;
and defines the curricula, in-service teacher training and supervision. Each province has a&#13;
regional MOE office with representatives responsible for the administration of personnel and&#13;
physical resources, and a supervisor in charge of actions related to curricula, in-service teacher&#13;
training and supervision. Public education at all levels is financed by the national Government. In&#13;
the private sector, MOE authorizes the opening of centers for pre-primary, primary and secondary&#13;
education and regulates their functioning. Private universities must seek approval to open from&#13;
the University of Panama, the largest public institution of higher education.&#13;
1.13  Private schooling. Panama has a weak tradition of private schooling. Only 8 percent of&#13;
primary enrollment is private and, at the secondary level, the figure is as little as 17 percent . At&#13;
pre-school the situation is somewhat different since the private sector represents almost 30&#13;
percent of the students. Differences between private and public sector regarding repetition and&#13;
dropout indicators are noticeable. For the primary private schools, the repetition rate is only 0.7,&#13;
while the public sector figure is 10 percent. Disparities are also present in the drop out rates with&#13;
only 0.2 percent for the private sector and 1.7 percent for the public sector. At the secondary&#13;
level, the issue is not the drop out rate, similar in both sectors, but the failure rate, that is 11.4&#13;
percent for public and only 6.1 percent for private sector students. The above differences signal&#13;
the inequities in the quality of the education, which, in tum, rely heavily on inputs such as&#13;
educational materials, well trained teachers and good preparation for entering school.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
(2) Key Issues&#13;
1.14  Generally good indicators hide the skewed expenditure pattem and management&#13;
shortcomings evident in poor quality and inadequate coverage. The gross enrollment rate at the&#13;
primary level is 105 percent, but only 28 percent in preschool (ages 3-5) and 77 percent at the&#13;
lower secondary level (grades 7-9). The skewed resource allocation pattern for education has the&#13;
effect of heightening disparities in income distribution. This is a common issue in many countries&#13;
in the region where a fixed share of budget resources is constitutionally mandated for higher&#13;
education. The Bank has started a policy dialogue with the Government to establish a more&#13;
rational allocation of budget resources among the different levels of education, and a study of this&#13;
problem has been proposed in the project.&#13;
1.15 Education Finance. Overall education spending in Panama has been consistently high in&#13;
recent decades, including the period of economic crisis in the second half of the 1980s. Spending&#13;
continues to be high today, at 5.5 percent of GNP and 16.4 percent of total public expenditures.&#13;
However, expenditure is disproportionately allocated. Higher education receives almost one third&#13;
of public education resources while serving only 10 percent of public school students. The 1.7&#13;
percent of total public education expenditures allocated to pre-primary schools is far below&#13;
intemational levels (Costa Rica spends 3.6 percent, and Mexico spends 6.1 percent). Subsidies&#13;
are disproportionately directed to those attending higher education institutions. Resources are&#13;
limited for those attending lower level educational institutions, where representation of poor&#13;
economic groups is broader. Studies in many countries demonstrate that labor earnings are&#13;
positively related to the level of education acquired. Therefore, the extent of cost recovery should&#13;
increase with the level of education. At US$ 1,400, the annual unit cost for higher education in&#13;
Panama is high in comparison to other middle-income Latin American countries with similar size&#13;
populations. And yet, university students are charged an annual fee of only US$ 50, that covers&#13;
only 3.6 percent of the real cost, and are given grants, regardless of need, to defray living&#13;
expenses (Annex 2).&#13;
1.16 Poor quality and inequitable distribution of education. Quality problems are not as&#13;
obvious in Panama as they are in many other countries in the region. There is a well qualified&#13;
teaching force, and a relatively low ratio of 25 students per teacher. Good textbooks are available&#13;
in the market, and teachers can select and recommend to their students those that are most&#13;
suitable for the curriculum. But the quality of education is not evenly distributed. Poor students&#13;
cannot purchase their books and usually do not find them in school libraries. Multigrade classes&#13;
are taught by teachers without specialized training in the methods of multigrade teaching. Since&#13;
multigrade classes are typical of remote rural comnmunities, it is generally the children of the poor&#13;
who attend such classes and receive a lower quality education. The consequence is an inefficient&#13;
system in which students take an average of 13 years to complete the nine-year cycle of primary&#13;
and lower secondary. When analyzing the poorest corregimientos of the country, inequity is&#13;
expressed in the highest drop out and failure rates, and lower female enrollment. Female&#13;
enrollment goes down to 46.9 percent, drop out increases to about 6.0 percent and reaches 29&#13;
percent in the 24 poorest of the 510 corregimientos. A simnilar situation occurs with the failure&#13;
rate which is less than 10 percent nationally, goes up to 12.3 percent in the poorest&#13;
corregimientos and is over 20 percent in 50 of them. The project will provide textbooks for poor&#13;
students and specialized training and teaching materials for multigrade teachers targeting the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
poorest corregimlentos. It wili also develop a student achievement evaluation system (paras. 2.7-&#13;
2.13, 2.17-2.19).&#13;
1.17 Inadequate pre-primary education services. Inequities also exist in the availability of&#13;
educational benefits for the poor and the disadvantaged. Enrollment rates are high at the primary&#13;
level, but very few children have access to pre-primary educational services, even though early&#13;
educational experiences have long been recognized as having an important effect in improving&#13;
student performance at the primary level. Preschool education promotes school readiness, lowers&#13;
repetition and drop out rates, and improves academic skills in primary school. Pre-primary&#13;
education is offered mainly in kindergarten classes attached to the primary schools. Non-formal&#13;
models of preschool education have proven to be highly effective, at a considerably lower cost&#13;
than the formal models. But the CEFACEIs (para. 1.6) lack an appropriate curriculum for the&#13;
culture of the disadvantaged. The kindergarten curriculum is not easily handled by unqualified&#13;
community educators, and it does not provide for parental involvement in the early development&#13;
of the child. The Govermment has requested the Bank's assistance to provide low cost pre-&#13;
primary education services for the poor. The project will expand the CEFACEI system of non-&#13;
formal pre-primary education and provide it with child-centered developmental activities,&#13;
adequate educational materials, and practical training for the community educators (paras. 2.21-&#13;
2.33).&#13;
1.18 Unequal access to opportunities for the rural poor. Children in rural areas are often&#13;
forced to drop out of school, unless their parents can afford to send them to the nearest town for&#13;
the upper grades of basic education. While the Government considers it desirable for all children&#13;
to complete the basic cycle, many are denied access because of poverty. The Government&#13;
operates a program of scholarships for lower secondary students through IFARHU, and has&#13;
agreed to establish a new budget line for scholarships entirely targeted to the poor according to&#13;
the project's criteria. Thus 3,500 scholarships, in addition to the current 9,500, each one for a&#13;
three-year term, will be awarded every year (paras. 2.14-2.16).&#13;
1.19  Institutional weaknesses. The MOE has an adequate institutional structure for&#13;
administration and supervision of the public school system, at the central, provincial and district&#13;
levels. However, its capacity for information management, planning and policy-making is poor.&#13;
A proposed reform of the education system has been in preparation since 1979, when a&#13;
Commission was created for that purpose by the National Assembly. Last June 1995, the&#13;
National Assembly passed the Education Law which would: (a) reinforce MOE's role in defining&#13;
educational policy; (b) create an advisory body to the MOE, composed of representatives of&#13;
parents, the Catholic church, MOE and the teachers union; (c) extend provision of free education&#13;
to two years of pre-primary school; and, (d) provide a framework for strengthening the role of the&#13;
community in education and decentralizing some of the MOE's functions. These objectives are&#13;
fully consistent with the Government's policy positions as reflected in the Bank's sector report&#13;
(Report No. 13701-PAN, March 17, 1995), discussed in May 1995. The Government has&#13;
requested the Bank's assistance in strengthening its planning and policy-making capacity by&#13;
financing a series of policy studies to support the medium- and long-term reforms (paras. 2.34 and&#13;
2.35). It also plans to improve information management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
1.20 Dilapidated infrastructure. Primary school infrastructure compares favorably with that&#13;
of many other Latin American countries, but maintenance has been neglected. At the primary&#13;
level, about 350 classrooms are severely deteriorated and need to be replaced. About 1,700&#13;
classrooms need varying degrees of repair or rehabilitation (para. 2.20).&#13;
(3) Government Strategy&#13;
1.21 The development goals of the Government of Panama are a globally integrated economy&#13;
and a more equitable society, driven by sustainable private sector growth. The new&#13;
Administration's economic program, "Public Policies for Social Development with Economic&#13;
Efficiency", focuses on: (1) private sector development and employment creation; (2) fiscal&#13;
adjustment and public sector modernization; (3) poverty alleviation and human resources&#13;
development; and (4) environmental conservation.&#13;
1.22 Consistent with the econonic program, the Government's strategy for mitigating poverty&#13;
and inequality consists of four chief elements. The first is the introduction of conditions that will&#13;
revive sustainable growth. In this context, the economic program emphasizes reform policies that&#13;
will mitigate the bias against employment creation and reduce the high cost of the consumption&#13;
basket. In addition, the incentive framework is being altered to encourage increased agricultural&#13;
production and employment opportunities in the countryside, where most of the poor are located.&#13;
The second facet is improving efficiency and equity in social expenditures, especially in education&#13;
and health, targeting subsidies to the most vulnerable groups. Third is the introduction of social&#13;
safety net mechanisms like the Social Emergency Fund (FES), for the financing of community-&#13;
generated projects which create employment and provide basic social services to the most&#13;
disadvantaged groups in society. The fourth is institutional modernization and capacity building&#13;
of the public sector for the efficient use of public resources.&#13;
1.23 The Government's strategy for the education sector assigns top priority to basic education&#13;
and to ensuring equitable access for the poor to the fill benefits of education. In line with these&#13;
priorities, the short-term strategy calls for providing opportunities for poor children in the rural&#13;
and urban marginal areas to receive quality educational services, to achieve effective learning, and&#13;
to complete the nine years of the basic cycle. For the same purpose, the Government has decided&#13;
to extend access for the poor to pre-school education, in order to enhance their readiness and&#13;
increase their success in basic education, thus reducing grade repetition and promoting efficiency&#13;
of educational investments. The project addresses these Government concerns through the&#13;
reorientation of the scholarship program, the teacher training and textbook programs, and the pre-&#13;
primary education program (Annex 3).&#13;
1.24 In the longer term, the Government is contemplating deeper reforms of the education&#13;
system involving more equitable financing of educational costs, more active participation of&#13;
parents and NGOs in the management and financing of the schools, updating the basic education&#13;
curriculum to make it more relevant to the needs of society and the demands of the economy, and&#13;
developing MOE's institutional capacity for planning and policy-making. The project would&#13;
support these long term goals by: (a) financing studies to support the long-term policy decisions,&#13;
(b) providing technical assistance for the design and implementation of a Management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
Information System and, (c) providing technical assistance for the design and implementation of a&#13;
Student Assessment System.&#13;
C. Lessons Learned and Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
(1) Lessons Learned&#13;
1.25  Project Design. Successful education projects in Latin America have been characterized&#13;
by simplicity and clarity in design. As this is the first Bank loan to the education sector in&#13;
Panama, it is particularly important that project components be well-focused. The objectives of&#13;
each component should be as independent and measurable as possible, with explicit timetables for&#13;
key actions. These lessons have guided the establishment of the project components and the&#13;
monitoring indicators of this project. The project focuses mainly on basic education comprising&#13;
pre-primary, primary and lower secondary education.&#13;
1.26 Targeting. The use of poverty indexes has been proven effective in focusing investments&#13;
on the poor. However, when a poverty index classifies geographical areas too broadly, such as&#13;
states or provinces, pockets with highly uneven poverty levels are created. Therefore, the current&#13;
project refined the poverty index, which originally classified districts by poverty level, so that it&#13;
can classify the corregimientos by poverty levels.&#13;
1.27 Pre-Primary School. Research and Bank operations have shown that kindergarten and&#13;
early childhood development programs can improve school readiness, lower repetition and drop&#13;
out rates and improve academic performance at higher levels of education. Disadvantaged groups&#13;
(rural children and children from families with low socioeconomic status) have the most to gain&#13;
from such programs. Reaching the home environment and encouraging parental involvement also&#13;
appear to strengthen the impact of the interventions. The proposed project would expand the&#13;
informal CEFACEI model (community-administered pre-primary centers staffed by apromotora)&#13;
in areas of dense population and train rural mothers to stimulate their pre-primary children in&#13;
areas of socialization and pre-school learning. The project will also finance the production and&#13;
broadcasting of radio programs to address parents and community educators about child rearing&#13;
practices. As these activities indicate, the project would focus exclusively on disadvantaged&#13;
groups and involve parents.&#13;
1.28 Textbooks and Instructional Materials. Experience has shown that well-designed&#13;
textbooks play an important complementary role in improving student's academic achievement.&#13;
The proposed project would therefore provide textbooks in four subjects for the poorest 41&#13;
pereent of students at the primary and lower secondary levels who have no access to textbooks,&#13;
as well as teacher guides to accompany the texts. In Mexico and other countries, classroom&#13;
libraries consisting of carefully selected titles have proven to be an effective learning tool,&#13;
particularly in the multigrade environment. The proposed project would therefore provide a small&#13;
library of 30 carefully selected titles (including dictionaries, atlases, textbooks and storybooks) to&#13;
all primary classrooms in the country. Finally, experience has shown that the provision of&#13;
instructional materials (such as pencils, crayons, paper and games), and teacher training in the use&#13;
of these materials, leads to more active learning and more productive use of the teacher's time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
The proposed project would therefore provide a package of essential instructional materials to all&#13;
of the new and existing CEPACEIs, to enhance the quality of pre-primary education.&#13;
1.29 Monitoring and Evaluation. Experience in Latin America has shown that the viability&#13;
and sustainability of student achievement improvements depends in large part on the&#13;
Government's monitoring and assessment capacity. As in most developing countries, official&#13;
educational achievement data collection is almost non-existent in Panama. The proposed project&#13;
would create an Education Assessment System to provide the necessary information for&#13;
improving the overall quality of the education system. Due to its inherently controversial nature,&#13;
the establishment of such a system requires strong institutional and public support; the proposed&#13;
project would address this issue by incorporating teacher training and a publicity campaign for the&#13;
evaluation program. In addition to supplying the data necessary to assess systemic weaknesses,&#13;
the system will permit an assessment of project impact. Scores in year one will reflect achievement&#13;
levels without project inputs, and the scores in year five will reflect achievement levels with&#13;
project inputs.&#13;
1.30   Sustainability. Both the Government's ability to continue financing recurrent costs and&#13;
the MOE capacity to manage change have determnined the sustainability of project benefits. The&#13;
proposed project addresses both of these issues by: (a) adhering to a simple project design, which&#13;
improves the allocation and use of existing educational resources; (b) educating the public about&#13;
the importance of different project components; (c) relying on community participation, most&#13;
specifically for the expansion of rural pre-primary education; (d) expanding enrollment through&#13;
the intensive use of existing educational facilities and reorienting the scholarship program toward&#13;
lower income groups; and (e) strengthening the Ministry of Education's supervisory capacity.&#13;
(2) Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.31  The Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy for Panama, discussed by the Board on&#13;
February 7, 1995, with the Panama Rural Health Project, adopts a selective strategy focused on&#13;
reviving sustainable growth and poverty alleviation. In human resource development, the Bank's&#13;
priorities are to expand coverage and improve the quality of basic education. The strategy calls&#13;
for a two-pronged approach. The ongoing Economic Recovery Loan would be the key&#13;
instrument to promote restoration of a viable medium-term fiscal framework and elimination of&#13;
policy distortions required to mount an efficacious poverty alleviation strategy. The lending&#13;
program should be devoted to direct interventions in support of poverty alleviation and human&#13;
resources development. The Bank recently approved a loan to support a Rural Health Project&#13;
(Loan 3841-PA) which provides for health care and nutrition supplementation for children and&#13;
mothers in the same disadvantaged groups targeted by the pre-primary component of the&#13;
proposed project. The project is fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy and the&#13;
Bank's policy objectives. It will focus on poverty alleviation by providing students in the most&#13;
depressed areas of the country with essential educational inputs like textbooks and other learning&#13;
materials, and access to the benefits of pre-primary and basic education. In doing so, the project&#13;
will enhance the efficiency of the basic education system and increase the effectiveness of public&#13;
expenditures on education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
2. TIHE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Concept and Objectives&#13;
2.1   The objectives of the project are to: (a) improve the quality of basic education in the&#13;
borrower's territory; (b) improve equity of access to preschool education and basic education for&#13;
children in rural and poor urban areas; (c) expand the coverage of pre-school education through&#13;
community operated non-formal administrative models; and (d) strengthen the planning, financial,&#13;
supervision and policy-making capacity of MOE.&#13;
B. Project Target Areas&#13;
2.2   In order to compensate for poorer children's disadvantages in terms of access to better quality&#13;
education, the project will focus on corregimientos with the highest levels of poverty according to&#13;
representative indicators: poor housing conditions, less access to educational benefits, and nutritional&#13;
deficiencies. The percentage of indigenous population, as well as poverty-prone, overcrowded urban&#13;
areas, has been taken into consideration for targeting.&#13;
2.3   Corregimientos were chosen as targeting units so that project interventions can have the&#13;
maximum effect in poor areas. Targeting, through use of a poverty index, is critical to achieving&#13;
equity objectives. The project will target 185 corregimientos out of the 510, distributed over the&#13;
67 districts and covering 41 percent of the school population from grades 1 to 9 (Annex 4). An&#13;
effort will be made to update the poverty index based on outcomes of a planned Living Standards&#13;
Measurement Study to be supported by the Bank.&#13;
2.4   Among the 32 poorest corregimientos is the country's most populous (Belisario Porras),&#13;
an extremely disadvantaged zone on the outskirts of Panama City. However, 50 percent of the&#13;
school-aged basic education population lives in the first 238 corregimientos on the list (47 percent&#13;
of the total number of corregimientos). As a result, a large number of sparsely populated rural&#13;
corregimientos, as well as the most disadvantaged urban population centers, hold top priority&#13;
positions. These also include all corregimientos with a significant proportion of indigenous&#13;
inhabitants.&#13;
C. Project Components&#13;
2.5   The project has been organized into three components as follows:&#13;
(a) Improvement of Quality of, and Expansion of Access to, Primary and Lower&#13;
Secondary Education (US$ 44.41 million or 77 percent of total project costs) would include:&#13;
(i) the provision of training, with an emphasis on multigrade teaching techniques, for primary&#13;
education teachers; (ii) the provision of textbooks, activity cards for students in multigrade&#13;
classes, supplies and educational and instructional materials for basic education; (iii) redesign of&#13;
the scholarship program for primary and secondary education; (iv) development and&#13;
implementation of a student assessment system for basic education; and, (v) rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of primary schools and development and carrying out of a pilot program providing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
for community participation in the rehabilitation and maintenance of schools for Primary&#13;
Education.&#13;
(b) Expansion of non-formal pre-school education (US$ 5.69 million or 10 percent)&#13;
would include: (i) the expansion of pre-school education coverage through community-operated&#13;
non-formal administrative models through, inter alia: (a) the strengthening of the Borrower's&#13;
program for community and family centers and (b) the implementation of a pilot program for the&#13;
training of the mothers in child development; and (ii) development of a public education program&#13;
through mass media to reinforce the training of volunteers and parents on issues concerning pre-&#13;
school education.&#13;
(c) Institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Education (US$ 7.90 million or 13&#13;
percent) would include: (i) strengthening of the planning, financial, supervision and policy-&#13;
making capacity of MOE; (ii) development and implementation of a Management Information&#13;
System (MIS) for MOE; and (iii) administration, monitoring, evaluation and auditing of the&#13;
project.&#13;
D. Project Description&#13;
(1) Component 1 - Improvement of Quality of, and Expansion of Access to, Primary and&#13;
Lower Secondary Education (US$ 44.4 million or 77 percent of total project costs).&#13;
2.6   The objective of this component is to assist the Government in improving the quality and&#13;
equity of basic education by providing textbooks and teaching materials for the poor and&#13;
rehabilitating infrastructure where necessary. In addition, it will provide in-service teacher&#13;
training in multigrade techniques, and reorient the existing scholarship program to target poor&#13;
students. These improvements will: (a) help reduce the inequalities in the content and quality of&#13;
public education; and (b) expand access to secondary school for the disadvantaged.&#13;
2.7   Subcomponent 1A: In-service Teacher Training (US$ 2.52 million). All multigrade&#13;
teachers, about 3,800, will receive training in multigrade methodology and the use of classroom&#13;
libraries and activity cards. The training offered seeks to counteract the limitations or lack of training&#13;
of teachers working with more than one grade level simultaneously and to enhance teachers' capacity&#13;
to make good use of learning materials and school libraries. A set of technical materials and teaching&#13;
activities will be prepared to contribute to the training of teachers handling several grade levels at the&#13;
same time; in the optimum use of activity cards and classroom libraries; in effective distribution of&#13;
available time; in better use of school and non-school space; in the use of strategies that include&#13;
community members in educational and curricular efforts; and in the use of active techniques and the&#13;
development of varied activities that help students to learn independently.&#13;
2.8   The teaching function of provincial and national supervisors will be consolidated to ensure&#13;
training as well as guidance and monitoring of daily practices, in order to institutionalize the&#13;
proposed actions. A group of 7 national supervisors and 148 provincial supervisors will form the&#13;
technical group in charge of training and monitoring responsibilities of about 3,800 teachers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
2.9   Two courses will be given in two phases: an intensive course during the vacation period,&#13;
with 30 classroom hours and 15 hours outside the classroom, plus a feedback session on the sixth&#13;
day; and a follow-up course comprised of seven Saturday sessions during the school year, six&#13;
classroom hours each session. These courses will be mandatory for supervisors and active&#13;
teachers. Each educator will participate in an additional, optional course, based on demand. The&#13;
multigrade teaching course will also be given to future teachers before they graduate from teacher&#13;
training. The mandatory courses will be: multigrade, teaching methods for specific subject&#13;
matters and a third course, to be determined according to specific needs. Efforts will also be&#13;
developed to strengthen group working techniques, specifically the preparation and&#13;
implementation of activity charts, resources and basic teaching materials (experience charts, felt&#13;
boards, numbers box, flash cards, pocket charts, logic blocks, etc.).&#13;
2.10  A specific workshop will be offered to 80 teachers on the preparation of activity cards to&#13;
help children construct their own individual and/or group learning program and to collect a set of&#13;
cards that can later be printed and distributed to all multigrade teachers. Participants will be&#13;
selected by provinces among multigrade-class teachers who have demonstrated relevant abilities&#13;
and skills. A library course will also be given to multigrade-class teachers and to lower secondary&#13;
school teachers. To supplement this training course, classroom research and reading&#13;
encouragement will also be planned (Annex 5).&#13;
2.11   Subcomponent IB: Provision of Textbooks and Teaching Materials for the Poor&#13;
(US$ 5.67 million). Textbooks and classroom libraries will be provided under the project.&#13;
Forty-one percent of all primary and lower secondary students will be provided with textbooks in&#13;
Spanish, mathematics, social studies and science at the rate of one per student. Only mathematics&#13;
and reading-writing textbooks will be supplied to the first two grades. After third grade, science and&#13;
social studies texts will also be included. Beneficiaries will be students from the poorest&#13;
corregimientos, as determined by the poverty index created for the project. Materials will be&#13;
school property on loan to the students. (Annex 4). Classroom libraries (containing reading and&#13;
reference books) will be delivered to primary and lower secondary schools of the targeted&#13;
corregimientos. All multigrade schools in the country will be provided with textbooks for the&#13;
students and classroom libraries.&#13;
2.12  Books and educational materials to be supplied to schools will be purchased on the&#13;
domestic and international markets. They will be evaluated to select those that best meet selection&#13;
criteria and to determine the changes that winning publishers should introduce in the special&#13;
versions to be distributed under the plan. Under the framework of the Project, the committee&#13;
staffs will receive training in textbook evaluation.&#13;
2.13   Activity cards guide the student in personal work and group exercises, and teach him/her&#13;
to consult the classroom library and conduct self-evaluations. Each classroom will also be&#13;
provided with a set twice during the life of the project (Annex 6).&#13;
2.14 Subcomponent 1C: Reorientation of the Scholarship Program (US$ 12.58 million).&#13;
IFARHU will establish a new budget line for scholarships entirely targeted to the poor according&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
to the project's criteria. Thus, 3,500 additional scholarships, to the current 9,500, each one for a&#13;
three-year term, will be awarded per year. During negotiatioins MOE provided the document&#13;
reflecting the commitment toward reorientation of the criteria to assign scholarships.&#13;
2.15   The majority of IFARHU's scholarships have been awarded only on the basis of academic&#13;
performance criteria (36 percent of the scholarships go to the best students and 42 percent are&#13;
awarded through a combined index in which poverty is not heavily weighted). In 1994 IFARHU&#13;
gave about 1,500 scholarships to primary students and about 8,000 scholarships to secondary&#13;
students. Scholarships for secondary students are usually given to students already registered in a&#13;
school. This modality of operation does not provide adequate incentives for sixth-grade students&#13;
in the poorest corregimientos, who are the most likely to drop out. It must be noted that only&#13;
151 corregimientos of the 510 in the country have secondary schools. Since the scholarships are&#13;
given to those who have already decided to continue schooling, the program is failing to deter&#13;
drop out. Under the project, 800 new scholarships of US$ 315 each will be awarded every year,&#13;
targeted to sixth-grade students in the corregimientos of the project. The scholarship will cover&#13;
living expenses for the student, who must relocate in order to attend a lower-secondary school.&#13;
The program will be advertised in schools before the end of the school year, in order to deter&#13;
post-primary drop out.&#13;
2.16  Under the project, IFARHU will also award about 2,700 new primary school scholarships&#13;
per year targeted to the corregimientos under the project. Again, the objective is to target the&#13;
students most likely to drop out due to poverty. The main criteria for selection will be that the&#13;
students live in the selected corregimientos. For primary and secondary scholarships, girls will be&#13;
given a share no less than 60 percent of the total amount. This will help to reduce the inequalities&#13;
in female enrollment in the poorest corregimientos (see paragraph 1.7). This subcomponent will&#13;
be financed entirely with resources from counterpart funding.&#13;
2.17  Subcomponent 1D: Development of Student Assessment System  (US$ 2.29 million).&#13;
Achievement tests will be prepared, validated and administered for the four basic subjects:&#13;
Spanish, mathematics, natural sciences and social sciences. Starting in 1996, these tests will be&#13;
administered to a random nation-wide sampling of 10 percent of third and sixth grade students in&#13;
primary school and of ninth and twelfth grade students in secondary school. In even years testing&#13;
will be administered to third and ninth grade students, and in odd years to sixth and twelfth grade&#13;
students. The results of achievement tests and social and emotional development tests will be&#13;
used by students, teachers and parents to improve curricular implementation. The assessment will&#13;
be carried out annually starting in 1996, with samples from 30 schools from all of the country's&#13;
provinces.&#13;
2.18  A test of school readiness in terms of cognitive, emotional and psychomotor skills will be&#13;
developed and validated for children entering the first grade of primary school. This test will be&#13;
administered to a stratified random sample of 5 percent of children entering first grade, beginning&#13;
in 1998. The data obtained will be used to assess current preschool education programs and&#13;
those financed by the Basic Education Project. Beginning in 1999, tests will be developed and&#13;
validated to measure social and emotional variables that complement the assessment of students'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
achievements in primary and secondary schools. These tests will be administered to the same&#13;
sampling of students who take the achievement tests.&#13;
2.19  In order to better understand the factors that affect students' academic achievement,&#13;
studies will be performed to correlate the contextual variables of the student, teacher, school and&#13;
community with the outcomes of achievement and social and emotional development tests. This&#13;
research will use surveys and interviews that will be administered in parallel with achievement&#13;
tests, beginning in 1996. A system to assess Educational Quality provides data that should be&#13;
used to provide feedback on the educational system, thereby indicating any failures that may be&#13;
found, and to improve education. It is therefore important to ensure that the data produced are&#13;
being properly disseminated and are having a positive effect on the educational system. This work&#13;
will be performed beginning in 1997 and each year thereafter (Annex 7).&#13;
2.20 Subcomponent lE: Rehabilitation of Educational Infrastructure (US$ 21.34&#13;
million). Classroom repairs will constitute the bulk of the project work, in addition to the repair&#13;
of existing complementary rooms. About 350 severely deteriorated classrooms in primary schools&#13;
will be replaced by new ones. It is estimated that about 1,700 primary classrooms will be repaired.&#13;
A pilot program for school rehabilitation and maintenance under community responsibility will&#13;
also be financed for some 15 schools. The subcomponent includes provision and maintenance of&#13;
school furniture. The subcomponent will be executed by the Social Emergency Fund (FES) under&#13;
contract with the MOE. The FES is a Government agency, under the direct authority of the&#13;
Ministry of the Presidency. The institution was created in May 1990. In January 1993, FES was&#13;
given indefinite tenure. The largest share of FES spending has gone to projects that include&#13;
rehabilitation of schools, medical facilities and water and sanitation. It has previous experience in&#13;
promoting community involvement. The contract will be signed as a condition for effectiveness&#13;
(para. 6.2(e)). Priorities will be set by the Ministry and resources will be transferred according to&#13;
schedules for the completion of the works.&#13;
(2) Component 2 - Expansion of Non-Formal Pre-School Education (US$ 5.69 million or&#13;
10 percent).&#13;
2.21  This component aims to: i) expand coverage of non-formal pre-school education among&#13;
the poor to increase national coverage from 45.5 percent to nearly 75.0 percent (from 26,000 to&#13;
43,000 for five year-olds) and ii) improve the quality of non-formal pre-school education.&#13;
Coverage expansion will be based primarily on the CEFACEI (Family and Community Education&#13;
Center) model. At the same time, a pilot mother-to-mother program for rural areas of scattered&#13;
population will also be developed (Annex 8).&#13;
2.22  Subcomponent 2A: The CEFACEI Program  (US$ 5.26 million).&#13;
The project aims to open 400 new CEFACEIs, and serve approximately 20,000 pre-primary-age&#13;
children over the life of the project. A pilot Mother-to-Mother program will also be implemented,&#13;
to benefit approximately 1,800 pre-primary-age children in dispersed, rural communities. The&#13;
quality of non-formal pre-school education will be improved through intensive training of MOE&#13;
supervisors and promotoras, the distribution of specially designed manuals for promotoras,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
children and parents, and the transmission of radio programs to reinforce the program and&#13;
encourage healthy child rearing practices.&#13;
2.23  A pyramid strategy will be developed for training and supervision of the program, to&#13;
facilitate the full involvement of the national, regional, provincial and local levels. The national&#13;
team will be trained by national and international technical assistance to design the manuals for&#13;
trainers and promotoras (one manual for trainers, one for promotoras, one for parents and one for&#13;
each child). The national team will train pre-school supervisors at the provincial level. Both teams&#13;
share the responsibility for conducting meetings in each community targeted by the project, to&#13;
convey the importance of pre-school education to parents, and form a local CEFACEI Parents'&#13;
Association.&#13;
2.24 The Parents' Association will be responsible for: i) finding a location for the CEFACEI;&#13;
ii) collaborating in the opening and functioning of the CEFACEI; iii) selecting the promotora&#13;
according to a profile specified by the Directorate of Initial Education; and iv) paying the&#13;
promotoras with the funds received from MOE every three months, the amount determined by&#13;
the number of children attending the CEFACEI. Thepromotora will be paid US$90 per child per&#13;
year. Implemented gradually, the program will open 100 new CEFACEIs per year. The financial&#13;
resources to pay the promotoras will be provided by the Government as counterpart funds to the&#13;
Bank loan. The financial resources will be transferred from the Ministry to each Parents'&#13;
Associations. For that purpose, each Association must register at the MOE to obtain legal&#13;
permission to receive funds and pay the promotoras.&#13;
2.25  Subcomponent 2B: Mother-to-Mother Pilot (US$ 0.43 million).&#13;
In rural areas with scattered population mothers will be encouraged to establish teams, under the&#13;
guidance of a Mother-Leader, and with the help of educational material and radio programs to&#13;
improve their child-rearing practices. Training of the mother-leaders will be the responsibility of&#13;
the supervisors and pre-primary education specialists in each provincial office of MOE. Ten&#13;
regional MOE supervisors will be trained for 10 days in year 1 and ten days in year 2 of the&#13;
project. They will train the 120 mother-leaders, chosen by the participating mothers, for seven&#13;
days each. Thirty mother-leaders will be trained each year. Each in turn will train 10 mothers on&#13;
a bi-weekly basis. It is estimated that each participating mother is raising an average of 2&#13;
children. Therefore, 2,400 children will benefit directly from the project.&#13;
2.26  As in the case of the CEFACEIs, a pyramid strategy will be developed for training and&#13;
supervision of the program, to facilitate the full involvement of the national, regional, provincial&#13;
and local levels. Interested communities will then select a woman to be trained as a mother leader.&#13;
Each supervisor will work with a group of about 15 mother leaders throughout their two-year&#13;
tenure. He/she will give an initial six-day training workshop, focusing on the following topics: i)&#13;
the circumstances of childhood in rural areas and in particular, in each community where the&#13;
mother leaders reside; ii) group dynamics; and iii) analysis of the Mother-to-Mother Program,&#13;
including materials and implementation. The supervisor will supplement this initial training with&#13;
four more three-day workshops over the two-year period, and periodic monitoring of the progress&#13;
of each mother leader.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
2.27 Each participating mother will be instructed in a series of thematic units and provided with&#13;
a set of manuals for use with her children. Implementation of the Mother-to-Mother Program will&#13;
be gradual, concentrating efforts in only two provinces: Veraguas and Chiriqui.&#13;
2.28  Mother-leaders will be paid on a per mother-participant basis, that is, they will receive&#13;
US$ 32 per year for each participating mother they train in bi-weekly meetings over a ten-month&#13;
period. Funds to pay the mother-leaders will be transferred from the central office of MOE to the&#13;
bank accounts of the regional MOE offices. MOE's supervisors will monitor the number of&#13;
mothers being taught, in order to ensure appropriate payment of the mother-leaders. The&#13;
financial resources to pay the mother-leaders will be provided by the Government as counterpart&#13;
funding for the Bank loan.&#13;
2.29  The current curriculum will be revised to stress simple problem-solving, self-care and&#13;
school readiness skills. The emphasis will be on an open, flexible curriculum focused on the child&#13;
with parental participation. The strategy for producing a simple core curriculum will be to focus&#13;
on making each concept operational in training manuals. Two types of manuals will be produced:&#13;
manuals to train the promotoras in the use of the new curriculum, and manuals for the promotoras&#13;
to use in teaching. The manuals will be adapted to address rural mother-leaders and mothers&#13;
participating in the program, both of which have very little formal education. The adapted manual&#13;
will be a simplified, shorter version, relying heavily on drawings and visual messages. Thus, a&#13;
total of four manuals will be produced. A special working group will be formed within the&#13;
Directorate of Initial Education to produce the manuals with national and international technical&#13;
assistance. The project will finance the technical assistance to produce the manuals.&#13;
2.30 Radio Programs. The current pre-primary programs, both formal and CEFACEI, fail to&#13;
involve parents, which is crucial, as the dominant share of intelligence develops in early childhood.&#13;
Radio programs are an alternative to involve parents and enhance their ability to create learning&#13;
situations for their children, and it does it in a simple and appealing way. Radio programs also&#13;
provide promotoras and mother-leaders with effective reinforcement of the training and to the&#13;
written educational materials they will receive. Radio is accessible to large numbers of the poor.&#13;
Radio is part of their daily life, especially in remote areas. Radio is used in Panama to help&#13;
families to communicate messages, for example, messages from travelers from remote rural areas&#13;
to relatives in the towns. Radio is not as expensive as other media, like TV. Another advantage&#13;
is the fact that the country, as almost all countries, has human resources acquainted with the&#13;
production of messages for radio.&#13;
2.31   A set of 40 radio programs of 5-7 minutes each will be produced by a team of local and&#13;
international consultants during the first and second year of the project. The content of the&#13;
programs will be mainly instructions to perform a set of activities geared toward selected&#13;
objectives of early childhood development.&#13;
2.32  Local radio stations from the provinces are willing to broadcast the programs. It is&#13;
expected that some 11 small radio stations will participate in the project. Most of the stations will&#13;
provide the service free of charge. Each program will be broadcast twice every week and, at the&#13;
end of the 40th week they will be broadcast again.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
2.33  Integration of Health. Nutrition and Education Services. All of the pre-school children&#13;
who will benefit from the project will be eligible to receive the nutrition and health services&#13;
provided under the Rural Health Project financed by the Bank (Loan 3841-PA). This Project&#13;
provides nutrition counseling, health monitoring and supplemental feeding in case of malnutrition&#13;
diagnosed at the community level. To accomplish these objectives a health promoter addresses&#13;
parents and other community members involved in educating children. The CEFACEI&#13;
promotoras, the children and their parents will benefit from the counseling and the supplemental&#13;
feeding in cases of diagnosed malnutrition.&#13;
(3) Component 3 - Institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Education (US$ 7.9&#13;
million or 13 percent).&#13;
2.34  Subcomponent 3A: Development of Planning and Policy-Making Capacity (US$&#13;
0.34 million). The project will provide technical and financial assistance to MOE in order to&#13;
strengthen planning and policy-making capacity. Studies and technical assistance related to&#13;
institutional and managerial reform will be financed, specifically addressing: (a) how to foster&#13;
community participation; (b) optimization of budget resource allocation among the different levels&#13;
of education and, (c) delegation of MOE functions to provincial offices. These studies and&#13;
technical assistance should help to shape the broad objectives of the new Education Law,&#13;
regarding community participation and decentralization, and should make recommnendations for a&#13;
more equitable distribution of resources, outline measures to improve internal efficiency, and&#13;
explore ways of raising additional revenue. The findings will be discussed with the Bank and in a&#13;
series of seminars in Panama, which will formn the basis for future policy decisions. The terms of&#13;
reference, including the dissemination methods, will be included in the Operations Manual. The&#13;
project finances the design and implementation of a social communication campaign to support&#13;
meeting the objectives of the project. Terms of reference will be included in the Operations&#13;
Manual.&#13;
2.35 Subcomponent 3B: Development of a Management Information System (MIS) (US$&#13;
5.21 million). This subcomponent will finance the design, testing and introduction of an MIS to&#13;
assist and improve sector planning and personnel management. The MIS will include: human&#13;
resources administration, budgeting, accounting, purchasing, warehouses inventories, education&#13;
statistics and school map. Technical assistance will be provided to strengthen the technical&#13;
capacity of the units in charge of statistics and personnel. The subcomponent will finance the&#13;
training of MOE staff for implementing the new procedures and using the software for each of the&#13;
main areas mentioned above. It will also finance the acquisition of computers and the&#13;
establishment of a network.&#13;

3.1    The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, is estimated at US$ 58&#13;
million equivalent, net of taxes, of which an estimated US$ 11.6 million (20 percent) is foreign&#13;
exchange (Annex 9). Investment costs are 67 percent of base costs and incremental recurrent&#13;
costs amount to 33 percent of base costs. Project costs were estimated at December 1995 price&#13;
levels and include physical contingencies of 10 percent for civil works and 5 percent for goods&#13;
and services. Price contingencies are based on a projected intemational inflation rate of 2.6&#13;
percent per year during the life of the project. These rates have been applied to both local and&#13;
foreign costs as Panama's currency is directly linked to the US dollar.&#13;
3.2    Estimated costs of equipment, furniture, textbooks and didactic materials are based on unit&#13;
prices of goods procured recently by MOE. Estimates for technical assistance and studies are&#13;
based on current rates for local and foreign experts. Cost estimates for training, and operating&#13;
costs are based on current costs or costing standards used by MOE. Estimated construction and&#13;
rehabilitation costs of schools throughout the country are based on current processes that derive&#13;
from periodic cost analyses for similar standards of construction in corresponding facilities.&#13;

Note: Due to rounding the nwnbers may not add up.&#13;
3.4    The Governrment of Panama has requested a single currency loan with standard&#13;
amortization term, grace period, and interest rate for a fixed-rate US dollar single currency loan&#13;
because: (a) The US dollar is the Panamanian tender and therefore use of the dollar would avoid&#13;
foreign exchange risk; (b) the fixed rate offers a longer term predictability vis-a-vis LIBOR.&#13;
Panama is eligible for single currency loans under the expanded SCL program. Including this&#13;
loan, Panama will have financed $35 million of its $180 million FY96-98 lending program on&#13;
single currency loans, within the SCL volume guidelines established by the Board.&#13;
3.5    Revolving Fund in Local Currency. A revolving fund would be opened in the name of the&#13;
project, with an initial deposit from the Government as its up-front participation to the project&#13;
financing. As a conditionfor effectiveness, MOE willprovide evidence that the revolvingfund&#13;
has been established and that the deposit of counterpartfunds in the amount of $250, 000 has&#13;
been made (para. 6.2(C)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
C Incremental Recurrent Expenditures and Project Sustalnability&#13;
3.6   During the implementation period, the project will add an average of about USS 1.3&#13;
million per year to the recurrent cost budget of MOE. These incremental recurrent costs would&#13;
be generated mainly by fees for promotoras and rural preschool children, operation and&#13;
maintenance of infrastructure, equipment furniture, and office supplies. Recurrent costs generated&#13;
by scholarships for rural poor students will be covered by the education security fund, Seguro&#13;
Educativo. The incremental recurrent costs would be financed by the Government. The&#13;
Recurrent costs under the project, in December 1995 US dollars, are estimated as follows:&#13;
3.7   The effect of the recurrent costs on MOE's budget is small and could be easily absorbed by&#13;
MOE. Based on MOE's ordinary budget for 1995 (excluding investments and the Seguro&#13;
Educativo) of about USS214.6 million, and the forecast budget increments equivalent, at least, to&#13;
the forecast annual growth of GDP (3 percent in 1996, 3.5 percent form 1997 through 2000),&#13;
impact of these costs on the MOE ordinary budget would be 0.1 percent, 0.4 percent, 0.5 percent,&#13;
0.7 percent, 0.8 percent, for the successive years of implementation of the project. After project&#13;
implementation, 2001-2010, a yearly average of recurrent costs generated by the project are&#13;
estimated at US$2 million. This figure amounts to 0.7 percent of the MOEs recurrent cost&#13;
budget (Annex 10). With economic growth forecast to grow at a minimum of 3.5 percent&#13;
annually over the medium-term, the project should not present an undue financial burden on the&#13;
Governfment.&#13;

3.8   The impact of the proposed project on total educational expenditures and the ability of the&#13;
MOE to finance and sustain the resulting increase in recurrent costs was carefully discussed with&#13;
the Government during appraisaL At negotiations the Government agreed to include: () in&#13;
MOE's budget separate lines coveringfeesfor pre-primary community educators (promotoras&#13;
and madres ifderes) and operating and maintenance costs of the schools included under the&#13;
project; and (ii) in IFARHU's budget a separate line covering the scholarshipsfor Primary and&#13;
Lower Seconday students. As a conditionfor effectiveness, the Government will agree with the&#13;
World Bank to provide evidence that a budget line has been included in the Government 's 1996&#13;
budgetfor promotoras, scholarships, and operating and maintenance costs (para 6.2(b)).&#13;

ICB - International Competitive Bidding; NCB - National Competitive Bidding.&#13;
I      Includes US$5.0 million equivalent, for lump sum, fixed-priced contracts for works valued less than US&#13;
250,000, to be awarded on a national shopping basis, and US$2.1 million equivalent for direct contracting&#13;
for works valued less than USS 50,000 in scattered and distant rural areas.&#13;
2      Shopping procedure, includes $870,00 school furniture, $40,000 office equipment, $60,000 vehicles, and&#13;
direct contracting $30,000.&#13;
3      Transportation and per diem for trainees. Not subject to procurement.&#13;
4      Includes USS 3.0 million equivalent for textbooks and teachers' guides and US$ 2.1 million equivalent for&#13;
classroom library books to be procured following ICB 2-stage procedures.&#13;
Printing services.&#13;
Printing services through shopping procedures.&#13;
7      Includes contracts for short and long-term consultants in PAU.&#13;
3.9    The project would include procurement of civil works for rehabilitation of school&#13;
infiastructure. The project would also finance the procurement of textbooks, teacher guides,&#13;
educational materials, training, school furniture, vehicles, and office and computing equipment.&#13;
Procurement of works and goods will be carried out according to the guidelines for procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits of January 1995. In addition, the project would finance&#13;
studies and technical assistance services. For the selection of consulting services the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
would follow the guidelines for use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers of August 1981.&#13;
As discussed below (para. 4.1), the PAU in the MOE will have overall responsibility for&#13;
procurement under the project and the unit's staff will include a suitably qualified Procurement&#13;
Officer (Annex 11) who will have specific responsibility for the preparation of standard bidding&#13;
documents and the implementation of procurement according to the Bank's guidelines and the&#13;
Operations Manual. In addition, for civil works MOE will enter into an agreement with the Social&#13;
Emergency Fund (FES), which also has the institutional capacity to ensure that all procurement of&#13;
smaller works is executed in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.&#13;
3.10 For the procurement of goods under ICB and ICB-2 stage, the Bank's SBDs of January&#13;
1995 will be used, with minimal changes acceptable to the Bank to address country- and project-&#13;
specific issues. For the procurement of works and printing services under national competitive&#13;
bidding (NCB), SBDs based on similar SBDs of the Bank for such procurement would be used,&#13;
with modifications as agreed with the Bank. For contracting of consulting firms, the Borrower&#13;
will use standard letters of invitation as agreed with the Bank and, as appropriate, the Bank's&#13;
standard forms of contract for Consultants of June 1995, for complex time-based assignments and&#13;
lump sum contracts. Small contracts with firms or individual consultants would be contracted&#13;
under standard short forms of contract to be agreed with the Bank. For carrying out procurement&#13;
activities, the project would include all relevant procedures in its Operational Manual. At&#13;
negotiations the MOE submitted a draft PA U Operational Manualfor Banik's review. As a&#13;
conditionfor effectiveness, the MOE would agree to put into effect the Operational Manual&#13;
(including all standard bidding documents) as agreed with the Bank (para. 6 2(d)).&#13;
3.11  Civil Works. Civil works contracts would consist mainly of repairs and substitution of&#13;
classrooms and rehabilitation of schools amounting to approximately US$ 18.7 million equivalent.&#13;
ICB is not expected but would be used when packages equal or exceed the equivalent of USS 1.5&#13;
million. Contracts for works would be packaged whenever possible in packages of more than&#13;
US$ 0.5 million equivalent and would be awarded following NCB procedures up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$ 11.6 million equivalent. For works valued at US$ 250,000 equivalent or less but&#13;
more than US$ 50,000 equivalent, lumpsum, fixed-price contracts will be awarded on the basis of&#13;
at least three quotations, up to an aggregate limit of US$ 5.0 million equivalent. For rehabilitation&#13;
or minor works in scattered, distant rural areas, direct contracting with local contractors may be&#13;
used for contracts valued under US$ 50,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate limit of US$ 2.1&#13;
million equivalent.&#13;
3.12  Goods and Equipment. The project would finance contracts for goods with a total value&#13;
of US$ 4.3 million equivalent. When possible, goods (including computer hardware and&#13;
software) would be packaged in contracts of at least US$ 250,000 equivalent, and be awarded&#13;
following ICB procedures. In the evaluation of bids under ICB, a margin of preference in&#13;
accordance with Appendix 2 of the Bank's Guidelines may be granted to domestic manufacturers.&#13;
Awards will be made by individual package or by groups of packages, depending on the&#13;
combination that produces the lowest total bid evaluated cost. Contracts for goods costing US$&#13;
50,000 or less would be procured by local or international shopping procedures on the basis of&#13;
price quotations from at least three qualified suppliers, up to aggregate amounts not to exceed: (i)&#13;
USS 870,000 equivalent in the case of goods (other than vehicles and computer hardware and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
software); (ii) US$ 60,000 equivalent in the case of vehicles; (iii) US$ 40,000 equivalent in the&#13;
case of computer hardware and software; (iv) US$ 600,000 equivalent in the case of printing&#13;
services. Vehicles will be purchased on the basis of price quotations from suppliers with service&#13;
and maintenance facilities in Panama. The request for quotations for these purchases should only&#13;
specify the type of vehicle and the performance requirements and not a particular vehicle&#13;
manufacturer. School furniture estimated to cost less than the equivalent of 2,000 per contract&#13;
and up to an aggregate of 30,000 equivalent or less may with the Bank's prior agreement be&#13;
procured under direct contracting.&#13;
3.13  Educational Materials. The project would finance about US$ 7.1 million of educational&#13;
materials. Separate tender packages of textbooks, teachers guides, classroom libraries and&#13;
printing services will be procured. Contracts for textbooks, teachers guides and classroom&#13;
libraries, with a total value of approximately US$ 5.1 million equivalent, would be awarded under&#13;
ICB two-stage bidding procedures in accordance with paragraph 2.6 of the Bank's Guidelines.&#13;
Bids for these materials will be called using bidding documents that describe the two-stage&#13;
procedure and are satisfactory to the Bank. At the first stage, the Borrower will invite unpriced&#13;
technical proposals on the basis of a conceptual design and technical specifications stating&#13;
minimum basic requirements. Samples of textbooks will be required with the technical proposal.&#13;
During the evaluation of these technical proposals, MOE will ask participating editors/publishers&#13;
for technical clarifications and will allow bidders to adjust their proposals to respond fully to the&#13;
requirements of the bidding documents. MOE will qualify those bidders whose proposals meet&#13;
the evaluation criteria or who are willing to modify their proposals to meet the final specifications.&#13;
At the second stage, bidding documents, amended as required to reflect understandings reached&#13;
with each of the bidders, will be issued to the qualified bidders, inviting them to submit final&#13;
priced proposals. The Borrower will award contracts by packages, on the basis of the criteria&#13;
stated in the bidding documents. Contracts for printing services for other educational and&#13;
assessment materials, valued at less than US$ 250,000 equivalent, may be awarded following&#13;
NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank up to an aggregate amount of US$ 1.1 million&#13;
equivalent.&#13;
Training, Technical Assistance and Studies&#13;
3.14  The project would finance approximately US$ 8.8 million equivalent to provide training,&#13;
technical assistance and studies. It would also finance contracts of short and long fixed-term&#13;
consultants in the PAU. MOE would employ consultants whose qualifications, experience and&#13;
terms of reference shall be satisfactory to the Bank. The project will finance cost of&#13;
transportation and per diem for participants in training and monitoring. During appraisal broad&#13;
terms of reference for training programs, technical assistance and studies to be financed under the&#13;
project were reviewed and agreed with MOE. For contracting of these services MOE would&#13;
prepare specific terms of reference for each consultancy and use the standard invitation packages&#13;
and contracts agreed with the Bank (per para. 3.10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
Costs Not Involving Procurement&#13;
3.15  Approximately US$ 22.1 million of project costs, or approximately 38.0 percent, would&#13;
not involve procurement and include fees for promotoras, mother-leaders (community educators),&#13;
scholarships for students and incremental operating costs financed by MOE and training costs&#13;
(transportation and per diem) financed by the Bank.&#13;
Review by the Bank&#13;
3.16  Prior review of procurement procedures and documentation by the Bank would be&#13;
required for all tender packages and related contracts under ICB, ICB-2 step and LIB procedures.&#13;
The Bank would also review the first two NCB tender packages and related contracts for civil&#13;
works and printing services, regardless of value, and works packages and related contracts valued&#13;
at US$ 500,000 equivalent or more. It is expected that this review would cover nearly 54 percent&#13;
of contracts by value. All other contracts would be subject to review (ex post) by Bank&#13;
supervision missions on the basis of random sampling. For these contracts, MOE will follow the&#13;
procedures stated in Appendix 1, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Bank's procurement guidelines. All&#13;
TORs for technical assistance and studies would be subject to ex-ante review by the Bank.&#13;
Documentation for contracts with consultants' firms valued at or above US$ 100,000 and for&#13;
individual consultants, valued at or above US$ 50,000, as well as those of a critical nature, sole&#13;
source contracts, and amendments raising values above these thresholds, would also be reviewed&#13;
ex-ante by the Bank. All supporting documentation for these contracts would be retained by the&#13;
PCU. During appraisal it was agreed that procedures for ex-ante review to be followed by&#13;
executing agencies would be incorporated in the Operational Manual.&#13;
Special Provisions in Procurement&#13;
3.17  Country Procurement Assessment. A November 1993 assessment by the Bank of&#13;
Panama's procurement procedures indicates that they are not fully compatible with the Bank's&#13;
procurement guidelines. At negotiations agreement was reached that the principles indicated&#13;
below would govern all procurement of goods and services (para. 6 1 (d)).&#13;

E. Disbursements&#13;
3.18   The proposed project would be implemented over a period of approximately 5 years and is&#13;
expected to be completed by June 30, 2001 and to close by December 30, 2001. The loan funds&#13;
would be disbursed as follows: civil works, 78 percent of expenditures for rehabilitation and&#13;
substitution; educational materials, office and computer equipment for the MIS, school furniture,&#13;
vehicles, printed materials and other goods, 100 percent of foreign expenditures, 100 percent of&#13;
local expenditures (ex-factory cost), and 95 percent of local expenditures for other items procured&#13;
locally; printing services, 100 percent of local expenditures. Proceeds of the loan would also be&#13;
disbursed for training, consultants, studies and technical assistance and fixed-term staff in PAU at&#13;
100 percent. Retroactive financing of up to US$3.0 million (8.6 percent of the total loan amount)&#13;
would be provided to help cover eligible expenditures made after February 1, 1996.&#13;
3.19   The Bank may require withdrawals from the Loan Account to be made on the basis of&#13;
statements of expenditure, under such terms and conditions as the Bank shall specify by notice to&#13;
the Borrower, for: (a) expenditures for goods, works, printing services, and consultants' services&#13;
under contracts costing less than the equivalent of: (i) $50,000 in the case of goods, $250,000 in&#13;
the case of printing services, and $500,000 in the case of works (except the first two contracts),&#13;
to be awarded pursuant to the provisions of NCB; (ii) $100,000 in the case of consulting firms'&#13;
services; and (iii) $50,000 in the case of individual consultants' services; and (b) payments made&#13;
for training activities provided under the project, such as: (i) the rental of training facilities; (ii)&#13;
transportation expenses of trainees and MOE staff to and from the training site and subsistence&#13;
expenses for such trainees and trainers; (iii) fellowships for training courses to be provided in the&#13;
Borrower's territory or abroad; and (iv) study tours in the Borrower's territory or abroad. SOEs&#13;
should contain information as agreed upon with the Bank and supporting documentation related&#13;
to SOEs would be retained by the PCU for periodic inspection by the Bank and external auditors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
3.20 A Special Account in US dollars with an initial deposit of US$ 2.0 million would be&#13;
established at the National Bank of Panama. The maximum authorized allocation would be US$&#13;
2.0 million after aggregate disbursements have reached US$ 5.0 million. The Special Account&#13;
should be replenished monthly and should be used for all transactions with a value of less than 20&#13;
percent of the amount advanced to the Special Account. Normal documentation requirements&#13;
apply, except that in addition, a copy of the bank statement from the institution holding the&#13;
account, detailing the transactions made and reconciled by the borrower, would accompany each&#13;
replenishment request.&#13;
F. Accounting and Auditing&#13;
3.21  MOE and FES will establish and maintain separate project accounts and records for&#13;
project expenditures. The PAU will maintain a consolidated account of all expenditures under the&#13;
project. These accounts, including accounts for subprojects administered by FES, will be audited&#13;
annually by independent auditors, in accordance with appropriate auditing principles, with terms&#13;
of reference approved by the Bank. The audit reports, which will include a separate opinion on&#13;
the adequacy of Statement of Expenditures and on the Special Account.&#13;
4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. Project Implementation and Management&#13;
4.1   The project will be under the general direction of MOE. The General Secretary has&#13;
overall responsibility for ensuring diligent, efficient and timely project implementation. MOE has&#13;
already appointed a Project Coordinator, to the Bank's satisfaction, for the Project Administration&#13;
Unit (PAU), who reports to the General Secretary. The PAU will be responsible for preparing,&#13;
monitoring and evaluating the implementation plan. In particular, the Government agreed at&#13;
negotiations that the PA U will: (i) conduct Annual Project Reviews, produce an annual project&#13;
implementation review report andprepare an annual implementation plan for the following&#13;
year, starting in July 1997; (ii) furnish to the Bank, during the month of August 1996, a budget&#13;
and an investment plan for, and the targets to be achieved in, the implementation of the project&#13;
in 1997 and exchange views with the Bank on said budget, plan and targets, by no later than&#13;
September 30, 1996; (iii) prepare a project implementation completion review report; and, (iv)&#13;
processing of documentation requiredfor the procurement of goods (other than furniture and&#13;
equipment for primary schools, which will be done by FES) and consultants' services under the&#13;
project and the disbursement of Loan proceeds (para. 6.1(e)). The PA U will be staffed with,&#13;
inter alia, a Project coordinator, a Project accountant and a procurement officer, all with&#13;
qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank (para. 6.1 ()). Under the DGE (Direccion&#13;
General de Educacion), the Curriculum Directorate (Direccion de Curriculo, DC) will implement&#13;
two subcomponents: Provision of Textbooks and Educational Materials for the Poor, and In-&#13;
service Teacher Training. The Education Assessment System will be the responsibility of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
General Directorate for Educational Planning (Direccion General de Planeamiento Educativo,&#13;
DGPE). Expansion of pre-primary coverage will be the responsibility of the Initial Education&#13;
Directorate (Direccion de Educacion Inicial, DEI) and the scholarship reorientation&#13;
subcomponent will be implemented by IFARHU, Institute for Training and Progress in Human&#13;
Resources (Instituto para la Formaci6n y Aprovechamiento de Recursos Humanos - LFARHU).&#13;
IFARHU, created in 1965, is an institute with patrimony under MOE's supervision, that&#13;
administers scholarship programs for the secondary and university levels. It has a well-trained,&#13;
experienced staff. The borrower shall enter into an agreement with IFARHU, satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank, which provides for the provision to IFARHU of the funds, facilities, services and other&#13;
resources required to enable IFARHU to carry out the scholarship reorientation subcomponent.&#13;
To assist in the construction, rehabilitation, equipment and furnishing of primary school&#13;
classrooms in the rural areas, MOE will enter into agreement with the FES. In existence for 4&#13;
years, FES has recently been restructured with technical assistance from IDB and UNDP. The&#13;
Bank's appraisal mission concluded that IFARHU and FES have adequate institutional capacity to&#13;
implement their respective subcomponents. Signing of the agreements between IFARHU and&#13;
MOE on the implementation of the scholarship reorientation subcomponent, and between FES&#13;
and MOE on the primary school rehabilitation and maintenance subcomponent, respectively,&#13;
would be a condition for effectiveness (para 6.2(e)).&#13;
B. Project Monitoring and Supervision&#13;
4.2   Project Monitoring. Outcome and Impact indicators and the Project Implementation&#13;
Schedule will guide project management, monitoring and supervision (Annexes 12, 14 and 15.).&#13;
4.3   Annual Progress and Investment Plan Review. The annual review to be prepared by&#13;
the PAU in July each year, starting in 1997 would focus on overall project implementation,&#13;
technical assistance, delivery of services (training, educational materials, infrastructure),&#13;
disbursement and procurement issues. As conditions for effectiveness, MOE will submit a&#13;
detailed project implementation plan for 1996 for all components (para. 6. 2(a)). At&#13;
negotiations, MOE agreed: (a) to produce an Annual Implementation Plan for the following&#13;
year starting July 1997 and an Annual Project Implementation Report, starting in July 1997.&#13;
The Annual Implementation Report will include cumulative information from the beginning of&#13;
the project; (b) to conduct annualproject reviews starting in July 1997. The reviews would: (i)&#13;
analyze the previousyear 's project performance based on an activity report and budget&#13;
allocation; and (ii) analyze the proposed subsequent year 's investment plan and budget,&#13;
including staffing, contracts, annual research plans and their TORs and schedules for delivery&#13;
of services (para. 6. 1(a));and (c) furnish to the Bank, during the month of August 1996, a budget&#13;
and an investment plan for, and the targets to be achieved in, the implementation of the project&#13;
in 1997 and exchange views with the Bank on said budget, plan and targets, by no later than&#13;
September 30, 1996 (para. 6.1(b)).&#13;
4.4   Mid-Term Review. The third annual review, in 1999, would be the mnid-term review and&#13;
it would assess project performance regarding output indicators (delivery of services) and process&#13;
indicators (critical tasks). It would assess the activities and information gathered in order to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
conduct the impact evaluation at the end of the fifth year of the project. At negotiations the&#13;
borrower agreed to conduct with the FES and the Bank, under terms of reference acceptable to&#13;
the Bank a mid-term review of the implementation of the project and its impact, prepare an&#13;
action plan acceptable to the Bank to incorporate lessons learnedfrom the review, and&#13;
implement it (para. 6. 1(c)).&#13;
4.5   Impact Evaluation. The following is the expected impact of the project on selected&#13;
quality, equity, efficiency and coverage indicators. The expected quality improvements are: (a)&#13;
increment on the levels of achievement in Spanish, Mathematics, Social Sciences and Natural&#13;
Sciences by 10-15 percent from the baseline to be established in 1996; (b) increment on time&#13;
spent on learning activities at school after delivering the project inputs; (c) changes in the quality&#13;
of interactions between mothers and children, as perceived by the mothers. The expected equity&#13;
improvements are: (a) a decrease in the gap between poorest and richest corregimientos in&#13;
repetition and dropout rates. Dropout rates in the poorest corregimientos are expected to&#13;
decrease from 6.2 to the current national average of 4.6. The expected improvement of efficiency&#13;
will be a decrease in the average number of years required to complete the basic education cycle&#13;
(1-9) from current 12.87 to 12 years. The expected pre-primary coverage improvement will be an&#13;
improvement from current 45 percent to 75 percent (Annex 12).&#13;
5. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benerits and Economic Returns&#13;
5.1   The main benefits of the project will be an increase in future earnings due to improved&#13;
productivity, especially for students from low-income family and rural areas. Furthermore, the&#13;
project would also produce benefits that would accrue to society at large beyond the project&#13;
beneficiaries which are difficult to quantify, but which would contribute to poverty alleviation,&#13;
especially in rural areas. The social internal rate of return (IRR) for the improvement of basic&#13;
education quality component (excluding scholarships) is 19%. Given the high percentage of the&#13;
IRR for this component, it is economically feasible and definitely justifiable to undertake the&#13;
project (Annex 13).&#13;
5.2   The savings from the preschool component are very encouraging. The annual average&#13;
cost per formal preschool child is US$288 based on the Ministry of Education's 1993 data. With&#13;
the CEFACEI program, the cost per child is only US$124. The project would provide preschool&#13;
education for 22,000 preschool-age children during the life of the project. The savings from&#13;
CEFACEI program is about US$3.5 million. With the mother-to-mother program, the cost per&#13;
child is US$243. This program would benefit 3,000 children in rural areas, thus, the savings from&#13;
this program is US$135,000. Combining the savings from CEFACEI and Mother-to-Mother&#13;
programs, the total savings for the component will be US$3.6 million. This is not only significant&#13;
savings on public expenditures, but also an efficient way of improving equity in preschool&#13;
education and alleviating poverty, especially in the rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
5.3   Another major savings would come from the lower secondary education scholarship&#13;
program. The rationale of the program is to provide financial support to students from the rural&#13;
low-income families, thus allowing them to attend lower secondary schools. The amount per&#13;
scholarship is US$315 per year. The total costs for secondary scholarship programn would be&#13;
about US$3 million over the life of the project. Comparing the costs of building more schools to&#13;
accommodate the same number of students, the total cost would be on the order of US$19.5&#13;
million. Obviously, the cost for building schools is much higher than the cost for scholarships.&#13;
Savings from the scholarship program compared to the option of building more schools would be&#13;
about US$16 million. (Annex 13).&#13;
B. Impact on Women&#13;
5.4   Approximately half of the children who would benefit from an improved quality of&#13;
educational services would be girls; their access to higher levels of education and better work&#13;
opportunities would thus improve. The selection criteria for scholarships will benefit girls over&#13;
boys (at least a 60% awarded to girls) to raise female enrollment. It is expected that the targeted&#13;
educational inputs will decrease the gap between girls and boys in termns of repetition, drop out,&#13;
failure rates and enrollment. Further benefits can also be expected, as research has shown that&#13;
increasing the education levels of women has a significant positive effect on the health status and&#13;
the educational attainment of children, and also contributes to lower fertility.&#13;
C. Environmental Impact&#13;
5.5   The project will have no direct environmental effects, and has been classified as C.&#13;
D. Participatory Approach&#13;
5.6   As the parental role is crucial in early childhood development, this project incorporates&#13;
parents in the delivery of the pre-primary curriculum. The project will support community-&#13;
administered CEFACEIs, and give parents and communities a prominent role in administering the&#13;
funds to pay the community educators.&#13;
E. Project Risks&#13;
5.7   The first risk is the limited managerial and administrative capacity of MOE. This risk will&#13;
be attenuated through: (a) the appointment of experienced managers to head the implementation&#13;
unit; (b) the training of staff involved with the project in administrative tasks; (c) the preparation&#13;
of a detailed manual of project operating procedures; (d) the establishment of clear and detailed&#13;
monitoring indicators for the project and explicit timetables for key actions; (e) the design of a&#13;
simple procurement and disbursement program for textbooks and infrastructure, the two largest&#13;
expenditures. The second risk is the limited capacity of the MOE for planning and implementing&#13;
projects on a large scale. This risk will be attenuated through the provision of technical assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
for each component and reliance on external experts (national and international) to implement&#13;
some of the components. The provision of technical assistance will strengthen MOE's capacity&#13;
for making policy decisions. The contracting of principal activities such as implementation of the&#13;
evaluation system or textbook production will ensure quality and free the MOE of direct&#13;
responsibility for implementation.&#13;
F. Program Objective Category&#13;
5.8   The project falls under the Program Objective Category of poverty reduction and would&#13;
support a program of targeted interventions as part of the Government's national policy of&#13;
equitable access to education opportunities, by channeling resources especially to poor and rural&#13;
areas, thus contributing to poverty reduction and the development of human resources.&#13;
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1   During negotiations the Government agreed to:&#13;
(a)   conduct Annual Project Reviews with an annual project implementation review&#13;
report and prepare an annual implementation plan for the following year, starting&#13;
in July 1997 (para. 4.3);&#13;
(b)   furnish to the Bank, during the month of August 1996, a budget and an investment&#13;
plan for, and the targets to be achieved in, the implementation of the project in&#13;
1997 and exchange views with the Bank on said budget, plan and targets, by no&#13;
later than September 30, 1996 (para. 4.3);&#13;
(c)   conduct a mid-term review in 1999 (para. 4.4);&#13;
(d)   follow the Bank Procurement Guidelines for all procurement of goods and services&#13;

32&#13;
maintenance costs of the schools included under the project; and (ii) in IFARHU's&#13;
budget a separate line covering the scholarships for Primary and Lower Secondary&#13;
students (para.3.8)&#13;
6.2   As conditions for effectiveness the borrower will:&#13;
(a)   submit a detailed project implementation plan for 1996 for all components (para.&#13;
4.3);&#13;
(b)   agree to provide evidence that a budget line has been included in the 1996&#13;
Government's budget for promotoras, scholarships, and operating and&#13;
maintenance costs (para. 3.8);&#13;
(c)   provide evidence that the revolving fund has been established and that the deposit&#13;
of counterpart funds in the amount of $250,000 has been made (para. 3.5);&#13;
(d)   put into effect the Operational Manual (para. 3.10); and&#13;
(e)   ensure that the implementation agreements between MOE and FES and MOE and&#13;
IFARHU have been signed (para. 2.20).&#13;
6.3   Recommendation. Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project&#13;
would constitute a suitable basis for a loan of US$ 35.0 million to the Republic of Panama.&#13;

SECTOR FINANCING&#13;
A. Public Expenditure in Education&#13;
I.     The Government has given a high priority to education sector funding.  As a result,&#13;
Panama ranks high, compared to other developing and Latin American countries, in terms of&#13;
percentage of GDP and total public sector resources allocated to education. However, higher&#13;
education receives about one third of these resources, while pre-primary education is given a&#13;
disproportionately low share. The high share given to university education and the minuscule fee&#13;
(approximately US$ 50) charged to university students result in an across-the-board subsidy to&#13;
many students whose families could afford to contribute to the cost of their studies. The structure&#13;
of subsector resource allocation favors higher income groups at the expense of lower income&#13;
groups, who would benefit from additional expenditures for pre-primary and primary education.&#13;
At the same time, pre-primary and primary education, which serve 54 percent of this population&#13;
and include a large percentage of poor students, receive only 40.9 percent of total resources.&#13;
Only 1.7 percent of total public expenditure for education is allocated to pre-primary education, a&#13;
figure far below international levels.&#13;

Levels of expenditure&#13;
2.     Public expenditure in education, as measured by several indicators, is high in comparison&#13;
to other Latin American and developing countries, and even comparable to developed countries&#13;
by some indicators. It is 5.1 percent of GNP, the highest percentage in Latin America, and almost&#13;
as high as the 5.3 percent average for such expenditures in developed countries.&#13;
Trends in expenditures&#13;
3.     The level of public expenditure in education remained relatively constant in the period&#13;
between 1983 and 1991; expenditures as a percentage of GDP and total public sector expenditure&#13;
remained virtually unchanged. However, there was an abrupt change in public expenditure in&#13;
education in 1992-1993, when the aggregate level of expenditure increased 28.4 percent and&#13;
expenditure per capita increased 23.7 percent over the 1990-1991 levels (Table 2). Although&#13;
there were increases in public expenditure in education as percentages of GDP and total public&#13;
sector expenditure in the same period, these increases were a more modest 8 percent and 11&#13;

Government strategy to continue to give a high priority to the education sector.&#13;

4.    The Government's general revenues financed 93.3 percent of recurrent public education&#13;
expenditures during 1991-94. The remaining 6.7 percent was financed from an earmarked tax of&#13;
2.75 percent on salaries and the income of self-employed persons. General Government revenues&#13;
financed 62.6 percent of investment expenditures, while external sources financed 37.4 percent.&#13;
External financing is derived principally from IDB and some small grants from the United States&#13;
Agency for International Development (USAID). IDB has assisted secondary schools in several&#13;
operations over the past twenty-five years that have financed technical assistance, scholarships,&#13;
and the construction, rehabilitation, expansion, and equipment of secondary schools. It has also&#13;
financed the Social Emergency Fund (Fondo de Emergencia Social, FES) which is used to&#13;
rehabilitate and renovate primary school buildings.&#13;
5.    Parental fees and employer contributions are additional sources of funds for pre-primary&#13;
school programs and higher education, but there are no fees for primary and secondary students.&#13;
Parents of students attending the.public Jardines de Infancia may be required to pay a fee of up&#13;
to US$ 10 per month. There are neither guidelines on the fees parents are required to pay nor&#13;
record-keeping requirements for collections. The principal has authority over the use of funds.&#13;
The level of fee collection and the importance of fees in the operation of schools are both difficult&#13;
to evaluate, due to the dearth of records. The Jardines de Infancia have also benefited from&#13;
materials provided by the provinces and families. The informal Family and Community Center for&#13;
Initial Education (Centro Familiar y Comunitario de Educacion Inicial, CEFACEI) program is&#13;
financed by a monthly parental fee of US$ 2-10 and a small annual grant from the Organization of&#13;
American States (OAS). The fees paid by parents cover about 75 percent of the cost of salaries&#13;
required to operate the centers. As in the case of the Jardines de Infancia, there are insufficient&#13;
guidelines, records, and information about the relative importance of fee payments as a source of&#13;
financing for the CEFACEI.  The Centers of Infant and Family Orientation (Centros de&#13;
Orientaci6n Infantil y Familiar, COIF) are located in workplaces and largely supported by&#13;
employers.&#13;

6.    Students enrolled in Panama's two public universities are charged an annual fee of about&#13;
US$ 50, which is unnecessarily low. Fee revenues total US$ 2.8 million and cover approximately&#13;
4.1 percent of total university expenditures.&#13;
Allocation&#13;
7.    The relative shares of public expenditure allocated for the three principal levels of&#13;
education -- basic (including pre-primary and primary), secondary, and higher education --&#13;
remained almost constant between 1983 and 1991. However, in 1991-92 there was a significant&#13;
4.9 percent decline from the preceding two years in the allocation to basic education, and a 6.1&#13;
percent increase in the allocation to higher education. Although the percentage decline in the&#13;
allocation of public resources to basic education and the increase in the allocation of such&#13;
resources to higher education are not great, they are significant in that they exacerbate an already&#13;
inequitable distribution of resources.   Higher education receives almost one third of public&#13;
education resources, to serve the 10 percent of students attending publicly-financed schools at&#13;
that level.&#13;

8.    Students at the University of Panama and the Technological University pay an annual fee&#13;
of about US$ 50. Although there is no family income data for students at the University of&#13;
Panama, such data for the 11,000 students at the Technological University, show that about one&#13;
third of students come from families with annual incomes over US$ 7,032, the top quintile of&#13;
family income in Panama.  A similar family income profile could be assumed for students&#13;
attending the University of Panama. It is clear that a major state subsidy is going to students from&#13;
middle- and upper-income families who could afford to pay for all or a substantial part of the cost&#13;
of a university education. In contrast, the fees at private sector universities for upper-income&#13;
students are about US$ 2,000, for middle-income students, about US$ 800, and for lower-income&#13;
students, about US$ 500.&#13;
Private Education Financing&#13;
9.    Private school expenditures were estimated to be US$ 77.4 million for 1992, equivalent to&#13;
about 24.4 percent of total sector expenditures. Private school expenditures were particularly&#13;
important at the secondary level, where they accounted for 37.9 percent of total expenditures, and&#13;
least important at the higher level, where they accounted for only 8.7 percent of total&#13;
expenditures.  Private school expenditure on a per capita basis far exceeded per capita&#13;
expenditure by the public sector on all levels, except in higher education, where public sector&#13;
expenditure exceeded that of the private sector by about 20 percent.&#13;

10.   The combined education expenditure of the private and public sector was about 7.4&#13;
percent of GDP in 1993. This calculation was based on direct costs and did not include the&#13;
indirect costs incurred by families for school supplies, textbooks, uniforms, and transportation.&#13;
The calculation also excludes the cost of studying abroad, which is fairly common at the higher&#13;
education level.&#13;

D. Teacher Salaries and Working Conditions&#13;
11.   There are two main components of the educational system in Panama for school teachers&#13;
(initial, primary and secondary levels): salaries and work place.  The salary structure is&#13;
predetermined by the kind of formation the teacher has and by years of work experience, while&#13;
work location is determined by a competence system based on improvement, experience and&#13;
professional formation.&#13;
12.   The salary structure in July 1994 consists of an initial salary, which depends on the&#13;
professional formation of the teacher. This salary is in place for an initial two- year trial period.&#13;
Once this stage is completed, the salary is readjusted 0-10%, depending on professional&#13;
formation. Thereafter, the salary is subject to bi-annual readjustments, which add a constant&#13;
amount to the base salary after every two years on the job. In the case of primary teachers (51%&#13;
of the total in 1992), their salaries were incremented by US$ 13 every two years, while the&#13;
salaries of secondary teachers with a specialization were increased by US$ 18 every two years.&#13;

13.    Based on an international comparison, teacher salaries in Panama are high. If we consider&#13;
that in 1992, GDP per capita in Panama increased to US$ 2,367, then a primary school teacher&#13;
salary fluctuated--according to years of work experience-- between 1.85 and 2.91 times GDP per&#13;
capita. This number is relatively high when compared with other countries in the region (see Table&#13;
6), where the average teaching salary is 2.5 times GDP per capita. Only three countries are above&#13;
Panama among the 12 cases considered.&#13;

14.   Teacher salaries are high within Panama as well. According to a PRELAC report, the&#13;
average income of the eighth percentile of households was US$ 379 in 1989. Incorporating the&#13;
14% increase in per capita income between 1989 and 1992, a projection of US$ 432 is obtained&#13;
for 1992, when the average liquid salary of teachers was US$ 420. Teachers are clearly among&#13;
the higher wage earners in Panamanian society.&#13;
15.   Public school teachers in Panama are fortunate not only in salaries but also in working&#13;
hours (5 and 1/2 hours 5 days a week for a period of 36 weeks in a school year), social security&#13;
(complete package), retirement age (approximately 50), and job security and stability. But these&#13;
benefits are not linked to performance criteria, except for a dubious system of points for location&#13;
transfers (traslados). In other words, teachers receive the benefits mentioned independent of the&#13;
level of dedication and effort they put into their work. This shows that the education incentive&#13;
system rewards teachers regardless of their productivity. One anticipated result of this incentive&#13;
scheme is high fiscal funding, and a glut of teachers with low educational achievement.&#13;
16.   The policy implications point towards a reform in the incentive system, in order to link the&#13;
benefits of teaching to educational achievement. Teachers in Panama should also be subject to the&#13;
new norms directed towards decreasing the deficit of the social security system and increasing the&#13;
retirement age.&#13;
Salary System: Incentive for Teacher Union Pressure and Explosion of Costs&#13;
17.   The basic change in the salary system  agreed to in 1993 refers to the concept of&#13;
"oversalary" (sobresueldo) or salary increase for teachers, based on years of work experience.&#13;
With the change, the readjustment is made through a higher initial salary level and incremental&#13;
increases over time (see Table 7).&#13;
18.   There are two main fiscal implications of this new salary scheme. First is the impact of&#13;
paying each teacher according to years of work experience. An estimate shows a 5-10% increase&#13;
in additional resources needed by the Government for the first year. Second, a skewed effect&#13;
because as teachers get older the salaries paid will increase in relation to the present. In addition,&#13;
the new salary system creates a heavy fiscal burden for the social security system, because it is&#13;
based on the amount of the last salary received, which will be increased from 25% to 37%&#13;
(provisional).&#13;

19.    The 1993 teacher strike and the conditions for its termination illustrate a perverse&#13;
incentive for the teacher salary and benefit system in Panama. Teachers now have an incentive to&#13;
exert pressure on the Government as a group, since their negotiating power depends on the&#13;
number of teachers participating in the strike. In addition, the fact that the benefits obtained favor&#13;
all of them, ensures a massive, synergistic movement. The overall results for Panamanian society&#13;
are negative. Fiscal concessions have a high cost, because they favor the teaching profession&#13;
without guaranteeing an improvement in education. Again this is due to the lack of connection&#13;
between benefits and achievements in the system.&#13;
20.    As mentioned above, the policy implication is to link benefits to productivity and&#13;
educational achievement. Salary adjustments should be made selectively, rewarding teacher merit&#13;
and experience.&#13;

Inefficiency of the Teacher Promotion/Transfer System&#13;
21.   An important component in the working conditions of teachers is location: rural or urban;&#13;
small or large city; etc. Different from other conditions, location is determined by competition,&#13;
theoretically based on the achievement and quality of the teacher. Vacancies are publicized by the&#13;
Ministry of Education for two reasons: (i) new position due to increase in enrollment; (ii)&#13;
replacement due to retirement, firing or death. The creation of new openings, though, is really due&#13;
to pressure from new entrants and incentives given to principals and supervisors.&#13;
22.   The transfer system is complex and competition-based.  It requires each candidate to&#13;
choose a maximum of five possible destinations, and to present various elements that contribute&#13;
to the score.  There are three elements: professional formation, experience, perfection and&#13;
contributions made to education.  These variables in turn make up a complex system  of&#13;
approximately 60 items for the score.&#13;
23.   The process of relocation and transfer is massive. It is estimated that each year around&#13;
9,000 teachers compete to be transferred and about 12,000 new candidates try to enter the&#13;
system. This implies that during each year, one third of all teachers take part in this competition&#13;
and an equivalent of 43% of teachers, already hired, try to enter the system.&#13;
24.   There are at least three sources of inefficiency in the transfer and appointment system.&#13;
First, the quality of education inevitably suffers if more than one third of teachers spend a lot of&#13;
time and energy each year competing to be transferred to another location. This process forces&#13;
teachers to attend workshops (to increase their scores), to travel and visit different locations, to&#13;
spend time and other resources trying to influence the Ministry to select them and to find out&#13;
about applications, etc.&#13;
25.   A second source of inefficiency derives from the significant administrative cost of the&#13;
transfer/appointment system  for the Ministry.  Each year it must process around 21,000&#13;
applications, select the candidates and make sure that the vacancies are filled. Workshops and&#13;
courses which increase the scores for transfers and appointments represent a third source of&#13;
inefficiency. Moreover, the institutions which offer this training are not subject to quality control.&#13;
26.   The policy implications are two; first, appointments must confront a structural problem of&#13;
oversupply of candidates in the system. This in turn is related to the benefits and privileges&#13;
teachers receive vis-a-vis the lack of responsibility in their work. Second, the transfer system&#13;
generates inefficiencies and some inequity, both of which need to be addressed.&#13;

Targeting&#13;
TARGETING&#13;
Basic Criteria&#13;
1.  The main objectives of the Basic Education Project are to improve the quality, efficiency and equity of&#13;
Panama's basic education system. There is a strong relationship between access to educational materials and&#13;
the socio-economic conditions of schoolchildren's famiLies. Children of poorer farnilies cannot buy the&#13;
books, notebooks and other learning materials not provided by schools and therefore they learn less, repeat&#13;
grades and eventually drop out.&#13;
2.  In order to compensate for poorer children's disadvantages in terms of access to better quality&#13;
education, the project will focus on townships with the highest levels of poverty according to representative&#13;
indicators: poor housing conditions, less access to educational benefits, and nutritional deficiencies. The&#13;
percentage of indigenous population, as well as the prevalence of poverty in overcrowded urban areas, has&#13;
been taken into consideration for targeting.&#13;
Methodology for Project Targeting&#13;
3.  Townships were chosen as targeting units so that project interventions can have the maximum effect in&#13;
poor areas. The country's 510 townships (corregimientos) are distributed among 67 districts, which in tum&#13;
correspond to 9 provinces. Township populations vary from 88 inhabitants in Playa Chiquita (Santa Isabel&#13;
District) to a maximum of 199,400 in Belisario Porras (San Miguelito District). 69% of townships (353)&#13;
have less than 2,500 inhabitants, while the 34 townships with over 15,000 inhabitants (7%) contain 51% of&#13;
the country's total population (1.2 million out of 2.3 million total inhabitants).&#13;
Selection of Indicators&#13;
4.  Three types of variables per township were used as poverty indicators: (a) housing quality, according to&#13;
the 1990 Population and Housing Census; (b) access to education, according to 1993 statistics by the&#13;
Ministry of Education; and (c) nutritional status, according to the 1994 Census of Students' Height by the&#13;
Ministries of Education and Health.&#13;
5.  Housing quality is reflected by the percentage of homes without drinking water and sanitation services&#13;
and with dirt floors. Access to education is gauged by the percentage of children between the ages of 6 and&#13;
15 who do not attend school and the percentage of students who repeat grades or drop out of school.&#13;
Nutritional status is indicated by the percentage of the population between the ages of 6 and 15 whose height&#13;
is shorter than normal for their age.&#13;
6.  The total population of school-age children (between the ages of 6. and 15) is used as an additional&#13;
variable to allow the inclusion of townships with high concentrations of disadvantaged urban inhabitants who&#13;
would not be detected only by qualitative variables. The percentage of the indigenous population is also used&#13;
as a compensating variable to ensure that priority is assigned to small townships with a predominantly&#13;
indigenous population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Targeting&#13;
Consistency of Variables&#13;
7.  Because the variables selected as being representative of poverty conditions are so diverse, they cannot&#13;
be directly combined in a composite index. Some represent percentages of the number of homes, others are&#13;
percentages of the school-age population, of school enrollment of total population, and yet another represents&#13;
absolute population numbers. In order to compute the composite index of poverty, the values of all variables&#13;
have been converted to a uniform value scale of 0 to 100. The numbers used in the targeting table are the&#13;
converted values, not the original percentages or numbers, which are found in separate tables.&#13;
8.  The highest original value of each variable (which indicates more unfavorable conditions) is represented&#13;
by 0 on the converted scale, and the lowest original value of the same variable is represented by 100,&#13;
regardless of the variable's original value range. For example, for the school-age population variable, the&#13;
highest value of 28,889 becomes 0, and the lowest value (16) becomes 100. For the variable of school-age&#13;
children not attending school, the highest value of 86.42% becomes an index of 0, and the lowest value of&#13;
2.3 5% becomes an index of 100. Intermediate values are calculated using the following formula:&#13;
VN = (VMAX - VA)/(VMAX - VMN) x 100&#13;
in which:&#13;
VA        is the original value, to be converted to the new scale;&#13;
VN        is the new value resulting in a scale of 0 to 100;&#13;
VMAX    is the highest original value of the variable;&#13;
V\MIN    is the lowest original value of the variable.&#13;
9.  The formula inverts the order of the values to try to arrange the resulting index in ascending order, from&#13;
lowest to highest. This is an arbitrary decision since the same result would be obtained by converting the&#13;
values in the same original order and arranging the values of the resulting index from highest to lowest.1 The&#13;
resulting values, converted to a scale of 0 to 100, represent indicators of the relative position of each&#13;
variable's original values within their respective range, and may be combined as such in a composite index&#13;
using arithmetical averages, which could not be done with the original values.&#13;
Computation of the Composite Index of Poverty&#13;
10. The poverty index is the weighted average of values converted to a scale of 0 to 100 of all variables&#13;
used. Equal weight has been assigned to the set of population variables (school-age and indigenous, which&#13;
are of a quantitative nature) and to the set of qualitative indicators of poverty conditions (housing, education&#13;
and nutrition) in order to ensure that the project's benefits reach the greatest possible number of persons in the&#13;
poorest townships in rural and disadvantaged urban areas.&#13;
11. The weights assigned to each variable appear in the upper part of each page of the table. The variable&#13;
for homes with dirt floors has a weight of 20 because it is considered the most characteristic of extreme rural&#13;
and urban poverty. The other housing and educational variables have a weight of 4 each, and the nutritional&#13;
variable has a weight of 10, to complete the combined weight of 50 for this set of variables. The school-age&#13;
The formula to convert the values of a variable in the same original order would be:&#13;
VN = (VA - VIN)/(VMAX - VMN) x 100.&#13;

Targeting&#13;
population variable has a weight of 40, and the indigenous population variable 10; these two variables add up&#13;
to 50 and have an essentially distributive function in calculating the index.&#13;
12. The result is shown in the attached table, with the 510 townships arranged according to the composite&#13;
index of poverty. The lowest index (45.95, top priority) corresponds to the Penia Blanca township with a&#13;
population of 1,986 in Chiriqui province, while the highest (98.90) corresponds to Otoque Occidente with a&#13;
population of 210 in Panama province.&#13;
13. The order of priority resulting from the poverty index allows us to target objectively and safely the&#13;
investments of a basic education project according to selected criteria in order to achieve the proposed&#13;
objectives of greater educational quality, efficiency and equity. Among the 32 poorest townships is the&#13;
country's most populous (Belisario Porras), a highly disadvantaged zone on the outsldrts of Panama City.&#13;
However, 50% of the school-aged basic education population lives in the first 238 townships on the list (47%&#13;
of the total number of townships), meaning that a large number of scarcely populated rural townships, as well&#13;
the most important disadvantaged urban population centers, hold top priority positions. These also include&#13;
all townships with a significant proportion of indigenous inhabitants.&#13;
14. The project will target 185 Corregimientos out of the 510, distributed over the 68 districts covering 41&#13;
percent of the school population from grades I to 9.&#13;

Multigrade Teacher Training&#13;
TEACHIER TRAIMNG IN MULTIGRADE METHODOLOGY&#13;
Background&#13;
1.  The first training seminar on Multigrade was planned and implemented in 1986 and was delivered&#13;
for technical staff of the Provincial Supervision Bureau. This Bureau was assigned, and still has,&#13;
responsibility for disseminating guidance to teachers on techniques and strategies for multi-class&#13;
teaching. The core document entitled Work techniques for multi-class teachers was presented and&#13;
discussed during this seminar and now serves as the methodological guideline for teachers.&#13;
2.  Based on this seminar, the Ministry of Education has continued to implement teacher seminars for&#13;
the purpose of increasing the number of trained teachers, although from 1987 to 1989 the country's&#13;
political and economic situation limited the planning of new training seminars. Seminars increased&#13;
from 1990 to 1995 and workshops were held to prepare activity and content charts for mathematics,&#13;
science, Spanish and social studies in compensation for the lack of free textbooks.&#13;
3.  To date, statistics show that, of the about 3,800 active teachers who teach various grades at the&#13;
same time, only 625 of them, along with 425 teacher interns, have been trained in the relevant work&#13;
techniques. Moreover, due to the lack of an ongoing system to assess and monitor trained staff, it has&#13;
not been possible to assess the actual impact of training, that is, its effectiveness in terms of the&#13;
application of techniques to improve educational achievement. Therefore, methodologies will be&#13;
offered through training to facilitate the development of teachers' creativity in organizing leaming&#13;
settings, make students participate in skills building, and ensure the essential elements of advancement&#13;
and competitiveness.&#13;
4.  In addition, the provision of classroom libraries and activity charts, and the use of innovative&#13;
methodologies, will require seminars and workshops to achieve effective, comprehensive improvement&#13;
of educational quality, in terns of the interests and needs of students and the community.&#13;
5.  Therefore, the MNNEDUC/World Bank Basic Education Project, through its efforts to support&#13;
education in Panama, proposes to handle the situation from the standpoint of teacher training and the&#13;
provision of educational materials to all schools with multi-class teachers throughout the country, by&#13;
means of a training and skills improvement plan and classroom libraries which are considered basic&#13;
resources to enhance the quality of education.&#13;
6.  It is essential to increase the number of multi-class teachers skilled in proper procedures in order&#13;
to ensure the best possible use of time and resources, so that the objectives and core subjects of the&#13;
elementary school curriculum are covered satisfactorily. In the future, this could also enable graduates&#13;
to continue their studies at the next educational level with the required entrance requirements,&#13;
contribute towards improving their environment and participate more efficiently in community life.&#13;
7. Training and other skills enhancement efforts will be guided by a model that encompasses the use&#13;
of participatory, dynamic teaching techniques leading to autonomous student achievement and that&#13;
includes parents and other community institutions in the learning process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65                                    ANNEX 5&#13;
Multigrade Teacher Training&#13;
8. Due to the teacher's importance as a basic means of raising the quality of education, skills&#13;
enhancement plays a leading role by helping to integrate efforts carried out in the classroom and make&#13;
them consistent.&#13;
Training of Teachers and Supervisors&#13;
General Objective&#13;
9.  To increase the number of students in multi-class schools who achieve passing grades and&#13;
remain in school, through the proper of use appropriate methodologies and learning materials.&#13;
Specific Objectives&#13;
10. To improve the training of teachers and supervisors who will act as facilitators of the&#13;
teaching-learning process, in the search for, and implementation of, altematives leading to the&#13;
achievement of more effective, efficient education in rural, indigenous and disadvantaged urban&#13;
areas.&#13;
11. To set up teams of facilitators who will disseminate the various phases of training,&#13;
monitoring and assessment of active teachers and student teachers by strengthening the existing&#13;
organization for this purpose.&#13;
Description&#13;
12. The training offered will include efforts to counteract the limitations or lack of training of persons&#13;
working in multi-class schools. It will also cover means to give special attention to children who are&#13;
behind in their studies and to the use of learning materials and school libraries. It is proposed that a set&#13;
of technical and teaching activities be prepared to contribute to the training of creative teachers with&#13;
knowledge and skills in handling several classes at the same time; in the optimum use of work charts&#13;
and classroom libraries; in effective distribution of available time; in better use of school and non-school&#13;
space; in the use of strategies that include community members in educational and curricular efforts;&#13;
and in the use of active techniques and the development of varied activities that help students to learn&#13;
independently.&#13;
13. It is also proposed that the teaching function of provincial and national supervisors be&#13;
consolidated to ensure training as well as guidance and monitoring of daily practices, in order to&#13;
institutionalize the proposed actions. A group of national supervisors and 148 provincial supervisors&#13;
will conform the technical group in charge of training and monitoring responsibilities.&#13;
14. In the qualitative improvement program for schools with teachers of multi-grade, various types of&#13;
efforts to enhance teachers' skills are proposed, including on-the-job training; the provision of books,&#13;
documents and guides; the publishing of monthly information bulletins; demonstrations of learning&#13;
materials prepared using simple resources, etc. A national congress is planned for year m and an&#13;
international one in year IV so that teachers and supervisors can present the results of the application of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Multigrade Teacher Training&#13;
their new skills and share their experiences. It is hoped that this will motivate research and the&#13;
application of techniques leading to qualitative improvement of education in rural areas.&#13;
15. Two courses will be given in two phases: an intensive course during the vacation period, with 30&#13;
classroom hours and 15 hours outside the classroom, plus a feedback session on the sixth day; and an&#13;
intensive course comprised of seven Saturday sessions during the school year, six classroom hours each&#13;
session, which will be supplemented by activities in daily practice. These courses will be mandatory for&#13;
supervisors and active teachers, that is, the total number of educators will be doubly covered. An&#13;
optional course will also be given to cover once again the total number of educators that constitute the&#13;
potential demand. The multi-class teaching course will also be given to future teachers before they&#13;
graduate from teacher training school. The mandatory courses will be :Multi-class, Specialized&#13;
teaching and a third course, optional, deterrmined according to specific needs. Efforts will also be&#13;
developed to strengthen group working techniques, specifically the preparation and implementation of&#13;
activity charts, resources and basic teaching materials (experience charts, felt boards, numbers box,&#13;
flash cards, pocket charts, logic blocks, etc.).&#13;
16. A specific workshop will be offered to 80 teachers on the preparation of activity charts to help&#13;
children construct their own individual and/or group learning process and to collect a set of charts that&#13;
can later be printed and distributed to all multi-class teachers. Participants will be selected by provinces&#13;
among multi-class teachers who have demonstrated relevant abilities and skills.&#13;
17. A library course will also be given to multi-class teachers and to junior high school teachers. To&#13;
supplement this training course, classroom research and reading encouragement will also be planned.&#13;
18. All courses will be graded.&#13;
19. In addition to the above-mentioned courses, the Multi-class Coturse will be added for future&#13;
teachers about to graduate from teacher training school who, despite student teaching in multi-class&#13;
schools, require specific methodological and theoretical elements which are not included in the teacher&#13;
training curriculum. This course will only be given on an intensive basis.&#13;
Training of provincial and national supervisors&#13;
20. Before taking all the courses for teachers, supervisory staff should participate in a mandatory five-&#13;
day course consisting of 30 classroom hours and 15 non-classroom hours, plus a feedback session, on&#13;
Teacher Counseling.&#13;
21. This course will allow future teacher facilitators and supervisors to be selected, in close&#13;
coordination with their respective functions.&#13;
Training of provincial facilitators&#13;
22. In order to offer workshop seminars for teachers, provincial supervisors and later the best&#13;
qualified school principals will be selected to act as facilitators, based on the teacher counseling course&#13;
and meeting specific requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

23. Subsequent training offered to them will cover the content of the syllabus prepared for each&#13;
course, and knowledge of the methodology to be used, as contained in the facilitator's manuals.&#13;
Moreover, for use after their training, they will receive a supplementary anthology and a glossary to&#13;
help them better understand the contents.&#13;
24. National supervisors will administer the courses for provincial supervisors. This training of&#13;
provincial facilitators, related to the courses, with an intensive stage of six sessions and a longer period&#13;
of seven Saturday sessions, will take place at provincial headquarters, covering the established number&#13;
of sessions plus seven planning and assessment sessions lasting four hours each, prior to each Saturday&#13;
session.&#13;
Training of the Central Technical Group [GTC] (National Supervisors)&#13;
25. For each of the courses provided to provincial supervisors, members of the GTC will receive&#13;
training by the persons who designed the respective course. This training will take place during&#13;
working hours at the central offices, and should be supplemented by conferences, workshops or other&#13;
events related to the contents and objectives of these courses.&#13;
Course Contents&#13;
26. The contents of each workshop seminar will be organized in two large blocks, according to the&#13;
type of teaching: theory and methodology, for the intensive phase; and teacher strategy in the&#13;
classroom setting, for the seven Saturday sessions. Those related to Teacher Counseling will be&#13;
organized in five chapters because they correspond to only one phase.&#13;
27. The contents will be consistent with a constructive teaching concept. They will cover techniques&#13;
and methodological procedures aimed at multi-class work, teaching groups directly and indirectly,&#13;
creativity, research strategies, use of the library as a basic supplement to the teaching-learning process&#13;
within the child's social environment, and mechanisms for process and product assessments. They will&#13;
also include guidelines for participating in the preparation of a monthly teachers' bulletin for multi-class&#13;
teachers.&#13;
28. During the Saturday sessions, spread out over the school year to monitor teachers in their daily&#13;
work, the formation of working groups will be strengthened, taking into account the appropriate&#13;
distribution of contents, suitability of curricula, and learning assessments. During this phase, note&#13;
should be taken of teachers' experience in implementing what they learn from these courses in the&#13;
classroom setting, and various new and highly practical contents should be included. Short-term&#13;
remedial courses for slower students will be stressed, based on the use made of the results of ongoing&#13;
assessments of learning and teacher performance.&#13;
29. The Saturday sessions, in which the planning, development and assessment of class work will be&#13;
monitored, will imply the cumulative acquisition and application of skills.&#13;

30. The provision of classroom libraries is a valuable support in supplementing learning activities, and&#13;
therefore proper training will include the administration and management of such assets, so that the&#13;
bibliographic materials supplied can be put to optimum use.&#13;
Course Assessment and Accreditation&#13;
31. During each training stage, strict assessment criteria must be met which will affect course&#13;
accreditation.  Product and process assessments will be included, along with assessments of the&#13;
learning of both contents and methodology, and of attitudes. For course accreditation, together with&#13;
the results of the assessment, attendance will be considered (100% for the intensive course, and six of&#13;
the seven Saturday sessions, provided that the absence does not occur during the first or last work&#13;
session). Course accreditation will be essential requirement for members of the technical group and for&#13;
provincial facilitators, so that they in tum can provide training.&#13;
Printed Support Materials&#13;
32. Each course will have printed matter prepared ex profeso: documents for teachers (anthologies,&#13;
Vwth guidelines for their use), manuals for facilitators (course description, methodologies for&#13;
conducting each session and guidelines for their development), and assessment tools (both for courses&#13;
and participants' learning).&#13;
33. There will also be similar documents for the intensive phase and tools for the development and&#13;
monitoring of Saturday sessions during the longer phase. Besides the documents prepared ex profeso,&#13;
other texts that are considered pertinent for the GTC may also be included.&#13;
34. The training programs and materials that are prepared will be submitted for consideration by the&#13;
relevant sector and by an expert in the subject who may be a local or international consultant, and who&#13;
will issue an opinion on the matter.&#13;
35. Courses that receive favorable opinions will be validated with teachers working in multi-class&#13;
groups. Based on the results of opinions and validations, relevant changes or adjustments will be made&#13;
before they are designed and published.&#13;
36. Moreover, based on the products obtained from the workshop offered to 80 teachers, 120 activity&#13;
charts will be included for grades m1 to VI, dealing with the four core subjects, i.e., Spanish,&#13;
mathematics, science and social studies. This package will be distributed during the Project's second&#13;
year of operation.&#13;
37. During the third year, a second set of activity charts, similar to the previous ones, will be provided&#13;
to students; these will be the result of multi-class teachers' efforts and creativity.&#13;
38. After the start-up of the Saturday sessions during the longer phase, an informative bulletin will&#13;
also be issued. It will serve as a forum for teachers' opinions and to disseminate activities prepared by&#13;
them. The best of these will be selected and published monthly in the bulletin.&#13;
&#13;

Operating Model&#13;
Technical Group&#13;
39. A central technical group, consisting of four full-time members, will be formed, preferably with&#13;
staff from the elementary school and teacher skills enhancement fields. This group will be responsible&#13;
for planning training activities, guidance and monitoring; for designing courses and preparing required&#13;
support material; for training provincial technical groups; and for monitoring and assessing activities&#13;
carried out by provinces. National supervisors, who will be responsible for providing training to&#13;
provincial facilitators, will join this group.&#13;
40 A Provincial Technical Coordinator will be designated for each province. This Coordinator will&#13;
be responsible for organizing courses for provincial facilitators and multi-class teachers, for overseeing&#13;
courses for teachers and supervisors, and for assessing the performance of provincial facilitators and&#13;
the development of courses.&#13;
41. There will be a ratio one provincial facilitator for each 30 teachers.&#13;
Teachers' Network&#13;
42. In order to consolidate a true training system in which actions can be institutionalized, teachers&#13;
will receive counseling in their groups or in larger group meetings, and the effects of training will be&#13;
monitored in the classroom. These actions will be compatible with the technical and teaching functions&#13;
assigned to provincial and national supervisors under current regulations.&#13;
Headquarters&#13;
43. The training of provincial facilitators, teachers and supervisors will take place at headquarters&#13;
located in places that are accessible to registrants, in order to facilitate the participation of persons&#13;
working in remote places with little communication.  Provincial technical coordinators at their&#13;
respective headquarters will be responsible for coordinating training dates. This implies dealing with&#13;
logistics, checking on schools and counseling provincial facilitators when they need guidance.&#13;
Institutional Self-Assessment&#13;
44. In order to verify compliance and quality of scheduled actions, as well as to support decision-&#13;
making on strengthening or correcting the processes, members of the central technical group and&#13;
national supervisors will make counseling and monitoring visits during the development of activities.&#13;
45. Each supervisor will make an annual visit during teacher training. He will also make four more&#13;
visits to observe the work of the teachers' network and consider the work of four of the Saturday&#13;
sessions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

70                                   ANNEX 5&#13;
Multigrade Teacher Training&#13;
46. In turn, the Provincial Technical Coordinator will monitor the intensive course, the operation of&#13;
the teachers' network and the Saturday sessions.&#13;
47. Annual planning meetings are held with provincial technical coordinators, as well as assessment&#13;
meetings with provincial technical coordinators and supervisors, lasting at least three days.&#13;
48. The monitoring carried out by national supervisors and provincial technical coordinators as well&#13;
as the teachers' network will follow a general design and employ specific tools to obtain systematic and&#13;
systematized data for use in institutional self-assessment.&#13;
49. With the proposed assessment model, it will be possible to detect whether training objectives have&#13;
been satisfactorily met. Teachers, students and members of the community will be consulted for this&#13;
purpose.&#13;
Equipment for Provincial Technical Coordination Units&#13;
50. Each provincial technical coordination unit will be supplied with equipment consisting of a&#13;
monitor, video cassette player, microcomputer, printer, modem, scanner, overhead projector, and&#13;
mimeograph machine. It should also be provided with a school library, sets of charts and any other&#13;
resource distributed to schools whose teachers participate in the workshop seminars, in order to make&#13;
the unit more familiar with how to use and maintain them.&#13;
Actions&#13;
To form and train a team of four technicians at headquarters plus the national&#13;
supervisors of the Ministry of Education, in charge of coordinating, counseling,&#13;
assessing and monitoring training.&#13;

Textbooks&#13;
TEXTBOOKS AND EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS SUBCOMIPONENT&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Several important developments have taken place recently in Panama with respect to the&#13;
evaluation and provision of textbooks. In 1958, 431,943 textbooks were distributed which, although&#13;
not enough for each child, supported teaching through group work. In 1970, under the ODECA-&#13;
ROCAP agreement, a half million mathematics, reading, science and social studies textbooks were&#13;
distributed, as well as 20,000 teachers' manuals. In 1972, the total reached 1,813,500 books. Between&#13;
1976 and 1979, printed materials prepared by the Ministry of Education were distributed to support&#13;
Educational Reform programs. Since then there have been no further projects to supply textbooks to&#13;
schools.&#13;
2.    With the support of the UNESCO-Germany 507 RLA Project, since 1992 the Ministry of&#13;
Education has promoted a program aimed at strengthening the process of preparing, producing and&#13;
using textbooks and reading materials.&#13;
3.    For the purpose of carrying out a study on policies and strategies in the field of textbooks and&#13;
reading materials, the Expanded Commission on Textbooks and Reading Materials was established,&#13;
consisting of Ministry of Education staff and representatives of national associations dealing with&#13;
textbooks and reading materials. Two important conclusions were reached from the study: the lack of&#13;
a coherent policy on this matter, and the insufficient provision of textbooks to schools, despite efforts&#13;
made in recent decades.&#13;
4.    Despite a good supply of textbooks and reading materials on the market, according to a study&#13;
carried out by the Ministry most of the textbooks offered by publishers follow a traditional educational&#13;
model based on the transmission of contents.&#13;
5.    The textbooks used by Panamanian students are selected by educators, based upon a list of&#13;
titles recommended by the Ministry following the initial procedure of evaluation and approval (Decree&#13;
N° 85 dated April 3, 1985, regulated by Resolution N° 663 dated April 30, 1985). The Ministry's&#13;
Bureau of Curriculum and Educational Technology has gained valuable experience in the design of&#13;
technical instruments and the procedures needed to carry out the evaluation process.&#13;
6.    In recent years, several of the Ministry's staff have received training in textbook design,&#13;
production and evaluation. Ministry representatives attended courses on this subject organized by the&#13;
Executive Secretariat of the Andres Bello Agreement (SECAB) in Santafe de Bogota and Quito, under&#13;
the framework of the Educational Materials Program promoted by said institution. Several staff have&#13;
written, or are presently writing, textbooks.&#13;
Justification&#13;
7.    Studies carried out in various countries show important gains in the academic performance of&#13;
students who use textbooks, in relation to those who lack them. These studies have demonstrated that&#13;
the availability of textbooks has significant effects on students' motivation and on the efficiency and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
73                                  ANNEX 6&#13;
Textbooks&#13;
organization of classwork; the textbook allows one teacher to work with several children at the same&#13;
time, favors independent study, helps make curriculum objectives explicit and tums them into learning&#13;
activities.&#13;
8.    Recent research by the Ministry of Education reveals that in Panama 67.90/o of textbooks are&#13;
purchased, meaning that only those families with a better economic status can buy them. In areas of&#13;
extreme poverty, where both children and teachers require greater assistance (most schools have multi-&#13;
grade classrooms in which a single teacher must teach various grades at the same time), schools lack&#13;
the libraries, textbooks, reading materials, and proper educational materials that parents are unable to&#13;
provide.&#13;
9.    The textbook provision plan, which will be aimed at the country's poorest schools, stems from&#13;
the theory that the availability of textbooks and other educational materials, together with other&#13;
educational efforts such as curriculum review, teacher training, improvement of schools and libraries,&#13;
and the establishment of a system to evaluate academic performance, may contribute towards&#13;
improving the quality of education.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
a)  To devise and implement a plan to supply textbooks, supplementary books and educational&#13;
materials aimed at the country's poorest schools, structured in such a way as to become self-&#13;
sustainable.&#13;
b)  To contribute towards improving the quality of general, basic education in the country's poorest&#13;
areas by supplying appropriate textbooks and educational materials that make the work of&#13;
teachers and students more efficient.&#13;
c)  To contribute towards encouraging students to read through the creation of school libraries that&#13;
serve both the school and the comrnunity.&#13;
d)  To strengthen the Ministry of Education's institutional and technical capacity with respect to&#13;
textbook evaluation, selection, distribution and use.&#13;
Products&#13;
Under this Project subcomponent, the following results will be obtained:&#13;
a)  Creation and training of a working team: in order to develop the textbook component, a&#13;
group will be formed in the Ministry of Education, comprised of specialists in each of the basic&#13;
disciplines; in reading and writing, children's and juvenile books, and textbooks.&#13;
b)  Evaluation instruments: under the framework of the Project, the Technical guide for&#13;
evaluating teaching materials, currently used to approve textbooks circulated on the domestic&#13;
market, will be restructured so that it may also be used in the process of evaluating and selecting&#13;
textbooks for the Project.&#13;
&#13;

Textbooks&#13;
c)  Procedures: the necessary procedures will be designed to organize the tasks of bidding,&#13;
evaluating, selecting and supplying textbooks.&#13;
d)  Provision of textbooks: purchase and distribution of textbooks, recreational and reference&#13;
books, and a basic set of educational materials to _schools located in areas of extreme poverty.&#13;
e)  Production and distribution of activity charts to motivate teachers to use more dynamic,&#13;
participatory methodologies.&#13;
f)   Training of teachers in schools covered by the Project to make optimal use of the books&#13;
distributed by the textbook provision plan.&#13;
g)  Monitoring: development of a monitoring and evaluation system to provide ongoing information&#13;
on the circulation and use of the textbooks supplied to the educational centers covered by the&#13;
Project.&#13;
Monitoring&#13;
10.   The Project offers a substantial contribution towards improving the quality of education by&#13;
implementing an action plan aimed at supplying textbooks and educational materials through classroom&#13;
and school libraries; promoting and implementing innovative methodologies leading to optimal use of&#13;
materials; improving the skills of teachers, especially those who work with various grades&#13;
simultaneously; supplying activity charts created through the use of dynamic methodologies for&#13;
independent learning; and including parents and the community in the search for solutions to&#13;
educational problems.&#13;
11.   A plan to supply textbooks, recreational and reference books, and educational materials will be&#13;
implemented, aimed at all multigrade-class in the country and the unigrade primary schools and the&#13;
lower secondary schools located in classified as poor and extremely poor according to the poverty&#13;
index. Mathematics and reading-writing textbooks will be supplied to the first two grades, After third&#13;
grade, science and social studies texts will be included. Ratio will be one textbook for every student.&#13;
12.   The textbook provision plan will be based on the textbooks, books and educational materials&#13;
available on the market, following a strict evaluation process. Publishers should make changes to&#13;
textbooks as suggested by the evaluation committees, in order to better adjust the books to school&#13;
needs. Textbooks will be printed in four ink colors, may not be expendable, and must be accompanied&#13;
by teachers' manuals.&#13;
13.   The textbooks will become school property and form part of school libraries that will contain,&#13;
besides these textbooks, a selection of about 30 recreational and reference books. Twelve books by&#13;
Panamanian authors of children's and juvenile literature will be selected, and participating firms will be&#13;
invited to submit bids for the graphic design and printing of these books. These books, as well as&#13;
textbooks, will form part of the books supplied to school and classroom libraries.&#13;
&#13;

Textbooks&#13;
14.   Children may borrow texts and books from the libraiy to take home. Both teachers and&#13;
parents will receive training to ensure the sustainability and best use of libraries.&#13;
15.   Along with the provision of texts, books and materials, teachers, supported by technical staff&#13;
from the Ministry of Education, will prepare "activity charts" under the framework of the Project,&#13;
aimed at enriching the overall teaching-learning process; the most original charts designed by teachers&#13;
will be published and circulated.&#13;
Implementation&#13;
16.   Books and educational materials to be supplied to schools, and purchased on the domestic and&#13;
international markets, will be evaluated to select those that best meet selection criteria and to determine&#13;
the changes that winning publishers should introduce in the special versions to be distributed under the&#13;
plan.&#13;
17.   Publishers of textbooks and educational matters will be invited to submit bids. With the advice&#13;
of an international consultant, the Ministry's textbook working group will design special tools to&#13;
evaluate books and will organize and train the committees responsible for evaluating bids from a&#13;
technical and instructional standpoint, under the direction of the Ministry's team of specialists. The&#13;
Ministry will strengthen its technical capacity to respond efficiently to the new needs of evaluating and&#13;
selecting books and materials.&#13;
18.   The development of activities related to this component will be the responsibility of the&#13;
coordinating team set up by the Ministry for this Project (numeral 4). This team will be comprised of&#13;
staff currently working in the Ministry who have had some experience in designing and evaluating&#13;
textbooks. It is also expected that local and international advisers will be hired to support the&#13;
Ministry's staff in those areas in which the Ministry either has no experience or requires specialized&#13;
assistance.&#13;
19.   Ad hoc committees will also be formed to evaluate, from  a technical and instructional&#13;
standpoint, the textbooks submitted by publishers during the bidding process; relevant procedures will&#13;
be designed for this purpose. Under the framework of the Project, both the permanent and committee&#13;
staffs will receive training in textbook evaluation.&#13;
20.    The Ministry's staff for this component will design a distribution system  to ensure that&#13;
textbooks and materials reach their final destination. Textbooks and educational materials will be sent&#13;
by winning publishers to the Provincial Offices of Education, boxed for subsequent distribution to the&#13;
schools. Publishers should include distribution costs in their bids. At each Provincial Office, a&#13;
coordinator will receive and supervise the quality and quantity of materials received and send them to&#13;
schools through the zone supervisor who in turn will deliver them to parents' associations in each&#13;
beneficiary township; these associations will be responsible for overseeing the delivery, proper use and&#13;
return of textbooks at the end of the school year. Parents are also expected to participate in caring for&#13;
classroom and school libraries, for which they will receive special training.&#13;
&#13;

76                                  ANNEX 6&#13;
Textbooks&#13;
21.   Along with the distribution, the Ministry will publish and widely disseminate the list of materials&#13;
delivered to each school in order to keep communities duly informed.&#13;
22.   School teachers and principals will receive training in the use of textbooks, in encouraging&#13;
students to read, and in handling the school library. Two educators will be selected per school to&#13;
disseminate information, acting as technical and administrative coordinators, respectively.&#13;
23.   After the second year, it is expected that a percentage of the textbooks delivered to schools will&#13;
be lost or damaged. The community, teachers and the students themselves will be encouraged to take&#13;
care of the textbooks and students and parents will be invited to end school periods repairing the&#13;
damaged books.&#13;
24.   There will be an ongoing follow-up on all these actions through supervision visits, meetings&#13;
with participating teachers, and surveys of teachers, students and the community.&#13;

Student Assessment&#13;
STUDENT ASSESSMENT SYSTEM&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Partial, limited efforts have been made in Panama to measure students' academic&#13;
performance. Between 1981 and 1985, as part of the Research Program to Evaluate Educational&#13;
System Achievements (an OAS Regional Program), third and sixth grade students in sample&#13;
schools in the provinces of Cocle and Panama were tested on their basic knowledge and on the&#13;
four basic subjects. The results were used to prepare teacher training programs and curriculum&#13;
adjustments in the province of Cocle.&#13;
2.    A Diagnostic Testing Program began in 1985, under which tests were administered in the&#13;
sixth grade and sixth year to a sample of students nationwide. In 1985 tests were administered on&#13;
the four basic subjects in the sixth grade, and in 1986 in the sixth year in Spanish, mathematics,&#13;
English, physics, chemistry and biology. These sample tests were repeated in 1987 but were&#13;
suspended in 1988 and 1989. A third round of testing began in 1992 in a sampling of 10 schools&#13;
in four provinces, with tests on the six subjects mentioned above and in the third and sixth years.&#13;
Finally, we should note the important precedent established by the work of the Center for the&#13;
Study of Educational Quality (CECE) which in recent years has been administering tests of&#13;
Spanish and mathematics among a sampling of 30 schools in Panama City. The purpose of these&#13;
tests is to bring about positive reactions from students, teachers and parents in order to define&#13;
ways to improve the quality of education.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
* To systematically and periodically assess the achievement of written and actual curriculum&#13;
objectives in strategic grades and years of primary and intermediate education, in order to&#13;
provide reliable, valid data that can be used in decision-making that will influence the&#13;
improvement of education in Panama and the assessment of the Basic Education Project's&#13;
impact.&#13;
* To sponsor the specific emergence of curricular application models and/or modernization of&#13;
curricular offerings, so that graduates of the system will be able to efficiently join the&#13;
country's economic system and contribute effectively towards achieving peace.&#13;
*  To evaluate the level of school readiness in terms of cognitive, emotional and psychomotor&#13;
skills of children entering first grade, in order to contribute towards assessing programs to&#13;
improve preschool education.&#13;
* To investigate the relationship between academic achievement and contextual variables of the&#13;
student, teacher, school, home and community.&#13;
* To evaluate socio-emotional factors of students in order to analyze the influence of such&#13;
factors on academic achievement.&#13;
. To achieve institutional, professional and material strengthening of this component's&#13;
executing unit: the National Educational Quality Assessment System (SINECE).&#13;

3.    The results of achievement, school readiness and socio-emotional tests under this&#13;
subcomponent are quantified by: items produced, tests administered, reports produced, and&#13;
dissemination of results obtained. For research projects on contextual variables and research on&#13;
the impact of data, the results are quantified in questions for surveys, surveys administered and&#13;
report preparation.&#13;
4.    The quantities of each of these results in each year of the Basic Education Project's&#13;
implementation are presented in Annex N° 3 as product indicators.&#13;
Description&#13;
5.    This subcomponent is comprised  of six projects: a) preparation, validation and&#13;
administration of achievement tests; b) research - efforts to modernize curricular performance; c)&#13;
preparation, validation and administration of the school readiness test for children entering first&#13;
grade; d) preparation, validation and administration of socio-emotional tests; e) research on the&#13;
relationship between contextual variables of the student, teacher and school and the student's&#13;
academic achievement and socio-emotional variables; f) research on the impact and use of data&#13;
produced by the administration of achievement, school readiness, and socio-emotional tests.&#13;
Annex N° I contains a detailed timetable of tasks.&#13;
6.    Achievement tests. Achievement tests will be prepared, validated and administered for&#13;
the four basic subjects: Spanish, mathematics, natural sciences and social sciences. Starting in&#13;
1996, these tests will be administered to a random nationwide sampling of 10% of third and sixth&#13;
grade students in primary school and of the third and sixth years of secondary school. In even&#13;
years testing will be administered to third grade and third year students, and in odd years to sixth&#13;
grade and sixth year students.&#13;
7.    Research  - Efforts to modernize curricular implementation.   The results of&#13;
achievement tests and later of socio-emotional tests will be used to carry out information and&#13;
incentive efforts so that teachers, students and parents can seek ways to improve curricular&#13;
implementation. This research will be performed annually starting in 1996, with samples from 30&#13;
schools throughout all of the country's provinces.&#13;
8.    School readiness test. A test of school readiness in terms of cognitive, emotional and&#13;
psychomotor skills will be developed and validated for children entering the first grade of&#13;
elementary school. This test will be administered to a stratified random sampling of 5% of&#13;
children entering first grade, beginning in 1998. The data obtained will be used to assess current&#13;
preschool education programs and those financed by the Basic Education Project.&#13;
9.    Socio-emotional tests.  Beginning in 1999, tests will be developed and validated to&#13;
measure socio-emotional variables that complement the assessment of students' achievements in&#13;
elementary and secondary schools. These tests will be administered to the same sampling of&#13;
students who take the achievement tests.&#13;

10.   Research on contextual variables. In order to better understand the factors that affect&#13;
students' academic achievement, correlating and ex post facto studies will be performed to relate&#13;
the contextual variables of the student, teacher, school and community with the outcome of&#13;
achievement and socio-emotional tests. This research will use surveys and interviews that will be&#13;
administered in parallel with achievement tests, beginning in 1996.&#13;
11.   Research on the impact of data. A system to assess Educational Quality provides data&#13;
that should be used to provide feedback on the educational system, thereby indicating any failures&#13;
that may be found, and to improve education. It is therefore important to research whether the&#13;
data produced is being properly disseminated and if it is having a positive effect on the&#13;
educational system. This work will be performed beginning in 1997 and each year thereafter.&#13;
12.   In addition to these projects, a training, consulting, internship and post-graduate study&#13;
program  has been established to support the projects described above.  Administrative&#13;
programming has been separated to ensure the proper, necessary support for the implementation&#13;
of each measurement, assessment and research activity under this subcomponent. Besides the&#13;
product indicators in Annex N° 3, Annex N° 2 details the process indicators to achieve better&#13;
monitoring of the subcomponent.&#13;
Implementation of the Subcomponent&#13;
13.   The Educational Quality Assessment System (SINECE) has been established to implement&#13;
this subcomponent, with the structure indicated in figure N° 1. A detailed description of the&#13;
outline and functions of each element of this organizational chart may be found in the descriptive&#13;
supplementary document on this subcomponent (previous consultancy report of July 1995).&#13;

PRE-PRMARY&#13;
EXPANSION OF NON-FORMAL PRE-PRIMARY EDUCATION&#13;
1.    Background. It is mandatory that pre-primary school services be provided, but it is not&#13;
mandatory that parents send their children to pre-primary school. It consists of nursery school&#13;
(Pre-jardines de Infancia) for four-year-olds, and kindergarten (Jardines de Infancia) for five-&#13;
year-olds. Jardines de Infancia are one-year schooling programs that emphasize readiness for&#13;
reading and writing. There are about 33,000 children enrolled in 894 Jardines de Infancia.&#13;
About two thirds of these are public institutions, and the remainder are private. The majority of&#13;
kindergarten students attend classes in primary school buildings. About 45 percent of five-year-&#13;
olds are enrolled in kindergarten, a figure significantly lower than other Latin American countries&#13;
of similar income level. In addition, the enrollment is concentrated in the richest CorregimienJos&#13;
and is almost non-existent in the poor rural areas. Thus, the current program serves mostly the&#13;
wealthy provinces with a curriculum developed for implementation by highly educated teachers.&#13;
2.    But, at the same time, Panama began, few years ago, developing a pilot program, the&#13;
Community and Family Center for Initial Education (CEFACEI), to provide community-based&#13;
pre-primary services for four- and five-year-olds. The CEFACEIs use infrastructure provided by&#13;
the community and a community educator (promotora), with or without formal training, to&#13;
provide educational services to 15-21 children. At this time, there are approximately 1,600&#13;
children in 88 centers located in rural and marginal urban areas. Up until now, it has operated&#13;
only in communities that can afford to pay a promotora. The CEFACEI program is an alternative&#13;
for rural and poor areas where it is difficult to retain highly qualified teachers. However, the&#13;
curriculum must be presented to poorly educated parents and community educators through clear&#13;
and simple messages conveyed through appealing educational materials. The existing pre-primary&#13;
curriculum is presented in excessively technical terms that require interpretation by highly trained&#13;
teachers. The majority of CEFACEI promotoras are therefore limited to child care activities.&#13;
3 .    This component aims to: i) expand coverage of non-formal pre-primary education among&#13;
the poor to increase national coverage from 45.5 percent to 75.0 percent for five year-olds and, ii)&#13;
improve the quality of non-formal pre-primary education. Coverage expansion will be based&#13;
primarily on the CEFACEI (Family and Community Education Center) model. At the same time,&#13;
a pilot program for rural areas of scattered population will also be developed.&#13;
4.    The CEFACEI program. The project aims to open 400 new CEFACEIs, and serve&#13;
approximately 20,000 pre-primary-age children over the life of the project. A pilot Mother-to-&#13;
Mother program will also be implemented, to benefit approximately 1.800 pre-primary-age&#13;
children in dispersed, rural communities. The quality of non-formal pre-primary education will be&#13;
improved through intensive training of MOE supervisors and promoloras, the distribution of&#13;
specially designed manuals for promotoras, children and parents, and the transmission of radio&#13;
programs to reinforce the program and encourage healthy child rearing practices. A national team&#13;
will be formed within the Directorate of Initial Education of MOE, to coordinate implementation&#13;
of the component at the national level.&#13;
5.    A pyramid strategy will be developed for training and supervision of the program, to&#13;
facilitate the full involvement of the national, regional, provincial and local levels. The national&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82                                  ANNEX 8&#13;
PRE-PRIMARY&#13;
team will appoint pre-primary supervisors at the provincial level, who will be trained by national&#13;
and international technical assistants to design the manuals for trainers and promotoras (one&#13;
manual for trainers, one for promotoras, one for parents and one for each child). Provincial&#13;
supervisors will conduct a meeting in each community targeted by the project, to convey the&#13;
importance of pre-primary education to parents, and form a local CEFACEI Parents' Association.&#13;
6.    The Parents' Association will be responsible for: i) finding a location for the CEFACEI;&#13;
ii) collaborating in the opening and functioning of the CEFACEI; iii) selecting the promotora&#13;
according to a profile specified by the Directorate of Initial Education; and iv) paid the&#13;
Promotoras with the funds received from MOE every three months, the amount determined by&#13;
the number of children attending the CEFACEI. The Promotora will be paid US$90 per child per&#13;
year. Implemented gradually, the program will open 100 new CEFACEIs per year. The financial&#13;
resources to pay the Promotoras will be provided by the Government as counterpart funds to the&#13;
Bank loan.&#13;
7.    The Mother-to-Mother Program. In rural areas with scattered population mothers will&#13;
be encouraged to make team work, under the guidance of a Mother-Leader, and with the help of&#13;
educational material and radio programs to improve their child-rearing practices. Training of the&#13;
mother-leaders will be the responsibility of the supervisors and pre-primary education specialists&#13;
in each provincial office of MOE. Ten regional MOE supervisors will be trained for 10 days in&#13;
year I and ten days in year 2 of the project. They will train the 300 mother-leaders, chosen by the&#13;
participating mothers, for seven days each. Thirty mother-leaders will be trained each year. It is&#13;
estimated that each participating mother is raising an average of 2.0 children. Therefore, 2,400&#13;
children will benefit directly from the project.&#13;
8.    As in the case of the CEFACEIs, a pyramid strategy will be developed for training and&#13;
supervision of the program, to facilitate the full involvement of the national, regional, provincial&#13;
and local levels. Interested communities will then select a woman to be trained as a mother leader.&#13;
Each supervisor will work with a group of about 15 mother leaders throughout their two-year&#13;
tenure. He/she will give an initial six-day training workshop, focusing on the following topics: i)&#13;
the circumstances of childhood in rural areas and in particular, in each community where the&#13;
mother leaders reside; ii) group dynamics; and iii) analysis of the Mother-to-Mother Program,&#13;
including materials and implementation. The supervisor will supplement this initial training with&#13;
four more three-day workshops over the two-year period, and periodic monitoring of the progress&#13;
of each mother leader.&#13;
9.    Each mother leader will train a group of 10 mothers to instruct their pre-primary-age&#13;
children for two years, in a series of weekly or weekly meetings. Each mother will be instructed&#13;
in a series of thematic units and provided with a set of manuals for use with her children.&#13;
Implementation of the Mother-to-Mother Program will be gradual, concentrating efforts in only&#13;
two or two provinces: Veraguas and Chiriqui.&#13;
10.   Mother-leaders will be paid on a per mother-participant basis, that is, they will receive&#13;
US$ 32 per year for each participating mother they train in bi-weekly meetings over a ten-month&#13;
period. Funds to pay the mother-leaders will be transferred from the central office of MOE to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
83                                   ANNEX 8&#13;
PRE-PRIMARY&#13;
bank accounts of the regional MOE offices. MOE's supervisors will monitor the number of&#13;
mothers being taught, in order to ensure appropriate payment of the mother-leaders.  The&#13;
financial resources to pay the mother-leaders will be provided by the Government as counterpart&#13;
funding for the Bank loan&#13;
11.   The current curriculum will be revised to stress simple problem-solving, self-care and&#13;
school readiness skills. The emphasis will be on an open, flexible curriculum focused on the child&#13;
with parental participation. The strategy for producing a simple core curriculum will be to focus&#13;
on making each concept operational in training manuals. Two types of manuals will be produced:&#13;
manuals to train the promotoras in the use of the new curriculum, and manuals for the promotoras&#13;
to use in teaching. The manuals will be adapted to address rural mother-leaders and mothers&#13;
participating in the program, both of which have very little formal education. The adapted manual&#13;
will be a simplified, shorter version, relying heavily on drawings and visual messages. Thus, a&#13;
total of four manuals will be produced. A special working group will be formed within the&#13;
Directorate of Initial Education to produce the manuals with national and international technical&#13;
assistance. The project will finance the technical assistance to produce the manuals.&#13;
12.   Radio Programs. The current pre-primary programs, both, formal and CEFACEIs, fail to&#13;
involve parents, which is crucial as the dominant share of intelligence develops in early childhood.&#13;
Radio programs are an alternative to involve parents, enhance their ability to create learning&#13;
situations for their kids, and it does it in a simple and appealing way. Radio programs also&#13;
provide Promotoras and Mother-Leaders with effective reinforcement to the training and to the&#13;
written educational materials they will receive. Radio is accessible to everybody, and, what is&#13;
important within the project, to the poor. Radio is part of their daily life, especially in remote&#13;
areas. Radio is used in Panama to help families to communicate messages, for example, messages&#13;
from travelers from remote rural areas to relatives in the towns. Radio is not as expensive as&#13;
other media like TV. Another advantage is the fact that the country, as almost all countries, has&#13;
human resources acquainted with the production of messages for radio.&#13;
13.   A set of 40 radio programs of 5-7 minutes each will be produced by a team of local and&#13;
international consultants during the first and second year of the project. The content of the&#13;
programs will be mainly instructions to perform a set of activities geared toward selected&#13;
objectives of early childhood development.&#13;
14.   Local radio stations from the provinces are willing to broadcast the programs. It is&#13;
expected that some I I small radio stations will participate in the project. Each program will be&#13;
broadcast twice every week and, at the end of the 40'h week they will be broadcast again.&#13;
15.   Demand for pre-primary education will be promoted through the following: i) display&#13;
of posters detailing the CEFACEI and Mother-to-Mother Programs in public places such as town&#13;
halls, health centers, churches, schools, supermarkets, etc.; ii) distribution of pamphlets about the&#13;
different programs, targeted to parents and community-based organizations; iii) distribution of&#13;
brochures about the different programs to governors, mayors, municipal staff, school directors,&#13;
community directors, etc.&#13;
&#13;

Economic Bcnefits&#13;
ECONOMIC BENEFITS&#13;
Component: Improving Quality and Equity in Basic Education&#13;
1.    Project Benefits. This component will provide high quality basic education (grades I to&#13;
9) for 183,909 students (41% of the age-group) from poor families. The cost of this component is&#13;
US$30.8 million (including contingent costs), which account for 53% of the total project costs.&#13;
Improving the quality of basic education will generate three kinds of benefits: the increased&#13;
productivity (increased earnings)of the beneficiaries; the positive externalities resulting from their&#13;
improved social achievements (e.g., reduced crime rates and better informed citizens); and the&#13;
distributional gains (future poverty reduction) resulting from targeting the beneficiaries in poor&#13;
localities (corregimientos).&#13;
2.    This ex-ante economic evaluation has considered only the likely productivity gains that&#13;
will be induced by improving the quality of basic education. The reported Internal Rates of Return&#13;
(IR(R), therefore, are conservative estimates of the project worth. The approach here used is based&#13;
on the premise that in market economies differences in eaming results from differences in&#13;
productivity. In the case of this project productivity will result from improving the quality of&#13;
primary and junior high education. On that premise the project's earning differentiais due to better&#13;
education of the individuals who will benefit from this component represents the economic&#13;
benefits of increased productivity.&#13;
3.    Project Costs. The opportunity cost of a project that improves education quality is given&#13;
by the value of the additional inputs. They include: in-service teacher training; educational&#13;
materials; primary school rehabilitation; and education assessment systems.&#13;
4.    Since improving of education quality reduce the dropout and failure rates, the fiscal cost&#13;
of delivering schooling is reduced. These savings of education resources were discounted from&#13;
the above opportunity cost (or altematively were added to the project benefits).&#13;
5.    Project Worth. The IRR for education investment is the discount rate at which the net&#13;
present value of benefits (increases in earnings as a proxy for productivity) minus costs equal&#13;
zero. That is, if the additional eamings induced by the project would allow students through their&#13;
working life to repay the cost of their improved education plus interests, the implicit rate of&#13;
interest is called the IZRR. If the resulting IRR was higher than the social productivity of capital in&#13;
Panama, the project is economically worth way.&#13;
6.    The social IRR of the component 'Improvement of the Quality of Basic Education', varies&#13;
between 15% and 24%, depending on the scenario. The scenarios refer to alternative impacts of&#13;
the project on educational achievements, and of educational achievements on future eamings.&#13;
Given the above estimates of the social IRR, this project component is economically feasible and&#13;
its undertaking definitely justifiable (see Table 2).&#13;
&#13;

Economic Bencfits&#13;
Savings from the Expansion of the Non-Formal Preschool Component&#13;
7.    Savings from the preschool component will come as a result of expanding CEFACEI&#13;
preschool program (community-administered pre-primary centers) and carrying out a mother-to-&#13;
mother pilot program in rural areas (participating mothers will be trained to teach their preschool-&#13;
age children).&#13;
8.    In Panama the enrollment ratio of pre-primary education is only 29 percent, significant&#13;
lower than that in countries such as Costa Rica and Chile. And the majority of enrollment are&#13;
concentrated in urban areas thereby making it difficult for most children from rural areas to gain&#13;
access into pre-primary education. In order to make it equitable and provide children with the&#13;
early sensory stimulation to develop their intelligence and prepare for reading, writing and&#13;
learning, this component aims to increase the coverage of pre-primary education and develop&#13;
readiness skills for primary education. The low costs of community-oriented initial education&#13;
programs (CEFACEI and Mother-to-Mother) would allow the benefits to reach children from&#13;
low-income families.&#13;
9.    The annual average cost per formal preschool child is US$288 based on the Ministry of&#13;
Education's 1993 data. With the CEFACEI program, the cost per child is only US$124. The&#13;
project would provide preschool education for 42,340 preschool-age children during the life of&#13;
the project. The savings from CEFACEI program is about US$7 million (Tables 3, 4, 5). With&#13;
the mother-to-mother program, the cost per child is US$243. This program would benefit 3,000&#13;
children in rural areas, thus the savings from this program is US$ 13 5,000. Combining the savings&#13;
from CEFACEI and Mother-to-Mother programs, the total savings for the component will be&#13;
US$7.1 million. This is not only significant savings on public expenditures, but also an efficient&#13;
way of improving equity in preschool education and alleviating poverty, especially in the rural&#13;
areas.&#13;
Savings from the Lower Secondary Scholarship Program&#13;
10.   Lower secondary scholarship program and unit costs: This program would sponsor a&#13;
total of 9600 lower-secondary students from rural areas with low density population. In these&#13;
areas there are no secondary schools at all because of the scarcity of secondary school-age&#13;
population. The students from poor family are excluded from secondary school system because&#13;
their parents cannot afford transportation and other necessary costs for them to travel certain&#13;
distance to go to nearby lower secondary schools. The rationale of the program is to provide&#13;
financial support to students from the rural low-income families, thus allowing them to attend&#13;
lower secondary schools. The amount per scholarship is US$3 15 per year. The total costs for&#13;
secondary scholarship program would be about US$3 million over the life of the project (see table&#13;
6).&#13;
11.   The other alternative to provide opportunities for rural secondary school-age children to&#13;
have access to the system is building new schools. However, we have to keep in mind that in&#13;
rural areas, each town or village has fewer secondary school-age children than in urban areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
101                                 ANNEX 13&#13;
Economic Benefits&#13;
This means that the class size of rural areas is much more smaller than in urban areas. Assumning&#13;
that each class has 15 students, we would need to build 640 classroom and hire 640 more&#13;
teachers for approximately 9600 students. The unit cost for construction and equipment per&#13;
classroom is estimated at US$25,000 and the average teacher's annual salary is US$5,404. The&#13;
total cost for this option would be on the order of US$19.5 million. Obviously, the cost for&#13;
building schools is much higher than the cost for scholarships. Of course, the classrooms can be&#13;
used for many years. Realistically, however, in these rural areas, the utilization of these buildings&#13;
is extremely low and the cost to run and maintain them would be just as high as the other&#13;
buildings. Therefore, this is not an efficient way to expand rural lower secondary enrollment.&#13;
12.   Based on the comparison of the two options, it is clear that the scholarship program has&#13;
more advantages than the other. The savings from scholarship program would be about US$16&#13;
million.&#13;

Supervision Plans and Reviews&#13;
SUPERVISION PLANS AND REVIEWS&#13;
1.    The composition and staffing level of the supervision program for each year of&#13;
project implementation are presented in Table 1. The supervision teams will consist of the&#13;
Task Manager, EBRD staff and consultants with expertise in the areas of education (pre-&#13;
primary, evaluation, teacher training, textbooks), Management Information Systems,&#13;
education finance and planning, procurement and project implementation. Supervision&#13;
missions will normally be conducted twice a year, in February and September, beginning in&#13;
July 1996. All missions will involve discussions with project officials as well as project&#13;
field visits, on the basis of which the mission will evaluate the project.&#13;
2.    Project Launch Seminar. A Project Launch Seminar will be conducted around&#13;
April 1996 to: (a) review implementation of the project's rules and procedures manual,&#13;
and familiarize the MOE with the project's monitoring procedures and banks guidelines&#13;
and procedures on procurement, disbursement and auditing requirements; and (b) review&#13;
the project requirements for progress reports on the implementation of the Annual Work&#13;
Programs.&#13;
3.    Annual Review. The purpose of the annual review is to assess project&#13;
performance against specific output and impact indicators, primarily through the analysis&#13;
of: (a) the Project Implementation Schedule (Annex 14); (b) the Annual Implementation&#13;
Plan for the following year; and (c) the Annual Implementation Report of the previous&#13;
year. Annual Reviews will take place in September of each year.&#13;
4.    Annual Reviews will be held by September 15 of each year by MOE, MIPPE, FES&#13;
and IFARHU. In preparation for the Annual Project Review, the PCU Coordinator, in&#13;
coordination with responsible units, will prepare and present to the Bank, no later than&#13;
September 1 st of each year, the following documents.&#13;
(I)   compliance with the Project Operations Manual;&#13;
(ii)   compliance with the covenants of the Bank Loan Agreement;&#13;
(iii)  information pertaining to all Project Monitoring Indicators (Output and&#13;
Impact Indicators);&#13;
(iv)   status of procurement of goods and services;&#13;
(v)   highlights of findings, lessons learned and problems pertaining to the&#13;
technical, institutional, administrative or financial implementation of the&#13;
project.&#13;

Supervision Plans and Reviews&#13;
(I)   program of activities for each subcomponent of the project;&#13;
(ii)   schedule of activities for each subcomponent of the project;&#13;
(iii)  detailed procurement plan;&#13;
(iv)   detailed budget by source of funds and uses, for each quarter, specifying&#13;
counterpart funds;&#13;
(v)   specific reports when needed.&#13;
5.    Project Mid-Term Review. This review will be carried out on Sept 1998 jointly&#13;
by the Government and IiBRD. The focus of the review is to ascertain to what extent the&#13;
project has achieved its development objectives. The PAU Coordinator will prepare the&#13;
same reports for the Project Mid-Term Review as for the Annual Project Reviews.&#13;
6.    Modirications to Project Design and Implementation Plans. During Annual&#13;
Project Reviews and the Project Mid-Term Review, there is the opportunity to update&#13;
project targets and discuss changes needed in project design or implementation plans. In&#13;
this context IBRD may require that the PAU prepare an action plan for the Bank's review&#13;
and approval within two months following the completion of the Project Review. The&#13;
PCU Coordinator will be responsible for organizing the Mid-Term Project Review and&#13;
ensuring that agreed follow-up actions, satisfactory to the Bank, are taken in timely&#13;
manner.&#13;
