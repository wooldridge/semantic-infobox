Global Scaling Up Rural Sanitation is a WSP project focused on learning how to combine the&#13;
approaches of CLTS, behavior change communications, and social marketing of sanitation to&#13;
generate sanitation demand and strengthen the supply of sanitation products and services at&#13;
scale, leading to improved health for people in rural areas. It is a large-scale effort to meet the basic&#13;
sanitation needs of the rural poor who do not currently have access to safe and hygienic sanitation.&#13;
Local and national governments are implementing the project with technical support from WSP.&#13;

The baseline survey conducted in Indonesia captures a repre-     data, will enable a close examination of the links between&#13;
sentative sample of households living in rural East Java with    poor sanitation, poor health, and longer-term child devel-&#13;
young children. These households are poor relative to the na-    opment. The baseline survey identifies large proportions&#13;
tional average. Only 49% of households have access to im-        of children in East Java as being underweight, stunted,&#13;

report washing their hands after defecating, handwashing fa-     demonstrates poor cognitive and physical development.&#13;
cilities are often not available. Access to improved drinking    The impact evaluation aims to identify to what extent&#13;
water is relatively high at 87%, even among the poor, but the    these outcomes are attributable to poor sanitation and to&#13;
remaining population consumes water from unsafe sources.         quantify the extent to which the project is able to improve&#13;
Amidst these conditions, 8.4% of children under five years of    these vital aspects of child health.&#13;
age are reported as having had diarrhea in the past two weeks.&#13;
                                                                 As outlined in the methodology section, the impact evalua-&#13;

Annex 1: Baseline Comparison of Means&#13;
Tests for Balance&#13;
As mentioned in Section II: Methodology, a critical require-                        The null hypothesis of mean equality at the 10% level was&#13;
ment of the IE methodology is that a robust counterfactual                          rejected in 27 of the 229 variables tested, with 11.8% of re-&#13;
for the treatment group can be approximated. The households                         sponses showing statistically significant differences between&#13;
surveyed possess many characteristics that are either unob-                         the treatment and control groups (at        0.1 level).&#13;
servable, or for which data were not collected, and thus bal-&#13;
ance between the groups on these unobservable characteristics                       The table shows that for the key outcome variables (house-&#13;
cannot be tested. However, if a sufficiently large number of                        hold water and sanitation condition, as well as children's&#13;
observed characteristics are found to be balanced across the                        disease and health variables), balance is achieved. In gen-&#13;
treatment and control groups, then we can be reasonably con-                        eral, there are no significant differences in most demo-&#13;
fident that the unobserved characteristics are balanced as well.                    graphic and socio-economic characteristics between&#13;
                                                                                    treatment and control groups. One key difference to note:&#13;
The following table presents a series of mean comparison                            on average, the treatment group has a slightly higher num-&#13;
tests across treatment and control groups for key variables. A                      ber of household members and children under five. In ad-&#13;
variable is "balanced" if the mean differences between the                          dition, the treatment group also has more household&#13;
treatment and control groups are not statistically different                        members with tertiary degrees, although this may have&#13;

mean and standard error calculations across all observations.                       share of households in the treatment groups with access to&#13;

Overall, 229 variables were tested for balance across treat-                        of households that use spring water as their main source of&#13;
ment and control groups in the Indonesia sample. Statisti-                          drinking water is higher. Again, this may be due to sample&#13;
cally significant differences found at           0.1 level are                      size becoming too small when we break down into specific&#13;

            Scaling up rural sanitation : findings from
            the impact evaluation baseline survey in Indonesia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall purpose of the Impact
            Evaluation is to provide decision makers with a body of
            rigorous evidence on the effects of the hand washing and
            sanitation projects at scale on a set of relevant outcomes.
            It also aims to generate robust evidence on a cross-country
            basis, understanding how effects vary according to each
            country's programmatic and geographic contexts, and
            generate knowledge of relevant impacts such as child
            cognitive development, child growth (anthropometric)
            measures, anemia, acute lower respiratory disease, and
            productivity of mother's time, among many others. The
            studies will provide a better understanding of at-scale
            sanitation and hygiene interventions. The improved evidence
            will support development of large-scale policies and
            programs, and will inform donors and policy makers on the
            effectiveness and potential of the Global Scaling Up
            projects as massive interventions to meet global needs.
