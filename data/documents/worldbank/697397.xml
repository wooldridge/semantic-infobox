REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN&#13;
SOCIAL PROTECTION PROJECT&#13;
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:           Republic of Kazakhstan&#13;
Beneficiaries:      Ministry of Labor&#13;
Oblast governments of South Kazakhstan and Paviodar Oblasts&#13;
City governments of Shymkent, Kentau, Lenger, Pavlodar, and Aksu&#13;
Poverty Category:   Program of Targeted Interventions. Because the unemployed includes a greater&#13;
proportion of poor people than in the population at large, and the poor has less&#13;
access to private social facilities, their benefit under the project would be&#13;
substantially larger than their proportion in the overall population.&#13;
Amount:             US$ 41.1 million&#13;
Terms:              17 years, including 5 years of grace, at the World Bank's standard variable&#13;
interest rate.&#13;
Project Objectives:   The project seeks to assist the Borrower to: (a) develop the capacity of the&#13;
Employment Service in the Department of Employment of the Ministry of Labor&#13;
to manage the expected increase in the number of registered unemployed and&#13;
attendant benefit claims following the restructuring and privatization of&#13;
enterprises; and (b) ensure continued delivery of essential social services, by&#13;
promoting orderly divestiture of social assets from enterprises, and efficient&#13;
management by municipalities of a unified system of social services. The project&#13;
would be implemented with a view to determining suitable models for the design&#13;
and implementation of a comprehensive national strategy for the divestiture of&#13;
enterprise social assets, thereby removing obstacles to restructuring, and&#13;
enhancing the competitiveness of enterprises. The project would provide the&#13;
institutional underpinning for the implementation of social policies supported by&#13;
the SAL.&#13;
Project Description:  The project has two main components: an Employment Service Component, to&#13;
be implemented at both the national and regional levels; and a Social Services&#13;
Component, to be implemented in South Kazakhstan and Pavlodar oblasts.&#13;
The Employment Service Component seeks to strengthen the institutional&#13;
capacity of the ES to register the unemployed and calculate and pay&#13;
unemployment benefits; provide a more effective service to unemployed job&#13;
seekers; and analyze labor markets and formulate labor market policies. It will&#13;
also develop a sharper focus for training and retraining of the unemployed,&#13;
particularly women and youth, through orienting the work of the ES towards&#13;
promoting demand-driven training and through a greater use of external training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page ii                                                               Loan and Project Summary&#13;
providers.  Financing under this component will support:  (a) institutional&#13;
strengthening of the ES; (b) development and implementation of a simplified&#13;
unemployment benefit (UB) system; (c) training and development of staff; and&#13;
(d) a pilot program in South Kazakhstan and Pavlodar oblasts and Almaty to&#13;
strengthen counselling and training of the unemployed.&#13;
The Social Services Component will facilitate the transfer of essential social&#13;
services from restructuring enterprises to local governments, and rationalize&#13;
management of all basic social services in five selected cities -- South&#13;
Kazakhstan Oblast: Shymkent City, Kentau, Lenger; and Pavlodar Oblast:&#13;
Pavlodar City, and Aksu.  Local social service budget management will be&#13;
reformed and social assistance targeting improved.  While many socially&#13;
important facilities are run by the enterprises, the project will focus only on basic&#13;
social services such as health care and early education, which are critical&#13;
elements of the social safety net. To this end, the project will finance modest&#13;
rehabilitation and upgrading of, and purchases of critical equipment and supplies&#13;
for, facilities that are to be sustained over the long run, including: health&#13;
(rehabilitation of hospitals and primary health care facilities and purchases of&#13;
essential medical equipment, vaccines, drugs, and supplies), and (b) education&#13;
(rehabilitation of kindergartens and purchases of books and training materials).&#13;
Incremental recurrent costs will be financed for the divested facilities on a&#13;
declining basis, with counterpart contributions from the Governmenlt&#13;
Benefits:             The policy making capacity of the Employment Service will be improved, and&#13;
the basis laid for a program of social protection for retrenched workers. The&#13;
provision of an effective social safety net would remove constraints on labor&#13;
mobility and improve public support for the Government's economic strategy.&#13;
Enterprise restructuring will be facilitated in the selected cities by the orderly&#13;
divestiture of social services. The project will foster rationalization of local&#13;
social service budget management and improve public social investment programs&#13;
in the selected cities. Improvements in the cost effectiveness of local social&#13;
expenditure will have a net positive impact on the central budget, reducilng the&#13;
need for increased budgetary allocations resulting from divestiture, while&#13;
allowing local governments to operate additional divested social services.&#13;
Experience with the rationalization programs in the two oblasts would facilitate&#13;
replication/improvement of the approach subsequently throughout the country.&#13;
Risks:                In a newly created country undergoing fundamental economic transformation,&#13;
there is an inevitable risk of policy changes and implementation delays. The&#13;
project faces five main risks: (i) the Government's limited experience with Bank-&#13;
financed projects and overall limited administrative capacity; (ii) the complexity&#13;
of the issues to be addressed; (iii) introduction of user fees for health services&#13;
may be delayed because it requires changes in legislation; (iv) the Government&#13;
may find it difficult to sustain the level of management, coordination, and&#13;
budgetary effort necessary to succeed in the divestiture process; and (v) delays&#13;
in implementing policy reformns may jeopardize project implementation. The&#13;
project will help offset these risks by: putting in place strong institutional&#13;
arrangements; implementing the Social Services Component in oblasts/cities&#13;

providing management support and training for the implementation of&#13;
rationalization plans, including building a national capacity through the training&#13;
of financial staff both at the central and oblast/city level; and providing technical&#13;
assistance to the ES to implement improved organizational procedures prior to&#13;
project start-up.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A. Econonmic and Sectoral Background&#13;
1.1        At independence in 1992, Kazakhstan inherited a reasonably well-developed industrial base.&#13;
Industry, dominated by mining and processing activities, accounted for about 40%  of GDP and&#13;
agriculture 34%. Per capita GNP was estimated at US$1,690. However, the economy was characterized&#13;
by inefficiencies common throughout the FSU, including distorted price structures and soft budget&#13;
constraints on enterprises. Trade was heavily dependent on exchanges with other FSU republics,&#13;
especially Russia, which in 1991 accounted for 91 % of exports and 88% of imports.&#13;
1.2        MIedium and long-term prospects for economic growth are good, largely due to the country's&#13;
extensive natural resource base. However, since independence the economic situation in the country has&#13;
deteriorated sharply. GDP declined by 15% per annum in 1992 and by 25% in 1994. During 1994, the&#13;
decline was exacerbated by a severe winter, and continuing difficulties over oil trade with Russia. Output&#13;
suffered from a steep fall in investment expenditures, depressed consumption levels, and cutbacks in&#13;
defense outlays. The monthly inflation accelerated throughout 1993 and early 1994, to peak at 35 percent&#13;
monthly during the second quarter of 1994. It has declined sharply since, to 5 percent a month by March&#13;
1995. This has been in response to the tightening of monetary policy, which followed the inter-enterprise&#13;
arrears refinancing of April 1994. In addition, the level of inter-enterprise arrears rose rapidly, reaching&#13;
an amount comparable to total outstanding bank credit to enterprises by March 1994. While registered&#13;
unemployment has remained low (para 1.5), real average wages fell by 30% in 1992, 7% in 1993, and&#13;
an estimated 23% in 1994.&#13;
1.3        The Government's reform program progressed well initially, before stalling somewhat in&#13;
1993 and the first half of 1994. A new Government tearn appointed in October 1994 and confirmed in&#13;
March 1995 has shown greater conmmitment to deepening critical reforms. Enterprise restructuring and&#13;
privatization have been important elements of the program, with the adoption of a three-pronged approach&#13;
to privatization, embodied in a "National Privatization program for 1993-95." Under the small scale&#13;
privatization program (under 200 employees), about 2,900 establishments had been privatized by the end&#13;
of 1994, and a further 4,000 have been earnarked for sale by the end of 1995. In the mass privatization&#13;
program (for firms with 200 to 5,000 employees), 275 enterprises had been offered for sale by September&#13;
1994, of a total of around 2,500 earmarked by the Government. Under the case-by-case privatization&#13;
of large scale enterprises, the State Comrnittee on Privatization is planning to issue by June 1995,&#13;
consultant tenders for the sale of at least 10 large enterprises through case by case tenders and another&#13;
15 during the rest of the year. It is expected that the committee will have finalized, by the end of 1995,&#13;
at least 10 major transactions. Overall, privatization in the agricultural sector was proceeding ahead of&#13;
schedule as of the fourth quarter of 1994, with 850 state farms privatized or undergoing privatization by&#13;
the end of 1994, bringing to 1,455 the total number of state farms that are undergoing or have completed&#13;
the privatization process (two thirds of the total number of state farms).&#13;
Ihe Labor Market&#13;
1.4        Under the Soviet system, employment was guaranteed, and cash wages were low and&#13;
relatively compressed. Wages were not related to productivity, resulting in low returns to labor.&#13;
Enterprises functioned both as productive units and instruments of state social protection policy. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 2                                                                                 Chapter I&#13;
encouraged overstaffing, which is estimated to have been in the range of 20-30 %. In addition, non-cash&#13;
income constituted a substantial proportion of labor remuneration: housing, kindergartens, health&#13;
facilities, food stores, and other facilities. In 1992, non-cash income was estimated at over 40% of total&#13;
labor compensation. This, and other factors such as the propiska residence permit system, resulted in&#13;
low geographical mobility of labor.&#13;
1.5         As budget constraints on enterprises have increased, the employer response has been to place&#13;
workers on unpaid leave or part-time work, resulting in increasing under-employment. As a result of&#13;
this practice, open unemployment has remained low. The reluctance to formally retrench workers has&#13;
been motivated by a number of factors, including social protection considerations, severance pay&#13;
provisions (para 1.9), and employer expectations of resumed output growth in the medium-term.&#13;
However, as state credits dry up and increasing numbers of enterprises are privatized, enterprises are&#13;
likely to be forced to lay off workers permanently, converting current under-employment to open&#13;
unemployment.&#13;
1.6         Large output falls since 1990 will combine with other factors to increase open&#13;
unemployment, which is estimated to reach 4% by the end of 1995, and around 10% by the end of 19962.&#13;
The duration of unemployment is also expected to increase significantly in the medium-tern, as lay-off&#13;
rates outstrip absorption in the emerging private sector. These developments will increase the potential&#13;
for social dislocation and place new and increasing burdens on the Employment Service (ES).&#13;
Employment Service (ES)&#13;
1.7         The Ministry of Labor (MOL) is responsible for the operation of the ES through the&#13;
Department of Employment (DOE). The ES has offices at the national, oblast (21 offices) and raion (300&#13;
offices) levels, with a total full-time staff of approximately 2,650 (or around 3,650, if ancillary and&#13;
part-time staff are included). The Republic office sets national policy and distributes guidelines to oblasts&#13;
on implementation, in addition to monitoring oblast ES performance. Raion offices are responsible for&#13;
delivery of services, with oblast offices providing management support. Oblast offices have an average&#13;
of 30 staff, and raion offices between 4 and 18 staff. Staff are allocated on a per capita of population&#13;
basis (15:100,000), a norm used in other FSU republics. There have been no attempts to date to relate&#13;
staffing levels to the regional unemployment profile. To ensure that staffing levels reflect actual&#13;
workloads and the labor market needs of particular locations, a simple staffing formula needs to be&#13;
developed (para 3.9) to provide a more flexible method of setting and reviewing staffing levels for each&#13;
office. The challenge facing the ES is to reorient its functions from largely data collection on enterprise&#13;
vacancies to a range of client-oriented services, including registration and payment of unemployment&#13;
benefit (UB), client counseling job information, training and retraining, and temporary employment&#13;
schemes (paras 3.12-3.29).&#13;
1.8         The ES was established in 1991, and is funded by a 2%  payroll tax3.  Initially, the&#13;
Employment Fund (EF) was an extrabudgetary fund, but was absorbed into the budget in 1994. As a&#13;
result of agreements under the SAL in April 1995, the EF became independent of the budget. Further,&#13;
2/          Estimates are based on projections by ES and Bank staff appraisal teams for this project and the SAL .&#13;
3/          Agricultural enterprises and institutions financed direcdy from the state budget have to date been exempted from&#13;
contributions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter I                                                                           Paze 3&#13;
its financial administration will be changed and its financial viability enhanced. Low priority activities&#13;
(including for any wage subsidies and job creation through credit schemes) have been discontinued. The&#13;
use of the EF for non-employment activities has also been discontinued and the expenditures under the&#13;
Fund are now being made in accordance with the Republican Programn of Employment and the current&#13;
labor market situation; however, the Fund will be used to finalize some expenditures, estimated at 250&#13;
million Tenge related to immigration, but this will be completed by the end of 1995. In addition, the&#13;
revenue base for the EF will be broadened; the standard rates of contribution by employers will be&#13;
extended to the agricultural and budgetary sectors by the end of 1995; and an employee-based&#13;
contribution will be introduced over the same time. The levels of both employer and employee&#13;
contributions will be determined from time to time, in the light of developments in the labor market.&#13;
Unemployment Benefits (UB)&#13;
1.9        Unemployment benefits were introduced in 1991, and are financed from the EF. When a&#13;
worker is laid off, the employer must pay two months severance pay. After this period, the individual&#13;
applies for registration as unemployed. If the application is approved, individuals are entitled to six&#13;
months of UB. To date, expenditures on unemployment benefit have been low for a number of reasons,&#13;
including the low number of registered unemployed, overly strict procedures for approval of UB&#13;
payment, there appears to be an element of embarrassment associated with registering as unemployed and&#13;
more particularly with receiving UB. At the end of 1994, 100,000 people were registered as unemployed&#13;
or about 1.4% of the labor force. However, estimates of actual unemployment ranged between 450,000&#13;
and 550,000 (about 6.1% to 7.5% of the labor force). Up to recently, the level of benefit had been&#13;
related to previous earnings and the minimrnum wage (para 3.14).&#13;
1.10       The primary function of the ES should be registration of the unemployed, payment of UB,&#13;
and counseling and referral of clients to employment opportunities or training. An important aspect of&#13;
its reorientation will be to improve the currently low public perception of the role which it can play. This&#13;
will require a range of reforms, including revised staff allocation mechanisms, an improved registration&#13;
system, training of staff, and refitting of offices. In addition, it will be necessary to encourage measures&#13;
such as factory-gate hiring, which could lessen the burden on the ES. In its Letter of Development Policy&#13;
for the SAL, the Government recognizes the social effects of the major increase in open unemployment,&#13;
which has already begun and which is forecast to accelerate in the months ahead. It further recognizes,&#13;
that labor mobility needs to be increased and that workers should move from inefficient activities to new&#13;
areas of productivity and economic growth. The Government recognizes that at present, the system of&#13;
UB has several weaknesses, i.e. the level of benefits is too low to provide any significant relief for the&#13;
unemployed or inducement for employees to accept retrenchment. It further recognizes that the UB&#13;
administration system is unduly complicated and the eligibility for unemployment benefits is overly&#13;
restrictive. The structure of unemployment benefits also needs to be reconsidered in ways which will&#13;
protect those most in need while avoiding work disincentives for other groups. To address this situation,&#13;
the Government will carry out a series of reforms, which are to be implemented under this project&#13;
(paras 3.14-3.16, 3.28 and Annex 1)&#13;
Training and Retraining&#13;
1.11       Training and retraining in Kazakhstan are the responsibility of the Republican Center for&#13;
Vocational Training within the DOE, which is separate from the ES. In addition, each oblast is&#13;
res,&gt; C . i;+ mr retraining the local unemployed population. Training activities are contracted to a range&#13;
tf    .      t - ions, including vocational schools, the Department's own training centers, and private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 4                                                                            Chapter I&#13;
providers. A portion of retraining is still carried out under the multi-party contractual arrangement which&#13;
guarantees trainees a job, although such guarantees are becoming increasingly unenforceable. According&#13;
to the DOE, during the last quarter of 1994, 70% of those undertaking training found jobs at the end of&#13;
the course.&#13;
Temporary Employment Schemes (TES)&#13;
1.12       In Kazakhstan, any person registered as a jobseeker with the ES can participate in temporary&#13;
employment schemes. TES involve a broad range of activities, mostly of a low-skilled nature. During&#13;
1993, 11,300 people participated in TES; 47.7% were registered unemployed; 51 % were young persons&#13;
below 20 years and 6.2% single mothers and mothers with many children. The number had fallen to&#13;
only 4,400 by November 1994. An unemployed person can claim UB or work on TES for a maximum&#13;
of 6 months out of every 12. The overall schedule of payment to participants involves a complex&#13;
calculation of the average wage in the industry where the worker is placed. The wage paid to participants&#13;
in TES cannot be less than the minimum UB plus 15 %.&#13;
Social Protection and Social Services&#13;
1.13       The system of social protection during the Soviet period offered a wide array of cash and&#13;
in-kind benefits, with little targeting of assistance on the basis of need. There was also limited emphasis&#13;
on linking individual contributions to the level of benefits. These factors resulted in relatively high&#13;
benefit expenditures, e.g. public pension expenditures accounted for around 9.5% of GDP in 1993.&#13;
Tightening fiscal constraints since independence have resulted in various reforms, aimed at reining in&#13;
social protection expenditures. There have been attempts to target and reduce expenditures on social&#13;
protection, e.g. through the removal of food subsidies during 1993 and 1994, and the introduction of&#13;
means-testing for family allowances. Real benefit levels have fallen sharply as a result -- pension and&#13;
social assistance benefits are estimated to have declined 27% in real terms in 1994, after falling 26% in&#13;
1993.&#13;
1.14       The entire cash benefit structure has been linked to the minimum wage traditionally.&#13;
However, by March 1994, the minimum wage had fallen to only 12% of the officially calculated poverty&#13;
line, undermining the social protection function of benefits. This has led to use, on an informal basis of&#13;
a simplified food basket for setting some benefits (such as family allowances) and consideration of&#13;
reforms in setting of other benefits (such as UB).&#13;
1.15       In addition to the benefit system, Kazakhstan - similar to other republics of the FSU  -&#13;
maintained social services with high coverage rates and free and universal access. Of total social service&#13;
expenditures, about a third appear to have been made by enterprises. However, since independence, both&#13;
budget and enterprise-financed social services have been subject to sharp cuts in real allocations, though&#13;
the fall is more difficult to estimate in the case of enterprise-financed services, due to lack of transparency&#13;
in credit allocation mechanisms. The welfare impact of the cut is worsened by changes in the relative&#13;
costs of inputs, which have resulted in an increasing share of budgets being spent on staff salaries and&#13;
energy costs, e.g. 80% of the 1994 health budget was allocated to salaries and utilities. The crisis in&#13;
health and education provision has been accelerated by privatization and the beginnings, in 1994, of&#13;
harder budget constraints on enterprises. These have resulted in a range of responses: lower standards&#13;
of service provision, divestiture of social assets to local authorities, closures of facilities, and in some&#13;
cases, continued operation of services by enterprises at the expense of their productive competitiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter I                                                                                  Page 5&#13;
1.16        An existing financing issue which the current fiscal crisis has brought into sharper relief is&#13;
the method of budgetary allocation for social services provided by local authorities. Funds are allocated&#13;
by higher levels of government on the basis of centrally determined norms (e.g. cost per bed; cost per&#13;
student; capital costs per square meter). The budgetary process is increasingly inappropriate in a context&#13;
of rapid devolution of responsibility for social services to the local level. In addition, the allocations&#13;
appear to be inadequate to operate and maintain essential social services. Thus, assumption of additional&#13;
responsibilities for social service provision by local authorities has widened local budget deficits, resulting&#13;
in closure of some education and health facilities, and falling service standards at the others. Both&#13;
municipal and enterprise facilities are operating at minimal levels due to severe lack of critical equipment&#13;
and consumables, and deferred maintenance. In the short-term, however, the sustainability of social&#13;
services depends more on increasing the availability of operating resources than in providing investment&#13;
capital.&#13;
1.17        The position of local authorities is further constrained by the fiscal regime in Kazakhstan,&#13;
which does not give oblasts or raions authority to levy new taxes, or vary the rate of existing taxes. In&#13;
addition, their discretion to set user charges is constrained, e.g. the Presidential Decree capping user&#13;
charges in kindergartens at 30% of food costs. Local authorities thus have extremely limited room for&#13;
manoeuver on both the revenue and expenditure fronts. In some areas, enterprises are alleviating local&#13;
financing difficulties through voluntary sponsorship of social services. In addition, some areas have&#13;
already begun to explore more cost effective methods of service provision e.g. the introduction in&#13;
Shymkent City of the "family doctor" program, which performs many of the functions of polyclinics.&#13;
Divestiture of Social Assets&#13;
1.18        A significant legacy of the Soviet period was the widespread ownership, provision, and&#13;
financing of social services by enterprises. Overall, non-productive social assets accounted for 31 % of&#13;
all capital assets in Kazakhstan at the end of 1991. Of this total, 63% was housing stock owned by&#13;
enterprises, 11% municipal services, 10% health care facilities, and 5% educational facilities. Other&#13;
enterprise social assets included sanatoria, children's summer camps, sport and cultural facilities, and&#13;
subsidized canteens. In many areas, enterprises provided social services not only to current and past&#13;
employees and their families, but also to other members of the surrounding community. The range and&#13;
quality of enterprise social service provision varied according to the size and strategic importance of the&#13;
enterprise.&#13;
1.19        There were significant regional variations in the relative importance of enterprises in the&#13;
provision of essential social services. In many areas (such as the numerous mono-company towns in the&#13;
country) enterprises provided the bulk of certain types of social services e.g. in Ekibastuz, there were&#13;
50 enterprise and only 5 municipal kindergartens in the last quarter of 1994. In other areas (such as&#13;
Shymkent City), enterprises and municipalities provided roughly equivalent numbers of such facilities.&#13;
In other areas (including Almaty City and most rural areas), the majority of social services were&#13;
provided by local authorities. The selected cities under the project include areas where enterprises have&#13;
provided the bulk of essential social services (such as Kentau), and others where provision has been&#13;
divided more evenly between local authorities and enterprises (such as Pavlodar and Shymkent).&#13;
1.20        Much of the investment in social assets by enterprises was made through the Social Fund&#13;
within each enterprise, which absorbed 11 % of all enterprise profits in 1992. The result of such&#13;
expenditure levels in Kazakhstan has been that enterprise-owned social assets are frequently of&#13;
significantly higher quality than budget-financed facilities, both in terms of the structures themselves, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 6                                                                                  Chapter I&#13;
the unit costs of service provision (e.g. costs per child in enterprise kindergartens in selected localities&#13;
in Pavlodar oblast were more than three times the level of budget facilities).&#13;
1.21        The most immediate effect of the transition on enterprise expenditures has been a dramatic&#13;
fall in investment in social asset construction. Between 1991 and 1992, construction by enterprises of&#13;
kindergartens fell by 63 %, of health facilities by 43 %, and of schools by 50%. Project preparation work&#13;
indicates that - at least in South Kazakhstan and Pavlodar oblasts - construction of social assets had ceased&#13;
altogether by 1994, and that budgets for capital repairs and maintenance are under increasing pressure.&#13;
1.22        Although local authorities are assuming ownership and responsibility for divested social&#13;
assets, they have not been given increased budgetary allocations commensurate with the additional social&#13;
service burden. Local responses to this situation have varied according to the proportional increase in&#13;
responsibilities, and the pre-existing fiscal situation and administrative capacity in the locality. In areas&#13;
where local authorities have traditionally provided the bulk of social services, there is some capacity to&#13;
cope with the increased burden, where necessary by absorbing users of enterprise facilities into the&#13;
existing budget-financed system, and closing divested facilities. However, even some of these areas are&#13;
experiencing severe difficulties in meeting the costs of the existing social service system, as evidenced&#13;
by wage payment arrears for teachers in budget-financed educational facilities in several project cities.&#13;
In Kentau, municipal kindergartens were closed in the second half of 1994 due to absence of funds&#13;
(para 3.32).&#13;
B. Government's Reform Strategy&#13;
1.23        The Government's reform strategy aims at achieving macro-economic stabilization and&#13;
implementing structural and sectoral reforms. The key elements of this strategy that have assumed&#13;
priority for the next few years are: (i) developing competitive markets throughout the economy,&#13;
particularly in agriculture; (ii) reforming the enterprise and financial sectors; (iii) putting in place&#13;
adequate social protection policies; and (iv) addressing bottlenecks in infrastructure and energy, and&#13;
cleaning up the environment.&#13;
1.24        The Government is committed to policies which will facilitate the emergence of viable&#13;
private enterprises. Consistent with this premise, its main strategy vis-a-vis the enterprise sector is to&#13;
transform it from a state-owned administered one, into one dominated by privately owned capitalist firms,&#13;
which will operate under competitive market conditions. This will be achieved through both the entry&#13;
of new firms and the privatization of existing ones.&#13;
1.25        The Government recognizes that without a viable social safety net for people living below&#13;
the poverty line and a strategy to ensure the delivery of primary services, the sustainability of the entire&#13;
reform program will be threatened. In the Letter of Development Policy for the SAL, the Government&#13;
states that it will prioritize the development of a national strategy for dealing with divestiture of social&#13;
assets from enterprises, and reformulation of UB policy and delivery mechanisms. These measures have&#13;
been formulated by the Government in tandem with the current project in a Memorandum of&#13;
Understanding (MOU) on Social Asset Divestiture and Unemployment Policy, dated March 25, 1995&#13;
(Annex 1).&#13;
1.26        The MOU outlines the following with respect to social services: (i) the social services which&#13;
are considered essential in terms of continued public provision; (ii) the general service standards to apply&#13;
in the operation of those services by local authorities, including unification of unit costs in existing and&#13;
to-be-divested facilities; (iii) a delineation of responsibility for social service provision between raions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter I                                                                              Page 7&#13;
and oblasts; and (iv) basic principles of cost recovery which are consistent with continued access to&#13;
services by the poor. The Government recognizes the need to rationalize the structure and delivery of&#13;
essential social services, regardless of their origin. With technical assistance under the project, the&#13;
Government plans to complete a comprehensive inventory of enterprise social assets in all oblasts by&#13;
September 1995 and a national strategy for social asset divestiture by December 1995 (para 3.31). Rapid&#13;
progress with privatization has made this a matter of urgency.&#13;
C. The Bank's Role and Assistance Strategy&#13;
1.27       The Bank seeks to support macroeconomic stabilization, strengthen market institutions and&#13;
the private sector, protect various segments of society from economic hardship, and build institutions&#13;
through lending, analytic work and aid coordination. Kazakhstan is in the "high-case" reform scenario.&#13;
It has a coherent stabilization program, which has been supported by an IMF Stand-By Program in 1994.&#13;
Good progress has been made in structural reforms for price and trade liberalization, in the privatization&#13;
program for small, medium and large enterprises, and in beginning to reform the agricultural sector.&#13;
1.28       The Bank's lending will depend, inter alia, on the fulfillment of the IMF program (para&#13;
1.29), and on the Government's willingness to borrow for particular projects. The Bank assistance, to&#13;
be expanded in FY95-97, comprises the following operations: FY95 a Financial and Enterprises&#13;
Development Project (US$62 million), approved in April 1995, the proposed Social Protection Project&#13;
described in this report (US$41.1 million), and a Structural Adjustment Loan (US$180 million), to be&#13;
presented to the Board in early June 1995. The two investment loans will provide the institutional&#13;
underpinning for the implementation of the policies supported by the SAL. The SAL aims at speeding&#13;
the restructuring of the enterprise sector by focusing on measures to eliminate constraints that have been&#13;
preventing such restructuring. The Social Protection Project will assist in the divestiture of enterprise&#13;
social assets and help strengthen the Employment Service.  This would allow acceleration of the&#13;
privatization program as the social responsibilities of state enterprises are transferred to local&#13;
governments. The Finance and Enterprise Development Project will assist in strengthening the payment&#13;
system and creating a Rehabilitation Trust, charged with the restructuring or liquidation of the country's&#13;
largest debtors. In FY96, a Land Titling Project (US$40 million) would support the acceleration of land&#13;
reform. On the basis of policy and institutional progress in these projects, three FY96/97 projects would&#13;
assist in post-privatization restructuring in industry (Post-Privatization Restructuring Project - US$30&#13;
million), in agriculture (Agriculture Privatization Project - US$70 million), and in public sector&#13;
management (Treasury Modernization Project - US$15 million).&#13;
1.29       Although the economic performance under the 1994 IMF Standby Agreement was overall&#13;
successful, Kazakhstan failed to meet some of the end-1994 targets. As a result, the authorities requested&#13;
the IMF to replace the 1994 Standby Agreement with a new Standby arrangement. The IMF has agreed&#13;
in principle on a 1995 program and plans to finalize negotiations in April/May and present the 1995&#13;
Standby to its Board at the end of May 1995. Assuming that the country continues in a high case&#13;
scenario, further policy based operations would follow in the next two years, starting with a Financial&#13;
Sector Adjustment Loan in FY96 (US$150 million) aimed at assisting the restructuring of the banking&#13;
sector as well as deepening enterprise reforms. The rest of the operations would: halt the deterioration&#13;
in key oil producing facilities, restructure energy sector enterprises and help catalyze foreign investments&#13;
(Uzen Oil Field Rehabilitation Project); and prevent the deterioration of key infrastructure facilities&#13;
(through irrigation and infrastructure projects).&#13;
1.30       The assistance strategy for the social sectors focuses on helping the Government to: (i) assist&#13;
retrenched workers, especially through efficient payment of unemployment benefits; (ii) enable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 8                                                                            Chapter I&#13;
restructuring enterprises to divest commercially unnecessary social assets, while ensuring that essential&#13;
services (i.e. those generating large positive externalities) previously provided by enterprises are&#13;
maintained at an appropriate standard and affordable cost for those who need them; (iii) improve&#13;
informnation about living standards and the profile of poverty in the country, and target social benefits&#13;
more closely to those in need; and (iv) ensure that basic social services, especially for health, do not&#13;
collapse in the short-term and are reformed and restructured as appropriate in the medium-term. The first&#13;
two objectives would be addressed under the proposed project, while the third is already being supported&#13;
under the Bank-financed Technical Assistance Loan, effective in 1993. Measures to fulfil the fourth&#13;
objective would be initiated under this project.&#13;
1.31       The strategy for the project is consistent with Government objectives, as it would: (a) help&#13;
to develop unemployment assistance policies which will more effectively balance fiscal and social&#13;
protection objectives; (b) improve the capacity of the ES to deliver UB to increasing numbers of&#13;
unemployed people; (c) assist local governments in the selected oblasts/cities in assuming social assets&#13;
divested by enterprises, thus promoting restructuring and improving enterprise efficiency (and linking the&#13;
project to Bank support for privatization); (d) assist the local authorities to rationalize local social&#13;
spending; (e) finance relatively small investments in areas such as primary health care and pre-school&#13;
education; and (f) lay the ground for rationalizing social expenditures and improving public investment&#13;
management over the longer term, including development of a comprehensive national strategy of support&#13;
to local authorities to assume responsibility for divested social assets from enterprises (para 3.31).&#13;
D. Donor Coordination&#13;
1.32       The UN mission in Almaty has played an important role in donor coordination in the social&#13;
sectors. Together with the Bank, the UN organized in June 1994 a local CG meeting in Almaty.&#13;
Specialized UN agencies are implementing or planning programs of assistance for the health sector (WHO&#13;
and UNICEF), the Aral Sea region (WB, UNDP, UNEP), and labor market policy (ILO). The Asian&#13;
Development Bank (ADB), approved in December 1994 a US$20 million equivalent from their special&#13;
funds resources for the purchase of essential medical equipment and pharmaceuticals. OECD has&#13;
organized workshops on labor market policy and assisted with the production of labor market statistics.&#13;
Germany has and continues to provide some support on labor market policy and retraining of the&#13;
unemployed. USAID is financing policy support to the Governrment on health financing and other health&#13;
related issues. For the proposed project, USAID-financed resident consultants as well as consultants&#13;
financed by the Know How Fund (U.K.) provided technical assistance to the South Kazakhstan and&#13;
Pavlodar administrations for the preparation of detailed rationalization plans for the health and&#13;
kindergarten sectors. Through the Technical Assistance Project the Bank is providing technical and&#13;
financial support in pensions reform, health financing, poverty monitoring, and training of civil servants&#13;
and enterprise managers. The Bank has facilitated and will continue to promote, close coordination&#13;
among multilateral and bilateral donors, exploring co-financing arrangements under its own projects&#13;
where feasible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. LESSONS FROM RECENT EXPERIENCE&#13;
A. Employment Services&#13;
2.1        International experience suggests that Employment Services should combine programs of&#13;
passive measures (e.g. registration of the unemployed and payment of unemployment benefits) with&#13;
proactive measures (such as training and Temporary Employment Schemes (TES)). Proactive measures&#13;
generally cost more than cash benefits, but may decrease the duration of unemployment and increase&#13;
productivity. However, financing plans should ensure that proactive measures do not subsume budgetary&#13;
allocations for passive measures such as the payment of UB.&#13;
2.2         Bank experience in implementing Employment Service projects in other countries suggests&#13;
that the quality of staff is critical. Upgrading staff skills is a prerequisite for effective service delivery&#13;
and use of updated office technology. Automation is also essential to an efficient employment service,&#13;
provided that computer applications are based on well-designed programs and operational procedures.&#13;
Nevertheless, the difficulty of developing and implementing a comprehensive employment service&#13;
automation plan should not be underestimated, particularly in an environment characterized by rapidly&#13;
rising unemployment and limited local capacity.&#13;
2.3         Experience from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries and elsewhere in the FSU&#13;
suggests that women are more affected by unemployment than men during the early stages of&#13;
restructuring.  They are laid off more often, and their reemployment prospects are lower.4  As&#13;
restructuring progresses, lay-off rates converge for men and women, but re-employment prospects remain&#13;
lower for women. Youth unemployment in CEE countries has also been high, up to 3-4 times the general&#13;
unemployment rate. A further lesson of CEE experience is that policies for dealing with the long-term&#13;
unemployed should be an important part of the ES mandate.  Finally, our experience with the&#13;
implementation of the Russia Employment Service and Social Protection Project suggest that ownership&#13;
of the project from an early stage of design/preparation is key to the successful implementation of a&#13;
project.&#13;
B. Social Asset Divestiture&#13;
2.4        Although the Bank has not, to date, implemented a project dealing with social asset&#13;
divestiture, loans dealing with this matter are currently being developed for Russia and China. In&#13;
addition, under the on-going Russia Privatization Implementation Assistance Loan, US$20 million were&#13;
reallocated in August 1994, at the request of the Government to help finance a component in support of&#13;
the divestiture of kindergartens from privatized enterprises to municipal authorities. Evidence from&#13;
elsewhere in the FSU and in Kazakhstan itself, as well as from parts of Eastern and Central Europe,&#13;
suggests that enterprise social services need to be transferred to the state or to other providers in order&#13;
for enterprise restructuring and workers layoffs to take place. Orderly divestiture arrangements are&#13;
necessary to ensure continued access to basic social services for large sections of the population.&#13;

C. Municipal Development Projects&#13;
2.5         Lessons also emerge from a survey of World Bank experience in municipal development&#13;
projects elsewhere in the world (although, to date, no evaluations are available for the ECA region). Past&#13;
experience highlights how to deal with foreseeable risks: for example, the risks incurred with increasing&#13;
political decentralization and with changing political control of municipal and state authorities imply the&#13;
need to establish strong local administration that can survive political change. If the project meets the&#13;
priority needs of the locality, it is more likely to gain and sustain political support. In a multi-locality&#13;
project, the risks of delays are spread across a larger number of implementing agencies.&#13;
2.6         An important aspect of the increased management demands on local authorities is coping&#13;
with cost recovery for social services. In the health sector, a basic package of services should continue&#13;
to be provided free of charge, though the scope of the package will vary to some extent according to&#13;
fiscal constraints 5.&#13;
D. Institutional Development and Financial Management&#13;
2.7         A more general lesson is the need to ensure adequate counterpart funds, particularly in the&#13;
context of severe fiscal constraint. OED evaluations have concluded that the Bank should place greater&#13;
emphasis on project-related institutional development and financial management, particularly cost-&#13;
recovery, during preparation, appraisal and implementation.&#13;
2.8         Such objectives can also be supported by the early establishment, if possible, already at the&#13;
initial stage of project preparation, of a Project Preparation and Coordination Unit (PPCU) within the&#13;
responsible Ministry, with an adequate number of high level advisers. This performs two functions: (i)&#13;
it increases project ownership, and exploits local knowledge in project design; and (ii) it promotes&#13;
capacity building among officials involved in the PPCU. In addition to a PPCU, it has also proved&#13;
effective in other Bank-financed projects to appoint, at an early stage, Component Coordinators within&#13;
Government agencies responsible for the implementation of individual project components. Finally, where&#13;
project implementation is decentralized - as in this project - it is critical to involve both management and&#13;
technical staff of local administrations in the institutions and training set up under the project.&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
3.1        Kazakhstan is entering its third year as an independent nation. After bold reforms in the&#13;
first year, the government has had to contend with the complexities of implementing the transition to a&#13;
market economy while at the same time maintaining its existing system of social provision and protection.&#13;
The Government has made enterprise refonn and restructuring a key element of its economic reform&#13;
program. The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Kazakhstan, discussed&#13;
by the Board of Directors in August 1993. The CAS set forth a Bank assistance program based on an&#13;
intermediate-case scenario, characterized by implementation of a macro-economic program in the context&#13;
of an IMF STF, and satisfactory progress in key structural reform areas. Bank assistance was upgraded&#13;
to a high-case scenario when Kazakhstan adopted an IMF Standby arrangement in January 1994 and&#13;
moved to deepen structural reforms (para 1.29). The project addresses directly the Govermnent's concem&#13;
to strengthen its institutional capacity to carry out reforms in social sectors at the pace necessary to&#13;
support the economic transition (para 1.23). It also addresses an important element of the Government's&#13;
economic reform prograrn -- to adopt suitable and affordable social safety net measures to protect the&#13;
unemployed during this period of dramatic change. In line with Bank concerns about poverty reduction&#13;
and promoting the efficient use of resources, the project supports measures to strengthen the social safety&#13;
net to protect vulnerable groups, particularly retrenched workers and the long-term unemployed; develop&#13;
institutional capacity to improve the functioning of the labor market; speed up redeployment of skills to&#13;
support the emerging market economy; and support the process of divestiture of social assets from&#13;
enterprises to ensure the continuation of essential social services while promoting the economic&#13;
competitiveness of enterprises. The project will be an investment operation to complement the proposed&#13;
Structural Adjustment Loan and the privatization process.&#13;
B. Sectoral Reforms&#13;
3.2        A Memorandum of Understanding, dated March 25, 1995, addressed to the President of the&#13;
Bank contains policy statements relating to social assets divestiture and unemployment (Annex 1). Topics&#13;
included are: (a) Rationalization of Social Services: (i) definition of essential social services, (ii) general&#13;
service standards, (iii) delineation of responsibilities for provision of services, (iv) user charges, and (v)&#13;
consideration for local fiscal autonomy; and (b) Unemployment Benefit Policy: (i) Employment Fund,&#13;
(ii) unemployment benefits, and (iii) administration of the Employment Service.&#13;
C. Project Objectives&#13;
3.3        The project seeks to: (a) develop the capacity of the Employment Service in the Department&#13;
of Employment (DOE) of the Ministry of Labor (MOL) to manage the expected increase in the number&#13;
of registered unemployed and attendant benefit claims following the restructuring and privatization of&#13;
enterprises; and (b) ensure continued delivery of essential social services, by promoting orderly&#13;
divestiture of social assets from enterprises, and efficient management by municipalities of a unified&#13;
system of social services. The project will be implemented with a view to determining suitable models&#13;
for the design and implementation of a comprehensive national strategy for the divestiture of enterprise&#13;
social assets, thereby removing obstacles to restructuring and enhancing the competitiveness of&#13;
enterprises. The project would provide the institutional underpinning for the implementation of social&#13;
policies supported by the SAL.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 12                                                                          Chapter III&#13;
D. Project Description&#13;
3.4        To meet these objectives, the project has two main components: an Employment Service&#13;
Component to be implemented at both the national and regional levels; and a Social Services&#13;
Component, to be implemented in selected cities of South Kazakhstan and Paviodar oblasts.&#13;
3.5        The Employment Service Component will strengthen the institutional capacity of the ES&#13;
to register the unemployed and calculate and pay unemployment benefits; provide a more effective service&#13;
to unemployed jobseekers; and analyze labor markets and formulate labor market policies. It will also&#13;
develop a sharper focus for training and retraining of the unemployed, particularly women and youth,&#13;
through orienting the work of the ES towards promoting demand-driven training and through a greater&#13;
use of external training providers.&#13;
3.6         The Social Services Component will facilitate the transfer of essential social services from&#13;
restructuring enterprises to local governments, and rationalize management of all basic social services in&#13;
five selected cities -- South Kazakhstan Oblast: Shymkent City, Kentau, and Lenger; and Pavlodar&#13;
Oblast: Pavlodar City and Aksu. Local social service budget management will be reformed and social&#13;
assistance targeting improved. While many socially important facilities are run by the enterprises, the&#13;
project focuses only on essential services such as health care and early education, which are critical&#13;
elements of the social safety net.&#13;
E. Detailed Features&#13;
Employment Service Component (Annex 2)&#13;
3.7        With technical assistance under a Japanese Grant, the DOE commenced work on a number&#13;
of initiatives, including a review of its organizational structure at the republic level to provide stronger&#13;
management and direction to the ES. It has also initiated a revision of existing procedures in the ES for&#13;
dealing with the unemployed. The project will help accelerate this work and concentrate on specific&#13;
strategies for improving the overall operational effectiveness of the ES. Project financing under the ES&#13;
component will support: (a) institutional strengthening of the ES; (b) development and implementation&#13;
of a simplified unemployment benefits (UB) system and service delivery; (c) training and development&#13;
of staff; and (d) a pilot program in the two selected oblasts and Almaty to strengthen counselling and&#13;
retraining of the unemployed. Particular attention will be given to assisting women and young workers,&#13;
who are most affected by unemployment.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening (US$1.2 million of base costs)&#13;
3.8        Although this sub-component is relatively small, it is critically important for ensuring that&#13;
the ES has the capacity and the ability at both national and oblast levels to provide leadership and&#13;
effective management in handling the changes that are taking place in the economy, generally and in the&#13;
labor market in particular. The sub-component will concentrate on improving the skills and experience&#13;
of senior managers in policy development, operational planning and financial management. It will finance&#13;
23 months of technical assistance, computer equipment, supplies and training of staff. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that as a condition of Loan effectiveness, proposals for the provision of technical&#13;
assistance services will have been solicited, received and evaluated by the Borrower and furnished to the&#13;
Bank (para 7. 1(a)). The sub-component has three elements:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter III                                                                           Page 13&#13;
3.9        Management Improvement.  Managers require new skills to deal with labor market&#13;
problems that are likely to arise as the market economy is developed. Different types of skills are needed&#13;
for financial management and operational planning and for dealing with ES clients, both employers and&#13;
the unemployed. The extent of these changes and the differences and impact they may have on the&#13;
working habits of both managers and staff should not be underestimated. Not only are new skills to be&#13;
learned but old skills may have to be unlearned. A Management Specialist will be provided for three&#13;
months to run management workshops for all senior managers in the oblast offices and the DOE to&#13;
emphasize their role in introducing and achieving change. This technical assistance will be provided in&#13;
PYI, with the emphasis being not only on training key managers but on transferring skills to local ES&#13;
trainers so that management improvement is built into the staff training system of the ES. Assistance&#13;
would also enable the ES to improve its allocation of resources, especially the distribution of staff among&#13;
employment offices (EOs). A workshop program to be provided under the project will highlight&#13;
managers' responsibility for sound financial management and accountability for achieving their work plans&#13;
and operating within their allocated budgets. Five two-day workshops, each for 15-20 managers, will&#13;
be conducted during PYI; two workshops per year will be organized from PY2 to PY5. Assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations that by June 30, 1996, guidelines will be developed by the ES to modify&#13;
its overall staffing distribution in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, to enable more effective support of&#13;
local offices in areas of high unemployment (para 7.3 (g)).&#13;
3.10        Labor MarketAnalysis6. The system for gathering and monitoring labor market information&#13;
and statistics will be upgraded. This requires the development of computer systems and substantial&#13;
revision of statistical systems such as industry and occupation coding and data collection methods. Funds&#13;
will be provided to engage experts to work with local staff to develop their skills in collecting,&#13;
disseminating and analyzing labor market information. Skills should be developed to analyze employment&#13;
indicators, and prepare limited employment, industry, and occupation forecasts. A limited number of&#13;
computers will be provided for each oblast and for the DOE's national office. A Labor Market Specialist&#13;
will be engaged for four months over the first two years of the project. The project will also provide 12&#13;
fellowships of 3-4 weeks each in the first and second year to enable key staff to become familiar with&#13;
labor market research techniques in other countries, to investigate best practices, and to decide what&#13;
techniques and procedures would be best suited for adoption in Kazakhstan.&#13;
3.11        Policy Analysis. New policies and programs will be required as the labor market changes.&#13;
New management skills will ensure that the improved research and analytical capability leads to better&#13;
policy development. Technical assistance will be provided for four months in the first two years of the&#13;
project to assist the ES develop its policy unit and prepare any necessary laws or decrees. In addition,&#13;
12 months of a Labor Market Policy Specialist will provide advice to the Minister of Labor on overall&#13;
labor market and employment issues. The ES will keep up with overseas practices and developments&#13;
through study tours, internal seminars and information dissemination. A number of organizational issues&#13;
for the ES are expected to arise as new policies are developed; assistance will be provided to enable the&#13;
ES to cope with these issues.&#13;

Unemployment Benefits and Service Delivery (US$13.7 million of base costs)&#13;
3.12       This sub-component is designed to improve the daily operations of the ES. The operations&#13;
will be upgraded through the preparation of new guidelines and procedures for basic employment center&#13;
functions, including assessing the eligibility of applicants for unemployment benefits. EOs will be&#13;
upgraded and reequipped to cope with the growing number of unemployed. The project will finance 20&#13;
months of technical assistance, computer equipment, and the establishment of a Model Office (MO) in&#13;
each oblast. Each MO will be equipped with furniture and equipment; minor furniture and fittings will&#13;
also be provided to all EOs. Four related activities would help achieve these objectives:&#13;
3.13        Unemployment Benefits7.  Rising unemployment is already putting the unemployment&#13;
benefit system under strain. The procedures for assessing claims for UB will be simplified with&#13;
individual officers taking greater responsibility for making decisions. The system will be computerized&#13;
including automation of regular payments to beneficiaries. Procedures will be developed to deal with&#13;
clients in remote locations. Systems of monitoring payments and, in the longer term, fraud control will&#13;
be implemented. An Unemployment Benefit Expert will provide technical assistance for two months to&#13;
help the ES formulate and implement revised policy and procedures.&#13;
3.14        On the policy level, the UB system will focus on providing a simpler and more streamlined&#13;
process of short-term assistance for up to six months for unemployed people during their labor market&#13;
search.  Assurances were obtained at negotiations that as a condition of disbursement for the&#13;
Unemployment Benefits and Service Delivery sub-component, the Borrower will enact legislation&#13;
providing for satisfactory scale of and entitlement to UB, with the minimum level of such benefits being&#13;
equal to at least three times the base numerate established pursuant to the Borrower's Presidential Decree&#13;
No. 2120 dated March 15, 1995, or any other law establishing said minimum level (para 7.2 (a)). In&#13;
addition, assurances were obtained at negotiations that by June 30, 1996: (a) policies related to eligibility&#13;
of unemployed for benefits beyond the existing six month period will be adopted in a manner satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank (para 7.3 (h)); and (b) alternative support and training options will be defined for school&#13;
graduates and other new or returning entrants into the labor market (para 7.3 (i)).&#13;
3.15        Service Delivery. Service delivery should be improved as a matter of urgency, particularly&#13;
in areas expected to be affected by enterprise liquidations and restructuring. The daily operations of the&#13;
EOs will be restructured. New operating procedures will be developed to cover basic functions such as&#13;
registering unemployed people, accepting job vacancies from employers, matching unemployed people&#13;
to jobs, and providing a self-service system for the unemployed. Standard operating manuals will be&#13;
prepared with a far stronger client focus in the operations of the ES. Technical assistance will be&#13;
provided by an Employment Expert to work with DOE staff at the national level for 6 months over the&#13;
first two years of the project to streamline existing procedures for dealing with jobseekers and employers,&#13;
and to prepare standard operational manuals for EOs and quick reference guides for managers and&#13;
supervisors when training new staff. The assistance to be provided by the Employment Expert will&#13;
emphasize on-the-job training, and training courses. It will be in addition to the work undertaken in&#13;
support of UB reform and for implementation of the Model Office program. Assurances were obtained&#13;
at negotiations that by June 30, 1996, the procedures for applying for UB will be streamlined in a&#13;
manner satisfactory to the Bank and responsibility for approval for UB payments will be delegated by the&#13;
existing commissions to the staff of ES (7.3 (j)).&#13;

Chapter III                                                                         Page 15&#13;
3.16       Procedures will be developed for dealing with enterprises that are retrenching workers as&#13;
a result of industry restructuring. Particular emphasis will be placed on situations of mass layoffs,&#13;
streamlining the procedures for registering retrench workers and making greater use of TES, especially&#13;
in areas where unemployment is already high. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that by June&#13;
30, 1996, the current payment structure for participants in TES will be changed in accordance with the&#13;
revised structure of unemployment benefits and payments of TES will be above the minimum level of UB&#13;
(para 7.3 (k)).&#13;
3.17       The way that EOs are organized needs to be substantially changed, in terms of workloads&#13;
and work distribution among staff, and the physical structure of the offices. One MO will be established&#13;
in each oblast. MOs will incorporate all new operating procedures and guidelines, before their wider&#13;
introduction throughout the country. MOs will incorporate new organizational structures and the multi-&#13;
skilling (para 3.23) of staff to handle a wider range of tasks and to respond to different periods of&#13;
workload pressures. The physical structure of offices will be upgraded and the offices provided with&#13;
equipment and computers.&#13;
3.18       Technical assistance financed under the Japanese Grant is in place to help the DOE establish&#13;
two MOs. At least two other offices will be designated as MOs while the first two are being developed&#13;
as mentors. The system of using mentors will be extended gradually to other offices, with the full 20&#13;
MOs being established within 3 years; 10 MOs would be established in PYI and 8 in PY2. Timing and&#13;
location of additional MOs will follow closely the liquidation process of large distressed enterprises&#13;
agreed by the Government under the SAL. The project will finance 10 study tours, the refitting of offices&#13;
as well as furniture and equipment for the MOs. It will also include computer equipment and training&#13;
supplies for the training room in each MO. Upgrading of the remaining EOs will be financed in the last&#13;
three years of the project.&#13;
3.19       Computerization. While the ES has many computers (PCs), most of them are obsolete.&#13;
Virtually all of the computers are in the oblast centers, few are in raion centers and rural areas where&#13;
workload pressures are likely to become high. The work of the ES will be extensively computerized&#13;
through the project. Major areas of development will include the following systems: UB, ES operations,&#13;
labor market information, financial management, and the administration of the Employment Fund.&#13;
3.20       Technical assistance is in place with funding from the Japanese Grant, to develop a detailed&#13;
strategy for computerization. The strategy will encompass: data issues (data standards and coding&#13;
systems); technical issues (computer and telecommunications technologies and software, both proprietary&#13;
and in-house); and physical and environmental considerations (electricity supply and building constraints).&#13;
The schedule for procurement of computers will follow that for the introduction of MOs.&#13;
3.21       The project will finance a Systems Expert for six months (the first 3 months are being&#13;
financed under the Japanese Grant) to work with local specialists to evaluate this software and to develop&#13;
appropriate enhancements to automate UB calculations and payments as well as to accommodate changes&#13;
resulting from work on standardizing and streamlining operational and procedural guidelines. This work&#13;
will permit automated registration, benefits calculations and delivery and record keeping by EOs. In&#13;
addition, a technical expert will be provided for 4 months during the first two years of the project to&#13;
assess technical and communication links, introduce local area networks, and develop a national network.&#13;
3.22       Mass Layoffs. As enterprises divest themselves of social assets and undergo restructuring&#13;
and privatization, significant retrenchments are expected. Technical assistance to be provided by a Labor&#13;
Market Adjustment Expert for two months in PY1 will assist local ES staff develop strategies to cope&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 16                                                                            Chapter III&#13;
with these situations, with special emphasis on the large distressed enterprises to be closed under the&#13;
liquidation program agreed by the Government under the SAL. The strategy will include the development&#13;
of procedures to be followed in mass layoff situations, including expanding labor-intensive TES.&#13;
Technical assistance will give particular attention to on-the-job training. In addition, in PYI, fellowships&#13;
will be financed for 4-6 staff (3-4 weeks each) to visit selected countries with relevant experience in mass&#13;
layoff situations.&#13;
Staff Training and Development (US$0.4 million of base costs)&#13;
3.23       The large increase in numbers of unemployed needing assistance from EOs will place&#13;
additional demands on staff working in these offices. This sub-component aims at strengthening the&#13;
organizational capacity at the supervisory and operational levels to respond to the increasing demands.&#13;
It would allow staff, after appropriate training, to undertake a wider range of duties than they currently&#13;
perform. While much of the training will be procedural, e.g. in new rules for administering UB, it will&#13;
also include the introduction of new ways for staff to go about their work. For example, under the&#13;
vertical organizational structure that is typically used, each staff member has limited skills and job&#13;
requirements. This will not be effective in handling the greatly increased but irregular workloads that&#13;
already are arising. Staff must become multi-skilled, in particular with greater emphasis on computer&#13;
skills. The process of change must be carefully managed including appropriate training for staff.&#13;
3.24       Training experts will provide 10 months of technical assistance (including 3 months under&#13;
the Japanese Grant), to review the existing training policy, facilities, and capacity, and to determine the&#13;
basic competencies required in future by the ES staff.  A detailed strategy for staff training and&#13;
development will be initiated under Japanese Grant financing. A training needs assessment will be&#13;
conducted for staff in the first two MOs. In order to transfer new training skills and techniques to local&#13;
staff, the preparatory work will be undertaken in conjunction with local trainers. Training manuals will&#13;
be developed including handbooks that would facilitate some self-training. This is especially important&#13;
in light of the relatively high turnover of staff in the ES. The schedule for staff training development&#13;
throughout the ES will follow the same schedule as the introduction of MOs and computerization.&#13;
Training for DOE staff will be carried out in the first two years of the project. The project will also&#13;
finance the provision of equipment and training aids for use in the staff training rooms. The training&#13;
rooms will provide facilities for staff from other offices in each raion to receive training as well as to see&#13;
the revised procedures in operation in the MOs. The project will also finance the procurement of&#13;
furniture and equipment for a training room to be established within the DOE in Almaty. This room will&#13;
also be used to provide general management and development courses for staff in management and&#13;
supervisory positions on topics such as financial management and accountability, operational planning and&#13;
performance monitoring.&#13;
3.25       Fellowships and Study Tours. A study tour to Australia for 8 technical staff of the ES took&#13;
place in November 1994, under the Bank-financed Technical Assistance Project, to review procedures&#13;
and practices in the ES of Australia, including MOs. Fellowships and study tours will be financed for&#13;
staff to study in some depth the employment systems in other countries, particularly concentrating on&#13;
specialties such as labor market research, financial management, unemployment benefits systems and&#13;
computerization. A major effort will be made during the first two years for staff to undertake these&#13;
tours. Fellowships of up to two-months each for six staff are planned for the first and second years of&#13;
project implementation as well as study tours for 8 staff of two-three weeks each.&#13;

Chapter III                                                                         Page 17&#13;
Pilot Programs for Training and Retraining of the Unemployed (US$0.4 million of base costs)&#13;
3.26       Retraining. This sub-component is intended to assist the ES to develop a sharper focus for&#13;
training and retraining of the unemployed through orienting the work of training centers, under the MOL,&#13;
towards demand-driven training and a greater use of external training providers. The sub-component&#13;
would run as a pilot program in three oblast city centers -- Almaty, Paviodar and Shymkent. The&#13;
objective will be to: (a) develop the capacity of the regional training centers to coordinate activities with&#13;
city EOs, public and private training providers and the business community; (b) utilize the most recent&#13;
methods for assessing jobseekers' capabilities; and (c) develop informnation and advisory services to&#13;
jobseekers wishing to participate in training courses. An additional objective will be to stimulate the&#13;
development of business start-up courses for unemployed clients, specifically women, in collaboration&#13;
with non-government training providers.&#13;
3.27       Although the sub-component is small and to be implemented in only 3 oblasts, it is a critical&#13;
first step in shifting attitudes about the role of vocational training in Kazakhstan and in redirecting an&#13;
essentially supply-driven system towards one that is more responsive to market demand. While the task&#13;
of reforming the vocational training system as a whole is beyond the scope of this project, the sub-&#13;
component will generate important lessons for consideration on a national scale in the near future, and&#13;
for incorporation in the on-going work in the ES on service delivery for the unemployed. Working&#13;
groups and workshops at the oblast and republic level will be financed under this sub-component to&#13;
provide for more wide-ranging discussions on the relevance and cost-effectiveness of vocational training&#13;
for the evolving labor market in the country.&#13;
3.28       The sub-component will finance 12 months of technical assistance over two years to the&#13;
three oblasts training centers and to the Republic Center for Vocational Training in Almaty. Technical&#13;
assistance will cover four broad areas: (a) reviewing and revising client assessment and counseling&#13;
methods used by t.aining centers; (ii) training of staff in the three oblast centers and the republic center&#13;
in Almaty; (iii) overseeing the implementation of a training needs assessment in the three oblasts (in&#13;
management and self-employment, with specific focus on developing entrepreneurship among unemployed&#13;
women. To support these activities, the sub-component will finance 8 study tours, essential equipment&#13;
for training centers, including computer equipment and software specifically for developing data bases&#13;
and information on training courses; materials; and workshops for staff training; materials for a self-serve&#13;
information center in each training center and workshops to improve information exchange with EOs and&#13;
employers. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that by June 30, 1996, the ES will develop a&#13;
comprehensive strategy to contract training services to private and public institutions capable of delivering&#13;
job-oriented training courses in skill areas with good employment prospects (para 7.3 (1)).&#13;
3.29       To encourage a broader dialogue on and commitment to redirecting training for the&#13;
unemployed, Training Advisory Groups (TAGs) will be established in each of the participating oblasts.&#13;
The formation of the TAGs will be the responsibility of the oblast ES and will include representatives&#13;
from public and private sector training institutions, Ministry of Education, the ES and the local business&#13;
community. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that TAGs will be set up in each participating&#13;
oblast by June 30, 1996 (para 7.3 (m)). The purpose of the TAGs will be two-fold. First, to create a&#13;
working dialogue between local organizations concerned with the role of vocational training and the need&#13;
for more flexible and demand-driven training as the market economy develops.  Second, to take&#13;
responsibility for conducting a training needs assessment covering both formal and informal enterprises&#13;
and to develop recommendations for the direction of future training capacity in the oblast.&#13;
Recommnendations from each oblast will provide the raw material necessary for more informed discussions&#13;
on vocational training at the republic level.&#13;

Social Services Component (Annex 3)&#13;
3.30        The process of enterprise divestiture of social assets is putting the municipal governments&#13;
under significant management and financial pressure. To facilitate the transfers of social services out of&#13;
the enterprise sector, the Government's immediate priority is to provide additional financial support to&#13;
local administrations to meet the incremental cost requirements of the social services acquired or to be&#13;
acquired from enterprises. However, both the central and local budgets are increasingly unable to cover&#13;
such costs. The magnitude of the problems that have emerged and continue to emerge for both the State&#13;
and the enterprises, combined with the lack of an appropriate national policy framework or experience&#13;
to deal with them, have made it necessary to consider a pilot project in a limited number of oblasts and&#13;
cities. The pilot will be monitored closely (para 3.56 and Annex 3C). The results obtained and the&#13;
lessons learned would be used to implement a nation-wide policy (para 3.31) for an orderly transfer of&#13;
assets from the enterprises to local administrations or for their privatization. Consistent with the pilot&#13;
nature of the project, the Social Services Component will be implemented in five selected cities of South&#13;
Kazakhstan and Pavlodar Oblasts: Shymkent City, Kentau and Lenger for the first, and Pavlodar City and&#13;
Aksu for the second.&#13;
3.31        The component will provide support for management efficiency improvements, capital and&#13;
incremental recurrent costs, and technical assistance for kindergartens and medical facilities. The main&#13;
vehicle for the component will be the rationalization plans for the management of social services (para&#13;
3.35 and Annex 3B) and the corresponding annual work programs. On the basis of the plans and taking&#13;
into account other factors that might subsequently emerge, local administrations will be expected to&#13;
manage the transfer of assets and maintain these services at an acceptable level. Specific monitoring&#13;
arrangements will be put in place and regular reviews carried out (Annex 3C) to ensure that the plans&#13;
agreed upon with the cities are implemented on a timely manner. Continued funding will be subject to&#13;
satisfactory progress with the implementation of the rationalization plans. With technical assistance from&#13;
the PPF, the Government intends to complete an inventory of enterprise social assets in all oblasts by&#13;
September 1995. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Government by December 31, 1995&#13;
would design a comprehensive national strategy satisfactory to the Bank for the divestiture of social assets&#13;
of state-owned and state-controlled enterprises and develop as part of such strategy a set of principles&#13;
covering access to essential services (para 7.3 (e)).&#13;
3.32        Analyses of the health and pre-school sectors carried out during preparation, revealed the&#13;
following key problem areas. In the health sector, excess capacity (both facilities and personnel) and&#13;
resulting excess utilization; inefficient resource use; and shortages of supplies and equipment. In the pre-&#13;
school sector, and in commnon with all publicly funded services, municipal kindergartens face a growing&#13;
mismatch between requirements and revenues available. The severity of this situation varies within the&#13;
oblasts, from stringent but not acute cash problems, i.e. Shymkent, with growing arrears in salaries and&#13;
other areas, to effective collapse in Kentau, with most kindergartens at least temporarily closed.&#13;
Alongside arrears problems, expenditures on food have come under increasing pressure, with reductions&#13;
in both quantity and quality, as have expenditures on materials, supplies and maintenance.&#13;
3.33        The Social Services Component has two main sub-components: (i) Social Service Support,&#13;
and (ii) Institutional Support.&#13;
Social Services Support (US$28.5 million of base costs)&#13;
3.34        This sub-component will finance upgrading and rehabilitation of critical infrastructure of&#13;
social facilities in two areas: health (modest rehabilitation of hospitals and polyclinics, and purchase of&#13;
essential medical equipment, supplies, vaccines and drugs), and education (modest rehabilitation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter III                                                                                Page 19&#13;
kindergartens and provision of training materials and books). In addition, loan financing will support&#13;
incremental recurrent costs for divested facilities on a declining basis, complemented by local counterpart&#13;
contribution. The project will include rationalization of local social service budget management. To this&#13;
end, the project will aim at improving management of oblast and municipal public expenditures, so as&#13;
to rationalize social expenditures and improve targeting of social assistance.&#13;
3.35        The rationalization plans, prepared for each participating city, are a detailed program to&#13;
assist the Government in its efforts to: (i) ensure the efficient transfer of social assets to the&#13;
municipalities, and the restructuring and physical rehabilitation of enterprise social assets; (ii) invest in&#13;
equipment and supplies; (iii) secure the financing of incremental recurrent costs; (iv) introduce/expand&#13;
cost recovery measures; and (v) improve the management of social assets of each participating city.&#13;
These plans were prepared by staff of the administrations of the cities concerned, assisted by consultants&#13;
and Bank staff. Annex 3B8 includes the rationalization tables and presents: assumptions taken, detailed&#13;
city inventories and financing plans, summary of the proposed asset restructuring program, and cash flow&#13;
projections for each city.&#13;
3.36        To define in more detail the rationalization programs to be implemented during 1995,&#13;
detailed work was carried out with technical assistance financed by the Know How Fund and USAID to&#13;
help the city administrations prepare specific draft work programs for 1995 (Project Documents 5-8).&#13;
This work: (a) reviewed the efficiency of the health and kindergarten systems in the selected cities; (b)&#13;
assessed the impact of rationalization plans on utilization, capacity and access to services; (c) identified&#13;
potential facilities for closure under rationalization plans, with special emphasis on those to be closed&#13;
during 1995/96; (d) provided recommendations on basic standards and levels for service provision to&#13;
guide the rationalization process; and (e) identified specific cost reduction measures. Preliminary analysis&#13;
carried out during appraisal work had identified key policy and economic issues of relevance to the&#13;
project and areas of consistency and inconsistency between the project and local policy. Additional work&#13;
identified catchment population currently served by facilities to allow basic modeling of the impact of&#13;
closure on physical access to facilities. Data on capacity of facilities (actual as well as "official") has&#13;
been combined with that on utilization/activity. Additional data, e.g. bed occupancy, turnover, length&#13;
of stay, etc., has been collected from hospitals. Where available, facility specific data on costs (fixed&#13;
and variable) has also been collected. Analysis of this data provides an indication of system capacity and&#13;
relative performance of facilities. The information outlined above has been combined with projections&#13;
of demand to compare it with system capacity following rationalization.&#13;
3.37        Selection of facilities to be closed under the rationalization plans will be on the basis of poor&#13;
performance and the least adverse impact on access to facilities. Appropriate areas for rehabilitation&#13;
investment will be identified among those facilities that are to remain open. Analysis of available cost&#13;
information on relevant facilities has been undertaken to identify feasible areas of cost reduction and&#13;
productivity improvements. Areas in which investment in supplies, medicines and equipment might&#13;
enhance productivity and meet priority needs have also been identified. In the kindergarten and health&#13;
sectors, basic minimum provision standards to underpin the rationalization process is being identified.&#13;
These standards are being designed to safeguard access to services for vulnerable groups and to ensure&#13;
that services continue to function at acceptable levels. As a condition of Board presentation, the&#13;
Government finalized 1995 work programs reviewed during technical discussions at negotiations.&#13;
8/          Detailed cash flow analysis is presented in Project Document 4 .&#13;

The 1995 work programs contain: (a) introduction and objectives; (b) up-to-date inventory of social&#13;
assets in the city; (c) detailed description of social assets; (d) cost reduction measures proposed for the&#13;
year (proposed closures and divestitures and other measures to reduce costs); (e) total costs for the budget&#13;
year (rehabilitation, equipment, supplies, and incremental recurrent costs); (f) financial plan (World&#13;
Bank/local financing); (g) city cash flow; and (h) conclusions and recommendations. Future work plans&#13;
will also include a proposed training program, including criteria for selection of staff for study tours and&#13;
fellowships and domestic training. As a condition of Board presentation, the Government submitted&#13;
to the Bank for review draft subsidiary agreements for the purpose of carrying out the Social Service&#13;
Component under terms and conditions agreed with the Bank during negotiations. The Agreements&#13;
require the participating oblasts and cities to, inter alia: (a) assume responsibility for interest payments&#13;
on the loan (with the central Government responsible for repayment of the principal); (b) carry out the&#13;
respective annual work programs; (c) maintain adequate records and accounts and have them audited by&#13;
independent auditors; (d) procure goods, works and services in accordance with Bank guidelines and&#13;
permit the Borrower to inspect goods, works and services; (e) maintain separate budget line items for&#13;
expenditures related to work programs; (f) contribute in a timely manner from own resources, funds&#13;
required and specified in the work programs; (g) give the Borrower the right to suspend and terminate&#13;
use of Loan proceeds upon failure of participating oblasts and cities to perform their obligations under&#13;
the agreements; and (h) submit to the Borrower annual implementation reports. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that as a condition of Loan effectiveness, the Government will furnish to the&#13;
Bank duly signed subsidiary agreements (para 7.1 (b)).&#13;
3.38        Cost increases for budget social services as a result of divestiture will be offset by the end&#13;
of the project by: (i) rationalization/cost savings in the health and kindergarten systems; (ii) fee revenues&#13;
in the project cities, from the introduction of health care user charges and increases in kindergarten fees;&#13;
and (iii) removal/reduction of inefficiencies within the municipal kindergarten system, resulting in savings&#13;
without affecting the quality of service (e.g. more competitive procurement practices). After the project,&#13;
the Government will not be required to spend any more, in real terms, than it does currently on the&#13;
selected services in the project cities.&#13;
3.39        Assistance in the Transfer of Social Assets. The reform and restructuring of the enterprise&#13;
sector is forcing many enterprises either to close social facilities or to transfer them to local&#13;
administrations in an unplanned and disruptive manner, which puts their viability in jeopardy. The cities&#13;
participating in the project originally had 327 enterprise-owned social facilities (Annex 3A): 184&#13;
kindergartens, 90 dormitories, 25 summer camps, 13 sanatoria, 9 polyclinics, and 6 hospitals. Since the&#13;
beginning of preparation work for the project in May 1994, a good number of facilities have been closed&#13;
due to the financial difficulties the enterprises are experiencing.&#13;
3.40        The transfer of enterprise-owned kindergartens to the municipal sector will have a much&#13;
greater financial and managerial impact than the transfer of enterprise health facilities. In Shymkent city,&#13;
for example, enterprises operated 67 kindergartens in early 1994, as opposed to the municipality's 52.&#13;
Closure of enterprise kindergartens due to bankruptcy or other financial problems is accelerating in both&#13;
oblasts, with 25 of the 67 in Shymkent now closed. Anecdotal evidence indicates that several closed&#13;
kindergartens have been stripped of equipment and fittings by enterprise management, and some have&#13;
already been put to alternative uses.  Those that are standing idle clearly risk further physical&#13;
deterioration and increasing rehabilitation costs. The transfer of facilities and rationalization schedules&#13;
were, therefore, revised downwards during appraisal to reflect these closures and maximize the&#13;
affordability of asset transfer. As enterprise restructuring accelerates, many of these assets are being&#13;
transferred to the local administrations, which do not have the institutional and financial means to meet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter III                                                                                 Page 21&#13;
the incremental recurrent costs. A key aspect of the rationalization, therefore, is the establishment of the&#13;
financial and institutional conditions for the divestiture of these assets in an organized, and non-disruptive&#13;
way through updating the inventory of these assets and establishing a realistic transfer timetable.&#13;
3.41        Asset Restructuring. As of May 1994, the five participating cities had a total of 492 social&#13;
facilities, of which 165 owned by municipalities and 327 by enterprises. Some enterprise assets, mainly&#13;
kindergartens, have been closed recently. As a result of the continuing asset transfer, the municipalities&#13;
would have to manage nearly twice as many facilities as they currently operate. This would lead to a&#13;
serious management burden and a substantial increase in their budgetary requirements. The quality and&#13;
standards of the services delivered by these facilities and their levels of utilization vary from city to city&#13;
and from sector to sector. Some assets are under-utilized while the service level irk others is low. Some&#13;
facilities are in great need of repair or rehabilitation. In addition, operating costs vary considerably&#13;
between facilities even in the same sectors and same cities. Some services are also duplicated and their&#13;
availability far exceeds their potential or known demand in some localities.  Under the project, the&#13;
following number of facilities will be transferred: 89 kindergartens, 5 polyclinics and one hospital. The&#13;
number of facilities to be covered by the project, reflect the ability of the cities to manage the additional&#13;
facilities9. The project will provide technical assistance to the cities to help them determine, based on&#13;
clear criteria, which facilities should be closed, merged or amalgamnated.  In order to reduce&#13;
discrepancies, the project will also support efforts to define and set standards of operation and unit costs,&#13;
which would apply to the same sector within the same city.&#13;
3.42        Rehabilitation. Many social facilities, owned by enterprises and the municipalities have&#13;
buildings and other physical infrastructure in various states of disrepair due to a lack of regular&#13;
maintenance. This has resulted in unsafe working conditions and higher than normal maintenance and&#13;
repair costs (para 1.21). Estimates of rehabilitation requirements were established using criteria for&#13;
medium and minor works as defined by the preparation team with the help of a local civil engineer.&#13;
Medium rehabilitation needs are defined as low grade structural repairs (windows, roofs, doors, minor&#13;
plumbing, ventilation, and electrical works). Minor works include repair items such as replacement of&#13;
minor fittings, replacement of window glass, repainting, and floor coverings. The appraisal team&#13;
reviewed these estimates in the light of project objectives to rationalize local government expenditure and&#13;
restore social facilities to a minimum standard necessary for provision of services. Financial assistance&#13;
will be provided through the project to local governments for essential rehabilitation and upgrading of&#13;
kindergartens, hospitals, and polyclinics, which are not destined to be closed as a consequence of the&#13;
restructuring. The number of facilities to be rehabilitated and the allocations will be specified in the&#13;
annual work programs (para 3.38).&#13;
3.43        Capital Investments in Equipment and Supplies. The financial problems experienced by&#13;
the local administrations and the enterprises, combined with the breakdown of traditional supply lines&#13;
from the FSU, have resulted in a serious shortage of essential supplies in hospitals and polyclinics.&#13;
Kindergartens also suffer from inadequate supplies of training and other materials. To restore essential&#13;
services, the project will finance the procurement of essential goods such as medical supplies for hospitals&#13;
and polyclinics, and learning materials and medical supplies for kindergartens. Procurement of medical&#13;
supplies will be in accordance with WHO/UNICEF guidelines for essential drugs and equipment.&#13;
Medical supplies for health facilities will include essential medical equipment, drugs, medicines, and&#13;
vaccines; essential medical consumables such as bandages, rubber gloves, X-ray plates; and other&#13;
9/          Table 3b.3 of Annex 3B, gives a summary of the proposed asset restructuring program.&#13;

essential items. Learning materials will include books, art and music supplies. Support for major&#13;
repairs, rehabilitation, furniture, and equipment will be provided once, in order to bring facilities up to&#13;
a minimum standard. Funding will be available in the first two years of the project for this purpose.&#13;
Minor repairs, maintenance, essential medical supplies, and learning materials will be financed on an&#13;
annual basis.&#13;
3.44        Incremental Recurrent Costs. In the past, local administrations have relied on enterprises&#13;
to provide a substantial portion of the social services in addition to fiscal revenues. The painful enterprise&#13;
sector reform now taking place is having a double negative impact on the local administrations: it is&#13;
making the transfer of social assets inevitable while at the same time substantially reducing or sometimes&#13;
eliminating the fiscal revenues that could help the State meet its current budgetary needs, let alone face&#13;
new ones as a consequence of the divestitures (para 1.22).&#13;
3.45        As revenues decrease and expenditure requirements increase, the local administrations are&#13;
less able to operate appropriately. The project will provide financing for the incremental recurrent costs&#13;
of running the additional facilities divested from the enterprises. These costs will be financed on a&#13;
declining basis so as to gradually shift the burden to the cities. Recurrent costs include salaries, utilities,&#13;
meals, laundry and other consumables for divested facilities. Regular costs for investment purposes (for&#13;
example, learning materials, drugs, medicines, vaccines, and medical consumables) are included under&#13;
capital investment (para 3.43). The incremental costs were determined by calculating the difference&#13;
between recurrent costs for social services borne by local government at the time of appraisal and the&#13;
recurrent costs that will be borne after enterprise facilities are transferred to local government&#13;
management, and after all facilities have been initially rationalized, including standardization of operating&#13;
costs (para 3.46).&#13;
3.46        For the purposes of determining the level of funding for this sub-component, the incremental&#13;
cost were calculated on the basis of a two-year phasing of divestitures of social assets. Further reductions&#13;
in project support will result from cost reductions in later years as further rationalization is undertaken.&#13;
The loan will finance 90% of the incremental recurrent costs in PYI, 75% in PY2, 45% in PY3, and&#13;
25 % in PY4 and PY5. The balance will be provided by the government and beneficiaries. Assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations that as a condition of disbursement for incremental recurrent expenditures&#13;
for the Social Service Component, disbursements will be made only if the following actions have been&#13;
taken: (a) adoption of the annual work programs on the basis of rationalization plans, subject to prior&#13;
review and no objection by the Bank; (b) the central Government shall have established separate line&#13;
items for project expenditures in the national budget destined for the participating oblasts, the oblast&#13;
governments will do the same at the level of the oblasts' budgets for the participating cities, and the&#13;
participating cities shall include a similar line item in their own budgets; and (c) participating city&#13;
governments will cofinance incremental recurrent costs on an increasing basis relative to Bank financing&#13;
and deposit their counterpart funds into the respective project accounts according to financing plans in&#13;
the annual work programs (para 7.2 (b)).&#13;
3.47        Cost Recovery Measures. The difficult financial situation of both the enterprises and the&#13;
municipalities make it unlikely that the latter can meet the incremental recurrent cost financing&#13;
requirements of the project under present circumstances, even with the financing provided by the project.&#13;
The project, therefore, includes the gradual introduction of cost recovery measures for the services&#13;
delivered. The rationalization plans assume that user fees for kindergartens would increase from about&#13;
10% of total costs to about 18% by year 5 and for health, the increase would be from 2% to 10%. Fee&#13;
schedules are being reviewed and will be established with support from technical assistance. In devising&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter III                                                                         Page 23&#13;
the system of charges, provisions will be made to ensure continued access to health services and&#13;
kindergartens by poorer groups.&#13;
Institutional Support (US$2.6 million of base costs)&#13;
3.48       Institutional support will be provided by financial, health care and kindergartens management&#13;
specialists. Additional short-term technical assistance will be financed in areas such as: medical&#13;
equipment/supplies, pharmaceuticals, civil engineering, social impact monitoring, and social service&#13;
management training. Institutional support is being provided in two major phases: prior to Loan&#13;
effectiveness, under a PPF and with financing from the Know How Fund and USAID, and during the&#13;
project itself. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that as condition of Loan effectiveness,&#13;
proposals for the provision of technical assistance services will have been solicited, received, and&#13;
evaluated by the Borrower and furnished to the Bank (para 7.1 (a)). With financing under the PPF,&#13;
technical assistance is being provided for the following activities:&#13;
3.49       Financial Management Systems. Since social assets and the associated services are being&#13;
transferred from the outset of the project, it is important to establish simple, but effective financial&#13;
management systems as soon as possible. Work under the PPF will be carried out to develop&#13;
computerized management systems, both at the PCU and oblasts levels. This activity will cover an&#13;
assessment of user needs and the development of computer specifications. Technical assistance on&#13;
financial management will be provided for this purpose (3 months for each oblast).&#13;
3.50       Work Programs. While annual work programs will have to be developed, the first such&#13;
program (1995) would be the most difficult. Technical assistance was provided to assist the oblast and&#13;
city administrations to prepare the draft 1995 work programs and to ensure their applicability to the&#13;
rationalization plans. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that: (a) by September 15, 1995 and by&#13;
same date each subsequent year, the participating cities will prepare draft annual work programs for the&#13;
next year and shall submit such work programs to the respective oblasts; (b) by September 30, 1995 and&#13;
by same date each subsequent year, the participating cities and oblasts shall agree on the terms and&#13;
conditions of the work programs for the next year and shall submit such work programs to the PCU; (c)&#13;
by October 31, 1995 and by same date each subsequent year, the PCU shall consolidate the work&#13;
programs and submit them to the MOF and the Bank for review and comment; and (d) by November&#13;
30, 1995 and by same date each subsequent year, the Borrower, following its review of the annual work&#13;
programs and upon the Bank's review of and no objection to such work programs, and taking into&#13;
account the performance of the participating oblasts and cities under the preceding annual work program,&#13;
shall formally adopt them and ensure that the participating oblasts and cities formally adopt such work&#13;
programs (para 7.3 (a), (b), (c), an (d).&#13;
3.51       National Strategy. With technical assistance under the PPF, the Government intends to&#13;
complete an inventory of enterprise social assets and will design a comprehensive national strategy for&#13;
their divestiture throughout the country (paras 3.31 and 7.3 (a)). T'he strategy will aim at preserving&#13;
essential priority services to as large a population as possible, consistent with fiscal constraints. It will&#13;
be based on demographic characteristics, will specify appropriate service levels and standards, and will&#13;
include estimated operating costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 24                                                                              Chapter III&#13;
3.52        During the project phase, institutional support will be concerned with upgrading the&#13;
analytical capacity of local and regional governments to implement the project and to sustain the&#13;
administration of an enlarged social services sector. Support will fall under four categories.&#13;
3.53        Training. While training will take place throughout the project, early training is required&#13;
in three respects, change management, training local trainers, and selected internships.  Change&#13;
management training would assist managers to introduce and implement far reaching changes, many of&#13;
which may meet with resistance from various groups, including the wider community. Training local&#13;
trainers will enable them to take over the great bulk of staff training over the life of the project.&#13;
Internships for middle managers will be awarded for periods of 2 to 4 months to work in countries with&#13;
well-developed social services. Managers will be expected to play a vital role in implementing the project&#13;
and in administering social services. Assistance will include training of managers and staff in the&#13;
following areas: (a) financial management, (b) cost benefit analysis, (c) human resource development;&#13;
(d) management of social services; and (e) strategic and operational planning. Training will take place&#13;
at regional and local training locations and overseas. Initial training will be carried out by technical&#13;
assistance staff with local trainers eventually taking over all training. Training efforts will place special&#13;
emphasis on training staff to build the capacity to undertake rationalization of local social service budget&#13;
management. This type of training will be provided to financial staff both at the central and oblast/city&#13;
levels.&#13;
3.54        Studies and Internships. Study tours will be undertaken to selected countries to learn&#13;
management practices in social services. Internships for key operational staff for 2-4 months will be&#13;
awarded to visit countries with well-developed social services sectors. Selection of staff for study tours&#13;
and intermships will be made from oblast and city financial management, and key management staff within&#13;
kindergartens and medical facilities. Criteria for the selection of staff will be defined and agreed upon&#13;
with the Bank.&#13;
3.55        Development of Financial Management Systems.  Support will be given to develop&#13;
computerized systems covering budget management, financial management controls, and stock control.&#13;
Technical assistance will be provided to help develop and implement the systems.&#13;
3.56        Monitoring and Evaluation (para 5.14 and Annex 3C). Project implementation will take&#13;
place in an "experimental" setting with many unknown factors including the administrative capacity of&#13;
the cities. It is, therefore, essential to provide an effective moniitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) capacity&#13;
so that progress and effective utilization of resources can be monitored and evaluated. M&amp;E mechanisms&#13;
will be established early in the project with assistance from consultants. The relevance, performance,&#13;
effectiveness, efficiency and impact of project activities within its stated objectives will be periodically&#13;
evaluated using monitoring data. The main purpose of these evaluations will be to draw lessons from&#13;
the experience gained and to adjust project design and implementation accordingly. In addition to the&#13;
usual on-going evaluation that is normally carried out in development projects, the periodicity of other&#13;
evaluation will be tailored to the special circumstances of both the project and the country. The first&#13;
evaluation would take place six months after the start of effective project implementation; the second after&#13;
one year; the third would be the mid-term evaluation and the final one would be ex-post.&#13;

IV. COST ESTIMATES, FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
A. Project Costs&#13;
Summary of Project Costs&#13;
4.1         The total project cost is estimated at US$54.7. million, including contingencies amounting&#13;
to US$5.4 million or 11% of the total base cost of US$49.3 million. The project costs include technical&#13;
assistance, training, equipment, supplies, materials, modest rehabilitation and upgrading of facilities, and&#13;
incremental recurrent costs. The costs for different components are shown in Table 4.1 and are presented&#13;
in detail in Annex 8.&#13;

Price contingencies are based on standard inflation estimates (para 4.3). Physical contingencies have been&#13;
estimated at 10% for civil works, equipment, materials and supplies and 5% for training.&#13;
2f     Costs do not include duties and taxes as expenditures under the project would be tax exempt.&#13;
Basis of Cost Estimates&#13;
4.2         All project costs were estimated in US dollars because inflation rates in local currency are&#13;
difficult to forecast with any precision. Technical Assistance (TA) costs have been estimated on the basis&#13;
of recent costs estimates for comparable technical assistance in other Bank-financed projects in&#13;
Kazakhstan. Overseas fellowships have been estimated at US$10,000. The person-month costs of TA&#13;
include fees, recruitment/relocation costs, housing, subsistence, and overheads. Equipment and software&#13;
unit costs are based on recent contracts financed under the Kazakhstan Technical Assistance Project. Unit&#13;
costs for essential medical supplies and equipment are based on UNICEF price lists and quotations from&#13;
suppliers in Bank-financed projects in FSU countries. All project costs are based on April 1995 prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4.3        Project costs do not include any estimates for taxes and import duties since the Government&#13;
confirmed during negotiations that it will exempt goods and services financed by the project from such&#13;
taxes. Reimbursement for locally procured goods and services under the Loan would be made on the&#13;
basis of 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory costs) and 75% of local expenditures for items procured&#13;
locally.&#13;
Contingency Allowances&#13;
4.4        Price contingencies on foreign exchange costs are based on estimated inflation rates of 1.8 %&#13;
for 1996, 2.6% for 1997, 2.5% for 1998, 1999 and 2000. It is assumed that the rate of exchange will&#13;
depreciate in step with local inflation. Price contingencies on local costs (expressed in US dollars) are&#13;
therefore based on the same international inflation rates. Physical contingencies were estimated at 10%&#13;
for civil works, equipment, supplies and materials and 5 % for training.&#13;
Foreign Exchange Component&#13;
4.5          The foreign exchange component was estimated as follows: (a) medical and training&#13;
equipment, supplies and materials, computers and related equipment - 100%; (b) international consultants,&#13;
study tours and fellowships - 100%; (c) civil works and local training - 20%. These percentages have&#13;
been determined assuming that almost all equipment would be imported, and that all project financed&#13;
specialists would be foreign unless otherwise specified, e.g. interpreters. Including contingencies, the&#13;
resulting foreign exchange component is estimated at US $28.3 million, or 52% of total project costs.&#13;
Project Financing&#13;
4.6        The proposed loan of US$41.1 million will finance 75% of total project costs. The&#13;
Government will contribute US$8.7 million equivalent and beneficiaries US$4.9 million for a combined&#13;
local contribution of US$13.6 million equivalent or 25% of total project costs.&#13;

Recurrent Costs Implications of the Project&#13;
4.7        Incremental recurrent costs will include: salaries, utilities, meals, supplies, laundry, and&#13;
communication costs for the Social Service Component; office and training supplies, maintenance of&#13;
equipment, communication costs, and selective increases in staffing for the Employment Service&#13;
Component; and office supplies, maintenance of equipment, and conmmunication costs for the PCU.&#13;
Adequate staffing of implementing agencies will be achieved mainly by reallocating staff within the&#13;
Government, so that the net cost increase would be limited and largely offset by staff reductions implicit&#13;
in rationalizations agreed as part of the project. A key element of the Social Service Component is to&#13;
rationalize social expenditures in the selected cities. Sizeable reductions of social expenditures are,&#13;
therefore, expected as a result of the project.&#13;
B. Procurement&#13;
4.8         The Project Coordination Unit (PCU), will be responsible for overall project coordination,&#13;
including procurement (para 5.1 and Annex 6). Procurement for all categories of expenditures will be&#13;
made in accordance with relevant World Bank Guidelines and standard bidding documents and contracts,&#13;
as appropriate. Table 4.3 summarizes proposed procurement arrangements; detailed procurement&#13;
arrangements are in Annex 12.&#13;
4.9        Civil Works (US$4.0 million). Civil works for the Social Service Component of the project&#13;
consist of modest rehabilitation and upgrading of health facilities (US$1.6 million); kindergartens (US$1.8&#13;
million) in the five cities of the two oblasts, and employment offices for the Employment Service&#13;
Component (US$0.6 million). For the latter, work will involve the rehabilitation of approximately 20&#13;
employment offices in selected cities. Works, including repairs to existing facilities and installation of&#13;
equipment, estimated to cost U$50,000 equivalent or less per contract, and not to exceed US$4.0 million&#13;
in the aggregate, shall be procured under lumpsum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. The&#13;
invitation shall include a detailed description of the works, including basic specifications, the required&#13;
completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the Bank, and relevant drawings, where&#13;
applicable. the award shall be mae to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the&#13;
required work, and who has the experience and resources to successfully complete the contract.&#13;
4.10       Goods (US$23.1 million) consisting of equipment, supplies, drugs, and teaching and other&#13;
materials will be grouped to the extent practical to encourage competitive bidding. The following&#13;
methods of procurement will be followed:&#13;
(a)  International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures will be used for goods estimated to&#13;
cost US$18.5 million (80% of total goods) related to contracts estimated to cost more than&#13;
US$300,000 equivalent each;&#13;
(b) Limited International Bidding (LIB) procedures will be used for purchases, estimated to&#13;
cost US$300,000 equivalent or less per contract and US$2.8 million (12% of total goods)&#13;
equivalent or less in the aggregate, which the Bank agrees can only be purchased from a&#13;
limited number of suppliers, may be procured under contracts awarded in accordance with&#13;
the provisions of para 3.2 of the Procurement Guidelines. (i.e., suppliers of specific goods&#13;
would participate by invitation rather than in response to an advertisement);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 28                                                                            Chapter IV&#13;
(c) International Shopping (IS) procedures, in accordance with the provisions of paras 3.5 and&#13;
3.6 of the Guidelines, will be used for the procurement of goods that can not be grouped&#13;
in packages above US$300,000. Quotations from at least three suppliers from at least two&#13;
different eligible countries will be required for contracts less than US$300,000. An&#13;
aggregate limit of US$1.1 million (5% of total goods) will be procured through IS;&#13;
(d) National Shopping (NS) procedures for contracts up to US$50,000 each will be used for&#13;
locally available, off-the-shelf items of small value and standard specifications up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$0.7 million (3 % of total goods). In accordance with the provisions&#13;
of para 3.5 and 3.6 of the Guidelines, at least three price quotations obtained from qualified&#13;
suppliers will be required; and&#13;
(e)  Procurement from UN Agencies. Should it be determined that procurement of drugs and&#13;
other related medical supplies in the health sector could be carried out in a more efficient&#13;
and effective way from UNICEF or other UN Agencies, then such procedure could be used,&#13;
subject to prior review by the Bank, and in accordance with the provisions of para 3.9 of&#13;
the Guidelines.&#13;
4.11        Consulting Services (US$4.9 million). The project will finance about 10 consultant months&#13;
of individual consultants (US$0.2 million) and 2 consulting firms (about 17 consultant years - US$4.7&#13;
million). Specialists and/or consulting firms financed under the project will be hired in accordance with&#13;
the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency" dated August, 1981. For complex, time-based assignments, such contracts shall be&#13;
based on the standard form  of contract for consultants' services issued by the Bank, with such&#13;
modifications thereto as shall have been agreed by the Bank. Where no relevant standard contract&#13;
documents have been issued by the Bank, other standard forms acceptable to the Bank shall be used. The&#13;
Ministry of Labor has sent letters of invitation to consulting firms to present proposals for the provision&#13;
of technical assistance for the Employment Service. Similarly, letters of invitation have been sent by the&#13;
Ministry of Finance for the provision of technical assistance for the PCU and the Social Service&#13;
Component. The TORs for the latter services were designed in three phases: (i) establishment of the&#13;
PCU and preparation and execution of initial procurement actions for the major technical assistance&#13;
contracts to the MOL and for the Administrations of South Kazakhstan and Pavlodar Oblasts (to be&#13;
financed under a PPF); (ii) continued procurement of necessary consultants and equipment, and setting&#13;
up arrangements for rehabilitation of selected facilities; and (iii) supervision of on-going work and&#13;
provision of general support for policy and implementation until the project's conclusion. Consultants&#13;
selected in Phase I would be expected, if performance warrants, to provide services in Phases II and 111.&#13;
This approach will allow early implementation and encourage participation by recognized firms in this&#13;
field.&#13;
4.12        Training (US$1.2 million).  For overseas training and study tours financed under the&#13;
project, the qualifications of candidates along with their course of study, proposed training institutions&#13;
and costs, and in-country local training courses will be subject to prior review by the Bank. Staff will&#13;
be selected on the basis of established criteria, to be agreed upon with the Bank as part of the work&#13;
programns (para 3.54).&#13;
4.13          Incremental Recurrent Costs (US$21.0 million). The Loan will support incremental&#13;
recurrent costs on a declining basis, the balance will be provided by local governments and beneficiaries&#13;
&#13;

in the case of the Social Service Component, by the Ministry of Labor in the case of the Employment&#13;
Service Component, and by the Ministry of Finance in the case of the PCU. Recurrent costs for the&#13;
Employment Service Component will include office and training supplies, maintenance of office&#13;
equipment, communication charges (fax, international telephone calls). Recurrent costs for the Social&#13;
Services Component will include salaries, utilities, meals, laundry, other consumables, and&#13;
communication charges for divested facilities. Recurrent costs for the PCU will include office supplies,&#13;
maintenance of equipment, and communications charges. Procurement per institution under the Social&#13;
Service Component will be for low value contracts and affected either weekly or monthly (for example&#13;
food is procured weekly). In lieu of requiring each institution to present cancelled receipts for each&#13;
purchase, an agreement to disburse on a unit cost (i.e. number of children in kindergartens) will be&#13;
agreed upon with the Bank. The Bank will agree to disburse funds for these expenditures on the basis&#13;
of agreed annual budgets established in annual work programs, which will require prior Bank review.&#13;
Present practices for procuring such items include local shopping and sole-source procurement based on&#13;
the nature of the items. The Bank has found these procedures satisfactory. The cost calculations for the&#13;
Social Service Component were established on a unit cost basis (see Annex 3B); These unit costs form&#13;
the basis for city budgets. This would allow the Bank and the cities to establish, each year, uniform unit&#13;
costs which are the result of the rationalization plans of each city (i.e. number of children per&#13;
kindergarten, number of hospital beds and patient visits in polyclinics, and number of staff, etc.), which&#13;
then results in budget figures per institution. Periodic review and audit will be based on a verification&#13;
that the units agreed upon were actual, i.e. enrollments, patient days, etc.&#13;
4.14       Custom Duties and Tares. All Goods specifically imported for the project will be exempt&#13;
from custom duties and taxes.  Foreign technical assistance specialists will be exempt from the&#13;
Government's normal personal income tax. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations.&#13;
4.15       Preference for Domestic Manufacturers. For contracts for Goods to be awarded on the&#13;
basis of ICB, the Borrower may, with the agreement of the Bank, grant a margin of preference of up to&#13;
15% in accordance with World Bank Procurement Guidelines (January 1995).&#13;
Bank Procurement Oversight&#13;
4.16       Procurement Planning. Prior to the issuance of any invitations for bidding, a proposed&#13;
procurement plan for the project shall be furnished to the Bank for its review and approval, in accordance&#13;
with the provisions of para 1 of Appendix 1 of the Procurement Guidelines of January 1995.&#13;
Procurement of all goods and works shall be undertaken in accordance with such procurement plan as&#13;
shall have been approved by the Bank, and with the provisions of said para 1.&#13;
4.17       Bank Review: All ICB and LIB contracts including bidding documents, and the first two&#13;
national shopping contracts for works in each sector, including the standardized bidding documents will&#13;
be pre-reviewed by the Bank. Specifically, the following procurement actions would be subject to prior&#13;
Bank review:&#13;
(a) Civil Works: Works would be of a small nature, and rehabilitation rather than new&#13;
construction. Works will be procured under lurnpsum, fixed price contracts awarded on the&#13;
basis of quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a&#13;

written invitation. The award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price&#13;
quotation for the required work, and who has the experience and resources to successfully&#13;
complete the contract (para 4.9). The PCU will be responsible for the evaluation and&#13;
recommendation of award of contracts. The Bank will review prior to award the first two&#13;
rehabilitation contracts under each component (or more as the Bank may decide) and&#13;
monitor other awards and works on a selective basis during project supervision.&#13;
(b)  Goods: In general, pre-identified master lists of goods, indicating grouping, along with&#13;
estimates of cost and proposed method of procurement will be pre-reviewed by the Bank.&#13;
Items would be grouped to the extent practical to encourage competitive bidding and to&#13;
permit bulk procurement. All contracts above US$300,000 will require prior Bank pre-&#13;
review. Contracts below these limits will be subject to ex-post reviews during supervision&#13;
missions.&#13;
(c)  Consultants: The selection of consultant firms and individuals will be in accordance with&#13;
the World Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants (August, 1981). Terns of Reference for&#13;
all consulting assignments will be subject to prior Bank review. Terms and conditions of&#13;
contracts for all technical assistance assignments, invitation packages and evaluation reports&#13;
of assignments costing more than US$100,000 each for firms, and US$50,000 each for&#13;
individual consultants will be subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;
(d)  Procurement Progress Reports.  As part of the quarterly progress reports, specific&#13;
attention will be given to procurement activities.&#13;
4.18       General Review: The Bank will monitor procurement activities, contract management, and&#13;
project record-keeping during supervision missions. The Bank will undertake a focussed project launch&#13;
workshop and a comprehensive mid-term review of project progress; both activities will place special&#13;
emphasis on implementation including procurement matters (paras 5.4 and 5.13 and Annex 3C).&#13;
4.19       Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR): A CPAR has not been prepared.&#13;
Since the breakup of the FSU, all rules and regulations concerning procurement have become basically&#13;
invalid. For this project, the Government will follow the World Bank's Procurement Guidelines as&#13;
described above and as set forth in the Loan Agreement.&#13;
C. Disbursements&#13;
4.20       It is envisaged that the proposed Loan would be disbursed over a period of about six years.&#13;
No standard disbursement profile exists for Kazakhstan or for this type of project; the disbursement&#13;
forecast is based on the ECA disbursement profile adjusted for retroactive financing expenditures. Annex&#13;
11 shows a detailed disbursement forecast of the Loan. Funds disbursed under the PPF would be repaid&#13;
from the proposed Loan funds after effectiveness. The Project is expected to be completed by&#13;
December 31, 2001; the Loan closing date would be June 30, 2002. The proceeds of the loan would&#13;
be disbursed as per Table 4.5.&#13;

4.21       For expenditures relating to (i) incremental recurrent costs, (ii) contracts for goods valued&#13;
at less than US$300,000 equivalent, and (iii) contracts for works each valued at less than US$100,000&#13;
equivalent, reimbursements would be made on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). The&#13;
documentation to support these expenditures will be retained by the PCU, the MOL and the South&#13;
Kazakhstan and Pavlodar Administrations for their respective project activities for at least one year, after&#13;
receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement is made. This&#13;
documentation will be made available for review by the auditors and Bank supervision missions.&#13;
Disbursements for all other items will be made against full documentation and respect procurement&#13;
guidelines where applicable. Supervision missions will review documentation retained by the borrower&#13;
in the field. If ineligible expenditures, included those not justified by the evidence furnished, or amounts&#13;
in excess of agreed disbursement percentages are financed from the SA, the Bank will have the right to&#13;
withhold further deposits into the Special Account (SA). The Bank may exercise this right until the&#13;
borrower has: (a) refunded the amounts involved, or (b) (if the Bank agrees) submitted evidence of other&#13;
eligible expenditures that the Bank can use to offset the ineligible amounts. The minimrum amount of&#13;
each withdrawal application for direct payment would be US$50,000.&#13;
4.22       The District Office will submit SOEs to the city budget office. The statements will be&#13;
certified by the Chief of the District Office and the head of the school/health departments. The city&#13;
budget office will consolidate the SOEs from the districts and have them certified by the head of the city&#13;
administration before they are forwarded to the oblast where they will equally be certified by the head&#13;
of the oblast and transmitted to the PCU. The PCU will provide the official certification for the Bank&#13;
when requesting the replenishment of the SA.&#13;
4.23       In order to maintain the momentum achieved during project preparation and to ensure early&#13;
project start-up, the Loan provides for retroactive rmancing up to 10% of the Loan amount in respect&#13;
of expenditures incurred since January 1995. Expenditures will relate to works for both refitting of&#13;
employment offices and facilities to be supported under the Social Service Component, as well as&#13;
incremental recurrent costs for the Social Service Component. With technical assistance under the&#13;
Japanese Grant appropriate systems have been designed at the city level to ensure proper control and&#13;
utilization of SOE mechanisms.&#13;
Special Account&#13;
4.24       To facilitate and expedite disbursements, a Special Account (SA) in dollars has been&#13;
established by the Borrower in the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) on terms and conditions&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. A first deposit of US$20,000 has been made with PPF Financing. After the loan&#13;
becomes effective an additional deposit for a total combined amount of US$1.0 million will be made,&#13;
representing estimated average expenditures to be paid from the SA over a three-month period. To&#13;
facilitate payments at the city level, funds will be transferred in Tenge directly from the SA to bank&#13;
accounts in branches of the NBK at the oblast and city level under the ninety-day advance procedure.&#13;
All foreign expenditure payments will be made directly from the SA.&#13;
4.25       The Special Account has been established in the name of the Borrower and will be&#13;
administered by authorized staff of the PCU. Applications for replenishment of the SA will be submitted&#13;
to the Bank by the PCU monthly or whenever the account is drawn down by about 50% of the initial&#13;
deposit, whichever comes first.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 34                                                                            Chapter IV&#13;
4.26        As noted in para 4.24, the SA will be maintained in the NBK. The appraisal mission&#13;
confirmed that NBK is capable of meeting the requirements of the Bank with respect to opening and&#13;
maintaining the SA. NBK is: (i) financially sound as demonstrated by its latest accounts, as audited by&#13;
an internationally recognized auditing firm; (ii) has a significant foreign correspondence network covering&#13;
all major currencies; (iii) has a reasonable capacity and experience for issuing letters of credit, for making&#13;
direct foreign payments and other international transactions with appropriate arrangements for the training&#13;
and development of its staff; (iv) capable of performing a wide range of local banking services, including&#13;
cash payments, transfers to other domestic banks, issuance of debit notes, application of conversion rates&#13;
from foreign currencies, and maintenance of adequate accounts for the SA; (v) a member of Swift and&#13;
uses or plans to use this facility to expedite payment transfers; (vi) willing to issue a comfort Letter to&#13;
assure that amounts deposited in the SA would not be set off or otherwise seized or attached to satisfy&#13;
amounts due to the bank by the borrower; (vii) willing to maintain adequate accounts as required by the&#13;
Bank, provide to the Bank monthly bank statements, and any other information considered necessary&#13;
(copies of all transactions would be routinely submitted to the implementing agencies); and (viii) willing&#13;
to charge reasonable rates for its services and provide reasonable interest on balances held from time to&#13;
time.&#13;
D. Project Accounts, Budgets and Audits&#13;
Project Accounts and Budgets&#13;
4.27        Financing of project activities will proceed through Project Accounts (PAs) to be opened&#13;
in local branches of the NBK in each participating city, through which project funds will be channeled.&#13;
Transfers to the PAs will be made from the SA through the ninety-day advance accounts to be opened&#13;
at the oblast level upon presentation of three month expenditure requirements previously agreed in annual&#13;
work programs.&#13;
4.28        The current system for transferring funds from the central budget to the regions operates&#13;
as follows: at the beginning of the fiscal year for which the budget has been approved, and on the basis&#13;
of the agreed tax sharing rate, the Government provides written instructions to the oblast branches of the&#13;
NBK to transfer automatically to the oblasts their respective tax shares from the tax receipts from the&#13;
local enterprises. The difference between the tax payments by the enterprises, and the predesignated&#13;
shares of the oblasts is transferred to the republican treasury. At the next level down, each oblast sets&#13;
the tax sharing rate for the cities and transfers funds to them as they are received.&#13;
4.29        Financing by the Government and oblasts of project activities will be preceded by approval&#13;
of the annual work programs. The corresponding budgetary requirements will be submitted to the MOF&#13;
by the PCU, the ES and the oblasts, under separate line items clearly identifying the project. The&#13;
amounts then transferred by the Government to the MOL and the oblasts will include both the oblasts'&#13;
normal expenditures and their counterpart shares of project expenditures to be financed by the&#13;
Government.&#13;
Accounts and Audits&#13;
4.30        The Borrower will be responsible for the appropriate accounting of the funds provided by&#13;
the Bank under the Loan, for reporting on the use of these funds, and for ensuring that audits of the&#13;
financial statements or reports are submitted to the Bank. A computerized accounting system will be&#13;
established in the PCU. The Project Accountant in the PCU (para 5.1) will maintain consolidated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter IV                                                                       Page 35&#13;
accounts for the project and will prepare quarterly financial reports. The accounts will be maintained for&#13;
all project funds, i.e. loan funds and local contribution.&#13;
4.31       MOL and the local administrations of the two oblasts and five participating cities (each on&#13;
behalf of the Borrower) will establish an appropriate accounting system to process and record information&#13;
on the proper receipt and use of funds, both loan funds and local funds. The system should ensure timely&#13;
and accurate accounting of all transactions under the Loan and clear presentation of the financial&#13;
information. Short-term technical assistance will be provided to support the local administrations to&#13;
ensure that all project accounts are maintained in accordance with internationally accepted accounting&#13;
practices. The SA and project accounts are intended to assist the Borrower with cash flow and to enable&#13;
early and more effective project implementation and disbursements. The Borrower will ensure that all&#13;
the necessary arrangements for proper accounting of receipts and payments, including replenishment, are&#13;
completed before these accounts start operating.&#13;
4.32       All project records and accounts, including those for the SOEs, the SA, the ninety day&#13;
advance accounts, and PAs will be audited annually in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines for&#13;
Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (March 1982). An&#13;
international auditing firm would be appointed to perform project audits. The Bank will be provided&#13;
within six months of the end of each fiscal year with an audit report of such scope and detail as the Bank&#13;
may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements against certified&#13;
statement of expenditures.&#13;

V. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Overall Project Management and Implementation&#13;
Project Coordination Unit (PCU)&#13;
5.1        Implementation of specific components will be the responsibility of the respective&#13;
implementing agency (MOL for the ES component and the local authorities in South Kazakhstan and&#13;
Pavlodar Oblasts for the Social Services Component). Overall responsibility for project coordination will&#13;
rest with the PCU (Annex 6) established in the Ministry of Finance (MOF). In addition to overall&#13;
coordination, the PCU will be responsible for common implementation functions such as project&#13;
accounting, procurement, disbursements, consolidation of annual work programs and budgets, and&#13;
progress and annual reports. It will also provide training and technical assistance coordination, project&#13;
supervision, and assistance to the CCs. The PCU will report to the Minister of Finance. It will be&#13;
staffed with a director (already appointed), an accountant (local), a disbursement specialist (local), two&#13;
bilingual secretaries, a translator, a procurement expert (foreign), a technical assistance coordinator&#13;
(foreign), and a computer systems specialist (possibly a United Nations Volunteer). In addition, the&#13;
project will finance a limited number of short-term consultants as needed for specialized procurement,&#13;
i.e. pharmaceutical and medical equipment, and a civil engineer to supervise rehabilitation of facilities.&#13;
5.2        The Technical Assistance Administrator will provide overall institutional support to the&#13;
PCU. His/her TOR would emphasize capacity building, as well as coordination of long-term and&#13;
short-term TA, consolidation of quarterly and annual progress reports, work programs, budgets, and&#13;
project accounts. It is envisaged that capacity building promoted by the project, through the PCU, will&#13;
facilitate the integration of responsibilities to the MOF structure for supervision of financial management&#13;
of services in the oblasts. Contracting of two consulting firms, one each for the Employment Service&#13;
Component and PCU/Social Service Component to provide all foreign TA services, have been initiated&#13;
(para 4.11). Assurances were obtained at negotiations that as a condition of Loan effectiveness,&#13;
proposals for the provision of technical assistance services will have been solicited, received, and&#13;
evaluated by the Borrower and furnished to the Bank (para 7.1 (a)). Assurances were also obtained at&#13;
negotiations that the PCU will be maintained throughout the project implementation period in a manner&#13;
and with staffing, funds, facilities and other resources satisfactory to the Bank (para 7.3 (p)).&#13;
Project Coordinating Council (PCC)&#13;
5.3        The PCU will be supported by the PCC, whose main task will be to oversee project&#13;
implementation. The inter-ministerial Working Group established to provide policy guidance for the&#13;
preparation of the project will become the PCC. The PCC will be chaired by a Senior Management&#13;
Official of the MOF. As the Working Group, the PCC will be integrated by high-level representation&#13;
from the Apparatus of the Government, the Ministries of Finance, Economy, Labor, Social Protection,&#13;
Health, Education, and Justice, oblast and city authorities, the State Conmmittee on Management of State&#13;
Property, and the State Committee on Privatization. The PCC would meet once every three months or&#13;
more frequently when necessary. CCs will be invited to participate in these meetings and the PCU will&#13;
serve as the Secretariat.  The PCC will review and help resolve all issues raised by project&#13;
implementation that cannot be resolved by the implementing agencies or the PCU. Assurances were also&#13;
obtained at negotiations that the PCU will be maintained throughout the project implementation period&#13;
in a manner and with staffing, funds, facilities and other resources satisfactory to the Bank (para 7.3 (p)).&#13;
&#13;

B. Implementation of Components&#13;
5.4        The respective agencies will be responsible for implementation of their components. The&#13;
Ministry of Labor will implement the ES component, while the administrations of the oblasts will&#13;
implement the Social Services Component. In each implementing agency and at each significant level&#13;
of activity, Component Coordinators (CCs) have been nominated: one in the MOL and two in each&#13;
oblast and city administration (TOR for CCs are in Annex 4A). The CCs will be the focal points for all&#13;
project activities related to their components. The CC for the ES component will report directly to the&#13;
Head of the Department of Employment, and through him, to the Minister. The CC will be the first&#13;
point of contact between the Ministry, the PCU, the Bank, and the PCC. The CCs for each of the five&#13;
cities and the two oblasts will report directly to the head of the oblast and city administrations,&#13;
respectively. These arrangements will remove the need to create a separate structure within each&#13;
implementing agency. A seminar was held in November 1994 during the appraisal mission, with the&#13;
participation of all CCs and key officials of the Ministries of Finance, Economy and Labor for better&#13;
understanding of the project, proposed implementation arrangements, and Bank's procedures and&#13;
practices. A project launch workshop will be organized immediately after Board Presentation.&#13;
Employment Service&#13;
5.5        The responsibility for the implementation of the Employment Service Component will rest&#13;
with the Chairman of the ES in the DOE of the MOL. Institutional arrangements for implementation of&#13;
the ES component will be made at each level of the Labor portfolio as follows:&#13;
5.6        National Level. A single CC has been nominated to be responsible for the component.&#13;
The CC will report directly to the Chairman of the ES and through him, to the Minister. The CC will&#13;
be the first point of contact among the Ministry, the Bank, the PCU and the PCC. The CC will represent&#13;
the Ministry on the PCC. The CC will keep other areas of MOL informed of progress on the project.&#13;
The Chairman of ES will direct his senior officers as a Steering Group for the project. CC for individual&#13;
oblasts will be included on this Steering Group as the oblasts become more involved in project&#13;
implementation. A unit has been established in DOE to be responsible for project implementation and&#13;
to work closely with technical assistance to be financed under the project. The unit will report to the CC&#13;
and work closely with the PCU, especially with the specialist officers, the accountant, disbursement and&#13;
procurement specialists.&#13;
5.7        Oblast Level. As each oblast becomes more involved in project implementation (MOs will&#13;
be established during the first two years), it will nominate a CC to coordinate the oblast's participation&#13;
in the project. The CC will work with the national unit (para 5.6) to implement the MO in the oblast.&#13;
The CC will become a member of the overall Steering Group.&#13;
5.8        Employment Center Level. Each MO will have a manager nominated well in advance of&#13;
commencement of preparation work; managers have been nominated for the two MOs being established&#13;
at present (Pavlodar and Almaty). At least two other sites will be designated before completion of the&#13;
technical assistance being provided under the Japanese Grant. Shymkent has been selected as the second&#13;
site. To ensure they are familiar with the operations of MOs, staff from Shymkent EOs will become&#13;
involved with the MO in Almaty during the second and third quarters of 1995.  To facilitate&#13;
implementation and supervision, the second site will be selected from an oblast near Pavlodar. A rolling&#13;
system will be introduced where designated offices work closely with offices that have already been set&#13;
ip as MOs using them as mentors for their own development. A typical cycle for the introduction of a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter V                                                                           Page 38&#13;
MO will take seven months: design and plan (2 months), works (3 months), procure equipment and&#13;
materials (concurrent with site works), staff training (2 months).&#13;
Social Services Component&#13;
5.9        As in the ES component, the focal point for implementation of this component will be the&#13;
city CCs. They will be responsible for the preparation of the annual work programs and budgets (para&#13;
5. 10). The CCs will also help ensure that project accounts are maintained and that quarterly and annual&#13;
progress reports are prepared. At the oblast level, the CCs will be responsible for coordinating the&#13;
planning and implementation of project activities at the city level, consolidating the arniual work programs&#13;
and budgets and ensuring that the project financing requirements are incorporated in the oblast budgets&#13;
before they are sent to the PCU and subsequently to the MOF during the annual budget preparation&#13;
process. They will also review and consolidate the progress and annual reports before they are sent to&#13;
the PCU.&#13;
Project Reporting and Evaluation&#13;
5.10       The project will be implemented with reliance on detailed annual work programs (WP). The&#13;
first draft work programs covering the period January - December 1995 were reviewed at technical&#13;
discussions during negotiations (para 7.3 (c)). Subsequent WPs will be prepared and submitted to the&#13;
Bank by October 31 of each year (para 7.5(a)) to coincide with the normal Government budget cycle.&#13;
The city CCs will be responsible for the preparation of the WP for the social asset programs of the city.&#13;
The WP will be submitted to the city council as part of the city budget for approval. In the budget&#13;
proposals, project activities will be clearly identified and set aside for easy follow-up. The WP will be&#13;
forwarded to the oblast administration through the oblast CCs who will consolidate all the WPs from the&#13;
cities reporting to that particular oblast. The oblast council will then approve the consolidated WP and&#13;
forward them to the PCU.&#13;
5.11       The PCU will review and consolidate the WPs received from the oblasts. It will be&#13;
responsible for submitting the consolidated WP to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval and&#13;
for inclusion in the national budget to ensure that appropriate allocations are made for the financing of&#13;
the share of the project incremental recurrent costs that is the responsibility of the oblast/cities. The&#13;
investment costs included in the WP will have to be clearly spelled out and included in the approved&#13;
government PIP. The WPs will include the following: (a) a statement of the objectives to be pursued for&#13;
the coming year; (b) an up-to-date inventory of all social assets in the city; (c) a detailed description of&#13;
social assets; (d) cost reduction measures (proposed closures and divestitures/other measures to reduce&#13;
costs; (e) total costs for the budget year (rehabilitation, equipment, supplies, and incremental recurrent&#13;
costs); (f) financial plan (World Bank/local financing); (g) city cash flow; and (h) conclusions and&#13;
recommendations. The WPs will be submitted to the Bank for review and comments at the same time&#13;
they are submitted to the PCU. The Bank will review the WPs and make comments and suggestions as&#13;
appropriate. The WPs will form the basis for the implementation of project activities in any given year.&#13;
5.12       Assurances were obtained at negotiations that within one month of the end of each quarter,&#13;
each department, agency and administrative unit of the Borrower involved in project implementation will&#13;
prepare quarterly progress reports for submission to the Bank through the PCU (para 7.3 (q)). These&#13;
will be compiled and presented as project quarterly reports by the PCU. The first report will be issued&#13;
three months after Loan effectiveness. These reports will include: (a) a summary of project activities by&#13;
component; (b) a description of the main achievements against agreed implementation and disbursements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
age 39                                                                            Chapter V&#13;
schedules, and of the problems encountered; (c) recommendations on how to solve problems and&#13;
comments on progress in implementing previous reconmmendations; (d) a description of component&#13;
activities; (e) a presentation of the financial situation of the project in terms of actual versus budget for&#13;
the major expenditure categories and the financing of these categories; and (f) a presentation of the&#13;
financial situation of the component. By February 15, 1996 and by the same date each subsequent year,&#13;
each departmentlagency and administrative unit of the Government involved in project implementation&#13;
will prepare an annual implementation progress report, which shall then be made available to the Bank&#13;
through the PCU (para 7.3 (f)). The quarterly and annual reports will be prepared by the CCs in each&#13;
implementing agency. The reports from the cities will be consolidated with an introduction describing&#13;
the major achievements and problems by the oblasts CCs before being submitted to the PCU for final&#13;
clearance. The reports cleared by the PCU wili be forwarded to the Bank. Preparation of reports will&#13;
be facilitated by the project monitoring and MIS, which will be designed prior to Loan effectiveness.&#13;
5.13       Assurances were obtained at negotiations that by June 30, 1997: (a) the Borrower shall&#13;
undertake a mid-term review of the implementation of the project in consultation with, and in a manner&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank (para 7.3 (n)); and (b) by September 30, 1997, prepare and furnish to the Bank&#13;
a report regarding the results of the mid-term review, including progress achieved in the implementation&#13;
of the project and measures recommended to ensure the achievement of project objectives during the&#13;
remainder of the project life (para 7.3 (o)).&#13;
5.14       Monitoring. It will be done in five main areas: (i) the procurement and physical delivery&#13;
of goods; (ii) the physical implementation of project activities; (iii) the impact on service delivery; (iv)&#13;
the financial management and control of project funds; and (v) the institutional development under the&#13;
project. A continuous assessment of these activities will be done under the context of the Implementation&#13;
Schedule (Annex 9) and, more specifically, the annual work programs. Project implementation progress&#13;
and the effective utilization of project resources will be monitored through well defined Performance&#13;
Monitoring Indicators (Annex 7). Project management at the MOL and at the oblast and city levels, and&#13;
with technical assistance to be provided under the project will establish the required Management&#13;
Information Systems (MIS) necessary for the reporting and evaluation of these indicators. The indicators&#13;
will first be defined in the WPs and then be reported in the quarterly and annual reports along with the&#13;
basic financial information.&#13;
Bank Supervision&#13;
5.15       The proposed project focuses on two key areas of the social safety net -- support to&#13;
retrenched workers and divestiture of social assets from enterprises. With limited experience in the latter&#13;
area, intensive Bank supervision will be necessary, especially during the first two years of project&#13;
implementation to help identify and solve problems at an early stage and to ensure that the rationalization&#13;
plans conform with agreed targets. The Supervision Plan in Annex 10 estimates a requirement of 40 staff&#13;
weeks for supervision in PYI (4 missions) and 37 staff weeks for PY2 (3 missions, including the mid-&#13;
term review). A local high level staff to be recruited in the Bank's Resident Mission in Almaty will&#13;
participate in project supervision and facilitate day-to-day contact with the PCU. The performance&#13;
monitoring indicators will be used for monitoring of project implementation and impact by supervision&#13;
missions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATIONS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
6.1         The policy making capacity of the Employment Service will be improved, and the basis laid&#13;
for a program of social protection to retrenched workers. The provision of an effective social safety net&#13;
will remove constraints on labor mobility and improve public support for the Government's economic&#13;
strategy. Enterprise restructuring will be facilitated in the selected cities by the orderly divestiture of&#13;
social assets. The project will foster rationalization of local social service budget management and&#13;
improve public social investment programs in the selected cities. Improvements in the cost effectiveness&#13;
of local social expenditures will have a net positive impact on the central budget, reducing the need for&#13;
increased budgetary allocations resulting from divestiture, while allowing local governments to operate&#13;
additional divested social services. Experience with the rationalization programs in the two oblasts will&#13;
facilitate replication/improvement of the approach subsequently throughout the country.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
6.2        In a newly created country undergoing fundamental economic transformation, there is an&#13;
inevitable risk of policy changes and implementation delays. The project faces five main risks: (i) the&#13;
Government's limited experience with Bank-financed projects and overall limited administrative capacity;&#13;
. (ii) the complexity of the issues to be addressed; (iii) introduction of user fees for health services may&#13;
be delayed because changes in the legislation need to be introduced; (iv) the Government may find it&#13;
difficult to sustain the level of management, coordination, and budgetary effort required to succeed in the&#13;
divestiture process; and (v) delays in implementing policy reforms may jeopardize project implementation.&#13;
The project would help offset these risks by: putting in place strong institutional arrangements;&#13;
implementing the Social Services Component in oblasts/cities where the local administrations are&#13;
committed to implementing structural changes in the social sector, through rationalization of social service&#13;
expenditures, generating substantial cost savings in the running of social assets; providing management&#13;
support and training for the implementation of the rationalization plans, including building a national&#13;
capacity through the training of financial staff both at the central and oblast/city level; and providing&#13;
technical assistance to the ES to implement improved organizational procedures prior to project start-up.&#13;
In addition, the project's technical assistance inputs and the reporting relationships and responsibilities&#13;
of the PCU are being designed so as to minimize the risks, which would also be given particular attention&#13;
by supervision missions.&#13;
C. Environmental Impact&#13;
6.3         The proposed project comprises technical assistance, training, introduction of management&#13;
infornation systems, modest rehabilitation of health care facilities and kindergartens; and provision of&#13;
essential medical equipment and drugs. As such, no adverse impact on the environment is expected from&#13;
the proposed project (Screening Category C).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

            Kazakstan - Social Protection Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Social Protection Project seeks to:
            1) develop the capacity of the Employment Service in the
            Department of Employment (DOE) of the Ministry of Labor
            (MOL) to manage the expected increase in the number of
            registered unemployed and attendant benefit claims following
            the restructuring and privatization of enterprises; and 2)
            ensure continued delivery of essential social services, by
            promoting orderly divestiture of social assets from
            enterprises, and efficient management by municipalities of a
            unified system of social services. To meet these objectives,
            the project has two main components: 1) an Employment
            Service (ES) Component to be implemented at both national
            and regional levels; and a Social Services Component, to be
            implemented in selected cities of South Kazakstan and
            Pavlodar oblasts. The Employment Service (ES) Component will
            strengthen the institutional capacity of the ES to register
            the unemployed and calculate and pay unemployment benefits;
            provide a more effective service to unemployed jobseekers;
            and analyze labor markets and formulate labor market
            policies. The Social Services Component will facilitate the
            transfer of essential social services from restructuring
            enterprises to local governments, and rationalize management
            of all basic services in five selected cities : Shymkent
            City, Kentau, Lenger, Pavlodar City, and Aksu.
