Partnerships&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Partnerships continued to play an important role in helping MIGA extend its outreach and leverage&#13;
its resources during fiscal 2004. The Agency engages in partnerships with other insurers, government&#13;
agencies and international organizations with several goals in mind: to ensure complementary services&#13;
and approach; to strengthen its technical assistance activities and online information services; to&#13;
increase the capacity of the political risk insurance industry; and to encourage insurers into frontier&#13;
markets where they may not feel comfortable venturing on their own.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In fiscal 2004, MIGA signed Memoranda of                     activities with several partners, including the European&#13;
Understanding (MOUs) with five partners, bringing            Agency for Reconstruction in the Balkans, the&#13;
the total number of MOUs to 37. Most of these                Commonwealth Secretariat for the Pacific Islands, and&#13;
partners are export credit agencies or development           the European Community for its investment programs&#13;
finance institutions. The partnerships encourage joint       in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the         ix&#13;
&#13;
marketing initiatives and cooperation in coinsurance         Pacific Islands. In addition, MIGA worked closely with&#13;
and reinsurance activities. MIGA regularly provides          the Austrian and Swiss governments in designing&#13;
training for its partners in an effort to build their insti- and implementing donor-funded investor outreach&#13;
tutional capacity and capability to provide political risk   programs for Africa and Europe and Central Asia, and&#13;
insurance. In fiscal 2004, MIGA held training programs       with the Japanese government, under the Development&#13;
for partners from Europe and Canada and participated         Gateway Foundation, for an online information service&#13;
in a regional training program held in Iran.                 about FDI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MIGA also works closely with public and private&#13;
insurance partners through reinsurance and coin-&#13;
surance arrangements. The Agency has collaborated&#13;
with several of these insurers and other partners to&#13;
stimulate discussion and share knowledge about&#13;
the challenges and best practices of the political risk&#13;
insurance industry. In fiscal 2004, the results of a major&#13;
symposium, co-sponsored by MIGA and Georgetown&#13;
University in Washington, D.C., were published in&#13;
a book, International Political Risk Management: The&#13;
Brave New World.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MIGA's online information services depend on part-&#13;
nerships with content providers. In fiscal 2004, MIGA&#13;
signed 17 content provider agreements, bringing the&#13;
total number of such providers to 88. The Agency also            PHOTO | Training program, Kish Island,&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
                                  For most developing countries, official development assistance and local&#13;
                                  private resources are not sufficient to stimulate economic growth and&#13;
                                  provide the opportunities needed for improved quality of life. With the right&#13;
                                  regulatory and policy climate, foreign investment is vital for bringing access&#13;
                                  to what is needed--capital, technology and managerial and environmental&#13;
                                  best practices--to spur development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  MIGA's mission is to enable developing countries build up their local&#13;
                                  economies, reduce poverty and improve people's lives through promoting&#13;
                                  foreign direct investment. MIGA does this in two ways: its political risk&#13;
                                  insurance makes a difference between a productive foreign investment going&#13;
                                  ahead or not; and its technical assistance activities help equip countries&#13;
                                  with the tools necessary to attract and retain foreign investments.&#13;
 IMPACT&#13;
&#13;
                                  MIGA-sponsored projects cover a range of sectors that convey many direct&#13;
                                  benefits to host countries, including local job creation, skills transfer and&#13;
                                  a general positive impact on the economy through fiscal revenues and&#13;
                                  export earnings.&#13;
       DEVELOPMENT&#13;
&#13;
                       MAKING A   A significant portion of the Agency's portfolio is in support of financial&#13;
                                  services and infrastructure, fundamental building blocks of economic&#13;
                      DIFFERENCE&#13;
2                                 development. Within the infrastructure sector, MIGA has been increasingly&#13;
                                  in demand for water projects, because the Agency is able to provide guar-&#13;
                                  antees at the sub-sovereign level--the level at which the vast majority of&#13;
                                  water concessions are handled. In fiscal 2004, MIGA supported two water&#13;
                                  projects in China and one in Russia. These projects ensure the supply&#13;
                                  of safe and reliable drinking water--a Millennium Development Goal--&#13;
                                  helping reduce child mortality and the risk of disease. Without this basic&#13;
                                  service, economic activity cannot thrive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  MIGA's increasing efforts to integrate its activities with the Country&#13;
                                  Assistance Strategies (CASs) of the World Bank Group will further enhance&#13;
                                  the Agency's development impact. As each CAS is prepared in consultation&#13;
                                  with government officials, civil society organizations, development partners&#13;
                                  and other stakeholders, MIGA is better able to ensure that its technical&#13;
                                  assistance activities and guarantee projects are consistent with country&#13;
                                  priorities and supportive of partner initiatives. During fiscal 2004, MIGA&#13;
                                  collaborated closely with World Bank Group country teams to develop&#13;
                                  innovative approaches to facilitate FDI in Indonesia, Kenya, Mozambique&#13;
                                  and Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  The development themes discussed in this year's annual report focus on&#13;
                                  two important areas where MIGA has been active in promoting foreign&#13;
                                  direct investment. The first describes MIGA's support for small and&#13;
                                  medium enterprises. Smaller companies constitute most of the private&#13;
                                  business sector in developing countries and a thriving SME sector is&#13;
                                  therefore critical to creating long-term employment and alleviating poverty.&#13;
                                  The second theme highlights MIGA's efforts to help countries assess their&#13;
                                  competitiveness and develop improved strategies to attract and retain&#13;
                                  appropriate FDI.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Reaching out to Small and&#13;
Medium Enterprises&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) can jump-start economic growth in even the poorest of&#13;
countries. Indeed, they offer what is often the only hope of a better livelihood for millions of entre-&#13;
preneurs and workers in developing countries. In Africa, according to the United Nations Industrial&#13;
Development Organization, SMEs constitute some 90 percent of all private commercial enterprises&#13;
currently in operation. But SMEs face enormous obstacles, particularly in developing countries where&#13;
lack of access to finance, insufficient internal resources and management capabilities, and legal and&#13;
regulatory barriers pose significant challenges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Foreign direct investment (FDI) can play an important     rently account for more than 70 percent of RBRO's&#13;
role in SME development, either through joint ventures    total lending portfolio.                                     3&#13;
&#13;
with local partners or through the establishment of&#13;
wholly foreign-owned enterprises. FDI brings access to    One of RBRO's SME clients is Altipo Construction Ltd.&#13;
finance, new technologies, modern business practices      (Altipo), a company involved in importing, assembling&#13;
and market links for smaller companies. To date, the      and installing windows. Altipo started operations in&#13;
bulk of MIGA's support for SMEs--more than 70             1997 with three employees. Today the company employs&#13;
percent--has been through the provision of guarantees     some 80 workers and in 2003 had an annual turnover&#13;
to financial institutions that lend to SMEs. FDI into the of e1.6 million. The company needed fast access to&#13;
financial sector of developing countries has not only     financing in order to maintain its growth and turned&#13;
helped improve access to capital by SMEs, but has         to RBRO for a loan in 2003. "With RBRO we found the&#13;
introduced new technologies, better services and new      flexibility and willingness to offer solutions that would&#13;
products in the banking systems of these countries.       help our company grow," says Sorin Boureanu, Altipo's&#13;
                                                          General Manager.&#13;
Raiffeisen Bank S.A. Romania (RBRO), whose lending&#13;
operations are supported by long-term loans from its&#13;
Austrian parent, Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich&#13;
AG (RZB), has been a beneficiary of MIGA's SME&#13;
focus. Cumulatively, MIGA has provided guarantees&#13;
worth around e80 million against the risks of currency&#13;
transfer restrictions and expropriation of funds for&#13;
RZB's loans and interest repayments to its Romanian&#13;
subsidiary. A site visit and review of RBRO's oper-&#13;
ations in fiscal 2004 confirmed that the bank is having&#13;
a positive development impact. Its operations have&#13;
helped improve the access of the Romanian SME&#13;
sector to term financing and has provided a wide range&#13;
of financial products and services to clients throughout&#13;
the country through an extensive branch network. The&#13;
bank has also introduced new products--such as&#13;
leasing--along with modern methods of cash man-&#13;
agement to the Romanian financial sector. SMEs cur-&#13;

To date, MIGA has supported 117 projects that directly&#13;
benefit SMEs--14 projects in fiscal 2004 alone. One&#13;
such project is in Uganda, where the SME sector has&#13;
played a key role in the country's remarkable turn-&#13;
around. In fiscal 1999, MIGA issued two guarantees&#13;
worth $6.5 million in coverage, for an investment by&#13;
Afriproduce Ltd. (a UK-based company) in Ugacof&#13;
Ltd., a Ugandan coffee processing facility. The&#13;
insurance covers the company against the risks of&#13;
transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil&#13;
disturbance. This support was critical at a time when&#13;
Uganda was still facing economic difficulties. A site&#13;
visit to the country in fiscal 2004 showed the project's&#13;
significant impact on the local economy. The company&#13;
has introduced cost-effective processing techniques&#13;
to produce coffee for export, and buys the bulk of its&#13;
coffee beans from small-scale farmers, paying cash on&#13;
delivery. The company has made regular contributions&#13;
to local schools and installed a facility to give the local&#13;
community better access to water. With more than 200            PHOTO | Ugacof Ltd., Uganda&#13;

&#13;
    This study of foreign direct investment costs and con-&#13;
    ditions in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,&#13;
    Thailand, and Vietnam was funded under the Miyazawa&#13;
    Initiative, a special component of the Japanese foreign&#13;
    assistance program intended to promote economic&#13;
    recovery in the countries most affected by 1997&#13;
    Asian financial crisis. The efforts of the Multilateral&#13;
    Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) under this ini-&#13;
    tiative also supported capacity building in the national&#13;
    investment promotion intermediaries of Korea,&#13;
    Thailand and the Philippines, and raised awareness of&#13;
    the importance of non-commercial risk insurance in&#13;
    fostering the flow of foreign direct investment.&#13;

                         Although the global economy started to recover in fiscal 2004, the operating environment for the political&#13;
                         risk insurance industry remained challenging. FDI into developing countries declined in 2003 for the&#13;
                         second consecutive year, dropping to an estimated $135 billion from $175 billion in 2001, a fall of 23&#13;
                         percent. While some countries, such as China, experienced record inflows, most others encountered&#13;
  OVERVIEW               sharp declines. In many countries, ongoing political and economic uncertainties limited the appetite of&#13;
                         large foreign investors. Overall, investors were more reluctant to make new investments in developing&#13;

                                        Over the past two fiscal years, MIGA has provided&#13;
                                        a total of $186 million worth of guarantees for&#13;
                                        the equity investments and debt financing for&#13;
                                        the project. MIGA's involvement was needed&#13;
                                        to unlock the transaction's financing. It is the&#13;
                                        first project that involves both MIGA guarantees&#13;
                                        and an IDA partial-risk guarantee. The Agency&#13;
                                        also collaborated with insurance partners, who&#13;
                                        provided reinsurance for the project.&#13;

                                        in the project area. In addition, the project will&#13;
                                        provide significant revenues to the Mozambican&#13;

&#13;
In fiscal 2004, demand for MIGA's technical assistance services continued to&#13;
increase, as client countries sought to promote themselves to investors amid a&#13;
difficult international market for FDI. In response, MIGA focused on developing&#13;
new tools and approaches to serve its diverse group of client countries and&#13;
investment promotion intermediaries (IPIs).&#13;

The European Investor Outreach Program (EIOP)&#13;
Despite significant political, legal and macroeconomic&#13;
reforms over the past decade in the Western Balkans,&#13;
levels of FDI have remained low, especially relative to&#13;
Central Europe. Investor perceptions still seem to be&#13;
adversely affected by past conflicts in the region. To&#13;
address the issue, MIGA and the government of Austria&#13;
signed a grant agreement in October 2003 to launch&#13;
the EIOP, which is designed to strengthen the capacity&#13;
of Western Balkan countries to attract investment from&#13;

                                           MIGA issued a guarantee of $15 million to Crédit Lyonnais, S.A. of France for its swap&#13;

                                           716.8 MW combined cycle, gas-fired electric generating plant. The swap agreements&#13;
                                           permit the project to pay a fixed rate of interest on loans rather than a floating rate, which&#13;
                                           presents financial risk. The guarantee covers a period of 15 years against the risks of&#13;
                                           transfer restriction, expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and breach of contract.&#13;

                                           MIGA's coverage of the swap agreements complements its initial support of PM3 in FY03,&#13;
                                           when it provided $43.2 million in equity coverage and $75 million for a non-shareholder&#13;

Sichuan was chosen for this initiative because&#13;
investment in China has been concentrated on the&#13;
coast, and the government and the World Bank Group&#13;
have agreed that development of the western and north-&#13;
eastern provinces is a priority. MIGA's efforts in Sichuan&#13;
have generated considerable interest in the Agency's&#13;
investment promotion activities at the national level&#13;
in China. The Chinese national investment promotion&#13;
agency--CIIPA--has requested MIGA's assistance&#13;
in establishing its role and that of a newly created&#13;
entity, the Federation of China Investment Promotion&#13;
Agencies, in investment promotion. A program of&#13;
assistance is now being drawn up by MIGA and FIAS&#13;
with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce aimed at&#13;
developing the skills of sub-national level investment&#13;
promotion agencies in the southwest and northeast&#13;
of the country. A "train-the-trainers" initiative and the&#13;

                                      During fiscal year 2004, MIGA issued four guarantees totaling e66.55 million ($78.5 million)&#13;
                                      to Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich AG (RZB) for its shareholder loans to Raiffeisen Bank&#13;
                                      d.d. Bosnia I Herzegovina (RBBH). The guarantees issued were in the amounts of e19&#13;
                                      million ($21.8 million), e23.8 million ($29.0 million), e19 million ($22.0 million) and e4.75&#13;
                                      million ($5.7 million). The guarantees for the four projects cover periods of nine, three,&#13;
                                      seven and seven years, respectively, and provide coverage against the risks of transfer&#13;

  ACTIVITIES&#13;
                                      In fiscal 2003, MIGA provided coverage to RZB for its EUR 10 million shareholder loan to&#13;
                                      RBBH. The new guarantees cover further expansion of the project enterprise's lending&#13;
                                      program in fiscal 2004. The additional shareholder loans provided by RZB will help RBBH&#13;
            REGIONAL                  strengthen its capital base and increase its lending in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&#13;
&#13;
                                      RBBH offers a wide range of products and services, including payment services, retail&#13;

                                      MIGA provided an additional e3.5 million ($4.0 million) in reinsurance to the Slovene Export&#13;
                                      Corporation for the political risk insurance it has provided to Poslovni Sistem Mercator&#13;

&#13;
                                      The project involves operating a shopping mall in the center of Sarajevo. Since 2002,&#13;
                                      cash flows have been positive, and the new equity investment is aimed at positioning the&#13;
                                      investor for a possible expansion in the country.&#13;
&#13;
                                      The shopping center creates positive externalities for customers and local suppliers. It&#13;
                                      increases the availability and the quality of goods in Sarajevo. In the first years of operation,&#13;
                                      Mercator developed partnerships with producers from Bosnia and Herzegovinia, and local&#13;
                                      goods represent over twenty-five percent of goods sold in the supermarket. In addition,&#13;
                                      approximately fifty percent of goods sold come from Slovenia.&#13;
&#13;
                                      The project hosts a bank, a pharmacy, and other services and fosters private sector growth.&#13;
                                      It employs over 200 workers who received training from a staff exchange with Mercator&#13;
                                      shopping centers in Slovenia and Croatia.&#13;

              MIGA issued a guarantee of e1.26 million ($1.4 million) to the International Dialysis&#13;
              Centers B.V. of the Netherlands for its e2.0 million equity investment in International&#13;
              Dialysis Center Banja Luka of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The guarantee covers a period of&#13;
              seven years and provides coverage against the risk of breach of contract.&#13;
&#13;
              The project--an expansion of an earlier MIGA-supported health care facility located in&#13;
              Banja Luka--is providing renal dialysis treatment services to the city of Bijeljina in the&#13;
              Republika Srpska region, where kidney disease is endemic. Using state-of-the-art medical&#13;
              equipment, the project is helping to improve life expectancy and the quality of life for&#13;
              dialysis patients.&#13;
&#13;
              The project supports the World Bank Group's country assistance strategy, which promotes&#13;
              social services, such as high-quality and accessible health care, as a fundamental step in&#13;
              building social sustainability in the medium-term. (For more on this project, see Box 1,&#13;

              MIGA provided an additional e4.6 million of coverage to Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank AG (HAAB)&#13;
              of Austria for its e5.1 million equity investment in Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank AD Banja Luka&#13;
              (HAAB Banja Luka) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The investment is guaranteed for a period&#13;
              of 10 years and coverage is provided against the risks of expropriation and war and civil&#13;
              disturbance&#13;
&#13;
              In FY03, MIGA issued a e13.8 million guarantee to HAAB of Austria for a e15.4 million&#13;
              equity investment in HAAB Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This amount, combined&#13;
              with the new investment brings HAAB's total equity invested in HAAB Banja Luka to e20.5&#13;
              million; MIGA's coverage of both investments amounts to e18.4 million.&#13;
&#13;
              The project involves the recapitalization of HAAB Banja Luka and the further expansion&#13;
              of its lending activities. In addition to increasing the capacity of the financial sector, the&#13;
              project is expected to benefit the local economy by on-lending to a variety of businesses.&#13;
&#13;
              The latest equity investment will support the objectives of last year's expansion efforts,&#13;
              yielding direct and indirect development impacts for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The project&#13;
              will bolster the credit capacity of the local economy while bringing know-how, technical&#13;
              solutions, and new products to the local market. The project will also provide extensive&#13;
              training for bank employees. While the project will not directly contribute to export&#13;
              earnings, the expansion of funds to local businesses is expected to facilitate up to $50&#13;
              million in exports annually.&#13;

           shareholder loans to Raiffeisen Bank S.A. (RBRO) of the Republic of Romania. The guar-&#13;
           antees are for a period of seven years and provide coverage against the risks of transfer&#13;
           restriction and expropriation. In fiscal 2003, MIGA issued a $38 million guarantee to&#13;
           Raiffeisen Bank S.A. for a $40 million shareholder loan to the same project enterprise. The&#13;
           project's expansion efforts have broadened the range and quality of commercial banking&#13;
           services in Romania and have helped lower the costs of financing.&#13;
&#13;
           The new investments in the bank are expected to help support economic development in&#13;
           Romania in a number of ways. First, the shareholder loans will bolster the bank's capital&#13;
           base, allowing RBRO to increase its medium-term lending, which will support investments&#13;
           in new equipment. Second, RBRO expects that much of its lending (more than 50%) will&#13;
           support local SMEs through a special SME-EBRD line of credit, helping improve their&#13;
           access to loans. Third, the project will continue to invest heavily in training and technology&#13;
           development. Finally, RBRO will bring state-of-the-art technical infrastructure to Romania,&#13;
           including a new operations center, and update key IT capabilities.&#13;

                                   The project involves the establishment and operation of four diagnostic centers by SC&#13;
                                   Euromedic Romania s.r.l., based on a public-private partnership with the national health&#13;
                                   care service. The diagnostic centers will provide MRI, computer, tomography, bone densi-&#13;
                                   tometer, ultrasound, and stress tests diagnostic services.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Euromedic's health care services should make a significant contribution to Romania's&#13;
                                   social services infrastructure by offering diagnostic services to a broad range of patients. In&#13;
                                   addition, the four clinics will hire about 240 permanent medical employees and managers.&#13;
                                   The local annual procurement for goods and services for the four clinics is expected to total&#13;
                                   $2.1 million. Government tax and fee revenue from Euromedic's operations is expected to&#13;
                                   total around to $1 million annually.&#13;

&#13;
Responding to Energy Crisis&#13;
MIGA provided coverage for a shareholder loan to the&#13;
TermoCabo power plant in Brazil. The plant will supply&#13;
peak-time electricity to the people of Pernambuco,&#13;
one of the poorest states of Brazil. As a result, power&#13;
rationing, previously common during periods of&#13;
drought, has substantially decreased. The project is&#13;
part of the Emergency Energy Program enacted by&#13;
the Brazilian government to respond to the country's&#13;
severe energy shortage.&#13;

                                    the drought-prone state of Pernambuco, in North-East Brazil. With ninety percent of the&#13;
                                    country's installed generating capacity in the form of hydro-electric power, the sustained&#13;
                                    lack of rainfall has resulted in power shortages and electricity rationing.&#13;
&#13;
                                    The project diversifies the sources of power supply and helps to meet short-term electricity&#13;
                                    demand in Pernambuco. The project employs forty local staff for ongoing plant operational&#13;

&#13;
                                    The plant has been designed to ensure compliance with both MIGA and Brazilian envi-&#13;
                                    ronmental requirements. An upcoming air quality check will monitor the noise levels and&#13;

            MIGA issued a guarantee of $17.9 million to Elecnor S.A. of Spain for its loan guarantee of&#13;
            $18.9 million in support of Cachoeira Paulista Transmissora de Energia Ltda. of Brazil. The&#13;
            guarantee is for a period of three years and provides coverage against the risks of breach&#13;
            of contract, and currency transfer restriction and inconvertibility.&#13;
&#13;
            The project involves the construction of an $80 million power transmission line in the&#13;
            State of São Paulo which will increase transmission capacity as well as improve the reli-&#13;
            ability of electricity supply. MIGA's participation in the project is consistent with the World&#13;
            Bank's objectives of supporting Brazil's power sector. The project is considered crucial for&#13;
            the country's economic development because it bolsters transmission capacity which is&#13;
            considered a priority in Brazil's electricity development program for 1999-2008.&#13;
&#13;
            A total of 1,200 workers will be hired during the construction phase and about 30 people&#13;

                        investment climate in Ethiopia, enabling the country&#13;
                        to conclude bilateral treaties with France and Germany.&#13;
                        MIGA is helping to settle claims outstanding from the&#13;
                        expropriation of foreign assets during the Mengistu&#13;
                        regime. The resolution of these claims is expected to&#13;
                        send a strong signal to the international business com-&#13;
                        munity and encourage FDI into the country.&#13;

                        MIGA supported and co-funded an investment&#13;
                        outreach program under a partnership with the Swiss       Sector Breakdown of Total Guarantees Issued Since&#13;

                        in four countries: Ghana, Mozambique, Senegal and&#13;
                        Tanzania. In fiscal 2004, the program targeted the&#13;
                        apparel, textile, call center and tourism industries. The&#13;
                        outreach program has already resulted in concrete&#13;

 KENYA      Geosurvey International, LLC&#13;
            East Africa Geosurvey Ltd.&#13;
&#13;
            Priority Areas: IDA, SSA&#13;
&#13;
            MIGA issued a guarantee of $1.4 million to Geosurvey International, LLC of the US for its&#13;
            $1.5 million equity investment in East Africa Geosurvey Ltd. of Kenya. The guarantee is for&#13;
            a period of 15 years and provides coverage against the risks of transfer restriction, expro-&#13;
            priation, war and civil disturbance, and breach of contract.&#13;
&#13;
            The project involves the development of a computerized database system for Kenyan local&#13;
            authority councils, which will link landbase mapping and land parcel data with property&#13;
            ownership and taxation records in a Land Information System. The project aims to&#13;
            strengthen municipal councils' property assessment procedures, as well as taxation and&#13;
            fees collection systems.&#13;
&#13;
            The project will have several important developmental impacts for the Kenyan economy.&#13;
            Since property taxes in Kenya generally provide 20 percent of the total revenues of local        49&#13;
            governments and 1 percent of central government revenue, East Africa Geosurvey Limited's&#13;
            operations could potentially bolster state and community coffers. It is estimated that, with&#13;
            the help of the project, local governments will be able to double the collection of property-&#13;
            related taxes and fees within three years in the counties and towns participating in the&#13;
            project. The project will also permanently employ about 500 local workers. In addition, the&#13;
            project's operations will yield many peripheral benefits to local communities, including&#13;
            improving access to accurate property information, updating the local address system,&#13;
            improving consumer access to mortgages, and enabling municipal governments to issue&#13;
            bonds and access capital markets.&#13;
&#13;
            The project is consistent with the World Bank Group strategy for Kenya, which focuses&#13;
            on supporting government efforts to improve economic governance and achieve fiscal&#13;
            adjustment. East African Geosurvey Limited will create an opportunity for better tax col-&#13;
            lection and possibly better municipal services.&#13;

                                  $25.7 million for its respective loans of $92.4 million to the Republic of Mozambique&#13;
                                  Pipeline Investment Company (Pty.) Ltd. (ROMPCO) of South Africa and $27 million to&#13;
                                  Sasol Petroleum Temane Limitada (SPT) of Mozambique. Both SPT and ROMPCO are&#13;
                                  wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Sasol Limited Group. The guarantees are for a period&#13;
ACTIVITIES                        of up to 13 years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, war and civil dis-&#13;
                                  turbance, and breach of contract.&#13;
&#13;
                                  MIGA's coverage of the loans replaces two equity guarantees issued in fiscal 2003 to the&#13;
          REGIONAL                Sasol Limited Group in support of its initial investments in ROMPCO and SPT. A portion&#13;
                                  of the guarantees issued by MIGA has been reinsured under the Agency's facultative rein-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
50                                MIGA's guarantees support the development of Mozambique's Temane and Pande gas&#13;
                                  fields and the construction of a 865 km cross-border gas pipeline in Mozambique and&#13;
                                  South Africa. The project represents the first cross border initiative in sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
                                  in developing regional natural gas markets and will generate many benefits for the local&#13;
                                  economy, including government revenues estimated to be in excess of $2 billion over&#13;
                                  the project's 25-year lifetime. Contracts for local purchases of goods and services on an&#13;
                                  ongoing basis are estimated to be more than $1 million per year.&#13;
&#13;
                                  The project will substantially add to Mozambique's infrastructure through the development&#13;
                                  of roads, water supplies and the removal of land mines. Environmentally, the project will&#13;
                                  contribute to the reduction of harmful emissions by replacing heavy oils and sulphur-rich&#13;
                                  coal with clean burning natural gas. (For more on this project, see Box 3, page 17).&#13;

                      FINANCIAL OVERVIEW&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      Income from Guarantees&#13;
                      As of June 30, 2004, total guarantees issued stood at US$1,076 million1. The gross and net exposures amounted to US$5,186 million and&#13;
                      US$3,259 million compared to US$5,083 million and US$3,204 million at June 30, 2003. In FY04, income from guarantees, comprised of&#13;
                      earned net premium income, fees and commissions, amounted to US$40.9 million, compared with US$39.5 million in FY03. MIGA's annual&#13;
                      premium income is largely driven by its average net exposure during that year, which in turn is determined by two offsetting factors: new&#13;
                      guarantees and contract cancellations, expiries, reductions and replacements. While the volume of MIGA's FY04 new guarantee business was&#13;
                      smaller than that of FY03, a significant decrease in the volume of contract cancellations, expiries, reductions and replacements (net $578.8&#13;
                      million, compared with FY03's $826.6 million) contributed to a slight increase in the net exposure.&#13;

                       Capital Increase&#13;
                       On March 29, 1999, MIGA's Council of Governors approved a General Capital Increase (GCI) of US$850 million, to be subscribed over&#13;
                       three years. On May 6, 2002, the Council of Governors approved the extension of the subscription period by one year to March 28, 2003.&#13;
                       On March 17, 2003, the Council of Governors approved an amendment to the GCI resolution allowing eligible countries to reserve the&#13;
                       GCI shares allocated to them by submitting an instrument of contribution before the GCI deadline of March 28, 2003, and requesting&#13;
                       such countries to subscribe to their GCI shares as soon as possible. The reserved shares are issued and corresponding voting power&#13;
                       accrues when the subscription process reaches completion, i.e., when the required payment has been received. As of June 30, 2004,&#13;
                       cumulative subscriptions to the GCI totaled 63,084 shares equivalent to US$682.6 million. This represents 80.3% of the total number of&#13;
                       shares authorized under the GCI.&#13;

Risk Bearing Capacity&#13;
For the purpose of measuring its risk-bearing capacity, MIGA uses the ratio of operating capital (which includes paid-in-capital, retained    57&#13;
earnings and general reserves) over net exposure. This ratio which increased from 23.9 in FY03 to 24.9 in FY04 remains satisfactory.&#13;

Purpose&#13;
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), established on April 12, 1988, is a member of the World Bank Group which&#13;
also includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the&#13;
International Development Association (IDA). MIGA's activities are closely coordinated with and complement the overall development&#13;
objectives of the other members of the World Bank Group. MIGA is designed to help developing countries attract productive foreign&#13;
investment by both private investors and commercially operated public sector companies. Its facilities include guarantees or insurance&#13;
against noncommercial risks and a program of advisory services and technical assistance to support member countries' efforts to&#13;
attract and retain foreign direct investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Note A: Summary of Significant Accounting and Related Policies&#13;
&#13;
MIGA's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards and with accounting&#13;
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The policy adopted is that considered most appropriate to the circum-&#13;
stances of MIGA having regard to its legal requirements and to the practices of other international insurance entities. On August 3,&#13;
2004, MIGA's Board of Directors approved the financial statements for issue.&#13;
&#13;
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards and accounting&#13;
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the&#13;
amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following summary of policies&#13;
adopted by MIGA is provided to assist readers in the interpretation of these financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
Translation of Currencies MIGA's financial statements are expressed in terms of United States dollars solely for the purpose of sum-&#13;
marizing MIGA's financial position and the results of its operations for the convenience of its members and other interested parties.&#13;
      MIGA is an international organization that may conduct its operations in the currencies of all its members. MIGA's resources&#13;
are derived from its capital and retained earnings in its members' currencies. MIGA strives to minimize exchange rate risks in a multi           71&#13;
currency environment. As such, MIGA attempts to match its contingent obligations in any one currency with assets in the same&#13;
currency on a pro-rata basis.&#13;
      MIGA may periodically undertake currency conversions on a pro-rata basis to match the currencies underlying its reserves with&#13;
those of its contingent obligations. The purpose of these conversions will be to minimize currency exposure that may occur through&#13;
operations. Otherwise, MIGA will not convert one currency into another except for small amounts required to meet certain operational&#13;
needs.&#13;
      Assets and liabilities are translated at market exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Capital subscriptions are stated&#13;
in accordance with the procedures described below. Income and expenses are translated at either the market exchange rates in effect&#13;
on the dates on which they are recognized or at an average of the market exchange rates in effect during each month. Translation&#13;
adjustments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.&#13;
&#13;
Valuation of Capital Stock Under the MIGA Convention, all payments from members subscribing to the capital stock of MIGA shall be&#13;
settled on the basis of the average value of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) in terms of United States dollars for the period January 1,&#13;
1981 to June 30, 1985, such value being equal to $1.082 for one SDR.&#13;
&#13;
Investments As part of its overall portfolio management strategy, to diversify its credit exposure to commercial banks and to obtain&#13;
higher returns, MIGA invests in government and agency obligations and time deposits according to its credit risk and maturity policies.&#13;
Government and agency obligations include highly rated fixed rate bonds, notes, bills and other obligations issued or unconditionally&#13;
guaranteed by governments of countries or other official entities including government agencies or by multilateral organizations.&#13;
      Investments classified as available-for-sale, which are those securities that may be sold prior to maturity as part of asset/liability&#13;
management or in response to other factors, are carried at fair value with any changes in fair value reported in the Balance Sheet as a&#13;
component of accumulated other comprehensive income.&#13;
&#13;
Revenue Recognition      Revenue from premium payments for direct insurance and reinsurance contracts assumed and ceded is rec-&#13;
ognized on a pro-rata basis over the contract period. Revenue from commitment fees, which are fees paid by investors to reserve for a&#13;
limited period of time guarantee capacity for future use, is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the commitment period.&#13;
&#13;
Reserve for Claims The reserve for claims provides for probable losses, net of future premiums, inherent in guarantee operations based&#13;
upon an estimation of the net present value of future premium income as compared to the net present value of future losses related&#13;
to guarantee operations. MIGA has incurred only one loss to date (see Note D). Accordingly, MIGA has computed expected future&#13;
losses by reference to (i) the loss experiences of other insurers engaged in similar underwriting, (ii) the composition and volume of out-&#13;
standing guarantee contracts, and (iii) the worldwide economic and political environment. This reserve is available to absorb probable&#13;
losses inherent in outstanding guarantees and is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by claims settlements.&#13;
      The level of provision is based upon management's evaluation of probable losses, net of future premiums, that may result from (i)&#13;
risks that are inherent, but unidentifiable at the time of reporting, (ii) large concentrations of exposure to individual risks, countries or&#13;
guarantee contracts, and (iii) an ongoing assessment of MIGA's expected recovery rates. Sufficient claims reserves are established at&#13;
the end of each year to cover all of the inherent probable losses arising from contracts outstanding at that time on a net present value&#13;
basis; future provisions are then established to reflect changes in MIGA's outstanding portfolio.&#13;
      In the event of a formal filing of claim by an investor, and upon receipt of full evidence of the occurrence of the covered risk, MIGA&#13;
normally has between two months and six months to determine its liability under the contract, depending upon the type of coverage&#13;
and contract terms, and 60 days thereafter to pay the claim.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                         Accounting and Reporting Developments         On January 17, 2003, FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable&#13;
                         Interest Entities ­ an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46). During December, 2003, FASB replaced FIN 46 with FASB Interpretation&#13;
                         No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ­ an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46R). FIN 46 and FIN 46R defines certain&#13;
                         "variable interest entities" (VIEs) and require parties to such entities to assess and measure variable interests in the VIEs for the&#13;
                         purpose of determining possible consolidation of the VIEs. Enterprises are required to apply the provisions of either FIN 46 or FIN 46R&#13;
                         to financial statements issued for periods ending after December 15, 2003. Enterprises are required to apply the full provisions of FIN&#13;
                         46R to financial statements issued for periods ending after March 15, 2004. MIGA analyzed various investments under the provisions&#13;
                         of FIN 46R as of June 30, 2004, and as a result, did not identify any material variable interests in VIEs as of that date.&#13;
                               At its March 31, 2004 meeting, the FASB ratified the consensuses reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) on Issue&#13;
                         No. 03-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments." EITF 03-1 provides clarity&#13;
                         on the manner in which a company should evaluate and measure other-than temporary impairment on securities including available&#13;
                         for sale securities. As noted in Note B, as part of its ongoing investment monitoring process, and based on the quality of MIGA's&#13;
                         investment portfolio, MIGA has concluded that, as of June 30, 2004, there was no other than temporary impairments that had not been&#13;
                         recognized. MIGA management believes that MIGA's process for assessing other than temporary impairment on its investments is&#13;
                         effective and in accordance with EITF 03-1.&#13;
                               In December 2003, as part of its improvements to International Accounting Standards (IAS) project, IASB issued fifteen revised&#13;
                         International Accounting Standards to eliminate redundancies and conflicts between exiting standards. The revised standards are to&#13;
  EMENTSTA               be applied for fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2005. MIGA is currently examining what impact these standards may have on&#13;
                         MIGA's's financial statements.&#13;

As part of its ongoing investment monitoring process, and based on the quality of MIGA's investment portfolio, MIGA has concluded&#13;
that, as of June 30, 2004, there was no other than temporary impairments that had not been recognized. MIGA management believes that&#13;
MIGA's process for assessing other than temporary impairment on its investments is effective and in accordance with EITF 03-1.&#13;

                         NOTE C: Capital Stock&#13;
&#13;
                         The MIGA Convention established MIGA's authorized capital stock at 100,000 shares with a provision that the authorized capital stock&#13;
                         shall automatically increase on the admission of a new member to the extent that the then authorized shares are insufficient to provide&#13;
                         the shares to be subscribed by such member. At June 30, 2004, the initial authorized capital stock increased to 104,937 (103,196 ­ June&#13;
                         30, 2003) shares. The Convention further states that 10 percent of the members' initial subscription be paid in cash, in freely convertible&#13;
                         currencies, except that developing member countries may pay up to a quarter of the 10 percent in their own currencies. An additional&#13;
                         10 percent of the initial subscription shall be paid in the form of nonnegotiable, non interest bearing promissory notes. The notes are&#13;
                         denominated in freely convertible currencies and are due on demand to meet MIGA's obligations. The remaining 80 percent is subject&#13;
                         to call when required by MIGA to meet its obligations.&#13;
                               On March 29, 1999, the Council of Governors approved a General Capital Increase (GCI) resolution increasing the authorized&#13;
                         capital stock of MIGA by 78,559 shares to be subscribed by members during the subscription period ending March 28, 2002. Of the addi-&#13;
                         tional capital, 17.65 percent is to be paid in cash, in freely usable currency. The remaining 82.35 percent is subject to call when required&#13;
                         by MIGA to meet its obligations. On May 6, 2002, the Council of Governors adopted a resolution to extend the GCI subscription period to&#13;
                         March 28, 2003. On March 17, 2003, the Council of Governors approved an amendment to the GCI resolution allowing eligible countries&#13;
                         to subscribe to the GCI shares allocated to them by submitting an Instrument of Contribution before the GCI deadline of March 28, 2003,&#13;
  EMENTSTA               and requesting such countries to pay for their GCI shares as soon as possible. The reserved shares will be issued and corresponding&#13;
                         voting power will accrue when the subscription process has been received.&#13;
          ST&#13;
                               At June 30, 2004, MIGA's authorized capital stock comprised 183,496 shares of which 168,021 (163,745 ­ June 30, 2003) shares had&#13;
                         been subscribed. Each share has a par value of SDR10,000, valued at the rate of $1.082 per SDR. Of the subscribed capital, $347,557,000&#13;
                         ($338,948,000 ­ June 30, 2003) has been paid in; and the remaining $1,470,430,000 ($1,432,773,000 ­ June 30, 2003) is subject to call. Of&#13;
                         the amounts paid in, at June 30, 2004, $108,968,000 ($105,509,000 ­ June 30, 2003) is in the form of nonnegotiable, noninterest bearing&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
NOTE D: Guarantee Program and Contingent Liabilities&#13;
&#13;
Guarantee Program MIGA offers guarantees or insurance against loss caused by noncommercial risks (political risk insurance) to&#13;
eligible investors on qualified investments in developing member countries. MIGA insures investments for up to 20 years against&#13;
four different categories of risk: currency inconvertibility and transfer restriction, expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and&#13;
breach of contract. Currency inconvertibility and transfer restriction coverage protects the investor against inconvertibility of local&#13;
currency into foreign exchange for transfer outside the host country. Currency depreciation is not covered. Expropriation coverage&#13;
protects the investor against partial or total loss of the insured investment as a result of acts by the host government that may&#13;
reduce or eliminate ownership of, control over, or rights to the insured investment. War and civil disturbance coverage protects&#13;
the investor against losses from damage to, or the destruction or disappearance of, tangible coverage assets caused by politically&#13;
motivated acts of war or civil disturbance in the host country including revolution, insurrection, coups d'etat, sabotage and ter-&#13;
rorism. Breach of contract coverage protects the investor against the impossibility to obtain or to enforce an arbitral or judicial&#13;
decision recognizing the breach of an obligation by the host government. Investors may insure projects by purchasing any com-&#13;
bination of the four coverages. MIGA guarantees cannot be terminated unilaterally by the guarantee holder within the first three&#13;
years from the date of issuance. Premium rates applicable to issued contracts are fixed for five years. Payments against all claims&#13;
under a guarantee may not exceed the maximum amount of coverage issued under the guarantee.&#13;
      MIGA also acts as administrator of some investment guarantee trust funds. MIGA, on behalf of the trust funds, issues guar-&#13;
antees against loss caused by non-commercial risks to eligible investors on qualified investments in the countries specified in the&#13;
trust fund agreements. Under the guarantee trust fund agreements, MIGA, as administrator of the guarantee trust funds, is not&#13;
liable on its own account for payment of any claims under contracts of guarantees issued by MIGA, on behalf of such trust funds.&#13;
      As approved by the Board of Directors and the Council of Governors, the maximum aggregate amount of contingent liabilities&#13;
that may be assumed by MIGA is 350 percent of the sum of MIGA's unimpaired subscribed capital and its reserves plus such&#13;
portion of the insurance ceded by MIGA through contracts of reinsurance as the Board of Directors may determine. Accordingly,&#13;
at June 30, 2004, the maximum level of guarantees outstanding may not exceed $9,723,176,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Contingent Liability The maximum amount of contingent liability of MIGA under guarantees outstanding at June 30, 2004 totaled&#13;
$5,186,017,000 ($5,082,778,000 - June 30, 2003). The maximum amount of contingent liability is MIGA's maximum exposure to&#13;
                                                                                                                                            75&#13;
insurance claims, which includes "standby" coverage for which MIGA is committed but not currently at risk. At June 30, 2004, MIGA's&#13;
estimate of its actual exposure to insurance claims exclusive of standby coverage is $2,393,563,000 ($2,386,500,000 - June 30, 2003).&#13;
      Additional guarantee capacity committed was $nil at June 30, 2004 and 2003.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Claim As of June 30, 2004, MIGA had three pending claims for which specific liability has not yet been determined. Two of the pending&#13;
claims were expropriation claims for losses related to projects in Argentina. On the first claim, received in July 2002, the amount of&#13;
loss was not specified. However, the maximum aggregate liability under the contract amounts to $5 million. The claim determination&#13;
period is scheduled to end in July 2004. The second claim, received on January 13, 2004 was for losses amounting to $1.5 million. The&#13;
waiting period before claim recognition is scheduled to end on December 12, 2004. The third claim, involving two contracts, were for&#13;
claims under war and civil disturbance coverage resulting from an attack by guerillas on a project in Nepal. The claim, received on&#13;
April 6, 2004, amounted to US$144,660 of which approximately 60% is reinsured. The claim was recognized as valid, but the amount&#13;
of compensation is yet to be ascertained in light of further documentation to be provided by the investor. Final claim determination&#13;
will occur in July 2004.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NOTE E: Reinsurance&#13;
&#13;
Although MIGA obtains quota-share and facultative reinsurance to augment its underwriting capacity and to protect portions of its&#13;
insurance portfolio, it remains responsible to the insured client for the entire amount of the insurance contract. Of the $5,186,017,000&#13;
outstanding contingent liability (gross exposure) at June 30, 2004 ($5,082,778,000 - June 30, 2003), $1,927,255,000 was ceded through&#13;
contracts of reinsurance ($1,878,789,000 - June 30, 2003). Net exposure amounted to $3,258,762,000 as at June 30, 2004 ($3,203,989,000&#13;
- June 30, 2003).&#13;
      MIGA can also provide both public (official) and private insurers with reinsurance. As of June 30, 2004, total insurance assumed&#13;
by MIGA, primarily with official investment insurers, amounted to $121,838,000 ($122,238,000 - June 30, 2003).&#13;
      Premiums relating to direct, assumed, and ceded contracts for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2004 and June 30, 2003 were as&#13;

&#13;
                         Changes to the gross reserve for claims for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2004 and June 30, 2003 were as follows:&#13;

          ST             At June 30, 2004, the specific reserve amounted to $27,700,000 ($39,200,000 - June 30, 2003). This includes an IBNR reserve which&#13;
                         includes contracts where a claimable event has taken place but no claim has been filed and a reserve for notified claims. As of June&#13;
                         30, 2003, the specific claims reserves also included a special reserve which was previously established to reflect MIGA management's&#13;
                         assessment of a significant increase in risk in certain countries and for which MIGA management believed that a claim notification may&#13;
                         have been imminent. As of June 30, 2004, this special reserve was eliminated.&#13;
            FINANCIAL&#13;
                                Reinsurance recoverables have been estimated in proportion to the reserve for claims and on the basis of a review of the selected&#13;
                         contracts in force and other available information.&#13;

76                       NOTE G: Staff Retirement Plan and Other Postretirement Benefits&#13;
&#13;
                         IBRD has a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP) and a Post-Employment Benefits plan (PEBP)&#13;
                         that cover substantially all of its staff members as well as the staff of IFC and of MIGA.&#13;
                                The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and life insurance&#13;
                         benefits to eligible retirees. The PEBP provides pension benefits administered outside the SRP. All costs associated with these plans are&#13;
                         allocated between IBRD, IFC, and MIGA based upon their employees' respective participation in the plans. In addition, IFC and MIGA&#13;
                         reimburse IBRD for their share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD.&#13;
                                Net income from the SRP that has been allocated to MIGA for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 and June 30, 2003 was $nil. The&#13;
                         portion of the cost for RSBP and the PEBP for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 was $419,600 ($506,000 ­ June 30, 2003). In addition,&#13;
                         at June 30, 2004, MIGA had a receivable from IBRD in the amount of $15,820,776 ($14,966,419 ­ June 30, 2003) representing the accu-&#13;
                         mulated excess of its contributions to pension assets over its allocated net periodic pension cost.&#13;
                                During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, MIGA recorded Staff Retirement expense of $805,284 which has been included in&#13;

                         services can be most efficiently provided by IBRD. These include human resources, information systems, and administrative services as&#13;
                         well as investment management and treasury operations. Payments for these services are made by MIGA to IBRD based on negotiated&#13;
                         fees, charge backs and allocated charges where charge back is not feasible. Expenses allocated to MIGA for the fiscal year ended June 30,&#13;
                         2004, were $3,478,296 ($1,725,914 - June 30, 2003).&#13;

                         NOTE I: Estimated Fair Values&#13;
&#13;
                         The estimated fair values of MIGA's cash and non-negotiable, non interest-bearing demand obligations approximate their carrying&#13;
                         values. The estimated fair value of MIGA's investments shown in Note B is based on market quotations. The estimated fair values are&#13;
                         only indicative of individual financial instruments' values and should not be considered an indication of MIGA's fair value.&#13;

                         NOTE J: Subsequent Event&#13;
&#13;
                         On July 13, 2004, MIGA received notice from a guarantee holder that a claimable event under expropriation coverage had occurred&#13;
                         with respect to a project in the Kyrgyz Republic. The waiting period is scheduled to end on June 28, 2005. The maximum aggregate&#13;
                         liability under the guarantee contracts is approximately $11.4 million. Provisions had been established for these contracts under specific&#13;
                         reserves at June 30, 2004.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Although a small agency, the
            Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has a broad
            mandate-to promote productive foreign direct investment
            (FDI) flows into developing countries.  The Agency's
            results in fiscal 2004 were mixed. While the total amount of
            guarantees issued fell slightly, to $1.1 billion, a greater
            proportion of projects supported were in the poorer
            countries eligible for financing from the International
            Development Association (IDA).  In membership, the Islamic
            Republic of Iran and Suriname joined MIGA, bringing the
            number of member countries to 164.  Highlights for the year
            include: first guarantee coverage for investors from the
            Czech Republic and Poland; three water projects
            supported-two in China and one in Russia; 16 projects
            supported in conflict-affected countries; 65 technical
            assistance activities conducted in 29 countries, along with
            regional and global initiatives; new technical assistance
            work initiated in Afghanistan, China, Mali, Paraguay, South
            Africa and Tajikistan; the European Investor Outreach
            Program launched with co-funding from the Austrian
            government; and FDI Promotion Center launched.
