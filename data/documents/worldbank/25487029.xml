&amp;#12;    Africaâ&#128;&#153;s development and climate agendas are inextricably linked: If unaddressed,&#13;
    climate change and variability will jeopardize Africaâ&#128;&#153;s hard-won development&#13;
    achievements and thwart its aspirations for further growth and poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Erosion and coastal flooding are taking lives and reducing productivity in West&#13;
    Africa. They are the most visible evidence of the climate changes affecting the&#13;
    regionâ&#128;&#153;s coastal areas. The degradation and vulnerability of coastal areas is a&#13;
    cause of serious concern.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Context&#13;
    West Africaâ&#128;&#153;s coastal areas host an abundance of natural resources, on land and at sea,&#13;
    that provide vital ecosystem services and help buffer against severe weather events. These&#13;
    resources play a key role in the economic and physical resilience of coastal regions to&#13;
    existing and future challenges.&#13;
&#13;
    The coastal zone is home to 31 percent of West Africaâ&#128;&#153;s populationâ&#128;&#148;and the figure is&#13;
    expected to rise. Across Sub-Saharan Africa, urban population growth is growing at an&#13;
    annual rate of 4 percent, almost twice the worldwide average of 2.1 percent. In West Africa&#13;
    rapid urbanization and net migration to the coasts put further demand on the land, its&#13;
    resources, and the services the ecosystem provides to people.&#13;
&#13;
    The coastal is zone is also the source of 56 percent of West Africaâ&#128;&#153;s GDP. It is home to&#13;
    major industries, including agro-industry, fisheries, offshore petroleum exploration and&#13;
    production, and tourism, as well as city and seaside residences. Poor choices about the&#13;
    location of infrastructure and groins, limited environmental governance, and human-in-&#13;
    duced pollution, coupled with population pressures and overexploitation of coastal&#13;
    natural resources, have led to rapid degradation of coastal ecosystems. The degradation&#13;
    manifests itself in the form of coastal erosion and flooding, depletion of fisheries, and&#13;
    disease.&#13;
&#13;
    Climate change will exacerbate the environmental stresses along the coast, increasing the&#13;
    socioeconomic vulnerability of coastal populations, especially the poor, whose well-being&#13;
    and livelihoods depend on the quality and quantity of natural resources (figure 1).&#13;
    Interventions are needed at all levels of government and society to decrease the vulnera-&#13;
    bility of the poor in coastal West Africa.&#13;
&#13;
    Spurred by erosion and flooding disasters, West African countries have started to take&#13;
    action. Acting alone at the national level is insufficient to tackle the challenges, however.&#13;
    A regional approach is needed, because preventing erosion in one country can cause ero-&#13;
    sion in its neighbors and because the financing needed to contain erosion and flooding&#13;
    is too great for individual countries to raise or manage. Countries need to work together&#13;
    in a coordinated manner, at both the policy and the technical levels, and strategically use&#13;
    available funding provided to manage priority erosion and flooding hotspots.&#13;

                                           West Africa Coastal Areas Management Program (WACA)                    3&#13;
&amp;#12;    WACA: A Regional Approach to&#13;
    Coastal Development&#13;
&#13;
    T&#13;
            he West Africa Coastal Areas Management Program (WACA) was established by the&#13;
            World Bank in 2015 in response to demand from countries in the region to manage&#13;
            their growing coastal erosion and flooding problems. Recognizing that multisec-&#13;
    toral investments are neededâ&#128;&#148;in land management and planning, infrastructure, natural&#13;
    habitat management, and pollution managementâ&#128;&#148;these countries asked for technical&#13;
    assistance to determine the key factors that are increasing the vulnerability of the people,&#13;
    ecosystems, and assets along the coast, making them especially susceptible to the con-&#13;
    sequences of climate-related and man-made pressures. Countries already participating&#13;
    in the program include Benin, CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire, Ghana, Mauritania, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe,&#13;
    Senegal, and Togo, and discussions are under way with other countries.&#13;
&#13;
    WACA is designed to improve the livelihoods of coastal communities in West Africa by&#13;
    reducing the vulnerability of its coastal areas and promoting climate-resilient integrated&#13;
    coastal management. The programâ&#128;&#153;s mix of technical assistance and investments will seek&#13;
    to preserve and rehabilitate the natural coastal resources essential for livelihoods; spur&#13;
    economic development and increase social welfare; and support the sustainable develop-&#13;
    ment of key growth sectors, such as agro-industry, fisheries, off-shore petroleum explora-&#13;
    tion and production, and tourism.&#13;
&#13;
    WACA is also a convening platform to help countries obtain the finance and expertise&#13;
    they need to sustainably manage their coastal areas. It also serves as a forum within which&#13;
    countries and regions can share lessons learned.&#13;
&#13;
    The World Bank is committed to supporting countries in low-carbon and climate-resilient&#13;
    growth and poverty reduction. As part of the 17th International Development Association&#13;
    (IDA) Replenishment, the World Bank Group committed to support a number of IDA&#13;
    countries in their efforts to prepare multisector investments plans and better manage the&#13;
    disaster risks and other effects of climate change. WACA is the vehicle for this response&#13;
    for the coastal areas of West Africa.&#13;

&amp;#12;                 The Development Challenge&#13;
                 Unsustainable infrastructure development, inadequate management of natural&#13;
                 habitats and resources, and pollution are threatening the productivity of coastal&#13;
                 ecosystems in West Africa. Climate changeâ&#128;&#147;related events such as sea-level rise,&#13;
                 land subsidence, storm surge, and coastal flooding are exacerbating the regionâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                 vulnerability.&#13;
&#13;
                 How can coastal countries manage their coastal landscapes to spur economic&#13;
                 growth and reduce poverty while adapting to the effects of climate change?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             Interventions, Actions, and Themes&#13;
             Countries face difficult decisions in crafting solutions to development challenges in the&#13;
             coastal zone. Making the right choice requires decision-support tools and appropriate&#13;
             legal and institutional frameworks. Table 1 identifies some possible solutions and their&#13;
             rationales.&#13;

                                                   West Africa Coastal Areas Management Program (WACA)                         5&#13;
&amp;#12;    WACA is built on three pillars:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 strategic investment planning, including the formulation and prioritization of key&#13;
       policies and sectoral investments to foster adaptation to climate change build&#13;
       socioeconomic resilience&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 knowledge, information, and capacity building, including multihazard vulnerability&#13;
       assessments in select urban areas, cost-benefit analyses of adaption options, and the&#13;
       creation of stronger national coastal areas information systems&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 country and regional engagement and resource mobilization, including analysis of&#13;
       stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; roles and responsibilities, political economy studies, and identification of&#13;
       funding and finance opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
    It will also address a number of cross-cutting themes that are central to the analytical work:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Natural accounts: Natural accounting of coastal services would build on the Wealth&#13;
       Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystems Services (WAVES) Partnership on protection&#13;
       services of coastal ecosystems, particularly mangroves and coral reefs.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Innovative financing: The monetized value of coastal services and their benefits would&#13;
       remain in the country and be reinvested locally.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Participatory risk planning and governance: Local communities would participate in&#13;
       coastal areas management and disaster prevention planning.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢	 Social protection for vulnerable coastal communities: The program would target the&#13;
       most vulnerable people, through alternative livelihoods, social protection, and labor-&#13;
       intensive public works.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Stakeholders&#13;
    The main stakeholders of the program are its ultimate beneficiaries: the people who live&#13;
    along the West African coast and depend on it for their livelihood and prosperity. The&#13;
    program will collaborate with national decision makers, including the ministries of finance,&#13;
    planning, economy, environment, agriculture, transport, energy, and others, as well as civil&#13;
    society. National and international academia, research institutes, and nongovernmental&#13;
    organizations will be engaged in analytical work and projects as appropriate. Subregional&#13;
    and regional organizations, private sector, and donors will provide technical and financial&#13;
    support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6   West Africa Coastal Areas Management Program (WACA)&#13;
&amp;#12;   Partners&#13;
   WACA is based on collaborative arrangements agreed upon by donors and&#13;
   partners, including the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), the&#13;
   Nordic Development Fund (NDF), and the multidonor Africa Climate Investment&#13;
   Readiness Partnership Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 WAEMU funded and prepared the Regional Shoreline Monitoring Study and&#13;
      the Management Scheme for the West African coastal area. It is currently&#13;
      co-financing the West Africa Coastal Area Erosion and Adaptation project.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 NDF is financing the West Africa Coastal Area Erosion and Adaptation project,&#13;
      which will operate in Benin, CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire, Ghana, and Togo. The project aims to&#13;
      enhance regional and national governance in the target countries and improve&#13;
      their knowledge of coastal erosion, flooding, and other climate change hazards.&#13;
      It will be the first building block of a future technical assistance and investment&#13;
      program in the West Africa coastal area.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 The Africa Climate Investment Readiness Partnership is funding a regional&#13;
      technical assistance program on Building Climate Resilience of Coastal Areas in&#13;
      West Africa, which works with West African countries to design climate-resilient&#13;
      integrated coastal management development and investment plans, enhance&#13;
      their capacity at the national and regional levels, and improve their investment&#13;
      readiness. Participating countries are Benin, CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire, Mauritania, SÃ£o TomÃ©&#13;
      and Principe, and Togo.&#13;
&#13;
   The World Bank Group is also in dialogue with other partners and donors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Way Forward: A Regional and&#13;
National Investment Program&#13;
WACA is the strategic foundation for the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s long-term engagement in&#13;
West Africaâ&#128;&#153;s coastal areas. Its aim is to work with countries to create multiyear, multicoun-&#13;
try coastal management initiatives that will be implemented in several stages, in collab-&#13;
oration with other development partners. This initiative will lead to the scaling up of key&#13;
knowledge and capacity-building activities and help prepare the design and implementa-&#13;
tion of priority infrastructure investments.&#13;
&#13;
In support of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)&#13;
process, the World Bank developed a 2015â&#128;&#147;18 Africa Climate Business Plan, â&#128;&#156;Stepping&#13;
up Support for Africaâ&#128;&#153;s Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Development.â&#128;&#157; WACA is part&#13;
of that plan, which proposes $1 billion in investments and technical assistance to build&#13;
coastal zone resilience.&#13;

            A partnership for saving West Africa’s
            coastal assets
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            West Africa’s coastal areas host an
            abundance of natural resources, on land and at sea, that
            provides vital ecosystem services and help buffer against
            severe weather events. These resources play a key role in
            the economic and physical resilience of coastal regions to
            existing and future challenges. Poor choices about the
            location of infrastructure and groins, limited environmental
            governance, and human-induced pollution, coupled with
            population pressures and overexploitation of coastal natural
            resources, have led to rapid degradation of coastal
            ecosystems. Regional approach is needed, because preventing
            erosion in one country can cause erosion in its neighbors
            and because the financing needed to contain erosion and
            flooding is too great for individual countries to raise or
            manage. Countries need to work together in a coordinated
            manner, at both the policy and the technical levels, and
            strategically use available funding provided to manage
            priority erosion and flooding hotspots. The West Africa
            coastal areas management program (WACA) was established by
            the World Bank in 2015 in response to demand from countries
            in the region to manage their growing coastal erosion and
            flooding problems. As part of the 17th International
            Development Association (IDA) replenishment, the World Bank
            Group committed to support a number of IDA countries in
            their efforts to prepare multi-sector investments plans and
            better manage the disaster risks and other effects of
            climate change. WACA is the vehicle for this response for
            the coastal areas of West Africa.
