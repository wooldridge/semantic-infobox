            Expanding water and sanitation services to
            low-income households : the case of the La Paz-El Alto concession
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Bolivia is one of a growing number of
            developing countries turning to the private sector to
            improve urban water and sanitation services. The
            country's first major contract in the sector, a
            twenty-five-year concession for the neighboring cities of La
            Paz and El Alto, was implemented in August 1997. A primary
            objective in moving to a private concession was to expand
            services to low-income households while holding down costs
            by increasing efficiency. It is not a foregone conclusion
            that the new concessionaire will do a better job of
            expanding service; much will depend on how well the contract
            and sector regulation have been designed. Because the La
            Paz-El Alto concession was explicitly designed to expand
            service to the poor, this concession is a good case study
            for evaluating how different provisions in the contract and
            the sector regulation may help or hinder service expansion.
