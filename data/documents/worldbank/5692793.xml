Self Supply: A Fresh Approach&#13;
to Water for Rural Populations&#13;
&#13;
Self supply is a demand-driven approach, built on the widespread desire of rural populations to invest&#13;
in water solutions that directly benefit small groups or households. Research in Zambia has found&#13;
widespread grassroots demand for small-scale water supply improvements, and has subsequently&#13;
developed models by which communities could improve the quality of their supplies.&#13;

Summary                                                                                            Map of Zambia&#13;

&#13;
Every year, thousands of rural householders and small groups invest&#13;
in traditionally dug wells and scoopholes to provide convenient water&#13;
supplies which they manage and maintain themselves. These water&#13;
sources number over a million in Africa alone. Many rural people value&#13;
these sources for their convenience, taste, productive use and, most&#13;
importantly, the sense of ownership and control bestowed. However,&#13;
policymakers tend to regard them as a liability to be replaced rather than&#13;
improved or augmented, and rural water supply strategies continue to&#13;
concentrate on communal supplies for groups of 200 to 500 people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Research in Zambia has found widespread grass-roots demand for small-&#13;
scale water supply improvements1, and has subsequently developed&#13;
models by which communities could improve the quality of their supplies.&#13;

Self supply builds on the widespread desire of the rural poor to invest in                       may be out of service at any given&#13;
solutions that benefit their small group or household directly, rather than                      time, generally due to the problem&#13;
as members of what are often scattered or discordant communities. It's                           of handpump breakdown. Problems&#13;
components include improved availability of water from an increased                              of affordability, availability of spare&#13;

                                                                                           to Water for Rural Populations&#13;

  Table 1: Comparison of attributes of conventional and self supply systems&#13;
&#13;
  Conventional communal systems                                 Self supply options&#13;
&#13;
  Best suited to nucleated, homogeneous communities             Suited to individual households and small groups&#13;
  with good leadership&#13;
&#13;
  Technologies available for a wide variety of conditions,      Easily established where water is within 15 meters of surface&#13;
  with greater flexibility in siting                            or rainwater adequate&#13;
&#13;
  Focuses on outside knowledge and remote technologies          Builds on local knowledge, attitudes, and skills&#13;
&#13;
  Serves large numbers of people, who may or may not            Serves households or small groups forming natural&#13;
  form a community                                              management units&#13;
&#13;
  Safety and quality of water usually assumed, not always       Significant improvements in water quality, comparable to fully&#13;
  correctly; perceived value among users may be less than       protected communal shallow wells but at much reduced cost;&#13;
  assumed                                                       high perceived value among users&#13;
&#13;
  Generally marketed for health benefits; income                Often generates multiple benefits including income, improved&#13;
  generation often difficult because of communal                nutrition, and local employment&#13;
  ownership&#13;
  Depends on committee management which is not                  Well-defined ownership and management by individual or&#13;
  traditional and may take time to develop                      well-established group&#13;
&#13;
  Provides good water within 0.5 to 1 kilometer, but            Provides good water, usually within household boundary or&#13;
  households may have nearer alternative sources                within 100 meters&#13;
&#13;
  Requires large investment per unit, and very high             Low unit cost means that subsidy can be less than 50 percent&#13;
  subsidies (usually around 95 percent; typically US$15­20      (Zimbabwe 20 percent) (typically US$3­5 per capita)&#13;
  per capita)&#13;
&#13;
  Rapid construction, but construction teams not involved       Rapid small changes, slower process to reach final product,&#13;
  in maintenance                                                construction teams also do maintenance&#13;
&#13;
  Long-term maintenance is expensive, requiring heavy           Regular and long-term maintenance can be carried out by&#13;
  equipment and transport                                       local artisans, including redeepening at low cost&#13;
&#13;
  Higher standards from the start but sustainability may be     Gradual steps towards high standards, each bringing&#13;
  low                                                           sustainable improvement&#13;
&#13;
  Often donor driven                                            Develops directly from local demand&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusions                                 conventional communal supplies              deserves wider application, and&#13;
                                            and their associated high-cost              is capable of bringing about rapid&#13;

Self supply is a demand-driven              technologies, and offers a more             and widespread change among the&#13;

approach. The demand is expressed           sustainable solution among                  most remote of rural communities&#13;

            Self supply: a fresh approach to water for
            rural populations
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In Zambia, around 3 million rural people
            lack access to safe water, and use springs, unlined wells,
            and scoopholes as drinking water sources. Subsidies for
            communal supplies, such as boreholes with handpumps or piped
            supplies, generally target larger communities, although up
            to 50 percent of communities in some districts are smaller
            than 80 people. Even when upgraded water supplies exist, the
            proportion of handpumps not functioning ranges from 10 to 35
            percent, depending on the province and time since
            installation or rehabilitation. Recognizing this situation,
            the Zambian government endorsed the Department for
            International Development (DFID)-funded research project to
            look at ways to mobilize the rural poor, especially those
            living in scattered settlements, to improve their own water
            supplies sustainably and with minimal subsidies. The project
            covered family wells and all traditional supplies,
            especially scoopholes and springs.
