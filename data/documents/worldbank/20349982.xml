including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;

considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;

with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time,&#13;
including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to&#13;
prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to&#13;
finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the&#13;
Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge&#13;
that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset&#13;

Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;

additional financing.&#13;

Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to&#13;
request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by&#13;
amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable&#13;

Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;

Lebanon Syrian Crisis Trust Fund (LSCTF)&#13;
Governance Structure&#13;
1.     The LSCTF is overseen by a Steering Board (SB) which is established by decision of the Council of&#13;
Ministers. The SB would provide overall strategic direction and priorities for the program financed by the&#13;
LSCTF. The SB would comprise: (i) a Government of Lebanon representative; (ii) the World Bank; (iii) the&#13;
UN, on behalf of its specialized agencies; and (iv) contributing donors. The Steering Board meetings would&#13;
be co-chaired by the Government of Lebanon and a World Bank representative and would be scheduled bi-&#13;
annually or as needed to assess the progress, strategy and priorities for the LSCTF.&#13;
2.     The SB would be supported by a Technical Group (TG). The TG would be responsible for: (i)&#13;
recommending specific projects; (ii) agreeing on projects' implementation modalities; (iii) collating and&#13;
presenting implementation status reports to the SB. The TG would comprise representation from: (i) Sector&#13;
Ministries germane to LSCTF's activities; (ii) Council for Development and Reconstruction; (iii) Ministry of&#13;
Finance; (iv) the World Bank; (v) the UN ; and (vi) representatives from contributing donors. The TG would&#13;
meet quarterly or as needed. Meetings would be conducted in person, or virtually.&#13;
3.     A World Bank Secretariat, comprised of World Bank staff, will support a World Bank Task Team&#13;
Leader who will be responsible for the day-to day management of the LSCTF. The World Bank Secretariat&#13;
will be fully funded from the LSCTF. The World Bank Secretariat will develop an Operations Manual (OM)&#13;
for managing the LSCTF and provide support to the TG in program implementation following World Bank&#13;
policies and procedures as referenced in the OM.&#13;
4.     For the Recipient-executed activities, the Bank's policies and procedures will apply. In some cases,&#13;
it may be agreed that a project may be implemented by a UN agency. Funds could then be transferred to the&#13;
UN agency under the terms of the "World Bank-UN-Fiduciary Principles Accord", where the UN agency, a&#13;
signatory to the Fiduciary Principles Accord, would apply its own procurement, fiduciary and safeguard&#13;
policies. In such a case the UN agency, and not the World Bank, would be responsible for the use of these&#13;
transferred funds.&#13;

Standard Provisions&#13;
Applicable to&#13;
Grants&#13;
Made by the World Bank as Administrator of Various Trust Funds,&#13;
to&#13;
UN Organizations that are Signatories&#13;
to the&#13;
Fiduciary Principles Accord concluded in December 2008&#13;
April 2009&#13;
1.     Background.&#13;
1.1.   The operational policies of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ("IBRD")&#13;
and International Development Association ("IDA") (IBRD and IDA collectively referred to as "World&#13;
Bank"), provide that in the event of certain crises and emergencies in a member country of the World Bank&#13;
("Member Country"), the World Bank may, at the request of the Member Country, agree to special&#13;
implementation arrangements for early recovery activities financed by the World Bank out of the proceeds of&#13;
trust funds administered by the World Bank, including grants to UN agencies active in the Member Country&#13;
for such activities, along with capacity-building measures to enable a timely transfer of the implementation&#13;
responsibilities to the Member Country.'&#13;
1.2.   In order to facilitate the making of such grants, the World Bank and several United Nations&#13;
organizations (each a "UN-FPA Signatory"), have entered into a Fiduciary Principles Accord ("FPA") set&#13;
forth in the Attachment to these standard provisions ("FPA Standard Provisions"), pursuant to which the&#13;
Bank and the UN-FPA Signatories have agreed to special arrangements for the disbursement of such grants&#13;
and implementation of activities financed thereunder.&#13;
2.     General Terms and Conditions of FPA Grants.&#13;
2.1.   These FPA Standard Conditions set forth certain terms and conditions generally applicable to those&#13;
trust funds administered by IBRD or IDA that provide for the financing, out of the proceeds of such trust&#13;
funds, of grants to UN-FPA Signatories in accordance with the FPA ("FPA Grants"). They apply to the&#13;
extent specified in the agreement or agreements (each, an "Administration Agreement") between the World&#13;
Bank and donors ("Donors") for the establishment of each such trust fund ("Trust Fund").&#13;
2.2.   Each FPA Grant will be made:&#13;
(a)    only to a UN-FPA Signatory that is in compliance with its obligations under the FPA and&#13;
has not withdrawn from the FPA, at the time the FPA Disbursement Agreement (as defined in paragraph (b)&#13;
of this Section 2.2) is signed by the World Bank;&#13;
See, Operational Policy 8.00, Rapid Response To Crises And Emergencies,&#13;
-1I-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿(b)    on the terms and conditions set forth in a disbursement agreement entered into between the&#13;
World Bank and the UN-FPA Signatory substantially in the form of the agreement ("FPA Disbursement&#13;
Agreement") set forth in Annex 2 to the Attachment to these FPA Standard Provisions;&#13;
(c)    for the purposes of activities described in the FPA Disbursement Agreement (variously,&#13;
"Activities" or "Project") and on the basis of a budget ("Activities Budget"), both of which will have&#13;
previously been considered and approved for financing under an FPA Grant by the governance mechanism&#13;
established under the Administration Agreement which has authority to determine the allocation of funds in&#13;
connection with the Trust Fund ("Trust Fund Steering Committee") in accordance with the provisions of&#13;
Section 3 below; and&#13;
(d)    only after the World Bank has determined, on the basis of a request from the Member&#13;
Country, that implementation of these Activities by the UN-FPA Signatory, is appropriate under the World&#13;
Bank's Operational Policy 8.00 Rapid Response To Crises And Emergencies;&#13;
2.3.   The Donors understand and agree that each of the Activities for which an FPA Grant is made will be&#13;
carried out, and the proceeds of the FPA Grant will be received, administered, managed, expended, reported&#13;
on and audited exclusively in accordance with the regulations, rules, policies, procedures and administrative&#13;
practices of the UN-FPA Signatory, including those relating to its financial management, procurement, anti-&#13;
corruption, environmental, social and resettlement policies, as well as those relating to direct and indirect&#13;
costs (including indirect program support costs) and interest (collectively, "UN-FPA Signatory Policies"), all&#13;
in a manner consistent with the FPA and as specified in the FPA Disbursement Agreement.&#13;
2.4.   The World Bank shall, in the discharge of its duties to the Donors hereunder with respect to each&#13;
FPA Grant to a UN-FPA Signatory, be entitled to rely on any assurances or undertakings made by the UN-&#13;
FPA Signatory, including the undertaking to notify the World Bank if it concludes that it is no longer able to&#13;
give any of the assurances or undertakings provided by it under the FPA or under any other agreements&#13;
between it and the Member Country and or the World Bank relating to the Activities.&#13;
2.5.   The World Bank will have no responsibility towards the Donors with respect to the Activities or any&#13;
FPA Grant except as expressly provided in these FPA Standard Provisions.&#13;
3.     Procedures for Making FPA Grants&#13;
3.1.   The World Bank will ensure that, except as otherwise agreed by the Trust Fund Steering Committee,&#13;
no Activities will be eligible for financing under an FPA Grant unless and until:&#13;
(a)    the World Bank, as Administrator of the Trust Fund, has received the following:&#13;
(i)    A proposal describing the Activities (together with proposed financing amount and&#13;
budget), of such scope and in such detail as the Trust Fund Steering Committee may request&#13;
