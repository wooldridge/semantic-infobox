                   A CONVERSATION WITH ANDREW KAMARCK. III                     the Baak.     He was in Cargill's Asia    Depar~ent.    assigned to the&#13;

&#13;
                              November 3. 1985                                 talked with hia. and said. "I've got this kind of a job.                This is very&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER:    Andy. we talked a good deal yesterday about saae of the             find somebody for this. and you happen to have the guy.        11       Cargill was&#13;
&#13;
economics work in the Bank. but I wonder if there isn't a bit aore that        very good in that respect.        He agreed to release him. so that was how&#13;
&#13;
we might say today.     Kaybe we could introduce the subject by my asking      we got Bmmanual Levy to do statistical work.          This included the&#13;
&#13;
if you would say a bit about your recruiting of econaaists for your            statistical work that led to the World Tables and to the tables which&#13;
&#13;
staff.     What kinds of people were you seeking?                              are now the.&#13;
&#13;
KAMARCK:     I realized. when the Econcmics Departaent was set up. that we     OLIVER:     The   ~1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
had an enoraous opportunity.     I also realized that there was a very         KAKARCK:     Well. the Atlas uses part of those figures. but the World&#13;
&#13;
limited time. The way these things work in a bureaucracy. when you get         Development Report is largely based on that.&#13;
&#13;
the go ahead signal to do something. it doesn't last forever: you have              I had some very specific slots I wanted to fill. like the one 1&#13;
&#13;
to take advantage of it when it's there.    We were given an    eno~ous        just mentioned.        I wanted to build up some kind of a fiscal division.&#13;
&#13;
expansion of budget slots. and I knew it was very important to start           so I was looking for a fiscal economist.          We looked everywhere.         The&#13;
&#13;
filling the slots as soon as possible.                                         personnel department was very helpful in this respect.              There was a guy&#13;
&#13;
     One of the things that we did first was to look around the Bank to        named Harold Dyer in the department at that time. and he really got&#13;
&#13;
see if there were possibilities elsewhere in the Bank.       One of the jobs   caught up in it.       He went through all the records we had of people who&#13;
&#13;
that I wanted the Bconoaics Department to do was to work on collecting         had applied for jobs.       He wrote to institutions and people the Bank had&#13;
&#13;
the basic data we needed on developing countries. to start helping the         worked with asking for suggestions.       We had an enormous number of&#13;
&#13;
developing countries produce the kind of data they needed for their            names. and we went through all of them to find people and to recruit&#13;
&#13;
economic policies and that the aid agencies needed.    What I wanted was       them as fast as possible.        I devoted a lot of attention to this.           This&#13;
&#13;
a guy who was very good at statistics. a feel for statistics. and had a        is how we picked up David Henderson from the U. K.          He had been in&#13;
&#13;
tremendous drive in that respect.     I found out there was such a guy in      Greece. I think. at the time and was more or less floating.                We picked&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               3                                                                                 4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
up a guy from Brazil.    (What was his name1 Paolo Perriera. a double-             KAMARCK.:    Yes.&#13;
&#13;
barreled naae. I've forgotten it.)        He had a brilliant career after be       OLIVER:     Was David Kno:z: amongst those?&#13;
&#13;
left the Bank. became the central Bauk governor and all the rest of it.            KAMARCK:     I don't think so.     I don't recall. I certainly don't recall.&#13;
&#13;
Irving wu very helpful in this regard. because there were people he                OLIVER:     Do you care to say a word about Sandy Stevenson's coming to&#13;
&#13;
had run into over the years working in consultation with the Fund                  the Econaaica Department and the importance of your deputy?&#13;
&#13;
younger people and senior people whoa be regarded as good.           We went       KAHARCK:    When the department was set up. Berend DeVries became deputy.&#13;
&#13;
after thea.                                                                        DeVries did not take on the responsibilities of the deputy director in&#13;
&#13;
      Some of the we could only get on the basis of their coming for               the Bank's set up that he was supposed to take on.        He was more&#13;
&#13;
two or three years. so they wouldn't have to give up their careers at              interested in pursuing some of his own ideas of research.         He would get&#13;
&#13;
home: two Brazilians. for example. and an Israeli. David Kocher. who               involved in various matters that interested him. rather than taking on&#13;
&#13;
was very. very good.    We picked up Prank Taaagna. who had been at the            the day-to-day administrative role that the deputy director is supposed&#13;
&#13;
Federal Reserve Board and was a consultant.        He   did not want to come as    to take on.     After a period of time. it became very clear that that job&#13;
&#13;
a full time person. so we picked him up as a consultant.           We got Isaiah   was not being done.     We succeeded in making him an advisor to the&#13;
&#13;
Prauk of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.               departaent.     Later on. after McNamara came in. one time when Irving was&#13;
&#13;
We picked hia up as a consultant.         We were looking in some cases at         away on a long trip. a slot opened for an economic advisor in one of&#13;
&#13;
specific slots. specific backgrounds.        We also wanted to have a group        the area departments. and I went to McNamara and suggested that DeVries&#13;
&#13;
of ten people (Irving and I had discussed this) who had had a lot of               be given that slot.     He was transferred out of the Economics Department&#13;
&#13;
experience in developaent problems in their own countries and had                  into that slot.     We clearly needed soaebody who could do the job.&#13;
&#13;
worked in different institutions that we regarded as brilliant. hard-                   Sandy Stevenson at this point was Associate Director in the Asia&#13;
&#13;
driving. willing to work hard and could come up with ideas.          We tried      Department.     There had been two Asia Departments. one for South Asia.&#13;
&#13;
to do it as fast as possible. because we were pretty sure that this                and for the rest of Asia.        They were merged. One director. Peter&#13;
&#13;
opportunity would not last indefinitely.        It was true.   After two or        Cargill. became Director and the other. Sandy Stevenson. became&#13;
&#13;
three years. we were told that that was as far as we could go.                     Associate Director.     I talked to Peter as to whether or not he would&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   So these were the years.   1   64. '65. and perhaps '66. something       have any objections to Sandy's coming over and to Sandy to see if he&#13;
&#13;
like that.                                                                         would wish to come.     Sandy was interested.    He came over. took the job&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  5                                                                            6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of Deputy Director and did very â&#128;¢ very well.           He removed an enormous      deputy in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
mass of material and work from â&#128;¢â&#128;¢Â·                                                 OLIVER:     Was there a clear-cut division of responsibility between you&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:        I take it this whole story illustrates one of the things that       and Irving Friedman. or were many of the things you did you did&#13;
&#13;
we talked about yesterday in connection with economic adVisors:              a     jointly?&#13;
&#13;
person who is a good econoaiat and good econamic analyst need not                  KAHARQ&lt;:     No. there was not a clear-cut division. except in same&#13;
&#13;
necessarily be a good ad.iniatrator. or â&#128;¢&amp;Â¥ not seek to be an                      respects:     Irving was responsible for the relationship with the&#13;
&#13;
administrator.                                                                     President and defending the economics complex against the rest of the&#13;
&#13;
KAHARQC:       Very definitely. very definitely.       There are people who are    Bank.     He contributed strategic ideas to what the Economics Department&#13;
&#13;
interested in ideas and working with ideas and are not interested in               and what the Bank should do.      He   was there not simply as The Economic&#13;
&#13;
working with people; who do not have the self-discipline to be able to             Advisor to the President. but as a person whose job it was to look&#13;
&#13;
do the nuts and bolts. sometimes the very irkaoae details. that                    after the economic work of the Bank.       When Woods brought him to the&#13;
&#13;
administration consists of.          Very often it is very irksoae. and there      Bank. the role that he wanted Irving to consider was advising Woods on&#13;
&#13;
are soae people that can't bring tbeaaelves to do it.             It's better if   what the Bank as a whole was doing outside of the economics complex&#13;
&#13;
they recognize it and everybody else recognizes it.                                the strategy. the policy of the Bank as a whole. This was something&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:        Did you yourself have any qualas about doing administrative         that Irving was very good at. and this was very important to Woods.&#13;
&#13;
work after your long service as an economic advisor?                                       Some of the major initiatives of the Woods period. such as&#13;
&#13;
KAMARQ&lt;:       No.    At first. with DeVries there. I couldn't carry out my        changing the way in which everyone looked at the problem of resources&#13;
&#13;
intentions.          That is. I would devote   ~self   to the direction of the     for developing countries. came from Irving and the economics people.&#13;
&#13;
departaent. worry about the recruitment of the senior staff. work with             and it had an impact on the Bank as a whole.      The attempt to increase&#13;
&#13;
the divisiona on the prograas and projects. devote myself to                       the size of IDA tremendously came out of discussions between Irving and&#13;
&#13;
relationships with the rest of the Bank and with Irving.              As for the   George Woods. and while George Woods did not succeed in lifting the&#13;
&#13;
inner administration of the         depa~ent.    I would have a deputy to do it.   level of IDA to what he had wanted to. there is no doubt in my mind&#13;
&#13;
For awhile. I was doing the kind of administrative detail I can force              that what he succeeded in doing was to change the limits within which&#13;
&#13;
myself to do. but it is not something I like to do for a long period of            people thought of IDA.     Until George Woods' time. they thought in terms&#13;
&#13;
time.     HÂ¥   idea was to get a deputy to do it.       That is the role of a      of resources for IDA of $150 million to $300 million a year. something&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     7                                                                                  8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
like that.     The idea of thinking in terms of billions of dollars a year             the rest of the Bank hierarchy felt that this was somewhat&#13;
&#13;
came from George Woods, and when it first came forth. it was regarded                  inappropriate.     If you look at that Annual Report and then at the next&#13;
&#13;
with horror -     this -.ount of money flowing from a aul t.ilateral agency            Bank Report. you will find that the economic section is banished to a&#13;
&#13;
of this kind.     But, as a result, over the years, IDA did become a                   separate section.     It is not the principal section. it is almost an&#13;
&#13;
multi-billion dollar agency.        This came out of the Woods era.         Irving     addendum.     It is almost as though it were a report of a separate&#13;
&#13;
had a big role in that, and that is over and beyond what the economic                  institution.     It took two or three years before the Bank as a whole&#13;
&#13;
complex had to do.                                                                     accepted the fact that there should be an economic section.              Included&#13;
&#13;

KAMARCK:     Wait, there is one aore thing 1 should say, which I did not               statistics which were of value to economic development.              This was one&#13;
&#13;
mention yesterday and which occurred to ae later.               There was a very       of the very first things that the Economics Department did.&#13;
&#13;
important decision taken early on in the Econaaics Department.               Shortly   OLIVER:     This was sort of an incipient World Development Report which&#13;
&#13;
after I caae back from UCLA, George Woods bad lunch with Irving and me.                came much later.&#13;
&#13;
What he wanted to know is when we would be able to do an economic                      KAMARQ{:     Much later.&#13;
&#13;
section in the    ~       Report.    ~      Annual Report was a purely                 OLIVER:      Really the beginning.&#13;
&#13;
operations document.      It told about the number of loans. to what                   KAMARCK:     Very much the beginning.       That's right.   We had to educate&#13;
&#13;
countries.     There was practically nothing economic in it. and George                the Executive Directors and the Senior Staff that the World Bank had a&#13;
&#13;
Woods thought there should be        economics.      Here you have the leading         view and should have a view -- which it made public so the world would&#13;

without any economics in it. without any review of the state of                        OLIVER:     That is very interesting.       Well. let us now go on and talk&#13;
&#13;
development in the world; a review of the resources we were going to                   more generally about the years       1   63 to '68. the Woods years in the World&#13;

develop without a review of the major problems in this field.               He         Bank.     You talked a bit in passing about the IDA replenishment and the&#13;

thought that saaething should be done about this. so he asked us how                   importance of raising the sights of the world on concessional type&#13;

soon we felt we could do it.        I put   my   neck out and said. ''This coming      lending.     What other major events or achievements of these years come&#13;
&#13;
time. 11   And we did.   It really took a hell of a lot of hard work. but              to mind?&#13;
&#13;
we got an economics section into the         ~        Report.    As was typical.       KAMARCK:    Oh boy.   This is something that I really need notice of.          One&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          9                                                                            10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of the most important developments of the Woods period &amp;teRmed in part      KAMARa&lt;:     I don't know where it came from.   It may have been something&#13;
&#13;
froa the aaae point of view which I just mentioned in terms of the          that was just evolving.     I do recall that. in that period. there was&#13;
&#13;
Annual Report:   the World Bank should consider itself the leading          even one country that organized a consultative group on its own.        It&#13;
&#13;
economic development institution which had taken. and should take. a        set up a meeting. and it invited all of the agencies to come to the&#13;
&#13;
position of leadership.    One way this was trananitted by the World Bank   aeeting.     It was an idea whose time bad come. but Woods put the Bank&#13;
&#13;
was by beginning to organize consultative groups and by multiplying         into the leadership of it.&#13;
&#13;
consultative groups.                                                             A very important initiative that came during the Woods period&#13;
&#13;
     What is a consultative group1 A consultative group is a group of       was the policy toward India.     The Bank with respect to India bad a&#13;
&#13;
financing agencies and governments that are interested in helping a         policy which was quite different from its policy toward other&#13;
&#13;
particular developing country. The idea was that if a developing            countries.    Now I am talking as an outsider. because I was never&#13;
&#13;
country bad investment needs, the World Batik would aak.e a study â&#128;¢ a       involved in the policy in India. but everytime we had a discussion in&#13;
&#13;
survey of that country and have conversations with that country to          the Economic Committee. or I talked to anybody who had been on a&#13;
&#13;
diagnosis what the position was and what the country could do and           mission to India. the impression that I got was basically that. unlike&#13;
&#13;
should be doing by way of econoaic development. One of the things that      the sort of thing that we bad done in Australia or that we were doing&#13;
&#13;
would come out would be an estimate as to how auch the    count~   needed   in other developing countries. the mission would go to India. the&#13;
&#13;
over the next few years.    Then you would have this consultative group.    Indians would more or less tell them what they wanted the mission to&#13;
&#13;
which would be chaired by the Bank. of all the sources of finance that      hear. and the mission would come back reporting for the Indian&#13;
&#13;
were interested in helping this country.    At that meeting. the Bank       government.    There was very little. as far as I could see. really. of&#13;
&#13;
would present its analysis of the country and would wind up                 objective analysis and criticism of Indian policies.&#13;
&#13;
recommending that so much assistance be granted on such and such     te~s        George Woods changed that with the attitude that India was our&#13;
&#13;
-- some hard loans, soae soft loans. a blend and so on.    This was an      biggest problem.    A lot of resources were going into India. and we&#13;
&#13;
attempt. first. to provide leadership; second. to mobilize finance;         ought to see what could be done to improve the situation.       The details&#13;
&#13;
third. to encourage countries to improve their economic performance.        you should get from Bernie Bell.     There was an attempt to do sector&#13;
&#13;
This was a very big thing that Woods put a lot of effort into.              studies. one after another. very thorough sector studies. I think the&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Was this his personal idea. would you guess?                      coal study took over a year.    There was an agriculture study and a&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              11                                                                       12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
power study: they really tried to get on top of each sector. what           changed their agriculture policy. and the result is that now Indian&#13;
&#13;
needed to be improved.    The moat i.aportant of these was agriculture      agriculture is regarded as one of the successes.&#13;
&#13;
policy and the policy in aanufacturing.    The Bank put on a lot of              The other thing that the Bank tried to do was to change the policy&#13;
&#13;
pressure as a result of these studies to induce the Indian government       in India in manufacturing.   In manufacturing. the Indians had this&#13;
&#13;
to change their agricultural policies      their agricultural price         policy of investment in heavy industry.   Other industries were kept on&#13;
&#13;
policies. and their agriculture research and tax policies -- to improve     very strict controls. controls on the allocation of foreign exchange&#13;
&#13;
output.   The impression that I got -- I don't know if this is true --      for imports and machinery. controls on the opening of new enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
is that the Indian goveraaent up to this point had not been interested      controls on allowing private enterprises to compete with the government&#13;
&#13;
in improving agriculture output at all.                                     enterprises or even just keeping the private enterprises out in areas&#13;
&#13;
     The U. S. was giving Public Law 480 wheat and to same extent rice      where government enterprises couldn't enter.   The Indians were&#13;
&#13;
which was coming in and being sold for local currency.    This provided     convinced that it was iapossible to export manufactures. so they&#13;
&#13;
the local resources that the Indian governaent could then use to            refused to consider changing their exchange rate so as to make it&#13;
&#13;
finance heavy industry.    If you iaprove agriculture output. it meant      possible.&#13;
&#13;
that you wouldn't have PL 480 grain coming in and you wouldn't get the           The Bank under Woods put pressure on India.     Woods had a carrot&#13;
&#13;
local currency.   Froa their point of view. holding agriculture output      and a whip:   if they changed their policy. the Bank was going to try to&#13;
&#13;
down aade it possible for them to carry out the very stupid policy          provide more resources and to mobilize more resources for them.     The&#13;
&#13;
they had in those days of building up heavy industry on the model of        policy was only partially successful. because the Indians did not do as&#13;
&#13;
the first Russian five-year plan.                                           much as they were supposed to do. and the Bank didn't do as much as it&#13;
&#13;
     Woods and the Bank tried to change this. and the Bank policy was       then hoped it would be able to do.   But there was a bit of a change.&#13;
&#13;
supported by the U. S. government.    Lyndon Johnson decided that instead   The Indians. of course. are doing much better now.    I don't think that&#13;
&#13;
of making PL480 wheat available freely to the Indians. he'd keep. what      the vast improvement in the Indian industrial policy. which is still&#13;
&#13;
he called. the Indians on a short tether. He would provide just enough      far from complete. the Bank can claim credit for.    I think that about&#13;
&#13;
wheat to prevent thea from building up resources. They would feel on        all you can say is that the Bank started to make this whole thing&#13;
&#13;
the verge of running out of food.    There was an   eno~ous    outcry in    somewhat respectable.   It is not the outstanding success the Bank had.&#13;
&#13;
India against LBJ and against the Bank, but. as a matter of fact. they      and could take credit for. in agriculture.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Before Woods. as I bad mentioned earlier. the cast of mind that       last global-type question, I wonder if you would say a word about wha't&#13;
&#13;
people bad was that international financing agencies and donors were          you think George Woods had in mind in the way of ambition for the Bank&#13;
&#13;
doing as â&#128;¢ucb as they could for the developing countries.       They were     when he came to the Bank and even more generally what sorts of&#13;
&#13;
financing all the good projects. Woods flipped that over.       One of the    qualities you think are important in a person to be a president of the&#13;
&#13;
things that he did was to say that. if what we are doing for these            Ba11k1&#13;
&#13;
countries is beins stopped by the scarcity of good projects. what can         KAMARCK:     The first question is very difficult to answer, because I&#13;
&#13;
we do to help these countries to produce more good projects?      What kind   don't really know what be thought he would like to accoaplish with the&#13;
&#13;
of help?     Shouldn't we get into technical assistance in helping them.      Bank.      He had the advantage of knowing a fair bit about the Bank, not&#13;
&#13;
You started building a whole policy within the Bank of helping these          only from Black, but also from having done one or two missions for the&#13;
&#13;
countries produce better projects.     This is where the PAO agreement        Bank as a consultant.      He also clearly bad an interest in the&#13;
&#13;
caae from -     then. later on. with UNESCO and WHO.                          developing countries. He had been offered at one time the post of head&#13;
&#13;
        The Bank started building missions abroad. missions that were more    of the U.S. AID Agency.      (It bad been withdrawn because of criticism of&#13;
&#13;
than representative aissions.     The big example is the one in Indonesia     his association with First Boston's role in TVA.)      So he clearly had&#13;
&#13;
where you have a aission that was set up with projects people helping         shown interest in the problems in the developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
the Indonesians prepare projects which would then be subaitted to the                  My own feeling is that since, in his investment banking days, he&#13;
&#13;
Bank.     This also fits in with Woods' policy of no longer keeping the U.    was a person primarily in the buying end, be was in the creative end of&#13;
&#13;
N. at aras length. of no longer trying to show that the Bank vas not          investment banking, the side of investment banking that tries to solve&#13;
&#13;
strictly speaking a U.N. agency.      In cooperation with the UNDP and the    problems for enterprises, rather than on the selling side where the&#13;
&#13;
use of UNDP funds to prepare projects, the Bank became willing to             investment bank bas created some securities and it is a question of&#13;

accept UNDP financing of project preparation with the Bank                    siaply peddling the securities.     The story about the Ringling Brothers&#13;

administering this preparation.     This kind of technical assistance         Circus indicates that he tried to do not only good business but also&#13;
&#13;
bloomed in the Woods period and fitted in with that kind of                   good social policy.      So I think this is probably what be had in mind.&#13;
&#13;
orientation.     I think those are the things that pop into my mind right              The only thing explicitly that I ever heard him say was that it&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER:    Well, this is a marvelous place to stop.    If I might ask one     up the economics staff and do economics work.      That was the only thing&#13;

I reaaaber his saying in the professional staff meeting when he came to             investment bankers initially rather than bankers fraa some other field.&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.     There aay have been other things that he said. but that is            I think in the long run the two investment bankers who were heads of&#13;
&#13;
the thing that I remaaber aost.                                                     the Bank for a period of time. Black and Woods, will be regarded as&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
KAMARCK:     Jive thought a bit about this. and of course one can't be              the Bank rather ezpected to be presented with proposals by prospective&#13;
terribly conclusive.          Black was an invest.ent banker and Woods was an       borrowers so that it could act more passively as a recipient of&#13;
&#13;
investment banker. and they brought an approach to the Bank which is                proposals almost like a commercial banker making funds available when&#13;
&#13;
best suited for the Bank -- from the point of view that the investment              creditworthiness was established.   The Bank later became an&#13;
&#13;
banker takes a long-teDt point of view.           He doesn't look at situations     organization which itself perceived it had to help its clients to find&#13;
&#13;
aonth to month.           He looks at situations over years. perhaps even over a    out what kinds of projects were appropriate and what kinds of fiscal&#13;
&#13;
generation.      An investaent banker deals with people.        An investllent      policies were appropriate.   That is. perhaps, more the sort of thing&#13;

banker thinks in teras of staff, not so auch the W&amp;Â¥ a aanufacturer                 that a buyer in the investment banking area might be concerned with.&#13;

&#13;
but of    eve~   tranaaction.      Eveeytbing an inves'tllent banker does is        running the Bank and they talked about the scarcity of good projects&#13;
&#13;
unique.     Very seldom do they repeat the saae thing over and over again.          setting the limit on what the Bank could lend. it was quite clear -- I&#13;
&#13;
     A comaercial banker. to soae extent. is like a manufacturer in                 think this came from the investment banking side -- that you didn't&#13;
&#13;
that be sees a multitude of separate and, on the whole. fairly small                accept a project necessarily in the form the client presented it to&#13;
&#13;
transactions compared to the whole.           Hy feeling is that the World Bank     you.   In the Reorganization of 1952 when the Projects Department and&#13;
&#13;
is much more investment banking than it is commercial banking,                      the area departments were set up, it was made very clear that one of&#13;
&#13;
certainly much more like investment banking than manufacturing or any               the reasons projects people were needed was so that, in looking at a&#13;
&#13;
other field that I can think of.           I think the U. S. government and the     project that was presented, they could help the country not only&#13;
&#13;
other governments were wise when they thought in tenRs of recruiting                evaluate but make sure it had a good project: they would work with a&#13;

was so dc.inant that even other induatrali.zed countries didn 1 t have all      exaaple. when Singapore was being threatened by the Japanese and the&#13;

that aucb to say.   The British felt right from the beginning that they         Australians were pulling back their divisions out of the Middle East to&#13;
&#13;
could contribute soaething. but aost of the others really didn't feel           defend Australia. the British government wanted the Australians to&#13;
&#13;
they had much to contribute.    They were willing to take U. S.                 divert one or two divisions to Singapore.          The Australians told the&#13;
&#13;
leaderahip without auch question.    That changed over the years.               British to go to hell.          In this particular case the Australians were&#13;
particularily during the Woods period, and Woods had a much more                right, because if a division had been diverted to Singapore. what would&#13;
&#13;
difficult tiae in that respect.                                                 have happened is what happened to the one of the British divisions:             it&#13;
&#13;
     The relationship between the industralized countries and the               landed in Singapore and marched straight into a Japanese prisoner of&#13;
&#13;
developing countries changed a good deal too.     The developing countries      war ca.p.&#13;
&#13;
were increasingly beginning to feel their oats. particularly in the                  This was the willingness to stand up to the British. almost&#13;
&#13;
United Nations. and the Woods years coincided with an outburst of               getting a joy of standing up to the British.          As the British influence&#13;
&#13;
independence in Africa.    There were something like 30. 40 or 50 new           declined. the Australians basically learned not to look to the British&#13;
&#13;
members. and the voting power in the u. N. shifted.     The developing          for protection any more.         They realized that their protector was the&#13;
&#13;
countries suddenly discovered that they could have huge majorities in           United States.          So to some extent they have shifted their attitude&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              19&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
today -- the attitude that they uaed to have of tweaking the British.&#13;
&#13;
Now they are tweaking the United States.&#13;
&#13;
     John Stone, when he stood up to Woods, becaae an enfant terrible.&#13;
&#13;
He is a ..all guy, so it really appliea that way too.       On the Board, to&#13;
&#13;
the eztent the Australian goverDDent knew what he was doing, it&#13;
&#13;
wouldn't have bothered the to show that     ~     Australians canâ&#128;¢ t ,&amp;!!&#13;
&#13;
pushed    ~Â·    Just because we have one-tenth the population of the&#13;
&#13;
United States, doesn't aean that the Americana can push us around.â&#128;¢           I&#13;
&#13;
tbiult that that was a aeparate ele.ent.&#13;
&#13;
     There may have been ataetbing personal in addition to that.           John&#13;
&#13;
Stone, whoa I knew frc:a the tiae he waa a:n assistant in the Treasuey,&#13;
&#13;
an Australian Treaaury Attacbl! in London, always had a       bit of a chip-&#13;
&#13;
on-the-shoulder attitude, like so many saall men h.we.        '"I may be&#13;
&#13;
small, but by God you better not overlook me or I will have to kick you&#13;
&#13;
in the shins: in fact I will kick you in the shins to aake sure that&#13;
&#13;
you don't look over me.â&#128;¢    There is a lot of that attitude in John&#13;
&#13;
Stone. and that may have also have been an iaportant factor.&#13;
&#13;
(LIVER:   I think we have gotten quite a bit on two tapes in these two&#13;
&#13;
days. and I thank you very much.     I'll look forward to another one when&#13;
&#13;
the proper time comes.     Thank you very much.&#13;
