                                                 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
The African continent is among the most vulnerable to climate change due to a combination of the&#13;
anticipated effects of climate change and to ongoing development challenges, high poverty levels,&#13;
and low adaptive-capacity. Among a wide array of possible impacts of climate change, Africa will&#13;
experience compounded stress on water resources that already face significant strain from&#13;
overexploitation and degradation, with drought stress exacerbated in drought-prone regions. The&#13;
Niger River Basin in West Africa is on the extreme end of the vulnerability scale. The Basin suffers&#13;
further from a large Adaptation Deficit - national and local governments are not equipped to&#13;
respond to ongoing climate-related events, much less escalated future events.&#13;
&#13;
The Niger Basin is an expansive region in West Africa that is home to more than 130 million people&#13;
throughout the nine countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Mali,&#13;
Niger, and Nigeria. The Niger River and its tributaries are a vital lifeline providing drinking water,&#13;
irrigation, aquaculture, energy, and transport to these nine riparian countries. Heavy reliance on&#13;
natural resources, combined with ongoing conflicts, and political instability make it one of the most&#13;
fragile river basins in Africa. Over 70% of the population lives in areas where food security depends&#13;
on unreliable rainfall and highly variable inter-annual and intra-annual river flows. Climate variability&#13;
has long been a challenge and an obstacle for development in the Basin.&#13;
&#13;
Climate change will compound these extreme events and raise further obstacles to the region â&#128;&#159;s&#13;
achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals related to water management, food security,&#13;
environmental sustainability, and health, among others. The impacts of climate change increase&#13;
the risk of natural disasters such as floods and droughts, degrade the biodiversity and ecosystems&#13;
associated with the river, and have consequences on every economic sector. These impacts have&#13;
a compounding effect that threatens food and energy security, economic development, and the&#13;
preservation of the ecosystems in the Niger Basin.&#13;
&#13;
Financial, technological and managerial capacity gaps in the Niger Basin increase the overall&#13;
challenge of managing the riverâ&#128;&#159;s variability and responding effectively to peoplesâ&#128;&#159; needs. In&#13;
addition, the absence of adequate infrastructure undermines countriesâ&#128;&#159; abilities to store water in&#13;
times of scarcity, control flooding, and provide stable and affordable energy. All of these factors&#13;
increase threats to food and energy security, economic development, health of the ecosystems,&#13;
and overall stability in the Basin.&#13;
&#13;
Yet despite these development challenges and high poverty levels â&#128;&#147; 6 of the 9 riparian countries&#13;
are considered Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and are among the twenty poorest in the world&#13;
â&#128;&#147; there are vast opportunities for improving livelihoods in the Basin and strengthening its overall&#13;
development. Two key elements bring hope to the region for addressing these challenges: (1) a&#13;
history of cooperation between the riparian countries of the Niger Basin; and (2) an exceptionally&#13;
high potential for sustainable development that includes resilience-building and strengthening of&#13;
adaptive capacity.&#13;
&#13;
The Niger Basin countries recognize that the shared nature of their water resources presents&#13;
an opportunity for a collaboration and coordination that will derive greater resilience-building&#13;
outcomes. The Investment Plan for the Strengthening of Resilience to Climate Change in the Niger&#13;
River Basin (abbreviated as Climate Resilience Investment Plan - CRIP) was prepared and will be&#13;
implemented by the Niger riparian countries and the Niger Basin Authority (NBA), one of the oldest&#13;
African intergovernmental agencies, created in 1964 in Niamey, Niger.&#13;
&#13;
In the spring of 2015, during a ministerial round table on the future of the Niger River, the nine&#13;
riparian countries agreed to launch an initiative directed at building a coherent ensemble of actions&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
and investments to strengthen the resilience to climate change in the Niger River Basin, with the&#13;
objective of mobilizing resources for climate-related development.&#13;
&#13;
The CRIP includes 246 actions that are divided in two packages: (1) the Knowledge Package and&#13;
(2) the Sectoral Investment Package. Actions were culled from the NBAâ&#128;&#159;s Operational Plan,&#13;
member countriesâ&#128;&#159; National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and N ational Adaptation&#13;
Plans (NAPs), as well as country proposals. These actions include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Knowledge Package                                                Sectoral Investment Package&#13;
Measures to enhance                      Measures targeting vulnerability to water stress&#13;
knowledge and strengthen&#13;

regional institutions of the Basin       revenues, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Full implementation of the plan is estimated to cost USD $3.11 billion. The plan will mobilize&#13;
funding from a wide array of sources, some of which have committed support early in the Planâ&#128;&#159;s&#13;
development process. Additional funds will be mobilized with the support of regional and&#13;
multilateral partners, such as the Niger Basin Authority (NBA), the African Development Bank&#13;
(AfDB), and the World Bank (WB). In practice, the CRIP will bring together adaptation measures&#13;
planned in the Niger River Basin and help to mobilize complementary adaptation financing,&#13;
including from specialized climate funds. All financing for the investment plan is aligned and&#13;
consistent with existing plans at the regional and national levels.&#13;
&#13;
The CRIP integrates fully with the NBAâ&#128;&#159;s Operational Plan that structures the implementation of th e&#13;
Overall Development Plan of the Niger River Basin. Activities in the CRIP are programmed based&#13;
on the level of urgency expressed by the countries and the level of preparedness of these&#13;
activities. Each investment included in the Plan was examined and vetted by the Member States&#13;
through a comprehensive consultative process with multi-sectoral participation, strategically&#13;
coupled with exercises to build local capacity.&#13;
&#13;
This comprehensive basin-approach to addressing development and resilience is widely&#13;
considered a best practice, but rarely implemented in the developing world due to the urgency of&#13;
development needs as well as resource and capacity constraints. Yet in light of the rapidly&#13;
advancing effects of climate change and the certain devastation that these impacts will bring to the&#13;
most vulnerable countries and communities in the world, the CRIP is a bold and necessary step&#13;
toward concerted action for a sustainable future in the Niger Basin.&#13;

&#13;
        â&#128;&#156;In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems&#13;
        on all continents and across the oceans. Impacts are due to observed climate change,&#13;
        irrespective of its cause, indicating the sensitivity of natural and human systems to changing&#13;
        climate. â&#128;&#156;&#13;
                                                     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#13;
                                                       th&#13;
                                                     5 Assessment Report (2013)&#13;
&#13;
Between 2013 and 2014 the leading global consortium of scientists known as the&#13;
                                                                             th&#13;
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released their 5 Assessment Report&#13;
confirming the onset of climate change. They proved what many small farmers, native tribes, and&#13;
laypeople were already noticing in their surrounding environment. More startlingly in the IPCC&#13;
report â&#128;&#147; known for its conservative approach to climate scenarios â&#128;&#147; was the affirmation that&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long -lasting changes in&#13;
all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and&#13;
irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.â&#128;&#157; In other words, mitigation of greenhouse gases,&#13;
regardless of its level of ambition and pervasiveness, can no longer deter the inevitable impacts of&#13;
an already changing climate. Countries worldwide must prepare for these impacts and adapt to the&#13;
changes to come.&#13;
&#13;
The African continent is among the most vulnerable to climate change due to a combination of the&#13;
anticipated effects of climate change and to ongoing development challenges, high poverty levels,&#13;
and low adaptive-capacity. Among a wide array of possible impacts of climate change, Africa will&#13;
experience compounded stress on water resources that already face significant strain from&#13;
overexploitation and degradation, with drought stress exacerbated in drought-prone regions. Water&#13;
resource scarcity is directly linked to potential increased human security risks, violent conflict, and&#13;
migrations, which are among the most disquieting potential consequences of climate change for&#13;
the African continent. The IPCC warns that increased migration could lead to human suffering,&#13;
human rights violations, political instability and conflict. These are all dangers that African&#13;
countries must avoid in order to protect their societies and to continue progressing in their&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
The Niger River Basin in West Africa is on the extreme end of the vulnerability scale, especially to&#13;
impacts on water resources and coastal zones. The Basin suffers further from a large Adaptation&#13;
Deficit - national and local governments are not equipped or prepared to respond to ongoing&#13;
climate-related events, much less escalated future events. This deficit is directly related to the&#13;
level of development and capacity in the region â&#128;&#147; 6 of the 9 riparian countries are Least Developed&#13;
Countries â&#128;&#147; as well as political and security challenges that are pervasive throughout the Basin.&#13;
These issues take the forefront of government agendas and financial planning, demanding what&#13;
limited resources there are and leaving countries in a compromised position to begin addressing&#13;
climate change. While the knowledge and financing requirements for climate adaptation in the&#13;
Basin are high, the abilitity to attend to these needs are beyond their reach. What this means in&#13;
practical terms for these countries is that they have a much longer, more costly road to travel to&#13;
secure the future safety and well-being of their people. Intensified efforts to increase adaptation&#13;
can reduce risks and impacts, but under current circumstances only to a limited extent. What is&#13;
clear is that the region needs to find a way to continue their sustainable development while also&#13;
adapting to climate change â&#128;&#147; effectively, the Niger riparian countries need a climate resilience-&#13;
building approach to development.&#13;
&#13;
Understanding the importance and urgency of increasing their ability to address climate change,&#13;
and further recognizing the increased benefit of regional cooperation to strengthen these efforts,&#13;
the Niger Basin countries have undertaken to prepare a regional approach to building climate&#13;
resilience while continuing development efforts.&#13;

Investment plan for the Strengthening of Resilience to Climate Change in the Niger Basin&#13;
&amp;#12;Preamble                                                                                                                                                     4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In a bold effort to tackle the onset of climate change with ambition and courage, the nine riparian&#13;
countries of the Niger Basin â&#128;&#147; Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Mali,&#13;
Niger, and Nigeria â&#128;&#147; developed and adopted the Niger Basin Climate Resilience Investment Plan&#13;
(CRIP). Collectively they pledged to advocate for technical support and financing to implement its&#13;
246 resilience-focused priority actions and quickly put into motion its components. The Plan builds&#13;
on a history of strong riparian cooperation in the Niger Basin and represents an important&#13;
opportunity to take a coordinated approach in building regional climate resilience.&#13;
&#13;
After the ministerial round table on the future of the Niger River, held on 19th April, 2015 in&#13;
Washington, D.C., during the Spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary&#13;
Fund, participants agreed to launch an initiative aiming to constitute a coherent set of measures&#13;
and concrete investments that directly contribute to strengthening climate resilience in the Niger&#13;
Basin. With the support of BRLingenierie consultants, this initiative led to the development of the&#13;
Investment Plan for the Strengthening of the Resilience to Climate Change of the Niger Basin&#13;
(abbreviated to Climate Resilience Investment Plan - CRIP), which will be presented to the&#13;
international community during the 21st session of the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties in Paris&#13;
in December 2015 (COP 21). In view of the funding needs of the basin in terms of strengthening&#13;
the resilience to climate change, this initiative is also a means of harmonizing the adaptation&#13;
programmes planned in the Niger River Basin (NB) and mobilising the sources of climate funding.&#13;
&#13;
This document constitutes a consolidated version of the CRIP. It incorporates the contributions and&#13;
suggestions transmitted by the Member States during the national consultative workshops held in&#13;
August 2015, during the civil society regional consultative workshop (NGO, Regional Coordination&#13;
of Users, National Coordinations of Users) held on 12 September 2015 at Cotonou, Benin and&#13;
during the Extraordinary Session of NBA Council Ministers, held on 29 and 30 September 2015 at&#13;
Cotonou, Benin.&#13;
&#13;
The CRIP consists of a selection of measures contributing to strengthening the resilience to climate&#13;
change in the Niger Basin, identified in the following existing plans and programmes, and&#13;
subsequently validated by a consultation process with the countries:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Ten-year Operational Plan of the Niger Basin Authority (NBA), based on the contributions of the&#13;
   Member States and in line with the Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP) for the Niger&#13;
   Basin and its Investment Programme. For its implementation, the Operational Plan draws on&#13;
   the Integrated Programme for Agricultural Development and Adaptation to Climate Change&#13;
   (PIDAACC, an NBA/ADB project), the measures of which have been incorporated into the&#13;
   CRIP;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA) and National Adaptation Plans (NAP) of the&#13;
   Member States;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Other national or regional programmes for adaptation to climate change and contributions of the&#13;
   States.&#13;
&#13;
Particular attention has been paid to the consistency and compatibility of the CRIP with the various&#13;
national initiatives (Intended Nationally Determined Contribution - INDC) and regional initiatives&#13;
(economic communities, basin organisations) in order to facilitate the subsequent implementation&#13;
of these initiatives at national level by the countries.&#13;
&#13;
This document was presented during the meeting of the Finance Ministers of NBA Member States&#13;
that took place in Lima (Peru) on 7 October, 2015 as part of the annual World Bank and IMF&#13;
meetings.&#13;

1. VULNERABILITY OF THE NIGER BASIN TO CLIMATE&#13;
   RISKS&#13;
1.1            MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NIGER BASIN&#13;
The Niger Basin covers an area of over 2.2 million kmÂ², including approximately 1.5 million kmÂ² of&#13;
hydrologically active basin spread across 9 countries - Guinea, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Mali, Burkina Faso,&#13;
Niger, Benin, Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria1. Its geographical coverage, composed of vast desert&#13;
areas, is characterised by the presence of wide valleys, flood plains and areas of swamp (NBA,&#13;
2007).&#13;
&#13;
The basinâ&#128;&#159;s population of 130 million is expanding very rapidly and is projected to possibly surpass&#13;
180 million inhabitants by 2025 (NBA, 2007). Living conditions are threatened by the extremely&#13;
variable flow of the Niger River. A long period of low water levels (the annual flow at Bamako&#13;
between1970-2005 was over 30% less than that between 1905-1970), linked to falling rainfall, was&#13;
followed by a period of higher water levels. This led to flooding which caused significant damage in&#13;
the basin (particularly in 2013 and 2014). Most of the population and the economy of the countries&#13;
in the Niger Basin rely on agriculture, pastoralism or other means of subsistence based on natural&#13;
resources, and is directly dependent on the water resources of the Niger River or its tributaries.&#13;
Fair distribution of the water resources and the preservation of the aquatic ecosystems in the basin,&#13;
including the remarkable wetlands of the Inner Delta and the maritime delta, are thus two of the&#13;
greatest challenges faced by the riparian countries of the Niger River and its tributaries.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
1.2     EXTREME VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE RISKS&#13;
&#13;
AN EXTREMELY VULNERABLE REGION&#13;
&#13;
The Niger Basin (NB) is a region considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#13;
(IPCC) to have one of the highest vulnerabilities to the negative impacts/adverse effects of&#13;
climate change in the world. The main vulnerability factors in the basin are as follows:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; 6 out of the 9 Member States are ranked among the Least Developed Countries by the United&#13;
   Nations (Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Chad). Their Gross National Product per&#13;
   capita, their Human Capital Index and their Economic Vulnerability Index are among the least&#13;
   favourable. A large section of their populations is vulnerable, as characterized by high mortality,&#13;
   high malnutrition, low levels of education, and little access to clean drinking water and energy;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Populations with natural resources-dependent livelihoods that are highly sensitive to climatic&#13;
  variations;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Frequent droughts which have had a negative impact on the natural resources;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Continuous degradation of the forest resources, mainly for firewood to satisfy the energy needs&#13;
  of the population;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; High average rate of population growth of around 3% annual growth on average across the&#13;
  basinâ&#128;&#159;s populated zones, which puts strong pressure on the natural resources and the&#13;
  environment;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Fragile institutions;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Security problems and displaced populations in the region, particularly in Mali, Niger, Chad,&#13;
  Cameroon, Nigeria, etc.) The impacts of climate change and recurrent natural disasters also&#13;
  lead to mass migration in the region.&#13;
These vulnerability factors are also to be found in other regions of the world but the combination of&#13;
all these factors in the same region is very rare and results in considerably complicating the&#13;
situation. As a consequence, the NB is exceptionally vulnerable to climate risks (see Figure 1-&#13;
2)&#13;

&amp;#12;1. Vulnerability of the Niger Basin to climate risks                                                                                  9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GREAT UNCERTAINTY WITH REGARD TO CLIMATE RISK&#13;
&#13;
Assessment of the climate risks in the Niger Basin carried out by the Niger Basin Authority (NBA)&#13;
and the World Bank in 2013 on the one hand and the Member States as part of their preparation of&#13;
the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA) on the other indicate that inter-annual and&#13;
intra-annual climatic variations are naturally high in the basin.&#13;
&#13;
With regard to climate change, these studies highlight the uncertainty of climate projections for&#13;
the NB. Nevertheless, they do identify three broad trends with regard to climate change:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; An overall rise in temperature of 1Â°C to 3Â°C, and consequently an increase in&#13;
  evapotranspiration;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; A rise in sea-level in the maritime delta;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Increased variability of rainfall and the extreme weather events associated with this such as&#13;
   flooding and drought).&#13;
&#13;
The impact of climate change on the average annual rainfall remains uncertain however, with some&#13;
climatic models suggesting a decrease and others an increase (see Appendix C).&#13;
&#13;
The significant level of uncertainty in climatic projections makes it very difficult to assess the&#13;
impacts of climate change on the water cycle in the Niger Basin, requiring consideration of an&#13;
increase in both the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as flooding or severe&#13;
drought, and a rise or fall in the average values of climate and hydrological parameters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MULTIPLE SECTORAL IMPACTS&#13;
&#13;
The impacts of climate change on the water cycle increase the risk of natural disasters such as&#13;
floods and droughts, degrade the biodiversity and ecosystems associated with the river, and have&#13;
consequences on every economic sector - agriculture, livestock, fishing, hydroelectricity,&#13;
navigation, health, etc. â&#128;&#147; via the following pathways:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Change in availability of the water resources impacts the agricultural yields, animal&#13;
  production and hydroelectric power capability.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Modification of the flow regime of the river and its tributaries , including increased siltation,&#13;
  has a damaging effect on the navigability of the river, increases the risk of flooding and impacts&#13;
  the safety and security of the issues at stake, degrades the soil and destabilises the&#13;
  ecosystems along the river;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Changing quality of the water affects the cost of producing clean drinking water, facilitates the&#13;
  circulation of water-borne diseases, modifies the habitats of the aquatic ecosystems and thus&#13;
  affects fish production.&#13;
&#13;
These impacts have a compounding effect that threatens food and energy security, economic&#13;
development, and the preservation of the ecosystems in the Niger Basin.&#13;
&#13;
See detailed description of the sectoral impacts in the flowcharts included in Appendix D.&#13;
&#13;
In response to climate change, the main levers for action to protect, manage and develop the water&#13;
resources of the Niger River include the development of storage infrastructures and improved&#13;
water usage efficiency, the fight to protect the remarkable ecosystems of the basin against&#13;
degradation, improvement of the resilience of the populations and the strengthening of regional co-&#13;
operation (World Bank, 2012).&#13;

2.1      CRIP DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
ORIGIN OF THE INITIATIVE&#13;
&#13;
The demographic challenges of the Niger Basin and the resulting increase in water and energy&#13;
requirements, the threat of the cycle of droughts which began at the start of the 1970's continuing,&#13;
and the environmental issues faced by the basin have led the Member States to make a strong&#13;
commitment, in the context of the NBA, in the "Shared Vision" process, which in 2007 resulted in&#13;
the formulation of the Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP) and subsequently its&#13;
transformation in 2008 into an Investment Plan (IP). After a first phase of implementation of the IP&#13;
in the form of a priority five-year plan (2008-2012), the Member States furthered their commitment&#13;
to regional co-operation through a second phase of the implementation of the SDAP/IP by giving&#13;
the NBA a Strategic Plan (2013-2022) and a ten-year Operational Plan (2016-2024).&#13;
&#13;
Aware of their vulnerability with regard to climate change, the Member States emphasized their&#13;
willingness to adopt a coherent approach to tackling climate related challenges during the&#13;
ministerial round table on the future of the Niger River, held on 19th April, 2015 in Washington,&#13;
D.C. during the Spring Meetings of the World Bank and the IMF, the participants agreed to launch&#13;
an initiative aiming to constitute a coherent set of measures and concrete investments to&#13;
strengthen resilience to climate change in the Niger Basin.&#13;
&#13;
This initiative has resulted in the development of an Investment Plan for the Strengthening of&#13;
Resilience to Climate Change in the Niger Basin - abbreviated to Climate Resilience Investment&#13;
Plan - "CRIP" - based on existing key planning documents for the Niger Basin. The CRIP is a&#13;
short/medium term initiative (5 to 10 years) and aims to highlight a group of measures that can be&#13;
implemented rapidly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A CONSULTATIVE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS BASED ON THE EXISTING PLANNING&#13;
DOCUMENTS&#13;
&#13;
The existing planning documents used for its development include mainly:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The Operational Plan 2016-2024 (currently being finalised). This follows on from the Strategic&#13;
  Plan (2012) and aims to continue the implementation of the measures of the SDAP and its&#13;
  revised Investment Programme. It includes the 256 priority measures directly identified by the&#13;
  Member States during the implementation process conducted from 2013 to 2015 (see details of&#13;
  the way the NBA planning documents have developed in Appendix B). This includes the&#13;
  measures driven by the various projects of the NBA and its technical and financial partners&#13;
  (PIDAACC/ADB, P-DREDGE/WB, PGBFN/WB, P-GIRE2/AFD, etc.);&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA) and the National Adaptation Plans&#13;
  (NAP) developed by 6 of the 9 Member States 2 with the support of the UNFCCC and the&#13;
  UNDP from 2006 to 2010. For the other Member States, equivalent documents (e.g. NAPCC in&#13;
  Cameroon) or national subscriptions were used;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The contributions put forward by the Member States during the national consultations&#13;
  conducted in August 2015 and during a Regional Workshop held on 12 September, 2015 at&#13;
  Cotonou, for the preparation of this document.&#13;
&#13;
2 Cameroon, CÃ´te dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Nigeria have not officially submitted an NAPA to the UNFCCC.&#13;

The consultation process conducted with the Member States through their NBA National Focal&#13;
Structure, their CRIP focal point and their COP21 focal point, representatives of the civil society&#13;
(IUCN, Wetlands International, Regional Coordination of Users, National Coordination of Users),&#13;
regional organisations, and donors, ensures that local, national and regional stakeholders adopt&#13;
the CRIP initiative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A PLAN FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE&#13;
&#13;
The Climate Resilience Investment Plan thus consists of a selection of measures resulting&#13;
from these documents and contributing to strengthening resilience 3 of the populations in&#13;
the Niger Basin to climate change.&#13;
&#13;
Strengthening resilience to climate change of the populations, ecosystems, infrastructures and&#13;
institutions of the Niger Basin consists in reducing their exposure, reducing their sensitivity&#13;
and strengthening their adaptive capacity to the climate risks specific to the Niger Basin (see&#13;
Figure A-1) according to an overall development path where climate change is one of the major&#13;
constraints.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                               3                       3&#13;
The CRIP thus includes mainly measures for adaptation , and also measures for mitigation&#13;
as collateral benefits resulting from the adaptation measures, thereby representing win-win&#13;
                     3               3                              3&#13;
measures. No-regret and low-regret measures and flexible adaptation are also included in the&#13;
CRIP.&#13;
&#13;
For example, some agricultural, agroforestry or forest restoration and management measures not&#13;
only make it possible to enhance the resilience of the populations to climate change, but also&#13;
constitute mitigation measures by carbon sequestration in the plant biomass or in the soils, which&#13;
they foster. In the same way, the construction of a multi-purpose dam is deemed to be an&#13;
adaptation measure as the dam contributes to improving the availability of the water resource&#13;
during low-water periods, the protection against flooding and the improvement of the means of&#13;
subsistence of the local populations (fishing, tourism). The hydroelectric component of the dam&#13;
also constitutes a mitigation measure, contributing to energy generation without the emission of&#13;
greenhouse gas (GHG).&#13;
&#13;
Particular attention is paid to the integration of the measures of the CRIP on a larger scale, over a&#13;
longer time-frame and under contrasting hypotheses for the future changes, and also to the&#13;
consideration of interactions between sectors and between funding in order to avoid any risk of&#13;
                 3&#13;
maladaptation. Some measures aiming to reduce vulnerability to climate change can thus have a&#13;
negative effect or even increase the vulnerability of other systems, sectors or social groups. For&#13;
example, the reservoirs of dams may evaporate large volumes of water. These volumes&#13;
evaporated into the atmosphere will not feed the usages for which they were intended downstream&#13;
and damage the water balance on the scale of the basin, which in turn increases the vulnerability of&#13;
users to droughts.&#13;
&#13;
The package of measures included in the CRIP targets the different entry points inherent to the&#13;
reduction of climate risk. It includes preventive measures - prevention of the negative effects of&#13;
climate change on the management of water resources, preparation - before the occurrence of the&#13;
climate contingency (e.g. improvement/development of stream flow or climate networks, early&#13;
warning systems), - reactionary measures during the contingency (e.g. secure the water supply&#13;
during drought / periods of severe low water levels), and measures to restore or repair after the&#13;
contingency (e.g. restoration of infrastructures). Moreover, all the sectors related to the&#13;
management of water resources will be incorporated.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Finally, the CRIP takes into account the extreme uncertainty which reigns over the future&#13;
climate in the Niger Basin. By remaining open to the future integration of measures yet&#13;
unidentified or which are not currently eligible, the CRIP maintains a degree of flexibility and&#13;
continues to adapt to the very diverse potential impacts foreseen in the Niger Basin.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CONSISTENCY WITH NATIONAL AND REGIONAL INITIATIVES&#13;
&#13;
The CRIP will be presented to the international community during the 21st session of the UNFCCC&#13;
Conference of the Parties in Paris in December 2015 (COP 21). In view of the funding of the needs&#13;
of the basin in terms of strengthening the resilience to climate change, this CRIP is also a means of&#13;
mobilising funding. The sources of funding identified are the funds financing adaptation such as the&#13;
Green Climate Fund, the Climate Investment Fund or the Adaptation Fund, and multilateral and&#13;
bilateral donors in countries with or without links to a climate initiative. In order to be able to call&#13;
upon these funds, the CRIP fulfils the conditions and criteria of each of them (see details in&#13;
Appendix I).&#13;
&#13;
The initiatives for the COP21 relating to the Niger River Basin are numerous, particularly in terms&#13;
of adaptation to climate change. The Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) of the&#13;
countries includes an adaptation part. The regional institutions (BOAD, ECOWAS, WAEMU,&#13;
ECCAS, CEMAC, or CILSS) each have initiatives for adaptation to climate change specific to the&#13;
water resource management sector. These take the form of interventions (e.g. setting up of the&#13;
Regional Water Observatory for West Africa for the CCRE (Water Resources Coordination Centre)&#13;
or the Irrigation in the Sahel initiative of the CILSS) or funding tools (e.g. the Fund for the Green&#13;
Economy in Central Africa (FEVAC) set up by the ECCAS). These strategic documents define&#13;
priority areas for intervention at national and regional level to enhance resilience to climate change.&#13;
The CRIP has thus been developed so that, on the one hand, the measures selected are&#13;
compatible and complementary to these initiatives and on the other hand to ensure they are&#13;
coherent at national and regional level.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, some countries in the NB also share other international basins, the management authorities&#13;
of which have also developed initiatives for the COP21 (VBA, LCBC, CICOS, OMVS). Particular&#13;
attention has been paid to ensuring the coherence of these initiatives in order to facilitate their&#13;
subsequent implementation at national level by the countries.&#13;

2.2            METHOD OF SELECTING THE MEASURES OF THE CRIP&#13;
2.2.1              Definition of the criteria for selection of the measures&#13;
2.2.1.1 Aims&#13;
The first aim is to define criteria that makes it possible to select from measures in the existing&#13;
planning documents (the OP, NAPA/NAPâ&#128;&#159;s and contributions of the Member States submitted&#13;
during consultations), those measures relevant to the protection, management and development of&#13;
the water resources in the basin which appear in the thematic field of action of the NBA and&#13;
contribute to strengthening the resilience of the populations, ecosystems, infrastructures and&#13;
institutions in the Niger Basin to the climate risks specific to that region. This involves laying down&#13;
criteria specific to water resources management projects in the Niger Basin.&#13;
&#13;
The second aim is to ensure the selection of measures which fall within the geographical area of&#13;
the basin, which are adopted by the countries and which display a level of preparation allowing&#13;
rapid implementation to be envisaged, in order to facilitate access to the sources of funding&#13;
identified.&#13;
&#13;
2.2.1.2 The selection criteria&#13;
Ten criteria have been defined. They are classed according to their nature as technical,&#13;
institutional, administrative or economic (Table 2-1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;14                      2. Framework of the Climate Resilience Investment Plan development strategy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A measure must fulfil both of the following conditions to be selected in the CRIP:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; It must contribute to strengthening resilience to climate change and thus fulfil at least&#13;
   one of the following 2 corresponding criteria. These two criteria correspond to the two&#13;
   main categories of adaptation measures identified:&#13;
         ï&#130;· Institutional measures, knowledge enhancement measures or capacity-building&#13;
           measures contributing to enhancing resilience to climate change (criterion 1).&#13;
           This category includes knowledge enhancement measures et measures for forecasting&#13;
           hydro-climatic hazards and their impacts on the water resources regime (sub-criterion&#13;
           1.1), measures contributing to the assessment of the vulnerability of populations,&#13;
           ecosystems, infrastructures and institutions in the NB, to communication, education and&#13;
           awareness-raising (sub-criterion 1.2) and measures contributing to enhancing the&#13;
           integration of climate change adaptation into the capabilities, bodies and management&#13;
           instruments of the national and regional institutions of the Basin (sub-criterion 1.3)&#13;
     ï&#130;·      Sector-specific measures contributing to strengthening resilience of the populations and&#13;
            ecosystems of the basin to the climate changes identified in the Niger Basin (criterion 2).&#13;
            All the flowcharts in appendix D are an integral part of the definition of technical criterion&#13;
            No.2. Any measure targeting one of the impacts identified in these flowcharts belongs to&#13;
            this category. This includes measures aiming to reduce vulnerability linked to water&#13;
            stress conditions, flooding, deterioration of the water quality, soil degradation,&#13;
            degradation of the grazing land, degradation of the ecosystems, or to the rising sea-level&#13;
            and measures aiming to strengthen resilience (e.g. generation of jobs, revenues, etc.)&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Moreover, it must satisfy all of the following criteria (3 to 10):&#13;
     ï&#130;·      contribute to the sustainable development and management of the Niger Basin (criterion&#13;
            3)&#13;
     ï&#130;·      avoid maladaptation (criterion 4) (see Appendix E)&#13;
     ï&#130;·      contribute to the protection, management and development of the water resources in the&#13;
            Niger Basin, as well as of the related ecosystems (criterion 5)&#13;
     ï&#130;·      be compatible with the planning documents and agreements concerning the Niger Basin&#13;
            (criterion 6)&#13;
     ï&#130;·      be well-adopted by the Member States (country ownership) (criterion 7)&#13;
     ï&#130;·      demonstrate the level of preparation required (criterion 8)&#13;
     ï&#130;·      pre-identified funding (criterion 9)&#13;
     ï&#130;·      economic feasibility (criterion 10)&#13;
&#13;
The detailed methodology for comparing projects with each of these criteria is provided in Appendix&#13;
E.&#13;
&#13;
The criteria subject to scoring (criteria 1, 2, and 8) will be used to prioritise the measures selected&#13;
in the CRIP.&#13;
&#13;
Criteria 9 and 10 focus more specifically on the funding of the measures:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Criterion 9 aims to assess the project funding conditions. The level of funding identified for each&#13;
  operation has been collected from the countries. Projects benefiting from signed financing&#13;
  agreements are not selected. This criterion allows the selection of measures for which funding&#13;
  has been identified for all or part of the budget but not confirmed, or for which no funding has&#13;
  been identified.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The feasibility of the measures (criterion 10) will be assessed at the time of their selection for&#13;
funding. This analysis will be conducted based on feasibility studies produced by the countries for&#13;
each measure, as part of their preparation. Measures for which no feasibility study has been&#13;
produced are selected in the CRIP with the aim of mobilizing funding in order to carry out these&#13;
feasibility studies. The associated target amount corresponds to a portion of the overall amount&#13;
indicated for these measures.&#13;

2.2.2              Justification of the measures selected&#13;
This section aims to provide the main justification concerning the selection or non-selection of the&#13;
measures with regard to their contribution to strengthening resilience to climate change. For this&#13;
purpose, the table shown below crosses the main types of sectoral activities (lines) with the&#13;
various types of adaptation measures (columns). The table also indicates the risks of&#13;
maladaptation linked to a decline in the water balance (second to last column) and the possibility&#13;
of co-beneficiaries in terms of mitigation (last column).&#13;
&#13;
For the record, the strategic focuses of the Strategic Plan and the Operational Plan to which the main&#13;
types of sectoral measures belong are reiterated.&#13;
&#13;
It should be noted that this table only concerns the contribution to strengthening resilience (criteria 1&#13;
and 2) and, in part, criterion 4 on the risks of maladaptation. The other criteria are considered&#13;
elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
The justification for each of the measures taken individually and for the other eight criteria are supplied&#13;
in Appendix E.&#13;
&#13;
It should be noted that the measures resulting from programmes for adaptation to climate change&#13;
(NAPA, NAPCC, PIDAACC, etc.) contribute de facto to strengthening the resilience to climate change.&#13;
However, assessment of the measures from the NAPA lies in the following questions:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Is their geographical area compatible with the geographical area of the Niger Basin? (criterion 3)&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Do they generate maladaptation? (criterion 4)&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Do they contribute to the protection, management and development of the water resources in the&#13;
  Niger Basin? (criterion 5)&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Are they compatible with the strategic documents concerning the Niger Basin? (criterion 6)&#13;

   STRENGTHEN CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN THE NIGER BASIN&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.1            PRESENTATION AND ARCHITECTURE&#13;
The CRIP consists of a selection of measures, chosen with regard to the first 9 criteria defined in&#13;
section 2.2.1. The selection will be narrowed down when the funding is mobilised by matching the&#13;
measures to the last criterion, concerning the economic feasibility of the projects (criterion 10).&#13;
Justification of their selection is described in detail in Appendix E.&#13;
&#13;
The CRIP is intended to be an upgradable document into which measures can be integrated in the&#13;
future, according to the same selection process.&#13;
&#13;
The ability of the institutions in the Niger Basin to address issues transcending sectors, such as&#13;
climate change, both at local and national level, and at the level of the Basin, is critical to the&#13;
achievement and robustness of the results expected by implementing the CRIP. For this reason,&#13;
the institutional measures for strengthening the capacity-building measures and the knowledge&#13;
strengthening measures have been isolated in a package of "Knowledge and Institutions"&#13;
measures. Its implementation is presented as a priority in order to guarantee that the second package&#13;
of measures in the CRIP will be fully effective.&#13;
&#13;
It should be noted that the measures of the Operational Plan included in the "Knowledge and&#13;
Institutions" package mainly concern the NBA. They are supplemented by measures targeting the&#13;
national and local institutions resulting from the NAPA/NAPâ&#128;&#159;s. Additional measures to strengthen the&#13;
Member States at national level may be identified during the consultations and possibly integrated in&#13;
order for the conditions for implementation of the measures in the second CRIP package to be met both&#13;
at regional and at national and local levels&#13;
&#13;
The CRIP mainly contains adaptation measures, and also mitigation measures as collateral benefits&#13;
resulting from the adaptation measures. It is thus organised as follows:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Package of Knowledge and Institutions measures&#13;
  1. Knowledge. Collection and generation of climatic and hydrological information. Weather-&#13;
     forecasting tools and decision-making tools&#13;
  2. Assessment of vulnerability. Communication education and awareness-raising&#13;
  3. Integration of climate change adaptation into the capabilities, bodies and management&#13;
     instruments of the national and regional institutions of the Basin&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Package of sectorial measures contributing to strengthening resilience of the populations&#13;
  and ecosystems of the basin to the impacts of climate change identified in the Niger Basin&#13;
  (criterion 1):&#13;
  4. Measures targeting vulnerability to water stress&#13;
  5. Measures targeting vulnerability to flooding&#13;
  6. Measures targeting vulnerability to soil degradation&#13;
  7. Measures targeting vulnerability to degradation of the grazing land&#13;
  8. Measures targeting vulnerability to degradation of the ecosystems&#13;
  9. Measures targeting vulnerability to deterioration of the water quality&#13;
  10. Measures targeting vulnerability linked to the rising sea-level&#13;
  11. Measures strengthening resilience (e.g. generation of jobs, revenues, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
In its current version (23 November 2015), The Investment plan for the Enhancement of Resilience to&#13;
Climate Change in the Niger Basin contains 246 measures, distributed as follows:&#13;

         etc.&#13;
&#13;
The following two tables set out the measures selected in the two packages in the CRIP, after&#13;
the selection process described in section 2. The measures are organized according to their nature&#13;
with regard to adaptation / resilience to climate change. The measures in the "Knowledge and&#13;
Institutions" package are those validating criterion No.1. The sub-categories corresponding to sub-&#13;
categories 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. The measures in the second package are those that fall under criterion&#13;
No.1. The sub-categories are also identical.&#13;
&#13;
It should be noted that certain measures may belong to several categories of adaptation measures. In&#13;
this case, they have been allocated to the category for which the contribution is the most significant. The&#13;
two columns on the right indicate the values of criteria No.2 (Contribution to resilience) and No.10&#13;
(Stage of preparation of the project). The meaning of the values taken by these two criteria is given in&#13;
Appendix E. These criteria may be used to prioritise measures.&#13;
&#13;
Some of the measures of the CRIP resulting from NAPA/NAPâ&#128;&#159;s or national contributions may concern&#13;
areas that are partially outside the Niger Basin, such as the national territory or administrative areas&#13;
(municipalities, regions, etc.). These measures are included in the CRIP in proportion to the portions of&#13;
the Basin concerned.&#13;
&#13;
All the detailed information (cost, values of the assessment criteria, etc.) about all the measures&#13;
analysed is given in Appendix E.&#13;
&#13;
A summary of the measures per country is also given in Appendix F.&#13;

3.3            CRIP EXPECTED RESULTS AND IMPACTS - MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
&#13;
EXPECTED RESULTS AND MONITORING OF IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
This plan recognizes the need for the NBA to develop a robust monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E)&#13;
program to support accountability and learning as it passes from its current design phase to the&#13;
implementation phase in the months ahead, Such a program will include : a results framework to&#13;
identify the intended impacts and outcomes of the plan as a whole and the individual&#13;
interventions (including the logical cause-and-effect relationship between the interventionsâ&#128;&#159; inputs&#13;
and activities and these results) ; and indicators to serve as progress markers toward the intended&#13;
results outlined in the results framework.&#13;
&#13;
First, NBA will work with countries and stakeholders to develop an agreed upon results framework&#13;
and the associated indicators. Below is a list of potential results indicators aiming at assessing&#13;
intended impacts and outcomes of the plan. The countries and the stakeholders could use it as&#13;
a starting point for ultimately settling on the most relevant aggregate indicators for each of the&#13;
selection criteria.&#13;

Outcome indicators could not be estimated at this stage, due to a lack of detailed information on&#13;
some of the CRIP actions. In order to have a first overview of the expected results and the&#13;
distribution of the CRIP actions at this stage of its development, the following maps (Figure 3-1)&#13;
were developed:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; They show the breakdown of sectoral interventions, from the Second Package, and the amount&#13;
  involved in the national portions of each sub-basin;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The map 3-1 concerns the actions to develop socio-economic infrastructure, from categories 4,&#13;
  5, 10 and 11. The ratio of the amount invested for the CRIP actions on the population size of&#13;
  each sub-region is proposed as a first approach of estimating the beneficiaries of the CRIP.&#13;
  This mapping highlights the wide distribution of investment throughout the basin and&#13;
  emphasizes the shared benefits of the CRIP;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The map 3-2 gathers the actions for the protection and conservation of ecosystems and the&#13;
  environment, from categories 6, 7, 8 and 9. The ratio of the amount invested for the CRIP&#13;
  actions on land area of each sub-region is proposed as a first approach of estimating the&#13;
  beneficiary impacts of the CRIP on the basin ecosystems. This mapping illustrates the&#13;
  distribution of financing by sub-basin and national areas, especially into places of low economic&#13;
  development rather than only to areas of higher population density, as is often the case;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The actions of the package "Knowledge and Institutions" refer to the entire basin and have not&#13;
  been shown;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The amounts correspond to the implementation and financing strategy, presented below,&#13;
  respectively in Sections 3.4 and 4.&#13;
&#13;
These maps highlight that the sectoral interventions of the CRIP do not just focus on traditional&#13;
economic growth areas, around major cities of the basin, as is often the case, but they will also&#13;
impact the most remote rural areas which directly suffer the impacts of climate change. The CRIP&#13;
will strengthen the resilience of the population to climate change by improving the shared&#13;
prosperity in the basin.&#13;

ASSESSMENT PROGRAMME&#13;
&#13;
Beyond this, however, the program will also include evaluation, which is a separate analysis that&#13;
draws upon the results framework and indicators, but also involves additional independent data&#13;
collection and analysis. Evaluation typically examines why and how results have been achieved,&#13;
what has worked well and not worked well, and what kind of improvements to design and&#13;
implementation could improve results. Including an impact evaluation mechanism in the&#13;
implementation of this plan improves the empirical understanding around approaches and practices&#13;
that are most successful at building resilience in the Niger Basin. Incorporating this evidence-base&#13;
into the Programâ&#128;&#159;s learning cycle will thus help NBA build the necessary capacity in the region&#13;
(both at national and local levels) for M&amp;E of climate resilience investments amongst the&#13;
stakeholders&#13;

&#13;
3.4            IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
3.4.1              Programmation&#13;
To insure consistency with the Operationnal Plan of the NBA, the CRIP has been integrated into&#13;
the 3-year plans 2016-2018, 2019-2021 and 2022-2024 aiming at implementing the OP. To do so,&#13;
NBA develped an implementation strategy that is detailed in Appendix J.&#13;
&#13;
This implementation strategy is based on the prioritization of the CRIP actions. The CRIP actions&#13;
were assigned to the 3-year plans according to the level of emergency, as precised by the&#13;
countries, to their contribution to resilience strengthening and to their readiness level (the two latter&#13;
parameters are detailed in the last 2 columns of the tables of actions in section 3.2). For instance,&#13;
the activities related to the PIDACC were assigned to the first 3-year plan.&#13;
&#13;
On this basis, the CRIP actions have been scheduled in coordination with the OP actions of NBA&#13;
(see Appendix H). This physical and financial scheduling is synthetized in the table shown in&#13;
section 4.2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.4.2              Gender equality&#13;
The need to address gender in adaptation to climate change is widely recognized. In many parts of&#13;
the world, women and men experience and respond to climate impacts differently. They are also&#13;
involved in climate change solutions in differing ways depending on their roles in society and in&#13;
their communities. Recognizing and integrating gender considerations in resilience-building is&#13;
paramount to ensuring effective outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
In the Niger Basin, women are primarily responsible for food production, household water supply,&#13;
energy production for heating and cooking, childcare, and sharing traditional knowledge. These&#13;
areas of daily life are complicated and even impaired by a rapidly and unpredictably changing&#13;
climate. In rural communities, women use and manage natural resources that also at risk to the&#13;
impacts of climate change. And yet, women often lack access to financial and technical support,&#13;
emergency response systems, and other support systems needed to cope with those impacts.&#13;
&#13;
Although they are disproportionately affected, women also play a crucial role in building resilience&#13;
to climate change. They have many crucial skills and relationships that are needed to adapt to&#13;
changing environmental realities. As the heart of their communities, they are often responsible for&#13;
knowledge dissemination, development of coping strategies, and implementation of community-&#13;
based solutions. Moreover, womenâ&#128;&#159;s knowledge, networks, and strategies to deal with climate&#13;
variability are best enabled and supported when women are represented in relevant decision-&#13;
making at all levels.&#13;
&#13;
The NBA and its member countries plan to implement CRIP activities in a gender informed way â&#128;&#147;&#13;
both to reduce vulnerability of women to the effects of climate change and to harness the unique&#13;
role and skills of women to build climate resilience. Countries foresee gender considerations&#13;
playing an important role in the design, decision-making, stakeholder engagement, and&#13;
implementation phases of relevant CRIP activities. Specifically, gender will be mainstreamed into&#13;
activities such as capacity building, communication, project formulation, studies, and assessment.&#13;
Notably, a number of country projects are specifically designed to strengthen womenâ&#128;&#159;s role in&#13;
adaptation measures related to water management and food production. One country will develop&#13;
their national gender policy by considering womenâ&#128;&#159;s vulnerability to climate change with support&#13;
from the CRIP, and the NBA will also develop its own gender policy in order to support coherent&#13;
implementation of all CRIP actions.&#13;

4. FUNDING OF THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE INVESTMENT&#13;
   PLAN&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.1     POSITIONING WITH REGARD TO OTHER ADAPTATION&#13;
        PROGRAMMES&#13;
&#13;
It does not compete with other national or regional investment programmes. It aims to&#13;
mobilise additional sources of investment, specific to adaptation to climate change, for the&#13;
implementation of measures taken from the OP, the NAPAs, the NAP â&#128;&#159;s and national contributions&#13;
to strengthening resilience to climate change in the Niger Basin. It incorporates the adaptation&#13;
measures of the various projects of the NBA (PIDAACC/ADB, P-DREDGE/WB, P-GIRE2/AFD,&#13;
etc).&#13;
&#13;
Moreover, the CRIP is consistent and compatible with the various national initiatives (INDC,&#13;
national adaptation plans in particular) and regional initiatives in connection with adaptation to&#13;
climate change.&#13;
&#13;
The CRIP is thus positioned as an investment plan encompassing/harmonizing all the&#13;
adaptation measures planned in the NB. Each of the projects of the NBA or the national or&#13;
regional action programmes included in the CRIP constitutes a lever for implementation of the&#13;
measures they drive. As such, being fully incorporated into the CRIP, the PIDAACC, an NBA&#13;
adaptation project supported by the ADB, has a central place. The ADB is thus a valued&#13;
partner of this initiative.&#13;
&#13;
The Integrated Programme for Agricultural Development and Adaptation to Climate Change in the&#13;
Niger Basin (PIDAACC/NB) aims to contribute to improving the life of the populations and their&#13;
resilience to the effects of climate change by the sustainable management of the natural resources.&#13;
Its preparation is funded by the African Development Bank (ADB) and follows on from the Silting&#13;
Control Programme in the Niger Basin (SCP/BN), co-funded by the ADB. It includes 38 measures,&#13;
distributed between 3 components: (i) Integrated Development of Water Resources, (ii)&#13;
Development of the Resilience of the Populations and Ecosystems and (ii) Coordination and&#13;
management of the Programme. The PIDAACC/BN will enable the Investment Programme (IP) to&#13;
be made operational and the implementation of the NBA Operational Plan (OP) by 2021, through&#13;
the measures it drives.&#13;
&#13;
4.2     COST OF THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE INVESTMENT PLAN&#13;
The overall amount of the Climate Resilience Investment Plan in its current version, i.e. a selection&#13;
of measures, based on the OP, NAPAs, NAPs and national contributions, screened using the first 8&#13;
criteria defined in section 2.2.1, is approximately 3,111,000,000 USD (3.11 billion USD). The costs&#13;
have been estimated based on the information contained in the description sheets for the projects&#13;
provided by the countries and the NBA. The tables below summarize the cost of the CRIP per type&#13;
of adaptation measure and per country.&#13;
&#13;
NB: It should be noted that some measures may belong to several categories of adaptation&#13;
measures. In this case, they have been allocated to the category for which the contribution is the&#13;
most significant. The figures given in the table below should therefore be interpreted in perspective.&#13;
For example, the multi-usage infrastructures adopted in the CRIP have been classed in category 4&#13;
"Vulnerability linked to water stress", which partly explains the high amount associated with this&#13;
category. However, these structures also significantly contribute to flood protection and therefore&#13;
also fall under category 5 but the amount of the activity has not been counted in this category.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Moreover, the Plan does not attempt to parce out incremental costs of adaptation activities. Rather,&#13;
it consders the full amount of each investment as its contribution to resilience-building in the Niger&#13;
Basin. It is recognized, though, that some financing mechanisms could request more nuanced&#13;
analyses of the additionality of adaptation costs to justify funding certain projects contained in the&#13;
Plan; something that the implementing partners will work to provide when required.&#13;

The CRIP does not constitute a fixed breakdown of resources between the countries. The total cost&#13;
per country reflects only the number of projects that were identified and considered consistent with&#13;
the resilience criteria defined in the CRIP. Actual financing of the plan will depend on the interest of&#13;
financing entities and specific country priorities.&#13;
&#13;
Financial scheduling of the CRIP based on the prioritization of the actions&#13;
&#13;
NBA developed a strategy to implement the CRIP, based on the prioritization of the actions (see&#13;
section 3.4) and on their breakdown in the three 3-year plans of the OP. This turns into a financial&#13;
programming of the CRIP actions. The programming of each CRIP action is detailed in the tables&#13;
presented in Appendices G and H, and summarized in the following synthesis table.&#13;

4.3            FUNDING PLAN&#13;
The CRIP aims to encompass and harmonize all the adaptation measures planned in the NB .&#13;
Each of the projects of the NBA or the national or regional action programmes included in the CRIP&#13;
and for which funding is identified constitutes a lever for implementation of the measures they&#13;
drive. The CRIP can therefore already draw on the projects and action programmes which are due&#13;
to be implemented imminently (e.g. PIDAACC).&#13;
&#13;
4.3.1              Current state of identified funding sources&#13;
On the scale of the overall CRIP document&#13;
&#13;
According to the information it has been possible to collect at the time of this report preparation,&#13;
618 million USD have already been identified, which represents 20% of the overall amount. The&#13;
financing sources identified for each of the measures are specified in the tables in section 3.2.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
With regard to the measures for which funding has not been identified, the World Bank and the&#13;
ADB have begun consultations with the Technical and Financial Partners to mobilize&#13;
supplementary resources for this initiative. The process is ongoing. A table summarising the&#13;
distribution of the commitments of the various donors and partners for the financing of the CRIP will&#13;
be drafted based on the interest and commitments expressed after the consultations.&#13;
&#13;
On the scale of each of the 3-year plans of the OP implementing the CRIP&#13;
&#13;
The following table illustrates the fundraising efforts that will be necessary to insure the&#13;
sustainability and efficiency of the CRIP. It shows the level of already identified funding and their&#13;
breakdown in the 3-year implementation plans.&#13;
&#13;
Moreover, the table presents the possible â&#128;&#147; yet to be confirmed â&#128;&#147; contribution of the countries to&#13;
the CRIP. It is assumed that this contribution would reach at least 10% of each action cost. This&#13;
contribution has been considered as identified funding (see fundraising strategy in the next&#13;
section). In addition, the direct beneficiaries will also be asked to contribute financially or in kind, to&#13;
the implementation of the actions that directly concern them, except for the most important&#13;
infrastructure. At the time of this report preparation, and based on this assupmtion, 28% of the&#13;
overall amount of the CRIP actions assigned to the first 3-year implementation plan is already&#13;
identified.&#13;

4.3.2      Fundraising strategy&#13;
The Investment Plan for the Strengthening of Resilience to Climate Change includes 246 actions&#13;
for a total amount of 3.11 billion USD. The identified financing represents about 20%. Thus, 80% of&#13;
the cost of the CRIP, which is 2.492 billion USD is still to be mobilized for its implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Targeted financing sources include:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Counterpart contributions of both NBA Member Countries and actionsâ&#128;&#159; beneficiaries;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Adaptation financing funds;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The Green Climate Fund;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; FEM;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Multilateral donors in link or not with a climate initiative (WB, AfDB, etc.);&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Bilateral donors in link or not with a climate initiative (EU, USAID, GIZ, KfW, FDA, BADEA, etc.);&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Regional financial institutions in link or not with a climate initiative (BOAD, WAEMU, CEMAC).&#13;

&amp;#12;4. Funding of the Climate Resilience Investment Plan                                                                                  51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The strategy for mobilizing the above-mentioned financing is set forth as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
FINANCIAL INVOLVEMENT OF NBA MEMBER COUNTRIES AND THE BENEFICIARIES&#13;
OF THE ACTIONS IN IMPLEMENTING THE CRIP&#13;
&#13;
NBA Member Countries, engaged in a shared vision for a sustainable development of the basin&#13;
since 2002, and acknowledging the big challenge which the strengthening of the resilience of&#13;
populations, infrastructures, ecosystems and institutions to climate change particularly represents,&#13;
own the CRIP.&#13;
&#13;
The collectively commit themselves to:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Embark on advocacy on the Investment Plan for the Strengthening of Resilience to Climate&#13;
  Change in the Niger Basin (CRIP) in order to mobilize Technical and Financial Partners;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Mobilize national counterpart contributions for financing the actions of the Investment Plan for&#13;
  the Strengthening of Resilience to Climate Change in the Niger Basin (CRIP) for up to 10% of&#13;
  the cost of the investments planned. For this, budgetary entries will be made as from the 2016&#13;
  fiscal year in Member Countriesâ&#128;&#159; respective budgets;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Finalize country and community consultations on the feasibility of innovative and sustainable&#13;
  financing mechanisms for which we have Decision No.5 of the 9th and 10th NBA Summits of&#13;
  Heads of State and Government on the implementation of the mechanisms for an autonomous&#13;
  and sustainable financing of NBA, with the involvement of the private sector;&#13;
&#13;
In order to ensure beneficiariesâ&#128;&#159; ownership of the realizations, and the sustainability of investments,&#13;
the direct beneficiaries of the CRIP actions will bring their counterpart contributions which vary&#13;
between 5% and 10% of the costs, depending on the actions; that percentage will be defined&#13;
during the financial programming of each action.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, the direct beneficiaries will also be asked to contribute financially or in kind, to the&#13;
implementation of the actions that directly concern them, except for the most important&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CONTRIBUTION OF THE DEVELOPMENT BANKS SUPPORTING THE CRIP (WB,&#13;
AFDB)&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The advocacy and sensitization of TFPs will be intensified before COP21 in order to mobilize&#13;
  them and to bring them to decide on the level of their involvement in the financing of the CRIP.&#13;
  For this, the World Bank, Lead Member of NBA TFPs, and the African Development Bank&#13;
  (AfDB), Lead Member of PIDACC/NB Partners, will support NBA and Member Countries in&#13;
  CRIP promotion and implementation.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; NBA and Member States will officially solicit the two Development Banks so that they announce&#13;
  their contribution by the COP21. This should create a domino effect for bringing other partners&#13;
  by concretely taking part in the financing of the CRIP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CONTRIBUTION OF OTHER TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL PARTNERS (TFPS)&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; NBA will send official requests about CRIP to every other TFPs and will invite them at the CRIP&#13;
  presentation at COP21;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The World Bank and NBA, with the support of a Champion, will intensify advocacy and&#13;
  sensitization towards partners before COP21 by visiting, if need be, their headquarters to&#13;
  ensure the successful presentation of CRIP to CoP21. The advocacy will continue during and&#13;
  after COP21;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; A meeting of PIDACC partners will be held in February 2016, with the support of AfDB/AWF and&#13;
  ICA, for mobilizing PIDACC financing, a priority program of the CRIP;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Regional programme sheets will be developed, in relation with Member Countries, for&#13;
  submission to donors and climate funds (GCF, FEM, etc).&#13;

ï&#130;&#132; A fundraising working group will be established and managed by NBA from January 2016 ;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; NBA, with the support of the World Bank and the African Development Bank, will establish a&#13;
  Fiduciary Fund for strengthening resilience to climate change in the Niger Basin, which will&#13;
  constitutes a sustainable funding tool;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; National and regional resilience programs/projects will be developed and implemented over the&#13;

&#13;
DEFINITION OF CLIMATE RISK&#13;
&#13;
Climate risk can be broken down into the climate hazard itself and the vulnerability of the system in&#13;
question (population, ecosystem, infrastructure, institution). See Figure A-1 below.&#13;
&#13;
Climate change: A change in climate conditions which can be characterised (e.g. using statistical&#13;
tests) by shifts in average and/or property variability modifications and which persist over a long&#13;
period of time, typically decades or more. Climate change can be a result of anything from natural&#13;
internal processes (natural variability) to external forces or persistent anthropogenic changes to the&#13;
composition of the atmosphere or how land is used.&#13;
&#13;
Vulnerability: Vulnerability to climate change is the degree to which geophysical, biological and&#13;
socio-economic systems are susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse impacts of climate&#13;
change (see ; FÃ¼ssel and Klein, 2006). The term â&#128;&#158;vulnerabilityâ&#128;&#159; may therefore refer to the vulnerable&#13;
system itself, e.g., low-lying islands or coastal cities; the impact to this system, e.g., flooding of&#13;
coastal cities and agricultural lands or forced migration; or the mechanism causing these impacts,&#13;
e.g., disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet.&#13;
&#13;
Exposure: The presence of people means of subsistence, resources and environmental services,&#13;
elements of infrastructure or economic, social or cultural assets in an area which is susceptible to&#13;
damage.&#13;
&#13;
Sensitivity: The degree to which a system is either positively or negatively influenced by climate&#13;
variability or climate change. Effects in this sense may be direct (e.g. changes to agricultural yield&#13;
owing to changes in average values for temperature amplitude or variability) or indirect (e.g.&#13;
damage caused by the increased frequency of coastal flooding due to the sea level rising). â&#128;©&#13;
&#13;
Adaptive capacity: The ability of a system, institution, human being or any other organism to&#13;
mitigate adverse effects or adapt to the consequences of or capitalise on the beneficial effects of&#13;
climate change.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Key: The various types of climate change resilience-building measures. ï&#129;µ Measures aimed at reducing&#13;
climate hazard sensibility, ï&#129;¶ measures aimed at reducing climate hazard vulnerability, ï&#129;· measures aimed at&#13;
building adaptive capacity to climate hazards.&#13;

&#13;
DEFINING ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE&#13;
&#13;
Mitigation: Human actions aimed at reducing the anthropogenic impact on climate forcing; this&#13;
approach consists of reducing the sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or expanding GHG&#13;
storage. An approach aimed at stabilising greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the&#13;
atmosphere to levels which could prevent any dangerous anthropogenic interference with the&#13;
climate system by promoting efforts to reduce or limit GHG emissions or improve GHG&#13;
sequestration.&#13;
&#13;
Adaptation: In human systems this refers to an approach involving the adjustment of the current or&#13;
expected climate, as well as the consequences thereof, so as to mitigate harmful effects and&#13;
harness beneficial effects. In natural systems this refers to an approach involving the adjustment of&#13;
the current climate as well as the consequences thereof; human intervention may facilitate&#13;
adaptation for the expected climate.&#13;
&#13;
Note: Mitigation measures can limit climate change, whereas the goal of adaptation measures is&#13;
the reduction of the vulnerability of natural and socio-economic systems, thereby combating climate&#13;
change at lower cost.&#13;
&#13;
Resilience: The capacity a system and its various components presents with respect to&#13;
anticipating, absorbing and/or withstanding the effects of hazards or to quickly and effectively&#13;
recover from said hazards, including via protective measures, resulting in the rehabilitation and&#13;
improvement of basic structures and operations (see Figure 2-1).&#13;
&#13;
Note: Climate change resilience building for watersheds is an approach which encompasses&#13;
adaptation and is part of the broader development of the river basin. Climate change is therefore&#13;
viewed as a constraint (amongst other things) affecting development. This notably includes 'no&#13;
regret' measures.&#13;
&#13;
Maladaptation: The risk of implementing measures which may ultimately harm&#13;
populations/ecosystems, i.e. measures which may be beneficial in the short term or at the local&#13;
level but may also affect vulnerability or the ability to adapt to climate change over the long term or&#13;
other spatial scale.&#13;
&#13;
Some adaptation strategies may increase the vulnerability of other ecosystems, sectors or&#13;
populations where (i) they increase greenhouse gas emissions, (ii) they disproportionately have an&#13;
impact on more vulnerable areas, (iii) opportunity costs prove too high, (iv) they reduce incentives&#13;
for adaptation or (v) where they lead to pathways which limit the choices available to future&#13;
generations. These five risks for maladaptation provide a basis which can be used to analyse any&#13;
possible adverse effects arising from adaptation measures (Barnett &amp; O'Neill, 2009).&#13;
&#13;
The various types of adaptation measures&#13;
&#13;
The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe has defined the various options in terms of&#13;
projects available based on expected climate benefits (United Nations &amp; the EEC, 2009):&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Win-win options (measures which are shown to be highly cost-effective and which minimise&#13;
  climate risk and offer further advantages). These often refer to activities dealing with the effects&#13;
  of climate change and/or meeting other social and environmental objectives, e.g. efficient use&#13;
  of water, particularly hot water (reduces demand for water as well as GHG emissions).&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; No regret options (measures which are known to be cost-effective and useful, regardless of the&#13;
  magnitude of climate change). These are measures which are warranted due to current climate&#13;
  conditions and which are compatible with projected climate change, e.g. the promotion of good&#13;
  soil management practices to limit the risks of diffuse pollution.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Low regret options (measures with low cost-effectiveness, but significant benefits which depend&#13;
   on future climate change), e.g. an oversized drainage network.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Flexible adaptation options (measures which are designed to be modified in future), e.g.&#13;
  designing a reservoir such that the size could be increased in future.&#13;

So as to better align future measures to be proposed within the scope of the Niger Basin Authority&#13;
(NBA) Operational Plans (OPs) and/or Strategic Action Plans (SAPs), it is important to firstly&#13;
highlight the co-ordination required from the various elements involved with the NBA programmatic&#13;
framework (see the illustration below).&#13;
&#13;
In 2002, NBA Member States decided to draft a Shared Vision which would consist of making the&#13;
Niger River Basin 'an area of sustainable development with respect to the integrated management&#13;
of water resources and related ecosystems so as to improve the quality of life and offer prosperity&#13;
for the surrounding populations'.&#13;
&#13;
Afterwards, during the 8th Heads of State and Government Summit held on 30 April 2008 in&#13;
Niamey, Niger, the Member States adopted a Sustainable Development Action Programme&#13;
(SDAP) for 2027, an Investment Programme (IP) for 2008-2027 and a Water Charter.&#13;
&#13;
The SDAP is a strategic reference document which defines and offers guidelines on the integrated&#13;
and shared development process for NBA Member States.&#13;
&#13;
The IP, which is the budgetary implementation document for the SDAP, consists of three (3) main&#13;
priority development components: (i) the development of socio-economic infrastructures, (ii) the&#13;
protection of resources and ecosystems and (iii) capacity building for and the involvement of key&#13;
players for the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) scheme.&#13;
&#13;
The IP is spread out over several five-year plans: (i) the Five-year Priority Plan (FPP) for 2008-&#13;
2012, (ii) the Second Five-year Plan for 2013-2017, (iii) the Third Five-year Plan for 2018-2022 and&#13;
the Fourth Five-year Plan for 2023-2027.&#13;
&#13;
In November 2012 the NBA drafted a ten-year Strategic Plan (SP) for 2013-2022.&#13;
&#13;
This SP defined five strategic areas of action: (i) water as an economic development lever, (ii) the&#13;
preservation of basin ecosystems, (iii) innovative and sustainable financing, (iv) co-operation with&#13;
fellow Member States and partners and (v) organisational performance.&#13;
&#13;
The operationalization process for this strategic plan consisted in a series of national and regional&#13;
workshops held in 2013 and 2014 with the goal of identifying priority actions and projects for&#13;
Member States (indexed in the form of project information sheets) per IP and SDAP measures and&#13;
NBA strategic plan guidelines as well as agreeing on which priority actions and projects&#13;
implemented in the Niger River Basin should be monitored by the NBA over the next ten years. The&#13;
NBA Operational Plan for 2016-2024 consists of the physical and financial programming for these&#13;
priority actions and projects. This document is currently being validated by NBA authorities.&#13;

ï&#131;¨ A high degree of uncertainty is currently present in for Niger River Basin climate projections,&#13;
  particularly with regard to rainfall.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CLIMATE AND HYDROLOGICAL HAZARDS CONTEMPLATED&#13;
&#13;
There are two aspects to the development of climate variables within the context of climate change:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; extreme weather phenomena;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; shifts in mean values (e.g. migration of isohyets, disturbance of rainfall patterns).&#13;
&#13;
With climate projections being quite uncertain for some parameters (particularly rainfall), it is&#13;
difficult to assess likely climate and hydrological impacts in terms of the nature of these impacts,&#13;
their intensity, frequency and spatial variability.&#13;
&#13;
Taking a generic inventory of climate and hydrological impacts has been proposed (see Table 1-1),&#13;
with this list being used to draw up a cause and effect flow chart (Figure 1-1) afterwards. This chart&#13;
is then broken down for each sector for the purposes of identifying the specific second-order&#13;
impacts.&#13;

For criterion 8, Project Preparation Stage, the goal here is harmonisation with the project&#13;
preparation stage assessment system used in the NBA OP.&#13;
&#13;
For criteria to be marked as '0/1/2/3', assessment in this respect is as follows:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; 0: this measure has no connection to climate change resilience building or adaptation.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; 1: this measure has an indirect connection with climate change resilience building or adaptation.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; 2: the main objective for the measure is not climate change adaptation or resilience building&#13;
   although it would greatly contribute to the foregoing (as a co-benefit).&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; 3: this measure is directly related to climate change resilience building or adaptation.&#13;
&#13;
For criteria to be marked as '0/1':&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; '0' means the criterion has not been met,&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; whilst '1' means the criterion has been met.&#13;

CRITERION 6 DEFINITION. MALADAPTATION.&#13;
&#13;
Criterion definition: Broader integration over a longer period of time and under contrasting possible&#13;
scenarios for any future changes, bearing in mind interactions between sectors and financing.&#13;
&#13;
The goal of this criterion is preventing measures being selected, particularly major developments&#13;
such as multiple use structure work and irrigated perimeters, which could result in 'maladaptation'.&#13;
&#13;
Works should provide significant benefits in terms of adaptation:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Structural works capable of storing volumes of water during times when the resource is&#13;
  abundant and then releasing it during drier periods ('regulation') for the purpose of meeting&#13;
  needs which otherwise would not be met. These works should therefore be able to reduce&#13;
  instances where the availability of water resources is lower than normal as well as the&#13;
  deterioration of ecosystems and the water quality at low water marks. Works should likewise&#13;
  assume a protective function against flooding by reducing water levels, thereby reducing the&#13;
  vulnerability of populations downstream of the risk. Lastly works should be able to provide&#13;
  benefits for mitigation via hydropower generation.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Irrigated perimeters are used to bring water to crops during periods where this resource is not&#13;
   available. They therefore reduce vulnerability caused by low water resource availability and&#13;
   may constitute, where certain conditions have been met - e.g. the type of crops being grown,&#13;
   the overall agro-economic context they are used in, financial beneficiaries etc. - a food safety&#13;
   improvement tool.&#13;
&#13;
These types of works tend to generate more economic activity and revenue.&#13;
&#13;
However irrigated perimeters may also induce effects which prove inhibitive to climate change&#13;
adaptation (maladaptation):&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Structural works reservoirs may allow large volumes of water to evaporate. With the amount that&#13;
  has evaporated into the atmosphere, there is not enough for the intended use downstream.&#13;
  Lastly these works, whenever floods are levelled off, are susceptible to flash flood waves in wet&#13;
  zones located downstream and which could have a negative impact on ecosystems and&#13;
  economic activities which depend on said ecosystems (e.g. the Inner Delta or Coastal Delta).&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Irrigated perimeters induce losses when water is transferred from its place of removal to the&#13;
   place of application for crops. The flow rate may also end up competing with other intended&#13;
   uses downstream which would be more relevant with respect to climate change adaptation.&#13;
&#13;
In order to assess, at least as an initial approach, the performance level of works with respect to&#13;
adaptation, an indicator should be set which allows for the comparison of positive and negative&#13;
effects:&#13;
&#13;
For multiple use reservoirs, we would propose using the following indicators:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
For irrigated perimeters:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
For adaptation it would be desirable for the measures being put forward:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; not to reduce the overall water balance;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; not to induce poor or low valuation of water resources.&#13;
&#13;
These indicators could therefore be used to identify measures which could generate maladaptation.&#13;

&#13;
Various sources of funding and initiatives have been set up by multilateral development banks and&#13;
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the purposes of&#13;
financing needs with respect to climate change adaptation. The main initiatives as have been&#13;
identified are as follows:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The Green Climate Fund (GCF, UNFCCC) : the Green Climate Fund, which was officially&#13;
  recorded during the 2010 CancÃºn conference, will help contribute to reaching the final goal of&#13;
  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Within the context&#13;
  of sustainable development, the Green Climate Fund encourages energy transition and&#13;
  climate-resilient development by contributing financial support to developing countries to adapt&#13;
  to and mitigate the effects of climate change, all the while taking into account the needs of&#13;
  these countries, which are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change&#13;
  (GCF, 2015). The Green Climate Fund should have accrued upwards of 100 thousand million&#13;
  dollars per year by 2020, with half of this amount being allocated to adaptation projects. It was&#13;
  recently decided that half of this amount being allocated for adaptation would be dedicated to&#13;
  more vulnerable countries.&#13;
      The selection process is based on 6 compulsory criteria broken down into subcriteria, of which&#13;
      one at the very least should be met (1- The potential of the expected results and impact of the&#13;
      action, 2- The potential of the action to catalyse a large-scale paradigm shift, 3- The potential&#13;
      for sustainable development and co-benefits, 4- Financing needs and the vulnerability of the&#13;
      recipient country, 5- Country ownership, 6- The efficiency and economic effectiveness of the&#13;
      action). Priorities with respect to action categories and geographical regions have been set and&#13;
      have been included in the table below.&#13;

ï&#130;&#132; Climate Investment Funds (CIF) (BM, BAfD, BAsD, BERD, BID): These were created in 2008&#13;
  as a rapid climate change financial instrument for the world, receiving US$8.1 thousand million.&#13;
  CIFs provide developing countries with grants, concessional loans, risk mitigation instruments&#13;
  and share acquisition to catalyse major financing in the private sector, multilateral development&#13;
  banks (MDBs) and other similar players. There are actually two funds: the Clean Technology&#13;
  Fund (CTF) and the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF):&#13;
  - The Clean Technology Fund (CTF) has an annual amount of US$ 5.3 thousand million and&#13;
      provides financial support to middle-income countries to mitigate the effects of climate&#13;
      change. It encourages the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions via the implementation&#13;
      of low-carbon technology in the areas of renewable energy, energy efficiency and&#13;
      sustainable transport.&#13;

       -      The Strategic Climate Fund (SCF) acts as a general framework to support three targeted&#13;
              programmes with dedicated financing for new approaches with the potential for scale&#13;
              increases as well as transformative actions with the goal of dealing with a specific&#13;
              challenge related to climate change or providing sector-specific solutions.&#13;
                         ï&#131;¼ The goal of the Forest Investment Programme (FIP) is to support actions in&#13;
                             countries who are keen to reduce GHG emissions as a result of&#13;
                             deforestation and forest degradation (to the tune of US$785 million). This&#13;
                             programme is aimed at actions targeting the management, development and&#13;
                             restoration of forest areas as included in the CIP (270,000 ha and 25 actions&#13;
                             in question).&#13;
                         ï&#131;¼ The Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience (PPCR) is the SCF's first&#13;
                             operational programme which began in 2008, with US$1.2 million. The&#13;
                             purpose of this programme is piloting and demonstrating various ways of&#13;
                             incorporating climate risk and resilience within development planning as a&#13;
                             complement to other activities currently under way. It consists of four&#13;
                             components: (i) the development and dissemination of good agricultural and&#13;
                             food safety practices, (ii) strengthening the resilience of supply&#13;
                             infrastructures for potable water and sanitation, (iii) the collection, analysis&#13;
                             and use of meteorological and hydrological data and (iv) feasibility studies&#13;
                             with respect to strengthening the resilience of coastal region habitats. This&#13;
                             programme would appear to be best suited to CIP action financing&#13;
                             needs.&#13;
                         ï&#131;¼ The aim of the Programme for Scaling Up Renewable Energy in Low&#13;
                             Income Countries (SREP) is to show the economic, social and&#13;
                             environmental viability of low-carbon development for the energy sector&#13;
                             (US$796 million).&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Adaptation Fund: This fund is wholly dedicated to projects and programmes aimed at&#13;
  combating the negative effects of climate change in developing countries. That means that only&#13;
  costs related to the implementation of a specific adaptation action would be funded. The&#13;
  Adaptation Fund will only finance projects and programmes whose main, explicit objective is&#13;
  climate change adaptation and improving resilience (Adaptation Fund, 2014).&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; 'Traditional' development backers: the whole of bilateral and multilateral donors (World Bank,&#13;
   EU, UNDP, ADB, AfDB, BEI, JICA, AFD, KfW, USAID, etc.) who actively participate in financing&#13;
   adaptation measures in developing countries. The aforementioned funds normally finance&#13;
   projects led by development backers.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Regional financial institutions: Both the CEMAC/ECCAS and UEMOA/ECOWAS have public&#13;
  policies on climate change adaptation and have developed financing and adaptation tools such&#13;
  as the FEVAC during the COP 21 conference. These funds may be accessed to support the&#13;
  implementation of CIPs.&#13;

1.            INTRODUCTION.&#13;
&#13;
Essentially (65%) coming from of the 2016-2024 NBA Operational Plan, the actions of CRIP will be&#13;
implemented according to the strategy defined in the OP and adopted in a regional workshop of&#13;
NBA member countries on 12 September 2015 in Cotonou. This chapter reminds of the methods of&#13;
intervention and cooperation of the ES/NBA, and with the partners involved in the CRIP that are:&#13;
countries, Technical and Financial Partners.&#13;
&#13;
2.            General aspects on the implementation of CRIP actions&#13;
&#13;
In the chronology of the implementation of CRIP actions, those of the (Knowledge and Institutions) 4&#13;
Package will be primarily implemented to support the implementation of the actions of the sectoral&#13;
actions package that contribute to strengthen the resilience of people and ecosystems of the basin&#13;
to the climate change impacts5.&#13;
&#13;
To finance country-investments of the CRIP, member countries are expected to provide a national&#13;
contribution to the financing of each action. For the entire OP, a financial contribution of at least&#13;
10% is requested from member countries to mark their commitment to the implementation of&#13;
adaptation and resilience actions to climate change.&#13;
&#13;
Following the evaluation of the implementation of the 1st three-year plan of the CRIP, priority&#13;
actions of the 2nd and 3rd year plans will be a rolling update 6 to reflect the status of&#13;
implementation of the actions of the previous three-year plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.   IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIONS OF THE â&#128;&#156;KNOWLEDGE AND INSTITUTIONSâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
PACKAGE&#13;
&#13;
3.1.          Objectives and results&#13;
&#13;
Managing the variability and hydro-climatic uncertainties requires an improving knowledge of the&#13;
climate and its impacts on natural resources, development of modeling tools for decision support.&#13;
Also, the Package of actions No.1: â&#128;&#156;Knowledge and Institutionsâ&#128;&#157; aims to strengthen the capacity of&#13;
national and regional institutions that support people to practice resilience actions.&#13;
&#13;
Among the institutions implementing the CRIP, will be supported:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The NBA Executive Secretariat;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; National Focal Structures;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Non-state organizations working on the ground in the area of climate change.&#13;
&#13;
3.2.          Support to ES/NBA&#13;
&#13;
In charge of promoting cooperation between member countries and contributing to improving the&#13;
living conditions of the people of the basin through the sustainable management of water resources&#13;
and associated ecosystems in accordance with the term of the mandate assigned to it by the&#13;
revised Convention of Nâ&#128;&#159;djamena establishing the Niger Basin Authority and signed by the Heads&#13;
of State and Government of the nine (9) NBA member countries on 29 October 1987, the ES/NBA&#13;
and NFS will benefit from the Investment actions of the No.1 â&#128;&#156;Knowledge -Institutionsâ&#128;&#157; Package of&#13;
the CRIP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Support to the ES/NBA in its basic functions&#13;
&#13;
Basic functions of the ES/NBA will be strengthened:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; in terms of environmental monitoring of the basinâ&#128;&#159;s resources through the development of the&#13;
   Niger Basin Observatory.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; as regards the hydrological and hydro-geological monitoring of the River Niger Basin and its&#13;
   tributaries by supporting the intensification of the monitoring network of hydrological flows and&#13;
   water quality.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; as regards the development of hydrological forecasting and the development of its early&#13;
   warning system.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; regarding the identification and implementation of sustainable funding for the operation and&#13;
   technical investments of ES/NBA.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; regarding managing and improving its performance by increasing its human resources,&#13;
   improving working conditions.&#13;
&#13;
Technically, individual and collective skills of the ES/NBA and NFS executives will be strengthened&#13;
through the implementation of the training plan which is being developed. This training plan will be&#13;
enriched with themes related to Climate Change (CC), to climate change impacts and adaptation&#13;
and mitigation measures.&#13;
&#13;
Support to the setting up of a monitoring-evaluation system&#13;
&#13;
Planning, monitoring &amp; evaluation of the CRIP will follow the logic being defined for the&#13;
implementation of the Operational Plan of which the CRIP is a part. The M&amp;E system will be aimed&#13;
at conducting a timely collection, processing and dissemination of appropriate information on the&#13;
implementation process of planned activities, the physical and financial achievements and results&#13;
achieved7 in order to enable stakeholders to implement and policy makers to make decisions that&#13;
will enable the speeding up and maximizing of expected results.&#13;
&#13;
This M&amp;E system will be based on four (4) components or interdependent pillars which are:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Planning: It will first be for three years then broken down in detail for each year through Annual&#13;
  Work Plans and Budget (AWPB),&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Monitoring of activities and supervision of implementation: This activity will measure progress&#13;
  and performance achieved following the logic of transformation of activities and results of&#13;
  resources made available to the stakeholders;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Monitoring of results: It helps measure progress recorded in achieving the intermediate and&#13;
  strategic outcomes. To do this, a performance measurement framework of the CRIP will be&#13;
  established as early as the 1st year of implementation;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Audits and evaluations: They will be conducted by independent consultancy firms to ensure that&#13;
  the financial resources made available to the ES/NBA, NFS or supported institutions use&#13;
  resources for their goals.&#13;
&#13;
Supervisory and audit operations will be conducted each year. The evaluations will be scheduled&#13;
as follows:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Annual reviews (annual reports);&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; A mid-term evaluation of the first three-year plan of the CRIP or OP;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; A mid-term evaluation of the Strategic Plan during the 2nd year of the three-year plan. A final&#13;
  evaluation of the Strategic Plan.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The organizational system of planning, monitoring and periodic evaluation of CRIP results will&#13;
extend to the Executive Secretariat and to the countries (NFS and NCU). This offshoot of the&#13;
system will enable greater ownership of the planning system (including the work plans), increased&#13;
accountability and a more concerted management between the regional and national levels.&#13;
&#13;
Support to the establishment of an effective internal                                                                                 and   external&#13;
communication of the CRIP/NBA among stakeholders&#13;
&#13;
In the implementation of the CRIP, an effective communication mechanism with each of the&#13;
stakeholders involved in the implementation of the CRIP will be developed.&#13;
&#13;
Objective:&#13;
&#13;
The CRIP/NBA communication plan that will be developed will be aimed to inform and convince all&#13;
along the implementation of CRIP, the Political and Administrative Authorities of NBA member&#13;
countries, the TFPs community, local Communities, Civil Society and the people of the basin on the&#13;
reality of CC so that they can accept to invest in the plan to strengthen the people's resilience to&#13;
climate change in the River Niger Basin. This CRIP/NBA Communication Plan in its implementation&#13;
is divided into 2 parts. They are:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; â&#128;¢           Communication for COP21;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; â&#128;¢           Communication after COP21.&#13;
&#13;
Communication for COP21&#13;
&#13;
This communication aims to bring together the political leaders of the nine (9) NBA member&#13;
countries so that they can lend their group support to the CRIP/NBA to submit to the community of&#13;
donors and technical partners present at the COP 21, the initiative of the resilience plan of the&#13;
people of the River Niger Basin as regards CC.&#13;
&#13;
This communication will be organized around:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; the participation at the COP21 of an ES/NBA technical team of 9 NFS Coordinators of each&#13;
   member country and two representatives of civil society (1 user and 1 user of RNB).&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; the organization of an NBA resilience day with a panel team to present the CRIP/NBA, deliver&#13;
   the advocacy necessary for the TFPs to finance the CRIP/NBA.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; the animation of an NBA stand at the Africa Pavilion.&#13;
&#13;
Communication after COP21&#13;
&#13;
Communication after COP 21 will (1) continue, through international meetings, the dynamics of the&#13;
mobilization of Technical and Financial Partners; (2) promote the CRIP within the countries.&#13;
&#13;
Promotion of the CRIP/NBA within the countries aims to:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Raise awareness among policy makers such as the members of the Finance Commission and&#13;
  Environment Commission of National Assemblies. The aim of this communication is that&#13;
  finance laws that are voted at the meetings should be made available to national projects on&#13;
  the strengthening of population resilience, resources to fund national counterparts of actions&#13;
  registered in the CRIP/NBA document.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Support organizations and technical ministries in the organization of the CC event. These&#13;
  Climate change events is intended to (i) inform the producer groups of the reality on CC (ii)&#13;
  disseminate good practice in terms of sustainable natural resources management (iii) build&#13;
  national alliances (support organization for producers, producer organizations â&#128;&#147; University -&#13;
  Research Institute) to promote, disseminate good practices for resilience.&#13;
&#13;
Communication on CRIP after COP21 will be intense in 2016.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
3.3.     At the level of Countries and state organizations.&#13;
&#13;
The strengthening needs of state and non-state structures such as defined in the CRIP will be met&#13;
as far as possible. These structures will be identified at the pace of actions to be implemented on&#13;
the ground. Under these structures, we have the strengthening of NFS, NCU/RCU.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.   IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIONS OF THE SECTORAL PACKAGE ENHANCING&#13;
POPULATION RESILIENCE, ECOSYSTEMS, INFRASTRUCTURES&#13;
&#13;
The actions of the sectoral package aims to contribute to the strengthening of resilience of&#13;
populations and ecosystems of the basin to climate change through the reduction of exposure&#13;
and/or reduction of the sensitivity of the people or their livelihoods to CC sectoral impacts identified&#13;
in the RNB.&#13;
&#13;
4.1. Implementation of actions of the sectoral                                                                     Package                  enhancing&#13;
population resilience, ecosystems, infrastructures&#13;
&#13;
Objective&#13;
&#13;
Sectoral actions of the CRIP are exclusively investment activities in member countries. These&#13;
actions of this package aim to:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; reduce the vulnerability of populations and or their livelihood situations such as:&#13;
   â&#128;¢ water stress;&#13;
   â&#128;¢ floods;&#13;
   â&#128;¢ degradation of water quality;&#13;
   â&#128;¢ soil degradation;&#13;
   â&#128;¢ degradation of pasture;&#13;
   â&#128;¢ degradation of ecosystems;&#13;
   â&#128;¢ rise in sea level.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; enhance the adaptive capacity of people through the implementation of socio-economic&#13;
   activities.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; implementation of sectoral actions should be planned and implemented in synergy with all the&#13;
   stakeholders whose roles and means of action have been previously defined;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The cooperation topics for the appraisal of actions, the process of research and engagement of&#13;
  funding, programming and implementation of activities in countries are described for each&#13;
  action with various groups of national and regional stakeholders 8 in charge of the planned&#13;
  actions;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The monitoring and evaluation mechanism for the implementation of actions in countries and&#13;
  the monitoring processes will be identified for each country action with the various groups of&#13;
  national and regional stakeholders;&#13;
&#13;
8 ES/NBA, NFS, national technical services, civil society organisations, NGO, firms&#13;

&amp;#12;Appendixes                                                                                                                                   143&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; For each action, the risk of implementation and measures for their mitigation will be identified&#13;
  and monitored by the NFS, Climate change focal points and the NCU in order to prevent delays&#13;
  in the technical, financial and even decision-making implementation;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Countriesâ&#128;&#159; responsiveness to requests from NBA, the TFPs for their projects, as well as their&#13;
  recording among national priority projects, will be decisive in the appraisal, the search for&#13;
  funding and the conduct of NBA projects;&#13;
&#13;
For every country action, the MSDS will be developed. This MSDS should include among others:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; general aspects on the project: reference and/or coding, origin (SP, OP, SDAP, etc.), the&#13;
   location, main recipient countries from the action, duration, cost (overall and OP1), funding&#13;
   source;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; the objectives, outcomes and indicators, project management and the implementation&#13;
   conditions, potential funding sources;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; the addresses of the project holders/country at the national level and at the Executive&#13;
   Secretariat;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; milestones and major activities in progress for maturity (feasibility, evaluation) and for funding;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The risks of implementation for each action.&#13;
&#13;
4.2. Stakeholders    and  actors   of                                                                   cooperation/partners          for   the&#13;
implementation of CRIP/NBA actions&#13;
&#13;
The implementation of the CRIP such as actions of the sectoral Package actions will require:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; soliciting, among others, a multitude of experts and specialists of technical services of the&#13;
   administration, NGOs, consultancy firms, both in the Executive Secretariat, at the level of&#13;
   member countries for the implementation and close monitoring of technical and environmental&#13;
   studies, conduct of actions and capacity building;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; strengthening of cooperation/consultation frameworks with donors, national governments, civil&#13;
   society organizations and the beneficiaries of investments;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; a strong will of member countries to make national legislation in line with the Water Charter.&#13;
&#13;
Therefore, NBA will use different technical partners to support the implementation of the OP or&#13;
CRIP at national and regional levels. This will require for NBA:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; the ability to establish, with national stakeholders of the ToR, contracts/specific cooperation&#13;
   agreement, capacity to control and supervise, the establishment of an effective communication&#13;
   mechanism with each partner;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; to define areas of cooperation (with NGOs, civil society, regional basin organizations), in&#13;
   connection with the expected results of SP, OP and CRIP;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; the completion of the drafting of the annexes to the Water Charter, their dissemination and&#13;
   consensus among member countries on monitoring and decision support tools;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; operationalization of the water management bodies such as the Permanent Technical&#13;
   Committee, sub-basins Commissions, Panel of Experts, Regional Advisory Group, the Niger&#13;
   Basin Observatory (NBO) and NFS.&#13;
&#13;
4.3.          Gender equality&#13;
&#13;
As in all countries, regional and international development organizations, through its interventions,&#13;
NBA will contribute to reducing Gender inequalities for gender equality in all sectors of economic&#13;
and social life of the beneficiaries of projects and programmes.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The adverse effects of climate change are very heavy on the female population in terms of water&#13;
stress, food shortages, etc. Thus, all the actions of capacity building, communication, project and&#13;
programme formulation, conduct of studies and monitoring and evaluation will be integrated where&#13;
possible, differentiated and specific aspects that make visible the actions of NBA projects/&#13;
programmes contributing to reducing gender disparities.&#13;
&#13;
As part of the implementation of coherent actions, the development of an NBA gender policy,&#13;
already started will be finalized and action measures will be identified with countries for their&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.        INSTITUTIONAL SET UP OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CRIP/NBA&#13;
&#13;
5.1.      NBA Governing Bodies&#13;
&#13;
The implementation of the CRIP will be based on NBA policy making, steering and execution&#13;
bodies which are:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The Summit of Heads of State and Government: the supreme policy-making and decision-&#13;
  making body. It meets every two (02) years in an Ordinary Session;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The Council of Ministers: the Authorityâ&#128;&#159;s control body. It is responsible for monitoring the&#13;
  activities of the Executive Secretariat and reports to the Summit of Heads of State and&#13;
  Government. It meets once a year in an Ordinary Session;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The Technical Committee of Experts: It has a mandate to prepare the sessions of the Council of&#13;
  Ministers to which it submits reports and recommendations;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The NBA Executive Secretariat9: It is the coordinating and implementation body of the Authority&#13;
  and is managed by an Executive Secretary.&#13;
&#13;
These statutory bodies are supplemented by:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The Advisory Committee of Partners and Financial Officers (ACPFO): It studies the possibilities&#13;
  of assistance, defines the nature and volume, recalls the implementing rules and monitors the&#13;
  implementation of projects and programmes This body meets once a year on the sidelines of&#13;
  the Council of Ministers meeting.&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; The Regional Steering Committee (RSC) of projects and programmes: Control and decision-&#13;
  making body, reporting to the Council of Ministers through the Executive Secretariat. It meets&#13;
  once (1) a year.&#13;
&#13;
As part of the implementation of the CRIP, these aforementioned bodies are completed by the&#13;
following:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Within the ES/NBA: the Steering and Arbitration Committee (SAC) retained in the&#13;
  implementation strategy of the SP. The SAC is responsible for: (i) the strategic direction and&#13;
  oversight of all NBA interventions; (ii) validation and adoption of the annual activity plans; (iii)&#13;
  review of progress made and provide recommendations on corrective measures. This&#13;

ï&#130;&#132; With Technical and Financial Partners&#13;
&#13;
The implementation of the CRIP, as with the OP, will be monitored through the current ACPFO that&#13;
will expand its powers for this purpose.&#13;
&#13;
5.2.          Intergovernmental and Regional Organizations&#13;
&#13;
In order to widen its thinking and create conditions for the achievement of its strategic results, NBA&#13;
will cooperate on issues of population resilience to climate change with:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; basin organizations and networks of basin organizations (VBA, OMVS, CICOS, ZRA (Zambezi&#13;
   River Authority), INBO, ANBO, etc.) for technical exchanges and sharing of experiences;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; regional organizations for integration and socio-economic development (AU, ECOWAS,&#13;
   ECCAS, WAEMU, CEMAC) for a convergence of their actions for the benefit of the people of&#13;
   the basin.&#13;
&#13;
Cooperation Agreements between NBA and these organizations will be established in connection&#13;
with the results of the Operational Plan and the CRIP. Every two years, cooperation activities will&#13;
be assessed by stakeholders to assess progress and plan future actions.&#13;
&#13;
5.3.          NGOs and development organizations&#13;
&#13;
As part of the implementation of sectoral actions, diversified expertise of NGOs and national or&#13;
international associations will be sought at the regional and national level to ensure support and&#13;
proximity control of the implementation of actions. The following activities will be particularly&#13;
targeted:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; Information and capacity building of users;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; accompanying, monitoring and evaluation of field projects on behalf of NBA;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; control of compliance with environmental standards in the execution of works;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; support to the ownership of techniques and achievements by local people.&#13;
&#13;
Gender promotion associations, among others, will be involved in communication with users and&#13;
the promotion of gender.&#13;
&#13;
5.4.          Project management of CRIP/NBA investments&#13;
&#13;
SP actions can be divided into two (2) categories:&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; regional and national actions with trans-boundary impact;&#13;
ï&#130;&#132; national actions with non-trans-boundary impact.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
i)     Regional actions and national actions with trans-boundary impacts are actions that have&#13;
impacts (positive or negative) for at least two member countries. They are financed by loans,&#13;
donations, grants and legacies or own funds of the member countries or the NBA Executive&#13;
Secretariat.&#13;
&#13;
The project management of the technical, environmental and social studies, the search for funding&#13;
as well as the monitoring and evaluation of these actions is provided by the NBA Executive&#13;
Secretariat in accordance with Decision No.1 of the 9th Summit of Heads of State and&#13;
Government, held on 16 September 2010 in Abuja.&#13;
&#13;
Project management of work, such as that of major infrastructure and facilities is currently provided&#13;
by member countries and could be delegated to the NBA Executive Secretariat.&#13;
&#13;
ii)     National actions with non-trans-boundary impact:&#13;
&#13;
When funding is also provided by owner member countries from their own funds or from loans from&#13;
donors, the project management of studies and work is under the responsibility of each owner&#13;
member country, in accordance with national legislation.&#13;
&#13;
However, when the financing of these actions is mobilized through the NBA Executive Secretariat&#13;
within the context of regional projects/programmes, project management of studies and works is&#13;
provided by the NBA Executive Secretariat. This is the case of projects/programmes such as: (i)&#13;
the Reversing Land and Water Degradation Trends Project in the Niger basin (2005-2011); (ii) the&#13;
Silting Control Programme in the Niger Basin (2004-2015); and (iii) the Water Resources&#13;
Development and Sustainable Ecosystems Management Programme in Niger Basin (2007-2015).&#13;
&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The African continent is among the most
            vulnerable to climate change due to a combination of the
            anticipated effects of climate change and to ongoing
            development challenges, high poverty levels, and low
            adaptive-capacity. The basin suffers further from a large
            adaptation deficit - national and local governments are not
            equipped to respond to ongoing climate-related events, much
            less escalated future events. The Niger basin is an
            expansive region in West Africa that is home to more than
            130 million people throughout the nine countries of Benin,
            Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Mali,
            Niger, and Nigeria. Climate change will compound these
            extreme events and raise further obstacles to the region’s
            achievement of the sustainable development goals related to
            water management, food security, environmental
            sustainability, and health, among others. Two key elements
            bring hope to the region for addressing these challenges:
            (1) a history of cooperation between the riparian countries
            of the Niger basin; and (2) an exceptionally high potential
            for sustainable development that includes
            resilience-building and strengthening of adaptive capacity.
            The Niger basin countries recognize that the shared nature
            of their water resources presents an opportunity for a
            collaboration and coordination that will derive greater
            resilience-building outcomes.
