THAILAND - CASE STUDY OF AGRICULTURAL INPUT AND OUTPUT PRICING&#13;
This study of the Thai rural economy examines the nature of the&#13;
major product and factor markets along with the most important forms of&#13;
government intervention in these markets. Considerable emphasis is&#13;
placed on labor, for which the extent of underemployment is found to be&#13;
grossly exaggerated by current available estimates. This is due in part&#13;
to inadequate recognition of the fact that non-adult males are drawn into&#13;
the labor force only in response to peak season demands and that non-agri-&#13;
cultural employment is substantial. Market and economic returns per unit&#13;
of land, nominal and effective rates of protection and distortion to the&#13;
rate of return to land are estimated for 71 different agricultural&#13;
activities, including 20 different types of rice cultivation. The most&#13;
important effect of government intervention is clearly seen as the&#13;
disincentive given to rice and rubber production, due to heavy export&#13;
taxation. Certain other crops, such as sugarcane, appear to have benefited&#13;
directly from government protection while all other crops have profited&#13;
indirectly from depressed rice prices which reduce the supply price of&#13;
labor and land.&#13;

PREFACE&#13;
This paper is one of a number of companion papers (see below),&#13;
which report on the results of a research project --- Country Case Studies&#13;
of Administered Agricultural Prices, Taxes and Subsidies, RPO 671-42 --&#13;
which commenced in the second half of 1976. The research, which included&#13;
some desk studies besides the eight country case studies (Argentina, Egypt,&#13;
Kenya, Mexico, Pakistan, Portugal, Thailand and Yugoslavia), was oriented&#13;
towards eventually providing operational guidelines for country economic,&#13;
agricultural sector and project planning work. Two of the country case&#13;
studies invrolved the use of formal agricultural sector models (Mexico and&#13;
Portugal), whi-e the other six involved the use of a numDer of informal&#13;
methodologies.&#13;
An overview and integrated summary of the results of the six&#13;
country case studies and the complementary desk studies will be given in:&#13;
"Agricultural Prices, Taxes and Subsidies: a&#13;
Revriew of Experience", a Staff Working Paper&#13;
(forthcoming) prepared by Gilbert Brown anid&#13;

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
1.        The most important developments in agriculture in the post World&#13;
War II period have been (a) the rapid growth in cultivated areas and (b) the&#13;
importance of upland crops relative to rice in this process. Planted area in&#13;
major crops grew by 20% in the 1950s, 25% in the first half of the 1960s, 20%&#13;
in the second half of the 1960s, and by 22% in the first half of the 1970s.&#13;
Maize, kenaf, cassava, rubber, and sugarcane all played important roles in&#13;
this expansion with most of the output directed to export markets.&#13;
2.        Regional specialization is a noteworthy characteristic for many&#13;
crops. In 1974, 76% of all maize production was accounted for by 9 Central&#13;
Changwats, 92% of all cassava was accounted for by 6 Changwats in the North-&#13;
east and East, 92% of all kenaf was accounted for by 9 Changwats in the&#13;
Northeast, and 77% of all sugar cane was accounted for by 6 Changwats in both&#13;
the East and West areas of the inner Central Plain.&#13;
3.        Expansion in area planted rather than increases in land productivity&#13;
has accotunted for most of the post World War II growth in agriculture. This&#13;
has been accomplished with substantial reduction in forest areas (from 57% of&#13;
land area in 1963 to 37% in 1974) and there is growing concern about the&#13;
nature of the 'slash and burn' agriculture underlying such a process.&#13;
4.        The following are the main conclusions regarding the nature of the&#13;
resources and sector markets in rural Thailand:&#13;
(a) Labor&#13;
(i) Despite widespread acceptance of the rural unemployment-&#13;
underemployment thesis and widespread use of shadow wage&#13;
rates well below market wage rates, the supporting empirical&#13;
evidence is weak. Survey results widely cited as a founda-&#13;
tion for these hypotheses have been misinterpreted due&#13;
to inadequate recognition of the high participation rates by&#13;
youngsters and female members of the households who. are drawn&#13;
into the labor force in response to peak season demands and&#13;
due to an inadequate accolxnting for labor utilization in non-&#13;
agricultural activities. The reports in question in fact&#13;
show a dynamic response of the labor market to the seasonal&#13;
swings in demand based on variation in work hours and par-&#13;
ticipation rates without any significant unemployment.&#13;
(ii) The most exteasive data on labor utilization in rural&#13;
Thailand is provided by the Labor Force Surveys carried&#13;
out by the National Statistical Office twice a year during&#13;
the peak and slack agricultural periods. Recent changes&#13;
in the labor force definitions used in these surveys have&#13;
excluded workers with low hours of work who neither seek&#13;
additional employment or refrain from doing so because of&#13;
the belief that work is not available. This has resulted&#13;
in a large (previously unobserved) contraction in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
rural labor force in the slack dry season - by some 30%&#13;
for the economy as a whole with an even greater reduction&#13;
of almost 50% in the Northeast region of the country in&#13;
1974. The 4.3 million reduction in the labor force&#13;
resulted in a negligible increase in unemployment of some&#13;
37 thousand in the slack season of 1974, about a half of&#13;
which occurred in the Northeast.&#13;
(iii) The reduction in the dry season rural labor force reflects&#13;
a very sharp drop in participation by females of all ages&#13;
and by male teenagers and pre-teenagers. There is very&#13;
little decline in participation rates for males above 20&#13;
years of age. The evidence is consistent with the view&#13;
that high rates of return to on-farm employment attracts&#13;
large numbers of household members who are voluntarily&#13;
out of the labor force in the off peak periods.&#13;
(iv) There is a sizeable seasonality in work niours. Long work&#13;
hours are common during the peak seasons with a quarter&#13;
of tbe total labor force over 11 years of age working over&#13;
70 hours a week. Whereas only 7% of the male labor force&#13;
in 1974 worked less than 30 hours a week in the wet season,&#13;
around a third of all males recorded such short hours in&#13;
the dry season. This seasonality is most evident in the&#13;
Northeast which has both the highest proportions of male&#13;
and female workers with work weeks over 70 hours in the&#13;
wet season and with work weeks less than 30 hours in the&#13;
dry season.&#13;
(v) Village studies in different regions of the country, when&#13;
some allowance is made for shorter reference work periods&#13;
for youngsters and when two weeks a year are treated as&#13;
holidays, show rural communities in the Central Plain and&#13;
the North exceed a 40 hour a week norm by over a third while&#13;
villages in the Northeast fall slightly below the same norm.&#13;
(vi) The occupational structure of rural employment again reflects&#13;
the seasonality of agriculture, particularly in the North and&#13;
Northeast compared to the Central plain where double cropping&#13;
is more evident or in the South where both the rain pattern&#13;
differs and dry weather rubber tapping is important in the&#13;
employment picture. In the North and Northeast, agricultural&#13;
employment accounted for two thirds of total employment in&#13;
the dry season in 1974 but expanded by 14 and 20 percentage&#13;
points, respectively, in the wet season.  The expansion of&#13;
manufacturing and construction in the dry season throughout&#13;
the country absorbs almost half a million workers relative&#13;
to a decline in employment in agriculture of some four million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(vii) Village studies in the Central Plain, North and Northeast&#13;
indicate that substantial amounts of work time is accounted&#13;
for by non-agricultural activities. Representative studies&#13;
show on-farm agricultural activities account for around two&#13;
thirds of work hours in the peak season and for around one&#13;
third of slack season work hours.&#13;
(viii) Data from the North show that off-farm employment activities&#13;
are available for farm families without dry season water&#13;
control and double cropping capability. If the "underemploy-&#13;
ment because of agricultural slack" thesis had relevance in&#13;
Thailand, it would certainly imply that underemployment would&#13;
be concentrated among those farmers with land that will not&#13;
support high crop intensities. However, observed work hr'rs&#13;
significantly greater among the single cropping families due&#13;
to higher off farm employment. Since, as expected, income&#13;
levels are higher on double cropped farms, this data reflects&#13;
positive income elasticities of demand for leisure and is in-&#13;
consistent with the main tenets of the underemployment thesis.&#13;
(ix) Data on incomes by source also show a substantial irmportance&#13;
of non-agricultural activities for farm families in Thailand.&#13;
After accounting for non-cash income comprised mainly of&#13;
production of agricultural goods for on farm consumption,&#13;
non-agricultural incomes account on the average for a&#13;
quarter to a half of total incomes. These high levels of&#13;
non-agricultural incomes are difficult to reconcile with the&#13;
view of Thai farmers with severely limited employment&#13;
opportunities during the slack agricultural periods.&#13;
(x) While wage income is important to the farm household virtually&#13;
all year round, wages earned in agricultural activities are&#13;
only significant in the peak planting and harvesting periods.&#13;
While these periods stretch for large parts of the year for&#13;
some crops (i.e., rubber is tapped except when the rains&#13;
prevent it or low returns discouirage it), farmers are ob-&#13;
taining significant wage incomes from agricultural activities&#13;
for only about four months a year in most areas of the country.&#13;
(xi) The landless rural labor class in Thailand is very small.&#13;
The 1963 agricultural census recorded 3.9 million farm&#13;
families of which only 1.5% were without land. Employees&#13;
in agricultural activities accounted for less than 5% of&#13;
the agricultural labor force in rural areas of the North&#13;
and Northeast in the 1970s. A higher rate is found in&#13;
the more commercialized central plain and in the South&#13;
but even here employees in rural areas account for only&#13;
about 10% of the labor force. Since over 99% of the re-&#13;
mainder are either self-employed farmers or unpaid family&#13;
workers, the dominance of family labor on family farms is&#13;
a striking characteristic of the rural sector in most&#13;
parts of the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(xii) Rural wages vary significantly in Thailand in response&#13;
to the peaks in agricultural activities and across regions&#13;
as prospects and/or planting or harvesting periods vary&#13;
with crops specialized in particular areas. The limited&#13;
data available on rural wages indicates a general stability&#13;
in real wages in the 1960s. In areas where crops have done&#13;
well in the 1970s or where double-cropping has increased,&#13;
an increase in real wages has occurred. The wage experience&#13;
in the South in r-dbber areas, in the double-cropped areas of&#13;
the Central Plain, and in areas where bumper crops or high&#13;
product prices occurred (as with rice, sugar, tobacco, maize)&#13;
strongly indicates that a perfectly elastic supply of labor&#13;
does not characterize significant parts of the rural economy.&#13;
(xiii) There is considerable evidence of the adoption of more capi-&#13;
tal intensive techniques of land preparation and less labor&#13;
intensive planting techiques in areas of the country where&#13;
labor markets have been particularly tight.&#13;
(xiv) The evidence on labor utilization, the income generation&#13;
process, and movement of market wage rates does not support&#13;
the hypothesis of an accounting wage rate below the market wage&#13;
rate. The only significant factor suggesting a difference&#13;
between the accounting and market wage is the nature of dis-&#13;
tortions in product markets. Since the market prices of&#13;
important agricultural pi ducts understate the economic value&#13;
of these commodities due to the effacts of export taxation,&#13;
the opportunity cost of rural labor is understated and the&#13;
appropriate accounting price is probably greater rather than&#13;
lower than the prevailing market wages. However, the&#13;
lack of determinant resource allocation implications in rea-&#13;
sonable models in which some indeterminancy in the production&#13;
pattern occurs means that the such accounting wage rates are&#13;
indeterminant and estimates must be based on somewhat&#13;
arbitrary adjustments.&#13;
(b) Land&#13;
(i) Thai agriculture is based largely on family labor working&#13;
family firms. However, there has been a noticeable increase&#13;
in the share of land under rental contracts in each and every&#13;
region of the country. The area rented has reached significant&#13;
proportions (15% or above) throughout the Central Plain and&#13;
in the North. The increase in the lower Central Plain has&#13;
resulted in a third of the land not being owned by the farmers&#13;
cultivating it. For the total country, tenancy was minor in&#13;
1963 (3.6%) but this share tripled by 1971 (11.9%).&#13;
(ii) Data on tenancy ratios in Thailand have been misinter-&#13;
preted through neglect of the rapid expansion that has&#13;
occurred in agricultural land holdings. In every region&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-v -&#13;
except the lower Central Plain and the South, the growth in&#13;
land under cultivation has outstripped the growth in the&#13;
farm populatiorn between 1963 and 1973. Furthermore, the&#13;
land owned by the farmer working it per head of agricultural&#13;
population has increased in every region except the lower&#13;
Central Plain, despite the dramatic increases in rental&#13;
ratios. Since the lower Central Plain accounts for less&#13;
than 9% of total area in agricultural holdings and less than&#13;
8% of total. farm population, this minor decrease in this&#13;
single region should be kept in perspective to the overall&#13;
expansion that has increased the average amount of land per&#13;
farm population by some 22% for the country as a whole.&#13;
(iii) Data on the distribution of land holdings shows little&#13;
evidence of significant fragmentation of holdings or&#13;
concentration in large sized farms. Family farms have&#13;
maintained their dominance in Thai agriculture and the&#13;
relatively equitable distribution of land holdings in&#13;
Thailand is remarkable compared to most other less&#13;
developed countries.&#13;
(iv) An analysis of land tenure in selected villages in the&#13;
Central Plain by Stifle for the 1910 to 1972 period&#13;
shows that periods of land transfer more rapid than can&#13;
be explained by normal intergenerational transfer -&#13;
possibly reflecting economic distress in the farm&#13;
community - are observed only for the depression period&#13;
1925-34 and in the immediate postwar years 1945-49.&#13;
There is no evidence of a dramatic increase in land&#13;
concentration among wealthy landlords.&#13;
(v) Pre World War II irrigation consisted of canals used&#13;
to direct water over the Central Plains whenever the&#13;
annual flooding occurred but was not in general capable&#13;
of affecting the timing of water availability. In the&#13;
post war period, however, there has been substantial&#13;
investments in dam systems which have provided water&#13;
control and double cropping potential. Despite some&#13;
controversy over the areas actually benefitting from&#13;
irrigation facilities, it appears that about one-third&#13;
of cultivated area in the Central Plain, a tenth of the&#13;
areas in the North and very small areas in the Northeast&#13;
and the South obtain irrigation benefits. The areas&#13;
receiving dry season water control are much more limited;&#13;
less than 10% in the Central Plain, 2.5% in the North,&#13;
and less than 1% in the Northeast and the South.&#13;
(vi) Based on projected or under construction irrigation projects,&#13;
the potential for improved water control can be sketched out&#13;
for the upcoming decade and a half. The wet season irrigated&#13;
area for 1990 will be less than 15% of the present cultivated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-vi-&#13;
area (abouit 14% for the North; 3% for the Northeast; 37% for&#13;
the Central Region; and 10% for the South). The projected&#13;
wet season irrigated area represents 34% of present paddy&#13;
land compared to 26% in 1975. The dry season irrigated area&#13;
in 1990, despite more than doubling since 1975, will be less&#13;
than 7% of cultivated area of recent years and less than 16%&#13;
of wet season paddy area in 1975. Thus agriculture outside&#13;
of the Central Plain will be dominated by rainfed agriculture&#13;
for decades to come.&#13;
5.        The following are the main conclusions regarding the nature and effects&#13;
of government intervention policies affecting the rural economy:&#13;
(a) The most important form of government intervention has&#13;
occurred via restricting the rural sector's access to&#13;
world markets for major agricultural products, mainly&#13;
via heavy export taxation of rice and of rubber. The&#13;
sugar cane sector has also been greatly affected through&#13;
policies which have isolated domestic prices from world&#13;
price levels; intervention that generally resulted in&#13;
protectiorn to the sector except for a period of heavy&#13;
taxation during the mid 1970s. Significant intervention&#13;
in markets for agricultural inputs occurred between 1968&#13;
and 1973 when protection to domestic production led to in-&#13;
flated prices for nitrogen based fertilizer and through&#13;
irrigation system which supplies water at zero or near&#13;
zero cost to farmers.&#13;
(b) Rice production was taxed at low rates after the removal&#13;
of the ban on exports in the mid 19th Century until imme-&#13;
diately following World War II when heavy taxation was&#13;
introduced via export licensing arrangements, unfavorable&#13;
exchange rates applied to foreign exchange earnings on rice,&#13;
and through export license fees and taxes. During the stable&#13;
19J5-1966 period, rice taxation was at a rate around 40% of&#13;
the FOB price which implies a tax of slightly over 80% of the&#13;
farmgate prices. The period since 1966 has been less stable&#13;
with two periods of high rice prices in 1966-69 and in 1972-75&#13;
leading to higher rates of taxation designed primarily to&#13;
moderate upward pressure on domestic rice prices. Between&#13;
1966 and 1972 and in the post 1975 period, there has been&#13;
a sharp reduction in rice taxation in the face of depressed&#13;
world prices in the first period and greater concern for rural&#13;
interests in the second period. In addition to rice taxation,&#13;
there have been attempts during high price periods to introduce&#13;
subsidy programs for low income urban consumers and to introduce&#13;
price support programs during the post 1975 period. These&#13;
latter efforts have been small and ineffective.&#13;
(c) The sugar industry is the one important agricultural&#13;
sector where government policies have provided protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-vii-&#13;
and maintained domestic price levels substantially&#13;
above world price levels through most of the post World&#13;
War II period. The high level of protection led to com-&#13;
plete substitution of imports followed by heavy subsi-&#13;
dies to exports combined with production controls. The&#13;
booming world sugar market of 1973/74 led to a shift in&#13;
policy with heavy export taxation. The decline in world&#13;
market prices in 1976 and 1977 has seen a return to con-&#13;
trols on the expansion of sugar, complete protection for&#13;
the domestic market, and low export subsidies.&#13;
(d) In addition to the heavy protection to sugar, price&#13;
supports for sugar cane have been introduced at various&#13;
times. These policies have probably not been very&#13;
effective since the support price has either been close&#13;
to the market price or the controls have been widely&#13;
avoided by setting high transportation charges for the&#13;
movement of cane from the fields.&#13;
(e) Government intervention in the rubber sector has been&#13;
moderate prior to the past decade. In the 1930s, a 7%&#13;
ad valorem tax was levied on rubber exports, a low level&#13;
of taxation that was maintained until 1960. A sliding tax&#13;
schedule based on rubber prices was instituted in 1960.&#13;
This at first led to substantially higher taxation (about&#13;
17%) but this was reduced to around 10% with the lower,&#13;
prices of the mid-1960s. The latest changes in export&#13;
taxation occurred in 1967 when the export tax formula&#13;
was revised and a cess on exports was imposed in. order&#13;
to finance a rubber replanting project. While the new&#13;
tax formula implied tax rates only slightly above the&#13;
historical rates prior to 1973, the taxes have been at&#13;
average rates of from 15% to almost 20% since then. With&#13;
competitive market arrangements, a 15-20% tax on the FOB&#13;
price represents a 25-35% tax on the farmgate price. With&#13;
good prospects for favorable rubber prices and a tax formula&#13;
that has a marginal rate of 50%, the rubber sector may well&#13;
become the most significantly taxed sector in Thai agriculture&#13;
in coming years.&#13;
(f) Market intervention in rubber, aside from taxation, occurs&#13;
through the rubber replanting program. At least 30% of the&#13;
present rubber area needed to be replanted over the last&#13;
decade and a half. Due to a rapid increase in replanting&#13;
in the 1970s, some 36% of this area has been replanted,&#13;
about 11% of the total area in rubber. This program faces&#13;
two important problems (a) because a substantial increase&#13;
in the rate of replanting is required if the backlog of&#13;
senescent trees are to be cleared before the 1.23 million&#13;
rai of land planted in the early 1950's requires replanting&#13;
&#13;

in the early 1980s and (b) because perhaps as much as 72%&#13;
of immature rubber in the mid-1970s was based on new&#13;
plantings of traditional rubber varieties outside the&#13;
scope of the replanting program.&#13;
(g) The remarkable expansion that has occurred in maize, kenaf,&#13;
and cassava has developed with limited direct government&#13;
intervention. The aggregate farm value of these crops now&#13;
accounts for 13% of the total value of crops in agriculture,&#13;
over a quarter of the value of crops other than rice, and&#13;
over a fifth of the total value of exports. Even less&#13;
interference has occurred in the oil seeds, other fiber&#13;
crops, fruits, and vegetable crops.&#13;
(h) During the period 1968-1973, production of nitrogen based&#13;
fertilizer was protected by giving a monoploy on the imports&#13;
of nitrogen based fertilizers to the domestic producer. The&#13;
main results were: (a) retail prices for nitrogen based fer-&#13;
tilizers some two thirds above free market prices; (b) limited&#13;
growth in fertilizer use in Thai agriculture; and (c) a shift&#13;
of fertilizer imports into mixed or non-nitrogen based fer-&#13;
tilizers not subject to monopoly control. Price inflating&#13;
policies have been eliminated and the interference that occurs&#13;
at the present time involves mainly subsidy programs financed&#13;
from export taxation on agricultural products.&#13;
(i) The zero or near zero price charged farmers for water from&#13;
irrigation facilities in Thailand represents an important&#13;
subsidy to the agricultural sector. Since there is some&#13;
correlation between land producing a surplus for off farm&#13;
sales and the degree of water control, this subsidy is&#13;
therefore offset to some degree by export taxes on agri-&#13;
cultural products.&#13;
(j)  A series of summary measures of the distortions in the&#13;
price structure for the agricultural economy were calcu-&#13;
lated. The main conclusions based on these calculations&#13;
are: first, the traditional price discriminations against&#13;
rice of around 40% of FOB prices results in market returns&#13;
to land that undervalue the economic returns by some 50-75%;&#13;
second, the rice distortions lead to market returns to land&#13;
that are generally around 100-300 baht per rai, substantially&#13;
below returns observed for other crops or crop combinations;&#13;
third, aside from some non-traded commodities with prices&#13;
linked to rice, the only other significant crop with product&#13;
prices depressed by market interventions is rubber; fourth,&#13;
significantly protected crops include sugarcane and cotton&#13;
which benefit from export subsidies and import tariffs re-&#13;
spectively; fifth, products with low nominal rates of pro-&#13;
tection have low distortions to the rates of return on land&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and low effective rate of protection - a result mainly of&#13;
the offsetting effects of the rice price distortions on wage&#13;
costs and minor levels of protection on chemical and machinery&#13;
costs; sixth, the incentives on returns to land in the pro-&#13;
tected crops is substantial, a result explained by the effect&#13;
of moderate levels of nominal protection being augmented by the&#13;
impact of rice taxation in depressing the market price of labor.&#13;
(k) The provision of zero or low cost water supplies represents&#13;
a significant incentive for crops that are subject to minor&#13;
price distortions, i.e. most upland and garden crops. While&#13;
the water subsidy effect is substantial for irrigated rice,&#13;
this has in the past been minor relative to the disincentive&#13;
provided by the depressing effect of export taxes on domestic&#13;
rice prices.&#13;
(1) The most important effect of government intervention has been&#13;
the disincentive of rice production and the corresponding&#13;
stimulus to diversification into other crops due to the&#13;
heavy export taxation on rice. This taxation has contributed&#13;
to a decline in Thailand's share of world exports from above&#13;
one quarter in the immediate post war period to about one&#13;
tenth in recent years. Around one fifth of Thai rice was&#13;
typically exported in the early 1960s compared to less&#13;
than one tenth in the mid-1970s. This movement away from&#13;
rice specialization would have been even more rapid if not&#13;
for the continued production of on-farm consumption require-&#13;
ments of rice by most Thai farmers and the unsuitability of&#13;
flooded river basins for other crops in important parts of&#13;
the country. While this diversification has been considered&#13;
an important benefit of government intervention, this argu-&#13;
ment is of questionable validity. With their on-farm con-&#13;
sumption requirements for rice satisfied, farmers become&#13;
very flexible in seeking out the most profitable cash crops.&#13;
Rice evaluated at world prices can hold its own against many&#13;
alternative crop possibilities. It is hard to see why the&#13;
agricultural sector has benefitted by curtailing the prof-&#13;
itability of one of the main crop alternatives. This is&#13;
especially so given that government intervention has occurred&#13;
in such a way as to transfer substantial resources from the&#13;
agriculture to the non-agricultural sector.&#13;
6.        Most of the findings in this study support the argument that&#13;
market mechanisms have worked well in the Thai rural sector. There are&#13;
significant cases in infrastructure development, rational use of land&#13;
resources, and introduction of advanced techniques where there is scope&#13;
for economically profitable government programs. There is little evidence&#13;
of market failure outside these areas despite frequently heard calls for&#13;
expanded intervention in price formation and in marketing channels.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
I. THE RURAL SECTOR IN THAILAND&#13;
1.01    Throughout the post World War II period, economic growth in Thailand has&#13;
compared favorably with most less developed economies. In real terms, growth&#13;
during the 1960s occurred at a rate of 8% per year and has continued at a&#13;
rate of 6.5% in the 1970s. Although this progress has been based predominate-&#13;
ly on a free market economy, government policies have had important effects.&#13;
This study is concerned with government policies directed at the rural sector&#13;
of the economy. It is not possible, however, to understand the effects of&#13;
these policies without first clarifying the main features of the rural eco-&#13;
nomy, especially with respect to the success or failure of market mechanisms&#13;
in allocating resources. Considerable effort has therefore been put in,) the&#13;
study of resources and factor markets in rural Thailand.&#13;
1.02    There is no well-established or comprehensive picture of rural labor&#13;
markets in Thailand. The lack of such an analysis has important implications&#13;
for both evaluating and de3igning government policy. A common hypothesis is&#13;
that the rural sector is characterized by large scale unemployment or underem-&#13;
ployment. This has been used to justify accounting shadow !/ prices of labor&#13;
that are well below market rates. Since labor is the dominant factor cost in&#13;
most production processes in rural Thailand, such a failure of labor markets&#13;
can have major implications aimed at altering market incentives. Net benefits&#13;
to direct government investments in the rural sector also depends crucially&#13;
on the nature of employment alternatives open to both project workers and&#13;
farmers expected to benefit from project outputs such as feeder roads or&#13;
irrigation water. A major re-evaluation of the evidence on labor markets in&#13;
rural Thailand has therefore been carried out in Section I (Part A) of this&#13;
report.&#13;
1.03    The nature of land resources and their distribution and utilization&#13;
is also of importance in evaluating existing government policies and in under-&#13;
standing the need or potential for new or expanded programs. For instance,&#13;
production techniques differ substantially for rainfed and water controlled&#13;
agriculture with important implications for the quantitative effects of the&#13;
government interventions in product and factor markets studied in Section II.&#13;
An analysis is therefore carried out on the importance and potential for&#13;
agricultural growth based on the expansion of rainfed agriculture relative&#13;
to growth based on an expanded irrigation infrastructure and/or greater use&#13;
of improved seed varieties and chemical inputs. The response to market incen-&#13;
tives or government intervention in rural markets, or the need for such inter-&#13;
vention, can depend on the nature of the distribution of land and the system of&#13;
land tenure. These questions are also analyzed. This work is reported in&#13;
Section I (Part B).&#13;
1.04    The analysis of government policies towards the agricultural sector&#13;
carried out in Section II concentrates on the major interventions in product&#13;
and factor ma-ckets. While there are significant income distributional effects&#13;
from these policies, it has not been possible to take these into account. The&#13;
study does (a) indicate the relative importance of various policies, (b) ana'yze&#13;

the pressures and/or rationale behind the policies, (c) quantify the incentives&#13;
or disincentives to different agricultural processes due to policy related&#13;
distortions to the structure of prices for both products and factors for both&#13;
rainfed and irrigated agriculture, and (d) indicate the effects of these policies&#13;
on the allocation of resources.&#13;
1.05      Appendix A to the study provides a brief introduction to the geography&#13;
and regional characteristics of Thailand - background information that is useful&#13;
given the regional nature of many of the questions to be studied. Appendix B&#13;
reports on the data used in quantifying incentives, market returns, and economic&#13;
returns to agricultural activities in different regions of the economy. Appendix C&#13;
is a critical evaluation of the methodology frequently used in studies of economic&#13;
returns to different production processes.&#13;
A. Labor in Rural Thailand&#13;
1.06      Misconceptions about rural employment and labor market conditions in&#13;
Thailand are common. The most important of these, as noted above, is the belief&#13;
that rural unemployment is significant and rural underemployment massive,&#13;
particularly during the slack agricultural periods in the dry season. Others&#13;
include the belief that there are very limited non-agricultural and off-farm&#13;
employment opportunities; that such activities account for small proportions&#13;
of farm family incomes; that families with land holdings offering limited&#13;
potential for dry season agriculture are particularly subject to long periods&#13;
of unemployment or underemployment; that lower farm family incomes observed&#13;
in the Northeast as compared to, for instance, the North are mostly due to&#13;
differences in opportunities for non-agricultural or off-farm employment; and&#13;
that labor shortages with rising wage rates are non-existent. These proposi-&#13;
tions do not survive careful analysis.&#13;
1.07      The labor market in rural Thailand is, on the contrary, particularly&#13;
tight during peak agricultural seasons with the labor force stretched by&#13;
drawing youngsters, females from household activities, and workers from non-&#13;
agricultural jobs into agricultural employment that is characterized by long&#13;
work hours. In the dry season, the labor force contracts with a large decline&#13;
in participation by females and youngsters, a shift to off-farm employment by&#13;
members of farm families and substantial reduction in work hours. Even in the&#13;
dry season, however, unemployment in rural Thailand is insignificant. Labor&#13;
utilization is characterized by considerable off-farm and non-agricultural&#13;
employment that accounts for large parts of money income and smaller but signif-&#13;
icant shares of total income. Lower income families with more limited farm land&#13;
resources are able to expand their partic4gation in off-farm employment and to&#13;
reduce income differentials that would otherwise exist between farm families.&#13;
Labor shortages and rising wage rates are important phenonmenon in significant&#13;
areas of the country.&#13;
1.08      In this section, the most influential evidence used in supporting&#13;
the rural underemployment and unemployment thesis is discussed first. The&#13;
wide range of materials available for Thailand is then used to develop a more&#13;
realistic description of labor utilization in the rural sector. Farmers incomes&#13;
and wage rates are then discussed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
The Rural Unemployment-Underemployment Thesis&#13;
1.09      The labor surplus hypothesis has been widely accepted in Thailand.&#13;
For example, it was strongly endorsed in what has become one of the most in-&#13;
fluential analyses of rural labor market conditions in Thailand:&#13;
It *the conclusions is drawn that in general there is already&#13;
a surplus of labor in the farms. Low labor and land producti-&#13;
vity and agricultural inecmes are the consequence of agricul-&#13;
tural unemployment.  Seasonal unemployment is high and in&#13;
contrast to unused physical resources the unused labor potential&#13;
is lost for national development. It is clear that these unused&#13;
human resources, which were wasted under the prevailing circum-&#13;
stances, form an untapped potential to increase the income of the&#13;
rural population." 1/&#13;
It is also prominent in the Fourth Five Year Plan Document (1977-82) which gives&#13;
special emphasis to policies aimed at moderating unemployment and underemployment&#13;
in both rural and urban Thailand:&#13;
"...underemployment in the agricultural sector persists all&#13;
year round, but there is some variation in the pattern due&#13;
to seasonal factors and regional differences.   This type of&#13;
production structure gives rise to a large and expanding&#13;
pool of labor in the agricultural sector which will lead&#13;
eventually to a higher level of rural and urban underem-&#13;
ployment."2/&#13;
1.10      The position set out in the above report and Plan document has also&#13;
been fully reflected in analysis of social profitability for projects in the&#13;
rural sector. A UN study 3/ of returns in irrigated agriculture covering&#13;
projects in all regions of the country heavily discounted labor costs. In the&#13;
Northeast of Thailand, a zero accounting wage rate was used in projects in Phi&#13;
Mai, Ubon and Nongkhai whlle a positive accounting wage was used only during the&#13;
peak tranisplanting and harvest times in areas served by tank reservoirs at&#13;
Chorakhe, Muk Haaj Talaat, and Lam Phok. In areas served by the Nan River Basin&#13;
development in Utteradit and Phitsanulok Changwads in Northern Thailand, a zero&#13;
shadow wage rate was used for agricultural labor except for the wet season&#13;
harvest period. In the Nae Klong irrigation project in West Central Thailand,&#13;
shiadow wage rates were positive but labor outside peak seasons was priced at one&#13;
third the rate used for labor in peak seasons. In the Pattani project area in&#13;
South Thailand, a zero accounting price of labor was used for all periods. In a&#13;

recent Government feasibility study of the Northern Chao Phya irrigation project&#13;
in the Central Region 1/; a zero accounting wage was assumed for unskilled labor&#13;
(although sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the impact of positive&#13;
labor costs). In a World Bank feasibility study of the Northern Chao Phya&#13;
irrigation system, an accounting wage at least one fifth the market wage was&#13;
applied to off peak season labor requirements "to reflect the severe unemploy-&#13;
ment of farm labor."2/ Costing labor at 10 baht a day (U. S. 50 cents, a low&#13;
wage for the Central Plain) would have reduced the internal rate of return from&#13;
15% to 6% in this instance. The assumption that the accounting price of labor&#13;
is one fifth of market wages outside the peak season has also been used in World&#13;
Bank appraisals for projects to improve irrigation in the Northeast. 3/&#13;
1.11      In addition to discounting labor costs in public sector projects, the&#13;
alleged rural labor surplus has been an important factor in the design of rural&#13;
sector programs on the part of the Thai Government. An example is a massive but&#13;
short lived public works program which allocated 2.5 and 3.5 billion baht&#13;
(US$125 million and $175 million) into rural projects in fiscal year 1975 and&#13;
1976 respectively. While there were political factors involved in the program,&#13;
the surplus labor concept played an important role with most projects designed&#13;
for implementation in the dry season using labor intensive techniques so as to&#13;
reduce alleged underemployment.&#13;
1.12      Notwithstanding the widespread adherence to a "l&amp; zr surplus" descrip-&#13;
tion of the rural Thai economy, the empirical evidence for the main tenets of the&#13;
hypoth -is appears very weak.&#13;

4/ A series of rural employment surveys have been interpreted as supporting the&#13;
surplus labor hypothesis for rural Thailand. Despite participation rates&#13;
equal to or above 74% for these regions, unemployment rates were 0% in the&#13;
North, 0.28% in the Northeast, and 1.03% in the South. The implication of&#13;
large unemployment or underemployment has been drawn from the number "agri-&#13;
culturalists" reporting "no work" and "part-time work," and full-time work&#13;
"in purely agricultural activities' by months. The annual average of those&#13;
reporting "no work" and "part-time work" was 21.5% and 14.4% in the Northeast,&#13;
24.7% and 22.6% in the North, and 10.5% and 28.3% in the South. In the slack&#13;
dry season months of March and April in the North and Northeast, half the re-&#13;
spondents were reporting "no work." These responses, however, reflect both the&#13;
high proportions of females (almost one-half) and are engaged in "purely agri-&#13;
cultural activities" only in the peak planting and harvesting season and volun-&#13;
tarily withdraw from labor force activities in other periods and the sizable&#13;
proportion of rural labor time in Thailand that is engaged in non-agricultural&#13;
activities; evidence for which is presented in the text. For a more detailed&#13;
discussion of these surveys, see Bertrand, The Rural Sector in Thailand, AGREP&#13;

is no evidence of significant open unemployment in rural Thailand. Unemployment&#13;
for all regions of the country and for both the wet and dry seasons has typically&#13;
been well be ow 1% of the labor force.1/ This is so even after 1973 when the&#13;
definition of unemployed workers was broadened so as to include both unpaid&#13;
family members working less than 20 hours a week who wanted to work more and&#13;
persons not looking for work because of their belief that jobs were not available&#13;
along with those actively seeking employment. This absence of open unemployment&#13;
is especially noteworthy as labor force participation rates for both males and&#13;
especially females in THailand are among the highest in Asia.&#13;
1.14      Although there is little open unemployment in rural Thailand, there&#13;
is a significant change in labor utilization patterns between the peak and&#13;
slack agricultural seasons. The aggregate labor force data for rural areas&#13;
are presented in Table 1. 2/ The most interesting aspect of this table is the&#13;
variation in the labor force between the two survey periods, corresponding&#13;
to the dry (January-March) and rainy (July-September) seasons for most of&#13;
the country.3/ In 1974, there is a substantial difference in the size of the&#13;
labor force between the two seasons, with the rainly season labor force 30%&#13;
larger than the dry season labor force for the country as a whole. This&#13;
variation is most pronounced in the Northeast with a 49% difference and in&#13;
the North with a 31% difference and has been cited as evidence that a labor&#13;
surplus exists, at least as a seasonal phenomenon. A similar pattern is&#13;
observed in the data for 1975 and in 1976. A significant contraction in the&#13;
rural labor force during the dry season, allowing for normal inter-period&#13;
growth in the labor force, is however, not apparent in the 1971-73 data for any&#13;
region. Since dry season employment opportunities have not changed markedly,&#13;
and if anything have improved with increased water control and increased&#13;
1/ Unemployment rates for the labor force in rural areas (non-municipal)&#13;
areas have never been reported above 1% for the whole country and have&#13;
never been above 2% in either the dry or rainy seasons (see National&#13;
Statistical Office, Labor Force Survey, published biannually, for the&#13;
relevant date). The NSO data are based on sample surveys of house-&#13;
holds. The July-September 1976 survey, for instance, covered 8,000&#13;
households in Bangkok, 8,000 households in other municipal areas, and&#13;
8,800 households in non-municipal areas.&#13;
2/ The data for non-municipal areas excludes all provincial capitals, all&#13;
cities with a population of at least 10,000 and a population density&#13;
of at least 3,000 per square kilometer. In 1975, the non-municipal&#13;
areas accounted for 85% of Thailand's population and less than 5% of&#13;
the municipal labor force were classified as employed in agriculture,&#13;
forestry, hunting, and fishing. Data for non-municipal areas there-&#13;
fore correspond closely to rural areas. The data reflect an adjust-&#13;
ment for 1973 in response to a post numeration survey which found&#13;
that 1970 census undernumerated the total population by 2.01% (3.27%&#13;
for municipal areas and 1.44% for non-municipal areas). See Insti-&#13;
tute of Population Studies, Perspective on Thai Population, Chulalong-&#13;
horn University.&#13;
3/ A sharp distinction between the dry and rainy seasons exists for all but&#13;
the South; a region that accounts for 12% of the Thai population.&#13;

increased cultivation of upland annual crops, the variation in the 1974 labor&#13;
force appears to be a consequence of the change in labor force definitions after&#13;
1973 whereby family members working less than 20 hours but not seeking additional&#13;
work were classified as out of the labor force.&#13;
1.15      The nature of the shift in the structure of the labor force is&#13;
clarified by data on participation rates by region and by age groups presented&#13;
in Table 2. There is some decline in participation rates evident between the&#13;
rainy season in the post 1973 data compared to generally stable rates during&#13;
the 1971-73 period but the most striking changes occur in the dry season&#13;
rates. For males, the 1974 dry season rates are 18% and 15% below the 1973&#13;
rate in the North and Northeast respectively compared to a corresponding 7&#13;
and 1 percentage fall in the r;ainy season rates. For females, the 1974 dry&#13;
season participation rates are 18, 24 and 18 percentage points below the 1973&#13;
rates in the North, Northeast, and South respectively compared to a correspond-&#13;
ing decline of 2, 0 and 2 percentage points in the rainy season. The age&#13;
group data indicate that these changes in the dry season are mainly due to&#13;
sharp reductions in participation rates for young males and for women of all&#13;
age groups. The declines are particularly large for the two youngest age&#13;
groups of both sexes. The participation rate for children from 11 to 14 is&#13;
cut in half for both girls and boys and declines by 34 and 25 percentage&#13;
points respectively for males and females in their late teens (from 15-19).&#13;
This change in labor force activity by youngsters after the change in the&#13;
classification of family workers with less than a 20 hour work week is crucial&#13;
since 23% of the male and 27% of the female dry season rural labor force in 1973&#13;
were in the two youngest age groups. The dry season participation rates for&#13;
males above 20 show some decline, but the change is relatively minor and some&#13;
increases are also observed. The pattern first established in 1974 is again&#13;
also observed in the 1975 and 1976 data.&#13;
1.16      The high rainy season participation rates and the importance of&#13;
female workers and youngsters in the declines in the dry season rates suggest&#13;
that the aggregate labor force data give little support to the labor surplus&#13;
hypothesis. The labor force expands in response to heavy demands for labor&#13;
in on-farm act'vities during the rainy season by drawing on females and&#13;
youngsters who in the great majority of cases are not engaged in dry season&#13;
off-farm employment by choice.l/&#13;
1.17      The tightness in rural labor markets in the rainy season is also&#13;
reflected in labor force survey data on work hours. Despite the high propor-&#13;
tions of females (with household duties not counted as labor force activity)&#13;
and youngsters in the rainy season labor force, over a quarter of the rainy&#13;
season labor force averaged over a 70 hour work week. Since most of these&#13;
farm activities require daylight, this means that sizable segments of the&#13;
labor force were literally working all the time durLng the peak seasons.&#13;
These long peak season work weeks tend to counterbalance the shorter dry&#13;
1/ Note that family workers working less than 20 hours who want to work&#13;
more and those not looking for work because of the belief that it is not&#13;
available remain classified in the labor force as unemployed. The&#13;
"choice" to drop out of the labor force is a function of the available&#13;
returns in employment and the decline in labor force participation is&#13;
much less in areas with higher slack season wage rates.&#13;

work weeks resulting in annual work hours that are not very different from work&#13;
norms in the developed economies. There is however, some evidence that the&#13;
seasonal variations in labor utilization are greatest in the poorest regions of&#13;
the country--the North and the Northeast. In the North in 1973, 47% of the male&#13;
labor force in agriculture worked less than 30 hours a week in the dry season&#13;
while 35% worked more than 70 hours a week in the rainy season. In 1974 in the&#13;
Northeast, 42% of the male labor force in agriculture worked less than 30 hours&#13;
per week while 32% worked more than 70 hour weeks in the rainy season. Village&#13;
studies show lower average annual work hours in the Northeast, but at levels&#13;
that are close to work norms in developed economies. Similar studies for&#13;
villages in other parts of the country indicate higher work hours on an annual&#13;
basis with a less severe 20-25% reduction in hours worked during February&#13;
through June dry season. 1/&#13;
Non-Farm Employment Opportunities&#13;
1.18      A further adjustment to the seasonality of agriculture in Thailand&#13;
occurs through a dry season expansion in non-agricultural activities; mainly&#13;
in manufacturing, construction, commerce and services. The latter factor is&#13;
clarified by the labor force data by production sector Table 3. The employment&#13;
share of agriculture is generally some five percentage points lower in the&#13;
dry season prior to the 1974 change -- labor force definitions and about 13&#13;
perceatage points afterwards. While the employment gains in manufacturing&#13;
and construction in the dry season are in the hundreds of thousands (255&#13;
thousand in 1975 and 274 thousand in 1976) compared to the decline in agricul-&#13;
tural employment in the millions in agriculture (3 million in 1975 and 4.4&#13;
million in 1976), this must be interpreted in the context of the importance&#13;
of females and youngsters in the labor force. A quarter of a million addi-&#13;
tional jobs in non-agricultural activities in the dry season is sizable&#13;
relative to che declines that take place in male post-teenage labor force&#13;
activity in agriculture.&#13;
1.19      The importance of non-agricultural activities is also indicated&#13;
by detailed studies of labor utilization in selected villages. Non-agricul-&#13;
tural activities typically account for some one-third of labor time in the&#13;
rainy season and two-thirds of labor time in the dry season. 2/ Studies in&#13;
1/ Based on a 40 hour-50 week work year, with 20% of the labor force given a&#13;
norm based on half-time work to allow for the high proportion of children&#13;
in the labor force, data from a National Economic and Social Development&#13;
Board study indicate that villages in the Northeast are from 8% to 17%&#13;
below this norm while villages in the Central Plan and North are 37% to&#13;
43% above the norm. This data is responsed in Somchai Sunkool, Methodo-&#13;
logy of Measuirng Unemployment: With Special Reference to the Agricultural&#13;
Economy of Thailand 1969-70, M. A. Thesis, Thomaset University, June 1963.&#13;
2/ Agricultural activities accounted for 42%, 50%, and from 51-55% of&#13;
labor time in Central Plain, Northern, and Northeastern villages covered&#13;
by a National Economic and Social Development Board Survey reported on in&#13;
Somchai Sunkool, ibid. Off-farm labor time accounted for 34% of male&#13;
labor and 61% of female labor in Northern villages as reported in Thodey&#13;
and Laramee, Ban Pa Mark, Northern Thailand: Results of a Daily Record&#13;
Keeping Study, 1973-74, Chungmai University, December 1974.&#13;

the North covering both land holdings with single and with double cropping&#13;
capability are especially noteworthy. If the "underemployment because of&#13;
agricultural slack" thesis has much relevance in Thailand, it would certainly&#13;
imply that underemployment would be concentrated among those farmers with land&#13;
that cannot support high crop intensities. It is just the opposite with ob-&#13;
served work hours significantly greater among single cropping farmers due to&#13;
higher off-farm employment. Since income levels are higher on double cropped&#13;
farms, these data reflect positive income elasticities of demand for leisure and&#13;
are inconsistent with the main tenets of the under employment thesis. 1/&#13;
1.20      Data on incomes by source also show substantial importance of non-&#13;
agricultural activities for farm families in Thailand 2/ After accounting&#13;
for non-cash income comprised mainly of agricultural goods produced for on-&#13;
farm consumption, non-agricultural incomes account on average for a quarter&#13;
to almost a half of total income. These high levels rf non-agricultural&#13;
incomes are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis of severely limited&#13;
employment opportunities during the slack agricultural period.&#13;
Hired Farm Labor&#13;
1.21      The lack of a year round labor surplus on farms is also indicated&#13;
by the significance of hired labor, especially in areas with some double cropp-&#13;
ing potential.3/ In the Northern Chao Phya region, for instance, more than half&#13;
1/  The data are reported in Tongsiri, Lertamrab, and Thodey, Agro-economic&#13;
Characteristics of the Chiengmai Valley 1972-73, Chungmai Uni7ersity,&#13;
January 1975. Farm families on small single-cropped farms had per&#13;
capita incomes 17% below those on small double-cropped farms but had&#13;
labor inputs per full-time worker that were 31% higher in the rainy sea-&#13;
son and 40% higher in the dry season. Farm families on medium-sized&#13;
single-cropped farms had per capita incomes 8% below those on medium-sized&#13;
double-cropped farms but had labor inputs per full-time worker that were&#13;
27% higher in the rainy season and 9% higher in the dry season. Farm fam-&#13;
ilies on large single-cropped farms had per capita incomes 14% below those&#13;
on large double-cropped farms but had labor inputs per full-time worker&#13;
that were 24% higher in the rainy season and 10% higher in the dry season.&#13;
2/  Data from Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Agricultural Statistics&#13;
of Thailand, 1975-76, Tables 94 and 95, indicate that some 40% of net&#13;
cash income in the average farm household in Thailand was derived from&#13;
non-agricultural activities, varying from 53% in the Northeast and South&#13;
to between 27% and 32% for other parts of the country. Using cash income&#13;
to total income ratios by region reported in National Statistical Office,&#13;
Socio-Economic Survey, 1968/69, non-agricultural incomes on the average&#13;
are calculated to account for 24%, 28%, 32%, and 43%, of total income in&#13;
the North, Central, Northeast, and Southern regions of the country.&#13;

of farm labor requirements in rice production are supplied by hired labor&#13;
compared to the 30-40% ratio observed prior to the introduction of double&#13;
cropping. Hired labor accounted for 52% of labor inputs in rubber production in&#13;
areas covered by a 13 Changwad survey in the South and for 92% of labor inputs in&#13;
sugar cane production (although the ratio was lower in smaller sized farms).&#13;
Ratios for upland crops tend to be lower with some crops (such as cassava)&#13;
usually not requiring hired labor on most holdings.l/&#13;
Wage Rates&#13;
1.22      Wage rate movements should be a primary source of information on&#13;
labor market conditions. Unfortunately, rural wage rate data are not systema-&#13;
tically collected. 2/ The data that are available show considerable stability&#13;
in nominal and real wages from 1965 and 1972 with significant increases observed&#13;
after 1972. These latter changes reflect favorable developments in many agri-&#13;
cutural markets. Rubber prices in the South, even after a decrease from the&#13;
peak prices of 1974, were higher in real terms than in the 1960's. A similar&#13;
factor was operating in the East and Western parts of the Central region during&#13;
the 1973-76 boom in sugar prices. Farm prices for rice more than tripled from&#13;
1970/71 to 1973/74 and, although rice prices have receded somewhat, a rapid&#13;
adjustment in wage rates occurred during the tight labor markets in planting and&#13;
harvesting seasons. Double cropping in the Northern Cbao Phya irrigation area&#13;
expanded rapidly in the 1970s with wage rates responding to the increased demand&#13;
for labor. In the Northeast, labor markets have been affected by a cassava boom&#13;
that has swept the region. The latter is not a labor intensive crop but the&#13;
rapid expansion in areas under cassava, requiring some clearing and establishment&#13;
of drying and processing establishments, led to some increase in the demand for&#13;
labor. Bumper crops in maize and tobacco in 1975 also were important factors in&#13;
the northeast Central Plain, the North, and the Northeast. The Tambol Development&#13;
program put a US$300 million stimulus into the rural sector in the 1975 and 1976&#13;
period. These factors led to an increase of real wages in many parts of the&#13;
country and to adjustments in nominal wages sufficient to prevent declines in&#13;
real wages in the face of inflationary pressures in other areas.&#13;
1/ Data on rubber are from Hunting Technical Service Limited, South Thailand&#13;
Regional Planning Study, Sector Studies, No. 8, Rubber. The data on other crops&#13;
are from unpublished surveys carried out as part of the input-output project at&#13;
the National Economic and Social Development Board, Government of Thailand.&#13;
2/ The landless labor class in rural Thailand is very small. In 1963, only 60,000&#13;
families representing 1.6% of total farm families (3.9 million) were without land,&#13;
see National Statistical Office, Census of Agriculture,1963. Employees in agri-&#13;
cultural activities accounted for less than 5% of the agricultural labor force in&#13;
rural areas of the North and Northeast throughout the 1971-75 period, see&#13;
national Statistical Office, Labor Force Survey. A higher rate is found in&#13;
the more commercialized Central Plain and the South, but even in these areas&#13;
employees accounted for only about 10% of the labor force. Since over 99% of&#13;
the remainder are either self-employed farmers or unpaid family workers, the&#13;
dominance of family labor on family farms is a striking characteristic of the&#13;
Thai rural sector and in sharp contrast to other Asian countries. Self-employed&#13;
workers in agriculture were 75% of the total labor force in Thailand in 1910&#13;
compared to 48% in Indonesia, 47% in the Philippines, 49% in Korea, and 36%&#13;
in West Malaysia, see National Statistical Office, The Utilization of Labor in&#13;
Thailand, 1975&#13;

1.23      Some degree of arbitrariness in the particular wage rates reported&#13;
in Table 4 is unavoidable, particularly for the 1975 and 1976 observations.&#13;
There is considerable wage rate variation for the Northern Chao P'nya area&#13;
where these rates were observed. The 1976 wage is on the dividing line between&#13;
reported agricultural wages ranging fromm 15-30 baht a day in slack seasons to&#13;
30-40 baht in the peak seasons. The 1975 wage is calculated from 1975 piece&#13;
rates for transplanting which led to a range of daily payments from 18 baht a&#13;
day at the beginning of dry season transplanting to 45 baht a day at the peak.&#13;
The 25 baht used in the Table is the mid-point between 20-30 baht range for most&#13;
actual daily payments.  Even correcting for an almost doubling of consumer&#13;
prices, these wages are 50% above the 1965 prices in real terms.&#13;
1.24      The relevance of the wage rate series for other parts of the country&#13;
is also subject to question. For the North, Usher 1/ reports a 6 baht a&#13;
day wage in 1965 while in 1974 farm labor near Chiengmai was paid 15 baht&#13;
a day. 2/ This gives similar changes in real wages as observed in the Central&#13;
Plain. For the Northeast, female labor that was paid 8 baht a day in the mid&#13;
1960's earned 15 baht a day in 1977. Wage rates for unskilled males are in&#13;
the 20-25 baht range compared to 1967 wage rates of 10 to 12 baht. These&#13;
Northeast wages result in fairly constant real wages rather than the increases&#13;
observed in the Central Plain and areas near Chiengmai where rapid growth is&#13;
concentrated. In the South, real wages have increased in rubber areas while&#13;
changing less perceptibly in areas specialized in rice.3/&#13;
1.25      Considerable information is also available on the rural labor market&#13;
from data on the Tambol Development program. 4/ While a wage rate of 18 baht&#13;
a day for unskilled labor was set by the Government, actual wages were&#13;
considerably higher with an average wage of 30 baht and only 7% of a sample&#13;
of 2145 workers earning 18 baht a day. These payments, however, are not a&#13;
reliable guide to the supply price of labor because the projects were often&#13;
viewed as a Government subsidy to the rural sector and there was little&#13;
pressure to minimize project costs or wages. Nevertheless, the data provide&#13;
some interesting information on incomes of the workers in the project.&#13;
Average personnel annual income of participants exclusive of earnings from&#13;
the project itself was 3,300 baht and 65% of the workers had a personal&#13;
annual cash income of over 2,500 baht. Family cash income of participants&#13;
averaged 7,125 baht and was above 5,000 baht for 65% of the workers. Since&#13;
rice is mainly grown for home consumption in Thailand, cash incomes of&#13;
most Thai farmers come from sales of upland crops and from off-farm employ-&#13;
ment. The average worker in the Tambol Development Project had cash income&#13;

levels equal to those of a farmer producing crops for home consumption and&#13;
working off the farm earning 30 baht a day for about 4 months. Given the&#13;
labor requirements in producing crops for home consumption, this is not the&#13;
picture of a seriously underemployed farmer. If cash crops are allowed for,&#13;
the number of months of off-farm employment implied by the data is reduced by&#13;
the time input in farm activities must be increased correspondingly. It is&#13;
difficult to reconcile the cash income figures with the unemployment-under-&#13;
employment hypothesis.&#13;
Choice of Techniques&#13;
1.26      An indirect test of the hypothesis of rising costs of labor is the&#13;
extent to which less labor intensive techniques are being adopted in rural&#13;
areas. Mechanization and some limited adoption of less labor intensive rice&#13;
production provides examples of such a process.&#13;
1.27      While tractors are appearing in increasing numbers in most areas&#13;
of the country, mechanization has been especially widespread in the Central&#13;
Plain and particularly in the double cropping areas in the Northern Chao Phya&#13;
system and in areas to the East of Bangkok. A recent report notes that in&#13;
the Chanasutr area of the Northern Chao Phya irrigation areas,&#13;
"The farmers had to find some solution in order to be able to&#13;
achieve a higher cropping intensity. Firstly, they mechanized&#13;
the land preparation, which was a major obstacle with regard&#13;
to the introduction of double cropping, and later on also trans-&#13;
port and threshing on the paddy .... Secondly, they leased part&#13;
of their land, which they could not cultivate with the available&#13;
family labor. And thirdly, they hired an increasing number of&#13;
laborers, mainly during periods of peak labor demand. 1/&#13;
The extent and rapidity of the mechanization process was striking.   In wet&#13;
season activities in 1972, 40% of the first tillage and 5% of the second&#13;
tillage was done by tractor. By 1974, 90% of the first tillage and 100% of&#13;
the second tillage was by tractor. For the dry season, tractors were used&#13;
in the first tillage on 50% of the land in 1971 compared to 90% in 1974.&#13;
While an extensive land consolidation program and the greatly decreased flexi-&#13;
bility in timing agricultural activities with double cropping have contributed&#13;
to the increased wage rate pressures around Chanasutr, the spread of mechaniza-&#13;
tion was also quite apparent in wide areas of the Central Plain and gives&#13;
indirect evidence to the changing structure of factor costs faced by farmers.&#13;
1.28      A second area where an increase in the cost of labor can be expec-&#13;
ted to have repercussions on techniques of agricultural production is in&#13;
the choice of broadcasting as opposed to transplanting. Transplanting can&#13;
require about 40% more labor than broadcasting 2/ since the process of nursery&#13;

approximately 137 man-hours of labor versus about 94 man-hours for broad-&#13;
casted rice (see Leslie Small, "An Economic Evaluation of the Water Con-&#13;
trol in the Northern Region of the Greater Chao Phya Project of Thailand,"&#13;

bed preparation and transplanting rice seedlings is a major component&#13;
of labor requirements. In the past, rice was transplanted if water controls&#13;
was good and 'floating' varieties were broadcast if rapid flooding was a&#13;
serious problem. 1/ It is not uncommon in areas where water control has&#13;
been improved by irrigation facilities to find a complete shift to transplant-&#13;
ing. 2/ However, biecause of the widely divergent labor requirements in the&#13;
two processes, relative profitability of the two alternatives is also partially&#13;
a function of the cost of labor, and rising labor costs should ceteris paribus&#13;
be reflected in some shift to broadcasting. While very little variation can&#13;
be observed in the broadcasting to transplanting ratios prior to 1970, 3/&#13;
there is evidence that such a process has occurred in certain areas of the&#13;
country in more recent years. The crop cutting survey recorded a decline in&#13;
the ratio of sample farmers transplanting rice from 90% to 81% in the North&#13;
and from 67% to 61% in the Central Plain between 1970 and 1973. 4/ The&#13;
Central Plain figure is interesting since in many areas during this period, an&#13;
opposite shift towards transplanting was known to be occurring in response to&#13;
the improved water control factor.&#13;
1.29      In areas with controlled water supplies, a different type of culti-&#13;
vation whereby sprouted seeds are broadcast directly into the main paddy&#13;
fields and the water level is increased in line with the growth in the seed-&#13;
lings is becoming important. The most important factor in the shift towards&#13;
this type of broadcasting has been the rising cost of labor. This is con-&#13;
firmed in a recent study of rice cultivation in Changwad Chachangsao to the&#13;
East of Bangkok:&#13;
"Most farmers claim that the difficulty in finding hired&#13;
labor and the high cost of labor induced them to aaopt&#13;
broadcasting. It seems that non-farm employment oppor-&#13;
tunities are adequate both in and around Chachangsao.&#13;
There are about 500 or more large and small scale indus-&#13;
tries scattered in Chachangsao  ........ Among these, the&#13;
rice mills, the flour mills, the tractor and machine repair&#13;
shops as well as production factories are most common.&#13;
Nearby provinces along the east coast, such as Chantaburi,&#13;
Rayong, and Cholburi, also probably absorb some of the&#13;
1/   'Floating' varieties elongate rapidly and can survive rapidly rising water&#13;
levels.&#13;
2/ The process is one area is discussed in Somchart Komate, "Labor Problems&#13;
of Double Cropping at Chanasutr Land Consolidation Project", M.A. Thesis,&#13;
Thamasat University, Bangkok, 1976.&#13;
3/   The broadcasting to transplanting ratio fluctuated from 20% to 26%&#13;
between 1955 and 1969 with no apparent trend. (Data on area planted by&#13;
the two methods is available in Yuavares Gaesuwan, Ammar Sumwalla, and&#13;

labor force from Chachangsao. These three provinces are&#13;
famous for their cassava, flour mills, and sugar cane&#13;
factories. Bangkok and Samutprakarn are two other prov-&#13;
inces very close to Chachangsao which provide many kinds&#13;
of unskilled jobs." 1/&#13;
There are no extensive data on changes in techniques and a comprehensive&#13;
analysis cannot be carried out. Nevertheless, the mechanization process&#13;
and adoption of less labor intensive techniques provide supporting evidence&#13;
for the conclusion that unskilled wages rates have been increasing in rural&#13;
Thailand.&#13;
Accounting Wage Rates&#13;
1.30      Many examples of the use of accounting wage rates close to zero or&#13;
at least well below market wage rates were noted at the beginning of this&#13;
section. However, the evidence on labor utilization, the income generation&#13;
process, and market wage rates in rural Thailand does not support the use of&#13;
accounting wage rates below market wage rates. While there is some variation in&#13;
the amount of slack or lack of it in different periods and areas, there is&#13;
little evidence to suggest these differences are not correctly reflected in&#13;
market wage rates. Even if there was no such thing as a labor market to allow&#13;
adjustments in allocating labor time to the point where trade-offs between&#13;
benefits and costs are reflected in market prices, there may literally not be&#13;
one person in Thailand who would accept the trade-offs being proposed in much of&#13;
the accounting price analyses for rural Thailand.&#13;
1.31      Apart from the unemployment-underemployment argument the only signif-&#13;
icant factor leading to adjustment of market wage rates for labor employed in&#13;
the rural sector in Thailand are the distortions to prices for agricultural&#13;
outputs. These product price distortions are often highlighted in accounting&#13;
price analysis, but the implications of this for evaluating the opportunity&#13;
costs of rural labor is often ignored. Since domestic prices for major agri-&#13;
cultural products (rice in all parts of the country and rubber in the South) do&#13;
not reflect the value of output because they neglect the value of resources&#13;
accruing to the Government from heavy taxation there is an a priori expectation&#13;
that wage rates reflecting the opportunity cost of labor evaluated at market&#13;
prices understates the costs of labor.&#13;
1.32      One of the great benefits of a properly functioning price system&#13;
is that the alternative use of resources drawn into a project are irrelevant&#13;
to the costing of these resources. Market prices reflect the opportunity&#13;
cost at the margin in all alternative uses. This characteristic does not&#13;
carry over into an economic system where price interferences result in market&#13;
prices that over and under state the value to society of outputs in different&#13;
sectors. In this environment, proper accounting pricing requires knowledge of&#13;
all the resource allocation implications of drawing factors of production&#13;

into the activity under study. In models where prices are fixed and there&#13;
are many commodities relative to factors, these shifts in resources are inde-&#13;
terminate resulting in accounting prices that are neither determinant nor&#13;
subject to any theoretical restrictions whatsoever. 1/ Nevertheless, some&#13;
assumptions about these resource allocation effects may be reasonable enough to&#13;
allow some quantitative guidance in setting these accounting prices. The most&#13;
reliable, or least unreliable, assumption for labor use in rural Thailand is&#13;
that it is eventually reflected in changes in the number of barely commercialized&#13;
farmers on marginal lands in the agricultural sector. The returns of these&#13;
farmers evaluated at product market prices is a rough index of the supply price&#13;
of labor reflected in market wage rates and the returns to these farmers evaluated&#13;
at accounting prices approximates the accounting price of labor. Since the weight&#13;
given to rice production by the non-commercial farmer rotughly corresponds&#13;
to the weight given to rice in the consumption bundle of low income households&#13;
(an implication of the limited commercial activity in the marginal agricultural&#13;
households), an approximation to the required upward adjustment is given by&#13;
the difference in wages required to maintain constant real income in low income&#13;
households. During the 1960's, the percentage difference between domestic and&#13;
world market rice prices was in the range from 150% to 200%. 2/ The socio-economic&#13;
surveys indicates that rice accounts for from 15% to 23% of rural household&#13;
expenditures. 3/ This leads to upward adjustments in price indexes weighted by&#13;
either consumption expenditures or household output for low income groups in the&#13;
rural areas of from 22% to 46%. This, then, is the range of reasonable adjustments&#13;
required to obtain accounting wage rates from market wage rates due to the price&#13;
affects of export taxation on rice. Since the percentage distortions in rice&#13;
prices have been less substantial in the 1970's except for the boom 1974-75&#13;
years, a significant lower adjustment is required in most of the 1970's. A 16%&#13;
adjustment has been used when     adjusting labor costs in the accounting price&#13;
analysis carried out in this study.&#13;
An Overview&#13;
1.33      The data on labor utilization in the rural areas of Thailand has&#13;
been seriously misinterpreted and the extent of underemployment grossly exag-&#13;
gerated. Nevertheless, there is considerable evidence that the level of work&#13;
effort does vary across households by income levels and by regions between&#13;
which noticeable differences in wage rates are observed. The focus of future&#13;
research should be on analyzing the behavior of the farm household in a frame-&#13;
work in which both the income are price effects can be accounted for. While&#13;
labor is utilized at high rates through much of the year in the rural sector&#13;
of Thailand, many of the activities have low returns. One can be confident,&#13;
especially in the less commercialized regions of the country, that the elasti-&#13;
city of supply of labor is high during much of the year. It is a confidence&#13;
1/   This argument is fully developed in Trent J. Bertrand, "On Shadow Pricing&#13;
in Scaled Economies", American Economic Review, December 1979.&#13;
2/   This statement is based on comparisons of monthly price data for 5% rice&#13;
from 1961 to 1972 that is available from the Board of Trade.&#13;
3/   See, for instance, NSO, Socio-economic Survey, 1971-73, p. 27 where the&#13;
weight to rice is reported as 22.6% in the Northeast and 15.8% in the North.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
that is supported by the observed response in the labor market to the higher&#13;
returns in the peak agricultural seasons and by the response of Thai farm&#13;
families to more attractive employment opportunities in the more commercialized&#13;
areas of the country. The behavior of households in Thailand in response to&#13;
economic opportunities appears to be, in general, well described by households&#13;
maximizing real income subject to constraints provided by physical (mainly&#13;
land) and human assets operating in reasonably competitive markets.&#13;
B. Land in Rural Thailand&#13;
1.34      In this section, changes in land area under cultivation and the&#13;
patterns of land utilization will be described. This allows a better under-&#13;
standing of changing tenure relationships, provides the background information&#13;
required to understand Government policies towards the agricultural sector, and&#13;
clarifies the prospect for further growth through expansion of land under&#13;
cultivation and the potential and implications of an alternative process more&#13;
heavily based on an expanded irrigation infrastructure with greater use of&#13;
improved seed varieties and chemical inputs.&#13;
Land Utilization in Rural Thailand&#13;
1.35      The most important developments in agriculture in the post World&#13;
War II period have been (a) the rapid growth in cultivated areas and (b) the&#13;
importance of upland crops relative to rice in this process - especially maize,&#13;
kenaf, cassava, and rubber. While agricultural statistics from different&#13;
sources often contain inconsistencies, 1/ these characteristics are evident in&#13;
virtually all statistical reports on the Thai economy.&#13;
1.36      The growth in planted area in the 14 most important crops in the&#13;
1950s was not spectacular (Table 5); a 20% increase being recorded from 1950 to&#13;
1960. However, the main characteristics of the post World War II agricultural&#13;
growth are evident. Expansion of planted area in rice was only 7% while planted&#13;
area in the export-oriented crops -- maize, kenaf, cassava, and mungbeans grew&#13;
from 551 thousand rai to 3,436 thousand rai. Substantial growth also took place&#13;
in the sugar cane sector, a 193% growth being recorded between 1950 and 1960.&#13;
1/   While these inconsistencies can not be fully investigated here, some&#13;
examples are useful to indicate the nature of the problems: (a) the NS0&#13;
census of agriculture estimates for the 1962-63 crop year showed a con-&#13;
siderably lower output for many crops compared to Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
data - 59% lower for cotton, 55% lower for kenaf, 70% lower for tobacco,&#13;
50% lower for soybeans, 61% lower for castor beans, 86% lower for chili,&#13;
43% lower for groundnuts, and 55% lower for cassava (see J. Ingram, Economic&#13;
Change in Thailand 1850-1970, Stanford 1970, p. 240 for the output estimates);&#13;
(b) the rice output estimates from the NS0 crop cutting surveys in 1966, 1967,&#13;
and 1968 were above the Ministry of Agriculture's Rice Department estimates&#13;
by 13%, 16%, and 21% respectively; (c) an aerial photo survey in 1966 implied&#13;
that rubber areas were 70% greater than reported in the Census of Agriculture&#13;
(see FAO/UNDP, Survey of Rubber Growing Areas: An Agricultural Economic Study,&#13;
AGP: DP/THA/70/534 Technical Report, 1973, p. 15-19); and (d) the paddy land&#13;
reported in data on land utilization by the Ministry of Agriculture for 1975-&#13;
1976 was 30% greater than area planted reported for rice by the same Ministry&#13;
for the same year. These are examples of some the more notable discrepancies,&#13;
and should not be interpreted as representative.&#13;

The slow growth of rice and rapid growth of the export oriented crops continued&#13;
to be the main characteristic of the sector in the post 1960 period with the&#13;
important difference that total cultivated area expanded at a more rapid rate.&#13;
Planted area in major crops grew by 25% in the first half of the 1960s, by 20%&#13;
in the second half of the 1960s, and by 22% in the first half of the 1970s -&#13;
rates of growth more than double those of the 1950s. The growth in area planted&#13;
in rice was well below the average in the early 1960s (10% growth) but noticeably&#13;
increased over the more recent decade (14% growth from 1965 to 1970 and 19%&#13;
growth from 1970 to 1975). Maize production grew rapidly through this period -&#13;
doubling from 1960 to 1965, growing 44% from 1965 to 1970, and another 50% from&#13;
1970 to 1975. Kenaf grew at an extremely high rate during the early 1960s,&#13;
remained roughly stable until the mid 1970s then declined rapidly. Cassava grew&#13;
slowly in the early 1960s, but then more than doubled in the late 1960s, and&#13;
more than doubled again in the early 1970s. With removal of restrictions on&#13;
cassava (discussed in section II), very high rate of growth continued into the&#13;
1976-77 period. The mungbean crop grew at a moderate rate in the 1950s, doubled&#13;
in the early 1960s, almost doubled again in the late 1960s, but then declined in&#13;
the 1970s. Sugarcane also contributed to the rapid diversification of the Thai&#13;
economy. Sugarcane area almost tripled in the 1950s, stagnated in the 1960s,&#13;
and then almost tripled again in the early 1970s.&#13;
1.37      The nature of the diversification process and the role of agricul-&#13;
tural tax and subsidy policies in the process will be considered in detail&#13;
in section II. It should be noted that rice, the most heavily taxed sector&#13;
in the country, experienced a relative decline throughout the post war period.&#13;
The share of paddy land in total cultivated area declined from 88% in 1950 to&#13;
79% in 1960 to 68% in 1965 to 65% in 1975. 1/&#13;
1.38      Regional specialization characterizes many crops.    In 1974, 76% of all&#13;
maize production was accounted for by 9 Central Changwats, 92% of all cassava&#13;
was accounted for by 6 Changwats in the Northeast and East, 92% of all kenaf was&#13;
accounted for by 9 changwats in the Northeast, and 77% of all sugar cane was&#13;
accounted for by 6 Changwats, mainly in the East and West.&#13;
1.39      International trade has had a profound impact on the growth of agri-&#13;
culture in Thailand. This of course was true for the pre-World War II economy&#13;
with 50% of rice production being exported in the late 1930s. However, foreign&#13;
markets for rice have become relat±vely less important with less than 6% of&#13;
total production being exported in 1975. However, the importances of foreign&#13;
markets have been crucial in the shift into upland crops - in 1965-67 for&#13;
instance, 94% of maize virtually all cassava, 95% of rubber, and 69% of kenaf&#13;
and jute was exported. 2/&#13;

1.40      Table 5 also contains evidence on yields in Thai agriculture.   This&#13;
clarifies the importance of changes in area under cultivation in Thai agricultural&#13;
growth. Yields on rubber, kenaf, groundnuts, soybeans, mungbeans, castor beans,&#13;
and soy beans were all lower in 1975 than in 1960. While maize yields improved&#13;
in the 1960s, they have deteriorated in the 1970s. Coconut yields have declined&#13;
steadily since the mid-1960s. While cassava yields have grown rapidly, this is&#13;
a function of the rapid shift to virgin soils. Without the use of more chemical&#13;
intensive processes, cassava yields fall substantially with repeated cropping on&#13;
the same soils. Rice yields have reversed a steady decline showm in official&#13;
statistics 1/ over the first half of the century. The gains recorded in Table 5&#13;
reflect improved water control and some changes in techniques with greater use&#13;
of mechanization, fertilizer, and improved seed varieties in limited areas of&#13;
the country. The recorded decline in rubber is in line with expectations as&#13;
the rubber area includes all trees (those that are marginally worth tapping,&#13;
those that have been abandoned, and those not yet yielding latex). However, the&#13;
scope for improved yields is good as high yielding clones are spreading under a&#13;
replanting program.&#13;
1.41      While the growth in cultivated area has been the primary factor&#13;
in agricultural expansion in the past, it should be noted that (a) this process&#13;
has to some extent been socially costly as reserve forest and watershed areas&#13;
have been affected and (b) there is an apparent widespread belief that the&#13;
process will soon grind to a halt as the land frontier is closed. While neither&#13;
of these propositions are analyzed in detail in this report, some points should&#13;
be kept in mind in interpreting them.&#13;
1.42      An air photo survey in 1963 showed that forests covered some 57%&#13;
of thie total land area. A satellite census in 1974 showed that forest areas&#13;
had been reduced to only 37% of total land area. In just 13 years, 63 million&#13;
rai of forest (representing 20% of the 1963 forest area) had been cut down. 2/&#13;
The common process is for illegal loggers to clear the area of select trees.&#13;
Then squatters move on to the land completing the deforestation process with&#13;
slash and burn techniques. Unfortunately the social cost results not only&#13;
from the deforestation itself but also in the lack of optimal land utiliza-&#13;
tion afterwards. In some areas, squatters tend to plant fast yielding crops&#13;
with no concern for maintaining the productive capacity of land they will&#13;
soon abandon. This process is particularly costly in the South in areas where&#13;
upland rice, maize, and cassava is planted instead of the high yield clonal&#13;
rubber for which prospects are so bright given the favorable shift in relative&#13;
costs of production for natural and synthetic rubber. Even if rubber is grown,&#13;
until recently this has consisted mainly of low yield traditional varieties&#13;
obtained from neighbors. New planters have limited access to the high yield&#13;
material both because they are often illegal and because the replanting program&#13;
introducing high yield rubber in the south is directed at existing holders. 3/&#13;

1.43      The potential for further expansion in cultivated area is very con-&#13;
troversial. Many statements suggesting a constraint on land areas could be&#13;
brought together, 2/ but this would contribute little more to the debate than&#13;
to warn that present predictions of an end to the process may turn out to be as&#13;
far off the mark as past writings. A recent study of land capability concluded&#13;
less than one quarter of the land suitable for paddy is being cultivated. 2/&#13;
While this estimate cannot be evaluated here, it at least suggests that the&#13;
fixed land description shouldn't be accepted without further research.&#13;
Land Tenure in Thailand&#13;
1.44      The prevalent view on land tenure in the rural sector of Thailand&#13;
is that starting from a historical base with farmers cultivating the land they&#13;
owned, there has been a steady trend toward economic hardship, indebtedness&#13;
and loss of land. From writings on the tenure question, it seems that the&#13;
problem is most severe in the Central Plain;&#13;
"In response to new opportunities for profits, land spe-&#13;
culation on the part of the urban strata developed and&#13;
ownership of rice lands passed increasingly and irrever-&#13;
sible out of the local rural community." 3/&#13;
"The seriousness of the problem is reflected officially&#13;
in a recent Thai government proposal for land reform in&#13;
the Central Plain region, in an effort to reverse the&#13;
tendency towards large farms and a growing tenant class&#13;
which have followed from the capitalization of agricul-&#13;
ture." 4/&#13;
"The plight of the tenant farmers, especially in the&#13;
Central Region, was deteriorating, particularly through&#13;

tional and emerging problems of Thai agriculture differ&#13;
from region to region but the vast majority of the popu-&#13;
lation live in the Central Plains area and the North&#13;
where the problems are most acute." 1/&#13;
The severity of the land tenancy problem in rural Thailand is, however, greatly&#13;
exaggerated by these statements. The misunderstanding is largely the result of&#13;
an attempt to draw inferences from changes in farmer ownership-rental ratios for&#13;
agricultural land independently of the changes that have been occuring in total&#13;
land under cultivation. A misinterpretation of the nature of many rent contracts&#13;
adds to the problem. Since the concern on the tenancy question has been centered&#13;
on the recent past, our focus of attention will be the past decade and a half.&#13;
1.45      In Table 6, data is reported on area owned and area rented as a&#13;
percent of total area in agricultural holdings. These percentages do not add&#13;
to 100 as Thai land tenure data includes an 'other' classification which mainly&#13;
captures land in newly found holdings prior to the establishment of legal&#13;
claim. 2,! This data provides the most comprehensive picture that is presently&#13;
available with a detailed regional breakdown on land tenure relationships&#13;
that is more informative than the four region classification used in most Gov-&#13;
ernment reports. 3/ This table also contains the results which form the basis&#13;
for the "serious tenancy problem" thesis in Thailand. While the total country&#13;
figures do not register a change, the area owned by farmers as a proportion&#13;
of the total land in agricultural holdings has decreased between 1963 and 1971&#13;
in 7 of the 10 regions. In most areas the drop has been substantial--ten&#13;
percentage points or more in the rural areas near Bangkok, the West, and the&#13;
Upper Central Plain, and five percentage points or more in the East, North-&#13;
Northeast, and East Northeast. The areas where land ownership ratios have&#13;
increased (the North, Near Northeast, and South) are all areas where the&#13;
amount of land classified in the 'other' category was substantial in 1963.&#13;
Moreover, the share of the area under rental contracts has increased substan-&#13;
tially in each and every region of the country. The area rented has reached&#13;
significant proportions (15% or above) throughout the broadly defined Cen-&#13;
tral Plain 4/ and in the North. The increase in the Lower Central Plain has&#13;
resulted in a third of the land not being owned by the farmers cultivating&#13;
it. For the total country, tenancy was minor in 1963 (3.6%) but this share&#13;
tripled by 1971 (11.9%).&#13;
1/   Sein Lin and Bruce Esposito, "Agrarian Reform in Thailand:   Problems&#13;
and Prospects", Pacific Affairs, Fall 1976, pp. 425-26. Lin and Esposito&#13;
are incorrect on their population figures; the Central Plain and the&#13;
North contained 43% of the farm population in 1971. The broadly defined&#13;
Central Plain contains 30% of the farm population, not the 80% suggested&#13;
by Lin and Esposito.&#13;

ment has declared as reserve area.&#13;

1.48      While the data shown in Table 6 might support inferences of a&#13;
severe problem in a farm community with a fixed land economy, any such&#13;
inference is suspect in a country where expansion in area under cultivation&#13;
was the dominant characteristic of agricultural growth over the past decade.&#13;
The areas in agricultural holdings by the ten region breakdown for both 1963&#13;
and 1971 along with the percentage change that has occurred between these two&#13;
dates are presented in Table 7. Total land in agricultural holdings has&#13;
increased by 36% during this period for the country as a whole. The regional&#13;
breakdown shows either a decline or very little increase in the Bangkok&#13;
regions and the area immediately to the East and to the North of the Capital&#13;
(the Lower Central Plain). These are areas of long settlement where the&#13;
location of industrial activities has been concentrated. Little change is&#13;
also recorded for the South where considerable abandonment of rubber occurred&#13;
due to the aging of trees and low rubber prices. In all other regions of the&#13;
country, land in agricultural holdings increased by at least a third, by&#13;
almost one half in the Upper Central Plain and the East-Northeast, by almost&#13;
two th:.rds in the Near Northeast, and by almost twofold in the North-Northeast.&#13;
1.47      In Table 7, the farm population is also given by the ten region&#13;
breakdown. The most striking result is that in every region, except the&#13;
Lower Central Plan and the South, the growth in land under cultivation has&#13;
been greater than the growth in the farm population. I/ The implications of&#13;
this for the land tenancy problem is best brought out in Table 8. The first&#13;
two columns of the table show the amount of cultivated land per head of&#13;
agricultural population in both 1963 and 1971. There has been a substantial&#13;
increase in land per head of farm population in every region but the Lower&#13;
Central Plain and South. It should also be noted that while there has been a&#13;
decline in the Lower Central Plain, this decline has been very small and the&#13;
land to farm population ratio is still higher than any other region in the&#13;
country save for the Upper Central Plain. The second two columns are of&#13;
special interest in light of the conventional wisdom on the question. The&#13;
land owned by the farmer working it per head of agricultural population,&#13;
despite the dramatic increases in rental ratios reported in Table 6, has&#13;
increased in every region except the Lower Central Plain. Since the Lower&#13;
Central Plain accounts for less than 9% of total area in agricultural holdings&#13;
and less than 8% of total farm population, the minor decrease recorded in&#13;
this one region should be kept in proper perspective with the overall expansion&#13;
in land assets owned by farmers in every region of the nation (except Bangkok) 2/,&#13;
an expansion that has increased the the average amount of land per farm&#13;
population for the country as a whole by 22%.&#13;
1.48      While the data on land tenure patterns does not indicate any trend&#13;
towards loss of land by the farmers cultivating it, there is data available&#13;
1/   This is a continuation of a long trend in Thailand. In 1937, area in&#13;
farms amounted to 29.4 million rai with a total population of 14.5 mil-&#13;
lion. Using the percent of the labor force in agriculture (89%) as a&#13;
proxy for the percent of population in rural areas, farm area per farm&#13;
population was 2.26 rai per head in 1937 compared to 2.96 in 1963 and&#13;
3.62 in 1971. Calculations based on data from the Census of Agriculture,&#13;
1937 and Census of Population, 1937.&#13;
2/   Even in Bangkok, area owned per head of farm population increased.&#13;

at the district level that allow detailed analysis of the land transfer&#13;
process. While this data has remained largely untouched in the analysis of&#13;
tenure questions, Stifle 1/ has sampled six villages in two Changwats in the&#13;
Central Plain (Ayutthaya and Nakorn Pathom) for the period 1910 to 1972. Even&#13;
if the extreme assumption is made that any transfer of land beyond a rate&#13;
predicted by normal intergenerational transfers represents an involuntary&#13;
loss of land due to economic distress, this loss during the 1910-1972 period&#13;
exceeded 2% per annum only in the depression period 1925-1934 and in the&#13;
immediate post war years 1945-49 and has never exceeded 5% per annum. Since&#13;
many sales of land can be expected to occur voluntarily in the expectation of&#13;
financial gain, even the low rates of intergenerational transfers exaggerates&#13;
any land problem. The transfer of land through mortgage foreclosures or&#13;
failure to exercise repurchase clauses on 'khaaj faak' agreements (a loan in&#13;
the form of a sale of title with a repurchase option specifying price and&#13;
date), accounted for 1.3% of the land only in the depression years 1935-39,&#13;
was below 0.5% of the land in all other periods, and has been below 0.3% in&#13;
all periods since World War II.&#13;
1.49      The ownership shares of the top 20% of landowners were slightly&#13;
higher in 1950 compared to 1930 in five of the six sample villages. Although&#13;
these shares increased in three of the six villages, the changes amotnted to&#13;
less than 6% of the land for both 20 year periods and for all of the villages.&#13;
There is no evidence of a dramatic increase in land concentration among&#13;
wealthy landlords. 2/&#13;
1.50      There is also little evidence of increased indebtedness among&#13;
farmers in these villages. The ratio of land registered as under mortgage or&#13;
'khaaj faak' status has been declining steadily from 11.6% of titled land in&#13;
Nakhon Pathom in 1945 to 7.0% in 1972. The ratio for Ayutthaya increased&#13;
from 4.3% in 1950 to 11.1% in 1960 but then declined steadily to 8.4% in&#13;
1972. Although the statement must be qualified since registration of such&#13;
agreements does not occur in many instances, the data does not indicate the&#13;
dramatic deterioration often suggested.&#13;
1.51      Another element in the tenancy problem thesis is that increased&#13;
land area under rent controls reflects a transfer of ownership to groups in&#13;
urban areas. Stifle defines absentee landlords as landowners outside the&#13;
district (Amphur) where the land is located. There has been a substantial&#13;
jump in such absentee land ownership from the insignificant levels in the&#13;
early 1900s. However, these increases took place prior to 1940 and especially&#13;
during the Great Depression. The proportion of titled land owned by absentee&#13;
landlords rose from 4% in the Ayutthaya villages and 1% in the Nakon Pathom&#13;
villages in 1910 to 12% in Ayutthaya and 5% in Nakon Pathom in 1930, jumped&#13;
sharply to 23% in Ayutthaya and 11% in Nakon Pathom in 1940, declined by&#13;
1950, and then increased in 1970 to a level 3% less than 1940 in Ayutthaya&#13;
and a level equal to 1940 for Nakon Pathom.&#13;

1.52      Land rental agreements are often a reflection of high demand for&#13;
land during phases of the life cycle in the farm family when the family&#13;
labor force is high relative to the norm. Families at a different cycle,&#13;
find it difficult to fully cultivate their own land and rent out some part&#13;
of their holding. After studying land demand patterns in farm households,&#13;
Stifle concludes:&#13;
"The structure and conduct in the operations of the agricultural&#13;
lauid market suggest tentatively that the landlords are not ex-&#13;
ploiting the farmers by charging rentals over the competitive&#13;
norm. Landlords are too heterogeneous to be able to set prices&#13;
in concert. In most cases, they are relatives of the tenants&#13;
and/or neighbors living together in the same village, with re-&#13;
lationships which are necessarily personalized and unique.&#13;
Variations in the quality of land, even within a single village,&#13;
also discourage collusive rent-fixing by the landlords. Stated&#13;
rental rates are diverse, reflecting the land's relative location&#13;
soil quality and access to irrigation or flood waters. Although&#13;
the elasticity of demand for rentable land cannot be measured,&#13;
the cultivators are vividly aware of alternatives to renting&#13;
village land, such as urban migration or seeking new land, acti-&#13;
vities which they often recommend to their children. The rela-&#13;
tively short duration of rental arrangements reflects the short&#13;
term, cyclical nature of family land requirements; it may evi-&#13;
dence that the land rental market is functioning effectively not,&#13;
as some have expressed, an insecurity in the tenure rights of&#13;
the farmers." 1/&#13;
Both the aggregate data by regions on land worked and owned by the farm community&#13;
and micro data from detailed village studies suggest that there has not been a&#13;
severe land constraint for Thai farmers. Instances of economic hardship leading&#13;
to loss of land certainly occur, but these do not provide the basis for accurate&#13;
generalizations about the rural sector in Thailand.&#13;
1.53      The development of land utilization in Thailand has been greatly&#13;
influenced by the land abundance relative to population and to policies carried&#13;
out during the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. The conscious whittling away&#13;
of feudal obligations of the farmers and the gradual elimination of the system&#13;
of debt slavery in combination with the opening up of world markets for agricultural&#13;
output led to rapid expansion of cultivated area. 2/ By custom, any man could&#13;
claim as much land as could be cultivated by his family, usually around 25 rai&#13;
per household. After three years of cultivation, it became thXe property of the&#13;
farmer. The Consolidated Land Act of 1908 confirmed the right to as much land&#13;
as could be "turned to profit" which in practice amounted to anywhere from 20 to&#13;

50 rai. A specific 50 rai limit was instituted in 1936 for land in the public&#13;
domain that is newly settled. The ready availability of land also provided&#13;
an attractive alternative to wage employment and tenant relationships that&#13;
undermined the developmenit of an estate type agriculture even if the legal&#13;
constraints had not been present.&#13;
1.54      While the rapid expansion of settlements has changed conditions&#13;
in rural Thailand, keeping some historical perspective is a worthwhile guard&#13;
against drawing unwarranted conclusions from incomplete or misunderstood infor-&#13;
mation. It was only five decades ago that careful study of the rural sector&#13;
defined the most important problem as low population densities and the limited&#13;
areas of settlement. 1/ The average size of land holdings of agricultural&#13;
households was 26 rai 2/ in 1971 (22 rai in 1963), somewhat higher than the&#13;
average size of farm holding reported for the mid 19th Century when land was&#13;
free for the taking as long as it could be cultivated. 3/ To the limited extent&#13;
in which the rural sector has experienced debt-land incumbrance problems, the&#13;
problem probably lies more with the heavy export taxation in the post World War&#13;
II period studied in Section II than with rural credit or marketing arrangements.&#13;
Water Control in Rural Thailand&#13;
1.55      The existing state of the irrigation infrastructure in Thailand 4/&#13;
and the potential for its expansion is an important part of the study of&#13;
land resources for several reasons. Firstly, an attempt is made to take into&#13;
account the subsidies to the agricultural sector implicit in low or zero&#13;
cost supplies of irrigation water in section II where the focus is often on&#13;
improved techniques requiring improved water control. It is useful to have&#13;
an estimate of existing and potential irrigation to put this work in perspec-&#13;
tive. Secondly, with more limited scope for agricultural growth through ex-&#13;
pansion of cultivated area, future growth in output will depend to a greater&#13;
extent than in the past on improved seed varieties, chemical inputs, and&#13;
higher cropping intensities. The potential for all of these changes is partly&#13;
dependent on improved water control and cannot be fully understood independently&#13;
of the potential for irrigation. Thirdly, the distributional implication of&#13;
large-scale investments primarily benefitting landowners in irrigated areas&#13;
within an agricultural taxation system based heavily on export taxes born by all&#13;
1/   See Carl C. Zimmerman, Siam, Rural Economic Survey, 1930-31 (Bangkok,1951).&#13;
2/   Area in agricultural holdings in 1971 divided by number of non-municipal&#13;
households outside of sanitary districts. The average farm holdings&#13;
reported in the National Statistical Office Agricultural Census, 1963&#13;
was 22 rai.&#13;
3/   The 25 mai was generally a maximum area for new holdings in the 1850s.&#13;
The reports of observers suggest considerable smaller average holding.&#13;

(potential) producers of surpluses over on-farm consumption needs cannot be&#13;
adequately quantified without estimates of areas with improved water control.&#13;
We begin with an analysis of the existing irrigation system and then deal with&#13;
projected growth in the system over the next decade and a half.&#13;
156      Estimates of areas affected by the irrigation network in 1975 are&#13;
summarized in Table 9. There is considerable doubt about the reliability of&#13;
data on irrigation in Thailand because the Royal Irrigation Department figures&#13;
(given in Table 9 by region) are based on design areas that often overesti-&#13;
mate the actual areas benefitting from projects. 1/ For this reason, data&#13;
by region is also presented based on World Bank estimates. The RID data is&#13;
presented for irrigable areas (areas designed to be served by irrigation&#13;
projects either existing or under construction in 1975) and for irrigated&#13;
areas (irrigable areas minus the project area where construction has still&#13;
not been completed). Estimates by the World Bank irrigation review mission 2/&#13;
are presented for "service areas" (areas where irrigation benefits are poten-&#13;
tially possible) and "irrigated areas" (areas where crop production has&#13;
benefitted to some degree from water control). To put this data into per-&#13;
spective, total cultivated area by region is also shown.&#13;
1.57      The RID and the World Bank estimates of the service or irrigable&#13;
areas in the existing and under construction irrigation system correspond&#13;
fairly closely for the northern, central and southern regions of the country.&#13;
However, in the northeast, the World Bank estimate is one-half of the RID&#13;
estimate. The RID estimate of areas receiving irrigation benefits is 40%&#13;
higher for the country as a whole with substantial differences concentrated&#13;
in the central and the northeast regions. While the implications of the&#13;
alternative RID estimates will occasionally be noted, the feeling that the&#13;
official data is suspect is so pervasive in Thailand that it appears better&#13;
to rely on the World Bank estimates. 3/&#13;
1.58      There are two important conclusions to be drawn from Table 9.&#13;
Firstly, irrigated agriculture is concentrated largely in the central region&#13;
and is relatively insignificant in the Northeast and South. The service area&#13;
of the existing infrastructure covers 44% of the cultivated areas in the cen-&#13;
tral region and some 30% of cultivated area acttually obtains some irrigation&#13;
benefits. The irrigated areas are only 10% in the north and less than 1%&#13;
in both the northeast and south. Secondly, the proportion of cultivated areas&#13;
1/   Extensive rehabilitation would be required for some projects to meet&#13;

3/   Unfortunately, it is not possible to fully reconcile the differences&#13;
between RID and World Bank estimates. It should also be noted that on&#13;
the basis of reports on irrigation in the 1963 Agricultural Census,&#13;
J. Behrman argued that it is quite possible "that the Royal Irrigation&#13;
Department has been underestimating facilities in areas other than the&#13;
Bangkok Plain" (J. Behrman, Supply Response in Undeveloped Agriculture,&#13;

receiving dry season irrigation benefits are very limited; less than 10%&#13;
in the Central Region, 2.5% in the North, with less than 1% in the Northeast&#13;
and South.&#13;
1.59      Since rainfall is almost sufficient for most crops in the wet&#13;
season other than rice (and to a lesser extent sugarcane), the extent of the&#13;
irrigation system is also usefully judged relative to total paddyland. This&#13;
can be done both by use of the World Bank wet season irrigated area estimates&#13;
and the results obtained in the crop cutting surveys carried out by the&#13;
National Statistical Office. 1/ The data in Table 10 shows that a half to&#13;
two-thirds of the paddyland in the central region obtains some irrigation&#13;
benefits. Since some irrigated land is used for crops other than rice&#13;
(mainly sugarcane) in the central plain, the World Bank estimate is probably&#13;
high. Since benefits of the irrigation system via improved flood control may&#13;
not be recognized by farmers not using water from the irrigation canals, the&#13;
NSO estimates are probably low. The range between the estimates is sufficient&#13;
to give some feel for the importance of irrigation facilities in rice production&#13;
in the central region in the wet season. From a quarter to a third of the&#13;
paddyland in the north receives irrigation benefits. The role of irrigation&#13;
is much less important in the Northeast and South, although there is a&#13;
considerable difference between the World Bank and NSO estimates. The large&#13;
divergence for the Northeast estimates in particular cast some doubt on the&#13;
World Bank downward adjustments to the RID data. 2/&#13;
1.60      The potential for improved water control will be set out based on&#13;
projections for 1990. 3/ These projections along with a summary of the existing&#13;
system are shown in Table 11. Several conclusions are suggested by these&#13;
estimates. Firstly, wet season irrigated area is projected to increase by 40%&#13;
and dry season irrigation by 135% between 1976 and 1990, although the area&#13;
obtaining wet season benefits will still be more than double the area with dry&#13;
season effects (compared to about a quarter in 1976). Secondly, although&#13;
irrigated areas in both seasons will grow more rapidly in all other regions, the&#13;
Central Region with a quarter of the water's cultivated area will still account&#13;
for 60% of both wet and dry season irrigated areas -- a reflection mainly of the&#13;
topographical advantages of the central plain.&#13;
1.61      It should be noted that the increases in areas receiving irrigation&#13;
benefits as recorded in Table 11 do not fully capture the projected changes&#13;
in water control. The total area figures obscure an expected improvement&#13;

farm holdings, respectively.&#13;
2/   The RID data list an irrigated area for the northeast that is 4.2 times&#13;
the World Bank estimates. The use of the RID data would lead to esti-&#13;
mates of the percentage of paddyland with irrigation that would corres-&#13;
pond closely to the NSO survey results.&#13;

l/ This Tk--be is based on, World Bank Anne- L: Irrigation PrograM Review, Tables&#13;
1 and 4,Decenber 1976. There are inconsistencies or inadequately explainid&#13;
entrias in these tables. The existing irrigated areas not scheduled for&#13;
impro-:ment in 19cO for the North Chao Phya and South exceeds the present&#13;
irrigatved area by L37,000 rai. Since this is less than 3% of the total&#13;
irrigated area in 1990 and since the service area of projects in these areas&#13;
at the present time exceed the irrigated area, no adjuxstment has been made&#13;
(since the excess may represent increased irrigated area not requiring invest-&#13;
maent for in-rovements). An arith'metic error leads to the 1990 wet season&#13;
irrigated area being overestimated by 3.6%; the adjustment is made in this&#13;
Table. In the dry season present irrigated area, 31 thousand rai included&#13;
in the Northeast region in Annex L; Table 1 are eliminated in Annex 4. Table 4t,&#13;
but 31 thousand rai more are added to tributaries of the Mekongzl in the North.&#13;
Lhe figlures used here are consistert with Table 4 and not Table 1 in Annex L;&#13;
of World Bank report.&#13;
2/ The large dry season areas in the South Chao Phya Plain at the present tUne&#13;
are irrigated by pumps from canals in the Chao Phya Irrigation System. On&#13;
about 875 thousand of the one and a quarter nillion rai used in this way in&#13;
1976, the dry season rice crop was the only crop, simply replacing the tradi-&#13;
tional wet season crop.&#13;
3/ The expanded area in the Mae Klong area includes 312 thousand ral expected&#13;
to be used for sugarcane whereas this is not included in the World Bank&#13;

areas under irrigation.&#13;

in water control. The total area figures obscure an expected improvement&#13;
on 4,438 thousand rai presently benefitting from the irrigation infrastruc-&#13;
ture. Most of this is in the central plain and to a lesser extent in the&#13;
north, 1/ so that any impression from Table 11 that investment in irrigation&#13;
will be equally distributed to the northeast and south, where the expansion&#13;
of irrigated area in the wet season is not too different from the changes in&#13;
the North and Central Regions, is not justified.&#13;
1.62      Some perspective on the intermediate run importance of irrigated&#13;
agriculture can be obtained by comparing irrigated areas in the present and&#13;
in 1990 to total cultivated area and paddyland in recent years. This is done&#13;
in Table 12. The wet season irrigated area, even if the projections for 1990&#13;
are reached, will be less than 15% of the present cultivated area (about 14%&#13;
for the North; 3% for the Northeast; 37% for the Central Region; and 10% for&#13;
the South). The projected wet season irrigated area is 34% of paddy area&#13;
(24% in 1975) with 34% in the North; (26% in 1975); 7.5% in the Northeast;&#13;
(1.5% in 1975); 81% in the Central Region (65% in 1975) and 39% in the South&#13;
(19% in 1975)5 The dry season irrigated area in 1990, despite more than&#13;
doubling since 1975, will be less than 7% of cultivated area of recent years&#13;
and less than 16% of wet season paddy area in 1973); (16% in the North; 4% in&#13;
the Northeast; 37% in the Central Region; and 6% in the South).&#13;
1/   Existing irrigated areas where improvement is expected between 1976 and&#13;
1990 include 1,187 thousand rai in the North, 2,375 thousand rai in the&#13;
Chao Phya Plain, and 312 thousand rai in the Bang Pakong basin in the&#13;

II. AGRICULTURAL POLICIES AND THE RURAL SECTOR&#13;
2.01      While agricultural growth has been based on the effects of decisions&#13;
by millions of farm families in response to changing market conditions and&#13;
opportunities, there has been a very substantial impact from Government&#13;
policies. We review the policies affecting both product and factor markets&#13;
in the agricultural sector in Section A. The allocational effects of these&#13;
policies are discussed in Section B.&#13;
A.   Government Intervention in Product and Factor Markets&#13;
2.02      The most important form of Government intervention in the rural&#13;
economy has been through restricting access to world markets for the major&#13;
agricultural products, mainly via export taxation of rice and rubber. The&#13;
sugar sector has also been affected by policy intervention that resulted in&#13;
protection to the sector except for a brief period of heavy taxation durintg&#13;
the mid-1970s. 1/ These interferences completely dominate the effects of all&#13;
other product market interferences. They will be studied in detail while a&#13;
brief summary will be given for other crops.&#13;
2.03      On the input side, a period of significantly inflated prices for&#13;
nitrogen based fertilizer inputs occurred between 1968 and 1973 when domestic&#13;
fertilizer production was heavily protected. At the present time, however,&#13;
interferences in both fertilizers and other chemical inputs are minor. A&#13;
more important subsidy to inputs results from the zero-cost supply of water&#13;
in areas where irrigation projects have been implemented. Our analysis of&#13;
the input markets will center on these two policies. The water pricing&#13;
question will be of growing importance over the coming decades in line with&#13;
the expansion of the irrigation infrastructure as reviewed in Section II.&#13;
Rice Policies 2/&#13;
2.04      The greatest expansion in rice production in Thailand took place&#13;
after the signing of the Bowing Treaty in 1956 which removed a ban on rice&#13;
exports. 3/ Although the treaty limited export taxes to a very low level, it&#13;
provided an escape clause allowing export controls when domestic shortages&#13;
threatened. The policy debate on the use of this escape clause reflected the&#13;
different interests of the producing and consuming groups in Thailand, a&#13;
conflict that was to resurface in the post World War II period. In contrast,&#13;
1/   To put these three crops in perspective to each other, the farm value&#13;
of rice, sugarcane, and rubber accounted for 46%, 7% and 3% of the&#13;
total farm value of all crops (equal to 65.3 billion baht) in 1975.&#13;
2/   An excellent survey of post War rice policies prior to 1973 is available&#13;
in Ammar Siamwalla, A History of Rice Policies in Thailand, Food Research&#13;
Institute Studies, 1975.&#13;
3/   The ban was not totally effective but pre Bowing Treaty exports were&#13;
small. See J. Ingram, Economic Change in Thailand, 1850-1970, Stanford,&#13;
1971, Chapter 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40-&#13;
however, to the later period, the rural interests generally prevailed.&#13;
Limited use of quantitative restrictions, a low export tax on rice, and a&#13;
system of land taxation providing incentives for clearing land resulted in&#13;
the production of an export surplus almost equal to total national consumption&#13;
requirements representing almost a third of world exports.&#13;
2.05      The post war system of heavy taxation of the rice sector was&#13;
introduced in response to war reparations requiring deliveries of rice to the&#13;
Allies at below market nrices. Although these reparations were renegotiated&#13;
downwards and eliminated in 1948, the monopoly on all external trade that had&#13;
been instituted to generate the required rice was technically maintained&#13;
until the mid-1950s. In practice, all but sales to foreign Governments were&#13;
initiated by private exporting firms on the basis of export licenses obtained&#13;
from the Ministry of Commerce. Export proceeds had to be surrendered at an&#13;
overvalued unified official rate before 1947 and at punitive rates under a&#13;
multiple exchange rate system from 1947 to 1955. However, even with the low&#13;
foreign exchange rate applied to earnings, export licenses were very profitable&#13;
and corruption in the allocation process was evident In 1950, a rice premium&#13;
was introduced to capture some of these profits for Government revenue over&#13;
and above that obtained through exchange market transactions. The 'premium'&#13;
was a specific fee to be paid for export licenses at rates dependent on the&#13;
grade of rice. Although it is an export tax in all its effects, the legal&#13;
distinction allows the 'premium' to be varied without legislation.&#13;
2.06      While attention will be focused on the last two decades, it is&#13;
useful to have some perspective on the degree of export taxation implied in&#13;
these policies. The total revenue obtained from the foreign exchange operations&#13;
in rice, the rice premium, profits of the Rice Office on Government to&#13;
Government sales and an 'export tax' introduced in 1952 accounted for more&#13;
than a quarter of total Government revenue and somewhere around a quarter to&#13;
a third of the value of exports during the 1949-53 period.&#13;
2.07      The domestic (wholesale) and world (FOB Bangkok) prices for 5%&#13;
rice are plotted for the 1956 to 1977 period in Chart I. The rice premium,&#13;
the export tax, and .he tax implied by a rice reserve policy to be explained&#13;
below are plotted for the same period in Chart II. The period from 1955 to&#13;
1966 was characterized by remarkable stability in world rice markets.&#13;
Monthly FOB prices for 5% rice, for instance, did not vary outside the range&#13;
between 2,400 and 3,500 bhat per ton. 1/ In fact, the FOB price was within&#13;
the 2,600 to 3,200 baht per ton price range for all but 19 of the 132 months&#13;
preceding 1966. While the rice premium was not changed extensively, even&#13;
greater stability was observed in the domestic rice markets, mainly the&#13;
result of quantitative controls being introduced (as in parts of 1957, 1958&#13;
and 1959 and again in 1962 and 1965) whenever upward movements in rice prices&#13;
were pronounced. The domestic wholesale price of 5% rice was rarely outside&#13;
the 1,400 to 1,900 baht per ton range. 2/ -'7t has been argued that the&#13;
premium was not an effective mechanism for stabilizing the domestic rice&#13;

prices during this period. 1/   However, the export control mechanism was not&#13;
really tested and the little stabilization effort that was attempted was&#13;
carried out primarily through the use of the quantitative restrictions.&#13;
2.08      Of greater relevance than the stability in the price series is&#13;
the massive extent of the interference with rice prices. On the average,&#13;
wholesale prices of 5% rice were 56% of FOB prices.2/ With very little&#13;
variation evident in this ratio. Since markups over wholesale price are very&#13;
low, 3/ this reflects a substantial export tax of almost 40% of the FOB&#13;
price. The rice premium (shown for the 1955 to 1976 period in Table 13 for&#13;
three grades of rice that are important in domestic consumption patterns) 4/&#13;
in combination with the export tax that varied between 3.8 and 5.2% accounts&#13;
for virtually all the differences between wholesale and FOB prices. This is&#13;

plotted in Chart II in relationship to the price differential for 5% rice.&#13;
2.09      The level of taxation resulting from a premium around 40% of the&#13;
FOB price is usefully considered in relationship to the farmgate price of&#13;
rice. Using detailed data on marketing margins, Usher estimated that even&#13;
if world prices were forced up by a small amount (3%) by the Thai trade&#13;
restrictions, a tax at the rate of 43% of the FOB price was equivalent to&#13;
a tax of 85.6% on the farmgate price if all marketing margins remained&#13;
constant 5/; an estimate based on a farmgate - wholesale price margin of 14%.&#13;
A study by Sura Sanittanont indicates a somewhat higher mark-up up with&#13;
the farmgate price 80% of the wholesale price. 6/ With no effect on the&#13;
world price and constant marketing margins, a 40% tax on the FOB price would&#13;
then translate into an 83% tax on the farmgate price. These and related&#13;

4/   Exports weights, implicit in using the ratio of tax revenue to total&#13;
export, are not appropriate for analyzing the impact of the export taxes&#13;
on the domestic price system for rice and, therefore, the allocation and&#13;
distributional impact resulting from these price effects. A weighting&#13;
scheme of .65 to 5% rics, .25 to Al Super rice, and .10 to C3 rice seems&#13;
reasonable for many purposes in light of output proportions reported for&#13;
typical rice mills. See, for instance, Yuavares Gaesuwan, Ammar Siam-&#13;

estimates show some variance. 1/ However, taxes in the range of 40-45% of&#13;
the export price and 80-85% of the farmgate prices appear to give an accurate&#13;
picture of the 1955-66 period if the twin assLuMptions of no significant&#13;
impact on the world price and constant trade markups are adhered to. We&#13;
shall argue below that these assumptions are approximateiy correct.&#13;
2.10      The term 'crisis' might appear inappropriate for a period with rising&#13;
prices of a major export commodity. Nevertheless, this characterization has&#13;
been applied to the 1966-69 period 2/ and, this is an apt description given the&#13;
disproportionate weight political power of the 15% of Thailand's population in&#13;
municipal areas. Rising domestic prices undermine political support among&#13;
Government bureaucrats who have still not recovered pre-World War II real salary&#13;
levels and among urban interests benefitting both from cheap rice prices and&#13;
from an artificially lowered suppl-y price of labor from the rural sector -- a&#13;
consequence of the on-farm opportunity cost being substantially lowered by the&#13;
heavy taxation of rice production. The Government reacted to the increased&#13;
world price of rice by substantially tightening export controls. Quantitative&#13;
restrictions were imposed and much of the excess profits otherwise accruing to&#13;
those obtaining export licenses were captured by increases in the rice premium.&#13;
Premium rates were more than doubled for most grades. The policy response was&#13;
sufficiently strong that the tax in percentage terms increased and the upward&#13;
pressure on domestic rice prices was dampened. The domestic price of 5% rice 3/&#13;
for instance, increased to around 65% of world prices in late 1966 due to a&#13;
lag in adjustment of the taxes but then down to around 43% of world prices in&#13;
1968 when world prices had started to decline and the premiums again adjusted&#13;
with a lag. Despite the higher taxation in this period, farm gate prices rose&#13;
in line with domestic wholesale prices. Detailed Government studies of the&#13;
structure of rice prices in 1969 indicated farmgate to wholesale price ratio&#13;
(79%) in line with the studies for the earlier period of price stability. 4/&#13;
This reflects the competitive and efficient nature of the rice marketing&#13;
system in Thailand.&#13;
2.11      A minor element in the increased taxation of rice exports during&#13;
this mini crisis was the reintroduction of a 'reserve ratio' requirement&#13;
1/   References to other studies on the structure of marketing margins is&#13;
reviewed in Agriculture Marketing Section, Dept. of Agricultural&#13;
Economics, "Agriculture Marketing Survey, Stage I: A Review of&#13;
Literature and Information," June 1976.&#13;
2/   See Ammar Siamwalla, "A History of Rice Politics in Thailand," Food&#13;

3/   This statement and all other dealing with domestic rice prices in this&#13;
section are based on data from the Internal Trade Department, Ministry&#13;
of Commerce.&#13;
4/   While use of the Usher estimate of 86% [The Economics of the Rice Pre-&#13;
mium (mimeo, undated)] would imply a fall, a 14% marketing margin inclu-&#13;
sive of milling costs appears low. The 20% margin, low by world stan-&#13;
dards, is shown in the Sura Sanittanont's study, Thailand's Rice Export&#13;
Tax: Its Effects on the Rice Economy, Bangkok, 1967.&#13;

on exports. For every ton of rice exported, a certain amount had to be&#13;
supplied to the Government at a price below the prevailing domestic prices&#13;
This policy was actually started in 1962 in order to provide supplies of&#13;
cheap rice to special groups, mostly civil servants. During the period of&#13;
rising prices in 1966, this policy was extended to supply cheap rice for sale&#13;
in limited quantities in urban shops. This changed the nature of the inter-&#13;
vention from an in-kind tax levied on exporters to pay part of Government&#13;
salaries into the first instance of an explicit subsidy program aimed at&#13;
particular low income groups in urban areas. 1/ The estimates of the tax&#13;
rate implied by the rice reserve ratio (reported in Table 14) were obtained&#13;
by multiplying the required amount of rice sold to the Government per ton&#13;
exported by the difference between the domestic wholesale price and the&#13;
Government reserve price. The resulting tax is also plotted in Chart II; the&#13;
tax was an insignificant part of total rice taxation in the 8 months it was&#13;
used in 1962 and the 26 months it was in force in 1966-68 but was to become&#13;
important at a later date.&#13;
2.12      Despite the increased taxation of exports in 1966-69, tax increases&#13;
were dropped to allow farmgate prices to increase and this contributed to&#13;
higher income levels derived in the rural sector. The objective of improving&#13;
farm incomes was also reflected, as rice price receded after 1969, in the&#13;
reduction in export taxes (weighted by exports) to rates considerably below&#13;
the pre-1966 pattern if grades are weighted by exports. In fact, the premium&#13;
was removed on all grades other than 5% and 100% rice. The reduction is also&#13;
observed (see Table 13), but less pronounced, if domestic consumption weights&#13;
are used.&#13;
2.13      The slack rice market did not last for long and upward pressure&#13;
on rice prices in 1972 was the beginning of the second post war 'crisis'&#13;
period. There was almost a five fold increase in the monthly FOB price of 5%&#13;
rice between March 1972 and April 1974. The impact on urban areas is better&#13;
reflected in the triping of the wholesale price of 5% rice from %1,494/ton in&#13;
February 1972 to %4,440/ton in March 1974. The existence of the low price&#13;
rice distribution program extended to the general public in 1966 added to the&#13;
crisis atmosphere by generating long queues for rice. Within the context of&#13;
the highly efficient Thai marketing system, Ammar Siamwalla comments:&#13;
"For most Thai consumers, standing in line for any&#13;
commodity is an indignity, doing so for rice is an&#13;
affront to their sense of decency. The Government&#13;
was pushed into action." 2/ "After seeking other&#13;
plausible villains -- statisticians, smugglers, and&#13;
1/   There has been a large implicit subsidy for all urban households in the&#13;
price depressing effect of the export restrictions.&#13;

even American soldiers -- the Government predictably&#13;
settled on middlemen hoarders as the culprits." 1/&#13;
This exacerbated the problem as rice was withheld from marketing channels for&#13;
fear of confiscation and price controls. The more traditional methods,&#13;
however, began to exert their effects by temporarily separating the domestic&#13;
market from world markets (a total ban on rice exports was imposed for a short&#13;
period in 1973) and thereafter through rapid increases in the tax on exports&#13;
via all three of the basic mechanisms -- the premium, the export tax, and the&#13;
reserve ratio requirement -- now quantitatively significant for the first&#13;
time. 2/ The wholesale price of 5% rice stabilized around 3,800 baht per ton&#13;
as shown in Chart 1.&#13;
2.14      The mismanagement of rice policies was one of many contributing&#13;
factors in setting an environment conducive to the change in Government in&#13;
October 1973. The new Government began a shift of policy in favor of the&#13;
rural sector. This was first apparent in limited policy interference with&#13;
increasing exports and prices at some points in the 1972-74 period with farm&#13;
gate prices already close to triple the lows of 1971 and almost double the&#13;
high of the 1967/68 'crisis' period. Since subsidized rice sales were con-&#13;
tinued throughout the period, this occasionally led to runs on the supply of&#13;
low price rice. In early 1974, subsidized rice prices were increased to prevent&#13;
too great a gap between the rice sold in special shops at the below market price&#13;
(with limits on the amount of transactions) and the free market sales. While an&#13;
effort was made to explain that these changes were required for the benefit of&#13;
farmers, intense opposition developed by labor unions and urban low income&#13;
groups. In more recent years, there has been a decline in farmgate prices in&#13;
line with decreases in price in international markets.&#13;
2.15      A bold but unsound step was made early in the process of weakcii&#13;
ing prices by establishing a floor price of g 2,500 per ton. The concept of&#13;
supporting rice prices in Thailand would be a major shift in policy direction.&#13;
Based on the post war experience, however, the Lechanics of a workable policy&#13;
are clear. A subsidy on exports would lead to a system of supporting farm&#13;
prices with Government revenue financing a part proportionate to the share&#13;
of exports in total off-farm rice sales with rice deficit households financ-&#13;
ing the rest. This would mean that the Government share would be somewhat&#13;
over one third and domestic consumers uould bear the major burden. 3/ This&#13;
result is the mirror image of the export tax system whereby the Government&#13;
collects somewhere around one-third of the tax burden imposed on farmers&#13;

2/   See Chart 2.&#13;
3/   These shares correspond to the ratio of exports to off-farm sales&#13;
derived for 1970 in preliminary work reported in the first draft of a&#13;
note by Amm&amp;r Siamwalla titled "Structure of the Rice System". The&#13;
burden would shift more to the Government as exports respond and per-&#13;
haps some decline in rice consumptions occurs (perhaps because Thais&#13;
eat rice at every meal with little substitution).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-&#13;
and two-thirds is hidden in the subsidy to consumers implicit in depressed&#13;
rice prices. While such a policy is technically feasible, it is doubtful if&#13;
it is economically sound and it certainly is not politically feasible.&#13;
Instead, the Government has been locked into a small and ineffective policy&#13;
of price supports and low income consumption subsidies in combination with&#13;
a significant tax burden still imposed on rice farmers from export taxation.&#13;
If a program to support farm prices while subsidizing consumers were attempt-&#13;
ing seriously via these methods, Government resources would have to cover&#13;
the price differential multiplied by total output of rice. 1/ Given the&#13;
proportions of total output going to exports, the Government resources re-&#13;
quired to support the price via a program that does not imply a burden on&#13;
consumers would be about 14 times the resources required in an export subsidy&#13;
program. Thus, if the $ 2,500 per ton floor price had been maintained in&#13;
1976/77 when farmgate prices had fallen to B 2,100, supporting nationwide&#13;
paddy prices by 0 400 per ton 2/ would have required over 6 billion baht 3/&#13;
-- or about 12% of Government expenditurers.&#13;
2.16      With price support programs not large enough to include all output,&#13;
domestic paddy prices will remain linked to world prices via the level of&#13;
trade taxes. This is an important point because the recent attempts at&#13;
supporting prices by limited Government purchases in the domestic market have&#13;
been discussed as if they represented an increase to aggregate demand that&#13;
will raise prices throughout the nation, admittedly to only a limited degree&#13;
reflecting the size of the program. However, with domestic prices linked via&#13;
unchanged trade taxes to exogenously given world prices there is no secondary&#13;
effects rippling through the market. The private market channels cannot pay&#13;
the Government prices without absorbing the same losses the Government faces.&#13;
While the Government is willing to absorb this burden, the private sector&#13;
will not. The impact of the support price program is, therefore, to give a&#13;
subsidy to the particular rice farmers lucky enough to be involved in the&#13;
program if above market prices are paid and/or to simply cut into the private&#13;
sector share of marketing channels if market prices are paid.&#13;
2.17      If above market prices are paid, the price differential actually&#13;
overestimates the subsidy to the farmers involved in the farm price support&#13;
program just discussed as it ignores the extra time or other costs involved&#13;
in taking advantage of the program. A similar outcome is evident in the&#13;
consumption subsidy program in urban areas. The objective is to improve the&#13;
welfare of low income groups. However, the benefits are dissipated by the&#13;
inconveniences of dealing in limited size transactions or in queuing. In the&#13;
short run, those who use these shops are better off or they wouldn't bother&#13;
with the option, but they are not much better off or a lot more would try to&#13;
take advantage of the subsidy and the system would collapse. In the longer&#13;
1/   There would be no rice retained for consumption on farms if it could&#13;
be sold to the Government at above market prices.&#13;
2/   While the floor was set lower in regions other than the Central Plain,&#13;
so correspondingly are the market prices.&#13;
3/   Obtained by multiplying total paddy output by the differential between&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50-&#13;
run, it is not clear that these groups are benefitted even to the limited&#13;
extent. The long run welfare of low income city dwellers is largely deter-&#13;
mined by the supply price of labor from rural Thailand. Wage rates for low&#13;
income groups reflect the supply price. If any program attempts to signifi-&#13;
cantly improve the welfare of the poor in the city, it will attract migrants&#13;
from the rural areas with corresponding downward pressure on wage rates. The&#13;
result in the long run is a subsidy to employers of labor (usually high&#13;
income groups) hidden in a program aimed at helping the poor.&#13;
2.18      This discussion of these attempts at price support programs should&#13;
not obscure the importance of continuing taxation of rice through traditional&#13;
methods. In fact, the nature of the price support programs in the context&#13;
of continuing export taxation is one of the paradoxes of recent Government&#13;
rice policies. With declining prices in the world rice markets, an attempt&#13;
was made to reduce taxation significantly in 1975. The rice premium was&#13;
cut back to levels not very different from the low point in 1971 with high&#13;
taxes limited to the top grades. With similar taxes but much higher rice&#13;
prices, this implies reduced real taxation. The price of 5% rice wholesale&#13;
has been near 75% of the FOB price -- implying around a 20% export tax on the&#13;
FOB price of 5% rice as opposed to around 33% in 1971. 1/ The level of&#13;
taxation on rice farmers producing paddy for off-farm sales, however, is still&#13;
significant. With a weighted premium of g 515 per ton reported in Table 13,&#13;
an average export tax of g 220 per ton obtained by applying the 5% rate to&#13;
export prices weighted in the same way, and the very recent reintroduction of&#13;
the rice reserve requirement with low price differentials, this still implies&#13;
about a 22% 2/ farmgate tax on rice. While this is very low by post war&#13;
standards (where as we saw, a rate around 80% was imposed throughout much of&#13;
the 1955-66 period with even higher rates in 1966-68 and 1972-75) it still&#13;
leaves rice along with rubber as the two most significantly taxed sectors in&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
2.-9      Throughout the post war period, the Government has also intervened&#13;
in rice markets though Government-to-Government sales. This is often for&#13;
exports to countries where all rice imports are a Government monopoly (for&#13;
instance, Sri Lanka, India, and Japan) and usually involves lower grades&#13;
of rice. The share of these Government-to-Government exports have been&#13;
substantial ranging from 27 to 45% of the total quantity of exports (Table&#13;
13). However, once contracts are established they are in effect turned over&#13;
to private export firms to be fulfilled. The rice exports under Government-&#13;
to-Government sales are subject to the reserv-- rtio requirements.    Nonetheless,&#13;
total export taxes may differ for Government- ;overnment sales as the&#13;
profits from the transaction are transferred to Government revenue in lieu of&#13;
the rice premium. There is some evidence that the export price in Government-&#13;
to-Government sales have been lower than in private sales and that prices are&#13;
1/   Based on comparison of differentials between wholesale and FOB prices&#13;
of 5% rise after allowing for 5% marketing margins.&#13;
2/   This is determined by calculating the combined tax on a ton of rice&#13;
(about $ 750) on a ton of paddy using a 66% conversion rate resulting&#13;
in a tax of about 1 452. With the farmgate prices now around $ 2,100,&#13;
this implies a 22% tax rate.&#13;

more stable than in the private market, 1/ but the effects of direct Govern-&#13;
ment dealings in rice market do not appear to have the quantitative importance&#13;
of any of the other policies.&#13;
2.20      These are two assumptions implicit in the above description of rice&#13;
markets -- the high degree of efficiency and competition in the marketing&#13;
channels and the severely limited potential for passing the export taxes on&#13;
to foreign consumers. The high degree of competition from the farm gate&#13;
through milling to the wholesale level shouldn't be controversial. Small&#13;
villages often have almost a dozen options on where to have their rice&#13;
milled. Trucks spread out from different mills in the harvest season trying&#13;
to increase their volume in a low mark-up business. Thai farmer's shares of&#13;
wholesale prices for rice are high by world standards. If there are any&#13;
doubts about the margins it is at the exporter's stage where the number of&#13;
firms with access to licenses is limited. Three points should be noted.&#13;
Firstly, the evidence, referred to in discussing the wholesale price differ-&#13;
entials, indicates low markups. Secondly, if some monopoly power exists, the&#13;
policy implications for the rice premium are not obvious since export taxes&#13;
are just another cost element which a monopsonist will partially shift back&#13;
to his suppliers under realistic assumptions on supply conditions. 2/&#13;
Thirdly, if monopsony power exists, the correct policy implications are to be&#13;
found in removing (mainly Government) barriers to entry into export activities.&#13;
In any case, it is not clear that lack of competitiveness in the traditional&#13;
sense was really a contention in the debates in the 1950s and 1960s when&#13;
opponents of rice policies were claiming that the premium was passed back&#13;
to the farm gate prices, while Government officials claimed it was soaking up&#13;
excess profits of exporters. In terms of the impact of the rice taxation on&#13;
farm gate prices, the opponents of the premium were correct if it is inter-&#13;
preted as the whole system of rice market interferences including the frequent&#13;
use of export quotas. However, Government officials were correct in light of&#13;
the original reasons the premium was introduced; i.e. to tax away the windfall&#13;
gains to firms with export quotas when quantitative restrictions were in effect.&#13;
2.21      The assumption of lack of monopoly power in world markets can not rest&#13;
solely on the negligible shares of Thailand in world rice production because&#13;
free trade does not characterize either the import or export policies of many&#13;
countries and variations in Thai imports do not simply shrink into insignificance&#13;
in a huge integrated market. In fact, some effect on world prices might have&#13;
resulted from Thailand's substantial share (over 20%) of world markets in the&#13;
1950s and 1960s, but it is a less convincing argument given that Thailand's&#13;
world market share has dwindled to about half these levels in the 1970s. Based&#13;
on observations of the process during the 1970s, it seems that some mild impact&#13;
on world prices is likely during unstable market periods when prices are rising&#13;

on world prices is likely during unstable market periods when prices are rising&#13;
rapidly. However, for periods when rice markets have been more stable, there is&#13;
little evidence that Thai policies can have any impact on equilibrium prices.&#13;
Even in a world including the tight market periods, Olarn Chaipravat and Sayan&#13;
Pariwat estimated that the removal of all taxes on 5% rice in 1976 (of about&#13;
$ 800 to i 1,000) would have had a minimal 9 40 per ton impact on world prices&#13;
reduction from $ 4,600 to I 4,560 per ton). 1/   This result is accepted as the&#13;
working hypothesis in this study. Government policies affecting other agricultural&#13;
product and factor markets will be discussed prior to returning to rice policies&#13;
in the following section on resource allocation effects.&#13;
Sugarcane /and the Role of Government Interventions&#13;
2.22      The sugarcane industry has a long history in Thailand.   In the&#13;
1850s, the potential for sugar so impressed Bowing that he predicted that it&#13;
would emerge as the leading export with the opening up of foreign markets.&#13;
Substantial growth did occur in the first three decades after the Bowing&#13;
Treaty (1855). However, due to local taxation, protection of beet sugar in&#13;
Europe, competition from the Philippines, reduced imports in Japan, more&#13;
favorable prospects for rice and severe flood damage along the Ta Chin River&#13;
(the most important of the sugarcane areas), the industry declined rapidly in&#13;
the late 19th century. A limited revival occurred in the half decade before&#13;
the Great Depression -- after Thailand regained control over the structure of&#13;
trade taxes that had been restricted by treaty and used it to increase&#13;
tariffs on sugar imports. 3/ With the disruptions to trade in World War II&#13;
and wartime damage to sugar factories in neighboring countries, a further&#13;
stimulus was given to the industry. These developments led to an expansion&#13;
in sugarcane area planted from 56 thousand rai in early 1930s to 240 thousand&#13;
rai in 1947 (compared to around 30 million rai in rice).&#13;
2.23      The Government role in sugarcane has been important ever since&#13;
the revival in the late 1920s and 1930s. This took the form of direct&#13;
investment in processing facilities (the first modern sugar processing&#13;
factories were Government plants started in Lampang in 1937 and Uttaradit in&#13;
1941) and through heavy protection via import restrictions and taxes. Domestic&#13;
retail prices for sugar were about 60-70% higher than the c.i.f. price. The&#13;
Government was also heavily involved in the sugar sector during the 1940s,&#13;
setting up Muscavado plants in the face of wartime shortages, and through a&#13;
largely ineffective attempt at price controls. Despite high cost production&#13;

in Thailand due to low yields and low sugar content in the local cane,&#13;
privately owned factories grew rapidly in the immediate post war period. The&#13;
area planted increased by almost two-and-a-half times from 1947 to 1953.1/&#13;
2.24      Aside from the high cost borne by consumers, the first real diffi-&#13;
culties with the protectionist policies developed in 1952-53 when the world&#13;
price decreased significantly and low cost sugar from Taiwan entered the&#13;
Thai market. The reduced domestic prices caused losses in sugar processing&#13;
which forced some plants to close. The price of cane fell from g 104 per ton&#13;
in 1951 to # 81 per ton in 1953. Many farters in Cholburi, one of the main&#13;
production areas in the country, switched over from sugarcane to cassava.&#13;
2.25      This period was a watershed in Government policy toward the sugar&#13;
sector. There were basically two options: withdrawal from active inter-&#13;
ference in the sector or the provision of increased protection through still&#13;
higher import restrictions. Not only was the latter course of action adopted,&#13;
but it was done in a way which even more completely linked the Government to&#13;
the sugar industry. A Government enterprise was set up (the Thailand Sugar&#13;
Corporation - TSC) in March 1953. The stated objectives were to encourage&#13;
continued production of sugar by maintaining the domestic price above produc-&#13;
tion costs through its monopoly control on sugar imports; to raise the produc-&#13;
tion efficiency of sugarcane farmers and sugar mills by providing improved&#13;
sugarcane varieties, low-priced fertilizers, short-term credit to cane&#13;
farmers, and loans for the modernization of existing mills; and finally, by&#13;
building a modern sugar mill.&#13;
2.26      While the objective was to set up an organization that would encour-&#13;
age viable domestic production without high levels of protection, the effect&#13;
of the TSC monopoly was to add substantially to the protection given to the&#13;
local industry by creating a sizeable markup on the domestic price of sugar&#13;
over the CIF plus tariff price and by using direct purchases to support the&#13;
wholesale price of domestic sugar. The important price relationships for&#13;
sugarcane resulting from this intervention are set out in Chart III. Thai&#13;
sugar was sold at a wholesale price around 20% below the higher quality im-&#13;
ported sugar. Even so the wholesale price on domestic sugar was above the&#13;
CIF plus tariff price of imported sugar. The average markup on the CIF&#13;
and tariff cost of imported sugar in TSC sales was 39% in 1953, 23% in&#13;
1954, 9% in 1955, and 11% in 1956. 2/ This added protection was sufficient&#13;
to maintain the variability of domestic industry but growth was slow during&#13;
these years.&#13;
2.27      Due to inefficiencies reflected in an inability to market the total&#13;
domestic supply effectively, losses of domestic sugar in storage, and an&#13;
inability to obtain Government funds which TSC was supposed to use to advance&#13;
payments to the mills, the TSC monopoly on the domestic trade and its support&#13;
of the domestic wholesale price collapsed and the internal trade was freed.&#13;

The TSC monopoly on imports was maintained, dependent on authorizations from&#13;
the Ministry of Commerce.&#13;
2.28      The increased protection from the almost 100% tariff rate led&#13;
to an increase in production with eventual downward pressure on prices,&#13;
demands for more Government assistance, a complete ban on imports, and to a&#13;
new phase in Thailand's sugar industry with a switch from a highly protected&#13;
import competing industry to a highly subsidized export industry. This&#13;
implied a shift from a program which generated Government revenue via import&#13;
tariffs to one which required revenue draining export subsidies if further&#13;
growth was to occur. One part of the difficulty involved in private indus-&#13;
tries riding the protection often required to a greater extent by the less&#13;
efficient Government enterprises was easy to solve theoretically. The&#13;
Ministry of Industry clamped a ban on the establishment of any new sugar&#13;
mills or the expansion of existing ones. However, the enforcement of these&#13;
regulations varied and these restrictions did not prevent an increase in&#13;
output, a resulting fall in domestic prices, and some weeding out among the&#13;
industry with several less efficient mills closing down. A further solution&#13;
was sought in the formation of a cartel that would discriminate between the&#13;
domestic market and the export market. The Cartel Plan ran into immediate&#13;
difficulties. First,, some of the larger more efficient firms refused to&#13;
cooperate in a scheme that would limit their expansion relative to less&#13;
efficient firms. Secondly, the world price of raw sugar was around 1.43-1.54&#13;
baht per kg -- a level estimated by Phitsanes to be about one-half of the&#13;
production cost on average in the Thai industry. It is difficult enough to&#13;
decide how to divide up a lucrative domestic market. The prospect of dividing&#13;
up below cost sales in world markets seemed an even more imposing task and&#13;
the scheme fell through.  The Go="?rnment responided to these difficulties with&#13;
a plan aimed at continued viability or even expansion of the sector without&#13;
providing a drain on Government resources. An export subsidy for raw sugar&#13;
was to be financed by a cess (or tax) on the production of centrifugal sugar&#13;
(i.e., raw sugar, brown sugar, and plantation white sugar) at a rate fixed by&#13;
the Ministry of Industry.&#13;
2.29      The economics of the cess-subsidy system are explained in a partial&#13;
equilibrium framework with reference to Figure 1, 1/' where the domestic&#13;
demand curve for sugar is plotted as DD, the domestic supply curve is SS, and&#13;
the exogenously given world price is defined by the FOB price line.   With&#13;
free trade, s units of sugar would be consumed, p units would be produced,&#13;
and s-p units would be imported. Three alternative market interventions&#13;
aimed at protecting the domestic producers are considered. An import ban&#13;
would lead to production and consumption of r units with a domestic price u&#13;
-- with a net loss to the economy equal to hjm. 2/ This more or less was&#13;
1/ For simplicity, the distinction between refined sugar for the domestic&#13;
market and raw sugar for the export market is ignored in this diagram.&#13;
2/ These costs are obtained by calculating the net effects on consumers,&#13;
producers and on Government revenue. In this particular case, there is&#13;
no Government Revenue effect, the loss to consumers due to higher prices&#13;
with the import ban is measured by uimh while the gain to producers is&#13;
uijh leading to the net loss hjm, usefully thought of as a net consump-&#13;
tion loss hvm and a net production jhiv.&#13;

where Thailand was prior to the passage of the Sugar Industry Act of 1962.&#13;
An export subsidy designed to increase production from r units to (say) t&#13;
units would require a per unit subsidy of d-i baht, would lead to a domestic&#13;
price of d baht, and would stimulate t-w units of exports -- with a net loss&#13;
to the economy of jgn plus flm. 1/ The production cess - export subsidy&#13;
policy that was adopted is best: considered in the context of a system that&#13;
would provide the same protective effect to the industry as the straight&#13;
export subsidy program. The production tax of c-d baht will shift the supply&#13;
curve from SS to S'S'. With this new supply curve, an export subsidy of c-rn&#13;
baht will be required to lead to a solution with t units of domestic production&#13;
-- equivalent to what was attained under the straight export subsidy program.&#13;
However, the export subsidy must be fully increased by the amount of the&#13;
production taxes, the domestic price is raised to c (or a) baht, and the net&#13;
loss to the economy is jgn plus bmk -- an increase in the net cost of blfk.&#13;
The Government revenue effect is agcd - bkcn; an effect which may be positive&#13;
and is very likely to imply less of a drain on Government revenue than the&#13;
straight export subsidy scheme.&#13;
2.30      Chart IV shows the domestic wholesale price of refined sugar, the&#13;
FOB price of raw sugar, and the export subsidy for the 1962-67 period. The&#13;
salient points on the operation of this system may be briefly summarized:&#13;
(a) the production tax subsidy system generated substantial revenue with only&#13;
81% of the 643 million baht collected being expanded on the revenue using&#13;
segment of the program; (b) while the sugar act of 1962 also called for expend-&#13;
itures on research and development, disease and pest control, distribution&#13;
of high yield varieties of sugarcane and low priced fertilizers, and provision&#13;
of credit, the great bulk of expenditure (87% of the total) was allocated for&#13;
the export subsidies; the high world price of sugar in 1964 led to both the&#13;
subsidy and the cess being lowered substantially and also caused an expansion&#13;
in cane production which became available just as the sugar slump of 1965&#13;
occurred -- a change in riarket conditions which made it difficult to find a&#13;
package of tax-subsidy rates that would both be self supporting and move the&#13;
large amounts of Thai sugar into world markets. In the face of less favorable&#13;
market conditions, a combined policy of selective export subsidies and a success-&#13;
ful appeal for access to the U.S. protected market through a share in the U.S.&#13;
quota managed to reduce the sugar surplus, but the excess supply was still too&#13;
great to be disposed of through an export subsidy acceptable to the Government.&#13;
The production cess-export subsidy system was repealed in 1966.&#13;
2.31      The period from the 1966 to the favorable change in the world&#13;
market situations in 1972 was characterized by production controls on exist-&#13;
ing factories, limits on the number of mills, entrance into the International&#13;
Sugar Organization, expansion of the U.S. quota, and entrance into long-term&#13;
contracts for the supply of sugar with leading sugar trading firms -- all&#13;
policies carried out by the Government in order to limit the excess supply&#13;
problem resulting from heavy protectionist policies and to try and encourage&#13;
greater stability in the industry.&#13;
2.32      The booming world markets of 1973 to 1976 led to a complete shift&#13;
in Government policies with heavy export taxes and domestic price ceilings&#13;

as opposed to price floors and export subsidies. A premium payment for export&#13;
licenses was introduced and over the 1974/75 period, one fifth of the total&#13;
value of exports was collected by the tax. This average premium during the&#13;
last half of 1974 was particularly high (averaging g 4 per kg) accounting&#13;
for 37% of the value of exports.&#13;
2.33       The decline in world market prices in 1976 and 1977, shown in&#13;
Chart III, has meant that the brief interlude with a sugar industry broadly&#13;
profitable at world prices passed fairly quickly.   The situation in the&#13;
beginning of 1977 is characterized by controls on expansion of sugar, complete&#13;
protection for the domestic market (although price controls are in effect),&#13;
low export subsidies on sugar exports, and a sugar reserve requirement for&#13;
sale of 7% of output at 10% below market prices to the Ministry of Commerce&#13;
for reselling to low income persons and Government officials.&#13;
2.44      While a large part of the rationale of Government policies towards&#13;
the sugar sector appears to have been geared to protecting the processing&#13;
plants (several of which were and are Government enter-,)rises), there has&#13;
also been intervention throughout this period in the market links between the&#13;
processing industries and the sugarcane producers. These policies have&#13;
reflected a concern for monopsony power -n the part of the sugar mills -- a&#13;
concern that has a somewhat greater a priori rationale than the corresponding&#13;
argument occasionally heard with respect to the rice sector. There are three&#13;
reasons for this. Firstly, there are only 41 refineries in the country as of&#13;
the beginning of 1977 compared to close to 10,000 rice mills. Secondly, the&#13;
sugarcane crops must be processed fairly soon after cutting or substantial&#13;
losses are incurred a factor which limits the flexibility of the cane growers&#13;
in seeking alternatives to the closest mill. 1/ Thirdly, there is often no&#13;
direct contact between the mills and small sugarcane farmers, and the effi-&#13;
ciency of the middleman activity between the mills and small farmers has been&#13;
questioned. In Thailand, mills typically advance money to sugarcane growers&#13;
providing mills with secure raw material inputs and the sugarcane growers with&#13;
working capital. A survey of sugar mills in 1974/75 indicated that virtually&#13;
all mills imposed minimum sugarcane requirements in quota contracts and&#13;
provided advance payments. TheRe requirements eliminate the possibility of&#13;
direct contracts with the factories for most sugarcane growers. Instead, they&#13;
must obtain contracts for sugarcane sale from the quotamen, typically large&#13;
farmers who sign delivery contracts with the mills. The quotamen not only&#13;
provide a middleman service on farming out the quotas but also advance loan&#13;
money to the small farmers 2/ often at annual interest rates of 20% or more.&#13;
1/   This factor is discussed in greater detail in Krisada Kirakul, Sugarcane&#13;
Procurement in the Eastern and Western Regions of Thailand, MA Thesis,&#13;
Thamasat, June 1975.&#13;
2/   While quotamen receive advance money from mills, this does not usually&#13;
match the size of loans extended to farmers. One study found that&#13;
quotamen loaned out at a rate of $ 400 a rai but received advance money&#13;
from mills at about B 160 a rai, see Krisada Kirakul, Sugarcane Procure-&#13;
ment in the Eastern and Western Regions of Thailand, MA Thesis, Thamasat,&#13;

2.35      The principal forr of ijnter7entiuon h-tas been with the setting of&#13;
cane prices. During the prd.ioni.l.'i  tax-export subsidy scheme in 1962-66,&#13;
minimum mill gate prices of the sugarcane were set on a regional basis by&#13;
the Government. This, hoite !er, was not totally ac:ep) '.le to the farmers&#13;
as transportation costs from the fauiL- to the wil.l coul.d be set by the mill&#13;
to provide a farm gate price 'iinpeied by the miliTnimu11 price regulations.&#13;
Associations of quotamen were formaed (in Kadnchaiiuabiuri in 1961 and in Chol-&#13;
buri in 1969) to bargin on the sugarcane prices. When the price floors&#13;
on cane were removed with the itpea1. of the 1962 3ugai'ca-Je act in 1966, a&#13;
formal bargaining process was carried out about a mornth before the harvest&#13;
season. The Government played a role in this pLoc:ess but it is difficult to&#13;
know if it had a substantive ihmpact or not. In any case, the Sugar Act of&#13;
1968 formally gave the "CommitLee for Policy, Counseling and for the Mainte-&#13;
nance of Price Level of SugaccaIe ai!d SugaV" the right to set the price of&#13;
cane. The mill gateprice is now set at g 300 per ton.&#13;
2.36      The Sugar Institute (MfiILi.L, of Industry) and the Bank of Agri-&#13;
cultural Cooperatives have also instituted progtams to provide loans at an&#13;

2.37      Rubber differs subsL a ;4ally fromu other crops in Thailauid in several&#13;
ways, it was introduced at a rluch Iatt:- date than rice or sugarcane -- the first&#13;
plantings occurred around 1913; it is only grown in the Southern part of the&#13;
country (90% of national production) and in areas close to the Cambodian border;&#13;
it dominates the agricultural cash incomes oEf SoutLhern rural households to a much&#13;
greater extent than any crop in any other region -- at the low prices of the&#13;
1960s, it still accounted for 4:';t of v_1e added by agrictiltural crops which in&#13;
turn accounted for 28/,; of the sutiLli's GDP; 1/ investments in rubber, because&#13;
trees are producti'.-e until an age of over 33 years, have a longer time horizon&#13;
than any of the other crops in Thailand; there is a greater known potential for&#13;
increasing yields in rubber than for any other sector in Thai agriculture --&#13;
yields with the modern clonal varieties give 90-110 kg rai in the first year&#13;
of production and from 220-330 kg/rai in peak years while much of the tradi-&#13;
tional Thai rubber yields less than 30 kg per rai in the first year and peak&#13;
yields are only 66 kg per rai.; 2/ and Government intervention in the sector&#13;
has been very limited up until the past decade when a rubber replanting programs&#13;
became significant and levels of taxation via export taxes (partially used to&#13;
finance the replanting) rose substantially due to higher prices and a tax&#13;
formula with a 50% marginal tax rate. Before discussing the nature of tax&#13;
intervention, developments in the rubber industry will be briefly summarized.&#13;

2.38      From 1913 through 1927, rubber spread rapidly under the incentive&#13;
of a gross return per rai far in excess of what could be obtained in rice.&#13;
Stifel has calculated gross returns to rubber were on the average 10 times&#13;
higher than in rice during this period. 1/ During the early depression&#13;
years, the planted area remained constant and production fell by more than&#13;
a half between 1929 and 1931 as prices declined. The drop in cash income was&#13;
reflected in a reduction of imports into the South from 0 26 million in 1930&#13;
to 0 8 million in 1933. 2/   From 1933 to 1941, production grew rapidly and&#13;
gross returns in rubber some 4.4 to 6.3 times the gross returns in rice led to&#13;
a jump in area planted that was to establish the base for the post war growth&#13;
of the industry.&#13;
2.39      In the immediate post war period, production recovered slowly due to a&#13;
combination of labor shortages and low rubber prices. The Korean war rubber&#13;
boom stimulated both rubber production and new plantings with some estimated&#13;
1.23 million rai planted between 1950-52 (roughly 15% of present rubber area).&#13;
Relatively favorable prices in 1955-57 and 1959-62 resulted in further spurts in&#13;
new plantings of 1.14 million rai (13% of present area) and 2.05 million rai&#13;
(24% of present area) respectively. The low prices after 1963 led to a decline&#13;
in the rate of planting to moderate rates which the official data show has&#13;
continued into the 1970s. However, much of the new planting is on areas cleared&#13;
from forest reserves and the statistics on this process are unreliable.&#13;
2.40      An effective presentation of the process of transition from a non-&#13;
commercialized rice economy to an export accounted rubber economy is evident&#13;
in the rising ratio of per capita area in rubber relative to a rice area per&#13;
capita that varied without any apparent trend (Table 15).&#13;

2.41      In recent years, rubber has declined in importance relative to both&#13;
the other crops discussed in this section and to the agricultural sector in&#13;
general.  The value of rubber at farm prices was 17% of the farm value of rice&#13;
and triple the farm value of sugarcane in 1969 but has declined to 9% of the&#13;
value of rice and to rough equality with sugarcane in 1974 (due to a very high&#13;

price of cane, the farm value of cane was double that of rubber in 1975).&#13;
Rubber accounted for over 20% of the value of exports in 1962 and only about&#13;
7% in 1975. The great importance of rubber results from the potential for&#13;
improved varieties in producing a crop with a brighter future than was&#13;
existed throughout the 1960s and from the apparent need for Government&#13;
assistance in this process.&#13;
2.42      The history of Government policy in rubber can be briefly summarized.&#13;
During the pre-World War II period, Thailand occasionally entered international&#13;
cartel arrangements aimed at supporting and stabilizing the world price but with&#13;
little effect on the cartels or on domestic developments (because of Thailand's&#13;
small share of world rubber markets and generally non-effective quota alloca-&#13;
tions.) 1/ In the 1930s, a 7% ad valorem export tax was levied on rubber&#13;
exports, a low level of taxation that was maintained until 1960. The tax&#13;
schedule was changed in 1960 to a sliding tax rate formula with rates starting&#13;
at 5% and rising to 20%. 2/ With the high levels of rubber prices in 1960,&#13;
this represented significantly higher rubber taxation (the $ 15 per kg average&#13;
prices of 1960 would be taxed at a 17% rate under the new schedules). However,&#13;
rubber prices drifted steadily lower and the tax rate was reduced to 10% in&#13;
1964/65/66 when prices averaged between 9 and 10 baht per kg. The latest&#13;
change in export taxation occurred in 1967 when the system was altered in order&#13;
to provide financing for a rubber replanting program. The tax was divided&#13;
between the traditional export tax and a cess -- an additional tax whose pro-&#13;
ceeds were directly fed into the replanting effort. The formula used in cal-&#13;
culating the export tax (d) and replanting cess (c) are:&#13;
d = .O1G                   if G &lt; 5.90&#13;
= .4 (G - 5.80)          if G &gt; 5.90&#13;
c = .5                     if G &lt;10&#13;
= (G-10) .1 + 5          if G &lt; 10&#13;
where G is a gazetted price used in calculating the tax.   These formula&#13;
in general imply higher tax rates than the 1960 schedule.   With a combined&#13;
marginal tax rate of 40% with a gazetted prices between 5.90 baht/kg and 10&#13;
baht/kg and 50% with prices above 10 baht/kg, differences are most pronounced at&#13;
higher prices. The tax rate at 8 baht/kg, 10 baht/kg and 15 baht per kg is 17%,&#13;
22% and 31% respectively in comparison to 9%, 11.5%, and 17% under the pre-1967&#13;
rates. The export tax alone has increased for higher prices, and in addition&#13;
the replanting cess has been added on. Since a gazetted price of 15 baht/kg was&#13;
in effect for two months in 1974, the high 31% tax rate on the gazetted price&#13;
mentioned above is not simply a hypothetical example. 3/ The actual level of&#13;
taxation applied on the rubber sector is defined in Table 16 with the cess and&#13;
1/   In 1939, the Government agreed to a quota that would have significantly&#13;
affected export growth, but protests from the South led eventually to a&#13;
revised non-binding quota (see L. Stifle, ibid., p. 1).&#13;
2/   Tax data was obtained from the Bank Thailand.&#13;
3/   Since the gazetted price is set below FOB prices at higher prices, these&#13;
examples overstate the tax as a rate of the FOB price to some extent.&#13;

export tax components separated out. While taxes were only slightly above the&#13;
historical rates prior to 1973, the taxes have been at average rates of from&#13;
15% to almost 20% since then. For the whole period 1968-76, the combined&#13;
taxes were about 15% of the total export value.&#13;
2.43      It is useful to calculate the impact of a 15% tax burden on the&#13;
farm value of rubber produced. To this end, the ratio of total exports&#13;
to total production was calculated for the 1968-75 period (97%). 1/ This&#13;
was multiplied by the aggregate farm value of rubber calculated for the&#13;
1967/68 to 1975/76 period (16,819.5 million baht) to get a farm value of&#13;
rubber destined for exports of 16,314 million baht. 2/ The total tax burden&#13;
identified in Table 16 amounts to 25% of this farm value.  The structure&#13;
of rubber prices can be built up from these ratios. A 15% tax burden on&#13;
the export value implies an ex-factory price slightly below 85% of the export&#13;
price. If this 15% is equivalent to a 25% burden on the farm value of the&#13;
exported rubber, farm gate prices must be 60% of FOB prices and about 70% of&#13;
ex-factory prices. A 30% margin on marketing and processing rubber from the&#13;
farm to the point of shipment is higher than required in rice, but the&#13;
processing activity is more costly as well.  A farm price this close to the&#13;
ex-factory price is apparently high by world standards, 3/ and supports the&#13;
conclusion arrived at by moru micro-economic studies of the marketing and&#13;
processing chain. 4/  If marketing margins are competitive (as the evidence&#13;
suggests), the higher 20% tax on exports noted for the more recent years&#13;
translates into a 36% tax on the farm value.  While some of the burden of&#13;
higher taxes may in fact be absorbed at higher levels in the chain, this can&#13;
hardly be substantial enough to effect this result significantly. The high&#13;
marginal tax rates combined with rising prices are substantially increasing&#13;
the tax borne by rubber holders. On the basis of the World Bank price&#13;
projections, the existing tax rates, and estimates of margins consistent with&#13;
those outlined here, the World Bank projects a level of taxation on the farm&#13;
value of rubber at a 54% rate by the end of the century. 5/ Even though a&#13;
fifth of this would be returned to the sector through the replanting cess,&#13;
this implies very stiff tax rates well above projections of farmgate tax&#13;
rates for other agricultural products.&#13;
2.44      The most significant intervention in rubber aside from taxation,&#13;
occurs through the rubber replanting program. The situation with respect&#13;

to rubber replanting in Thailand is set out in Table 17 and 18 which show&#13;
areas where replanting is required and the extent of the replanting program&#13;
to date. Since rubber planting was not extensive between 1941 and 1950,&#13;
the figures given in Table 18 based on planting prior to 1941 are fairly&#13;
accurate for required replanting area. At least 30% of the present rubber&#13;
area needed to be replanted over the last decade and a half. Due to a rapid&#13;
increase in replanting in the 1970s, some 36% of this area has been replanted,&#13;
about 11% of the total area in rubber.&#13;
2.45      There are two main problems with respect to the replanting effort.&#13;
First, the rate of replanting will have to increase substantially if the&#13;
backlog of senescent trees are to be cleared before the 1.23 million rai&#13;
planted in 1950-52 need replanting in the early 1980s. 1/ Second, and&#13;
perhaps of much greater concern, is the fact that replanting is still&#13;
accounting for less than half of new rubber being introduced in the South.&#13;
The majority of new planting is in traditional seedling rubber rather than&#13;
the high yielding clones. While the Rubber Research Center had estimated&#13;
growth in new planting at a rate of 140,000 rai per year from 1966 to 1973 (a&#13;
rate considerably above that observed until very recent years in the replanting&#13;
effort), this may well underestimate the spread of the low-yield rubber. A&#13;
detailed study of rubber as part of a regional planning study for the South&#13;
led to an estimate of new plantings at the rate of 200,000 rai per year from&#13;
1966 to 1973. 2/ The implications of this estimate is that 72% of the&#13;
immature rubber in 1973 resulted from new planting of almost entirely&#13;
low-yield seedling rubber.&#13;
2.46      The present financing of the rubber replanting program precLudes&#13;
the use of replanting grants other than for existing holders who have pre-&#13;
sumably borne part of the burden of the -ubber cess. However, much of the&#13;
areas replanted have been largely unproductive during periods when the cess&#13;
has been in effect and the replanting program should be thought of as loans&#13;
to be recaptured through the cess tax on future production of rubber or a&#13;
separate program aimed at providing high yield clonal rubber to new planters&#13;
should be instituted. The social returns available with the high yield&#13;
rubber may even make it economical to replant rubber before it is senescent&#13;
-- it is a serious failure, given the role in introducing the high yield&#13;
rubber that has been preempted by the public sector, that sQ little impact&#13;
has been made or attempted with respect to new plantings. 3/&#13;

aggregate farm value now accounts for 13% of the total value of crops in&#13;
agriculture, over a quarter of the value of crops other than rice, and&#13;
over a fifth of the total value of exports. Even less interference has&#13;
occurred in the oil seeds, other fiber crops, fruits, and vegetable crops.&#13;
While these issues will not be analyzed in detail, the description of Govern-&#13;
ment intervention in agricultural markets will be completed with a brief&#13;
summary of the more important policies affecting these activities.&#13;
2.48      With a farm value over 5 billion baht in 1975, maize is the second&#13;
most important crop after rice. The Bank of Thailand sometimes provides&#13;
financial services to corn growers, the office of the Board of Industrial&#13;
promotion provides services on marketing intelligence and technical advice&#13;
to corn exporters, the Board of Trade has entered into some contracts for&#13;
supplying corn to Japan, and a small scale price support program has been&#13;
experimented with by the Marketing Organization for Farmers. 1/ This last&#13;
organization, a Government enterprise, intervened in 1975 to buy 6,500&#13;
tons of corn at the guaranteed price of 2,300 baht per ton.  The Government&#13;
has also entered into trade contracts, initially in order to avoid the&#13;
non-fulfillment of contracts common to earlier periods. A complicated&#13;
process has been introduced whereby the Government negotiates contracts with&#13;
Japan and Taiwan and then allocates quotas based on past export sales. There&#13;
are around 180 firms on the books, but it is difficult to break through the&#13;
maze surrounding these agreements to arrive at any simple conclusions on the&#13;
system. Even official export shares may be misleading as export quotas can&#13;
be transferred to other firms.&#13;
2.49      There has been a phenomenal growth in cassava production over the last&#13;
two years which has seen it spread from Changwats east of Bangkok through wide&#13;
areas of the Northeast. The growth of the cassava sector has been of some&#13;
concern to Government authorities as it is believed to lead to deterioration of&#13;
the soil. The Ministry of Industry had a restriction limiting the location of&#13;
cassava processing plants to six Changwats. However, due to the heavy protection&#13;
of grains in the European Common Market, a mixture of soybean and cassava has&#13;
become very competitive in North Europe as animal feed. This has led to a&#13;
booming export market which has seen all restrictions swept aside in a proces&lt;&#13;
resulting in a rapid substitution of cassava for kenaf and a tremendous expansion&#13;
of new areas into a crop that is simple to plant, grow, and harvest and which&#13;
requires little labor. The quality of exports was often debased by weight&#13;
increasing addition of sand (etc.) but the move towards tighter controls for&#13;
this reason has almost been made redundant by European firms taking over the&#13;
final shipping phase of the cassava trade.&#13;
2.50      Kenaf has declined rapidly in the face of the brighter prospects&#13;
(at least temporarily) for cassava. There are plans to use kenaf as pulp&#13;
in a paper industry and given its rapid decline, corresponding plans to&#13;
encourage its production if this project goes through. While this should&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-70-&#13;
be left to market forces, there is pressure to shift industry into the&#13;
Northeast and a corresponding discussion of Government programs to support&#13;
the kenaf processing sector.&#13;
2.51      There are import tariffs and business taxes on cotton (32.3%)&#13;
and tobacco (67.7%) in Thailand, but these give limited information on&#13;
any protectiont since processed cotton is exported and there are substantial&#13;
quality differences between the imported and Thai tobaccos, about 57% of&#13;
which was exported in 1975. Price comparisons have been used for cotton&#13;
in the work reported in part B of this section.&#13;
2.52      There are also instances where the Government has entered inter-&#13;
national trade agreements on minor crops, the fulfillment of which has&#13;
led to the imposition of trade controls. An example is a recent restriction&#13;
temporarily limiting exports of laam jaak to the Singapore market. But&#13;
these restrictions emerge and fade, often with important local impacts,&#13;
but with little impact relative to the interventions in the major crops.&#13;
2.53      In summary, except for rice, a heavy protection of sugar, and&#13;
heavy taxation of rubber partially offset by a replanting prograrw, the&#13;
Thai agricultural sector is relatively free from the market controls and&#13;
interventions. Even in domestic rice and rubber markets, few quantitative&#13;
controls have been imposed.&#13;
Agricultural Inputs&#13;
2.54      Government policies towards agricultural inputs other than labor,&#13;
land and water are of minor significance since these inputs are either&#13;
used to a limited extent in Thai agriculture and/or are not significantly&#13;
affected by market intervenitions. As quantified in Appendix B, import&#13;
restrictions on agricultural machinery and chemical imports are low. One&#13;
exception to this is, however, worth noting. From 1968-73, the Chemferco&#13;
plant at Mae Moh producing nitrogen based fertilizer was heavily protected by&#13;
meains of a Chemferco monopoly ouL imports of straight nitrogen based fertilizers.&#13;
Studies of the impact of this protection are available elsewhere 1/ -- the&#13;
mnin points of which are briefly summarized: (a) the monopoly led to retail&#13;
r ices for nitrogen based fertilizers that appear to have been some 68% above&#13;
free market prices; (b) this inflation of fertilizer prices in combination&#13;
with the price depressing effects of taxation on rice limited the growth of&#13;
fertilizer use; and (c) fertilizer imports were distorted into mixed or&#13;
non-nitrogen based fertilizers not subject to monopoly control. There has&#13;
also been a long standing policy of specific Government subsidies to fertilizers&#13;
-- a policy that has been given greater impetus since significant shares of&#13;
agriculture taxes are now directly and automatically allocated to Government&#13;
farmers' assistance programs. However, it is very difficult to quantify the&#13;
impact of these subsidy programs. Often the assistance is in the form of&#13;
loans which have not been paid back even though a legal obligation technically&#13;
remain-n. The fertilizer price distortions, since they have been either&#13;

removed or are very specific to particular crops and areas, will not be analyzed&#13;
here. The detailed cost data for crops given in Annex B does show, however,&#13;
that unless the degree of fertilizer use changes very substantially, the potential&#13;
for input price distortions affecting profitability of diffe-ent crops is minor&#13;
relative to the product price distortions.&#13;
2.55      The zero cost supply of water from irrigation facilities is an&#13;
important subsidy to the agricultural sector. Since these costs are specific&#13;
to particular irrigation facilities, little can be said at a general level.&#13;
However, in the work on private and economic profitability in different crops,&#13;
a methodology used for estimating water costs that was used in study on&#13;
production costs in seven irrigated areas in Thailand is adopted to analyze&#13;
the impact of the subsidized water supplies relative to miarket distortions&#13;
for outputs and other inputs. The methodology on water pricing is discussed&#13;
in Appendix B.&#13;
2.56      An important distortion for Thai agricultural results because of the&#13;
market wage rate is dependent on product market interventions in agriculture&#13;
that affect the opportunity cost of labor. This has had an important effect&#13;
given the size of the distortions to rice prices and the role of rice in the&#13;
production patterns of barely commercialized farmers who, it can be argued,&#13;
bsor-b the impact of changes in the demand for labor from thle more commercialized&#13;
sectors of the economy. 1/ By distorting market prices for agricultural products&#13;
below their accounting prices, the project market interventions undervalue the&#13;
output foregone by labor drawn into alternative employment. It is this effect&#13;
which leads to a substantial subsidy to all labor using activities which partly&#13;
offsets the disincentives implied by product taxation in rice production and&#13;
which implies an important input subsidy to other agricultural and non-agricultural&#13;
activities. The nature of the market wage adjustments implied by the effect is&#13;
quantified in Appendix B.&#13;
B. Resource Allocation Affects&#13;
2.57      In part A of this section, Government interventions in the agri-&#13;
cultural sector have been described. We now consider some of the resource&#13;
allocation of these policies. A starting point is the measurement of the&#13;
effects of market interventions on private and economic profitability across&#13;
different agricultural activities. The summary measures used are based on&#13;
calculating: (a) market and economic returns per unit of land under different&#13;
crops; (b) the nominal rate of protection defined as the percentage by which&#13;
the actual product prices at the farm gate differs from the appropriate&#13;
accounting prices which are linked to border prices 2/ for trading commodities&#13;
following a methodology outlined in Appendix B; (c) the effective rate of&#13;
I/   The difficulties involved in assumptions required to estimate the oppor-&#13;
tunity costs of factors are discussed in the section on shadow wage rates&#13;
in section I (part A) and in Appendix B.&#13;
2/   Possible qualifications to this assumption are discussed in part A of&#13;
this section for rice and in Annex B for sugarcane. The use of border&#13;
prices as measures of shadow or accounting prices is discussed in Annex B.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-72-&#13;
protection defined as the distortion between the returns to the primary factors&#13;
of production, libor and land, with all products and other factors evaluated at&#13;
accounting prices relative to the returns obtained at market prices; and (d) the&#13;
distortion to the rate of return to land with all products and all other factors&#13;
evaluated at accounting prices -- an extension to the effective rate calculation&#13;
made possible by estimates of the accounting wage rate. A fifth measure, the&#13;
domestic resource cost criterion, is analyzed in detail in Appendix C.&#13;
2.58      These summary measures are presented in Tables 19 and 20 for different&#13;
regions of the country as defined in Appendix B and for different crops using&#13;
both traditional or existing techniques of production and modern techniques that&#13;
requires more intensive use of chemical inputs, improved seed varieties, and&#13;
especially improved water control.&#13;
2.59      The use of summary measures of economic profitability effectively&#13;
in an analysis of the agricultural sector is not an easy task. The use of&#13;
single estimates of the different measures is not satisfactory since the&#13;
variance between yields, product quality, and inputs is so great that point&#13;
estimates have little meani.r. The calculation of these measures for a great&#13;
many crops in a great many regions of the country leads to such a large col-&#13;
lection of estimates that it is difficult to present it effectively and&#13;
the limited generality of some of the results become painfully obvious.&#13;
2.60      The propositions that do appear to be supported by these summary&#13;
measures will be briefly outlined to give some background to the following&#13;
discussion. First, the impact of product price distortions on rice (in these&#13;
examples around 40%) translates into a substantial disincentive measured by&#13;
market returns in land that undervalue the economic returns by some 50-75%.&#13;
Second, the rice distortions lead to market returns to land that are generally&#13;
around 100-300 baht per rai, substantially below returns that can be obtained&#13;
from biannual upland crops or combinations of short season crops. Third, aside&#13;
from the significant levels of product price distortions for non-traded goods&#13;
with prices linked closely to rice (vegetables #22, chewing cane in the North-&#13;
east #7), the only other significant crop with product prices depressed by&#13;
market interventions is rubber (#71). Significantly protected crops include&#13;
sugarcane (#38, #56) which was discussed in detail in part A and cotton (#44,&#13;
#45, #33, #34) which benefits from import tariffs on inputs into the tradeable&#13;
industry and even here the nominal protection is low. Fourth, distortions to&#13;
returns to land and the effective rate of protection measures show that products&#13;
with low nominal rates of protection have low distortions to the rates of&#13;
returns on land and low effective rates of protection -- a result mainly of the&#13;
offsetting effects of the rice distortions on wage costs and minor levels of&#13;
protection on chemical and machinery costs. Fifth, the incentives on returns to&#13;
land in the protected crops is substantial (note cotton #44, #33, #34; sugarcane,&#13;
#38, #56), a result explained by the combined effect or returns to land caused&#13;
by the moderate nominal protection plus the impact of rice taxation in depressing&#13;
the market cost of labor.&#13;
2.61      The data on modern techniques is rather suspect as it is based&#13;
on results obtained on experiment stations which often exceed results ob-&#13;
tained in farmers' fields. Nevertheless, they are useful for two main&#13;
reasons. Firstly, they reflect the limited extent of technical progress in&#13;

Thai agriculture with an apparent good potential for agricultural progress&#13;
built on improved crop varieties, chemical inputs, and water control. Secondly,&#13;
the costing of water in the crop budgets in Appendix B allows the incentives&#13;
provided by zero cost supplies of water to be taken into account. With nominal&#13;
distortions for most of the upland and garden crops, this translates into&#13;
significant subsidization of these activities reflected in the positive distor-&#13;
tions to rates of return to land in the water control areas. It also shows that&#13;
while the water subsidy effect for rice is substantial, it is still dominated by&#13;
the product price effects at least with market prices reduced by as much as 40%&#13;
by the export taxation.&#13;
2.62      The resource allocational effects of some of the market interven-&#13;
tions in Thai agriculture seem quite clear based on the discussion in part A&#13;
and the results on private and social profitability. In the South, interfer-&#13;
ence prior to the war was very limited for both rice and rubber so that no&#13;
great importance can be attributed to the role of the Government in the&#13;
expansion of rubber. The heavy post war interference with rice prices&#13;
probably gave some stimulus to the spurt in rubber planting that occurred in&#13;
the 1950s. The depressed rice price may also have affected rubber output&#13;
through the intensity of tapping activities. However, by the post war&#13;
period, rubber was already in a dominant position as a cash crop and the&#13;
importance of the relative returns to rice vis-a-vis rubber were less signif-&#13;
icant compared to the pre-war period. 1/ The increased taxation of rubber&#13;
and reduced taxation of rice in the mid 1970s may have some impact on produc-&#13;
tion decisions, but such effects are likely to be minor. The more favorable&#13;
returns offered in high yielding rubber will dominate any foreseeable tax&#13;
effects. A substantial impact will result from the replanting program, but&#13;
the evaluation of this program is beyond the scope of this present study.&#13;
2.63      The protectionist policies have been very important in maintaining&#13;
a viable sugar industry during the post war period. These can be little&#13;
doubt chat sugarcane would not have risen to its position as one of the&#13;
leading crops in Thailand without the combined protection to cane and heavy&#13;
taxation of rice. The prospects for the future are less clear. At projected&#13;
prices for the future (which are generally above the 1960s prices in real&#13;
terms), the gap between Thai costs of production and world price levels may&#13;
not be very great and, with improved yields in irrigated areas, the sugarcane&#13;
sector may become viable without protection.&#13;
2.64      The major impact on allocational decisions has come in the rice&#13;
sector relative to upland crops and non-agricultural activities. The heavy&#13;
taxation of rice has greatly reduced its attractiveness as a cash crop&#13;
(as reflected in Table 19) and stimulated both the diversification of agri-&#13;
culture and the growth of the non-agricultural sector. 2/ The extent of this&#13;
transaction has been discussed in section I with reference to patterns of land&#13;
1/   L. Stifel's work on rubber confirms this as the paddy price variable in&#13;
an explanation of rubber production is insignificant in the post war&#13;
period. See L. Stifel, The Growth of the Rubber Economy of Southern&#13;
Thailand (draft - undated).&#13;
2/   This latter affects operating through the affect of depressed rice&#13;
prices on the supply price of labor.&#13;

utilization. Some further evidence on the rapid transformation encouraged&#13;
by the rice policies is given in Table 21 and 22. Table 21 shows that Thailand&#13;
despite the rapid withdrawal of Burma from world markets, has experienced a&#13;
steady decline in its share of world exports. Table 22 shows that the rice&#13;
sector has experienced a corresponding decline in the surplus over domestic&#13;
demands. There are two factors that have prevented an even more rapid decline&#13;
in rice during the periods of heavy taxation. Firstly, even with a substantially&#13;
lower return than is available from other crops, farmers are very reluctant to&#13;
reduce rice production below on-farm consumption needs. This is partly explained&#13;
by an aversion to risk. In less commercialized regions, limited marketing&#13;
possibilities for cash crops are another factor. The second reason is that it&#13;
is very difficult to grow anything but rice in many areas of the country during&#13;
the wet season. Few crops are as flood resistant as rice and no significant&#13;
crops can survive the heavy flooding in areas where 'floating' rice is grown.&#13;
Since Thai Agriculture has developed around flooding river basins with the most&#13;
fertile soils, areas where substitution possibilities are limited by water&#13;
conditions are important in total cultivated area.&#13;
2.65      In areas with less substantial flood problems along the higher&#13;
levels on the edges of the Chao Phya basin and in parts of Northeast, a&#13;
shift into the uplanid crops -- particularly maize, kenaf, and sugarcane&#13;
-- has occurred at a rapid rate.&#13;
2.66      While this diversification has been viewed as one of the main&#13;
benefits of the rice taxation policies, this appears to be based on an a&#13;
priori assumption that a diversified agriculture is preferable to a special-&#13;
ized economy. With their on farm consumption requirements for rice satisfied,&#13;
farmers become flexible in seeking out the most profitable cash crops. Rice&#13;
evaluated at appropriate accounting prices can hold its own against many&#13;
alternative crop possibilities. It is hard to see why the agricultural&#13;
sector has benefited by eliminating one of the main options among potential&#13;
cash crops. Furthermore, the diversification has been obtained through&#13;
policies that have worsened the distribution of income by transferring&#13;
substantial resources from the agricultural to non-agricultural sector.&#13;

APPENDIX A: REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THAILAND&#13;
1.       The basic geographical divisions in Thailand consist of the North,&#13;
the Central, the Northeast, and the South (see Map 1). The changwats&#13;
(provinces) of Thailand, further grouped into a narrower ten region break-&#13;
down that is used occasionally in this report, are listed in Table 1. The&#13;
north contairns a third of the total land area of Thailand but only a fifth&#13;
of the area in farm holdings. The Region is mountainous with four major&#13;
rivers (The Ping, Nang, Yom, and Nan). 1/ The river valleys account for&#13;
most of the agricultural production in the region. Predominant soil types&#13;
are loam, sandy loam, and clay. The clay soils are concentrated in the&#13;
valleys with moderate to high fertility and poor drainage. Paddy yields tend&#13;
to be substantially higher than in other regions of the country. In 1973,&#13;
average yields were almost a third above the national average and 15% above&#13;
those in the Central Plain. 2/   Small scale irrigation projects have a long&#13;
history in Northern Thailand. Irrigation and power facilities have been&#13;
constructed on the Ping (Bhumiphol Dam) and the Nan (the Sirikit Dam). The&#13;
role and potential of irrigavted agriculture are discussed in section I.&#13;
2.        The four Northern rivers join to form the Chao Phya River at Nakhon&#13;
Sawan. The Central Region contains a fifth of the land area of Thailand and&#13;
a little more than a fifth of land in farm holdings. It includes the flat&#13;
flood plains and the Delta of the Chao Phya and its distributaries, the&#13;
Suphan, Noi and Lopburi Rivers. The Pasak river (joining the Chao Phya at&#13;
Ayutthaya), the Bang Pakong (East of Chao Phya), the Mai Kiong (to the West&#13;
of the Chao Phya), and the Petchburi complete the river system of the Central&#13;
Region.  The large flat plain, flooded anr.ni-ally by these rivers, is the main&#13;
source of Thailand's rice surplus. Soils are extreme clay with a high level&#13;
of fertility but poor drainage.   Since rainfall accounts for only a half to&#13;
two thirds of the water required for rice, 3/ the annual flooding is vital to&#13;
the area's rice production and also limits crop alternatives in the flood&#13;
plain except on the higher levees. Outside the main flood plains, loam and&#13;
sandy loam prevail with both good and poor drainage and with slight to high&#13;
alkaline effects in some regions. On the average, rice yields are about 10%&#13;
above the national average, 4/ but there is considerable variance across soil&#13;

soil types. The Central Region has the most developed irrigation facilites&#13;
in the country. The Chao Phya Irrigation project covers, in its Northern and&#13;
Southern parts, around 5.7 million rai and is one of the world's largest&#13;
water control systems. Major water control projects also are being developed&#13;
for the liai Klong river system. 1/&#13;
3.        The Northern plateau is separated from the Central Plain by a&#13;
series of low mountain ranges. The region is similar in size to the North&#13;
containing a third of the total area but it has a higher ratio of cultivated&#13;
to total land accounting or 44% of the nation's total farm land. The plateau&#13;
is very flat and traversed by the Chi and Mun rivers which, flowing in a&#13;
southeasterly direction, join near Ubon before flowing into the Mekong.&#13;
While annual flooding occurs in the river valleys, these areas are much&#13;
smaller in relation to the total area than in the Central Plain. The dominant&#13;
soil is loam and sandy loam with low fertility. Paddy yields are significantly&#13;
below the national average (some 18% below in 1973 2/).&#13;
4.        Southern Thailand consists of the peninsula solith of Changwat&#13;
Prachuab Kirikhan. It contains 14% of the total land area and 13% of total&#13;
farm land. The rivers in the area are shorter than systems other parts of&#13;
the country. The Pattani and Ta Pi-Phun Daang flow north into the Gulf of&#13;
Siam and the Tray flows south into the Adaman Sea. The soils are again sandy&#13;
loan with clay based soils in some areas. The region is mountainous with&#13;
limted areas well suited to rice. The 20th Century has seen a large scale&#13;
shift V rubber production in most areas of the South.    Rice yields tend on&#13;
the avei'age to be the lowest in the nation (some 30% below the national&#13;
average in 1973 3/), Irrigation as in the North, plays a small role in&#13;
agriculture at the present time. The limited potential is centered around&#13;
development of the Pattani and Ta Pi-Phun Daang rivers and possibly through&#13;
use of the lake at Songkhla. 4/&#13;
5.        The annual monsoons define a rainy season that lasts from May&#13;
through October in the North, Northeast and Central regions. The months of&#13;
Novemnbe^ through February are dry and slightly cooler than other periods.&#13;
The months of March through April are dry and hot. Agricultural activity is&#13;
limited in the February through March period except in the relatively small&#13;
areas with dry season water control. Rainfall in the south is limited during&#13;
the Dece-nbe2r through February period but is more evenly distributed over the&#13;
rest of the year. Rainfall is also considerably greater in the South varying&#13;
from 2,000 to 4,000 mm/year relative to 1,200 to 1,800 experienced in most&#13;
other regi.rons of the country. 5/&#13;

6.        The distribution of the Thai population is summarized in Table 2.&#13;
The data in Table 2 gives population by a regional breakdown slightly more&#13;
disaggregated than the four regional breakdown used in describing the geo-&#13;
graphy of the country; the Eastern Plateau contains almost all of the North-&#13;
east, the Northern Ranges corresponds to the North, the Central Plain and the&#13;
Southeastern Upland and Coastal Plains covers an area slightly larger than&#13;
the Central Region, while the Southern Ranges and Southern Coastal Plain&#13;
correspond to the South. There has been a substantial growth in the Thai&#13;
population during the past half century at a rate of about 2% a year up&#13;
until 1950 and a rate around 3% for the past two decades. Despite the rapid&#13;
change in total population, the regional breakdown has reraained remarkably&#13;
stable. Very little change of any kind is recorded prior to the 1960's.&#13;
During the 1960's there was a noticeable decline in the population share&#13;
of the inner Central Plain with virtually all ol this change reflected in&#13;
the growth of population in the Eastern Plateau. While population data must&#13;
be interpreted with caution, this seems to reflect a movement of population&#13;
in search of new land from the densely populated agricultural heart of the&#13;
country into especially the far Northern areas of the Northeast where very&#13;
large increases in land under cultivation have been recorded. The variance&#13;
in population density is substantial but this largely reflects the mountainous&#13;
nature of much of the Northern and Souther:n ranges and the high urbanization&#13;
rate in the inner Central Plain inclusive of Bangkok-Thonburi.&#13;

DATA ON THAI AGRICULTURE USED IN ECONOMIC AND PRIVATE PROFITABILITY&#13;
ANALYSIS AND THE PROCEDURES FOR ESTIMATING ACCOUNTING AND MARKET PRICES&#13;
1.        This annex reports on the data base for the calculation of summary&#13;
measures of market intervention and economic profitability in Section II (part&#13;
B). This work has benefitted to a great extent from an analysis of production&#13;
costs in irrigation areas throughout Thailand carried out as part of a multi-&#13;
country study by the Committee for Co-ordination of Investigations of the Lower&#13;
Mekong Basin during 1973 and 1974.1/&#13;
2.        The Mekong Committee study was aimed at measuring the costs of&#13;
production at accounting prices in agricultural activities with an emphasis&#13;
on accounting for irrigation water that is an important factor in introducing&#13;
more modern agricultural techniques. The methodology on water costs is discussed&#13;
below. The study also provides extensive data on the accounting prices of&#13;
products based on border prices for all traded commodities and prices cleaned of&#13;
all tax elements for non-traded commodities. Our work draws heavily on this&#13;
work. However, alternative assumptions used in the Mekong Committee analysis as&#13;
opposed to the present study are of sufficient importance that the cost side for&#13;
agricultural production differs greatly. Numerous adjustments were carried out,&#13;
which are briefly described before the data is presented. The details of our&#13;
approach for estimating accounting prices is then discussed.&#13;
The Data Base&#13;
3.        The most important difference between the Mekong Committee's work&#13;
and our study is the treatment of labor costs, which in turn is the most&#13;
important single cost in most activities. As noted in Section I the Mekong&#13;
Committee widely adopted the zero or low shadow wage rate argument based on&#13;
alledged unemployment and underemployment and complete disregard for the&#13;
product price distortions on the evaluation of the opportunity cost of labor.&#13;
It is quite probable that this argument has been overemphasized in development&#13;
economics in general. There is no doubt that this has been so for Thailand&#13;
in particular. Our alternative procedure for accounting pricing labor accounts&#13;
for the significant impact of agricultural taxation policies on the accounting&#13;
price of labor.&#13;
4.        A second difference is that the effect of Government market inter-&#13;
ventions on the differences between market and economic profitability is not&#13;
explicity accounted for in the Mekong Committee's study. This is one of the&#13;
aspects of market interventions which is emphasized in our study.&#13;
1/ Committee for Co-Ordination of Investigations of the Lower Mekong&#13;
Basin (hereafter the Mekong Committee), Production Costs for a Number&#13;
of Agricultural Products in the Lower Mekong Basin, (mimeo, December&#13;
1974). I am indebted to H. Van de Liere and especially Lorretta&#13;
Soan in providing access to the Mekong Committee's work and for their&#13;
time in discussing aspects of the research reported in this study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-90-&#13;
5.        Finally, adjustments were also made to the data based on data collected&#13;
by the input-output section of NESDB. The adjustments for all three of the&#13;
above purposes were too numerous to be fully described. The data must therefore&#13;
be interpreted as having descended from a wide series of evaluations an\d surveys&#13;
with many checks on alternative sources being carried out. The Mekong Committee&#13;
study, nevertheless, has been the main source for data.&#13;
6.        The basic procedure on border prices by the Mekong Committee was&#13;
to forecast beyond the period in which their study was carried out. This&#13;
approach has been adopted here, although the passage of time has allowed&#13;
improvements. The market interventions resulting in the measured price differ-&#13;
entials were basically due to trade taxes, business taxes, and municipal taxes.&#13;
7.        Several comments may clarify the nature of the following crop state-&#13;
ments; the traditional techniques are based on observations of existing techniques&#13;
in which considerable confidence can be placed, although wide variation across&#13;
crop statements is common reflecting variations in the quality of soil and&#13;
water conditions; the modern Lechniques are from projected developments in&#13;
project appraisals and these can be expected to be less reliable and typically&#13;
optimistic; occasionally price differentials occur when the nominal rate&#13;
is zero - this reflects the impact of distortions to farm gate prices due to&#13;
inflated transportation costs and is accounted for in the effective rate&#13;
calculation since it is best viewed as tax on an input; the return to land is&#13;
a residual in all cases obtained by subtracting all other costs from the&#13;
value of output; price distortions for some non-traded goods such as chewing&#13;
cane and low quality tobacco in the market produced for on-farm consumption&#13;
reflect the effects of the heavy rice taxation; the rainfed rice, Tha Bo, Ban&#13;
Mo and tank irrigation projects are all small scale schemes in the Northeast,&#13;
the Uttaradit and Phitsanulok areas are large scale irrigation areas for&#13;
planned development in the North; the Mae Klong basin region is an area with&#13;
some irrigation scheduled for substantial expansion in the Central Region east&#13;
of the Chao Phya River; Patanni is a potential irrigation area in the South.&#13;
Accounting and Market Prices for Transportation, Selected Agricultural Inputs,&#13;
Paddy Prices, Labor Costs, and Water Costs&#13;
8.        The following sections describe procedures used in estimating distor-&#13;
tions between market and accounting prices for the main items entering into the&#13;
crop statements.&#13;
(1) Transportation Costs&#13;
9.        Our adjustments to transportation costs will be based on an analysis&#13;
of heavy truck transportation on highways and light truck transportation on feeder&#13;
roads, the predominant modes of transportation for agricultural produce in Thai-&#13;
land.l/ The market and accounting costs are given in Table 1 and Table 2.&#13;

10.       The most important taxes leading to the distortions between market&#13;
and accounting prices in transportation are a .30 baht import duty and a .13 baht&#13;
business and municipal tax per liter on fuel oil, an 8% import duty and 7.7%&#13;
business and municipal tax on tires and parts, and a 40% import duty and 7.7%&#13;
business and municipal tax on trucks. The adjustment for wages, insurance, and&#13;
other costs are due to the undervaluation of labor costs due to the effects of&#13;
trade interferences, particularly the export restrictions on rice.&#13;

llb       Additional real resource costs are incurred from incremental costs&#13;
on the road network due to transportation activities. These costs are estimated&#13;
at .039 $ per ton km for heavy trucl:s on highways and 0.059 B per ton for light&#13;
trucks on feeder roads.1J&#13;
12.       Adding these costs gives an accounting price of 1 .33 and 1 .79&#13;
per ton km by heavy and light trucks respectively. With corresponding&#13;
market prices of $ .36 and 1 .90 per ton km, this implies a 9% distortion&#13;
between market and accounting prices for heavy trucks and a 14% distortion&#13;
for light trucks.  The figure for heavy trucks is an underestimate since&#13;
tolls (both formal and informal) are charged on some roads so that market costs&#13;
of road use are higher. Lack of data makes it difficult to quantify this,&#13;
but it would be reasonable to assume that the 9% distortion may be raised to&#13;
about 10%. For some of the calculations in the text, the absolute accounting&#13;
prices for the trucking component of transport costs will be used. At other&#13;
times, an 13% adjustment will be used on the basis of a 10% distortion on&#13;
heavy trucks, a 19% distortion on light trucks, and a .75 weight to heavy&#13;
trucks.&#13;
(2) Chemical Inputs in Agriculture&#13;
13.       Fertilizers:  In section II (part A), the nature of the controls on&#13;
fertilizer imports and the effects on fertilizer prices (especially for straight&#13;
nitrogen) were discussed. The Chemferco monopoly on area ammonium sulphate&#13;
imports led to domestic retail prices some 60-68% higher than estimated free&#13;
trade competitive prices. Domestic price data for fertilizers after mid 1968&#13;
when the Chemferco monopoly was established and before December 1973 when all&#13;
import controls on fertilizers were removed would have to be adjusted for the&#13;
effects of the import restrictions. However, for 1974 and later, the taxation&#13;
on fertilizer inputs have been negligible. While considerable subsidies have&#13;
been given under farmer's aid programs financed out of the Farmer's Aid Fund,&#13;
these have mostly been in the form of loans to purchase fertilizer which have&#13;
never been repaid. These are ignored in our calculations as price data obtained&#13;
fror studies of farm production costs wouldn't have accounted for the effects of&#13;
these subsidies and it has not been found possible to obtain data on these&#13;
implicit subsidies.&#13;
14.       The procedure for handling fertilizer costs is therefore to divide&#13;
farm costs between CIF, tax, and domestic marketing components. The accounting&#13;
price is obtained by eliminating the tax component which is comprised of a&#13;
business and municipal tax. The taxes are calculated on a base comprised of&#13;
the CIF price plus 11.5%, an assumed standard profit rate. The business tax&#13;
is 1.5% while the municipal tax is 10% of the business tax. The combined tax&#13;
is 1.84% of the CIF price.&#13;

price changes to 1968 estimates provided by Webber Smith/Lyon&#13;
Associates Thailand Transportation Co-Ordination Study, 1968.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

15.       At various points in the analysis, it is useful to deLine the&#13;
relationship between farmgate and CIF prices for fertilizers. SiT,ce the&#13;
greatest nutrient needs in Thai agriculture are for nitrogen and phosphates,&#13;
a structure of farm gate prices for urea (45% N) and rock phosphates (36%&#13;
P2 05) in 1975 are presented in Table 3; where costs of marketing are at&#13;
accounting prices. The 1.84% tax on the CIF value of fertilizer is a 1.45%&#13;
tax on the farmgate price of urea and a 1.12% tax on the farmgate price of&#13;
rock phosphate. A similar analysis leads to farm price and tax rate on the&#13;
farm price of 2,400 i ton and 1.19% tax for Ammonium Sulphate, of 3,000 s/ton&#13;
and 1.39% tax for Ammophos, and 2,286 i/ton and 1.16% for Super Phosphate.&#13;

16.       Other Chemical Inputs:   The same taxes that are applied to fertilizers&#13;
also apply to rodenticides. While a breakdown of marketing costs on rodenticides&#13;
is not available, the 1.84% tax on the CIF price will be treated as a 1.4% tax&#13;
on the farmgate price. In addition to the same taxes as applied on fertilizers&#13;
and rodenticides, a 5% import duty is applied on imports of insecticides. This&#13;
leads to a 6.84% tax on the CIF price and, assuming marketing costs are 35% of&#13;
CIF costs, to a 5% tax on the farmgate price. The use of all these inputs are&#13;
so small in Thailand that these price adjustments are of negligible importance.&#13;
(3) Capital Inputs&#13;
17.       The main capital inputs used on Thai farms consist of water buffaloes,&#13;
tractors, ploughs and harrows, water pumps, and hand tools. In farm budgets,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-94-&#13;
most of these costs are included under categories labeled land preparation,&#13;
tractor services, or pumps. We first consider water buffalo (for the most&#13;
a part, a non-traded item) and then the other inputs for which there are both&#13;
significant inputs and, among the smaller and simpler items, considerable&#13;
domestic production.&#13;
18.       Water Buffaloes:  Water buffaloes are used extensively for land prep-&#13;
aration, harvesting, and threshing in most regions of Thailand. They are almost&#13;
always used in pairs, have a working life of about 7 years after age 2-3, and&#13;
can be worked about 4 or 5 hours a day. Maintenance costs are minor since they&#13;
consume rice straw and other material with very low or zero opportunity costs.&#13;
There are no compelling reasons to feel that markets do not operate well for&#13;
drought animals. We will make some assumptions to allow the cost of buffaloes&#13;
to be translated into a cost per rai serviced by a water buffalo. Prices in&#13;
1977 for a good buffalo range from 1600 to 2500 baht. This cost has to be&#13;
amortized in seven years. Using a 12% interest rate this implies an annual&#13;
cost of $ 400 1/ per animal or, since two buffaloes are required for about 40&#13;
rai, of 20 baht a rai. Since the cost of water buffalo are related to the cost&#13;
of production which is largely labor time in caring for the animals (they feed&#13;
off rice stubble), the adjustment has been linked to wage costs which in turn&#13;
are linked to the rice price adjustment. An average adjustment of about 13%&#13;
results from the high weight given wage costs.&#13;
19.       Tractors, Farm Machinery and Implements:  Import and related taxes&#13;
levied on farm equipment in recent years are reported in Table 4. These rates,&#13;
for the I test periods required, show a combined tax rate (after adding a&#13;
Management taK equal to 10% of the Business tax) on the CIF price of 20% for&#13;
tractors and tractor parts, 10% on the accessory inputs, 24% on the farm&#13;
implements, and 20% on pumps.&#13;

20.       The cost breakdown for farm use of tractors can be derived in both&#13;
market and accounting prices using the information on tax rates given in&#13;
Table 5. Assuming 400 and 1000 hours of use per year, for the small tractor&#13;
and large tractor respectively the percentage distortion between market and&#13;
accounting prices can be calculated as 19% for the small tractor and 22% for&#13;
the large tractors. With the lower tariff on tractor accessories (10%),&#13;
total costs of tractor use may be distorted slightly less than these figures&#13;
suggest. Calculations by ILACO (ibid p. 293) for the blade and disc ploughs&#13;
show these components represent less than 12% of the tractor costs so that,&#13;
after adjusting for marketing margins for accessories, the combined distortions&#13;
are 18% and 20%.&#13;

Source: The data is from ILACO (ibid. p. 263-264 and p. 293) with adjustments&#13;
since a 30% tariff was used in the ILACO calculations, which over-&#13;
states the import restrictions in Thailand.&#13;
21.       Having linked the adjustment for buffalo accounting costs to the&#13;
adjustment for rice prices, and defined adjustments for mechanized services&#13;
in the 18% to 20% range, adjustments can be calculated for the various&#13;
land preparation and harvesting activities in particular applications and the&#13;
accounting price of labor is derived and the ratios between labor inputs,&#13;
animal power, and machinery use are estimated.&#13;
(4) Paddy Prices&#13;
22.       The adjustments to be made to domestic paddy prices to obtain&#13;
appropriate accounting prices due to the trade interferences are not obvious&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-96-&#13;
since there are (a) 47 main varieties of rice,l/ (?) widely differing&#13;
and frequently changing premiums, (c) gazetted rice prices on which export&#13;
taxes are collected which are not necessarily in line with export prices,&#13;
(d) periods in which quantitative restrictions are effective, (e) periods when&#13;
Thailand has some limited potential for influencing world prices, (f) contro-&#13;
versies about the competitiveness of the domestic rice marketing, (g) uncer-&#13;
tainties about the appropriate conversion factor from paddy into milled rice&#13;
and about the ratios of different types of milled rice obtained from paddy&#13;
and the extent to which these coefficients can vary, and h) doubts about the&#13;
degree to which rice prices for grades with very limited or zero exports are&#13;
linked to rice prices for other grades. In the face of these difficulties,&#13;
estimates require some simplifying assumptions. We have calculated the appro-&#13;
priate accounting prices for paddy based on assuming; (a) world prices for rice&#13;
of different grades are exogenously determined and that the trade restrictions&#13;
in Thailand have their impact on domestic rather than world price levels; 2/ (b)&#13;
that the ratio of milled rice fromi paddy is 66%;3/ (c) that the input of milled&#13;
rice from paddy is by weight 65% of 5% rice, 25% of Al super rice, and 10% of&#13;
1/ There are more if the many classifications of the main grades are&#13;
allowed for. For example, white rice 100% (one of the 47 grades)&#13;
is further classified as Class A, B, and C.&#13;
2/ Thailand's rice production is small relative to the world total&#13;
(less than 5%) but Thailand's exports are more than 10% of world&#13;
exports. Furthermore, in periods of rising world prices, the rapid&#13;
increases in export turns in 1967-1968 and in 1973-1974 probably had&#13;
,me impact on world prices. Nevertheless, a model including these&#13;
,ariods (Olarn Chaipravat and Sayan Pariwat, "An Econometric Model of&#13;
World Price Markets", May 15, 1976) indicate a fairly moderate impact.&#13;
3/ This is a conversion rate that was used by NESDB prior to 1968 when&#13;
it was lowered to 64.4% for large mills and 60.3% for small mills.&#13;
Nopmanee Somboonsub (Rice Milling Technology and Some Economic Impli-&#13;
cations, M.A. Thesis, Thamasat University, March 1976, p. 107) estimates a&#13;
67% recovery rate from milling quite good paddy for 5% rice but notes a&#13;
couisiderable variation in the milling ratio and that this ratio "is one&#13;
of the most carefully guarded secrets of each mill, due both to competition&#13;
and to tax problems." Tipaporn Lokhaphadana (Economic Comparison of Broad-&#13;
casting and Transplanting Dry Season Rice in Thailand, M.A. Thesis&#13;
Thamasat University, 1976, p. 105) reports a 66% milling ratio for a mill in&#13;
Changwat Chachangsao. The question also became important when the Kuhrit&#13;
Government was squeezed between a promise to maintain a price for paddy&#13;
suitable for 5% milling of $2,500 and opposition by consumer groups to&#13;
raising the retail price of rice, particularly in the special government&#13;
low price shops. These opposing pressures could only be satisfied if the&#13;
margins between the two prices could be reduced and the profit margin in&#13;
the middle depends to a large extent on the milling ratio. A special&#13;
committee set by the Government estimated a 66.7 milling ratio; the&#13;
Government estimate used was a 65.4 milling ratio; the Federation of&#13;
Labor Unions of Thailand (a consuming group demanding low rice prices)&#13;
estimated a 71.4 milling ratio, while the Ministry of Agriculture and&#13;
Co-operatives estimated a 66.4% ratio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-97-&#13;
C3 rice;l/ (d) that the relevant export premium on rice is obtained by taking&#13;
a weighted average of the taxes on 5%, Al, and C3 rice where the weights are&#13;
given by the assumed milling output proportions;2/ (e) that the f.o.b. price&#13;
is obtained ly weighting the unit values for export tax classified by head A,&#13;
head others, and brokens by these same milling output weights;3/ (f) that the&#13;
export tax rate for rice is obtained by calculating the export tax revenue as&#13;
a percent of the total value of exports; and (g) that the export tax is cal-&#13;
culated by applying the estimated export tax rate to the estimated export price&#13;
from (e) 4/.&#13;
23.       An alternative procedure is required if working back from known&#13;
export prices (as when paddy prices are not known or for periods when quanti-&#13;
tative restrictions become effective and the total tax burden underestimates&#13;
the divergence between world and domestic prices).    The procedure used is to&#13;
calculate a weighted f.o.b. price with weights as in (c) if export prices for&#13;
the three grades are known 5/ and to deduct estimates of the accounting costs&#13;
of marketing, transportation, and milling 6/ to get an appropriate mill gate&#13;
accounting price of rice. This may then be converted at the milling ratio to&#13;
get an accounting price of paddy. A further adjustment for accounting costs&#13;
of transporting paddy from the fields to the mill gives the desired estimate&#13;
of the farm gate price.&#13;
(5) Water Costs&#13;
24.       The cost of water lhas been estimated by the Mekong Committee from&#13;
information on proposed irrigation projects. Their procedure is to solve&#13;
the following formula for v, the cost per unit of irrigated water which would&#13;
cover total costs of water provision:&#13;
1/ Milling for 5% rice is most common procedure in Thailand since it is&#13;
the favored domestic grade. While technical restraints may prevent&#13;
milling for higher grades, all mills can mill for lower grades and these&#13;
ratios cannot be treated as technological constraints.&#13;
2/ Note that this gives a different result than taking premium revenue&#13;
as a percent of total rice exports as the export grade mix differs&#13;
greatly from the output mix with the higher grades playing a small&#13;
role in exports.&#13;
3/ This is a convenient assumption as unit values classified by these grades&#13;
are easily obtained from Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives,&#13;
"Agricultural Statistics of Thailand".&#13;
4/ A procedure adopted since it is difficult to obtain the gazetted prices&#13;
on which export tax revenue is collected.&#13;
5/ A ratio between the weighted price index and the price for a particular&#13;
grade (based on observations for other time period) may be useful in&#13;
calculating the 'export price' for time periods in which all export&#13;
price series are not available.&#13;
6/ Since the milling conversion factors are calculated for rice, it is&#13;
necessary to obtain costs of milling which are net of the accounting&#13;
value of bran and husk.&#13;

existing systems, it is used to allow some account to be taken of irrigation&#13;

here.&#13;
(6) Labor Costs&#13;
The nature of the adjustment to market wages to obtain shadow wages&#13;
necessitated by depressed agricultural prices has been discussed in Section I&#13;
(part A). The 16% required adjustment of market wages to get shadow wages as&#13;
estimated in Section II (part A) is used here for the wet season for all but&#13;
the South. For the dry season, no adjustment was made as the opportunity cost&#13;
of labor is tied less directly to rice production 1/ in this season. In the&#13;
South, rice plays a smaller role in defining the opportunity costs of labor&#13;
and seasonality is less pronounced. An 8% wage distortion was used reflecting&#13;
both these factors and the relative rates of taxation on rice and rubber.&#13;
1/ This implies a pronounced seasonality in accounting wages. Market&#13;
wages would also reflect this seasonality to a greater degree if not&#13;
for the heavy taxation of wet season agricultural activities.&#13;

            Thailand : case study of agricultural input
            and output pricing
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This study of the Thai rural economy
            examines the nature of the major product and factor markets
            along with the most important forms of government
            intervention in these markets. Considerable emphasis is
            placed on labor, for which the extent of underemployment is
            found to be grossly exaggerated by current available
            estimates. This is due in part to inadequate recognition of
            the fact that non-adult males are drawn into the labor force
            only in response to peak season demands and that
            non-agricultural employment is substantial. Market and
            economic returns per unit of land, nominal and effective
            rates of protection and distortion to the rate of return to
            land are estimated for 71 different agricultural activities,
            including 20 different types of rice cultivation. The most
            important effect of government intervention is clearly seen
            as the disincentive given to rice and rubber production, due
            to heavy export taxation. Certain other crops, such as
            sugarcane, appear to have benefitted directly from
            government protection while all other crops have profited
            indirectly from depressed rice prices which reduce the
            supply priceof labor and land.
