&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Foreword&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Good governance in transport is critical to sustain the development of the sector and&#13;
the economic growth in Africa. With an expected growth of six percent per year be-&#13;
tween 2010 and 2040, responding to the rapidly increasing demand for transport in-&#13;
frastructure and mobilizing funds estimated at $18 billion per year will be a huge&#13;
challenge. This challenge can be met by optimizing the sector efficiency and as a result&#13;
minimizing funding requirements in a constrained budgetary environment. Reducing&#13;
cost and time overruns on civil works contracts to stay within contract values, or re-&#13;
ducing overengineering in road design would on average generate savings of 30 per-&#13;
cent of road construction costs. At the same time, addressing policy and institutional&#13;
issues will be required to achieve the objectives and sustain the results of development&#13;
programs in the sector. Indeed, a review of road transport costs by the World Bank&#13;
has concluded that the benefits from road improvements were not transferred to the&#13;
populations when the right policy environment was not in place, such as when road&#13;
cartels exist as a result of a restrictive regulatory framework. Similarly, a recent review&#13;
of the European Development Fund has concluded that the European Commission&#13;
(EC) is partially effective in its support for a sustainable road network in sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa for reasons such as underfunding of road maintenance and overloading of&#13;
trucks, which have resulted in accelerated deterioration of the road network and cost-&#13;
ly rehabilitation earlier than anticipated. The creation of road funds promoted by&#13;
SSATP was one step towards a more efficient framework for road management. The&#13;
underlying reasons, other than limited funding, that currently hamper the transport&#13;
sector efficiency reflect a poor governance environment which is not conducive to&#13;
improving this efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
The EC has put governance at the top of its agenda. In recent years, the Commission&#13;
has made major efforts to implement this commitment through the development of a&#13;
comprehensive policy framework on governance and the promotion of the concept of&#13;
governance in sector programs. The first dimension of governance is about rules,&#13;
interests, resources and power and how power is used and how institutions function.&#13;
The second dimension is about key principles such as participation, inclusion, trans-&#13;
parency and accountability. The third dimension is that governance encompasses&#13;
several themes that impact on the state's ability to serve its citizens: democratization,&#13;
human rights, rule of law and administration of justice, sole of civil society, public&#13;
administration reform and decentralization. In the transport sector, the 2000 EC&#13;
Communication considered that governance is a prerequisite to sustainable develop-&#13;

ment of the sector and analyzed governance in the transport sector through the lens&#13;
of the three dimensions above. In 2011 the EC launched a study on â&#128;&#156;Assessing Gov-&#13;
ernance in the Transport Sector in Sub-Saharan Africaâ&#128;? in order to assess how to in-&#13;
crease the impact and sustainability of infrastructure development on poverty reduc-&#13;
tion and socioeconomic growth. This effort is now being pursued with the prepara-&#13;
tion of a document to provide guidance and support to stakeholders of the transport&#13;
sector in beneficiary countries to address governance issues when designing or im-&#13;
plementing transport projects and programs.&#13;
&#13;
The present SSATP publication on governance indicators in the transport sector is an&#13;
important contribution to moving the governance agenda forward in that sector. The&#13;
paper identifies a critical subset of indicators that can be used to demonstrate in a&#13;
clear and measurable way, the level and quality of governance in a particular country /&#13;
sector / sub-sector. These indicators provide a tool for countries not only to measure&#13;
governance in the transport sector, but also to monitor results on actions that are&#13;
taken in this area. I trust that countries will progressively adopt these indicators and&#13;
that they will be reflected in the programs supported by development partners to con-&#13;
tribute to render aid more effective.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Executive summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Good governanceâ&#128;&#148;or the absence of itâ&#128;&#148;has concerned policy makers and other&#13;
stakeholders in the transport sector for decades. Most stakeholders recognize that&#13;
effective governance is crucial if improvements in transport infrastructure are to en-&#13;
dure and contribute to sustainable economic growth. In Africa, billions of dollars&#13;
have been spent on improving and rehabilitating transport infrastructure, but it has&#13;
been long recognized that the poor performance of the transport sector is due to far&#13;
more than merely inadequate finance or technical capacity constraints. Governance&#13;
has been indeed the subject of increasing attention and surveys are regularly carried&#13;
out by highly respected organizations, measuring peopleâ&#128;&#153;s perceptions of whether&#13;
â&#128;&#156;things are getting betterâ&#128;?.&#13;
&#13;
The underlying reasons for poor governance are complex, and finding a set of easily&#13;
collectible indicators that can be used not only to track progress but also to advocate&#13;
for policy change has so far proved challenging. To support further efforts, the SSATP&#13;
commissioned this study to identify suitable transport governance indicators. The&#13;
assignment was to carry out a survey and collect data that would identify the main&#13;
transport sector governance issues in four African countriesâ&#128;&#148;Mali, Tanzania, Kenya,&#13;
and Zambiaâ&#128;&#148;and to recommend a methodology for data collection and monitoring&#13;
that could define a set of easily collectible advocacy performance indicators to meas-&#13;
ure transport governance at the national level. The indicators would have to be repli-&#13;
cable in a consistent fashion in several or all countries, thereby producing a compara-&#13;
ble measure of results achieved in the implementation of good governance policies.&#13;
&#13;
Poor governance occurs at many levels of the policy cycleâ&#128;&#148;from the ways in which&#13;
legislation is drafted and regulations, systems, and procedures are worded and applied&#13;
in practice, to how services are eventually delivered to the users of transport and&#13;
whether their expectations are met. The last 10â&#128;&#147;15 years have seen a vast expansion in&#13;
the number of indicators being used to measure performance across many sectors&#13;
(not least transport) and across all phases of the policy cycle. This process is helping&#13;
to introduce transparency and accountability into the routine operations of many&#13;
government ministries, departments, and agencies. The practice has complemented a&#13;
long-term transition from command-type public sector management structures to a&#13;
more commercialized approach to the transport sector (e.g., the introduction of se-&#13;
cond-generation road agencies). This transition has included separation of the func-&#13;

tions of policy formulation, regulation, planning, programming and budgeting, im-&#13;
plementation, and operational activities. These measures all serve to improve the&#13;
quality of public financial management and budget discipline (and, for example, help&#13;
enable general budget support).&#13;
&#13;
Much investment has been made in transport sector performance. And yet, even&#13;
though many highly respected surveys do show improvements in perceptions over&#13;
recent years, significant negative perceptions persist. If improved institutional struc-&#13;
tures, systems, and procedures are really in place, and to some extent are being fol-&#13;
lowed, then what is it that is not happening? And how does this relate to governance?&#13;
And can we shine a light on where things can be done better? Or can we at least high-&#13;
light success stories where they occur, which might then be replicated more widely?&#13;
&#13;
This paper sets out to identify a critical subset of governance indicators in the&#13;
transport sector that can be used to demonstrate in a clear, measurable way the quali-&#13;
ty of governance in a particular country, sector, or subsector. By means of consulta-&#13;
tion with key transport sector stakeholders, it examines transport sector governance&#13;
issues in four pilot countries in order to determine whether there is a consensus on&#13;
what transport sector governance means in practice; why it matters; how it can be&#13;
measured; and in what priority ways improvements in governance might make a real&#13;
difference in the sector and its contribution to national development. At its core, the&#13;
study attempts to reduce the indicator set to what is at the heart of the governance&#13;
matter. For example, a shrinking budget is sometimes cited as the main cause of inef-&#13;
fective delivery, and yet in reality this rarely explains the difference when comparing&#13;
planned and actual spending. Rather, the primary problem is inefficient management&#13;
and the political economy of rent seekingâ&#128;&#148;aspects that can be measured through&#13;
indicators such as cost or time overruns or contract variations.&#13;
&#13;
The technical approach to the study has drawn on the considerable literature that&#13;
explores governance in general and the transport sector in particular. A framework of&#13;
â&#128;&#156;second-generationâ&#128;? indicators was used to guide and shape the investigation. Com-&#13;
plementing earlier work linking governance and development and following the re-&#13;
port by Knack et al. (2002), we selected second-generation indicators as those most&#13;
likely to lead to practical reform because they are generated through a transparent&#13;
process, are available across many countries, and are accurate and specific. Through-&#13;
out the work, the stakeholder perspective was of primary concern. Consequently, this&#13;
perspective shaped both the process and the outputs. This led to a paper that has&#13;
sought to avoid abstract governance definitions, complex composite measures, and&#13;
theoretical solutions, which are often perceived by stakeholders to be significant ob-&#13;

stacles to understanding, ownership, and action. More practically, it has meant that&#13;
the study adopted a broad and shared understanding that governance is best under-&#13;
stood as the â&#128;&#156;exercise of authority with discretion and integrity,â&#128;? while recognizing&#13;
that both â&#128;&#156;supplyâ&#128;? and â&#128;&#156;demandâ&#128;? side governance should be considered to ensure an&#13;
appropriate balance between transport sector delivery and external scrutiny.&#13;
&#13;
This report describes the process followed to select potential indicators from an ex-&#13;
tensive list. The â&#128;&#156;candidateâ&#128;? indicators were matched against a set of dimensions that&#13;
reflected different aspects of governance 1 that many involved in the sector would rec-&#13;
ognize. The indicators were also assessed against a set of criteria that would validate&#13;
them:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Are the indicators actionableâ&#128;&#148;that is, can the primary institution involved â&#128;&#156;do&#13;
          things betterâ&#128;? in response to the findings?&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Are they credible, nationally ownable?&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Are they relevantâ&#128;&#148;do they capture a critical dimension of the quality of gov-&#13;
          ernance?&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Are they sensitive to changes in the underlying phenomena?&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Are they understandable?&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Are they availableâ&#128;&#148;are the data required to measure the indicator available?&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Are they reliableâ&#128;&#148;can the data be trusted?&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Can external agencies use the results to promote progress?&#13;
&#13;
The indicators were then tested against other quality assessment criteria to determine&#13;
whether they could be selected as a mutually reinforcing â&#128;&#156;set.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
Even though a rigorous methodological process was used to develop the indicators, it&#13;
was essential that they be tested in the field against the criteria just listed. The value of&#13;
visiting the four pilot countries lay in being able to match possible indicators against&#13;
the daily, practical, real experiences of those dealing (and living) with aspects ofâ&#128;&#148;or&#13;
the absence ofâ&#128;&#148;governance. The time allotted to the country visits was limited, but&#13;
to the greatest extent possible we met with people from across the public and private&#13;
sectors and from civil society, from the various transport subsectors, and from differ-&#13;
ent governance levelsâ&#128;&#148;from the highest officials to relatively junior employees. Good&#13;
governance is recognizable no matter the perspective.&#13;
&#13;

    These were later refined into a more intuitive transport sector governance cycle.&#13;

&#13;
In summary, this study sought to identify indicators (listed in table 1) that offer the&#13;
potential to credibly measure governance in the transport sector, where this potential&#13;
is understood to be linked not only to the relevance of the indicator to key issues af-&#13;
fecting the sector but also to the capacity of local institutions to embrace the indica-&#13;
tors by monitoring and recording results and acting on findings. The study recognizes&#13;
that the majority of indicators rely on data generated by government bodies (i.e.,&#13;
ministries, departments, and agencies) and less so on perception. But this does not&#13;
necessarily limit the scope for external scrutiny and advocacy. That said, we believe&#13;
that for the indicator set to be sustainable and a sound basis for the initiation (and&#13;
improvement) of engagement between internal and external stakeholders, senior offi-&#13;
cials in the respective ministries responsible for transport across the region should&#13;
take clear ownership of, and commit to, the further development and use of the indi-&#13;
cator sets. They possess much of the data and can exert pressure on the other organi-&#13;
zations responsible for generating other elements. Where an outside or ad hoc body is&#13;

responsible, there is sometimes a sustainability issue, although many of these non-&#13;
transport sector institutions (e.g., auditors, the media, and think tanks) have a critical&#13;
role to play. As for perception data, within the context of this study it was hard to&#13;
identify sector, or even specific subsector, indicators for which data sets would be&#13;
robust enough to pass the stringent selection criteria applied. It was thus concluded&#13;
that others may be better placed to continue to conduct the large-scale surveys need-&#13;
ed to provide the necessary statistical integrity. The process adopted and the tentative&#13;
findings produced suggest some interesting first conclusions and some options for the&#13;
consolidation of both the approach and the findings as the basis for a wider rollout.&#13;
&#13;
Key findings and conclusions&#13;
&#13;
The following key findings and conclusions emerged from this study.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§ It was initially suggested that a transport governance indicator be proposed for&#13;
      each subsector, but because of the many cross-sectoral issues identified in the&#13;
      master indicator list developed in the early stages of the study, it was deemed&#13;
      more appropriate and practical to use governance dimensions to organize the&#13;
      indicators.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§ Key transport governance issues identified in the study across the four pilot&#13;
      countries included the following: political interference in projects and key gov-&#13;
      erning board appointments; limited or non-existent integrated transport sector&#13;
      policy; identification of new and strengthened institutional and regulatory ar-&#13;
      rangements, together with continued evidence of on-going blurred boundaries,&#13;
      unrealistic budgets, and no objective criteria for prioritization; long-term un-&#13;
      derinvestment and prioritization in maintenance across subsectors; and on-&#13;
      going dominance of roads across the transport sector.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§ Easily understood, precise, and actionable indicators are needed. Such a list&#13;
      would exclude some of the internationally recognized robust indicator sets&#13;
      based on composite scores (or indexes). Such sets are thought to obscure reali-&#13;
      ties through artificial â&#128;&#156;smoothingâ&#128;? and to reduce engagement because of per-&#13;
      ceptions of external ownership.&#13;
    ï&#130;§ There is an expressed and credible desire among stakeholders to own indica-&#13;
      tors, but realization of this desire requires taking institutional considerations&#13;
      seriously. Technical competence needs to be balanced against political credibil-&#13;
      ity when advocating particular policy actions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      xvii&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        ï&#130;§ The development of the indicator set is only the first step. Monitoring will gen-&#13;
          erate findings indicating that the indicator set needs to be acted on in ways that&#13;
          lead to measurable results, which may require (external) advocacy or support.&#13;
&#13;
        ï&#130;§ SSATP should receive support to conduct a pilot test in one or more countries&#13;
          in the study (perhaps in all four) of the method proposed (red-amber-green)&#13;
          to rate the indicators and provide a baseline for a needs assessment and priori-&#13;
          tization of actions in these countries for improving governance in the transport&#13;
          sector. This report offers a starting point.&#13;
        ï&#130;§ Finally, SSATP should receive support to identify and develop more accessible&#13;
          ways to present the proposed indicator set to key stakeholders in each pilot&#13;
          country. For many stakeholders, their interest in and potential ownership of&#13;
          the indicators may be better achieved through short presentations, short sum-&#13;
          mary guides, and specific forums or meetings.&#13;

&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This paper examines transport sector governance issues in four pilot countries by&#13;
means of a process of consultation with key transport sector stakeholders. The con-&#13;
sultation was intended to determine whether there is a consensus on what transport&#13;
sector governance means in practice; why it matters; how it can be measured; and in&#13;
what priority ways improvements in governance might make a real difference to the&#13;
sector and to its contribution to national development.&#13;
&#13;
The technical approach draws on the considerable literature that explores governance&#13;
in general and the transport sector in particular. A framework of second-generation&#13;
indicators 2 was used to guide and shape the investigation. However, throughout the&#13;
study processâ&#128;&#148;from defining governance as a concept, through the evolution of the&#13;
study methodology, to identifying the key issues and associated indicatorsâ&#128;&#148;the&#13;
stakeholder perspective was of primary concern and so shaped both the process and&#13;
the outputs. This resulted in a study that sought to avoid abstract governance defini-&#13;
tions, complex composite measures, 3 and theoretical solutions, because they are per-&#13;
ceived by stakeholders to be significant obstacles to understanding, ownership, and&#13;
action. 4 More practically, the study adopted a broad and shared understanding that&#13;
governance is best understood as the â&#128;&#156;exercise of authority with discretion and integ-&#13;
rityâ&#128;? and that, as a corollary, poor governance is about the â&#128;&#156;abuse of power for inap-&#13;
propriate purposes and often personal gain.â&#128;? 5 This working definition facilitated&#13;
communication and did not limit the scope of inquiry. Moreover, it neither con-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
  Second-generation indicators complement an earlier generation of work that helped identify&#13;
the link between governance and development. Second-generation indicators are selected as&#13;
those most likely to lead to practical reform because they are generated through a transparent&#13;
process available in many countries that is accurate and specific (see Knack et al. 2002).&#13;
3&#13;
  A composite indicator or index is an aggregation of indicators into a single measure, intended&#13;
to simplify a complex reality but often criticized for obscuring or smoothing those realities.&#13;
4&#13;
 A considerable literature covers the intellectual challenge of measuring an inherently abstract&#13;
conceptâ&#128;&#148;see, for example, Thomas (2007).&#13;
5&#13;
  This is in line with definitions of public sector governanceâ&#128;&#148;see, for example, World Bank&#13;
(2007b). It is also consistent with OECDâ&#128;&#153;s DAC Guidelines and Reference Series: Good Practice&#13;
Guidance for Development Cooperation, which uses a similar definition for public sector gov-&#13;
ernance (OECD 2006). Also see World Bank (1989) and IMF (2007).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              1&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
strained discussion nor limited the selection of indicators to those that might broadly&#13;
be referred to as â&#128;&#156;supply sideâ&#128;? governance. 6 Indeed, the critical role played by civil&#13;
society in relation to the state was acknowledged by all stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
Ultimately, the approach adopted focused on the search for indicators that stakehold-&#13;
ers agree offer the best (albeit not perfect) opportunity to gather evidence of the ex-&#13;
tent to which authority is being exercised with integrityâ&#128;&#148;or evidence of the results of&#13;
efforts to resist the abuse of power. It also led to a focus on how stakeholders believe&#13;
such indicators could (not should) be measured and on their suggestions for ways in&#13;
which targets might be set and reached through a program of meaningful change.&#13;
Inevitably, because of the range of subsector stakeholders interviewed, some of the&#13;
indicators and intervention options identified are not equally relevant to all transport&#13;
subsectors; some, however, apply to the full range. What the proposed indicators have&#13;
in common is that they are widely understood to reveal something critical about gov-&#13;
ernance in the transport sector, as learned from the stakeholders across the countries&#13;
involved in the study. Furthermore, because they are actionable 7 in the view of these&#13;
stakeholders, they appear to offer the potential for impact on transport sector per-&#13;
formance in ways that would have positive consequences for both national develop-&#13;
ment and confidence.&#13;
&#13;
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Chapter 2 explains the evolution of the&#13;
technical approach incorporating stakeholder feedback. Chapter 3 presents indicators&#13;
the most advocated based on the â&#128;&#156;governance cycle framework.â&#128;? These indicators are&#13;
assessed for quality using the study criteria, and the link between these indicators and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6&#13;
  Many definitions of governance such as this one from the UN Development Programme,&#13;
focus on the role of the state: Governance is the exercise of economic, political, and administra-&#13;
tive authority to manage a countryâ&#128;&#153;s affairs at all levels. Good governance, thus, signifies the&#13;
competent management of resources and affairs in a manner that is open, transparent, honest,&#13;
accountable, equitable and responsive to peopleâ&#128;&#153;s needs and problems. However, governance is&#13;
also about the demands made by citizens, civil society organizations, and other non-state actors&#13;
to hold the state accountable and to make it responsive to their needs. As the experience of&#13;
many countries has shown, the demand side articulation has led to efforts by supply side actors&#13;
to strengthen state organs in order to make them more transparent, accountable, and participa-&#13;
tory. Thus governance is about the supply-demand relationship.&#13;
7&#13;
  Governance and Anti-Corruption Strategy (World Bank 2007a, 34â&#128;&#147;35) defines the need for&#13;
actionable governance indicators that are commonly characterized as â&#128;&#156;narrowly defined and&#13;
disaggregated indicators that focus on relatively specific aspects of governance and could pro-&#13;
vide guidance on the design of reforms and monitoring of inputs.â&#128;? For details, see&#13;

the various transport subsectors is clarified. Options for using existing indicators and&#13;
data sets to substitute for or support these indicators are also considered. Chapter 4&#13;
suggests systems and institutional arrangements for monitoring and evaluation and&#13;
demonstrates the proposed scoring system for each indicator. Options for interven-&#13;
tion at both the institutional and indicator levels are explored. Chapter 5 reaches&#13;
some conclusions and explores options and recommendations for the next steps, in-&#13;
cluding wider rollout. Appendix A and B contain the long and short lists, respectively,&#13;

&#13;
The â&#128;&#156;Inception Report for the Studyâ&#128;? described a revised methodology for the three&#13;
phases of the study: (1) design, (2) country visits, and (3) analysis and reporting.&#13;

First phase&#13;
&#13;
The eight key steps in the first study phase (the design phase) are described here.&#13;
&#13;
Step 1. This step was a review of literature related to the study. 8&#13;
&#13;
Step 2. A long list of over 170 candidate indicators was drawn from the literature re-&#13;
view and organized using a framework of six governance dimensions (see figure 2.1)&#13;
and definitions (table 2.1). The indicator long list appears in appendix A.&#13;

          Step 3. This step consisted of developing clearly defined and justified selection crite-&#13;
          ria. These criteria were then used to score and thereby reduce the indicator long list to&#13;
          a more manageable number and to steer the survey work during the country visits.&#13;
          During a midterm reflection and lesson learning exercise at the end of the second&#13;
          country visit, the criteria were revised slightly (see table 2.2). The shortened list of&#13;
          indicators generated by this process appears in appendix B. This process of indicator&#13;
          selection does not mean that country visits were constrained by a focus on indicators&#13;
          on the list. Rather, the purpose of the list was to offer a starting point for the country&#13;
          visits and to frame conversations that might otherwise range too widely.&#13;

 Revised criteria     Definition&#13;
 Actionable           ï&#130;§   Indicator is narrowly and explicitly defined to provide clarity on the options to be considered&#13;
                          in determining what steps can be taken to improve its score.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Knowing about the score will enable an organization or its key stakeholders to do things bet-&#13;
                          ter or more effectively.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   An institutionalized procedure is either in place or could reasonably be set up to collect data&#13;
                          on the proposed indicator in the future.&#13;
 Credible             ï&#130;§   Indicator does not set direction for progress (and so is neutral) or say when change will be&#13;
                          achieved.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   â&#128;&#156;Leadâ&#128;? indicators located in the arena of formal rules will be avoided if possible.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Indicator is appropriate to the userâ&#128;&#153;s need and unduly affected by exogenous forces.&#13;
 Nationally ownable   ï&#130;§   Indicator resonates with the intended audience and is sensitive to concerns of government.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Data are provided by politically acceptable sources and that can be embraced by reformers.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Indicator is defined in a way that permits meaningful discussion on the appropriateness of any&#13;
                          given rating.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Data can be easily updated by country champions or members of the public with minimum&#13;
                          specialist knowledge.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Indicator is as consistent as possible with those already in use.&#13;
&#13;
 Relevant             ï&#130;§   Indicator captures a critical dimension of the quality of governance.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Indicator reflects important issues that warrant high-level policy advocacy.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Indicator has potential to advance constructive development policy in the transport sector.&#13;
&#13;
 Sensitive            ï&#130;§   Indicator varies sufficiently to allow measurement of changes in the underlying phenomenon.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Unit of measurement is conducive to time-bound targeting.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Interventions can affect this indicator.&#13;
&#13;
 Understandable       ï&#130;§   Indicator is easy to understand by people who are not experts.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Indicator is an unambiguous measurement that is intuitive in the sense that it is obvious what&#13;
                          it is measuring and how it would be interpreted in practice.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Indicator makes the same sense to all; easy to communicate.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Potential userâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to absorb information is respected.&#13;
 Available            ï&#130;§   Data source existsâ&#128;&#148;as primary data (collected by in-country institutions such as the national&#13;
                          statistics office) or as secondary data (other organizations).&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Data collection is frequent or regularized without high cost or risk.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   There is a minimal time lag between the collection and reporting of data to ensure that indica-&#13;
                          tors are reporting current rather than historical information.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Information can be gathered while there is still time to act.&#13;
&#13;
 Reliable             ï&#130;§   Data are trustworthy and defendable.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Data are replicable through a well-documented process.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Measurement process is methodologically sound.&#13;
                      ï&#130;§   Data do not change according to who collects.&#13;

&#13;
            Step 4. The reduced indicator list was scored. The highest scoring indicators were&#13;
            assessed as an â&#128;&#156;indicator set,â&#128;? using basket criteria 9 (these basket criteria were also&#13;
            revised during country visits)â&#128;&#148;see table 2.3.&#13;
&#13;
Table 2.3 Basket of Indicator Quality Assessment Criteria&#13;

Balance between quantita-         ï&#130;§     Basket includes both quantitative and qualitative indicators.&#13;
tive and qualitative              ï&#130;§     Some variables are suitable for rigorous quantitative analysis.&#13;
measures                          ï&#130;§     Some variables are included to allow measurement of subjective judgment&#13;
                                        capturing how key stakeholders perceive the governance environment and&#13;
                                        outcomes in the transport sector.&#13;
Balance among policy, sys-        ï&#130;§     The basket of indicators contains indicators that represent all key stages in the&#13;
tems, and outcome                       policy cycle, from policy formulation through systems to outcome in order to&#13;
                                        balance the mix of lead and lag indicators.&#13;
&#13;
Coverage across Subsectors        ï&#130;§     Basket covers all transport subsectors because a sufficient number of indica-&#13;
                                        tors can be easily adapted to measure the same or similar outcomes in subsec-&#13;
                                        tor domains.&#13;
Equity for Stakeholders           ï&#130;§     Basket will generate data that can be disaggregated to allow measurement of&#13;
                                        progress or impact on different demographic groups, particularly men and&#13;
                                        women, ethnic and tribal, subnational, professional.&#13;
                                  ï&#130;§     Variables will allow measurement of the underlying factors that shape power&#13;
                                        relations and changes in power relations between state and society and be-&#13;
                                        tween different groups in society.&#13;
                                  ï&#130;§     Variables include direct or proxy measures of the empowerment of the poor.&#13;
&#13;
Regional and national appli-      ï&#130;§     A sufficient number of indicators are applicable at the regional level to allow&#13;
cation                                  comparisons between regions.&#13;
                                  ï&#130;§     A sufficient number of indicators are consistent with those used in other Sub-&#13;
                                        Saharan Africa countries so that comparisons can be made between nations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Step 5. Local partners conducted a preliminary assessment of the availability of data&#13;
            to support indicators. An extract of one such assessment (Kenya) is provided in table&#13;
            2.4. The work of refining the assessment of data availability continued throughout the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            9&#13;
              The purpose of the basket criteria was to avoid a situation in which the indicator set became&#13;
            simply a list of indicators that individually satisfied the indicator assessment criteria, but which&#13;
            collectively did not provide a balanced set. The criticism that many indicator assessment crite-&#13;
            ria (such as the mnemonic â&#128;&#156;SMARTâ&#128;?) overly focus on the quality of the individual indicator at&#13;
            the expense of the collective is set out in the Department for International Development&#13;

          Step 6. In this step, meetings were held for the local partners in each country in ad-&#13;
          vance of the arrival of investigators. A generic list of organizations and individuals&#13;

         was circulated to local partners and used as the basis for making preliminary contact&#13;
         with stakeholders and scheduling meetings.&#13;
&#13;
         Step 7. A short perceptions survey (eight questions) was developed to allow data&#13;
         collection to support comparison of the perceptions of the types of stakeholder con-&#13;
         sulted. It was to be used as a tool to frame the discussions, particularly among stake-&#13;
         holders where it might otherwise proceed less easily. The limited coverage possible&#13;
         during such short visits meant that only very tentative inferences could be made from&#13;
         the findings generated. The perception survey questions appear in table 2.5.&#13;

                                                                                                                 Not very much&#13;

      Survey question:&#13;
      To what extent do you agree with the following statements?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 1. The government gets its priorities right with regard to transport sector&#13;
    spending.&#13;
&#13;
 2. The public is adequately informed on how government spends public&#13;
    money on transport provision.&#13;
 3. There are reasonable opportunities for new market entrants to win&#13;
    transport concessions.&#13;
&#13;
 4. Major transport contracts are awarded on a best value for money basis.&#13;
&#13;
 5. It is now rare for a bribe to be paid in order to access or speed up a&#13;
    transport sector service (e.g., driving license or customs clearance).&#13;
&#13;
 6. I believe corruption allegations are generally properly investigated and can&#13;
    be successfully prosecuted.&#13;
&#13;
 7. If public sector officials in a "lead agency" override regulations and proce-&#13;
    dures they will be sanctioned.&#13;
&#13;
 8. Complaints from the public are generally handled fairly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Step 8. Arrangements were made for the one-week visits to each of the four pilot&#13;
         countries.&#13;
&#13;
         Some reflection at the end of the design phase led to the following key observations:&#13;
&#13;
              ï&#130;§     Numerous indicators are already in circulation.&#13;
              ï&#130;§     Identification of those with greatest potential will require adherence to the&#13;
                    quality assessment criteria developed for the studyâ&#128;&#148;but stakeholder views&#13;
                    will be critical.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         10&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             The evolution of a methodology&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Ultimately, the extent to which indicators are understood, can be monitored,&#13;
         and can help match solutions with â&#128;&#156;responsibleâ&#128;? institutions will be strong&#13;
         signals of potential and productive use.&#13;
&#13;
Second phase&#13;
&#13;
The second study phaseâ&#128;&#148;the country visitsâ&#128;&#148;involved visits of one-week duration to&#13;
four pilot countries. Discussions were held with 20â&#128;&#147;30 stakeholders in each country&#13;
to gather perspectives on which aspects of governance are most critical to transport&#13;
sector performance. Stakeholders included those from civil society organizations, the&#13;
private sector, public administration, and political parties. Also during the visits, data&#13;
were gathered on key current governance issues and solutions that work. Inevitably, it&#13;
was not possible to produce a comprehensive report on governance issues across all&#13;
subsectors after such short visits. However, country visit reports incorporating key&#13;
findings from individual country visits and generated through cross-country compar-&#13;
isons were produced.&#13;

&amp;#12;Transport governance indicators in Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Three important process issues emerged during the data collection phase as a result of&#13;
stakeholder feedback, all of which led to changes in the overall methodology:&#13;
&#13;
     1.   The emergence through conversation of the notion of a governance cycle. Alt-&#13;
          hough the governance dimensions and indicator list helped frame the scope&#13;
          of the inquiry at the design stage, during the visits conversations were inevi-&#13;
          tably shaped by stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; sectoral experiences and by their specific role&#13;
          in the management of that particular subsector. This role was often closely&#13;
          linked to a phase in the cycle of management activity (such as the procure-&#13;
          ment phase or the delivery phase). What then emerged quite naturally from&#13;
          the collated stakeholder interviews was a list of governance indicators related&#13;
          to â&#128;&#156;phasesâ&#128;? in the management of the transport sector. Those phases for&#13;
          which indicators were identified appear in the â&#128;&#156;cycleâ&#128;? in figure 2.2, which&#13;
          presents a phasing of activity in which each phase requires the appropriate&#13;
          governance to secure good outcomes. 10&#13;

  Although some of these phases are simultaneous or on-going rather than sequential, they are&#13;
presented for simplicity as separate and distinct phases in figure 2.2.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                             The evolution of a methodology&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Figure 2.3 organizes these phases into a governance framework. The relationship be-&#13;
tween indicators and phases of a governance cycle underscores a healthy perspective&#13;
for at least some stakeholdersâ&#128;&#148;that governance is important at all stages in the trans-&#13;
lation of budget to benefits and the delivery of best value for money in the transport&#13;
sector. The option to select a key indicator for each phase offered the possibility of&#13;
generating an indicator â&#128;&#156;setâ&#128;? in which the whole would be more than the sum of the&#13;
parts. Although each indicator would be an important measure in its own right, there&#13;
would also be interdependence between the indicators, suggesting that progress in&#13;
one might promote progress in others.&#13;
&#13;
    2.   Requests to see the report findings. Most stakeholders expressed an interest in&#13;
         receiving a copy of the list of governance indicators that might be used to&#13;
         demonstrate progress, to set targets for improvement, and to advocate for&#13;
         change. Perhaps these requests were related to some nervousness about the&#13;
         issues that might surface the report , but also appeared to correspond to a&#13;
         real interest in knowing a little more about what governance looks like, how&#13;
         different sectors â&#128;&#156;measure up,â&#128;? and how stakeholders might take ownership&#13;
         of what until now has seemed to be an abstract, academic, or externally gen-&#13;
         erated set of standards. Options for institutional ownership of the indicators&#13;
         identified through this study, the monitoring arrangements that might sup-&#13;
         port them, and the potential for intervention to improve each appear in&#13;
         chapter 4 of this report. Encouragingly, that chapter reports clear opportuni-&#13;
         ties to engage local institutions in governance monitoring in each pilot&#13;
         countryâ&#128;&#148;both with and without further donor support.&#13;
&#13;
    3.   Realization that the perception survey was less important than originally antici-&#13;
         pated. Most meetings held in-country were scheduled for less than one hour.&#13;
         To have framed each conversation around a limited range of questions&#13;
         would have prevented stakeholders from expressing their own views more&#13;
         widely on governance issues and possible responses, which in turn would&#13;
         have limited further refinement of the framework, reduced the opportunity&#13;
         to gather valuable information on stakeholder views about what governance&#13;
         means to them, and reduced the possibility of discovering indicators beyond&#13;
         the initial long list. In any case, because of the limited numbers of stakehold-&#13;
         ers to be interviewed, a focus on the survey would have narrowed the find-&#13;
         ings without offering appropriate robustness to justify the results. Therefore,&#13;
         in most meetings the perception questions were posed only during the last&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        13&#13;

          five minutes of the meeting. In all, 67 stakeholders completed the survey.. 11&#13;
          The results of the perception survey appear in chapter 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The results of the data gathering during country visits and the stakeholder discussions&#13;
were collated and assessed during the third study phase: analysis and reporting. The&#13;
findings, conclusions, and options and recommendations for the next steps are pre-&#13;
sented in chapters 3â&#128;&#147;5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11&#13;
   The survey was not conducted in Mali largely because of the more general â&#128;&#156;reluctanceâ&#128;? to&#13;
discuss governance shortcomings in that country. The study team thus judged that the survey&#13;
might be more provocative than helpful if conducted.&#13;

&amp;#12;Selecting and testing transport governance indicators&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This chapter summarizes the key governance issues raised by stakeholders in the four&#13;
pilot countries and attempts to distil the indicators that have the greatest potential to&#13;
â&#128;&#156;captureâ&#128;? the critical governance component at the heart of the issues debated.&#13;
&#13;
Critical governance indicators: Make or break decision making&#13;
&#13;
In what follows, 10 indicators are proposed, together with a rationale for each to sup-&#13;
port the proposition that the indicator is critical to transport sector governance. This&#13;
rationale is based on stakeholder perspectives that decisions related to these indicators&#13;
are critically important to the successful functioning of the sector because they make&#13;
or break performance targets. The location of each indicator within the governance&#13;
cycle framework (see figure 2.3 in chapter 2) is highlighted. The rationale for the indi-&#13;
cator is followed by a summary of specific issues related to the indicator as deter-&#13;
mined by the study.&#13;
&#13;
In this chapter, a RAG (red-amber-green) scoring system is proposed as the basis for&#13;
establishing baselines and targets for each of these governance indicators and for&#13;
monitoring performance against targets. To demonstrate this process, one of the pilot&#13;
countries or subsectors or ministries, departments, or agencies (MDAs) is assessed&#13;
against each indicator to determine a baseline, suggest a target, and propose some&#13;
options for policy advocacy and practical intervention.&#13;
&#13;
In all cases, actions in response to the indicator may be assigned to an organization&#13;
other than the one proposed as responsible for collecting data to support the indica-&#13;
tor or for the results that the indicator measures. This is particularly true for transpar-&#13;
ency indicators that encourage public access to information, which may then lead to&#13;
advocacy actions by external stakeholders. Thus the supply of information encourages&#13;
a demand for governance. It is also important to emphasize that, although each indi-&#13;
cator offers an important insight into governance in its own rightâ&#128;&#148;because each sits&#13;
within the governance cycle frameworkâ&#128;&#148;the entire set is interlinked. Thus an im-&#13;
provement in one (e.g., clearer priorities) has the potential to leverage improvements&#13;
in another (e.g., alignment of budget).&#13;

           an organizational basis. A clear description of the responsibilities of key MDAs is es-&#13;
           sential for transparency and effective planning and provides clarity for leaders, a focus&#13;
           for delivery, a basis to resist external interference, and a clear locus of accountability.&#13;
&#13;
         What are the outstanding issues? This indicator was presented by stakeholders as a&#13;
         transparency, regularity, and accountability issue. In Kenya, road agencies were&#13;
         viewed as â&#128;&#156;too involved in policy.â&#128;? In Tanzania, senior officials within the Ministry of&#13;
         Transport thought that mandates were â&#128;&#156;competing rather than complementary.â&#128;? The&#13;
         Ministry of Transport in Zambia also thought there were â&#128;&#156;tensions between authori-&#13;
         ties.â&#128;? There was considerable consensus on the value of separating the regulatory&#13;
         function from service delivery, but concern that this should not mean that institu-&#13;
         tions become â&#128;&#156;disjointed and dislocated.â&#128;? There remains concern over duplication of&#13;
         mandateâ&#128;&#148;such as in the road sector in Mali where the lines between responsibility&#13;
         for route types remain blurred and where MDAs are involved in direct procurement&#13;
         in ways that appear to be at odds with their mandated responsibilities. In Kenya, dis-&#13;
         tinctions between the Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Roads are blurred, and&#13;
         reportedly there is interference in the work of the road agencies responsible for the&#13;
         network. In Zambia, the procurement authority is in flux despite a clear shared vision&#13;
         of what needs to change.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Potential for action? Across the pilot countries there is scope for changes in the law to&#13;
tighten mandates, perhaps supported by a corporate planning approach to determine&#13;
what these responsibilities are and where and why the duplications and gaps prevail.&#13;
For one thing, mandate mapping exercises could be undertaken. There is also scope&#13;
for clearer indicators to define institutional performance targets in line with respon-&#13;
sibilities, for sanctions against those who step outside their limits, and for service-&#13;
level agreements that translate these clearer distinctions into functional relationships.&#13;
Compliance with mandate could be included in external audit processes.&#13;

ber of investment decision tools (such as&#13;
HDM in the road sector) and economic analysis approaches would be relevant.&#13;
&#13;
What are the outstanding issues? Across subsectors in Kenya the general view was&#13;
that it is unclear how policy is developed. In Tanzania, policy was seen to be more&#13;
about personal agendas than public priorities. And in Zambia, politicians referred to&#13;
specific projects as examples of government policy. In that country, there was an ex-&#13;
pressed needâ&#128;&#148;by donors and public sector officialsâ&#128;&#148;for an integrated master plan&#13;
and a call for clearer criteria on which to base prioritization decisions and to expose&#13;
political interference, which reportedly were particularly evident in the road project&#13;
selection process. There was a widespread view that roads have dominated the agenda&#13;
at the expense of other subsectorsâ&#128;&#148;particularly the rail networks in Tanzania and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                         17&#13;

&#13;
              What are the outstanding issues? In the pilot countries, expenditure frameworks&#13;
              aligned to policy and sectoral plans are either not fully developed or not binding. In&#13;
              Mali, for example, the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) has limited&#13;
              influence on budget allocations. The Ministry of Transport in Tanzania is constrained&#13;
              by a planning cycle confined to one year. In Kenya, overcommitment of road funds is&#13;
              a major issue, severely curtailing the ability to plan for priorities based on potential&#13;

&#13;
Potential for action? Potential actions include formulating medium-term sector strat-&#13;
egies or expenditure frameworks; developing guidelines; pilot testing fiscal projection&#13;
models and then introducing or improving them to close the gap between projected&#13;
and actual revenue; and exploring new institutional arrangements such as parliamen-&#13;
tary committees to scrutinize and improve budget management.&#13;

&#13;
What are the outstanding issues? Across the pilot countries, the subsectors, and the&#13;
MDAs, there is significant variation in the number and choice of KPIs, the clarity&#13;
with which they are expressed, whether they are measured and reported publicly, and&#13;
the extent to which they are felt to be binding. Some progress has been made in de-&#13;
termining what the highest priorities are in terms of performance measurement, but&#13;
monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) systems remain weak and poorly integrated and&#13;
the data unreliable. There is little commitment by leaders to determining levels of&#13;

               transparency plays a key role in reducing corruption by increasing the risk of corrupt&#13;
               activity being detected. However, transparency only translates into such benefits&#13;
               where the capacity and will to scrutinize and expose wrongdoing have also been de-&#13;

            What are the outstanding issues? Despite significant investment in procurement in-&#13;

the client and the contractor. Indeed, investigators heard numerous stories of ways in&#13;
which procurement regulations were being flouted and side-stepped, 13 to the extent&#13;
that the existence of regulations was deemed to be an inadequate indicator of good&#13;
governance in procurement. However, there was general agreement with one public&#13;
sector stakeholder in Tanzania, who believed that â&#128;&#156;procedures have reduced the&#13;
amount that can be creamed off.â&#128;? Nevertheless, as another Tanzanian public sector&#13;
official stated, â&#128;&#156;Something is still radically wrong somewhere.â&#128;? This view was en-&#13;
dorsed by private sector engineers, who spoke of â&#128;&#156;a conspiracy of silenceâ&#128;? to explain&#13;
the limited number of objections made to contact awards.&#13;
&#13;
Potential for action? Possible actions include establishing a memorandum of under-&#13;
standing with MDAs on the quality, quantity, and timing of the release of infor-&#13;
mation; supporting the use of appropriate means such as websites, journals, national&#13;
or regional newspapers, or public posting; building capacity for external scrutiny of&#13;
procurement plans and awards; including press bodies and not just nongovernmental&#13;
organizations (NGOs); ensuring timeliness of resolution of complaints to allow con-&#13;
tract awards to be reversed if necessary. The Public Finance Management Perfor-&#13;
mance Measurement Framework (initiated by the Public Expenditure and Financial&#13;
Accountability partnership program, or PEFA) has already developed an indicator&#13;
(PI-19) that could be used across the region and provide an overlap with the govern-&#13;
ance framework proposed here.&#13;
&#13;
Indicator 6: Comprehensive time and cost reports on progress of work for major&#13;
             (top 10) transport sector contracts, disclosed to the public in a timely&#13;
             and accessible manner&#13;
&#13;
Rationale: Often neither MDAs nor contractors are under pressureâ&#128;&#148;nor do they&#13;
have a vested incentiveâ&#128;&#148;to prepare periodic progress reports and to establish a com-&#13;
prehensive database that would help track progress and detect early signs of project&#13;
delays and incompleteness. Without such information, there is no capacity to identify&#13;
and analyze the root cause of incompleteness or overruns. A range of â&#128;&#156;evidenceâ&#128;? of&#13;
poor delivery phase governance was cited by stakeholders: pending bills, cost and&#13;
time overruns, and contract variations. Both cost and time overruns are measurable,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13&#13;
   Examples include previewing of tender documents by the preferred contractor,&#13;
thereby allowing the preparation of a proposal and the building of a team before the&#13;
requirement is announced; interference with bid documents; colluding on prices to&#13;
squeeze out legitimate bidders on the grounds of price differentials; fixing the short&#13;
list to create an â&#128;&#156;obvious winnerâ&#128;?; and signing the contract before announcement of&#13;
the award to reduce objections.&#13;

although time overruns were judged to be more accessibleâ&#128;&#148;and less politically sensi-&#13;

countries and subsectors&#13;
because they are attributed in large part to avoidable factors such as poor project de-&#13;
sign, signing of contracts for which there is no immediate budget, delayed cash releas-&#13;
es and payments, contractor competence, and inefficiencies. Time overruns on pro-&#13;
jects are common, with some projects experiencing delays of more than a year. Many&#13;
projects are left on hold without the appropriate acknowledgment that delays cost&#13;
money in terms of penalty payments.&#13;
&#13;
Potential for action? Possible actions are analyzing the bid price against the engineerâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
estimate; putting risk mitigation in place; analyzing patterns of poor performance&#13;
against time and expenditure plans (easier to collect than indicators of quality and&#13;
easier to standardize than unit cost information); undertaking evaluations to deter-&#13;
mine lessons learned; providing enhanced information for audit; and establishing an&#13;
improved basis for accountability (perhaps links to KPIs).&#13;

backlog and the associated high capi-&#13;
tal expenditure that further diminishes the amounts available for maintenance. In the&#13;
road sector, countries with road funds and high fuel levies are substantially more suc-&#13;
cessful at raising finances that translate into high road maintenance&#13;
&#13;
What are the outstanding issues? Across the pilot countries but particularly in Mali,&#13;
the rehabilitation backlog is attributed to poor maintenance spending. In Kenya and&#13;
Tanzania, the high level of pending bills poses a threat to future maintenance. In&#13;
Zambia, upgrading projects appears to be crowding out both the rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance expenditures. This is not a new phenomenon. Political will has long&#13;
diverted resources to building new roads, or upgrading (e.g., paving) existing roads,&#13;
often where there is little economic justification. Funds are diverted from needed&#13;
routine and periodic maintenance, thereby increasing the downstream maintenance&#13;
obligation.&#13;
&#13;
Potential for action? A number of initiatives may be necessary before a consensus can&#13;
be reached on benchmarks for maintenance standards and expenditures on an ap-&#13;
propriate basis. This might include support for establishing or successfully operating&#13;
a road maintenance fund; establishing locally sustainable road management systems;&#13;
gaining political acceptance of the maintenance problem and the benefit that mainte-&#13;

                   progress has been made in Zambia, but civil society representatives suggest that there&#13;
                   is scope for wider consultation with and the enhanced credibility of civil society as a&#13;
                   key player. Nevertheless, there are good examples of positive responses to civil society&#13;
                   scrutiny and suggestion. This view was shared by Zambiaâ&#128;&#153;s Ministry of Transport:&#13;
                   â&#128;&#156;The comprehensive disclosure of information is the primary governance mechanism&#13;
                   which facilitates best outcomes across the transport sector.â&#128;? This position was sup-&#13;
                   ported in Kenya, where the view of one official was that â&#128;&#156;a culture of confidentiality&#13;
                   leads to talk of corruption.â&#128;? Progress in Tanzania rested largely on the disclosure of&#13;

procurement rather than financial plans, but on this it was felt that information was&#13;
presented in a way that obscured meaning. In Kenya, where there has been some at-&#13;
tempt to release budget information to the public, the view was expressed that it has&#13;
not been done in a way likely to be understood by the layman, in part because of the&#13;
terminology used but also because â&#128;&#156;information needs to be linked to more pressing&#13;
issues to excite peopleâ&#128;&#153;s interest.â&#128;? Several stakeholders recommended simplifying the&#13;
language, disaggregating data, and using the appropriate delivery channels. The key&#13;
words used to express views on this were accuracy, timing, and detail.&#13;
&#13;
Potential for action? Possible actions include building capacity for monitoring and&#13;
evaluating units and government officials for their timely and accessible presentation&#13;
of information; using more diverse media channels; building the capacity of civil so-&#13;
ciety to analyze and interpret data; and supporting civil society monitors.&#13;

political appointment of board members&#13;
was a significant issue across all the pilot countries. Stakeholders in all four countries&#13;
expressed the need for independent boards and shared a strong view that board places&#13;
should be advertised and individuals vetted to ensure that they have the skills and&#13;
competencies required to govern. There was considerable frustration that patronage&#13;
dominates the appointment process and shuts out individuals who could make a dif-&#13;
ference. As one Zambian official put it, â&#128;&#156;We donâ&#128;&#153;t have a shortage of people with in-&#13;

                 the sector such as in road traffic and licensing authorities, maritime transport, rail-&#13;
                 ways, and so forth. To better represent the interests of the end users, these boards&#13;
                 should demonstrate independence and their appropriateness for the role.&#13;

                 the Office of the Auditor General. Across the pilot countries, a review to determine&#13;
                 the periodicity, findings, and responses to audits of MDAs would be of value.&#13;

  Quality assessment of the selected indicators using revised criteria&#13;
&#13;
  So that they were consistent with the study methodology, the 10 indicators advocated&#13;
  by stakeholders were rated using the quality assessment criteria to determine whether&#13;
  they were actionable, credible, nationally ownable, relevant, sensitive, understandable,&#13;
  available, and reliable (table 3.2).&#13;

         Scores were high across the indicator set; the strongest indicators were those related&#13;
         to institutional mandate and budget discipline, as well as prioritization, board mem-&#13;
         bership, and disclosure of budgets.&#13;
&#13;
         Against the basket criteria test (table 3.3), the indicator set performed as follows:&#13;

                         able way.&#13;
&#13;
                ï&#130;§        The set is fact-based (see what follows on the importance of perceptions).&#13;
                ï&#130;§        There is a good balance between indicators that focus on policy issues and&#13;
                         those related to systems and outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
                ï&#130;§        All of the indicators have whole sector and all subsector relevance.&#13;
&#13;
                ï&#130;§        There is significant scope for subnational application.&#13;
&#13;
                ï&#130;§        The indicators offer only limited potential for disaggregation by social group&#13;
                         (unless these are geographically located) because of the high-level nature of&#13;
                         the indicators and the generic relevance of the benefits that can be accrued&#13;
                         from transport sector development. The table includes (Y) to indicate that&#13;
                         there is a possibility for some disaggregation, depending on policy priorities.&#13;

            Subsector relevance and indicator potential&#13;
&#13;
            An unplanned but notable potential of the indicator set was highlighted by the basket&#13;
            criteria test and is elaborated in table 3.4. Many of the indicators can be used on a&#13;
            cross-transport sector basis for all of the subsectors (to allow a cross subsector com-&#13;
            parison), for individual subsectors, and for MDAs within the sectors. This flexibility&#13;
            in application would facilitate comparative analysis, assuming the methodology used&#13;
            for assessment could be consistently applied. 3.4 records the potential application of&#13;
            each indicator.&#13;

Composite indicators: Complexity made simple?&#13;
&#13;
It was not the intention of the study to add another 10 indicators to the already over-&#13;
whelming number of indicators in circulation; rather, once the most significant gov-&#13;
ernance issues had been identified, the intention was to select indicators already in&#13;
use that could be used to monitor and manage these issues. The 10 proposed indica-&#13;
tors in large part meet this ambition. They are understood by stakeholders in-country&#13;
and across countries and are already measured in some places and by some institu-&#13;
tionsâ&#128;&#148;albeit not comprehensively, very well, nor necessarily with consequences when&#13;
they reveal poor performance. These challenges are considered in chapter 4.&#13;
&#13;
However, in terms of indicators already in use, the study also considered those that&#13;
have been developed by external players. These often composite indicators or indexes&#13;
offer a number of arguable advantages, including being independently verified, and&#13;
bring together a number of sometimes complex measures, transforming these,&#13;
through a robust methodology, into a single figure. A question for the study was&#13;
whether these composites would provide a better single measure of the priority gov-&#13;
ernance concerns raised by stakeholders. Would they be more reliable and robust&#13;
than any â&#128;&#156;home-grownâ&#128;? variety?&#13;
&#13;
A number of composites were examined in the light of these considerations to deter-&#13;
mine whether these indicators would stand as better proxies for the governance issue&#13;
and the associated indicators identified by the studyâ&#128;&#148;or perhaps offer an appropriate&#13;
data source for institutions keen to monitor performance in this regard. Some of the&#13;
possibilities are listed in table 3.5.&#13;
&#13;
Further consultation would be necessary to assess buy-in from stakeholders to these&#13;
indicators or others. However, overall and somewhat perversely, the strengths of most&#13;
composite indicators perhaps also best describe their weaknesses, because the meth-&#13;
odology that makes them robust is poorly understood by stakeholders and so reduces&#13;
transparency and ownership (something critical for advocacy indicators). The&#13;
â&#128;&#156;smoothing effectâ&#128;? of combining indicators is perceived to obscure realities and com-&#13;
promises credibility.&#13;

           The questionnaire was not used in Mali (although it had been translated) in part because of&#13;
         the difficulties of managing the delicately â&#128;&#156;â&#128;&#152;nuancedâ&#128;? translationâ&#128;&#148;which was extremely im-&#13;
         portant in the other countries as well. Primarily, though, it stemmed from a reluctance to dis-&#13;
         cuss governance issues as openly. The response that there were few governance issues to ad-&#13;
         dress was heard on numerous occasions. Because the questions were to act more as a catalyst&#13;
         for conversation than as a barrier to it, we did not press the matter.&#13;

&amp;#12;A workable approach to measuring and managing&#13;
transport sector governance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of the proposed indicators is to allow policy decision makers to improve&#13;
governance performance within the transport sector and to provide policy advocates&#13;
with access to robust information as a platform for appropriate action. Those meas-&#13;
uring governance often perceive the indicators being examined as broad in nature,&#13;
with perhaps abstract institutional setups, structures, and opportunities for develop-&#13;
ment. To help ground governance as a manageable concept, there needs to be a clear&#13;
and objective basis for the scoring of indicatorsâ&#128;&#148;and one that can better support&#13;
decision making at both the policy and planning levels.&#13;
&#13;
A monitoring and evaluation system: Preliminary design and sample scoring&#13;
&#13;
This chapter begins by presenting a possible scoring framework that would allow in-&#13;
dicators to be base-lined and then targets to be set as the basis for action. The scoring&#13;
system is founded on a simple four-level RAG (redâ&#128;&#147;red/amberâ&#128;&#147;amber/greenâ&#128;&#147;green)&#13;
rating approach, allowing assessment of performance along a continuum. The RAG&#13;
ratings used are presented in table 4.1 and are followed by 10 worked examples to&#13;
exemplify the indicators.&#13;
&#13;
The chapter then examines the institutional arrangements around these indicators&#13;
and provides a preliminary â&#128;&#156;how-toâ&#128;? guide to support the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
of the data to be collected. This examination is followed by consideration of the kinds&#13;
of practical action that might be relevant in countries wishing to move their perfor-&#13;
mance along the indicator â&#128;&#156;score line.â&#128;?&#13;

         Zambiaâ&#128;&#153;s national transport policy was last issued in 2002 (Ministry of Communica-&#13;
         tions and Transport, Republic of Zambia 2002). Many changes were made at that&#13;
         time, including reform of the National Road Fund (from the previous National Road&#13;
         Board) and the Road Development Authority. However, although the transport sec-&#13;
         tor policy exists and identifies issues across some subsectors, it is not linked to the&#13;
         macroeconomic context.&#13;

&#13;
         The ministry responsible for transportâ&#128;&#148;until September 2011 the Ministry of Com-&#13;
         munications and Transportâ&#128;&#148;was very recently merged with the Ministry of Works&#13;
         and Supply. This merger provides an opportunity to rationalize the approach to&#13;
         transport subsector planning. It could include strengthening the capacity of the staff&#13;
         of the Ministry of Transport, Works, Supply, and Communications (MTWS&amp;C) and&#13;
         building the capacity of the Ministry of Finance staff to work in integrated way with&#13;
         transport sector planners and clarify procedures for the preparation of short- to me-&#13;
         dium-term plans and a prioritization process. The national transport policy could&#13;
         also be updated, rationalized, and clearly prioritized, including improving integration&#13;
         of higher-level macroeconomic planning with the current level of Zambiaâ&#128;&#153;s 2010/11â&#128;&#147;&#13;
         2012/13 medium-term expenditure framework. Other actions are to introduce objec-&#13;

&#13;
         According to the auditor generalâ&#128;&#153;s report, there was a significant commitment by the&#13;
         Zambiaâ&#128;&#153;s Road Development Agency between 2006 and 2009. The document reports&#13;
         that in 2008 the RDA committed the government to contracts totaling K 1.643 tril-&#13;
         lion, despite having a total projected budget of K 1.200 trillion (K 685 billion from the&#13;
         Zambian government and K 515 billion from donors). This allocation resulted in an&#13;
         overcommitment of K 443 billion. This overcommitment was also based on the initial&#13;
         unrealistic budget expectations, particularly for donor funding. The total final ex-&#13;
         penditure was K 842.42 billion, or about 50 percent of the RDAâ&#128;&#153;s original commit-&#13;
         ments. In addition, a further five road projects, totaling K 182.455 billion, were pro-&#13;
         cured outside the 2008 work plan. The authority to procure these projects was not&#13;
         available for audit (Auditor Generalâ&#128;&#153;s Office, Republic of Zambia 2009, 7â&#128;&#147;8).&#13;
&#13;
         Potential policy actions in support of the target rating&#13;
&#13;
         Possible policy actions include: reviewing the fiscal projection and resource allocation&#13;
         mechanisms and considering the appropriateness of the procedures of spending&#13;
         agencies and those entities providing funding and control of the mechanisms govern-&#13;

         across the road and port subsectors are routinely reported (e.g., at the Annual Joint&#13;
         Infrastructure Sector Review, JISR, meetings). Some key indicators are in line with&#13;
         the development partnersâ&#128;&#153; performance assessment frameworks for general budget&#13;

        Overall, the reasons for overruns and overspending could be more thoroughly ana-&#13;

        sessments of contractor capacity and track records (without introducing a prequalifi-&#13;
        cation phase), so that the best-qualified contractors are engaged to carry out works.&#13;
        Furthermore, the quality of initial designs could be improvedâ&#128;&#148;to reduce the scope&#13;

        Evidence supporting the current rating&#13;
&#13;
        Using HDM-4 program analysis in April 2011, TANROADS determined the periodic&#13;
        maintenance needs of paved roads over the five years beginning with fiscal 2011/12.&#13;
        The annual financial requirement is some T Sh 88 billion for paved roads. However,&#13;
        T Sh 52 billion was allocated for periodic maintenance of paved roads in fiscal&#13;
        2011/12, or only 59 percent of the amount needed. The financing gap between&#13;
        maintenance needs and maintenance spending overall fell from 65 percent in fiscal&#13;
        2000/01 to 45 percent in fiscal 2010/11 (Ministry of Transport, Republic of Tanzania&#13;
        2011; Ministry of Works, Road Fund Board). Although the coverage of routine&#13;
        maintenance dropped from 82 percent in fiscal 2008/09 to 69 percent in fiscal&#13;
        2010/11 (this is explained by the expansion of the road network managed by&#13;
        TANROADS), periodic maintenance needs remained at a steadier level, about 58 per-&#13;
        cent. In line with this situation, the proportion of roads in good or fair condition has&#13;
        fallen.&#13;
&#13;
        The backlog for paved road maintenance is estimated at T Sh 442billion, and a plan is&#13;
        in place to carry out this work over the five-year period. The Road Fund Board rec-&#13;
        ognizes that it faces a number of issues, the most pressing of which is insufficient&#13;
        funds to meet the huge backlog of maintenance stemming from deferred mainte-&#13;
        nance. Other issues include the inadequate capacity of agencies and some contractors&#13;
        to deliver quality road maintenance and the expanding network as the government&#13;
        increases the upgrading and building of new roads. The strategic plan for 2011â&#128;&#147;14&#13;
        includes increasing funds and raising efficiency through better monitoring of works&#13;
        and curbing overloading as key objectives.&#13;
&#13;
        Potential policy actions in support of the target rating&#13;
&#13;
        The growing backlog of maintenance needs could, in theory, be reduced over time by&#13;
        increased funding. However, if full funding is unlikely, then a manageable system for&#13;
        reprioritization is required, which might involve allocating a greater proportion of&#13;
        road funds to maintenance rather than to upgrading. To facilitate such an approach, a&#13;

        The Civil Society for Poverty Reduction (CSPR), a nongovernmental organization,&#13;
        has introduced a budget tracking and service delivery barometer that bases its assess-&#13;
        ment on government administrative data. Among other supporting points, the&#13;
        CSPRâ&#128;&#153;s 2010 report 21 finds that there is generally a lack of strong structures on the&#13;
        ground to involve citizens or inform them about the available resources, which would&#13;
        then enable them to monitor how these funds are allocated. The use of media such as&#13;
        newspapers to advertise disbursements is perceived to be ineffective because many&#13;
        poor people do not have the money to purchase newspapers and most advertisements&#13;
        are not broadcast on radio. When citizens do receive this information, there is no&#13;
        evidence that those who do receive it even understand it. Furthermore, the govern-&#13;
        ment publishes the Yellow Book for Zambia budget, but many people do not have&#13;

        accounting for local resources. In addition, newspaper reporting could be enhanced.&#13;
        The government could also review Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s policy on the publication of financial&#13;

          Since the indicator was chosen post visit, data to exemplify its use is taken from a whole&#13;
        country report produced in June 2011 for the MinistÃ¨re de lâ&#128;&#153;Economie et des Finances of Mali.&#13;

Evidence supporting the current rating&#13;
&#13;
The 2010 report of the auditor general on the Roads Development Agency recom-&#13;
mended action against 51 findings. By November 2011, 34 (66 percent) of these had&#13;
been implemented.&#13;
&#13;
Potential policy actions in support of the target rating&#13;
&#13;
Findings and associated recommended actions suggested by the Office of the Auditor&#13;
General should be prioritized (high, medium, low importance) to enable a more stra-&#13;
tegic approach to implementation. This approach should also be recommended to&#13;
subordinate auditing bodies. The relevant bodies should receive support to meet five&#13;
further prioritized goals within the next six months.&#13;
&#13;
Availability of data&#13;
&#13;
Indicators are most likely to be used if the data to support them are already being&#13;
collected and used. Although it was not possible in the short time available for this&#13;
study to undertake a comprehensive survey of data availability and reliability, an ini-&#13;
tial attempt was made to summarize availability in the four pilot countries, and the&#13;
summary findings of this exercise appear in appendix C. These findings can be veri-&#13;
fied and improved (see the recommendations in chapter 5).&#13;
&#13;
It is hoped that the prospect of data availability and indicator ownership has been&#13;
maximized by means of the consultative approach adopted by the study team. Under&#13;
this approach, stakeholders have played a significant role in identifying the indicators&#13;
they believe will work in practice.&#13;
&#13;
Institutional arrangements: Balancing internal and external engagement in data&#13;
gathering and advocacy&#13;
&#13;
For any monitoring system to work, a number of key questions need to be answered&#13;
at the institutional level: Who owns the indicators? Where are the data? How reliable&#13;
are they? How are they gathered? Who collects them? What is the frequency of data&#13;
collection? Who checks the data? How do feedback mechanisms work to ensure ac-&#13;
countability? There are potentially up to five institutions that could&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Gather the information (who is the data collector?)&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Analyze the information (who is the data analyzer?)&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Ensure that the data gathering is done (who is the M&amp;E policy advocate?)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Ensure that results are acted upon (who is the performance improvement&#13;
         advocate?)&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Assume accountability for the result (who is responsible for reacting to the&#13;
         results?).&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
          DATA GATHERING&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Like the indicators themselves, the M&amp;E findings need to be fully owned by those in&#13;
the best position to interpret and act on them. For this to be achieved, the M&amp;E sys-&#13;
tem, as well as the indicators, needs to be credible. All of the proposed transport gov-&#13;
ernance indicators must to be institutionally owned, and it must be clear who does&#13;
whatâ&#128;&#148;although sometimes more than one of the five roles just listed may be com-&#13;
bined in one institution such as data gathering and analysis.&#13;
&#13;
For any monitoring system to be sustainable, the data collection should be routine&#13;
and accurate. If it requires particular effort, the enthusiasm for collecting it is likely to&#13;
lapse. Therefore, the decision on which institution will be the primary â&#128;&#156;ownerâ&#128;? of an&#13;
indicator is to some extent guided by the nature of the indicator itself. Note that the&#13;
â&#128;&#156;rightâ&#128;? institutional home will also depend on the level of data being examined. It is&#13;
important that the institution have the competence to do what is required of it in&#13;
terms of M&amp;E.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           49&#13;
&amp;#12;Transport governance indicators in Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In line with these requirements, one of the observed strengths of the indicator set is&#13;
that much of the data required to support itâ&#128;&#148;as described in the examplesâ&#128;&#148;is al-&#13;
ready being collected (e.g., annual subsector budgets, annual programs, annual in-&#13;
come and expenditure reports, and technical and financial audits). There is, however,&#13;
scope for improvement in process and transparency in many cases.&#13;
Table 4.2 lists generic MDAs across the pilot countries and the wider SSATP member&#13;
country context with ownership potential for both data collection and gathering and&#13;
policy (M&amp;E system and performance improvement) advocacy. The last two columns&#13;
show, by way of example, which specific organizations might be the â&#128;&#156;collectingâ&#128;? and&#13;

    ï&#130;§    Identify key performance indicators and indicators of value for money&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Build capacity for data gathering&#13;

    ï&#130;§    Establish and agree on reporting and risk escalation arrangements&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Form and support working discussions.&#13;
Although there will be similarities, institutional arrangements for each indicator will&#13;
not be standardized across countries, and it will be important to map what is most&#13;
appropriate to each case. A mapping exercise covering all 10 indicators in one pilot&#13;
country and establishing frequency and direction of data flow (based on the outline&#13;
methodology described in the next section) could form the basis for wider replication&#13;
and comparison across the SSATP countries.&#13;

Methodology for data collection&#13;
&#13;
To perform their monitoring and evaluation and policy advocacy tasks well, institu-&#13;
tions need clarity on how data should be gathered, baselines established, and targets&#13;
set. Guidance might be needed on (sampling) methodology, periodicity of data col-&#13;
lection, the reporting format, and dissemination channels. Because of the wide scope&#13;
of this study and the time available, coupled with the fact that the final indicator set&#13;
was selected after the visits, there has been only limited time and scope to consider&#13;
methodologies for data collection within specific institutional contexts. However,&#13;
table 4.3 suggests an approach and preliminary set of standards, proposing the follow-&#13;
ing frequency of indicator assessment:&#13;
&#13;
Annual (institutional, strategic, and accountability indicators):&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Mandates&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Priorities&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Budget and expenditure disclosures&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Board membership&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Audit recommendations&#13;
&#13;
Biannual (budget allocation and sustainability indicators):&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Budget allocation&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Benchmarks&#13;
&#13;
Quarterly (program development and delivery indicators):&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§    KPIs&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Procurement&#13;
     ï&#130;§    Progress.&#13;
&#13;
A summary of the quarterly (management) and biannual (operational) indicator re-&#13;
ports could be incorporated within an annual (strategic) governance assessment. This&#13;
tentative proposal would need pilot testing before being formalized (see chapter 5).&#13;

                Interventions to support building M&amp;E capacity&#13;
&#13;
                A good indicator is only as good as the system that is designed to capture its data re-&#13;
                quirements, the quality of the data collected, and the capacity of its institutional own-&#13;
                er to process and use the data collected. Because of the low data quality and statistical&#13;
                capacity 23 of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, further work might be needed on pro-&#13;
                ducing clearer mandates (and funding) for national statistical and monitoring and&#13;
                evaluation institutions. Binding agreements and related action on providing M&amp;E&#13;
                units with data might be needed between MDAs, along with changes in procedures&#13;
                that lead to institutionalization of information requests and receipt and response pro-&#13;
                cesses. Although the methodology suggested for data collection and use is intentional-&#13;
                ly simple, additional capacity building of institutional personnel to improve data&#13;
                analysis may still be needed.&#13;
&#13;
                Intervention options in the governance cycle&#13;
&#13;
                From an institutional perspective, not only is monitoring the indicator important but&#13;
                also acting on the findings. As noted earlier, the owner of the indicator in terms of&#13;
                action may be different from the owner in terms of monitoring. The indicators pro-&#13;
                posed are all actionable, and so should be acted upon. The type of institutional&#13;
                â&#128;&#156;homeâ&#128;? that is appropriate for an action will depend on the action itself, which will in&#13;
                turn depend in part on the nature of the RAG rating. If scores are generally toward&#13;
                the green end of the scale, only minor interventions will be needed (by the accounta-&#13;
                ble agency). If more serious shortcomings are identified, then intervention at a higher&#13;
                institutional level may be needed (by the performance advocacy agency). It is possible&#13;

Table 4.4 Suggested actions to improve indicator rating and country performance&#13;
&#13;
               SUGGESTED POLICY ACTION&#13;
               1. Distinct institutional mandates&#13;
                  I. Create the appropriate legislation, regulations, and procedures (or amend the existing ones).&#13;
                 II. Improve the policy planning capacity of the ministry of transport to oversee the entire sector.&#13;
                III. Develop clear indicators of responsibility to ensure no interference by non-mandated bodies.&#13;
                IV. Introduce corporate planning methodologies to negotiate distinct mandates.&#13;
               2. Integrated planning and prioritization&#13;
                  I. Strengthen the capacity, within MoT in particular, to develop integrated sector plans, which can be&#13;
                     used to guide resource prioritization; develop or improve MoTâ&#128;&#153;s ability to link higher-level macroeco-&#13;
                     nomic planning with a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF).&#13;
                 II. Introduce appropriate integrated transport sector coordination and prioritization; adopt a rational ap-&#13;
                     proach to resource allocation across subsectors, with linked annual programs and budgets.&#13;
&#13;
               3. Budget alignment&#13;
                  I. Seek a binding MTEF that includes linked, objectively verifiable indicators.&#13;
                 II. Introduce a fiscal projection model.&#13;
                III. Improve monitoring capacity.&#13;
               4. Improved KPIs: Design, data collection, and reporting&#13;
                  I.  Strengthen the capacity across relevant ministries and subsector agencies to develop the appropri-&#13;
                      ate sector and subsector performance indicators.&#13;
                 II.  Identify value for money (VFM) indicators and build a consensus around selection.&#13;
 INDICATOR S&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                III.  Institutionalize quality data collection processes across key organizations.&#13;
                IV.   Incorporate data collection processes within financial and management information systems.&#13;
                 V.   Lobby less effective reporting entities to ensure full sector coverage.&#13;
&#13;
               5. Transparent procurement&#13;
                  I.  Split procurement from the implementing authority.&#13;
                 II.  Institute external audit of the processes and key procurement performance milestones.&#13;
                III.  Explore self-assessment by government using Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PE-&#13;
                      FA) standards and methodology; these could be verified by auditors.&#13;
                IV.   Improve access to informationâ&#128;&#148;in the short term, government could use places where people&#13;
                      congregate (e.g., courts and churches) to post information.&#13;
                 V.   Consider having local councils publish information affecting the local area.&#13;
                VI.   Use newspapers to further widen dissemination.&#13;
&#13;
               6. Reduced time and cost overruns&#13;
                  I.  At a higher level, make project financial commitmentsâ&#128;&#148;and contract awardsâ&#128;&#148;only when funds are&#13;
                      actually available and not expected (pending bills).&#13;
                 II.  Tighten assessment of contractor capacity and track record to ensure that only qualified contractors&#13;
                      are invited to tender.&#13;
                III.  Improve the planning, quality, and detail of initial designs.a&#13;
                IV.   Apply better systems and procedures and adopt some key procurement performance indicators.b&#13;
                 V.   Better apply the International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) or a similar approach so&#13;
                      contracts are managed more effectively from start.&#13;
                VI.   As a longer-term intervention, increase the local contracting capacity; by increasing the size of the&#13;
                      pool of qualified contractors, competition can be enhanced and better value for money achieved.c&#13;

&#13;
                7. Appropriate investment in maintenance&#13;
                    I. Agree on a standard for maintenance spending and prioritization and set it as the benchmark.&#13;
                   II. Establish specific benchmarks for routine and periodic maintenance by classification of road.&#13;
                  III. Maintain a database on network length and conditions where possible.&#13;
                 IV.   Support periodic surveys where necessary.&#13;
                   V.  Improve the accuracy of budget predictions and the revenue forecasts that accompany them.&#13;
                 VI.   Provide technical assistance to second-generation road funds to improve budget forecasts of the&#13;
                       level of demand for fuel and likely receipts.&#13;
                 VII.  Exert budget discipline at the line ministry level to ensure that funds are not diverted between cat-&#13;
                       egories (e.g., from maintenance to rehabilitation).&#13;
                VIII.  Make a clear distinction between capital expenditure and maintenance expenditure.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                8. Improved information disclosure&#13;
                   I.  Create a budget act that would allow for meaningful consultation on the budget-making process.d&#13;
                  II.  Encourage government to use gathering places (e.g., courts, churches) to advertise disbursements.e&#13;
                 III.  Speed up progress in implementing the Integrated Financial Management Information System&#13;
                       (IFMIS) as a component of the Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability initia-&#13;
                       tive Encourage local councils to publish their reports accounting for local resources.&#13;
                9. Improved board membership and appointment&#13;
                   I.  Change the legislation governing the institution in question.&#13;
                  II.  Draw up good practice guidelines and adopt a standardized approach in the SSATP countries.&#13;
                10. Transparent and timely implementation of audit recommendations&#13;
                   I.   Regularly review and publish progress reports by the auditor general and the relevant subsector&#13;
                        agencies.&#13;
                  II.   Encourage media and civil society organization involvement and engagement in the process to act&#13;
                        as an outside check.&#13;
a. Thereby reducing the scope for introducing variation orders once project teams have been mobilized and&#13;
where conditions on site do not match those anticipated.&#13;
b. These measures could reduce the time between the preliminary design and the award of design and super-&#13;
vision contracts if excessive time has elapsed.&#13;
c. Steps to be followed could include: (1) building the local agency capacity to manage the procurement pro-&#13;
cess; (2) introducing preferential procurement acts; (3) registering contractors; (4) introducing a training provi-&#13;
sion for small-scale contractors; and (5) instituting equipment hire arrangements&#13;
d. See Afrobarometer on citizen consultation and International Budget Partnershipâ&#128;&#153;s Open Budget Initiative.&#13;

&#13;
that the intervention of a separate, empowered institution or agency (e.g., parliamen-&#13;
tary committee, ministry of finance, ministry of planning and development, or office&#13;
of the auditor general) may be required to provide the independent push that will&#13;
change the way things are done. Some changes may only be effected through the&#13;
drafting and introduction of new legislation. Thus the indicator scores will lead to&#13;
identification of the institutions that should be the focus of (1) intervention support&#13;
and (2) advocacy support. Even though the interventions needed to raise the RAG&#13;
rating of an indicator toward a target will depend both on the level at which the indi-&#13;
cator is applied and the country score/rating, a non-exhaustive list of practical policy&#13;
action options are suggested for each indicator in table 4.4.&#13;

&amp;#12;Conclusions and recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This study has sought to identify indicators that offer the potential to credibly meas-&#13;
ure governance in the transport sector. This potential is understood to be linked not&#13;
only to the relevance of the indicator to key issues affecting the sector but also to the&#13;
capacity of local institutions to embrace the indicators by monitoring and recording&#13;
results and acting on findings.&#13;
&#13;
The study deliberately avoids generating â&#128;&#156;just another setâ&#128;? of governance indicators.&#13;
Rather, it is firmly focused on the issues that emerged from the views of in-country&#13;
stakeholders in order to generate indicators that are clear and measurable and that&#13;
lend themselves to policy action. This focus is apparent throughout the paper, from&#13;
the refinement of the framework around the governance cycle for transport (enabling&#13;
the reduction of 170 plus indicators to a subset that makes sense individually to those&#13;
involved in the cycle and yet operate collectively), through the development of indica-&#13;
tors, RAG ratings, and suggested policy actions that themselves aim to track progress,&#13;
which lies at the core of the governance problem.&#13;
&#13;
The process adopted and the findings produced by the study suggest some interesting&#13;
first conclusions, as well as options for the consolidation of the approach and the&#13;
findings as the basis for wider rollout. The key findings of the study are the following:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§ Presenting governance as a complex, abstract concept at best constrains stake-&#13;
      holder engagement and at worst provides a smoke screen behind which poor&#13;
      governance can be sustained. Thus indicators need to be very precise and prac-&#13;
      tically applicable, and ironically this excludes some of the more robust (inter-&#13;
      nationally recognized) indicator sets that are based on composite scores (or&#13;
      indexes).&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§ Although it was initially suggested that a transport governance indicator be&#13;
      proposed per subsector, because of the many cross-sectoral issues identified in&#13;
      the master indicator list developed in the early stages of the study, it was&#13;
      deemed more appropriate and more practical to use governance dimensions to&#13;
      organize the indicators.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§ There is an expressed and credible desire to own indicators, introduce a moni-&#13;
      toring process, and respond to the results, but for this to be realized, institu-&#13;
      tional considerations have to be taken seriously. In particular, decisions about&#13;
      where to locate â&#128;&#156;ownershipâ&#128;? of the monitoring and data collection processes,&#13;
      as well as the target for policy advocacy, need to be carefully considered. No&#13;
      matter what MDA or other organization is selected, technical competence&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      61&#13;

       policy actions.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§ The collection and sharing of information must be backed by strong policy di-&#13;
       rectives and service delivery agreements in order to facilitate the necessary flow&#13;
       of data to the institutions charged with data compilation. This finding is very&#13;
       country contextâ&#128;&#147;specific because of the ministerial rivalries and political un-&#13;
       dercurrents between MDAs, and so the paper presents possibilities and exam-&#13;
       ples of institutional arrangements rather than proposing a standardized insti-&#13;
       tutional configuration.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§ Indicators that are already understood and in use work best. Because of the&#13;
       poor performance against many of these in the countries visited, there appears&#13;
       little reason to embed governance measures in more composite indicator&#13;
       frames. In any case, composite indicators are perceived to obscure realities&#13;
       through artificial â&#128;&#156;smoothingâ&#128;? and carry the further risk of being seen as the&#13;
       contrivance of external players.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§ However, for even a simple set of indicators (and one that is appropriately&#13;
       monitored) to offer any added value in governance, the indicators would need&#13;
       to be acted on in ways that lead to measurable results. These actions may re-&#13;
       quire external advocacy or supportâ&#128;&#148;for example, to consolidate the introduc-&#13;
       tion of medium-term expenditure frameworks in Mali.&#13;
&#13;
In order to realize the potential benefits of the indicator set, the following next steps&#13;
are recommended:&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§ SSATP should receive the support needed to score one (or more) of the four&#13;
       countries in the study to refine the RAG ratings. Such comprehensive and de-&#13;
       tailed scoring was not possible during the study because indicators could not&#13;
       be finalized until the last visit had been completed.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§ Such a pilot project would also provide an opportunity to produce a first&#13;
       transport sector governance framework (TSGF) report. It would involve set-&#13;
       ting a baseline and prioritizing according to the needs in the country selected&#13;
       to determine which sectors and or MDAs offer the greatest potential for re-&#13;
       form. The pilot project would also help to determine how actionable the indi-&#13;
       cators are and how easy it would be to develop a program of support and self-&#13;
       help to shift the pilot country toward its targets in view of its priority indica-&#13;
       tors.&#13;
&#13;
     ï&#130;§ A scoring and needs assessment methodology could then be formalized for&#13;
       wider use across SSATP countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
62&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Conclusions and recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    The pilot country could be the focus of an institutional mapping exercise to&#13;
         determine whether the monitoring and evaluation, advocacy functions, and&#13;
         institutional arrangements to support the indicators are in place and what, if&#13;
         any, capacity-building support would be required. Consideration could also&#13;
         be given to whether it would be appropriate to identify an overall owner of&#13;
         the transport sector governance framework (and reports).&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Later, SSATP could conduct a robust impact assessment to determine the re-&#13;
         lationship between improvements in the indicator scores in the pilot country&#13;
         and transport sector performance, as well as a cost-benefit analysis to com-&#13;
         pare the costs of consolidating M&amp;E and advocacy functions around the&#13;
         framework with the potential benefits of improved performance. For gov-&#13;
         ernance to become further embedded in the transport sector, further evi-&#13;
         dence may be required to show the link (or otherwise) between the subset of&#13;
         indicators and tangible improvements in delivery across the transport sector.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;§    Throughout the process, focused briefing papers and requests for feedback&#13;
         on the transport sector governance framework could be produced regularly&#13;
         for SSATP representatives to maximize engagement and ownership.&#13;
&#13;
Initially, SSTAP could receive support to identify and develop more accessible ways to&#13;
present the proposed indicator set to key stakeholders in each pilot country (e.g.,&#13;
TSGF charts, graphics). For many stakeholders, their interest and potential ownership&#13;
of these indicators may be best achieved not just by sharing this paper but also by&#13;
using it as a basis for more accessible presentations, short summary guides, and spe-&#13;
cific forums or meetings.&#13;

The national transport policy was last issued in 2002. Many changes were made at that time,&#13;
including the reform of the National Road Fund (from the previous National Road Board),&#13;
and the Road Development Authority. However, currently there is a lack of an overall&#13;
transport master plan, which has meant there is no overall strategic framework for prioriti-&#13;
zation. Reports of political interference in project selection continue to create perceived&#13;
gaps between policy, priority, and expenditure.&#13;
The ministry responsible for transportâ&#128;&#148;until September 2011 the Ministry of Communica-&#13;
tions and Transportâ&#128;&#148;was recently combined with the Ministry of Works and Supply. This&#13;
provides an opportunity to rationalize the approach to trans-sector planning. At present,&#13;
however, the transport sector policy exists and identifies issues across some subsectors, but&#13;
it is not linked to the macroeconomic context. The RAG rating therefore is red/amber.&#13;

&#13;
According to the auditor generalâ&#128;&#153;s report, 24 there was a significant commitment by the RDA&#13;
between 2006 and 2009. The document reports that in 2008 the RDA committed the gov-&#13;
ernment to contracts totaling K1.643 trillion, despite having a total projected budget of K&#13;
1.200 trillion (K 685 billion and K 515 billion from the Zambian government and donors,&#13;
respectively). This resulted in an over commitment of K 443 billion. This over commitment,&#13;
too, was based itself on initial and unrealistic budget expectations, particularly for donor&#13;
fundingâ&#128;&#148;see table belowâ&#128;&#148;with a total final expenditure of K 842.42 billion, or approxi-&#13;
mately 50 percent of the RDAâ&#128;&#153;s original commitments.&#13;

7.   Findings/data:&#13;
&#13;
     Based on data presented at the recent 5th Annual Joint Infrastructure Sector Review,&#13;
     particularly those set out in the â&#128;?5th Joint Infrastructure Sector Review 2011: Policy&#13;
     Analysis Paperâ&#128;? (Ministry of Transport, Republic of Tanzania 2011), it is apparent that&#13;
     performance indicators had been developed and approved across subsectors.&#13;
&#13;
     The JISR report also highlights recent European Union support of a functioning&#13;
     transport sector monitoring system through improved fiber optics and installation of a&#13;
     database. Although the report states that the database is available online at the Minis-&#13;
     try of Transport website, it was not accessible for review for this SSATP study.&#13;
&#13;
     Nevertheless, progress appears evident in this area. Indeed, a recent study supports a&#13;
     move by implementing agencies to set realistic targets for indicators that will be used&#13;
     for assessing subsector performance. This study is currently in draft form, and thus only&#13;
     in later years will evidence of improved indicators targeting emerge.&#13;

&#13;
To achieve this target, the following actions would need to be complete within 12 months:&#13;
&#13;
What                                                                                   Who&#13;
Highlight the most effective examples of reporting as an example to others.            Government&#13;
Lobby less effective reporting entities to ensure full sector coverage.                Media, civil society&#13;
Seek to institutionalize the collection of data in all key organizations.              Across MDAs&#13;
Seek to incorporate data collection processes within financial and management infor-   Across MDAs&#13;
mation systems.&#13;

&#13;
     A report produced in June 2011 for the Ministry of Economy and Finances of Mali&#13;

       the backdrop of the establishment of a Dispute Resolution Committee in March 2010&#13;
       (Decision No. 002/ARMDS-CR). Documents provided for the reporting exercise did not&#13;
       indicate the consequences of complaints. Overall, the rating was red/amber because â&#128;&#156;a&#13;
       mechanism recording and processing claims relating to the process of procurement is&#13;
       in place but its design is poor and it does not work in a manner allowing a timely reso-&#13;
       lution of claims.â&#128;? However, it was noted that the creation in 2008 of the ARMDS (Auto-&#13;
       ritÃ© de RÃ©gulation des MarchÃ©s Publics et des DÃ©lÃ©gations de Service Public) represented a&#13;

dertaken by TANROADS in April 2011. The annual financial requirement is some T Sh&#13;
88 billion for paved roads. When this amount is compared with the allocated amount&#13;
of TSh 52 billion for periodic maintenance of paved roads in FY 2011/12, the needs&#13;
covered only 59 percent. The financing gap between maintenance needs and mainte-&#13;
nance spending overall, however, fell from 65 percent in 2000/01 to 45 percent in&#13;
2010/11 (Ministry of Transport, Republic of Tanzania 2011). Although the coverage of&#13;
routine maintenance dropped from 82 percent in 2008/09 to 69 percent in 2010/11&#13;
(this is explained by the expansion in the road network managed by TANROADS), peri-&#13;
odic maintenance needs held at a steadier level, at about 58 percent. In line with this&#13;
situation, the proportion of roads in good or fair condition has fallen. There are also&#13;
discrepancies between allocated budget and expenditure:&#13;

The backlog for paved road maintenance is estimated at T Sh 442 billion. A plan is in&#13;
place to carry this out over the five-year period. The Roads Fund Board recognizes that&#13;
it faces a number of issues, the most pressing of which is the insufficient funds to meet&#13;
the huge backlog of maintenance because of the amount deferred. Other issues in-&#13;
clude the inadequate capacity of agencies and some contractors to deliver quality road&#13;
maintenance and the expanding network as the government increases the upgrading&#13;
and building of new roads. The strategic plan for 2011â&#128;&#147;14 includes increasing funds&#13;
and raising efficiency through better monitoring of works and curbing overloading as&#13;
key objectives.&#13;

              7. Findings/data:&#13;
&#13;
              CSPR has introduced a budget execution and service delivery barometer that bases its as-&#13;
              sessment on government administrative data. Findings include:&#13;
                  ï&#130;  There is generally a lack of strong structures on the ground to involve citizens or in-&#13;
                    form citizens about the release of funds and the available resources that could ena-&#13;
                    ble them to monitor how these funds are executed.&#13;
                  ï&#130;  The media outlets selected to publicize disbursements such as newspapers are per-&#13;
                    ceived to be ineffective. Many poor people do not have money to purchase news-&#13;
                    papers, and most notifications about disbursements are not broadcast on radio.&#13;
                  ï&#130;  When citizens do receive this information, there is no evidence that they understand&#13;
                    it.&#13;
                  ï&#130;  According to the 2008 Procurement Act and the Budget and Finance Act, the gov-&#13;
                    ernment of Zambia procurement plans and contract award information must be&#13;
                    published in the public media (Daily Mail, Post, and Times of Zambia) in the interest&#13;
                    of fiscal transparency and accountability. However, there has been little conformity&#13;
                    to publicizing plans and contract awards.&#13;
                  ï&#130;  The government publishes the Yellow Book, but many people do not have accessâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
                    nor is the Appropriation Act published.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
   To achieve this target, five of the following actions would need to be complete within six&#13;
   months:&#13;
&#13;
What                                                                          Who&#13;

Address lack of proper handover of assets: RDA to ensure that the items       RDA management&#13;
purchased on contracts are handed over to the RDA by the contractor&#13;
before the retention is released and the completion certificate issued. All&#13;
vehicles and other assets purchased on projects will immediately be reg-&#13;
istered in RDAâ&#128;&#153;s name. The assets received will be added to the agencyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Register of Assets and Books of Accounts.&#13;
Road matrix dissemination strategy: Develop a dissemination strategy          Secretary of Treasury&#13;

   To improve the influence of this indicator on governance in Zambia:&#13;
&#13;
         1.   Prioritize the findings and associated recommended actions of the Office of the&#13;
              Auditor General (high-medium-low importance) to enable a more strategic ap-&#13;
              proach to implementation.&#13;
         2.   Recommend this approach to subordinate auditing bodies.&#13;

            Transport governance indicators in
            Sub-Saharan Africa
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Good governance-or the absence of it-has
            concerned policy makers and other stakeholders in the
            transport sector for decades. Most stakeholders recognize
            that effective governance is crucial if improvements in
            transport infrastructure are to endure and contribute to
            sustainable economic growth. In Africa, billions of dollars
            have been spent on improving and rehabilitating transport
            infrastructure, but it has been long recognized that the
            poor performance of the transport sector is due to far more
            than merely inadequate finance or technical capacity
            constraints. Poor governance occurs at many levels of the
            policy cycle-from the ways in which legislation is drafted
            and regulations, systems, and procedures are worded and
            applied in practice, to how services are eventually
            delivered to the users of transport and whether their
            expectations are met. This paper sets out to identify a
            critical subset of governance indicators in the transport
            sector that can be used to demonstrate in a clear,
            measurable way the quality of governance in a particular
            country, sector, or subsector. By means of consultation with
            key transport sector stakeholders, it examines transport
            sector governance issues in four pilot countries in order to
            determine whether there is a consensus on what transport
            sector governance means in practice; why it matters; how it
            can be measured; and in what priority ways improvements in
            governance might make a real difference in the sector and
            its contribution to national development. At its core, the
            study attempts to reduce the indicator set to what is at the
            heart of the governance matter.
