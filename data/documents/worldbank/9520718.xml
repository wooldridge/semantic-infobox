of descentralizing responsibility for key areas of the service&#13;
delivery to the local areas.This document presents the lessons       The participatory approach of the change process, supported&#13;
learned from the process carried out in Peruvian small towns,        in a "new social agreement for an efficient management of the&#13;
where the local authorities are empowering local institutions        water and sanitation services" as foundation of a Public-Private-&#13;

In Peru there are approximately 650 small towns which are mainly         As it can be observed, the causes of the problems of the water&#13;
capitals of provinces and districts as well as smaller populated         and sanitation services are not of exclusive responsibility of the&#13;
centers. Around 4.1 million Peruvians inhabit in these towns.            municipalities, as they indicate a structural problem of the sector,&#13;
In 150 of these localities the water and sanitation services             and therefore, going beyond the competence of the municipal&#13;
are administered by municipally owned water and sanitation               authorities to resolve it.&#13;
enterprises regulated by a National Regulatory Agency (SUNASS),&#13;
while in the 500 remaining towns, the services delivery is mainly        The high cost of inefficiency&#13;

· Low quality and coverage                                               consequences:&#13;
· Tariffs that do not cover operating costs&#13;
                                                                         · High cost of public health&#13;
· Nil maintenance of the infrastructure&#13;

· Low technical knowledge on water and sanitation system&#13;
                                                                         · Subsidies for those who have more&#13;

· Low willingness to pay of the users&#13;
· Low political will to charge for the services&#13;

As a result, there are low quality and non sustainable water and         another that implies the professionalization of the water and&#13;
sanitation services in small towns.&#13;

&#13;
The causes&#13;
&#13;
The main causes of the described current situation are:&#13;
&#13;
· Political interference in investments and set up of the tariffs to be&#13;
  charged to the users&#13;
· Absence of technical planning of the production systems&#13;
· Expansion of water and sewage networks without technical&#13;
  criteria&#13;
· Lack of resources to hire qualified personnel for operation&#13;
  systems&#13;
· Lack of resources and unawareness of the need of periodic&#13;
  maintenance of the systems&#13;

 local actors: the municipality, the population represented by&#13;
a Community Board of Supervision (CBS) and a Specialized&#13;
Operator (SO). The proposal of redistribution is the following one:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
· The municipality continues being the owner of the infrastructure&#13;
  in representation of the community, but the population and the&#13;
  specialized operator would support it in its task of improving and&#13;
  expanding the systems.&#13;
&#13;
· The municipality continues approving the tariffs -according to its&#13;
  legal attribution- but with the prior consent of the population and&#13;
  also associating it to agreed levels of quality and coverage levels.&#13;
&#13;
· The specialized operator hired by the municipality is responsible&#13;
  for delivering the water and sanitation services.&#13;
&#13;
· The population, by means of a Community Board of Supervision            new management model to have economic, social, and political&#13;
  (CBS), supervises the quality of the services that the users            sustainability. The challenge is usually big due to the social and&#13;
  receive.                                                                institutional context of small towns that is characterized by:&#13;
&#13;
· The municipality, in a participatory way, norms the water and&#13;
                                                                          · Highly and persistent levels of social exclusion&#13;
  sanitation services delivery in the locality, establishing the rights&#13;
  and duties of users and of the specialized operator.                    · An attitude of deep distrust of local authorities and social&#13;
                                                                            leaderships&#13;
&#13;
Under this scheme it is possible to evolve from the Public-Private        · Weak executive capacities of the local government&#13;
&#13;
Partnership (PPP) model to a Public-Private-Social Partnership            · The political instrumentation of the services&#13;
(PPSP), where the social participation in the model would make&#13;
the difference not only in access to information and decision-            Nevertheless, the environment presents opportunities generated&#13;
making but also in the supervision of the service. This fact would        by the transition process from rural to urban of small towns in&#13;
support the new social contract, guaranteeing the sustainability          its search for better standards of living, within the framework&#13;
of the services.                                                          of a diversified and heterogeneousness social and economic&#13;
                                                                          interests, which also generate a democratic demand for civic&#13;
To achieve the implementation of the PPSP a new social                    rights and duties, the formation of public opinion and a space for&#13;
agreement is needed to be built, where municipality and                   civil participation. These are opportunities that will facilitate the&#13;
community accept new rules and roles, as a condition for the              construction of a new local alliance.&#13;

&#13;
The experience of the studies carried out in the framework of the                 In the planning of the change process, it should be considered&#13;
STPP2 showed that in most cases the population had full cost                      when the local legal framework will be established. This framework&#13;

a temporary subsidy to operations from the municipality was                       water and sanitation services delivery in the locality: Though all&#13;
established, in order to make gradual increases in the current tariffs            the ordinances should be promulgated before initiating the SO&#13;
before reaching full cost recovery levels. This was done because in               promotion process, there are some that should be put forth before&#13;
several cases the tariffs had to be increased from 100% to 00%,                   others (i.e. the ordinance of the CBS).&#13;
because the current tariffs were just symbolic and did not reflect&#13;

do not set barriers to the access of the bidders, and that these          generates confusion in the population making the communication&#13;
documents establish objective criteria of qualification and               process difficult, it is advisable to use a generic denomination&#13;

5.5. The promotion process                                             Never the less, the results were interesting, because in the majority&#13;
                                                                       of the cases the SO corresponded to the profile foreseen for the&#13;
&#13;
Upon promoting that the municipalities in the small towns replace      segment from 10.001 to 20.000 inhabitants. The reason was&#13;
&#13;
the model of direct service by a model of delegated services, it is    that they were also interested in smaller scale operations where a&#13;
&#13;
important to take into account the existence or not of an offering     nearby potential small town could exist; and also because the local&#13;
&#13;
of SO in the country, since their non existence implies a need to      entrepreneurs could have enough resources to undertake a bigger&#13;

develop this market.                                                   operation than was originally thought.&#13;

The objective that is pursued with the promotion of SO is to           The prospect for SO&#13;
&#13;
interest the local or regional businessmen, professional and           Having defined an initial profile for the SO, in accordance to the&#13;
technicians to respond to the invitation of the municipality to        new management model design, the next step is to look for&#13;
delegate the water and sanitation services delivery to the SO.         potential bidders that would satisfy this profile. To do so, the&#13;
                                                                       following steps should be taken:&#13;

but the fundamental thing is to bear in mind that for a successful     1º Identify the candidates that could satisfy the profile.&#13;

&#13;
It is important that the SMC understands that there are many diverse       to participate.&#13;
&#13;
interests in the topic, and that each actor has its own agenda:&#13;
· Government: to improve the infrastructure and quality of service     The criteria and exigencies for the selection of the SO&#13;

                                                                           of competence to award the contract would be the percentage of&#13;

smaller tariffs and/or the bigger investment commitment.                 · Sub-contractors of the municipal enterprises.&#13;
In the case of the small towns of the STPP, where the tariffs were       · Water and Sanitation Associations that attend the rural services.&#13;
established previously with scarce historic information, where the&#13;
billing is based on the micro metering, where the potential bidders      Eventually, to be able to generate greater competence, it could be&#13;
do not have the necessary technical capacity to do their own tariff      the SMC who in a transparent way facilitates spaces of encounter&#13;
and price calculation, and where it costs a great communication          between technicians and investors so that they associate and&#13;
effort so that the population accepts the new tariffs, it was            present as bidders.&#13;
considered unpractical to use the tariffs as competence factor.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                         In a process of this type, particularly in the localities of the rank&#13;
Regarding the investments, given the profile of the potential SO,        from 2,000 to 5,000 inhabitants, special care should be given to&#13;
its low financial capacity and its low knowledge on the business         the fact that potential bidders have all the concepts clear and that&#13;
of water and sanitation services, it was considered that the             they understand all the available information that would allow them&#13;
investments that the SO could carry out would have a marginal            to analyze their continuance in time as SO.&#13;
importance regarding the needs of investment, motive by which&#13;
this factor of competence was rejected.                                  The SO selection process&#13;
                                                                         From the call for proposals to the date of reception it is&#13;
The promotion of specialized operators                                   recommended to carry out three meetings with the potential&#13;
&#13;
The promotion of SO                                                      bidders, to provide the pertinent information of the project&#13;
&#13;
Having the profile of the SO that it is looked for and the tender        and its objectives, the information on financial and technical&#13;
&#13;
documents, the SMC should proceed to identify, locate and get            projections of the service and of the potential market, besides&#13;
&#13;
in contact with the potential bidders.                                   personalized advice on the adequate presentation of the required&#13;
                                                                         documentation.&#13;
&#13;
Enforcing the practice of promotion that the STPP recommends             · First meeting: To be carried out in the first three days of the&#13;
in the recruitment of potential SO, this should be done amongst            call for proposals, and has as purpose to interest to the objective&#13;
professionals or technicians that in some way would have been              public to buy the tender documents.&#13;
linked to the provision of water and sanitation services, or linked&#13;
to its supply chain, and to give sufficient time for them to interest    · Second meeting: It should be carried out three days before the&#13;
local entrepreneurs for the needed investments.                            closing time for answering questions in regards to the content of&#13;

In all the groups that presented themselves as bidders in the STPP&#13;
processes, there was always one person that came from:                   · Third meeting: It should be carried out three days before the&#13;
                                                                           proposed presentation date. The purpose of the meeting is to&#13;
· Municipal area of water and sanitation services.                         offer technical assistance to fill in the forms of the proposals&#13;

  size localities.                                                         disqualified because of formal issues.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
6. Capacity building&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
One of the main challenges that the change of the management             For such effect the change of the management model should&#13;
model has is to achieve the sustainability of the services. From         go articulated strategically with a capacity building process in&#13;
the economic, social and institutional point of view, it is the full     a progressive but intensive way for the three actors involved.&#13;
adoption of the actors of their new roles, and the development           Its purpose is not to transmit or fixate new knowledge, skills&#13;
of new skills of technical, entrepreneurial and social                   or techniques, but must go beyond that in order to change&#13;
management. This would allow them to reach superior levels of            attitudes that promote new patterns of conduct, rational and&#13;
performance in the management of the services and implies a              predictable; consequently, incorporating a shared vision of&#13;
substantial rupture with the traditional municipal model.                the development of the services in the locality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                       28&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7. Sustainability of the new model&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7.1. The future challenges                                             7.2. The stability assurances&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Until the quality and coverage of the services is not in adequate      The assurance for the stability of the new management model&#13;
conditions, and it has not passed the test of time (maintaining        during the life span of the contract with the SO has  dimensions&#13;
adequate standard of efficiency and quality), the new management       (social, economic and legal) that should be foreseen in the&#13;
model will be in risk of being reverted by the following local         contract.&#13;
administration. The risks that the new management model could&#13;
face until its stabilization are the following:                        Social assurances&#13;
&#13;
                                                                       In the contract with the SO, a clause should be included that&#13;
· The short time expectations: Generation of high expectations&#13;
                                                                       specifies that any fundamental change in the contract (time&#13;
  that in the short time will not be able to be satisfied, which&#13;
                                                                       limit, reaches, goals, tariffs, etc.), should be submitted to civil&#13;
  generates a climate of tension that weakens the political support&#13;
                                                                       consultation or treated in public audience. Besides the contract&#13;
  to the new management model.&#13;
                                                                       should include the formal intervention of the Community Board of&#13;
· The traditional political influence: Inclusion in the municipal      Supervision (CBS) in the mediation between municipality and SO,&#13;
  electoral agenda of the issue of the new model in an adverse         as a prior step to any process of arbitration or court among the&#13;
  way. This can be done by Mayors with lack of leadership or           parts.&#13;
  weak base organizations support. Mayors with political ideology&#13;
  against private participation or propose that water should not       Economic assurances&#13;
  be charged for. Mayors that do not know the sector laws and&#13;
                                                                       The contract with the SO should include a clause where the&#13;
  sustainability concepts.&#13;
                                                                       unilateral resolution of the contract by the municipality, without&#13;
· Institutional weakness of the local government: Delay in             existing causal for it, should generate in favor of the SO an&#13;
  obtaining resources for the execution of investments due to little&#13;
  transparency in the selection process of the SO that generate&#13;
  doubts on their legitimacy. This can be seen in new Mayors&#13;
  that are not residents of the locality and do not know the social&#13;
  process behind the change of management model, or that come&#13;
  from the rural areas of the municipality.&#13;
&#13;
· Weakness of the specialized operator: Little response capacity&#13;
  of the SO due to a deficient training or inadequate calculation of&#13;
  tariffs that do not keep the economic and financial equilibrium of&#13;
  the service.&#13;
&#13;
All these risks can be prevented from the start with a well&#13;
conducted change process, with the adequate technical distance&#13;
and backed-up with consistent and stable sector policies, fully&#13;
communicated to the new local authorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                     29&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
economic compensation. This clause should prevent new               resolution of a contract with a SO in small towns. Also, in&#13;
municipal authorities from impulsive actions, giving them time      the clause on arbitration, it would be advisable to establish&#13;
to analyze the situation of the services, the background and        a procedure of arbitration seeking the intervention of the the&#13;
its possible implications.                                          Regional Sector Authorities, to be able to include referees with&#13;
                                                                    knowledge of water and sanitation services.&#13;
Legal assurances&#13;
&#13;
The contract with the SO should include a clause that specifies     7.3. The role of the tripartite commission (TC)&#13;
the legal dispositions about the need of having the prior opinion&#13;
of the National Sector Authorities before proceeding with the       In order for the new management model to work, it is not enough&#13;
                                                                    to have the  actors (municipality, SO and CBS) together and&#13;
                                                                    linked by the contract between the municipality and the SO.&#13;
                                                                    They should have a mechanism to dialogue and coordinate that&#13;
                                                                    is institutionalized. This entity should be the Tripartite Commission&#13;
                                                                    (TC), formalized by the municipality, in order for them to deal with&#13;

            Change of water and sanitation services
            management model in small towns with a participatory
            approach : a summary of guidelines
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A management model provides the
            framework in which the roles and responsibilities of all the
            participatory forces that have a stake in the water supply
            and sanitation services sector are defined. In an effort to
            make service providers more accountable to citizens and due
            to the need to empower local institutions, most of the Latin
            American Region is in the process of decentralizing
            responsibility for key areas of the service delivery to the
            local areas. This document presents the lessons learned from
            the process carried out in Peruvian small towns, where the
            local authorities are empowering local institutions so that
            the actors and the roles they assume are more active in the
            decision making process.
