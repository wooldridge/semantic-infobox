               Gentlemen, will you come to order.                I think 'lie have a           (,)UOTUm.   The firstitem&#13;
&#13;
               on the agenda is anT-'roval of He Minutes of the 104th Regular If;eeting of the&#13;
&#13;
               Board.      You have conies of the minutes.                  Are there any comments on theme             If&#13;
&#13;
               not, I declare them aF0roved.&#13;
&#13;
               Item 1:0. 2 or, the agenda is the renort of the Ad F:oc Committee on the addition-&#13;
&#13;
               al Executive Director, that is, the 13th.                         Professor Varvaressos, you are Chair-&#13;
&#13;
               man, or acting actine chairman of that                  co~~ittee1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS:   I was obliged to nropose myself as chairman.                         I think tbat the invitations were&#13;
&#13;
               sent out, and the renlies were received in order and in time and the conclusion&#13;
&#13;
               is   tr~t   we have a thirteenth Executive Director elected.                         We have looked at the&#13;
&#13;
               original cacles so that \"e can say he is duly elected.&#13;
&#13;
               1 Bee    tr~t t~e   Governor for Denmark said "I don't intend to nominate anyone"&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS:   Yes, and he also said that he abstains from voting.                            now in the last naragraph,&#13;
&#13;
               I have proposed rather ca,reful ,,,ording.                   It    "laS   rather difficul t for    me   to be&#13;
&#13;
               Chairman, becs,use the election has been carried out according to views I do not&#13;
&#13;
               accent.      That is why I said that this calculation of votes was done in accord-&#13;
&#13;
               ancE with the deCision of the board.                 That is true.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIBMAIJ:     All right.      :'I"e11 gentlemen, you r.ave seen and heard the renort.                         Do I hear a&#13;
&#13;
               motion for its ap~roval that the recommendations of the committee be adopted?&#13;

&#13;
               The third item is the nroposed election of a fourteeÂ·nth Executive Director.&#13;
&#13;
               The staff has       ~repared   a draft report in order to get the thing off tbe ground,&#13;
&#13;
               and it was cireulated only a very short time ago.                            I don't know bow long you&#13;
&#13;
               have had it, but I know it went out only a little while ago, so that if there&#13;
&#13;
               are any items in it you feel you would like more time to think over, we could&#13;
&#13;
               defer it until the contemplated meeting on the Luxembourg loan later in the&#13;

                There is very little difference,&#13;

McLAIF:         As   t'..   matter of fact, this r,as          bee~   s}';own to Van Camnenhout, and he agrees with&#13;

                it and suggests          t1-'~t   his   01'm   board make the same kind of re-nort.            The differ-&#13;
&#13;
                ence is mainl;; that our resolution is tlrecise as to how                      ~"OU   determine the date&#13;
&#13;
                when the election should be held.                     Their resolution 'bas a preamble. ""tic!! is&#13;

                \"!ish:;-wash:r.       They have got all the same princi1:)al content.                 The difference be-&#13;
&#13;
                tween the hro resolutions is not enough.                     ive have cleared our report with Yan&#13;
&#13;
                Gampenhout, and he r.as no objections.                    lie agrees that if the EYecutivâ&#130;¬ Directorl&#13;
&#13;
                of the :BanY.: will make the report, tJ:ose of the Fund 1.rill :J2J::e theirs similar.&#13;
&#13;
                We talked with Van            Cam~enhout        before we 1:)repared this, and        afte~~ards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
VARVAE-ESSOS:   I think this raises three ouestions.                      I think that was generally understood.&#13;
&#13;
                Vie have discussed this and it ,,,as the general feeling that in vie1-: of the fact&#13;
&#13;
                that Australia has come in and some other countries, it '.&gt;!ill be Just a ouestion&#13;
&#13;
                of justice and the re.mific:ations of Resolution TO of Savl'mnah.                            11e should nro-&#13;
&#13;
                pose something like that.                  The second is, if we '&gt;!ant to start all this talk a.-&#13;
&#13;
                bout the interpretations and problems of Resolution ?:]'o. 10 we should avoid this&#13;
&#13;
                resolution.           However. I think th.A.t in vie':' of the fact t'b..at i t will a7)'1)ly to the&#13;
&#13;
                only countries not represented, the ouestion is to say that they shall }1..ave some&#13;
&#13;
                votes after the 31st December.                    There is no need to start a theoretical discus-&#13;
&#13;
                sion about the bro1ications.                    The third ouestio!l is the nro:oosa1 that '"e shal1&#13;
&#13;
                                                           !-8.&#13;
                come back to seven elective Directors in 19L                        ,,~y   feeli!lg is that i t is a good&#13;
&#13;
                proposal, and the argumentation of the report is convincing.                             I   should be in-&#13;
&#13;
                elined to expect that if there is agreement.&#13;
&#13;
CRAIBlWl:       Is there any other thought about it?                      i'fe can proceed to take action on i t today.&#13;
&#13;
                Do I hear a motion that the report be approved for submission to the Board of&#13;

VAEVAF3SS0S:    When 'tIe discussed this in committee, there . . 'ere tt:ese two names - Ht least                                                wo -&#13;
                and \,:-e 11ere not Quite sure Fhet'1er to give Dreference to Robbins or Robertson.&#13;
&#13;
                But the general idea of the           co~mittee         was that if we preferred one of the two,&#13;
&#13;
                i t should be Robbins, and the feeling of the committee vIas, that if one of the'll&#13;
&#13;
                could not accept, the other would be                   pro~osed,       so   tr~t   if the other members of&#13;
&#13;
                the Board have no objections, we can agree.&#13;

&#13;
                that there is no time to go into a lengthy discussion at present, they wish to&#13;

         of the economy and the possibility- of increasing coal uroduction in Silesia.                                                        I&#13;

         were made available and if only means were set in motion whereby the existing&#13;
&#13;
         equi0ment could be maintained at a relatively efficient state of maintenance. there&#13;
&#13;
         would be a possibility of a substantial increase in coal production.                                              The re(luire-&#13;
&#13;
         ments are the so called bits and pieces.                               Both from a very short range and long&#13;
&#13;
         range uoint of view, their judgment is that a loan might very well be                                             ~roductive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         and that there would be possibilities of a fairly substantial additional shiument&#13;
&#13;
         of coal outside in the \vay of export if SUC!1 financing were forthcoming.                                                    They&#13;
&#13;
         also went into the general industrial position of Poland, and in the general&#13;
&#13;
         industrial field there was the same general conclusion.                                        As to the uolitical&#13;
&#13;
          situation , it is diff1cul\ to comment on that, but i t does affect the economy.&#13;

                  for a groun of this sort to a1JT)raise.        So much for the !'loment as to what their&#13;

                  general irrror-essions   ~"ere.   I \"il1 come back to that again.          As to the general&#13;
&#13;
                  nrobleI:1 of loans to Eastern Bur-one. I think I ought to reTlort ,,'hat the feeling&#13;
&#13;
                  generally was around the United States, which constitutes the area at nresent&#13;
&#13;
                  where '\I'e get most of our lendir:g money fro!:'!.    It    WP.S   made sonewhat clear to&#13;
&#13;
                  me in the course of my recent trins, although there was a consider-able concern&#13;
&#13;
                  as to the implications of the so-called Iron Curtain, when I talked about                      ,~hat&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  the Bank might do in the way of !'laking a loan, and the advantages of loans in&#13;
&#13;
                  that area, and our great r-eluctance in the Bank to accent any 1mnenetrable econÂ·&#13;
&#13;
                  omic barrier in the course of our oper-ations, there was some raising of eye-&#13;
&#13;
                  brows, but the more one talked about the nossibilities I thin.'k the more there&#13;
&#13;
                  was a somewhat hesistant, and somewhat skeptical reaction, but still a certain&#13;
&#13;
                  receptivity to the conce:pt that loans in that area would be successful and de-&#13;
&#13;
                  sirable and nroducti7e and generally helnful in the whole Eur-onean community.&#13;
&#13;
                  r.iind you, I am talking about a cross section of oninion, and not reflecting my&#13;
&#13;
                  own opinions in this thing at all.           It is simply that, since         ~e     are denendent&#13;
&#13;
                  upon the investors, we have to sense their feeling from time to time in order&#13;
&#13;
                  to keep things in nroper balance.         This is conjecture, it is only conjecture.&#13;
&#13;
                  I would have said, as a result of our trips around the country, that a loan, I&#13;
&#13;
                  am not talking about the attitude of any particular member country regarding&#13;
&#13;
                  the loan, I am talking only from the point of view of the investing public whicl&#13;
&#13;
                  we have to reach, that a loan to, I don't say only Poland, bnt any country simi]&#13;
&#13;
                  arly situated, which could be seen by the investors of this country to be help-&#13;

&#13;
                  ticularly a loan which involved stimulation of coal production would have been&#13;
&#13;
                  accepted without any loss, or without putting in jeopardy, the credit standing&#13;
&#13;
                  and position of the Bank.         Thereafter the Paris Conference episode occurred,&#13;

&#13;
              from the renorts that I rsve gotten since the Paris episode and the general&#13;
&#13;
              tenor of things, that it requires perhaps a further succession of events to&#13;
&#13;
              clarify the actual posl tion, and perhaps a further educational campaign before&#13;

              you can say how the Polish Loan would be received by our investors.                                I want&#13;
&#13;
              to be compltely      fraa~    about this position, and I have said about                    W~qt        I am&#13;

&#13;
              we stand in relation to its major points.                       'lie asked them to :out their re!,ort&#13;

              bans a.pply conditions or circumstances which would enable us to be a little&#13;
&#13;
              more sure of ourselves as to the outcome.                       We don't exclude the long range P08-&#13;

              sibilities, but we want to sta.te all phases of it to see just wbkt we think we&#13;
&#13;
              can do.       I have no indications a.s to what the attitude of the member countries&#13;

              \ior1d.     It was therefore necessary to try and describe the dollar problem,&#13;
&#13;
              since the dollar is the shortest currency in the world, or not the shortest&#13;
&#13;
              because there is plenty of it somewhere, but the currency that everyone requires.&#13;

&#13;
          in a general study on the Balance of Payments which you received last Friday.&#13;
&#13;
          Some additional conclusions proposed may be mentioned here.                   They come down to&#13;
&#13;
                                    The dollar problem is not a European, but a world problem.&#13;
&#13;
          All countries have trade deficits with the U.S. except two or three countries,&#13;
&#13;
          of which Cuba is an outstand.ing example.             All countries require dollars as much&#13;
&#13;
          as possible when they export more than they receive                  The figures given in our&#13;
&#13;
          report are the following:            Trade   andmi~ping   deficit of Western Europe towards&#13;
&#13;
          the United States in          1946 was $2.6 billion, and in 1947 at the present rate would&#13;
          be   $4.75 billion.          But the total dollar needs of      We~tern    Europe are nearly       $2&#13;
          billion higher; they were          $5 billion in 1946 and in 1947 they will be over $6&#13;
          billion.             The basic needs, that is, consumption goods, raw material, are by far&#13;
&#13;
          the heaviest burden on external payments for Europe.                 The equipment was only 25%&#13;
&#13;
                                                        391&#13;

           freiGht chzrges in 1946 were             food and feed, $1,100 million; coal $240 million;&#13;
&#13;
           netrolenm $245 million; r8ilways, e~uipment and merchent vessels $250 million;&#13;
&#13;
           machinery and vehicles $300 million, chemicals $120 million and textiles and tobacc!&#13;
&#13;
           $320 million         Reductions due to lack of dollars will most likely occur in the&#13;
&#13;
           textiles and tobacco fields, which are only a fraction of the total.               All the&#13;
&#13;
           items aIDount to over 90% of the 1946 trade deficit of Western Â»~rone to the U S&#13;
&#13;
           Therefore the reasons for the present deficit, except for textiles and&#13;
&#13;
           tobacco, can all be termed basic needs.              The discrepancy between the deficit&#13;
&#13;
           toward.s the U.S. and the dollar needs of ',{estern Europe is accounted for by&#13;
&#13;
           payments of the rest of the dollar area.              Western Europe imports :from CaD9da and&#13;
&#13;
           the Argentine in 1946 were about $1,000 million for food and feed alone.               This is&#13;
&#13;
           exactly equal to the trade and shipping deficit of Western Europe with Argentine anI&#13;
&#13;
           CalWda.         Some progress 112s already been made in the field of self-help - a good&#13;
&#13;
           deal of progress.          Figures concerning production, which has increased, have&#13;
&#13;
           already been given in the Annual Report (textiles, rubber, shipping, etc).&#13;
&#13;
           As   I'l   matter of fact there is a certain stability in the for'oiard trend which had&#13;
&#13;
           be~~       noted earlier     As    to foreign trade, I thillic two figures are quite&#13;
&#13;
           inkresting.         The foreign trade of the Marshall Plan countries to and from Europe&#13;
&#13;
           was in 1946 in va.lue terms ll~ of 1938; and during the last Quarter of 1946&#13;
&#13;
           alone 149,% of nre-war            EVen if you take account of higher prices and if you&#13;
&#13;
           discount them, the rehabilitation of internal and international trade within&#13;
&#13;
           Eurerpe has be. n significant.           If the major part of the basic needs were covered&#13;
&#13;
           by credits or grPJlts, improvement in the credit of the countries concerned would&#13;
&#13;
           of course be considerable.             To the extent that the credit of these countries would&#13;
&#13;
           be improved and to the extent that these countries are borrowers from the&#13;
&#13;
           International :BE1Dk, that should improve the value of the Internation.a.l :B~mk' s&#13;
&#13;
           portfolio.         One point deserves mention at this time.         It really appears that&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                         and in suite of the bad    cro~s   in 1947. it does not seem likely that the&#13;

           volume of grain eXl}orts into Euroye \Â·lill increase durir..g the next season               Other&#13;
&#13;
           elements will tend to decrease in view of the develoument of internal :9roduction,&#13;
&#13;
           such as IIl8nufactured textiles.        Others are of non-recnrrent character. for which&#13;
&#13;
           most of the orders have already been placed and deliveries expected in 1947. such&#13;
&#13;
           as merchant vessels and transportation           e~uiument.     Others, such as c021, will&#13;
&#13;
           only decrease over a period.          A reduction in    ship~ing   expenses expressed in&#13;
&#13;
           dollars !IlE.y be expected in the near future, end in fact freight rates have already&#13;
&#13;
           gone down.        In addition a large fraction of the commodities will be manufactured&#13;
&#13;
           in Eurone.        One of the things which strikes us most is the necessity of keeping&#13;
&#13;
           up the most economic channels of trade ':'hen doing what could be done for the&#13;
&#13;
           rehabilitation of European industry.             Both for trade and      industr~   it seems that&#13;
&#13;
           it is in the interest of        Europee~   production end also that it should have the&#13;
&#13;
           effect of reducing contributicns from abrOAd if the Euronean countries would&#13;
&#13;
           obtain goods from each other rather than from the United States under credit&#13;
&#13;
           arre.ngement s.         It is import&lt;mt that in industry and trade the most economic&#13;
&#13;
           clw.nnels be preserved-          It is in the interest of European       ~roduction    and it&#13;
&#13;
           should limit the assistance from abroad if the European countries should not&#13;
&#13;
           reduce the contribution they make at :present to each other under the excuse that&#13;
&#13;
           the same goods       CP~   be obtained from the United States or other parts of the world&#13;
&#13;
           on credit         The Question in short is whether the        Euro~ean   economies will go baclc&#13;
&#13;
           to Bome kind of war economy and therefore change their trends of producti0n or&#13;
&#13;
           ',-hether they in fact will be able to take part in international trade in a&#13;
&#13;
           manner at least akin to the pre-war manner.            For this reason it seems that the&#13;
&#13;
           necessi ties of austi:rity should not be construed as a motive for abandoning&#13;
&#13;
           traditionally successful crafts, even including luxury gOOds.                  The transfer of&#13;
&#13;
           manpower from crafts to heavy industry would mean a loss of know-how and a&#13;
&#13;
           conaiderableloss of capital.           Furthermore, the loss of craftsmanship would mean&#13;

                          10.   Finally, most important, and which should be the conclusion,&#13;
&#13;
                                what can the Bank and Fund contribution be, assuming that the&#13;
&#13;
                                Marshall Plan comes to life ?               I would say that even before&#13;
&#13;
                                 starting on all these problems, and it cannot be done at&#13;
&#13;
                                random, the real and practical report which will be prepared&#13;
&#13;
                                 in Paris should be at our disposal.             We expect i t as soon as&#13;
&amp;#12;RIST:      possible after the first of       Sept~mber.&#13;
(Contu.)&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Hill, do you ,,;ant to e;ive us a brief       61)J'ilTflary   of your impressions?&#13;
&#13;
HILL       Gentlemen, I wfesn 1 t in Paris as an official observer for the ::Bank, and&#13;
&#13;
           secondly, I left Paris nearly a fortnight aGo, which was before the technical&#13;
&#13;
           c'eporta had   actua~ly   been dra"m u:9, but I die r...eve occe-sion to         mâ&#130;¬~t   some of&#13;
&#13;
           the members of tree Conference and to discuss their problems 1';i th them.                      I can&#13;
&#13;
           Give yOll a little bit of the Paris atmosphere up to about a fortnight ago.&#13;
&#13;
           First of all, the main preoccupation of some of the delegations was how this&#13;
&#13;
           reuort should be    dra~~   up     They were somewhat bewildered and felt they would&#13;
&#13;
           like very much to have some       ~li~ce      from America, which at thBt time hadn't&#13;
&#13;
           been forthcoming, but since then, in a number of meetings "rith the American&#13;
&#13;
           Ambassao.ors in London and Paris, I believe some useful guidance has been&#13;
&#13;
           given.      The original idea was to draft a report divided roughly in                  thr~e&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           sections.      Those sedions would deal with; first, principles and aims; second,&#13;
&#13;
           w1u:.t these countries could do for themselves; and third, what e.ddi tional&#13;
&#13;
           exterru:l assi stance would be required.          It ','!aa felt a.fter some consideration&#13;
&#13;
           that perhaps the best thing to do would be to build up a report which would&#13;
&#13;
           trJ   to satisfy the tests which are likely to be anplied to the report and ita&#13;
&#13;
           findings in America.        That is actually 'Â·Â·h",r'e I ',as consu.ted, and speaking&#13;
&#13;
           purely personally I suggested        tr~t   three tests among others might be applied.&#13;
&#13;
           The first concerns the magnitude in         assist~nce       which might be reGuired, and I&#13;
&#13;
           suggested, I expressed the parely nersonal view, that the magnitude be as&#13;
&#13;
           moderate as possible, and that it should be made                  ~uite   clear in the report&#13;
&#13;
           that it is impossible at this stage to expect a standard of living higher than&#13;
&#13;
           1939 or even as high as 1939.         The second point was that assistance should be&#13;
&#13;
           limited, giving the number of years.           I believe four years to be sufficient.&#13;
&#13;
           It should be on a decreasing scale and under that heading it would be shown in&#13;
&#13;
           the report what the sixteen countries are going to do for themselves.                       The thi:&#13;
&#13;
           point was that it probably would be very useful in order to obtain action in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   396&#13;
&amp;#12;HILL:      this country to show at least in outline somekind of new conception for&#13;
Cantd. }&#13;
           ~1estern      Euro-oe   This might, it is a rather vague term, but such things are&#13;
&#13;
           possible. be a cUstoms union, providing much more division of labour in the sense&#13;
&#13;
           of inuustrial ,roduction, that sort of thing.            The second point is   wr~t   comes&#13;
&#13;
           after initial discussions.            ThEre is a tremendous amount of discussion.       All&#13;
&#13;
           these countrieE are anxious to do something because they feel that this is really&#13;
&#13;
           another chel1ce. e.nd it is a ch&lt;&gt;nce which may not recur. but obviously. there is&#13;
&#13;
           not   ver~'    much time.   Difficulties can arise very soon    ~inly   under three&#13;
&#13;
           headings          The first heading is Germany.      Obvicusly there are conflicts about&#13;
&#13;
           ~he   production in the Ruhr.          Discussions centred around steel production. out&#13;
&#13;
           n.ose discussions .?re bein,.,; taken over to London at the moment.        The second&#13;
&#13;
           proolem was more of a technical problem ano. that was how to integrate Western&#13;
&#13;
           European economy under the headings of production, trade end finance, and various&#13;
&#13;
           teclmicp.l solutions are at the moment, or ,,'ere at that time, being di scuesed.&#13;
&#13;
           No det.c.iled conclusicÂ·ns have be0n reached          There is under the heading of&#13;
&#13;
           integration, the        fund2~ental   problem that is Britain's problem.    Britain,&#13;
&#13;
           economic81ly. hE.s not in the past been part of Europe.           Britain has been a&#13;
&#13;
           trading nation; only some of its trade \.'as with Europe.          When the question of&#13;
&#13;
           the Customs Union came up, it was quite impossible, as was made plain by&#13;
&#13;
           Sir Oliver Franks, it was made quite plain to me, and it would be almost dishonest&#13;
&#13;
           at this stage to se.y yes or no.           It should be looked into and studied very&#13;
&#13;
           carefully.          But I think it is far too e2xly at this stage to expect the Paris&#13;
&#13;
           Conference to say that the Customs Unicn will be concluded in about 5 years' time.&#13;
&#13;
           One of the reasons why the ouesticn of the Customs Union arises was that it was&#13;
&#13;
           felt the.t it ""as a condition of American assistance. but I was informed yesterday&#13;
&#13;
           by Mr. Keenan that i t 'tlas not really so.         Well no\Y', to come to another problem&#13;
&#13;
           which may \nterest you, as it concerns the E8.nk, I was also asked, and since I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       397&#13;
&amp;#12;HILL:         w""s not an or     ~-:.cial   observer I could not give            W official replies, ho'", tf:e Bank&#13;
 (Contd.)&#13;
               ould corne into the picture             All I could say ..:e.s the:::e h(".d bem some discussions&#13;
&#13;
              behEEn the President and Genercl 1'.aTflha                  accordir.g to which the idea     "taB   that&#13;
&#13;
              the A:!neriCPD Gov6rnnent might look aftfr iIlL'!1ediate recuiremfnts for food, and the&#13;
&#13;
              Bank might look after construction and modernisation problems.                         Beyond that,&#13;
&#13;
              I could not say very much, except that I                  menti~ned    that it might be useful for&#13;
&#13;
              them to bear that in mind in dra ...Ting up the report '"i th a list of requirements&#13;
&#13;
              in the sense that a difference might be made between immediate recuiremsnts in&#13;
&#13;
              food    e~d   clothes, and more long-term             re~uirements    in eqUipment.     Secondly, I&#13;
&#13;
              mentioned it may be useful to bear in mind the :&amp;nkls resources or potential&#13;
&#13;
              resc'urces in the next few yecors.               Then I    W8.S   esked whether the Bank might be&#13;
&#13;
              interested in financing hydro-electric power plants,' or any plant which is&#13;
&#13;
              reconstructed to prodUce electricity fro:n bro\&lt;1Il coal.                   I die discover, to my&#13;
&#13;
              "urprise. that actU8.11y cui te a lot of ',ork had been done on thi s specific&#13;
&#13;
              p:'oj ect, and while they may not be si ven in detail in the report. I thin.b:: they&#13;
&#13;
              rk',ve reached a stage where they can give some figures as to capital costs and&#13;
&#13;
              costs of production which .should be interesting.                      By the time I left I had not&#13;
              Sf,en any detailed stRtistics.             In conclusion, I would          SF.Y   that there are very&#13;
&#13;
              sf~rious      problems to be faced, and agreement ha.d not then been reached, I do&#13;
&#13;
              bâ&#130;¬!lieve that this conference, whatever hau:"ens later on, will have been very&#13;
&#13;
              useful indeed, Rnd that, \vhatevE'r happens, whatever financial assistance will&#13;
&#13;
              ~ventU811y       be granted, the Conference, or rather General Marshall's efforts have&#13;
&#13;
              forged together a conferted effort.                   They still feel confident that something&#13;
&#13;
              concrete will come out of it.                  I think that is all.&#13;
&#13;
 CHAJlUX.AN   Th~b::   you very much,        Mr. Hill.        I want to refer to something that         14r. Hill said.&#13;
              I was asked informa.lly "that role the Bank could take in this interval between&#13;
&#13;
              the inauguration of the           pan,   and the present.            I said, and I have already&#13;
&#13;
              reported this, that I did not think the                   ~nk     could possibly step in and take&#13;
&#13;
              c&lt;~~e    of the existing needs nor provide the money involved; that it was not in&#13;
&#13;
              our charter to do so, and I did not think that they should regard the Bank as&#13;
&#13;
              a child thrown to the wolves over the rear of the sled in order to gain some time&#13;
&#13;
                                                         _    ~OR   _&#13;

&#13;
                     the mission of the Bank's officers in Poland first, ano. in the Ruhr during the&#13;
&#13;
                     return trip.            I kno\&gt;,' they have been back a short time, but have you got somethingi&#13;
&#13;
  CHiI.IR1{AN        I may ask Mr. Pineo to report on that, because I had to leave halfway through.&#13;
&#13;
                     Mr. Burlp..nd is not here, is he 7              I think it would be a good idea to get him up.&#13;
&#13;
                     While he is coming uP. they emphasised they were not technically informed to make&#13;
&#13;
                     a study of the Ruhr matter ;o's they had in Poland.                      It would require further men&#13;
&#13;
                     to deal with this end of it before the Bank would be in a position to come&#13;
&#13;
                     forward 1:li th any practical plp..n.           On the other hand. they suggested there was&#13;
&#13;
                     a E:reat deal of '\p!orIc to be done, ?Jld bi ts ?..nd pieces of production falling e.pa.rt.&#13;
&#13;
                     If they could be fine.nced on a short range basis. there v!ould be stimulation of&#13;
&#13;
                     coal production although there were so many difficult problems involved in the&#13;
&#13;
                     Ruhr that were not involved in Polend.                       I think it is fair to say this. though&#13;
&#13;
                     Mr. Burland will confirm it. that their gemral inrpression was that there was&#13;
&#13;
                     room for reconstruction financing.                They talked in terms of possible assistance&#13;
&#13;
                     to deal with this and i t was at that time that I left, so I did not get the&#13;
&#13;
                      thinking of that.             Their trip   t~~ough    the Rtihr, and their conversations there,&#13;
&#13;
                     were so re.pid however. that it was nothing more to them than a general&#13;

&#13;
YAEVABESSOS:   H2,Y I say just one word.                  I think that the question is net quite right l,itl:'_ regard&#13;
&#13;
               to    ~,he   Marshall Plan.              Conditions are so unsettled allover the uorld that I do no&#13;
&#13;
               thbLle it is really serving any useful purpose to discuss the :plan because He should&#13;
&#13;
               be 1)ound to discuss it on1y from a theoretic.al point of viev!.                        I f I may be allm;ed&#13;
&#13;
               to !:lake some comments on the Research report. I should thin-"k: that the Research&#13;
&#13;
               Dep2:rtment, in its study, ought to take into consideration for the future that. its&#13;
&#13;
               reDort is rather too optimistic about requireI:lents.                     I think that \Â·re must be&#13;
&#13;
               prel)ared to face more difficulties than we envisage.                     First of all, I should ILlee&#13;
&#13;
               to draw to the attention of the members of the staff                   tr~t    we cannot really speak&#13;
&#13;
               about any ratio between national income and imports.                      Actually ''Ie have a developme&#13;
&#13;
               of this ratio up till now.                    I have some figures here.        It was   5    to     5.7       up to this&#13;
&#13;
               year and c?.me dOlm to              J.&#13;
CHAIRMAn       I donlt get this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                             - 405 -&#13;
&amp;#12;'ARV}.il.ESSOS:   It is the r:tio      &lt;'   netion.c'll income to imports.           say here that if the retio is kept&#13;
&#13;
                  then the impoJ:'ta of this country will be            ~.8   high as eight or nine billion dollars&#13;
&#13;
                  a year.     In my opinion, this is not possiÂ·ole.               Sometimes the public Gets accustomed&#13;
&#13;
                  to a block in production c.nd the Americ2n ::aublic is very easy to get accustomed to&#13;
&#13;
                  local production.          On the other hand, thpre are some reasons          th~.t   will not come up&#13;
&#13;
                  as quickly as we envisage            First of pll, the time fact is very important.               1&#13;
                                                                                                           it&#13;
                  think the European production G.oes not tell up till now.                  Not only is/not sufficient&#13;
&#13;
                  but because of the inflation, there is a tendency that the                 Eurouea-~   production is&#13;
&#13;
                  absorbed by European countries themselves, which might be a curious statement.                        For&#13;
&#13;
                  exp~ple,   out of 800 million of French exports, only 62.9 were reported shipped to&#13;
&#13;
                  this country        On the other hand, the development of inter-European relations would&#13;
&#13;
                  be very difficult.           If we see the plans, the construction         pLP~s,     for all European&#13;
&#13;
                  countries, "e receive all the d.e.ta, 1:;e see a tendency of increasing production and&#13;
&#13;
                  exports,    ~~d   reducing imports.       If we tAke into consider8.tion that Great Britain&#13;
&#13;
                  and Germany Here the main countries \'lhich absorbed European production, Bnd Germany&#13;
&#13;
                  for a long period \Â·Â·ill not be in        t'.   posHio!). to play any very important role in&#13;
&#13;
                  absorbing European production, then i t is difficult to see the solution                      Similarly,&#13;
&#13;
                  difficultip.s in     G~eat    Britain will diminish imports.           We must come to theconclusion&#13;
&#13;
                  that the anticipated increases of the European production must be absorbed in this&#13;
&#13;
                  country.      Then those difficulties will arise which I mentioned before, so 1 should&#13;
&#13;
                  like the Board to take into account these suggestions.                  1 am afraid we shall come to&#13;
&#13;
                  a result which will be much less optimistic than the one which is represented in this&#13;
&#13;
                  report      This is only a suggestion which 1 present to the Research Department to&#13;
&#13;
                  consider.&#13;
&#13;
  CHlI.IRÂ¥:.Arl   Anything else ?           I want to say that the men who came back from POland are very&#13;
&#13;
                  pleased with the co-operation and assistance they got from the Polish Government.&#13;
&#13;
                  There \yere only one or t,-ro doors locked to them, and in the main, everything \-ras&#13;
&#13;
                  given vdth the greatest fre.nkness.               They assisted the mission in getting around&#13;
&#13;
                  the countrJ' and seeing things in every :possible way.                 The Bank is very grateful&#13;
&#13;
                  for this co-operation.            That is all.&#13;
