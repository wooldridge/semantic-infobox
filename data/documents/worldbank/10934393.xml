The Economic Policy and Poverty Reduction Division of The World Bank Institute conducted&#13;
a core course on Macroeconomic Management: New Methods and Current Policy Issues III&#13;
in Washington, D.C., from December 7-9, 1998. This course was the third of the 6 offerings&#13;
scheduled for the fiscal year 1999 under the Macroeconomic Management series. The first&#13;
two courses were held in July, 1998, in Turkey (Series I) and in October, 1998, in Cote&#13;
d'Ivoire (Series II). Series I and II targeted policy advisors and economists from Government&#13;
Ministries and academic institutions. They focused on participants' capacity-building in&#13;
macroeconomic analytical skills based on extensive training in quantitative methods and&#13;
techniques during a 10-day session. The Washington course, Series III, was a 3-day session&#13;
that was designed primarily for professional macroeconomists at the International Monetary&#13;
Fund and the World Bank. The course reviewed analytical and methodological advances in&#13;
macroeconomics with an emphasis on policy issues. A total of 31 participants attended the&#13;
Washington course, consisting of Bank/IMF staff as well as representatives from academic&#13;
and research institutions.&#13;
&#13;
The WBI Evaluation Unit conducted a Level I (participants' reaction) evaluation using a&#13;
participants' feedback questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of three sections. The first&#13;
section asked the extent to which respondents were satisfied with course content and&#13;
delivery. The second section asked the level of respondents' knowledge about course topics&#13;
before and after the course, based on self-assessment. A 5-point Likert type scale that&#13;
ranged from 1=minimum to 5=maximum was used for each question. The third section was&#13;
respondents' open-ended comments about the course. The questionnaire was completed by&#13;
24 respondents, 77.4% of the total participants. Seven respondents (29.2%) were women. In&#13;
the analysis of course content and delivery, the course was compared with the two previous&#13;
course offering in Turkey (Series I) and Cote d'Ivoire (Series II). Since the Washington course&#13;
was different from the first two Series in terms of targeted audience, course structure and&#13;
length, the analysis was limited to the comparison of selected indicators measuring the&#13;
overall usefulness of the course, relevance of the course to current work, and the quality of&#13;
instructors. Series I was attended by 24 participants and had a response rate of 79.2%,&#13;
whereas Series II had 42 participants and a response rate of 92.9%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Respondent Background in Washington Course&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Twenty-two out of the 24 respondents (91.7%) were Bank/IMF staff and 2 respondents&#13;
        (8.3%) were from academic/research institutions. All respondents except one had&#13;
        either doctors degrees in economics or in other areas (N=15, or 62.5%), or masters&#13;
        degrees in economics or equivalent (N=8, or 33.3%). One person reported having&#13;
        virtually no formal study in economics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     l  Respondents had different years of work experience in the field of economics. Of the&#13;
        20 participants who responded to this question, 10 (50%) had less than 10 years, 6&#13;
        (30%) had 10-19 years, and 4 (20%) had more than 20 years of experience. Nearly&#13;
        half of the respondents indicated that they were interested in keeping themselves&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     half of the respondents indicated that they were interested in keeping themselves&#13;
     updated on the most recent quantitative analysis in economics. Fifteen respondents&#13;
     (62.5%) reported to have followed at least some current research literature closely on&#13;
     quantitative methods, and 11 (45.8%) reported having had a formal training in&#13;
     quantitative techniques within the past five years. Although demographic questions&#13;
     were limited in the two previous course offerings, at least 60% of the respondents in&#13;
     Series I and II also reported having closely followed up on the latest quantitative&#13;
     methods through training and literature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  l  Respondents represented all of the Bank's geographical regions except one region,&#13;
     South Asia. Regions that the respondents identified as the areas of their responsibility&#13;
     at work were Africa (N=9), Europe and Central Asia (N=6), East Asia and Pacific&#13;
     (N=4), Latin America and the Caribbean (N=4), and Middle East and North Africa&#13;
     (N=3). Respondents were allowed to select more than one region on this question.&#13;
     Three respondents indicated their areas of responsibility as "global."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Course Content and Delivery&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  l  The overall usefulness of the course received a mean score of 3.92 out of 5.0. This&#13;
     was one of the highest ratings in this evaluation, with approximately 80% (79.2%)&#13;
     rating either 4 or 5 on this indicator. When asked to describe the most useful aspect&#13;
     of the course, 9 out of the 19 respondents (47.4%) who provided written comments&#13;
     noted that the course brought them up-to-date on the latest literature and research&#13;
     models in the field of macroeconomic policy issues. It was indicated, however, that&#13;
     the rating of the course's overall usefulness was much lower in the Washington&#13;
     course, compared with the two previous course offerings. The past two series of this&#13;
     course had received mean scores of 4.53 in Series I and 4.32 in Series II.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  l  One possible reason for a relatively lower rating in the course's overall usefulness in&#13;
     Washington may have been associated with varying levels of relevance of the course&#13;
     to respondents' work. The indicator measuring the relevance of the course to current&#13;
     function was 3.74 in Washington. While 14 out of the 24 respondents (58%) indicated&#13;
     the strongest relevance to their work by rating either 4 or 5, the remaining 10&#13;
     respondents (42%) selected a rating of 3 or below on this indicator. Four respondents&#13;
     (17%) reported the minimal relevance of the course to their current work by rating&#13;
     either 1 or 2. In the two previous courses, the relevance to current work received 4.63&#13;
     (Series I) and 4.44 (Series II) out of 5.0. All respondents in Series I, and 85% in&#13;
     Series II, rated either 4 or 5 on the course's relevance to work. For respondents in&#13;
     Washington the course was more relevant to their personal learning needs&#13;
     (mean=3.96). It was evident from their comments that respondents in Washington&#13;
     found at least some part of the course related to their work, and beneficial. As one&#13;
     respondent suggested, however, the course organizer is advised to take steps to&#13;
     ensure that prospective candidates know detailed course contents in advance, in&#13;
     order for them to be able to decide whether the course is relevant and appropriate for&#13;
     them to attend.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  l  On the quality of instructors, respondents in the Washington course reported high&#13;
     levels of satisfaction that were similar to those observed in the two previous offerings.&#13;
     More than 90% of respondents in the Washington course rated either 4 or 5 on the&#13;
     question that asked about the instructors' knowledge about the issues, giving the&#13;
     highest mean score in the evaluation, 4.33. This item was 4.32 in Series I, and 4.38 in&#13;
     Series II. The effectiveness of instructors in communicating messages was 4.09 in&#13;
     Washington, 4.26 and 4.08 in Series I and II. The five most common suggestions&#13;
     provided by the respondents concerning the instructors' presentations were: 1) try to&#13;
     avoid focusing only on instructors' own working models in the presentation; 2) allow&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      participants to debate over the materials just presented; 3) cover fewer materials in&#13;
      one presentation with more time; 4) ensure that each session start on time and avoid&#13;
      ending the day after 6 p.m.; and 5) distribute the reading materials in advance for&#13;
      better preparation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Self-Reported Knowledge&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  Respondents' self-reported ratings of all 12 issues presented in the course improved&#13;
      after the course, from the 2.45-3.43 range before the course to the 3.22-4.0 range at&#13;
      the end of the course. Respondents, who were mostly Bank/IMF economists,&#13;
      indicated having a fair knowledge of at least 5 subject issues before entering the&#13;
      course by giving a rating exceeding the mid-point on a 5-point scale, 3.0. They include&#13;
      "Consumption and Saving" "Investment," "Banking Crisis and Monetary Policy,"&#13;
      "Exchange Rate Management I," and "Exchange Rate Management II." By contrast,&#13;
      two topics that respondents reported as the least familiar areas before the course&#13;
      were "Fiscal Decentralization" and "Stabilization Policies, Poverty and the Labor&#13;
      Market." At least 30% of the respondents (N=8) gave a rating of either 1 or 2 out of 5&#13;
      on these two items in their pre-course ratings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  One of the key topics, "Stabilization Policies, Poverty and the Labor Market," was&#13;
      presented in two separate sessions: "Analytical Issues" and "Case Studies."&#13;
      Although designed to address the same issue, the two sessions had different&#13;
      reactions from the respondents. At the beginning of the course, respondents'&#13;
      knowledge of the contents presented in the two sessions were among the lowest&#13;
      (mean=2.45 and 2.50, respectively). Upon completion of the course, one of the items,&#13;
      "Analytical Issue"" had an increase in rating by 45%, the largest gain in knowledge&#13;
      reported by the respondents (mean=3.55). The other item, "Case Studies," also had a&#13;
      positive gain (29%) but did not improve as much as "Analytical Issues." Respondents&#13;
      reported the lowest post-course knowledge level on the "Case Studies" among all&#13;
      topics (mean=3.22). This suggested that the "Stabilization Policies, Poverty and the&#13;
      Labor Market" may require some adjustment to improve its effectiveness of the case&#13;
      study approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   l  A number of respondents commented on specific presentations as particularly&#13;
      valuable presentations for them. At least 5 respondents mentioned "Exchange Rate&#13;
      Management," "Capital Flows and Financial Market Integration," and "Consumption&#13;
      and Saving" for their clarity in presentation and interest of the issues.&#13;
