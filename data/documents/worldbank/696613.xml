THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA&#13;
PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:                      The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#13;
Loan Amount:                   DM 18 million&#13;
Beneficiaries:                 Private enterprises, including private farmers, participating financial&#13;
intermediaries.&#13;
Loan Terms:                    Single currency loan (SCL) in Deutsche Mark (DM) for twenty&#13;
years, including five years grace, at Bank's standard LIBOR-based&#13;
variable rate for SCLs denominated in DM.&#13;
On-lending Terms:              The NBM will rediscount the subloans of the participating financial&#13;
intermediaries (PFI) in DM at the cost of Bank funds plus a margin&#13;
of 100 basis points to cover the cost of administration and the credit&#13;
risk associated with lending to PFIs. The PFI subsidiary loans will&#13;
be extended on a first-come first-served basis, back-to-back to PFI&#13;
subloans to final beneficiaries. The PFIs will bear the full credit risk&#13;
of their subloans.  The subloans for private enterprise  and&#13;
permanent working capital finance will be provided with 1-10 year&#13;
maturities including up to 3 years grace. The subloans to farmers&#13;
will be provided with up to five year maturities including up to two&#13;
years grace period. The PFIs subloans to the beneficiaries will be&#13;
denominated in DM with variable interest rates based on the Bank's&#13;
lending rate plus the 100 basis points, plus a market-based PFI&#13;
spread. The final beneficiaries will bear the currency and the&#13;
interest rate risk.&#13;
Project Objective:             (a) promote growth of the private sector and improve conditions for&#13;
effective supply response from private enterprises and farmers;&#13;
(b) facilitate adoption of safe and sound banking practices; and&#13;
(c) promote credit market competition.&#13;
Project Description:           (a) Private Sector Finance (DM 14 million) for projects of private&#13;
enterprises to improve   profitability by increasing output or&#13;
improving efficiency; and (b) Private Farmer Finance (DM 4&#13;
million) for projects of private farmers to expand agricultural output.&#13;
Benefits and Risks:            The expected benefits include: improved conditions for effective&#13;
supply response of private enterprises, including private farmers;&#13;
increased efficiency, value-added and profitability of private&#13;
enterprises and farmers; improved institutional capacity of&#13;
participating financial institutions to appraise subprojects and to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
assess and manage risk; and increased competition in the credit&#13;
markets.&#13;
Institutional weaknesses and skill deficiencies of banks and private&#13;
enterprise management is the main project-specific risk.  It is&#13;
addressed through technical assistance to improve PFI's capacity to&#13;
assess and manage risk, by keeping open access to eligible PFIs, and&#13;
through increased supervision. There is also a risk concerning PFI&#13;
intermediation capacity -- macroeconomic volatility and uncertain&#13;
prospects may adversely affect PFIs' willingness to engage in term&#13;
lending. The PFI credit risk and the foreign exchange risk of final&#13;
beneficiaries has been decreased by extending a single currency loan.&#13;
On the macro level, the macroeconomic instability is the main risk,&#13;
which is addressed by the FESAC and the SAL, which is currently&#13;
under preparation, and through on-going policy dialogue with the&#13;
IMF. There is also a geo-political risk because of instability in the&#13;
Balkan region.&#13;

THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA&#13;
PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.01         The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia became a sovereign state in April 1992 and&#13;
a member of the World Bank in December 1993. It is a small, landlocked, mountainous country of about&#13;
26,000 square kilometers and two million people. The rate of population growth is just under one percent&#13;
per year and the country's income per capita was US$790 in 1994. Nearly half the area of the country&#13;
is devoted to agriculture, split about equally between cultivated area and pastures. Industry is the&#13;
dominant sector, accounting for 43 percent of GSP and for 48 percent of the total employment.&#13;
1.02         Although overshadowed in recent years by the difficult process of transition to a market&#13;
economy, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia possesses a diversified and potentially sound&#13;
economic base. Legal and institutional frameworks are being strengthened to better suit a market&#13;
economy and the policy framework has been substantially liberalized. Recognizing the difficulties of&#13;
achieving an adequate supply response and efficiency gains in enterprises owned and operated by the&#13;
public sector, the Government plans to privatize the socially-owned enterprises. About 705 companies&#13;
have been privatized by March 1996 under the 1993 Privatization Law, in addition to about 440&#13;
enterprises privatized under the former Yugoslav legislation. The privatization program under the&#13;
Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (FESAC) envisages the privatization of about 1,200&#13;
enterprises by end-1996.&#13;
1.03         The ownership reform of the state sector is supplemented by a broad program to support&#13;
growth of indigenous private sector enterprises. About 77,000 new private firms were registered by May&#13;
1995, of which about 38 percent have already opened for business. In agriculture, there are about&#13;
177,000 privately-owned farms. In the 1990-1994 period, employment in the private sector enterprises&#13;
increased from about 60,000 to 100,000 employees, with a similar increase of employment in private&#13;
agriculture. The private sector participation in GDP has grown from about 10 percent in 1990 to an&#13;
estimated 20 percent in 1995.&#13;
1.04         The growth of the private sector has been inhibited by several factors, including crowding&#13;
out by the public sector from access to capital, raw materials and infrastructure. The proposed Project&#13;
is expected to have a meaningful impact on the overall transition process by promoting development of&#13;
the private sector by providing financial support to private enterprise investment programs. Investments&#13;
financed by the proposed Project will yield positive effects regarding employment and income generation&#13;
capacity of the private sector, including private farmers. It will also contribute to further transformation&#13;
of the banking system by encouraging competition. Through hands-on involvement with individual banks&#13;
in the process of banks and projects appraisal, it will help to improve banks' operational policies and&#13;
business practices.&#13;
1.05         To support the proposed Project, the Government has requested a Bank loan of DM 18&#13;
million. The proposed Loan would include: a private sector finance component of DM 14 million for&#13;
investments of private enterprises active in the manufacturing and services sectors; and a private farmer&#13;
finance component of DM 4 million for investments of private farmers.&#13;

II. ECONOMIC AND SECTOR ENVIRONMENT&#13;
A. Macroeconomic Developments&#13;
2.01           Against the backdrop of the loss of markets, as the CMEA and the Yugoslav Federation&#13;
broke up, the economy of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia took a hard hit. In the 1992-93&#13;
period, attempts to stabilize the economy failed owing to a rapidly shrinking revenue base and the very&#13;
high inflation. In 1994, however, the Government implemented strict budgetary discipline with tight&#13;
wage and monetary policies to turn the economy back from the brink of hyperinflation. Thus, the fiscal&#13;
deficit, which had averaged 12 percent of GDP in 1992-93, was cut to 3 percent of GDP by 1994. The&#13;
rate of (December-on-December) inflation, peaking at 1,925 percent in 1992, was brought down to 230&#13;
percent in 1993, 55 percent in 1994 and about 9.2 percent in 1995. There was also a significant price&#13;
liberalization. In early 1992, price controls covered about 40 percent of items in the retail price index.&#13;
By late 1994, the direct price controls covered about 19 percent of items in the retail price index and the&#13;
list continues to be revised downwards. At present, price controls cover mostly public utilities. Items&#13;
not subject to price controls, but closely monitored, include milk, heating and urban transport.&#13;

Econonmc Report ly 1995&#13;
2.02           The period since independence has also been characterized by sharp and sustained fall in&#13;
GDP (Table 2.1). GDP fell by about 12 percent in 1992 and 1993, the decline slowed down to about&#13;
6 percent in 1994 and to about 2 percent in 1995. Industry and mining recorded a 42 percent fall in real&#13;
terms between 1990 and 1994, but the decline slowed to 10.7 percent in 1995. Heavy industry was&#13;
extremely affected by the loss of traditional export markets (in the SFRY and the CMEA area) and the&#13;
severing of traditional links with sources of supply. The construction sector also took a hard hit due to&#13;
the loss of overseas markets for construction services and the sharp decline in domestic investment.&#13;
Value added in the sector fell by 46 percent, in real terms, between 1990 and 1994, in addition to the&#13;
21 percent drop in activity over the period 1986-89. Sectors directly affected by regional tensions, such&#13;
as trade, tourism, transport and communication also contracted, in real terms, by 36, 15 and 48 percent,&#13;
respectively, in the 1990-94 period. The agriculture sector with an average 3.3 percent contraction was&#13;
the least affected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
2.03         Gross domestic investment declined from about 32 percent of GDP in 1990 to around 18&#13;
percent in the 1993-94 period due to uncertainties facing the economy. In addition, as the crisis in the&#13;
banking sector intensified, investment decisions became difficult because of high and volatile rates of&#13;
inflation. Investment financed by the central government stagnated below 1 percent of GDP during 199 1-&#13;
93 and rose to 2.7 percent in 1994. Gross investment of the enterprise sector averaged 14 percent of&#13;
GDP in the 1991-94 period.&#13;
2.04         The registered unemployment rate increased steadily from 17 percent in 1990 to about&#13;
20 percent in 1994. Employment in socially-owned and mixed enterprises fell by 22 percent between&#13;
1990 and 1994; or about 112,000 jobs were lost, of which 56 percent were from industry. The&#13;
retrenchment continued in 1995 with additional 15,000 jobs shed under the FESAC program.&#13;
Employment in the private sector nearly doubled, from 60,000 to 100,000, but not enough to fully offset&#13;
the decline.&#13;
2.05         Some trade liberalization has taken place since independence with the removal of several&#13;
quantitative restriction, and many goods are subject to free trade. Nevertheless, distortions remain,&#13;
including the presence of import quotas on a number of agricultural products, such as wheat, the use of&#13;
export subsidies, and the imposition of various duties and special levies which can thwart the published&#13;
(apparently low) tariff rates. Reforms of the trade regime are currently being considered by the&#13;
Government in the context of a proposed Structural Adjustment Credit/Loan.&#13;
2.06         Exports from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have typically comprised semi-&#13;
processed manufactured goods, such as ferrous metal components, iron and steel, and textiles and&#13;
consumer manufactures, primarily footwear and clothing. Merchandise exports averaged US$1.2 billion&#13;
annually in 1992-94, and increased by about 11 percent in 1995. The loss of export markets in eastern&#13;
Europe and the Middle East has been largely responsible for the disproportionate fall in manufactured&#13;
exports, while exports of goods has risen as markets in western Europe gained greater importance.&#13;
Consumer goods (food, beverage and tobacco) accounted for 22 percent of the value of goods exported&#13;
in 1992-94 minerals and manufactures were close to 65 percent and the rest, 12 percent, were machinery&#13;
and capital goods.&#13;
2.07         In 1992, total imports of goods and non factor services were US$1.23 billion, down from&#13;
US$1.63 billion in 1990. During 1993 imports rose marginally to US$1.3 billion, increasing to US$1.64&#13;
billion in 1994, and producing a current account deficit of US$370 million or about 10 percent of GDP.&#13;
The total merchandise imports, consumer goods accounted to roughly 20 percent, mineral and&#13;
manufactures to roughly 65 percent, and capital goods to 15 percent.&#13;
2.08         Medium-Term Outlook. Economic management in the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia has been continuously improving since independence, leading to better macroeconomic balance&#13;
and substantially reduced inflation (about 6 percent projected for 1996). The contraction of economic&#13;
activity appears to be levelling off. With the prudent macroeconomic management, the economic decline&#13;
could feasibly be reversed to an average growth of about 3 percent per year in the 1996-1999 period.&#13;
The growth of total consumption, however, needs to be kept in check, since the domestic savings would&#13;
be needed to finance critical investments, for the debt service payments and to restrain the external&#13;
borrowing requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. Structural Reforms&#13;
2.09          Complementing economic stabilization, a structural adjustment program was adopted in&#13;
1993. The program's objectives were to address the macroeconomic constraints and create an enabling&#13;
environment for private sector development, speed up the restructuring of the socially-owned enterprise&#13;
sector and achieve sustainable growth in the medium-term. The main components of the program were:&#13;
(a) strengthening the legal and regulatory environment to suit the emerging market economy;&#13;
(b) streamlining and speeding up the privatization process; (c) reforming the enterprise and banking&#13;
sectors; and (d) enhancing mobility in the labor market. The structural reform program execution was&#13;
initially slow, in part because of the need for exhaustive consensus building and practical preparations.&#13;
2.10          The Government's reform efforts in the 1993-94 period were assisted by the Bank's&#13;
Economic Recovery Credit. As part of the initial program, most prices were freed, import tariffs lowered&#13;
and non-tariff barriers to trade removed. Some reforms were introduced in the enterprise and banking&#13;
sectors to cap the expansion of credit and hasten the restructuring of the enterprise sector. Labor market&#13;
reforms were also initiated, as were reforms of the social safety net. These initial reforms were followed&#13;
by a more comprehensive reform programs in the enterprise, financial and social sectors which the&#13;
Government adopted in early 1995, along with a program of additional stabilization measures. The 1995&#13;
program is supported by the Bank's FESAC program, which was approved by the Board in May 1995.&#13;
2.11          Enterprise Reform. The Government's strategy for enterprise reform in the medium-&#13;
term centers on privatization and private sector development. In the short-term, the reform program aims&#13;
to force the socially-owned enterprises'/ to restructure by imposing hard budget constraints. Their&#13;
continued operations are to be based on their viability, and there will be no government subsidies or&#13;
bailouts. Consequently, the rediscounts by the National Bank of Macedonia (NBM), which has been the&#13;
customary way of financing enterprise losses, were abolished as of March 1994, and the government&#13;
guarantee program for loans to enterprises was discontinued as of October 1994.&#13;
2.12          For the largest 25 politically sensitive loss-makers2/, the Government has introduced the&#13;
Special Restructuring Program (SRP). The losses of these enterprises accounted in 1993 for about 13&#13;
percent of GDP, or more than 80 percent of the total losses in the enterprise sector and over 60 percent&#13;
of the bad debts in the banking system. Under the SRP, the enterprises are isolated from their creditors,&#13;
including the banking system, and provided with technical assistance to develop consolidation plans that&#13;
would restore a positive cash flow. The enterprises which are not able to generate the positive cash flow&#13;
in the specified time period are to be liquidated. By end-1995, the 16 loss-makers were broken up into&#13;
about 135 successor enterprises, of which 115 filed for privatization, and the liquidation decision was&#13;
made for four enterprises. A Mining Law, to be submitted to the Parliament by mid-1996, is expected&#13;
to help with the final resolution of issues concerning the remaining three enterprises which operate in the&#13;
mining sector.&#13;
1/     However, socially-owned enterprises in the agricultural sector are not included in the FESAC program and will be&#13;
addressed by the Structural Adjustrnent Credit/Loan.&#13;
2/     The list includes 23 large conimercial enterprises and two public utilities, railways and electricity generation and&#13;
distribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
C. Private Sector Development&#13;
2.13         Like most other reforming economies of Central and Eastern Europe, the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has followed a two-pronged approach to increasing the share of the&#13;
private sector in the economy: (a) implementation of an extensive program for the privatization of the&#13;
socially-owned enterprises; and (b) an open entry policy for the private sector reinforced by the creation&#13;
of an enabling environment for the sector. The supply response of the private sector has been&#13;
encouraging. From 1990 to mid-1995, the number of private enterprises in the former Yugoslav Republic&#13;
of Macedonia has drastically increased to about 77,000 from 5,800.&#13;
2.14        iLal. Institutional and Policy Framework. In the 1992-1995 period the Government&#13;
has made notable progress in completing the regulatory framework generally following the model of EU&#13;
countries, which will create a favorable legal and regulatory enviromnent for private sector development&#13;
and growth. The most important elements of the legal framework, which are being put in place, include:&#13;
(a) a Commercial Companies Law, which is in its final draft to be presented to the Parliament in May&#13;
1996; (b) a Bankruptcy Law, including a US Chapter-11 type of financial restructuring and a clear&#13;
definition of the right of creditors, to be presented to the Parliament in June 1996. The Government also&#13;
intends to amend the regulation on collaterals and to build up the capacity of the court system. In a&#13;
related effort, the Government plans to strengthen the role and capacity of the Land Cadastre Office and&#13;
to introduce other measures which will clarify the treatment of land as a collateral and improve efficiency&#13;
of the agricultural land market; (c) a Law on Denationalization and Restitution, which is submitted to the&#13;
Parliament, and is expected to resolve the issues currently deterring privatization of urban properties; and&#13;
(d) modernization of the Law on Standards and Intellectual Property Rights is also in progress.&#13;
2.15         Progress has been also made in developing an appropriate institutional framework for&#13;
private sector development. A Privatization Agency, established in 1993, is the principal institution in&#13;
charge of implementing the privatization. The role of the Chamber of Commerce, with mandatory&#13;
membership for all registered companies, has been expanded to include functions needed by the private&#13;
sector, including private sector promotion. The private companies are currently in the process of&#13;
establishing a voluntary membership organization akin to the Chamber of Commerce, which would be&#13;
specialized to deal with issues specific to the private sector. An Industrial Property Protection Office has&#13;
been established in the Ministry of Development and a Department of Standardization has been established&#13;
in the Ministry of Economy. Both Ministries have also expanded their functions to include private sector&#13;
promotion aspects. The Government is receiving technical assistance to complete and strengthen the&#13;
regulatory and institutional framework for the private sector from a number of bilateral and multilateral&#13;
donors.&#13;
2.16         The policy environment is changing and has been made more favorable to the private&#13;
sector. Entry to the economy has been liberalized, and there is no legal discrimination against the private&#13;
sector. Economic policies, including price policy, have also been liberalized. A new, non-discriminating&#13;
Tax Law has been enacted in lanuary 1994. It introduced a flat corporate tax rate of 30 percent.&#13;
Dividends are exempt from taxation. Since interest income is taxed, this measure specifically promotes&#13;
private ownership. Accelerated depreciation is allowed for up to 25 percent of profits before taxation,&#13;
and carry-over of capital losses is permitted. Imported production equipment is eligible for tax deduction&#13;
and equipment related to environmental protection is tax exempt. These measures aim to stimulate private&#13;
investment and the development of private initiatives in industry, transport and tourism sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
2.17         The Government considers foreign investment to be an important means to raise additional&#13;
development resources. It has liberalized entry for foreign capital and provided tax and other incentives&#13;
to foreign investors, which are comparable to or better than those offered by other countries in the region.&#13;
The new Tax Law offers automatic three-year tax holiday and tax holiday without time limits for&#13;
investments made in areas declared as underdeveloped, flat 30 percent corporate tax rate and free tax&#13;
status if the 30 percent of taxable income is reinvested, exemption from custom duties for imported&#13;
equipment and services, and 90 percent repatriation of dividends. Nevertheless, foreign investment in&#13;
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, including joint ventures, has been low compared to other&#13;
refbrming economies in the region. Of the 3,500 letters of intent received by the Ministry of Foreign&#13;
Affairs, only few have materialized. The foreign investments, including joint ventures, accounted for&#13;
about 1.8 percent of the total private investments as of mid-1995. To address this problem, the&#13;
Government intends to streamline the institutional framework for approval of foreign investments and to&#13;
introduce well-focussed foreign investment promotion programs. Technical assistance has been requested&#13;
from a number of bilateral donors.&#13;
2.18         Privatization. Socially-owned and mixed-ownership enterprises in the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia comprised 1,856 enterprises in early 1994 and employed about 324,000 workers,&#13;
primarily in the trade, construction, agriculture and textile sectors. In an attempt to address the&#13;
shortcomings of social ownership, former Yugoslavia introduced legislation in 1989 (the Law on Social&#13;
Capital) for the transformation of social ownership. Implementation of this law was left to the republics&#13;
and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia partially or fully privatized about 440 enterprises by&#13;
allowing employees to buy "internal shares".&#13;
2.19         The current privatization program is governed by the Law for Transformation of Socially-&#13;
Owned Enterprises (the Privatization Law), which was approved in June 1993. The Government has&#13;
targeted 1,200 enterprises for privatization under the law, representing 79 percent of all socially-owned&#13;
and mixed ownership enterprises, 78 percent of employment, and 53 percent of assets. Banks,&#13;
monopolies Oargely confined to public utilities) and agricultural cooperatives-- a total of 388 enterprises-&#13;
are not subject to the Privatization Law. Of the enterprises targeted for privatization, 100 are large, 263&#13;
are medium and 837 are small, representing only 5 percent of assets. The Government intends to&#13;
complete the program by the end of 1996.&#13;
2.20         The privatization program  is based on a case-by-case approach.  However, the&#13;
Government has also introduced a version of the mass privatization scheme through the asset-to-asset&#13;
swap program. The Privatization Law allows the use of frozen foreign exchange deposits, which have&#13;
been removed from the banks' balance sheets, for purchase of enterprise shares, housing and business&#13;
premises. The asset-to-asset swap at the same time reduces the claims on the Government created by its&#13;
assumption of foreign exchange deposit related liabilities. Technical instructions, which define the&#13;
guiding principles of swaps of frozen foreign deposits for shares and other socially-owned assets, were&#13;
issued by the Ministry of Finance in December 1994, and the scheme is now operative. Certificates&#13;
issued to depositors are generic (i.e., they can be applied toward the purchase of shares in any enterprise&#13;
and the purchase of business premises), but are restricted to exchange for shares or assets targeted for&#13;
privatization (to prevent the creation of quasi money).&#13;
2.21         After initial difficulties, privatization (under the FESAC auspices) has gained momentum&#13;
in 1995. By the first tranche release in May 1995, about 147 enterprises have been privatized; 114 small,&#13;
18 medium and 15 large enterprises. By mid-March 1996, privatization was completed for 705&#13;
enterprises, of which 67 are large, 120 medium and 518 small enterprises. For the FESAC second&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
tranche release, a total of 791 enterprises should be privatized (or liquidated). This target is expected&#13;
to be achieved by mid-1996.&#13;
2.22         Private Sector.   The private sector has witnessed considerable growth since&#13;
independence. By May 1995, there were about 77,000 registered private enterprises, a more than 13 fold&#13;
increase since end-1990. About 29,000 private enterprises are active and about 10,000 are handicrafts.&#13;
Most private activity is in trading due to the opportunities presented by the disruption of formal trade&#13;
caused by the embargoes, the lower risk and smaller capital required, the quick return, and the tradition&#13;
of trading among the people. Manufacturing and related activities account for less than 10 percent of the&#13;
total private enterprise activities. They typically employ labor intensive technologies, and the production&#13;
functions are typically assembly and basic, low value-added activities. About 25 percent of private&#13;
enterprises are engaged in services of which transport, tourism and personal services are the most&#13;
important.&#13;
2.23         While a significant progress has been made to create an enabling business environment&#13;
for the private sector, a number of surveys have shown that there are still some areas of concern,&#13;
especially regarding the lack of business premises, inadequate market information and rudimentary&#13;
marketing techniques used by the private sector, skill deficiencies concerning business planning and book-&#13;
keeping and the inadequate access to finance. The private sector needs for business premises is being&#13;
met by the program for business premises privatization launched in early 1995. About 150,000 square&#13;
meters of business premises are to be offered to the private sector through an asset-to-asset swap scheme&#13;
under the FESAC program. The Government intends to sell all business premises without legal&#13;
encumbrances by the end of 1996. Legal encumbrances on the rest are to be resolved after the adoption&#13;
of the Restitution Law and completion of the scheme is expected in 1997. In a parallel effort with IDA's&#13;
technical assistance, the Government is building a new legal framework concerning ownership and the&#13;
right of use of business premises including leaseholds.&#13;
2.24          Access to working capital finance for private companies is difficult due to the crowding&#13;
out by the large socially-owned enterprises. Difficulties in access to finance are further complicated by&#13;
the general unwillingness of banks to extend term-credits due to the perceived uncertainties in the&#13;
economy. This attitude is exacerbated by the lack of skills in the banks to assess price and manage&#13;
financial risk associated with private sector borrowers and their projects, and to efficiently collect on&#13;
collaterals. As a result, investment finance with medium-to long-term credit maturities is practically not&#13;
available. The majority of private companies finance new investments exclusively from retained earnings,&#13;
which limits their growth potential. The proposed Project aims to address this problem by providing&#13;
investment and working capital financing on non-discriminating terms and with adequate maturities.&#13;
2.25         Private Farming. Agricultural sector in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#13;
accounted for about 20 percent of GSP and 16 percent of exports in 1994. Almost 45 percent of the&#13;
country's population lives in rural areas and the welfare and incomes of rural population are closely&#13;
linked to agriculture. Agriculture is based on about 662,000 hectares of arable land and a further&#13;
640,000 ha of pasture (together accounting for about 50 percent of the total country's area). The arable&#13;
land is used to produce a variety of crops including cereals, industrial crops, fruits and vegetables. The&#13;
pastures support a substantial sheep industry, including profitable lamb exports.&#13;
2.26          Agricultural production has traditionally been a predominantly private sector activity.&#13;
As a result of the downsizing of the socially-owned enterprise sector, farming is expected to assume&#13;
increasing importance in the medium-term. About 30 percent of the total arable land is cultivated by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
about 217 agricultural enterprises, which account for about 9 percent of the total enterprise employment.&#13;
The remaining 70 percent is owned and cultivated by some 177,000 farmers with farms of an average&#13;
2.6 hectares. Farms are operated almost exclusively by labor of the extended family, and women are&#13;
often the primary managers of the family's home-based livestock and vegetable/fruit production units.&#13;
2.27         The presence of private sector activity in farming has helped the agriculture sector adjust&#13;
to the country's changing macroeconomic environment in recent years. Some policy reforms in the sector&#13;
have taken place, for example, direct financial support from the budget has been reduced from 10 percent&#13;
of agricultural GSP in 1991 to a projected 3 percent in 1996. Nevertheless, a significant further&#13;
liberalization remains on the agenda. For example, the market for certain important agricultural&#13;
commodities, such as wheat, sugar and dairy products, are still subject to price distortions. In the context&#13;
of the proposed Structural Adjustment Loan, the Govermnent is preparing additional policy reform&#13;
measures to be introduced in 1996 and 1997, including substantial reduction of agricultural subsidies,&#13;
removal of trade protection and other trade distortions, and deepening of privatization in agriculture.&#13;
2.28         Parallel to the agricultural policy reforms, the Government intends to strengthen the&#13;
assistance to private farming, including improved access to investment finance to increase agricultural&#13;
output and earnings in rural areas. The Government program for private farmers is supported by the&#13;
Private Farmer Support Project and by the proposed Project.&#13;
1II. BANKING SECTOR&#13;
A. Regulatory and Institutional Framework&#13;
3.01         Legal Framework. A new legal framework for the financial sector is mostly in place.&#13;
The National Bank Act was adopted in April 1992, and amended in May 1993, together with the&#13;
enactment of the new Banking and Savings Institutions Law. Further amendments to the National Bank&#13;
Act and the Banking Law, aiming to harmonize the existing legislation with internationally accepted&#13;
standards, have been submitted to the Parliament in early 1996, as part of the FESAC second tranche&#13;
release conditions. A Securities Act, a Financial Transaction Law and an Insurance Law were adopted&#13;
in 1992, and a Foreign Exchange and International Transactions Law in 1993. An Accounting Law was&#13;
enacted in 1992 and amended in 1994, and new amendments, which are expected to fully harmonize the&#13;
law with the internationally accepted standards, are being prepared. This will include a new chart of&#13;
accounts for the banking sector. Existing legislation encourages the entry of new, well capitalized banks&#13;
with sound managers and reputable owners.  Sound and efficient private banks, along with the&#13;
improvement of existing banks through the effective enforcement of prudential regulations, and more&#13;
competitive market conditions will yield a healthier and more efficient banking system.&#13;
3.02         National Bank or Macedonia. NBM was established as the country's central bank in&#13;
April 1992, following the enactment of the National Bank Act. NBM is independent and responsible to&#13;
the Parliament which appoints the Governor and the eight other Board members for a seven-year term.&#13;
The National Bank Act mandates NBM to be responsible for the stability of the national currency, the&#13;
regulation of money supply, the payment system and the supervision of the banking sector. The building&#13;
of NBM's institutional capacity started in 1993 with technical assistance from the International Monetary&#13;
Fund (IMF), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and other donors to&#13;
improve its organizational structure, monetary operations, banking regulation and supervision, bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
reporting and accounting, and information technology. This has yielded major improvements in monetary&#13;
and foreign exchange policy management, including abolishment of interest rate controls and of automatic&#13;
refinancing, liberalization of the exchange rate and of exchange rate markets, introduction of monetary&#13;
programming and increasing use of indirect mechanisms for central bank interventions.&#13;
3.03         On the banking supervision side, NBM is in charge of: (a) issuing bank licenses;&#13;
(b) issuing prudential regulations; (c) exercising off-site and on-site supervision; and (d) applying&#13;
sanctions on banks that fail to comply with the regulations. In order to be licensed, banks have to have&#13;
a minimum capital of DM 3 million (DM 1 million for the branch of a foreign bank) and to submit to&#13;
NBM a comprehensive and well-documented application file. Special licenses are required for a bank&#13;
to engage in foreign exchange and international transactions. For these operations, the minimum capital&#13;
required is DM 9 million. According to the new amendment to the Banking Law under consideration&#13;
by the Parliament, the minimum capital will be increased to DM 7 and DM 21 million, respectively.&#13;
3.04         Prudential regulations cover liquidity position and the capital adequacy of banks, large&#13;
exposures and loans to connected parties, level of term transformation and loan concentration,&#13;
classification of risk portfolios and the level of provisions, foreign exchange risk exposure, and internal&#13;
control systems of banks. The prudential regulations concerning liquidity, capital adequacy, asset&#13;
classification and provisioning and exposures to connected parties have already been issued by NBM in&#13;
the 1992-1994 period. Under the FESAC auspices, the regulations were amended in November and&#13;
December 1995 and are now fully harmonized with international standards. With the latest amendments&#13;
the prudential regulatory enviromnent in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is fully satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank.&#13;
3.05         The development of on-site and off-site supervision is a long-term process. NBM is&#13;
developing its supervision capacity with training and technical assistance from the IMF and the USAID.&#13;
The special audits of the four largest banks, which were completed by international auditors under the&#13;
Bank's Economic Restructuring Loan, have provided a good baseline information, as well as the models&#13;
for future annual audits. By mid-1995, NBM has developed prudential reporting standards and is already&#13;
receiving monthly reports from banks and performing off-site supervision. The on-site supervision started&#13;
from March 1995 according to the established supervision schedule. The Supervision Department has&#13;
played a major role in restructuring Stopanska Banka.&#13;
3.06         Bank Rehabilitation Agency. Bank Rehabilitation Agency (BRA) was established in&#13;
early 1994. In coordination with NBM, it is empowered to intervene in a failing bank, invest on&#13;
Government's behalf, appoint a new board and managers, and sell the bank as a whole or in parts. The&#13;
BRA is headed by a General Manager under a supervisory board. The General Manager was appointed&#13;
in April 1994, and he has now 20 professional staff and foreign technical assistance. BRA's role under&#13;
the FESAC program focuses on administration and collection of the non-performing assets removed from&#13;
the banks' balance sheets.&#13;
B. Banking Sector Structure&#13;
3.07         The banking sector in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as inherited from the&#13;
former Yugoslavia, was recognizably similar to that of market economies although with significant&#13;
structural distortions. At end-1994, the structural problems, which became severe enough to bring the&#13;
banking sector to the edge of banking crises, were affecting about 63 percent of the total banking sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
balance sheet, including the frozen foreign exchange deposits of households3/, the non-performing foreign&#13;
exchange denominated loans'/ and the non-performing domestic currency loans5/. The market-related&#13;
structural problem was the excessive concentration, including Stopanska's dominance of about 65 percent&#13;
in the domestic deposit and credit markets. The banking system stability was also threatened by the&#13;
protracted agony of Foreign Trade Bank, with about 20 percent share in both domestic and credit&#13;
markets.&#13;
3.08          These structural problems have been addressed by the FESAC. The non-performing&#13;
assets (in domestic and foreign currencies) and the foreign exchange deposits related claims on NBM,&#13;
including the corresponding liabilities, have been removed from balance sheets of banks and placed with&#13;
the BRA. The market concentration problem was addressed by substantially reducing the size of&#13;
Stopanska Banka (bringing its market share to less than 40 percent) and by creating five smaller regional&#13;
banks from its largest (and formerly independent) branches in Bitola, Kumanovo, Ohrid, Prilep and&#13;
Tetovo. Foreign Trade Bank was orderly liquidated, thereby creating a space for growth of new private&#13;
banks. Other important aspects of the FESAC banking sector reform program included a program to&#13;
strengthen prudential regulations and their harmonization with international standards, and the change in&#13;
corporate governance and incentives through full privatization of the banking sector.&#13;
3.09          For the most part, the implementation of the banking reform supported by the FESAC&#13;
has been successful.  New prudential regulations have been issued thereby creating a regulatory&#13;
environment comparable to international standards. The balance sheet of the banking sector has been&#13;
successfully cleaned from problems inherited from the former Yugoslavia. The banking sector has been&#13;
fully privatized and the market dominance of Stopanska has been reduced. Some problems, however,&#13;
remain. The privatization of Stopanska has been accomplished, but the corporate governance has not&#13;
sufficiently improved, due to the lack of strategic investor, fully independent from government's&#13;
influence. In addition, Stopanska remains undercapitalized and is still experiencing occasional liquidity&#13;
problems. A search for a suitable foreign investor, capable of providing effective corporate guidance,&#13;
is under way. The remaining problems with Stopanska, however, will not affect implementation of the&#13;
proposed Project, as the bank will not be accepted for participation until it is able to meet the&#13;
qualification criteria.&#13;
3.10          Selected indicators from the aggregated balance sheet of the banking sector are shown in&#13;
Table 3.1. The situation on May 31, 1995 shows the results of the implementation of reforms due as the&#13;
FESAC first tranche conditions. After the removal of the frozen foreign exchange deposits and of the&#13;
Paris Club loans, the exit of Foreign Trade Bank and the removal of the part of the non-performing assets&#13;
from the Stopanska Banka balance sheet, the total banking sector assets contracted from US$4.2 billion&#13;
to US$1.5 billion, of which Stopanska Banka accounted for 65 percent. The share of loans to economic&#13;
agents increased to about 37 percent of the total banks' assets, of which Stopanska accounted for 56&#13;
percent. The situation on December 31, 1995 shows further transformation of the banking sector.&#13;
3/     About 1.3 million accounts in four banks amounting to about US$1 billion, and accounting for about 30 percent of the&#13;
balance sheet of the banking system and balanced by claims on NBM.&#13;
4/     The non-perfonning foreign exchange loans were funded by foreign borrowings, amounting to about US$900 million&#13;
or about 28 percent of the banking sector balance sheet.&#13;
5/     These amounted to US$220 million or about 5.5 percent of the banking sector balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
Stopanska's share of assets contracted to about 40 percent of the total assets, its loan portfolio to 29&#13;
percent of the total loans, and its capital to 21 percent of the total capital in the banking systems.&#13;

3.11           There are, however, new reasons for concerns indicating that some fragility remains in&#13;
the sector and that it will take some time until the situation is fully stabilized. The immediate concern&#13;
is a significant drop of the share of loans in the total assets of the banking system from 32 percent as of&#13;
May 31 to about 15 percent as of December 31, 1995. There is a similar problem in terms of resource&#13;
mobilization, as the share of deposits in the total banking liabilities dropped from 30 percent to 13 percent&#13;
in the same period. The reasons for the disintermediation trends are not entirely clear. Another problem&#13;
is a worsening of the loan portfolio quality, as the percentage of loans in arrears in the banking system&#13;
increased to about 30 percent. This is likely a consequence of the enforcement of hard budget constraints&#13;
under the FESAC, which was primarily targeted to large socially-owned lossmakers. The protection from&#13;
creditors afforded to lossmakers under the SRP, however, effectively passed-on the shock to their&#13;
privately-owned suppliers. The worsening of the financial position of the private suppliers has, in turn,&#13;
negatively affected the credit relations with their banks.&#13;
3.12           The proposed Project will address these problems by carefully scrutinizing banks which&#13;
have applied for participation and by maintaining high banks qualification standards. At the subproject&#13;
level, the risk will be addressed by training the participating banks in projects and credit risk appraisal&#13;
and by introducing sophisticated computer-supported analytical tools developed by the Bank. Initially,&#13;
there will be no free limits, and the free limits will be set on a bank-by-bank basis once a bank has&#13;
clearly demonstrated the satisfactory quality of its appraisal process.&#13;

C. Credit Markets&#13;
3.13          Market Conditions. Liberalization of interest rates in the banking markets of the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia took place in 1992. As a matter of policy, the NBM discount rate has&#13;
been always positive in real terms, with liquidity credits being priced significantly above the discount&#13;
rate, and the interest rates on compulsory reserves and T-bill subscriptions very significantly&#13;
underpriced6/. Against the background of December-on-December inflation of about 55 percent in 1994&#13;
and 9.2 percent for 1995, the deposit rates in the first half of 1995 were in the 6-12 percent range for&#13;
demand deposits and in the 30-45 percent range for term deposits. The lending rates were in the 75-95&#13;
percent range (50-70 percent positive, in real terms), with an average lending margin of about 40 percent.&#13;
3.14          The inflation expectations were adjusted in mid-1995. The positive results of banking&#13;
refbrms under the FESAC also started to be felt. NBM increased informal pressure on banks to lower&#13;
their lending spreads. As a result, the deposit rates fell to a level of 10-12 percent for shorter than three-&#13;
month deposits, and 17-22 percent for term deposits, with an average of 16 percent. The lending rates&#13;
fell to a level of 25-30 percent for both short- and long-term loans, (about 15-20 percent positive, in real&#13;
terms), with the lending spreads averaging about 15 percent. Overall, the conditions in the banking&#13;
sector markets in the second half of 1995 showed notable improvement and the markets seem to be on&#13;
a good track to be fully stabilized.&#13;
3.15          In order to avoid introducing the credit market distortions, the Bank funded subloans to&#13;
the private sector and farmers are to be freely priced by the participating banks according to prevailing&#13;
market conditions. For the subsidiary loans extended by the apex to the PFIs, there were no fully&#13;
satisfactory benchmarks. Therefore, the price of funds extended to large banks by the foreign export&#13;
credit agencies was used as an approximation. The Bank funds are likely to be of somewhat longer&#13;
maturities; average maturity of three years is expected for the private farmer finance and about four to&#13;
five years for the private sector finance, as compared to one to three years maturities of the typical export&#13;
credits. The use of Bank funds entails, however, a significantly higher transaction cost. As a result, the&#13;
subsidiary finance to PFIs was priced within 10-15 basis points range of the cost of benchmark funds.&#13;
3.16          Credit Market. The banking markets in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are&#13;
small even when taking into account the small size of the economy. The total deposit market volume as&#13;
of end-1995 was about US$301 million and the credit market volume about US$353 million. On the&#13;
demand side, the market has been traditionally dominated by socially-owned enterprises. On the supply&#13;
side, the major player in the market was Stopanska Banka followed by another two large banks, which&#13;
together accounted for over 90 percent share of the total credit market. The unstable macroeconomic&#13;
environment and structural problems in the economy, compounded by the lack of capacity of banks to&#13;
analyze and properly price their risks, have brought very conservative lending practices and exorbitantly&#13;
high spreads. The maturities of available investment credits have shortened to below two years, and&#13;
credit for capital investments involving imports is practically not available, other than funds provided by&#13;
the foreign export agencies.&#13;
§V     The NBM discount rate in July to December 1995 was 15 percent (expected inflation 8 percent), the interest on&#13;
compulsory reserves was 5.8 percent and on liquidity credits 30 percent with interest penalty rate of 45 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
3.17         Parallel to the main-stream market dominated by large banks and socially-owned&#13;
enterprises, there is an active market used by private enterprises. It is funded by the private banks' own&#13;
funds and is not larger than about US$20-30 million. The typical terms are one to two month maturities&#13;
without grace period and the collection rates have traditionally been about 90 percent. Term finance is&#13;
generally unavailable. Small- and medium-size private enterprises, including export-oriented enterprises&#13;
and the new private enterprises which have grown to employ over ten people, are the most negatively&#13;
affected by the lack of term-finance. This is particularly problematic because the supply response from&#13;
these types of enterprises holds a potential for reversing the country's current economic decline.&#13;
3.18         The situation is even worse in the credit market segment catering to farmers and small&#13;
private agrobusinesses. The main channel for agriculture finance has traditionally been Stopanska Banka.&#13;
The conservative lending climate coupled with liquidity and solvency problems experienced by Stopanska&#13;
Banka in the period since independence have practically closed the credit market for farmers and private&#13;
agrobusinesses. In the 1992-1995 period, the total volume of the segment catered by the private banks&#13;
was in the US$1-2 million range. The proposed Project aims to overcome the credit supply problems&#13;
in this market segment. Of the proposed DM 18 million Bank loan, DM 4 million has specifically been&#13;
targeted for loans to private farmers hoping to encourage diversification by new banks into the&#13;
agricultural finance. Specific measures will be taken to expand the outreach of participating banks to&#13;
include the rural areas.&#13;
3.19         Credit Demand. During the preparation of the proposed Project a demand survey was&#13;
undertaken to assess the investment and financing needs of the private sector. The survey included a&#13;
number of large banks which have applied for participation. The survey has found that there is an&#13;
appreciable level of private sector capital formation, which can serve as an indicator of the potential&#13;
demand for medium- to long-term credit at reasonable terms. The total private sector investment in fixed&#13;
assets in the 1992-1994 period are estimated to be about US$139 million, with construction of business&#13;
premises accounting for US$79 million and production equipment for US$51 million. Most of the total&#13;
private sector investments has traditionally been funded by their own funds, and the remainder by bank&#13;
credits. Since the average medium-term loan maturity was about 18 months in the 1992-1994 period,&#13;
and the interest rates were very high, the viable demand has obviously been depressed. With recent&#13;
changes in credit market conditions, the investment demand is expected to substantially increase. The&#13;
surveyed banks have estimated an increase in the total credit demand for investment loans of the private&#13;
sector to about US$60 million annually, excluding the newly privatized or soon to be privatized&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
3.20         The expectations concerning increase in private sector credit demand were confirmed in&#13;
informational interviews with senior managers of a number of large, profitable, recently privatized&#13;
enterprises. All interviewed managers shared the opinion that there is a high (and currently hidden)&#13;
future demand for investment loans. Investment in socially-owned enterprises has been suppressed so&#13;
far due to the delay in privatization, since investments would have increased the value of enterprises&#13;
thereby making the internal privatization more costly. Managers of privatized enterprises were confident&#13;
that the investment demand would pick-up and grow with the pace of privatization.&#13;
3.21         Subsidized Credits. With the abolition of selective credits as of March 31, 1994, as&#13;
agreed under the Economic Recovery Credit, explicit credit subsidies in the former Yugoslav Republic&#13;
of Macedonia were significantly reduced and the remaining subsidies mostly confined to agriculture. In&#13;
the agricultural finance area, the most important forms of subsidy were the directed credit and the interest&#13;
rebate scheme. The volume of directed credit was about US$14 million in 1994, but the subsidy was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
thereafter abolished. The interest subsidy scheme, totalling about US$18 million in 1994, included a 15&#13;
percent rebate on interest paid on loans for wheat, corn and tobacco storage, and for milk and wheat&#13;
production. The rebate for storage loans was paid to the storage enterprises, and that for milk and meat&#13;
production directly to producers. In the 1995 budget, the allocation for interest subsidies was reduced&#13;
to around US$4 million, and no money has been earmarked in the 1996 budget. Other significant&#13;
subsidies still persist in the sector, including rebates on seed purchase, price support and premiums paid&#13;
on selected agricultural commodities and various trade protection measures. These other forms of&#13;
subsidies are also being reduced. Explicit planned budget subsidies for agriculture in 1996 amount to&#13;
around US$26 million, which is about half of the 1994 amount. Further subsidy reductions and&#13;
liberalization in the sector are a key part of the dialogue with the Government under the proposed SAL/C.&#13;
IV. PROJECT RATIONALE&#13;
A. The Bank Group Strategv for Assistance&#13;
4.01         The reform strategy in Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is similar to that of other&#13;
central planning economies trying to make a transition to a market economy. The reform priorities&#13;
include: (a) macro-economic stabilization; (b) accelerating the transfer of ownership to the private sector;&#13;
(c) rationalization of productive sectors to make them efficient and internationally competitive; and&#13;
(d) providing social protection to the affected segments of the population. The Government remains&#13;
committed to moving decisively and coherently across a broad front to sustain the reform effort.&#13;
4.02          In intensive dialogue over the past three years, the Government and the Bank have found&#13;
considerable agreement on the priorities for adjustment and development. The Bank's country assistance&#13;
strategy, which was presented to the Board on May 16, 1995, comprises several strategic themes as&#13;
reference points for guiding the overall program in support of the reform effort. The Bank aims to:&#13;
(a) facilitate and support the structural reform and the transformation to a market economy; (b) contribute&#13;
to financing balance-of-payments requirements; (c) support sectoral adjustment and development efforts;&#13;
and (d) help mobilize resources from both official and private sources.&#13;
4.03         The initial support to the Government's reform program was provided through the&#13;
Economic Recovery Credit/Loan of US$80 million, which has been fully utilized. The SDR 54.7 million&#13;
FESAC, approved in May 1995, aims to advance critical elements of the market reform, including:&#13;
(a) comprehensive reform of the banking sector and banking markets; (b) isolation of largest loss-making&#13;
enterprises, including hard budget constraints, leading to liquidation or privatization of major loss&#13;
makers; (c) comprehensive privatization program; and (d) social safety net reform program. A Structural&#13;
Adjustment Credit/Loan, aiming to support further policy changes in the transition to a market economy,&#13;
is currently under preparation. The specific SAC/L objectives are to further the trade reform, to reduce&#13;
interventions and subsidies in the agricultural sector, thereby reducing distortions in the agricultural&#13;
products markets, and to privatize the socially-owned agroenterprises.&#13;
4.04         The proposed Project is in concordance with the country assistance strategy. Continued&#13;
support to privatization and private sector development is critical to the success of transition. Fully aware&#13;
of the pressing needs for investment and permanent working capital finance, which will allow the private&#13;
sector to effectively utilize its development potential, and facing difficulties in mobilizing resources under&#13;
the terms and conditions which effectively meet the private sector demand, the Government has requested&#13;
the Bank's support. The Bank intends to deliver this support through the proposed Project which is fully&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
consistent with the Bank's assistance strategy and supports development of the private sector activities,&#13;
including private agriculture. The proposed Project is processed in tandem with the proposed Private&#13;
Farmer Support Project, which seeks to promote institutional changes in the agricultural sector. This&#13;
project will develop agricultural extension services, private veterinary services and design an agricultural&#13;
already covered wholesale market system and promote agricultural research. Thus, the two projects are&#13;
highly complementary, with the proposed Private Farmer Support Project seeking to create an enabling&#13;
environment for the private agriculture and the private farmer finance component of the proposed Project&#13;
aiming at facilitating investments of private farmers.&#13;
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
4.05          Since its independence, the Government has successfully established the legal and&#13;
institutional framework necessary for a market economy. The role of the state in both macro- and micro-&#13;
economic management has changed. On the macro level, the new policies emphasized liberalization&#13;
(e.g., price, foreign trade, interest rates, entry and exit policies), decentralization and competition (e.g.,&#13;
in banking, industry, agriculture), and market and private sector orientation. At the micro-level, the&#13;
Government has already disengaged from the operational management of enterprises. It is enforcing their&#13;
financial discipline, and plans to fully divest the socially-owned holdings in the near future. Financial&#13;
policies and entry to the banking sector and markets have been liberalized, resulting in the emergence of&#13;
new private institutions.&#13;
4.06          At the macro level, the Bank has been involved in the transition process in the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from the very beginning. Since the framework for the development&#13;
of a market economy and the structural reforms are at an advanced stage of implementation, the Bank's&#13;
focus is now shifting to the micro level to promote growth of the private sector and to support the process&#13;
of transition through institution-building work and by providing well-calibrated financial assistance,&#13;
through banks already operating on sound financial and commercial principles, to competitive private&#13;
enterprises. The proposed Project aims at addressing critical needs which impair the supply response of&#13;
the private sector in manufacturing, services and agriculture.&#13;
4.07         The lessons from the Bank operations in other countries also point to the need that a&#13;
major financial sector reform operation with macro objectives, such as the FESAC in the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, should be followed by a credit line operation to solidify the&#13;
transformation of the financial sector on a bank-by-bank basis thereby helping to build the banks'&#13;
institutional capacity. The proposed Project will provide an opportunity to assist the banks, through&#13;
training and hands-on consulting, and to improve their lending, risk-management, supervision and loan&#13;
administration practices. This is especially important for the new, smaller private banks which normally&#13;
do not have access to high quality technical assistance. Participation of many banks will also stimulate&#13;
competition in the credit market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
V. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives and Scone of the Proposed Project&#13;
5.01         The principal objectives of the proposed Project are to: (a) promote growth of the private&#13;
sector and create conditions for an effective supply response from viable private enterprises and farmers;&#13;
(b) facilitate the adoption of safe and sound banking practices; and (c) stimulate competition in the credit&#13;
market. The proposed Project will provide an opportunity for the Bank to follow-up on the level of&#13;
individual banks with its assistance, initiated under the FESAC, to transformation and strengthening of&#13;
the banking sector.&#13;
5.02         The proposed Project would be supported by a DM 18 million IBRD loan. The loan&#13;
would be used to provide:&#13;
(a)    Private Sector Finance to creditworthy private industrial and agricultural enterprises to&#13;
improve profitability by increasing output or improving efficiency; and&#13;
(b)    Private Farmer Finance to viable private farmers to increase their output.&#13;
5.03         The loan will be initially divided into DM 14 million for private enterprise finance and&#13;
DM 4 million for private farmer finance. The new private banks, which are expected to be the main&#13;
intermediaries for the credit line, have little or no experience with private farmer finance. The crowding&#13;
out of the private farmers from access to the Bank credit line, was therefore, a potential problem which&#13;
needed to be addressed. To ensure the private farmers access to finance and, at the same time, encourage&#13;
the private banks to diversify into this sector, the DM 4 million has been preallocated for credit to private&#13;
farmers. This initial allocation will be regularly reviewed once the implementation starts, and the&#13;
necessary adjustments to reflect the apparent market demand for Bank funds will be made, if and when&#13;
necessary. After the first use of Bank funds, with financing to be continued from the roll-over fund,&#13;
there will be no specific allocations and the utilization of Bank funds will be on a first-come first-served&#13;
basis.&#13;
5.04         The proposed Project does not have a technical assistance component. However, a&#13;
comprehensive technical assistance program of US$1.25 million, of which US$300,000 under the&#13;
proposed Private Farmer Support Project was financed by IDA, has been developed in coordination with&#13;
a number of bilateral and multilateral donors. The technical assistance program would address issues&#13;
impeding the flow of credit to the private sector and provide training and hands-on consulting services&#13;
to participating banks in the areas critical for the*successful implementation of the proposed Project.&#13;
B. Project Components&#13;
5.05         The Private Sector Finance ComRonent would provide investment and permanent&#13;
working capital loans to private enterprises, including agricultural enterprises. Due to the lack of&#13;
medium- to long-term foreign exchange financing in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,&#13;
provided on terms and conditions attractive to the private sector, the growth of private sector activities&#13;
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been less than satisfactory. The Bank finance is&#13;
targeted to the most viable private enterprises aiming at improving their efficiency and profitability, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
at increasing their output. On the average, the funds would revolve about three times during the 20-year&#13;
maturity of the proposed Loan. As a result, the DM 14 million component for the private sector finance&#13;
would mobilize financing of about DM 45 million during the life of the proposed Loan.&#13;
5.06            Access to private sector finance would be open to viable private enterprises'/, including&#13;
agricultural enterprises. Eligibility of enterprises and subprojects would be determined based upon:&#13;
(a)    financial viability of a subproject, with the expected financial rate of return of minimum&#13;
15 percent. The economic rate of return, which must be minimum 15 percent, will be&#13;
checked by the Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs) and the Bank for all&#13;
subprojects affected by the significant price or tariff distortions;&#13;
(b)    satisfactory financial condition of the prospective borrower and capacity to bear the&#13;
foreign exchange risk;&#13;
(c)    presentation of a satisfactory business plan and financing plan for components of the&#13;
subprojects which are not covered under the PFI subloan, including adequate assurances&#13;
from cofinanciers or a proof that the enterprise has enough own funds to be able to&#13;
implement the project; and&#13;
(d)     clearance by competent authorities concerning environmental aspects.&#13;
5.07            The subloans will be denominated in DM  to match the prospective export revenues of&#13;
final beneficiaries. Interest rates would be variable, based on the Bank's lending rate, plus a spread to&#13;
cover administrative expenses and the PFI related credit risk, plus a market-based PFI spread, so as not&#13;
to introduce the credit market pricing distortions. Proceeds of the subloans would be used to fund capital&#13;
investments, including permanent working capital needs. For the private enterprises in the manufacturing&#13;
sector, the subprojects will typically aim to improve quality, packaging or to address other product&#13;
deficiencies; to improve production cost structure; to address production bottlenecks; or, when having&#13;
a reasonable prospect to increase exports, to increase capacity to produce exportable products. For the&#13;
tourism and services sector, the subprojects will typically aim at improving quality, value-added, or cost&#13;
structure of services; to address bottlenecks in service delivery; or to increase the capacity to provide the&#13;
foreign exchange earning services.&#13;
5.08            The Private Farmer Finance Component. Access to this component will be open only&#13;
to private farmers. The DM 4 million has been specifically earmarked for farmers, because there is a&#13;
high likelihood that they would be otherwise crowded out from access to Bank funds. The average&#13;
maturity of the subloans is expected to be about three years. With an assumption that the private farmer&#13;
will turn out to be efficient users of Bank funds, and therefore, manage to stay within the initially&#13;
allocated range, the DM 4 million earmarked for the private farmer finance would mobilize financing of&#13;
about DM 25 million during the 20-year maturity of the proposed Loan.&#13;
7/     The term private refers to enterprises which were established by private entrepreneurs and enterprises originally in&#13;
public ownership which have been privatized to have at least 51 percent private ownership and are independently&#13;
operated by the private owners. The 51 percent privatc ownership is deemed satisfactory, since the remaining 49&#13;
percnt will be socially owned. The social ownership in the specific former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#13;
circumstances is usually fmgrnented, it does not allow for state interference and the 51 percent majority is enough to&#13;
ascertain a decisive vote in enterprise management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
5.09         The interest rate will have the same basis as that for the private investment finance&#13;
component. The eligibility of subprojects will be determined based on their financial viability, with an&#13;
expected financial rate of return of minimum 15 percent, in real terms, and a satisfactory repayment&#13;
capacity of the prospective borrowers. For all subprojects having as production input or output&#13;
agricultural commodities subject to price or tariff distortions, economic rate of return of minimum 15&#13;
percent will be required. Eligibility criteria, which include the economic rate of return, currently apply&#13;
to wheat, sugar and dairy products.&#13;
5.10         The subprojects will finance investment and working capital related to production of crop&#13;
and livestock. Incremental short-term credit would be provided for production inputs such as land&#13;
preparation, seed, fertilizer, agrochemicals, animal feed, hired labor and transportation. Investment credit&#13;
would be provided for farm mechanization, livestock and horticulture. Livestock subprojects would&#13;
include sheep and pig breeding and fattening, beef fattening, dairy and poultry (broilers and eggs).&#13;
Investment inputs financed would include machinery, equipment, civil works (e.g., barns, feed storage&#13;
facilities), planting material and breeding stock.&#13;
5.11         Financial Rate of Return. Since the interest rate on subloans is to be variable and the&#13;
final borrowers are to bear the interest rate risk, the minimum acceptable financial rate of return of a&#13;
subproject has been set to ensure that the subproject would always generate enough income to service the&#13;
subloan. Because the subloans are to be denominated in DM, the financial rate of return will be&#13;
calculated on a DM basis. The minimum rate of return will be 15 percent annually in nominal DM&#13;
terms. This reflects the sum of: the highest average historical interest rates for LIBOR-based DM loans&#13;
with six month maturities in the period 1986-1995; the apex institution margin over the Bank's lending&#13;
rate, i.e., 75 basis points net; and the average bank margin taken by the banks in the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia when intermediating DM denominated funds.&#13;
5.12         Economic Rate of Return. Calculation of the economic rate of return will not be&#13;
required, unless requested by the Bank based on a presumption of the existence of price or tariff&#13;
distortions affecting a subproject. Prices in the economy of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#13;
have been liberalized and now reflect the market supply and demand. Notable exceptions are the prices&#13;
of certain agricultural commodities. Furthermore, the shadow wage rate in certain sectors of the&#13;
economy is somewhat below the current market rate. Therefore, in practical terms, the difference&#13;
between the financial and the economic rate of return can generally be safely ignored.&#13;
5.13         For subprojects using as production inputs goods subject to known price or tariff&#13;
distortions, or where the price of output is subsidized, the calculation of the economic rate of return will&#13;
be required. For such subprojects to be eligible for Bank finance, the economic rate of return must be&#13;
minimum 15 percent, in real terms. At this time,, significant policy induced price distortions still persist&#13;
in agricultural markets and apply to wheat, dairy and sugar producers. Therefore, until the subsidies&#13;
issues have been sorted out under the SACIL, the eligibility of subprojects involving these commodities&#13;
as input or output will be subject to the explicit calculation of the economic rate of return using border&#13;
prices.&#13;
5.14         Technical Assistance. While the proposed Project does not have a technical assistance&#13;
component, a comprehensive technical assistance package directly related to the implementation of the&#13;
proposed Project has been agreed and will be funded by a number of bilateral and multilateral sources.&#13;
The technical assistance program of about US$1.25 million comprises the following components, to be&#13;
provided by:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
(a)    the Bank, before the proposed Project effectiveness: (i) installation, including training&#13;
of participating banks, of an interactive project implementation management system,&#13;
which comprehensively covers Bank funds management, subloan administration,&#13;
collection and billing, procurement and disbursement management, trouble shooting,&#13;
implementation forecasting and full reporting capacity; and (ii) training of participating&#13;
banks in techniques of credit risk appraisal and subproject appraisal, including the use&#13;
of computer-based tools with full financial statements and financial ratio analysis features,&#13;

C. Project Cost and Flnancing Plan&#13;
5.15           An estimate of the total cost associated with the proposed Project is shown in Table 5.1.&#13;
This cost does not include the cost of subprojects which will be funded after the closing date of the&#13;
proposed Loan from repayments of subloans financed by Bank funds.&#13;

Z/ Private farmers' funds and PFI funds&#13;
5.16           Based on the discussions held with prospective PFIs and final beneficiaries, it is expected&#13;
that the line of credit will largely finance foreign costs and that the local costs of the private sector&#13;
investmnent projects will be funded by the beneficiaries themselves from retained earnings and by the PFI&#13;
credits. This results in a financing scheme under which the Bank financing would cover DM 18 million&#13;
equivalent, or about 70 percent of the total cost of the project. The financing plan developed with these&#13;
assumptions is presented in Table 5.2.&#13;

D. Environmental Aspects&#13;
5.17           The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has an Environmental Law, which sets&#13;
standards generally comparable to those in EU and which is soon to be amended with the Bank's&#13;
assistance. The proposed Project has been classified in Category B. Environmental aspects would be&#13;
addressed on a subproject-by-subproject basis. In order for subprojects to be financed from the Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
credit line, clearance by competent authorities concerning the environmental impact of the proposed&#13;
investment would be required. Environmental impact analysis would have to be prepared for all&#13;
investment projects that so require under the Environmental Law. It is expected that the equipment to&#13;
be purchased from subloan proceeds will be mostly with environmentally sound technology of foreign&#13;
make and, therefore, will not post environmental issues. While reviewing the subprojects submitted by&#13;
the PFIs, the Bank will ensure that the subprojects are environmentally sound and that the clearance by&#13;
competent authorities has been received. The PFIs will monitor compliance with environmental&#13;
regulations in the course of normal subproject supervision. The Bank would also check, on a sampling&#13;
basis, environmental compliance of larger subprojects during its supervision missions.&#13;
5.18         A manual for Environmental Review Procedures has been developed by the authorities&#13;
in agreement with the Bank and would be used by PFIs in the process of subproject appraisal for&#13;
screening environmental issues. It is expected that the manual would also be used by the PFIs when&#13;
appraising other projects, as a means to assess the risk of potential environmental liabilities which might&#13;
affect the borrowers' credit rating.&#13;
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND ONLENDING ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Loan Terms and Conditions&#13;
6.01         The proposed Loan of DM 18 million will be made to the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia for a period of 20 years, including five years of grace. It will be a standard LIBOR-based&#13;
variable interest rate single currency loan (SCL) in DM. In order to provide quick and efficient support&#13;
for the development of the private sector (including private farmers), a phased formula for extending&#13;
Bank finance is proposed. Once the DM 15 million of the proposed Loan has been committed, Board&#13;
approval would be sought for additional financing of DM 18 million under the same terms and conditions&#13;
as the proposed Loan.&#13;
6.02         NBM will rediscount eligible loans of PFIs, which would channel these resources to&#13;
eligible subborrowers for eligible subprojects. Lending arrangements include: (a) Loan Agreement&#13;
between the Bank and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; (b) Subsidiary Financing Agreements&#13;
between NBM and the PFIs; and (c) Subloan Refinancing between NBM and the PFIs, back-to-back to&#13;
Subloan Agreements between the PFIs and the final borrowers. Subsidiary Financing Agreements by at&#13;
least two PFIs satisfactory to the Bank is a condition of effectiveness. The Subsidiary Financing&#13;
Agreement will include: (i) terms and conditions of subsidiary loans extended to a PFI; (ii) terms and&#13;
conditions of PFI subloans to final borrowers; (iii) commitment by a PFI to follow agreed appraisal&#13;
procedures and eligibility criteria; (iv) agreement to establish or strengthen a technical appraisal unit;&#13;
(v) agreement to establish a Credit Committee; (vi) agreement to undertake external audits and to&#13;
implement auditor's recommendations; and (vii) agreement to provide periodic reports on the portfolio&#13;
financed from Bank funds. Subloan Agreements will refer to particular subprojects and must be of a&#13;
form and content satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
6.03         The NBM's subsidiary to PFIs ("subsidiary loans") will be extended on a first-come first-&#13;
served basis and back-to-back to the PFI subloans to final beneficiaries, with identical amounts, maturities&#13;
and repayment schedules. The subsidiary loans to PFIs will be made in DM at the variable interest rate&#13;
equivalent to the Bank's lending rate, plus a NBM spread of 100 basis points. The NBM spread is to&#13;
cover the credit risk associated with subsidiary finance plus the real NBM cost, including administration&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
cost, commitment fees, applicable interest charges and other incidental expenses. The spread will be&#13;
reviewed by the Bank from time to time, and may be adjusted to better reflect the actual cost and risks&#13;
of the apex.&#13;
6.04         The PFIs would onlend the funds to eligible final borrowers for eligible projects. The&#13;
PFIs will assume the full credit risk. The subloans will be made in DM at variable interest rates priced&#13;
on the basis of the Bank's lending rate plus the NBM margin, plus a market-based PFI spread. The&#13;
beneficiaries will assume the currency risk and the interest rate risk. Subsidiary and subloans terms and&#13;
spreads will be reviewed by the Bank from time to time.&#13;
6.05         The PFIs, which will bear the full credit risk, will apply their own risk exposure limits&#13;
on the total financing for subprojects as decided by their Board and codified in their operations and credit&#13;
policies. The average exposure of banks in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is currently&#13;
about 70 percent of the total project cost. The maximum exposure of any PFI will not exceed the limits&#13;
set by NBM prudential regulations.&#13;
6.06         Private Sector Finance. Maturities of subloans for the private sector will range from&#13;
one to ten years, including a grace period of up to three years. Grace periods and repayment schedules&#13;
will be flexible to suit requirements of individual projects and enterprises. Maximum subloan size will&#13;
be DM 800,000. Exceptions may be authorized by the Bank on a case-by-case basis based on&#13;
significantly increased foreign exchange earning potential of a particular project and/or final borrower.&#13;
This maximum will be reviewed and may be adjusted from time to time.&#13;
6.07         Private Farmer Finance. Maturities of subloans for private farmers will be of up to&#13;
five years, with a grace period of up to two years. Grace periods and repayment schedules will be&#13;
flexible to suit requirements of individual projects and borrowers' cash flow and overall repayment&#13;
capacity. Maximum subloan size will be DM 200,000. Exceptions may be authorized by the Bank on&#13;
a case-by-case basis.&#13;
6.08         Repayments. Repayments by the PFIs to the NBM will match the repayment schedules&#13;
of subloans to the final borrowers. Should the final borrower prepay all or part of the subloan prior to&#13;
maturity, the PFI would be required to immediately prepay its subsidiary loan to NBM. In case of&#13;
arrears in principal or interest repayment on any due date from a final borrower, the PFI will nevertheless&#13;
be liable for the payment to NBM. NBM will establish a rollover fund with resources generated by&#13;
repayments of all subloans under the Project. Resources from the rollover fund will be available to&#13;
finance additional subprojects, which meet the same eligibility criteria, or to service the Bank loan.&#13;
6.09         Free Limit. Initially, a free limit for both types of finance will not be established. The&#13;
Bank will continue to review subloans proposed by each PFI until a PFI's appraisal capacity is deemed&#13;
satisfactory. At this time, a free limit for the particular PFI will be established. This free limit will be&#13;
PFI specific and may be adjusted from time to time.&#13;
B. Lending Arrangements&#13;
6.10         The Apex Arrangements. Financing for both components would be provided through&#13;
an apex arrangement to allow open access of new PFIs. The apex functions would include: (a) appraisal&#13;
and qualification of the PFIs; (b) refinancing of PFI loans to final beneficiaries; (c) monitoring of the use&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
of Bank funds; (d) administration of the disbursements and collection (repayments) of funds advanced to&#13;
or received from PFIs; (e) monitoring of PFIs to ensure their continued qualifications; and (f) reporting&#13;
to the Bank on all aspects of Project implementation.&#13;
6.11          Initially, the Bank would retain the responsibility for the appraisal and qualification of&#13;
the PFIs and for periodic evaluation of their eligibility. This function would be discharged in close&#13;
cooperation with NBM. In particular, in accordance with agreed criteria (Annex 1), the Supervision&#13;
Department of NBM would screen financial institutions which have applied to participate in&#13;
intermediation of the Bank funds and propose to the Bank financial institutions which are deemed capable&#13;
to qualify. As part of the normal supervision process, NBM will continue to monitor soundness of PFIs&#13;
including their capacity to appraise subprojects, inform the Bank of any deterioration of their financial&#13;
and operating conditions, and ensure that the PFIs subject their financial statements for external auditing&#13;
on a regular basis. If a PFI, due to the deterioration of its financial condition, ceases to meet the&#13;
qualification criteria, it will be disqualified. The decision on the PFI disqualification will be made by&#13;
the Bank, upon appraisal of its financial condition.&#13;
6.12          The International Relations Department of NBM, or another entity selected in agreement&#13;
with the Bank, would have the primary responsibility for operational functions, including: (a) providing&#13;
subsidiary finance to PFIs; (b) monitoring the use of Bank funds, including procurement and&#13;
disbursement; (c) collecting from PFIs; (d) repaying to the Bank; and (e) reporting on the use of project&#13;
funds and other matters related to the implementation of the proposed Project9/. A unit having specific&#13;
responsibility to administer the Bank loan funds (called Project Implementation Unit or Apex Unit) will&#13;
be established in the International Department of NBM or in another institution satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
The unit should be staffed with experienced, adequately trained individuals. Establishment of this unit&#13;
and adequate staffing with well-trained and experienced professionals is a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
6.13          Monitoring and reporting would require a good accounting and management information&#13;
system in order to track disbursements and collection of funds and to provide the necessary reports in&#13;
accordance with Bank procedures (e.g., procurement, reporting). Such a system is being developed in&#13;
the Bank and will be installed in the apex unit and in all PFIs. The system is a computerized, interactive&#13;
database system with full capacity for loan accounting and loan service administration. The system&#13;
includes modules for procurement and disbursement management and monitoring, and has troubleshooting&#13;
and forecasting capacities and the full reporting capacity.&#13;
6.14          Participating Banks. The developmental objectives of the proposed Project are to:&#13;
(a) encourage competition in the credit markets; (b) strengthen the delivery system for private investment&#13;
and agricultural finance; and (c) promote adoption of safe and sound banking practices. It is, therefore,&#13;
desirable that as many eligible banks as possible participate in intermediating Bank funds. The private&#13;
banks have been encouraged to participate as PFIs, in order to increase the competition and to spread the&#13;
risk.&#13;
6.15          All banks operating in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are eligible to&#13;
participate provided that they meet the qualification criteria (Annex 1). The qualification criteria include&#13;
the following:&#13;
2/     Note that the project implementation unit will not be involved in credit decisions and/or in rationing credit among the&#13;
PFIs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
(a)    satisfactory fnancial position and capital adequacy meeting international standards, as&#13;
evidenced by external audits performed by auditors satisfactory to the Bank and according&#13;
to international accounting and auditing standards;&#13;
(b)    full compliance with NBM prudential regulations and other applicable legislation;&#13;
(c)    satisfactory financial policies and operating procedures, especially concerning loan&#13;
classification and provisioning and project appraisal, and adequate funding structure;&#13;
(d)    adequate profitability and satisfactory operational performance, especially concerning&#13;
past-due and non-performing loans and collection ratio for the total loan portfolio of&#13;
minimumrr 85 percent; and&#13;
(e)    satisfactory technical capacity to identify, appraise and supervise utilization of Bank&#13;
funds.&#13;
6.16           The PFIs' responsibilities include: (a) promotion and building of the project pipeline;&#13;
(b) subproject and borrower appraisal; (c) subloan administration and collection; (d) subproject&#13;
performance supervision; and (e) periodic reporting to the project implementation unit and the Bank. The&#13;
PFIs would be required to establish a technical unit, specialized in long-term project lending and properly&#13;
staffed. The unit will perform the appraisal and supervise all subprojects financed by a PFI. Appraisals&#13;
should be cleared by the respective PFI Credit Committee. A PFI is also expected to introduce&#13;
appropriate internal audits and controls.&#13;
6.17           To address possible inadequacy of the branch networks of PFIs, in terms of ability to&#13;
effectively reach individual farmers in rural areas, the PFIs will be allowed to use marketing, retail or&#13;
collecting agents, including savings institutions'°/. The relationship between a PFI and its agent will&#13;
be contractual, whereby an agent will receive a fee, and the PFI will continue to appraise the subloans,&#13;
make credit decisions, bear the credit risk and keep the loan in its portfolio until repaid. When acting&#13;
as marketing agents, the savings institutions will provide and disseminate information about the proposed&#13;
Project and on terms and conditions of borrowing. When acting as a retail agent, the savings institutions&#13;
will solicit subloan applications, prepare initial documentation and forward it to the respective PFI.&#13;
6.18           Ten banks have expressed interest in participating so far. These include: Komercijalna&#13;
Banka, Makedonska Banka, Almako, Kreditna Banka, Balkanska Banka, Invest Banka, Ohridska Banka,&#13;
Stopanska Banka Bitola, Tetovska Banka Tetovo and Stopanska Banka Skopje. At the outset, a minimum&#13;
of two eligible PFIs would be sufficient to start the proposed Project implementation.&#13;
6.19           Details on banks qualification process and the qualification criteria are provided in&#13;
Annex 1. In addition to a clean audit opinion on all financial statements given by reputable and&#13;
independent external auditors satisfactory to the Bank and based on full external audit (standard terms of&#13;
reference for external audits are provided in Annex 5), the Bank appraisal is based on two types of&#13;
criteria: (a) level of capitalization and capital adequacy, using international standards as qualification&#13;
10/    The savings institutions are privately owned savings and loan agencies which are, by their charter, limnited in dealing&#13;
with individualm and households. They are regulated by NBM. For the rural areas, they may have comparative&#13;
advantage over banks in terms of access to potential borrowers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
criteria; and (b) qualitative criteria showing that a bank has a satisfactory capacity to intermediate Bank&#13;
funds. Annex 2 discusses the process of appraisal and provides details on banks' financial position and&#13;
appraisals.&#13;
6.20          The appraisal of banks which have expressed interest in participation will start as soon&#13;
as a bank is able to present a full external audit as of December 31, 1995 completed by external auditors&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, according to the terms of reference provided in Annex 5. For banks which are&#13;
not able to pay for the full external audit because their boards are not willing to approve such expenses,&#13;
the external audits will be paid by the trust fund established by the Government of Netherlands.&#13;
According to the preliminary unaudited financial statements, at least four PFIs are deemed capable of&#13;
meeting the qualification criteria for participating in the proposed Project.&#13;
C. Loan Administration&#13;
6.21          Procurement. Procurement will be performed by final beneficiaries. For items which&#13;
cost less than DM 150,000 equivalent, procurement will follow normal commercial practices satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank`1/. The aggregate amount of such procurement will not exceed DM 7 million. Items which&#13;
cost DM 150,000 to DM 1.5 million equivalent would be procured through international shopping on the&#13;
basis of at least three competitive quotations obtained from suppliers in two eligible countries. The&#13;
aggregate amount of such procurement will not exceed DM 8 million. For items which cost more than&#13;
DM 1.5 million equivalent, international competitive bidding would be followed. For proprietary items,&#13;
direct contracting will be used. For technical assistance to help with preparation or implementation of&#13;
the subprojects, the final beneficiaries would follow the Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (Bank&#13;
Guidelines). The Bank would review and clear all contracts above DM 150,000 for the employment of&#13;
consulting firms and above DM 75,000 for the employment of individual consultants. The smaller&#13;
contracts will be reviewed on a sampling basis during regular supervision missions.&#13;
6.22          The PFIs will be required to maintain records of the procurement made under the Project,&#13;
with summaries of offers received and awards made under each subloan. These records would be used&#13;
by external auditors in auditing the PFIs' statement of expenditures. The first contracts cleared by a PFI&#13;
and all contracts above DM 1.5 million equivalent will be subject to prior review by the Bank. Review&#13;
of other contracts will be on a sampling basis during regular supervision missions. The Bank will&#13;
organize a procurement seminar for PFIs to assist them in acquiring the necessary procurement skills.&#13;
The first such seminar for the PFIs will be organized prior to loan effectiveness. In addition, consulting&#13;
assistance in procurement matters would be made available to PFIs. From time to time, procurement&#13;
seminars will also be organized for the final borrowers.&#13;
6.23          Disbursement.  Disbursements for the private sector finance component will cover:&#13;
(a) up to 100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures (cif) for directly imported goods; (b) up to 80&#13;
percent of locally produced goods, as well as for other items procured locally; (c) up to 100 percent of&#13;
expenditures for engineering, consultant services for the preparation of enterprise business plans and&#13;
restructuring programs, for the preparation of subproject applications and for subproject implementation&#13;
assistance, and for the development of management information systems; and (d) foreign expenditures&#13;
for technology transfer, licenses and other payments for specialized technology and associated equipment&#13;
II/    These typically include selection from a number of suppliers of the beat offer bawed on predefined selection criteria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
of proprietary nature. For the private farmer finance component, disbursements will cover up to 100&#13;
percent of foreign exchange expenditures under the subproject and up to 80 percent of local costs and/or&#13;
of items and services procured locally.&#13;
6.24         Due to the great number of small disbursements expected under the proposed Project,&#13;
disbursements under DM 750,000 million for expenditures for goods and training, DM 150,000 under&#13;
contracts for consulting firms and DM 75,000 under contracts for individual consultants will be made&#13;
against a certified statement of expenditures (SOE), for which appropriate documentation would be&#13;
retained by the PFIs and the apex. Disbursements above DM 750,000 million for goods and services,&#13;
DM 150,000 for consulting firms and DM 75,000 for individual consultants will be made on the basis&#13;
of full documentation. The Bank's reimbursement will be limited to expenditures made by a subborrower&#13;
not more than 180 days prior to the Bank's receipt of the request for reimbursement. A disbursement&#13;
seminar will be organized by the Bank at the time of loan effectiveness to familiarize the PFIs and the&#13;
implementing agencies with the disbursement procedures.&#13;
6.25         Special Account. Since the proposed Project would involve the financing of many small&#13;
items, a special account would be created in a mutually agreed bank to facilitate disbursements. Most&#13;
expenditures under the project (which are approved by the PFIs and subsequently authorized by the Bank)&#13;
would be met out of the funds in the special account. When appropriate, special commitments or direct&#13;
payment to foreign suppliers may also be used. The Bank would disburse an initial amount of&#13;
DM 750,000 into the special account upon effectiveness of the proposed Loan and would periodically&#13;
replenish the account on the basis of reimbursement requests. The replenishment amount would be&#13;
increased to DM 1.5 million after cumulative disbursements have reached DM 2.5 million. The&#13;
minimum application size for direct payments, reimbursement and Special Commitments until the&#13;
aggregate disbursements reach DM 2.5 million will be DM 150,000; thereafter, it will be DM 300,000.&#13;
6.26         Disbursement Schedule and Closing Date. The estimated disbursement schedule for&#13;
the project is contained in Annex 3. The expected disbursement of the loan is based on ECA/MENA&#13;
experience with similar operations and adjusted for specific circumstances in the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia. A review of the proposed Project implementation performance will be made on&#13;
or about September 30, 1997, i.e., about one year after loan effectiveness. If the implementation&#13;
performance is deemed unsatisfactory, the Bank will have an option to cancel the remaining loan amount.&#13;
The commitment amount which would indicate satisfactory implementation performance is DM 3 million,&#13;
and at least two PFIs should maintain their qualification. If, on the basis of performance review, the&#13;
Bank is satisfied with the performance record, the commitment period will be extended to September 30,&#13;
1998. The closing date for the loan is June 30, 1999.&#13;
6.27         Reports and Audits. The PFIs would submit to the Bank semi-annual reports on&#13;
commitments, disbursements, collections and arrears under the project to the Bank. In addition, the PFIs&#13;
would maintain proper accounts for subloans, including supporting procurement and disbursement&#13;
documents, which would be audited annually by external auditors acceptable to the Bank. Since most&#13;
subloans would be disbursed on the basis of SOEs, the regular annual audit of the PFI wouid have to&#13;
include a special opinion on the adequacy of SOE procedures. Audit reports have to be submitted to the&#13;
Bank no later than six months after the close of a PFI financial year. These audits should include a&#13;
certification that the PFI is in compliance with the financial covenants agreed under the proposed Project.&#13;

VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
7.01          The proposed Project is expected to contribute to reversing the country's economic decline&#13;
and to increasing the private sector's share in the economy, thereby facilitating the transition to a market&#13;
economy. Its objectives and development indicators are summarized in Annex 6. The proposed Project&#13;
would support viable private enterprises. Investments financed by the proposed Project would increase&#13;
their earnings and profitability, and yield positive effects regarding employment and income generation&#13;
capacity of the private sector. Through the demonstration effect, it may stimulate more open access to&#13;
the credit market for the private sector.&#13;
7.02         The farm investments and production inputs financed under the proposed Project would&#13;
enable farmers to intensify cultivation and animal husbandry and thereby increase agricultural output.&#13;
Short-term crop production credit would assist farmers to purchase improved seeds, fertilizers, and pest-&#13;
control chemicals, as well as finance land preparation and labor costs, as elements of improved technical&#13;
packages for crop production. Medium/long-term credit for investments in livestock production would&#13;
assist farmers to provide housing and stores for breeding, feeding and fattening operations, and improved&#13;
genetic stock for higher yields of milk, meat and wool. Investments in modern farm equipment would&#13;
enable farmers to achieve early and better crop plowing and sowing, better soil moisture infiltration and&#13;
storage, and reduced cultivation costs. These benefits would be further supported by the proposed Private&#13;
Farmer Support Project, which is being processed in parallel, and which will fund technical assistance&#13;
to further improve the enabling environment for the development of private agriculture.&#13;
7.03         The proposed Project will also contribute to the strengthening of the banking sector in&#13;
a number of aspects. Encouraging participation of small but financially viable new private banks will&#13;
promote competition in the credit markets. The process of bank appraisal, with the participation of&#13;
NBM, will help to practice on-site supervision; the discussions with senior banks management will help&#13;
in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each institution. The rigorous subproject appraisal required&#13;
by the proposed Project is expected to yield positive demonstration effects on banks, thereby helping to&#13;
better assess and manage financial risk, to improve banks' lending policies and appraisal procedures and&#13;
to improve their loan accounting.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
7.04         The recent reopening of the country's borders should help in stimulating trade and private&#13;
sector development. General instability in the Balkan region, however, remains an overhanging risk for&#13;
the implementation of the proposed Project. The macroeconomic instability, which could re-emerge&#13;
during the period until the transition to a market economy is completed, is also a risk. The reforms&#13;
supported by the FESAC, together with the ongoing dialogue with the IMF and the Bank's proposed&#13;
Structural Adjustment Loan should, however, minimize the risk of policy slippage which could lead to&#13;
macroeconomic instability.&#13;
7.05         The main project specific risk results from general institutional weakness, including skill&#13;
deficiencies of banks and private enterprise managements. This risk has been addressed by arranging&#13;
technical assistance for all participants in the proposed Project and covering the most important aspects&#13;
where skills deficiencies might jeopardize the Project's success. Close supervision of about 20 staffweeks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
during the first year of implementation and 16 staffweeks per year thereafter, rather than the Bank's&#13;
average of 12 staffweeks, will help to contain this risk.&#13;
7.06          Volatility and uncertain prospects can adversely affect the PFIs willingness to engage in&#13;
long-term lending to private enterprises or to diversify into agricultural lending. A general increase in&#13;
non-performing assets would decrease the PFIs capacity to take the credit risk associated with the&#13;
proposed Project. This risk is contained by a technical assistance to the PFIs to better manage risks, and&#13;
by strengthening their capacities to assess credit risk associated with particular borrowers and projects.&#13;
Credit risk of the PFIs and currency risk of the final beneficiaries has been decreased by extending a&#13;
single currency loan rather than the Bank's standard pooled loan.&#13;
VIII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
8.01          During negotiations, final agreements were reached on the following: (a) the single&#13;
currency loan terms, including loan currency and interest rate basis (para. 6.01); (b) the interest rate and&#13;
on-lending terms of PFIs (para. 6.03); (c) terms and conditions of subloans to the private sector and&#13;
farmers (paras. 6.06 and 6.07); (d) eligibility criteria for subproject to be financed of the private sector&#13;
(para. 5.06) and of farmers (para. 5.09); (e) eligibility criteria for PFI participation (para. 6.15); (f) the&#13;
content and form of Subsidiary Financing Agreements with PFIs (para. 6.02); (g) the apex arrangements&#13;
to implement the proposed Project (paras. 6.10-6.12); (h) procurement arrangements (paras. 6.21-6.22);&#13;
(i) disbursement arrangements and special accounts (paras. 6.23-6.25); (j) the content and schedule of&#13;
audit reports and on other reporting requirements (para. 6.27); (k) enviromnental review procedures&#13;
(para. 5.17); and () targeted commitment amount after the first year of implementation (para. 6.26).&#13;
8.02          Agreed Actions. At negotiations agreements were reached on the following:&#13;
(a)    Condition of Effectiveness, including: (i) signing of Subsidiary Financing Agreements&#13;
by at least two PFIs; and (ii) establishment of an apex unit for project implementation&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank; and&#13;
(b)    Implementation Performance Condition. The initial commitment cut-off date will be&#13;
September 30, 1997. At that time the Bank will review the implementation performance,&#13;
and, if satisfied, extend the loan commitment date to September 30, 1998.&#13;
8.03          Subject to the above agreements, the proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for a&#13;
single currency loan to the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in the amount&#13;
of DM 18.0 million at a Bank's standard variable interest rate for single currency loans for a period of&#13;
20 years, including five-year grace period, under terms and conditions outlined in Chapter VI.&#13;

Procedure for Accreditation of Banks and&#13;
Criteria for Banks Oualification&#13;
1.           Application for Participation. An application for participation of a financial institution&#13;
in the intermediation of the World Bank financed credit lines shall be filed with the Department of Bank&#13;
Supervision, National Bank of Macedonia.&#13;
2.           Papers Required. An application for participation should be accompanied by: (a) a full&#13;
set of documents and tables as listed in Attachment 2 of this document; (b) an outline of operational&#13;
policies and guidelines as specified in Attachment 3; (c) a brief corporate strategy outline as explained&#13;
in Attachment 4; and (d) a statement, signed by the Chief Executive Officer, that the financial institution&#13;
agrees to be subject to the Bank's appraisal process.&#13;
3.           Screening.  Upon submission of the application supported by the above listed&#13;
documentation, the National Bank of Macedouia (NBM) will review the application. According to the&#13;
qualification criteria listed in Attachment 1, the NBM would decide whether a bank qualifies for full&#13;
appraisal or not. If the opinion is positive, both the World Bank and the applicant bank should be&#13;
notified. A bank, which, according to the opinion of the NBM, does not meet the qualification criteria&#13;
will be informed in writing, including specific reasons for refusal of their application and advice&#13;
regarding necessary improvements before it could re-apply.&#13;
4.           Appraisal. The World Bank would appraise only banks for which a positive opinion by&#13;
the NBM has been received. If the appraisal shows that the bank's financial condition and intermediation&#13;
capacity is satisfactory to the World Bank, the bank would be advised to submit the papers necessary for&#13;
accreditation. Otherwise, the bank would be informed in writing as to why it has not been able to&#13;
qualify.&#13;
5.           Accreditation. The accreditation would be effected upon presentation of the following&#13;
documents:&#13;
(a)    Board Resolution - A copy of the resolution of the Board of Directors of a bank&#13;
authorizing the bank to sign a Subsidiary Financing Agreement (i.e., agree to take&#13;
subloans financed by the World Bank to refinance credits that it has extended to eligible&#13;
borrowers for eligible projects and expenditures), and designating two authorized&#13;
signatories (at least one signatory shall have the rank of vice president or officer of&#13;
equivalent rank to sign on behalf of the PFI all papers pertaining to the subloans);&#13;
(b)    Letter of Understanding, accepting for the World Bank financed projects and transactions&#13;
to: (i) adhere to the Operating Policy guidelines for World Bank financed credit lines;&#13;
(ii) establish a unit or an identifiable group to be responsible for approval and supervision&#13;
of Bank financed projects; (iii) establish a Loan Review Committee; and (iv) provide&#13;
training for the unit or group staff as advised by the World Bank; and&#13;
(c)    Agreement for the World Bank financed projects and transactions to: (i) adhere to&#13;
procurement and disbursement procedures of the World Bank; (ii) maintain loan accounts&#13;
and documentation; and (iii) submit annually externally audited financial statements&#13;

participate in the World Bank financed credit lines.&#13;
6.            Suspension/Termination of Accreditation. In case when a subsequent evaluation of the&#13;
eligibility of a participating financial institution (PFI) shows that the PFI has not maintained compliance&#13;
with the qualification and accreditation criteria and/or with the Operational Policy Guidelines applicable&#13;
for Bank financed credit lines, the PFI accreditation will be suspended. Once the reasons for suspension&#13;
have been satisfactorily addressed, the bank would be able to re-apply for participation.&#13;

Oualification Criteria&#13;
l.            A financial institution that seeks to participate in the Bank-financed credit lines should&#13;
be in a sound financial condition and have a satisfactory performance reflective of a healthy loan and&#13;
investment portfolio, and should adhere to sound operating policies and procedures. Specifically, a&#13;
financial institution must comply with the following qualification criteria:&#13;
(a)    The ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets should not be lower than 8&#13;
percent, of which minimum 4 percent should be primary capital.&#13;
(b)    It must have demonstrated satisfactory performance, including profitable&#13;
operations, for at least a year immediately preceding the date of application for&#13;
accreditation.&#13;
(c)    It must have satisfactory financial policies and operating procedures, including&#13;
satisfactory risk management, as a minimum including loan classification and&#13;
provisioning on an asset-by-asset basis, and diversified funding. Own funds,&#13;
including capital, should cover minimum 50 percent of the total loan portfolio.&#13;
(d)    It must be in compliance with the ceilings and limitations on loans to directors,&#13;
officers, stockholders, and related interests in accordance with the existing&#13;
regulations. A bank would be obliged to report to the National Bank of&#13;
Macedonia all assets where the exposure to a single borrower and affiliated&#13;
parties exceeds 10 percent of bank's capital.&#13;
(e)    The total past due loans must not exceed 15 percent of the total loan portfolio of&#13;
assets acquired after April 20, 1992. A financial institution whose level of&#13;
arrears exceeds the 15 percent ceiling may still apply for participation, providing&#13;
that the unimpaired capital and reserves are sufficient to meet the minimum&#13;
capital requirements. Appraisal of such a bank should finally determine whether&#13;
or not it will be allowed to participate.&#13;
(f)    It must have satisfactory credit appraisal policies and an organization,&#13;
management and staff with the requisite expertise to identify, appraise and&#13;
supervise the utilization of loans.&#13;
(g)    It must be in good standing with the National Bank of Macedonia, and be in&#13;
satisfactory compliance with all pertinent laws, rules and regulations to the&#13;
satisfaction of all regulatory authorities.&#13;
(h)    It must have a business strategy.&#13;

2.      The qualification decision is based on the level of capitalization and capital adequacy, profitability&#13;
and general financial condition of a bank and using international standards as qualification criteria, and&#13;
on qualitative criteria. The description of the appraisal and qualification process and the details on&#13;
qualification criteria are provided in Annex 1. The following qualitative aspects are studied at appraisal&#13;
in detail:&#13;
-       quality of management, managerial structure and human resources;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
general risk management - risk profile and exposure policies of the bank, policies and&#13;
methods used for asset/liability management, portfolio mismatches and gaps, funding&#13;
structure;&#13;
operationalization of risk management - existence of risk committee and loan committee,&#13;
their functions and responsibilities, rationale for and the disposition of lending authorities;&#13;
credit risk management - identification of risks, lending policies and procedures, asset&#13;
classification loan loss provisions, quality of credit appraisal;&#13;
information systems - data bases, computerization level and quality of management&#13;
information systems;&#13;
internal control and auditing systems;&#13;
- business strategy and future growth/diversification plans;&#13;
plans for external auditing (by international auditing firms) in the near future;&#13;
in the case of new private banks, their accumulated experience in banking business and&#13;
operations; and&#13;
staff training programs.&#13;
3.     For qualitative criteria, minimum standards acceptable to the Bank, rather than standards for&#13;
banks operating in developed market economies, are used. Quality of management is given major&#13;
importance at appraisal. Specific concerns include management appreciation of risks in the current&#13;
business environment and of financial market conditions, existence of a coherent growth and&#13;
diversification program, and management understanding of bank's major deficiencies and existence of&#13;
plans to address them. Staff skills and relevant experience are also appraised. However, because of the&#13;
developmental role of the proposed Project, willingness to develop such skills, if currently less than&#13;
satisfactory, is also acceptable for participation. Staff training and massive technical assistance would&#13;
be provided under the proposed Project and the proposed Private Farmers Support Project and supervised&#13;
by the PSD project team, to build the skill capacity to a fully satisfactory level. A summary of bank&#13;
appraisals is provided in Table A2.2&#13;

4.    One of the objectives of the proposed Project is to promote participation of new, smaller private&#13;
banks and be instrumental in increasing their institutional capacity. The banks which have applied for&#13;
participation, other than the core Stopanska, accounted as of December 31, 1995 for about 55 percent&#13;
of the total assets in the banking system, for about 75 percent of the total capital in the banking system,&#13;
for about 69 percent of the total commercial sector loans in the banking system, and for about 50 percent&#13;
of the total loans to households. The developmental objectives of the project will be measured against&#13;
selected development indicators, as explained in Annex 6.&#13;
Participating Banks&#13;
5.    Komerciaalna Banka, the second largest bank in FYR of Macedonia, has been established in 1992,&#13;
from the former Skopje branch of Stopanska Banka. Its capital amounted to US$165 million as of&#13;
December 31, 1995. The bank is now fully private with 11.2 percent of its capital owned by socially-&#13;
owned enterprises, about 56.4 percent owned by private enterprises, and the remainder by mixed&#13;
enterprises with majority private ownership. In terms of numbers, the banks ordinary stock is owned by&#13;
84 socially-owned enterprises, 179 mixed-ownership enterprises and 1,650 private shareholders. The&#13;
preferred stock is owned by 2,737 owners of which 2,663 are private. The total asset as of&#13;
December 31, 1995 amounted to US$419 million, of which about US$85 million is the loan portfolio.&#13;
The net profit before taxation as of end-September 1995 amounted to US$4.5 million. The interest&#13;
expense is about 22 percent of the interest income.&#13;
6.    The bank has experienced a very strong growth since its establishment. It has restructured its&#13;
portfolio over the past five years. In 1990, the bank's credit portfolio showed a 79 percent share for&#13;
manufacturing, 2 percent for agriculture and agroindustry, and 19 percent for other subsectors (trade,&#13;
handicrafts and others). In mid-1995, the portfolio mix showed a significantly different profile, with&#13;
agriculture and agroindustry accounting for 66 percent, manufacturing 27 percent, and other subsectors&#13;
7 percent. Komercijalna Banka has a tradition of extending funding for fixed investments and working&#13;
capital, accounting for 61 percent and 39 percent, respectively, the loan portfolio as of mid-1995. The&#13;
bank reports no export finance activity or loans in foreign currency.&#13;
7.    The bank was fully appraised in July 1995, after it has presented externally audited financial&#13;
statements by Coopers and Lybrand with a clean audit opinion. Its financial condition, assuming there&#13;
is a satisfactory resolution concerning frozen foreign currency deposit payments from bank's own funds&#13;
and the work-outs involving exposures to enterprises under the FESAC program, is fully satisfactory.&#13;
The bank is, therefore, deemed able to qualify as a PFI.&#13;
8.    Makedonska Banka, the third largest bank in FYR of Macedonia, has been established in 1992,&#13;
from the former branch of Ljubljanska Banka from Slovenia. Its total capital as of December 31, 1995&#13;
was US$29 million. Its share holders include Ljubljanska Banka for 51 percent, and the remaining 49&#13;
percent is held by domestic private enterprises and individuals. Ljubljanska Banka has recently&#13;
announced its intention to withdraw its ownership and its shares are now being offered to other investors.&#13;
The total assets as of December 31, 1995, amounted to US$490 million. Its net credit portfolio is&#13;
equivalent to US$43 million, with an orientation toward services (24 percent), manufacturing (20 percent)&#13;
and other subsectors (56 percent). The portfolio currently shows minimal exposure to agriculture and&#13;
agroindustry. The interest expense for the bank is 19.4 percent of interest income. The net profit before&#13;
taxation as of September 30, 1995 was about US$318,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 2&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
9.    The bank's credit portfolio is predominantly short-term in nature, the medium-term to 17 percent&#13;
of the total credit portfolio. The bank's operational emphasis is on export finance and working capital,&#13;
which represent 60 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of total portfolio. The bank has no outstanding&#13;
credits for fixed investments. It has a 44 percent-56 percent mix between foreign currency and local&#13;
currency loans. The loan portfolio is spread over small (57 percent), medium-sized (23 percent) and&#13;
large (20 percent) borrowers. The bank's management reports conservative leverage ratios prescribed&#13;
for borrowers, with average total debt/equity ratios of 1:2 and average long-term debt/equity ratios of&#13;
1:1.5 as of year-end 1994.&#13;
10.   The bank pursues very conservative lending policies. Its potential profitability is the highest in&#13;
the banking sector. The bank is regularly audited by foreign external auditors, and was able to get clean&#13;
audit opinions for 1993 and 1994. It will be appraised as soon as the end-1995 external audit is&#13;
completed. The bank is deemed able to meet the qualification criteria.&#13;
11.   Balkanska Banka is a new bank which is much smaller than Komercijalna Banka and Makedonska&#13;
Banka with the total capital of US$7.43 million as of December 31, 1995. The total assets amount to&#13;
about/US$15 million, and the loan portfolio to US$7.6 million with 55 percent trade, 34 percent&#13;
manufacturing, 4 percent agriculture and agroindustry and 7 percent other subsectors. The bank projects&#13;
a sustained build-up of its portfolio over the medium-term, with a balanced mix between agriculture and&#13;
agroindustry, manufacturing, and trade. The bank's short-term loans represent 97 percent of total credits,&#13;
with 3 percent having a medium-term maturity.&#13;
12.   All of Balkanska Banka's credits are for export finance, with no exposure in investment and&#13;
working capital loans. In mid-1995 portfolio indicated a 48 percent - 52 percent ratio between foreign&#13;
currency and denar loans. The concentration on export finance yielding high interest rates reflects the&#13;
bank's current strategy of financing trade. The borrowers of Balkanska Banka show a much higher&#13;
average leverage position compared to those of Makedonska Banka. Bankers explain the higher leverage&#13;
ratios for borrowers of newer banks as flowing from the observation that newer banks tend to cater to&#13;
new or less established entrepreneurs who generally have modest equity resources. In spite of relatively&#13;
higher risk profile compared to other banks, the level of provision is only about 4.7 percent of its total&#13;
loan portfolio.&#13;
13.   The bank was appraised in July 1995, but its audit report was not satisfactory to the Bank. It was&#13;
asked to provide a new audit which meets the Bank standards before it can be qualified.&#13;
14.   Invest Banka, with the total capital of US$6.9 million and total assets of US$20 million as of&#13;
December 31, 1995, has been in operation since the former Yugoslavia, but it has substantially changed&#13;
its profile since independence. The shareholders of Invest Banka consist of 113 legal entities and 60&#13;
individuals. The highest percentage of shares held by a single entity is 9.73 percent. The Board of&#13;
Directors consist of five members which represent either fully private enterprises (three members-&#13;
including the Chairman of the Board), or enterprises of which at least 70 percent of the ownership is&#13;
private. With the total loan portfolio of about US$6 million, the bank is predominantly oriented on&#13;
banking services and trade financing. Almost 95 percent of its credit operations consist of short-term&#13;
loans with a maturity of up to three months. As of end of 1994, more than 65 percent of its revenues&#13;
consist of income generated in the form of fees and commissions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 2&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
15.   The bank is fairly small, and its business concentrates on off-balance sheet financial services,&#13;
possibly due to funding difficulties. The application for participation is an indication that its management&#13;
intends to position a bank on a higher growth path. The bank was appraised in July 1995, but the final&#13;
opinion was not reached because its capital adequacy is uncertain. The bank does not classify its assets,&#13;
and has no provisions. The appraisal will be finalized when the bank was able to provide a full review&#13;
by external auditors of its credit portfolio.&#13;
16.   Ohridska Banka has been established under the banking sector restructuring program undertaken&#13;
under the FESAC. It has operated as an independent bank in the 1979-1992 period, and was originally&#13;
specialized in the small scale private sector, and households finance and in deposit taking. During the&#13;
1980s it has also developed the capacity for working capital and investment finance in domestic currency&#13;
of larger socially-owned enterprises. In 1992, the bank was integrated with Stopanska Bank, albeit&#13;
keeping independent internal accounts. In order to reduce the market dominance of Stopanska, a decision&#13;
has been made to spin-off its larger branches which are able to operate as independent banks, if their&#13;
shareholders decide to exercise such a option. The Ohrid branch applied, and the NBM granted the&#13;
banking license in March 1995. The bank is currently owned by a large number of small owners and&#13;
about 100 somewhat larger enterprises. The Ohridska assets as of December 31, 1995 amounted to&#13;
US$37 million, making it the fifth largest bank in FYR of Macedonia, with a capital of about US$11&#13;
million. Its loan portfolio totalled about US$6.3 million. It has been originally appraised under the&#13;
FESAC, when assessing its capacity to operate independently. The bank has applied for participation,&#13;
but the formal appraisal is pending: (a) the satisfactory resolution of internal accounts with the ccre&#13;
Stopanska; (b) the resolution of the issue concerning the frozen foreign exchange deposits payments made&#13;
from bank's own funds; and (c) completion of the first external audit by auditors satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
It is expected that the bank will be ready for formal appraisal by May 1996. The bank is expected to be&#13;
able to quality.&#13;
17.   Stopanska Banka. Bitola. The background of the Stopanska Bitola is the same as for Ohridska&#13;
Banka. The NBM license was issued in May 1995. The bank is now the fourth largest bank in FYR of&#13;
Macedonia with assets amounting to about US$58 million as of Decmeber 31, 1995, its capital to about&#13;
US$17.8 million, and the total loans US$18.2 million. It has applied for participation, but has not been&#13;
appraised due to the reasons also cited for Ohridska. The bank is expected to be ready for appraisal by&#13;
May 1996. It is expected to be able to qualify.&#13;
18.   Tetovska Banka. Tetovo. The bank has total assets of US$29 million as of end-1995, and capital&#13;
of US$10.6 million. It has received its license in May 1995. The background of this bank as well as&#13;
its appraisal prospects is the same as for Ohridska and Stopanska Bitola.&#13;
19.   Kreditna Banka, with the capital of US$10.3 million, as of December 31, 1995, is one of the&#13;
new private banks established after independence by a number of independent entrepreneurs and backed&#13;
by a single large foreign private shareholder. The bank's main business since its establishment is the&#13;
provision of off-balance sheet financial services to entrepreneurs and private sector enterprises. The fees&#13;
currently account for about two times the total interest income. Other main line of activity is deposit&#13;
taking; the bank is almost exclusively interested in foreign currency deposits (US$9.1 million). The total&#13;
assets amounted to US$22.4 million as of December 31, 1995, and its loan portfolio is small (US$5.7&#13;
million) and of recent origin. The bank aims to specialize in foreign currency banking activities, and&#13;
would like to become more serious in foreign currency lending. It has recently expressed interest to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

participate in the private sector finance component. Its appraisal will take place as soon as the bank is&#13;
able to present externally audited financial statements with clean audit opinion satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
20.   Almaco Banka, with the total capital of US$11 million as of December 31, 1995, is one of the&#13;
new private banks established after independence with private MKD capital. Its assets totalled US$43.2&#13;
million as of December 31, 1995. The bank has initially focussed on off-balance sheet external trade&#13;
related services. It has changed its business policy in 1994, and is now aggressively trying to expand its&#13;
loan portfolio and specialize as a lender to small private businesses. With loan portfolio of about US$15&#13;
million, it is now the fifth largest competitor in the credit market. Successful realization of its business&#13;
policy critically depends on whether the bank is able to increase and diversify its funding sources. This&#13;
was the reason that the bank applied for participation. Its appraisal is pending completion of its first&#13;
external audit. The bank is expected to be ready for appraisal in May 1996, and it is expected to be able&#13;
to qualify.&#13;

PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Terms of Reference for Operational Audits of Participating Banks&#13;
A.    BACKGROUND&#13;
l.    During the past year, the Government of Macedonia has instituted a number of economic reforms&#13;
aiming to reverse the economic decline. Although some of these measures are expected to yield positive&#13;
results in the short-term, their potential benefits in the medium- to long-term cannot be realized without&#13;
a strong and active financial system. At present FYR of Macedonia banking institutions still suffer from&#13;
distortions inherited from past policies and practices, in particular, a lack of autonomy, a general lack&#13;
of banking skills necessary in a market environment, and an inadequate financial structure. As one of&#13;
the initial steps for strengthening the financial sector, the Government has decided to undertake a program&#13;
for the strengthening of existing banks. The Government has also initiated a number of actions aiming&#13;
at strengthening the National Bank of Macedonia including its bank supervisory function, the drafting of&#13;
prudential regulations and the development of a new accounting plan for banks.&#13;
B.    OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.    The Operational Audits are expected to provide an accurate assessment of the financial condition&#13;
and operational capabilities of the audited banks, including the evaluation of their organization, policies&#13;
and procedures. These Operational Audits will serve as a basis for banks' strengthening programs&#13;
including their recapitalization to the level in accordance with sound international banking practice and&#13;
provision of technical assistance to improve their banking practices. The audits will also be used as a&#13;
background for the appraisal process to qualify banks for participation in the World Bank credit lines.&#13;
The audits should cover both financial and organizational aspects.&#13;
The financial aspect of the Operational Audit should cover:&#13;
(a)   the adjustment of the balance sheet as of December 31, of previous year (starting with&#13;
1995), and the related statements of operations for the year then ended to a format based&#13;
on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for banks; and&#13;
(b)   the examination of financial data as specified.&#13;
The organizational aspect of the Operational Audit should cover:&#13;
(a)    assessment of the bank(s) present functioning. including:&#13;
(i)     internal organization;&#13;
(ii)     asset and credit management;&#13;
(iii)    resource mobilization and funding;&#13;

participation in the Private Sector Development Project.&#13;
D.    ADJUSTMENT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
The Financial Aspect of the Operational Audit&#13;
4.    The FYR of Macedonia banks to be audited intend to convert their present accounting system to&#13;
a system based on internationally accepted standards in 1996. However, in 1995, the banks were still&#13;
using the old accounting model. For the year ended December 31, 1995, the auditor has to adjust the&#13;
annual financial statements in such a way as to establish the balance sheet as of December 31, 1995, and&#13;
the related statements of operations, retained earnings and changes in the financial position of the bank,&#13;
for the year ended, in a format which is in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Standards&#13;
for banks.&#13;
5.    Reports to be Provided.  The consolidated annual financial statements, after appropriate&#13;
adjustments, for the year ended December 31, 1995. This should include Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss&#13;
Statement, State of Changes in Shareholders' Equity, Statement of Sources and Application of Funds,&#13;
Statement of Provisions for Losses, Write-offs and Recoverables, and Statement of Past Due, Non-&#13;
performing and Renegotiated Loans and Advances. The accounts should be accompanied by notes,&#13;
explanations and back-up schedules. These working papers will be important for the bank in its&#13;
understanding of the process of international accounting and the adjustments made to the bank's own&#13;
accounts to achieve this.&#13;
E.    PORTFOLIO REVIEW AND DETERMINATION OF PROVISIONS&#13;
6.    To support an overall assessment of the current financial conditions of the credit portfolios and&#13;
projections regarding the extent of ultimate loss potential, detailed portfolio reviews are to be performed.&#13;
The portfolio reviews have to:&#13;
(a)    determine the credit quality of all major borrowers and debtors under loans, investments&#13;
and off-balance sheet commitments;&#13;
(b)    classify all significant loans, investments and off-balance sheet commitments, according&#13;
to established classification criteria based on repayment capacity and collateral; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
- 47                      ~                  Page 3 of9&#13;
(c)    determine the appropriate level of current provisions for all such assets based on&#13;
estimated loss potential.&#13;
7.     In devising the plan of work for the portfolio reviews, the auditors should take into consideration&#13;
the effectiveness and reliability of accounting and administrative systems and internal controls in order&#13;
to determine the degree of reliance to be placed upon them.&#13;
8.     The evaluation of asset quality should identify problems assets and classify them according to&#13;
criteria for substandard, doubtful and loss categories '/. All commercial extensions of credit 2/ exceeding&#13;
the cutoff amount are to be individually reviewed. The cutoff amount is defined as those extensions of&#13;
credit exceeding 0.5% of total assets or a sufficient number to encompass about 70% of the total amount&#13;
of commercial credits. Commercial credits below the cutoff amount are to be reviewed on a sample&#13;
basis. The sample should be of sufficient size to enable statistically valid statements regarding the below-&#13;
cutoff portfolio. Non-commercial extensions of credit (such as consumer loans and residential mortgages)&#13;
are to be reviewed based on a statistical sample of sufficient size to allow a valid audit opinion.&#13;
9.     The review of individual credits must entail an analysis of the obligor's capacity to service interest&#13;
payments at market interest rates based on existing levels of debt, and their capacity to repay principal,&#13;
under existing market conditions. For credits in amounts exceeding 5 % of the bank's equity, the analysis&#13;
requires an assessment of the obligor's business, plans, the potential for success of those plans, and their&#13;
potential consequences on debt service capacity and principal repayment.&#13;
10.    Based on the credit analysis and classification, the auditor should recommend an appropriate level&#13;
of provisions for losses. Estimates should be made for the specific reserves appropriate for each credit&#13;
reviewed. The analysis upon which these estimates are based should be included in the supporting&#13;
documentation.&#13;
11.    Reports to be Provided. At a minimum, the final report of the portfolio review should include&#13;
the following information. However, the auditor is encouraged to submit additional information relevant&#13;
to his findings which will serve to inform and educate the reader. All specified reports are due for the&#13;
December 31, 1995 audit.&#13;
(a)    A description of the lending authorities, a flow chart of the credit approval process, and&#13;
other information considered necessary to provide an understanding of the bank's credit,&#13;
appraisal and supervision process and lending activities.&#13;
(b)    A written assessment of lending activities based on your findings. This assessment&#13;
should address the following: (i) the quality of assets and its impact upon the soundness&#13;
of the institution; (ii) the quality of management with respect to the lending and&#13;
investment functions; (iii) the quality and effectiveness of loan and investment policies,&#13;
practices, procedures and internal controls; (iv) concentrations of credit; (v) loan pricing&#13;
policies; (vi) other matters of importance requiring attention such as foreign exchange,&#13;
1/     Definitions for these categories should follow internationaL standards.&#13;

administration of the loan and investment portfolios.&#13;
(c)    A statement describing the method by which the required classification criteria were&#13;
applied in the FYR of Macedonia context, including any unusual factors that served to&#13;
influence the classifications assigned, should be provided.&#13;
(d)    A summary schedule of the number and volume of credits reviewed individually and by&#13;
sample, expressed in nominal terms and as a percent of one and off-balance sheet credits&#13;

equivalent of 5 % of bank's equity. These written comments should provide a breakdown&#13;
of total extensions of credit to the enterprise and its related entities, indicating the amount&#13;
classified; a description of the credit including the history of the indebtedness, the&#13;
repayment plan and actual performance; a description of the collateral and/or guarantees&#13;
(if any); and the reasons for the chosen classification for the credit.&#13;
(g)    A summary statement of all past due, non-performing, and renegotiated credits, by&#13;
category or type of credit expressed: (i) in domestic currency; and (ii) as a percentage&#13;
of total outstanding credits in that category. The criteria to be used to determine past&#13;
due, non-performing, or renegotiated status should be clearly stated.&#13;
(h)    A listing of large 3/ past due, non-performing, and renegotiated loans. You should&#13;
indicate the name of the borrower, the amount outstanding, the number of days payments&#13;
are in arrears (if appropriate), and any other pertinent information.&#13;
(i)    A listing of loans not supported by current and satisfactory financial information or&#13;
lacking a satisfactory definition of the loan's purpose and repayment plan. The listing&#13;
should include the name of the borrower, the outstanding balance of the loan, and the&#13;
nature of the credit file exception.&#13;
(j)    A listing of loans not supported by complete collateral documentation. The listing should&#13;
include the name of the borrower, the outstanding balance of the loan, and the nature of&#13;
the collateral exception. This listing should also highlight collateral which is judged to&#13;
be worth less than its stated value, e.g. inventories of finished goods no longer saleable&#13;
in the new market economy.&#13;
12.    To the extent that other auditors are involved in the portfolio reviews of other FYR of Macedonia&#13;
financial institutions, you are required to coordinate your activities and agree upon standards, with NBM&#13;
consent, to be used in evaluating the quality of assets and in assessing the adequacy of services. In this&#13;
regard, it may be necessary to agree on common interpretations of the standard classification definitions&#13;
for the FYR of Macedonia context. For the purpose of credit classification, you should also agree on&#13;
3/     GeneraLLy, these wouLd include Loans which exceed to cut-off amount.&#13;

rescheduled, rolled-over, extended, or otherwise refinanced to hide delinquency.&#13;
F.    EXAMINATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS&#13;
13.   The auditor is required to perform an examination of the consolidated accounts of the bank with&#13;
a view to expressing an opinion on the financial condition of the bank as at December 31, 1995.&#13;
14.   Reports to be Provided. The auditor has to provide reports as follows:&#13;
(a)    The opinion of the auditor on the financial statements.&#13;
(b)    A statement of commitments and contingencies itemizing and quantifying all contingent&#13;
liabilities, to include, inter alia, undrawn loan commitments, guarantees, documentary&#13;
and standby L/C's and forward foreign exchange contracts.&#13;
(c)    A report on all extensions of credit, loans, investments and commitments, consistent with&#13;
the portfolio review, indicating:&#13;
*     Breakdown of items on balance sheet as between local currency and foreign&#13;
currency&#13;
*     Breakdown of items off-balance sheet as between local currency and foreign&#13;
currency&#13;
*     Portion of each subcategory above which is Past Due, Non-Performing or&#13;
Renegotiated&#13;
c     Total of uncollected interest (if this calculation is feasible).&#13;
(d)    An opinion on the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses and all other reserves. In the&#13;
absence of loan loss reserves, recommendations should be made as to specific provisions&#13;
required, consistent with the findings of the portfolio review.&#13;
(e)    An enumeration and quantification of the adjustments considered necessary to fairly&#13;
present the financial statements.&#13;
(f)    The identification and quantification of concentration of credit and large exposures&#13;
defined as representing 25% or more of the bank's capital funds. These concentrations&#13;
may result from credit (in the form of loans, investments, or other instruments) extended&#13;
to a single borrower or related group or to an economic or industrial subsector, or assets&#13;
dependent upon a single factor that could affect repayment prospects for the entire group&#13;
of assets. It is recognized that in the FYR of Macedonia context, a large proportion of&#13;
the banks' portfolios will comprise loans to entities owned by the government and/or&#13;
guaranteed by the government, either explicitly or implicitly. An attempt should be made&#13;
to identify which loans are formally guaranteed by the government and which are covered&#13;
by informal arrangements.&#13;
&#13;

any clarifications considered useful;&#13;
(b)    a description of significant accounting policies, criteria and practices applied by the&#13;
auditors in preparation of the financial statements;&#13;

(d)    a statement of the effects of non-application of any International Accounting standards&#13;
by the auditors;&#13;

connected with the bank; and&#13;
(g)    any significant events affecting the bank which occurred between the account date and&#13;

16.   It is recognized that owing to the precarious state of accounting in FYR of Macedonia, some of&#13;
the requirements under paragraphs 18 and 19 above will present the auditors with a difficult task. In such&#13;
cases the auditors should use their judgement and state clearly which items above cannot be satisfactorily&#13;
answered or addressed in this initial short audit.&#13;
G.    ASSESSMENT OF THE BANK'S PRESENT FUNCTIONING&#13;
The Organizational Aspect of the Operational Audit&#13;
17.   The auditor should analyze the present internal organization and functions of the bank, including&#13;
the internal control and internal auditing function and the quality of management reporting. The auditor&#13;
shall give his opinion on the accuracy and reliability of the present accounting system, and on the&#13;
adequacy of the bank's internal organization, controls and operating procedures. In undertaking the&#13;
analyses of the above mentioned present organizational aspects the auditors are expected to visit both the&#13;
head office of the bank and a number of representative branches and sub-branches.&#13;

Page 7 of 9&#13;
18.   Report to be Provided. The report on the present organization has to cover the following areas:&#13;
(a)    Asset and Credit Management. The auditors should review and comment on the bank's&#13;
objectives, strategy, operations and performance in the area of general asset management&#13;
and in particular credit management. The key results from the portfolio review and short&#13;
audits as at December 31, 1995 to be undertaken concurrently should be analyzed and&#13;
conmmented upon in the light of their strategic importance to the bank (in terms of size,&#13;
effect on earnings, etc.) and the underlying market fundamentals.&#13;
(b)    Treasury and Asset and Liability Management. The auditors should review and comment&#13;
on the bank's objectives, strategy, operations and performance in the areas of treasury,&#13;
and asset and liability management. The key results from the financial analysis of assets&#13;
and liabilities (both on- and off- balance sheet) undertaken in the portfolio review and&#13;
short audits as at December 31, 1995 should be analyzed and commented on in the light&#13;
of their strategic importance to the bank (in terms of size effect on earnings, etc.) and the&#13;
underlying market fundamentals. particular attention should be given to interest rate,&#13;
foreign exchange and maturity mismatches.&#13;
(c)    Resource Mobilization and Funding.  A review of the bank's plan, policies and&#13;
procedures for resource mobilization and funding should be included. The review should&#13;
examine whether the bank has and successfully operates a suitable resource mobilization&#13;
strategy and discuss implications of the current funding policy and structure on its risk&#13;
exposure and future growth perspectives. Recommendations for improvements should&#13;
be made.&#13;
(d)    Management Information System. The auditor should review the existing management&#13;
information system and indicate areas for possible improvements in order to enhance its&#13;
effectiveness as a tool for management.&#13;
(e)   Internal Audit Function. The auditor should review and give an opinion on internal&#13;
controls and procedures, which must be analyzed with a view to determine their&#13;
effectiveness in ensuring that the bank's assets are being safeguarded, transactions have&#13;
been executed in accordance with management's directives, and that transactions have&#13;
been adequately recorded to permit the timely preparation of the organization's financial&#13;
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The study should&#13;
indicate whether the bank has a manual that incorporates sound audit policies and&#13;
practical audit procedures, and whether the level of audit skills needs to be upgraded and&#13;
expanded.&#13;
(f)    Organizational Review. The organizational structure of the bank should be reviewed to&#13;
determine whether it provides for effective and efficient realization of the bank's&#13;
objectives. The audit should take into account and comment on the grouping of main&#13;
functions, delegation of authority, clear definition of responsibilities and the relationship&#13;
of head-office with branch offices.&#13;
(g)    Financial performance and Management. The auditor should review and comment on the&#13;
financial performance of the bank in terms of the profitability of its overall operations,&#13;
its products, branches and departments and its financial strength.&#13;

Page 8 of 9&#13;
(h)    Training. The auditor should review and comment on whether the bank has defined&#13;
specific skill requirements for management, specialist and key clerical positions, assessed&#13;
and prioritized skills shortfalls, and developed practical plans to meet these shortfalls.&#13;
The auditor should recommend a training and other programs for skills enhancement.&#13;
(i)    Automation. The bank's systems of automation should be reviewed in the light of&#13;
requirements, and recommendations should be made as to the needs for improvement.&#13;
H.    BANK'S FUTURE PERFORMANCE&#13;
19.   The auditor should cover the following aspects in assessing the bank's strategic plan:&#13;
(a)    Review of the Bank's Present Strategic Plan. A review should be conducted to determine&#13;
whether the purpose for which the institution was established and the activities originally&#13;
set out in the enabling legislation remain realistic and relevant in the prevailing economic&#13;
environment. The review would determine and discuss if the bank has an adequate&#13;
strategic plan that discusses its objectives, target markets, products and services, the basic&#13;
strategies and actions it needs to take to meet these objectives, and an operational and&#13;
financial plan that projects resource requirements and financial outcomes of the strategic&#13;
plan.&#13;
(b)    Strategic Parameters and Options. From the previous analysis the auditor should review&#13;
and comment on the important strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the&#13;
bank. Based on their conclusions the auditor should examine and discuss the main&#13;
strategic options for the bank with the bank's management and staff and provide a brief&#13;
summary of the discussion.&#13;
(c)    Training. Based on this review and the Strategic Plan Review undertaken as part of this&#13;
assignment a training plan should be developed with the bank's management.&#13;
I.     COUNTERPARTS&#13;
20.   The banks undergoing operational audits will establish counterpart teams to work in close&#13;
collaboration with the auditors assigned to the task. The auditors will be expected to provide the staff&#13;
of the banks with on-the-job training in portfolio assessment, accounting and auditing techniques. The&#13;
objective is to use this initial operational audit at December 31, 1995, as a springboard to establish a&#13;
practice of yearly full audits. This will require an effective skills transfer from the external audit staff&#13;
to the banks' counterpart teams.&#13;
J.     CONFIDENTIALITY&#13;
21.   This exercise is being carried out primarily for the purpose of appraising the financial conditions&#13;
and developing a program for strengthening of the concerned banks. Accordingly, the auditors will&#13;
neither discuss with, nor distribute to parties outside the management of the relevant bank, the Banking&#13;
Supervision Department of the National Bank. of Macedonia and the World Bank, without their explicit&#13;
authorization, any aspects or details of their work ad findings.&#13;
&#13;

Independence and Impartiality&#13;
22.   The consultants must be independent of any member of the Board of Directors, Executive Officer&#13;
or Senior Manager of the bank. Independence implies that the senior managing partner, other partner&#13;
or staff member who would be involved in the portfolio review and short audit, is neither serving as a&#13;
director of the bank nor has any personal, financial or close business relationship except as an&#13;
independent professional advisor during the course of an audit.&#13;
K.    STAFFING&#13;
23.   For carrying out the required tasks, the team must include banking auditors with international&#13;
experience. Given the importance of the task to be undertaken, it is anticipated that the audits would be&#13;
carried out by a reputable firm drawling on high-level staff with international experience and having a&#13;
suitable skills mix. The team would be expected to work with a small counterpart team from the bank&#13;
being audited.&#13;
24.   Curriculum vitae (CVs) of the principals who would be responsible for providing the opinions&#13;
and reports should be provided, together with the CVs of other personnel proposed for the audit. CVs&#13;
for audit personnel should include details on audits carried out by these staff, including ongoing&#13;
assignments.&#13;
25.   It is anticipated that an auditing firm would undertake the analysis of more than one bank, and&#13;
that the whole process could be carried out by about 2-3 auditing firms.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The principal objectives of the Private
            Sector Development Project are to: 1) promote growth of the
            private sector and create conditions for an effective supply
            response from viable private enterprises and farmers; 2)
            facilitate the adoption of safe and sound banking practices;
            and 3) stimulate competition in the credit market. The
            project will provide an opportunity for the Bank to
            follow-up on the level of individual banks with its
            assistance, initiated under the Financial and Enterprise
            Sector Credit, to transformation and strengthening of the
            banking sector. It consists of two main components: 1) a
            private sector finance component which will provide
            investment and permanent working capital loans to private
            enterprises, including agricultural enterprises in order to
            improve profitability by increasing output or improving
            efficiency; and 2) a private farmer finance component which
            will help viable private farmers expand their agricultural output.
