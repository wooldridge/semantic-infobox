                                        PART 1-THE CONFLICT&#13;
&#13;
A.       The end of the conflict&#13;
&#13;
1,       The prospects for lastingpeaceinAngola are now better than they have been for decades. In&#13;
April 2002 the representatives ofthe govemment andofUni2oNacional para IndependhciaTotalde&#13;
Angola (UNITA) signed a ceasefire and peaceagreement. Incontrast to agreements signed in 1991and&#13;
1994, this agreement has beenrespected. UNITAhas officially ceasedto be a rebelmovement and has&#13;
transformed itself into a legalpoliticalparty inanticipationo fthe elections that are plannedfor 2005 or&#13;
2006.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Angola remains as a resourcerich, butpolicy poor Low Income Country Under Stress(LICUS).&#13;
Nevertheless, since the signingo fthe peaceagreement on April 4,2002, there has been steady progress in&#13;
several areas inthe country. Political stability i s established throughout the country and the Govemment&#13;
i s recognizedby all parties and has remained cohesive and functioning since the ceasefire agreement. The&#13;
reconciliation process canbe considered to a large extent homegrown, with limitedparticipationo f&#13;
extemal mediators. UNITAparliamentarians are fully integrated into the National Assembly and the&#13;
President o f the Republic has announcedpresidential elections for 2006. There have beenno major&#13;
changes inthe cabinet since 2002 and the Govemment has beeninclose contact withthe World Bank and&#13;
the IMF on issues related to public financial management and fiscal discipline overall. The economy has&#13;
benefited from higher international oil prices andthe prospect i s that oil production will double over the&#13;
nexttwo years, reachingsome 2 millionbarrelsper day by early 2007. The favorable economic outlook&#13;
has also attracted a significant volume o f Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Inaddition, several measures&#13;
have beentaken since 2002 to address public finance management issues and some positive results are&#13;
beginningto materialize. The Govemment has also concluded its PRSP (Estrategia de Combate A&#13;
Pobreza, ECP), which establishespriorities for public spending on social strategic areas. The estimated&#13;
costs o f the strategy have been incorporated into the 2005 budget and there are already ongoing&#13;
interventions for targeted vulnerable groups.&#13;
&#13;
3,       The level and quality o f dialogue with the Bretton Woods Institutions (BWJJhas improved&#13;
considerably. The President o f the Republic visited the World Bank and the IMF inMay 2004 and asked&#13;
for support from both institutions to help Angola consolidate macroeconomic stabilization andmeet its&#13;
reconstructionchallenges after a 27-year long civil war that ended in2002. With greater and more explicit&#13;
political commitment, the relationshipbetweenthe Angolan Govemment and the BWIshas improved&#13;
substantially since the two short-lived SMPs o f2000 and 2001, which went off-track inboth&#13;
macroeconomic and structural areas. Joint missions bythe Bank and the Fundvisited Angola inFebruary&#13;
and July o f 2004 and there hasbeen effective cooperation from the authorities indisclosing all the&#13;
required information. A Staff MonitoredProgram(SMP) i s expected to be agreedon by end-2004 with&#13;
the aim o f supporting the sustainability of the country's macroeconomic stabilization. The Bank has also&#13;
discussedwith the authorities a Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review&#13;
(PEMFAR) which is guidingan important sector o fthe policy dialogue inthe context o f the SMP&#13;
negotiations. Some of the measuresrecommended inthe Bank's PEMFAR are already being implemented&#13;
bythe authorities, as for example those relatedto the management ofthe fiscal accounts, the extemal&#13;
debt, andthe quasi-fiscal operations performed by the state oil company (Sonangol).&#13;
&#13;
4.       Significant progress has been made towards macroeconomic stabilization over the last year.&#13;
Major achievements include: a decline inthe 2-month rate o f inflation to below 27% in September 2004&#13;
from levels persistentlyinexcess of 100%inprevious years; a downward trend inthe fiscal deficit,&#13;
benefiting recently from higher oil prices; a decline inthe non-oil fiscal deficit; positive real interest rates&#13;
for govemment debt; a decline inmoney supply growth (M3) to a 15% levelinJuly 2004 compared to a&#13;
40% growth rate inJuly 2003, and a considerable deceleration inthe rate o f depreciation o fthe kwanza&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
exchange rate. There has also been a consistent improvement inthe current account balance since 2000&#13;
mirroring growing oil export values. The strategy usedto defend the kwanza, however, based on central&#13;
bank sales o f foreign exchange, has kept the level of foreign exchangereserveslow, they are only&#13;
sufficient to cover for 1montho f imports.&#13;
&#13;
B.       Economic and social impact of the conflict&#13;
&#13;
5.       Angola's nearly 30 years of civil conflict have had devastating effects on the country's economy,&#13;
infrastructure, and citizen's quality o flife. While accurate data are lacking, it is estimated that over 1&#13;
million people may have beenkilled since the armed conflict beganbetween rival groups following&#13;
independence in 1975. The conflict also displaced about 4 million people, about one-third o fthe&#13;
country's 13 millioncitizens (UNestimates as o fApril 2003). About 100,000 o f these are&#13;
unaccompanied children. Most o fthe displaced fledto Luanda, Lobito, and other coastal cities. They&#13;
live insqualid conditions inovercrowded urban and semi-urban areas without functioning healthand&#13;
water and sanitation infrastructure and without adequate social services. The potential for epidemics i s&#13;
high. Itis also likelythat the number ofpeople infectedbyHIV/AIDSisrisingrapidlydue to the&#13;
movement o fpeople and lack o fHIV/AIDS awareness. The situationi s becoming even more complex as&#13;
millions o f intemally displaced people are nowreturningto their provinces o f origin, and many resident&#13;
communities, themselves severely affected by the war, are strugglingto cope withthe suddeninflux of&#13;
returnees.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Although available data indicatethat urbanpoverty has worsened inrecent years due to a large&#13;
extent to the influxo f migrants from rural areas fleeing insecurity, poverty is still deeper and more&#13;
widespread inrural areas. Inmany areas, the recent drought and the limited availability o f seeds,&#13;
fertilizers and other agricultural inputshave combined to createwidespread food shortages. Many people&#13;
inthe worst affectedprovinces are still suffering from severemalnutrition and famine. Healthservices&#13;
are nonexistent or inaccessible for the great majority o frural dwellers. Conflict has destroyed water and&#13;
sanitation systems throughout the country. Encouragingly, inareas that havebeen opened up to road&#13;
traffic as security improves, livingconditions appearto be gettingbetter as humanitarianaidreaches&#13;
previously isolatedcommunities and food becomesmore available.&#13;
&#13;
7.       Nearlythree decadeso f conflict have left the nation's infrastructure inshambles. The majorityof&#13;
roads and airstrips are impassable or insecure. Moreover, some 5-7 millionlandmines situated&#13;
throughout the nation limitmovement and threaten the lives and welfare o f Angolans. The most affected&#13;
provinces include BiC, Huambo, Moxico, Lunda NorteandLunda Sul, Uige, Cuando Cubango, and&#13;
Malanje.&#13;
&#13;
Poverty and social indicators&#13;
&#13;
8.       Angola ranks 166thout o f 177 countries on UNDP's HumanDevelopment Index (HDI) for 2004,&#13;
and attainingthe Millennium Development Goals i s a distant dream. Per capita income totaled about&#13;
US$710 peryear in2002.' Over two-thirds o f Angolans live on lessthan US$2 per day. Nearlyone in&#13;
four Angolans i s extremelypoor, survivingon less than US$0.75 a day. Angola's economy needs to&#13;
grow by about 7.3 percent a year just to keep the number o fpoor from increasing.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Angola's social indicators are among the worst inthe world. Atjust 40.1 years, Angola also has&#13;
one of the lowest life expectancies inthe world. Malnutrition i s acute; about 45 percent of children under&#13;
age 5 suffer from stunting(low height-for-age) and 31percent are underweight. The under-five mortality&#13;
rate, estimated at 260 per 1,000 live births inthe 2002 multiple indicator survey and the infantmortality&#13;
rate at 150per 1,000 live births(compared with 91 for Sub-SaharanAfr-ica as a whole) place Angola at&#13;
the bottomofthe worldrankings. The maternalmortalityrate in2000 o f 1,700 maternaldeathsper&#13;
100,000 live births is also extremely high. Primary school enrollment i s among the lowest inAfrica; in&#13;
the regions most affected bythe war just 25 percent o f children are enrolled inprimary school. Only 27&#13;
'   Calculatedusingthe World BankAtlas method.&#13;
                                                      2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
percent o f students who enter grade one complete grade four. The limited access to education has lef?70&#13;
percent o f adult men and 80 percent o f women unable to read, write, or performbasic computations.&#13;
&#13;
Macroeconomic conditions&#13;
&#13;
10.      Angola has struggledfor years with an unstable macro-economy. A successiono f failed or only&#13;
partially successful stabilizationplans characterized Angola's policy history since its first major attempts&#13;
to stabilize in 1987. Since 1987, the government has pursued a series o f programs to move from the&#13;
command economy introducedat independenceto a more market-based structure, butprogress has been&#13;
slow (inflation briefly reached 12,000 percent in 1996). During2001-03, inflationaveraged 100percent&#13;
which, while a marked improvement over performance of the 1990s, i s still highby international&#13;
standards. Renewed efforts by the government since 2003 have brought the rate o f inflationdown to&#13;
below 50 percent, and inflationis expected to is expected to average 3 0 4 0 percent for 2004. However,&#13;
external debt levels continue to rise indollar terms, internationalreservesare low, andthe potential cost&#13;
competitiveness ofAngola's goods has fallen. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by about 3%percent&#13;
in2003, somewhat better than the populationgrowthrate of3 percent. Withhigheroilproduction and&#13;
prices, the rate o f GDP growthin2004 may increaseto over 10 percent.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Angola's immense oil wealth has not contributed to sound macroeconomic management. While&#13;
the oil revenues give rise to abalance o ftrade surplus, repatriation o frevenues by foreign oil companies&#13;
operating inAngola and other transfer payments result ina significant current account deficit (-15 percent&#13;
o f GDP in2001, estimated -5.8 percent o f GDP in2002). Similarlyinthe fiscal domain, while oil&#13;
provides the bulk (80 percent) ofa relatively highlevel o fnational revenues (an estimated 39 percent&#13;
GDP in2002), even non-interest expenditure i s muchhigher. Wheninterest on accumulated debt is&#13;
added, the overall fiscal deficit i s over 10percent o fGDP (an estimated -9 percent o f GDP in2002). The&#13;
authorities are inthe difficult position o fneeding to substantially increaserecurrent expenditure for&#13;
education, health, and poverty reduction programs, increase capital expenditure, and simultaneously&#13;
reduce the overall budget deficit. Unless and untilfiscal balance i s restored, the underlying inflationary&#13;
momentum inthe economy will continue, undermining attempts to raise national savings and investment&#13;
and achieve higher levels of economic growth and standards o f living.&#13;
&#13;
12.      The authorities are now fully committedto improvingtheir management o fthe economy. They&#13;
have recently intensifiedtheir dialogue withthe IMF, initiatingdiscussions inJuly 2004 on a new staff&#13;
monitoredprogram. They are also increasingly acknowledgingpublicly the problems with&#13;
macroeconomic management and transparency that have slowed growth. Important inroads have been&#13;
made ingranting public accessto sensitive reports and information, notably through publication o fthe Oil&#13;
Diagnostic Study and the sharing with partners, including the Bank, o f the auditedaccounts o f Sonangol&#13;
(the state oil company) and o fthe central bank. Progress has also beenmade to address the issues o f&#13;
quasi-fiscal and extra-budgetary spending. Nevertheless, muchmore needsto be madeto improve public&#13;
financial management systems and practices, as laidout inthe Public ExpenditureManagement and&#13;
Financial Accountability Review. It is expected that the authorities will move decisively to implement&#13;
the financial management actionplanto substantially improve financial management ofpublicresources.&#13;
&#13;
Rural development, health services, and education&#13;
&#13;
13.      Agriculturefaces many challenges. Although Angola has substantial potential to develop a&#13;
diverse agricultural economy, the lack of roads and other transportation infrastructure, displacement o f&#13;
farmers and loss o flivestock, and collapse o f commercial agriculture andrural marketing have prevented&#13;
this potential from beingrealized. Agriculture, forestry, and fishingin2001contributedlessthan 8&#13;
percent o f GDP. Froma net exporter of food before independence, the country inrecent years has&#13;
producedlessthan halfits food requirements, depending on humanitarian aid and commercial imports for&#13;
the remainder. Angola produces only 20-30 percent o f its annual demand for seeds and planting&#13;
materials, and imports are able to fillonly an additional 20 percent o f demand. Producingand&#13;
multiplyingseedsadaptedto the agro-climatic conditions o fthe country is criticalto enable the 60 percent&#13;
of Angolans who depend on agriculture for food and income to restart their production. Other more&#13;
                                                        3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
comprehensive services will have to be developed for the next stages o fthe country rehabilitationand&#13;
development to foster a sustainablereduction inruralpoverty.&#13;
&#13;
14.      Health, The healthconditions inthe country are dismal. Angola's population i s burdenedby&#13;
nutritionaldeficiencies and infectious and parasitic diseases. Malaria, respiratory infections, diarrhea&#13;
diseases, measles, and cholera are the maincauses o f illness and death. Sleeping sicknesshasreemerged&#13;
as a major killer inthe northwest. Reliable data on HIV/AIDS inAngola are lacking. However, proxy&#13;
measuresindicate that the epidemic is well established and that it has already reached the explosive phase&#13;
inLuandaand some other areas. The government isparticularly concernedwiththe highinfantmortality&#13;
and the rising maternalmortality rate. The maincauses o f death for women are malaria, hemorrhage,&#13;
eclampsia, and complications o fabortion andprolongedlabor. These causes are commonly associatedto&#13;
poverty and to the lack o f access to adequatereproductive health services.&#13;
&#13;
15.      Less than 35 percent o fthe population has access to a hnctioning healthfacility located within&#13;
five kilometers from their home. Many public health centerslack equipmentfor diagnosis and treatment&#13;
and transport and communications, essential drugs, andbasic supplies. Healthproviders are often poorly&#13;
trained, nor are incentives inplace to reward good performance. The Ministry o fHealthaims to upgrade&#13;
the skills o fhealthproviders and to correct the imbalance inthe geographical distribution o fhealth&#13;
workers.&#13;
&#13;
16.      Education. Angola spends a smaller percentageo fpublic resourceson education than any other&#13;
country o f Sub-SaharanAfhca (only 7 percent o fthe total public budget comparedto an average o f 17&#13;
percent inSub-SaharanAfrica), although about 59 percent o fthe total populationi s below 25 years o f&#13;
age. Access to education at all levels o fthe system i s severely constrained and educational quality i s very&#13;
poor. As a result, Angola has one o fthe lowest rates o f literacy inSub-SaharanAfrica. Only 30 percent&#13;
of the populationcan read and write and only 20 percent o f women can.&#13;
&#13;
17.      Access to education. Angola's primary school gross enrollment rate is 54 percent (about 1.1&#13;
million students ingrades 1-4 and 213,000 ingrades 5      - 6).'Inprovincesmostaffectedbythe war the&#13;
gross enrollment rate barely reaches 30 percent. About 1.2 million school-age children have never been&#13;
to school, equivalent to 25 percent o f the population aged 5 - 18 years. The school pyramidi s wide at the&#13;
bottomandnarrow at the top. While grades 1     - 4 account  for 75 percent o f student enrollment, higher&#13;
education accounts for less than 1percent.&#13;
&#13;
18.      Quality of education. The quality o f education is poor. About 50 percent o f schools offer three&#13;
shifts per day, which limitstime inthe classroom to a mere three hours per day. The percentage o f&#13;
teacherswith either partial or no qualifications ranges from 50 to 100 percent insome schools.&#13;
Pedagogical and in-service support for unqualified teachers i s limitedor nonexistent and classroom&#13;
teaching and learningmaterials are rarely available inschools. Finally, most primary schools buildings&#13;
are inpoor condition. Insome provinces school buildingswere completely destroyed, while inothers the&#13;
absence o fpublic investment left them severely dilapidated. Most schools lack basic classroom furniture.&#13;
&#13;
19.      InAugust2001, thegovernment developeda 15-yearplanto improvethe educationsystem&#13;
(Estratkgia Integrada para a Melhoria do Sistema de Educacao, 2001-2015). The planproposes to&#13;
increase access and improve the quality o f education at all levels, inthree distinct phases: (a) an&#13;
emergency phase oftwo years, (b) a stabilization phase o f four years, and (c) a system expansion and&#13;
development phaseof nine years. Duringthe first phase, the government places particular emphasis on&#13;
revivingbasic education inthe areas most affected by the civil war, whichare the ones with the lowest&#13;
educational attainment.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Transportation infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
20.      Roads. The war and neglect have taken their toll on the roadnetwork. It i s estimated that some&#13;
80 percent o fthe roadnetwork i s invery badcondition. Inmany places the network i s completely&#13;
interrupted. The end o f civil war has openedthe way for a large increase inroad transport, and about 50&#13;
percent o f the primary roadnetwork has been reopenedto traffic accordingto government estimates. A&#13;
relatively large fleet o fvehicles (mainly trucks) ownedbybothprivate and public transport firms provide&#13;
services. Rates for road transport are very highby internationalstandards, and are only slightly less than&#13;
those for air transport.&#13;
&#13;
21.      Air transportation. Since 1975, air transport has providedthe only reliable mode o f transport&#13;
withinAngola. Besides the state-owned carrier Transportadora ACrea Angolana (TUG), whichhas a&#13;
monopoly for regular scheduled flights withinAngola, some 25 other operators provide servicesbetween&#13;
18 provincial airports and numerous municipal and private airfields inthe country. Flightsafety i s&#13;
substandard, and sometimes precarious, becauseo fthe bad condition o fmany runways, the poor&#13;
condition or absence o fnavigationand communications equipment at many airports, and inadequate&#13;
aircraft maintenance. Angola's air transport authority does not have sufficient resources and capacity to&#13;
fully and effectively carry out its functions.&#13;
&#13;
22.      Rail. Angola's three railway lines connected Angola's three major ports to the interior. All these&#13;
routes are now closed apart from a few short-haul services near the ports. Destroyed bridges, damage&#13;
from the war, and neglect has left large portions o f the network impassable. The government committed&#13;
about US$lOO million from its own resourcesto reopenparts o f the three main rail lines. Three operators&#13;
are currently carrying out limitedworks to expand the useable track.&#13;
&#13;
23.      Ports. Angola's three general cargo ports (Luanda, Lobito, Namibe) continuedto function&#13;
normally throughout the war. The Malongo oil terminal inCabinda serves as an important port for the oil&#13;
industry. Port traffic fell sharply following independence,but dueto transport o foil, has substantially&#13;
recovered.&#13;
&#13;
Other infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
24.      Electricity services. The electricity supply system inAngola has deteriorated during the last 30&#13;
years. The mainhydroelectric plants andtransmission lines of the systemwere builtduringthe 1970s,&#13;
and important parts o f the system are out o f service due to war damage and lack o f investment and&#13;
maintenance. Some areas previously served are today without electricity services. Inthe areas that still&#13;
have electricity, includingLuanda, power failures and loadshedding are frequent, and firms and&#13;
households that can affordto rely heavily on small-scale diesel generators. The electricity supply systems&#13;
inAngola consist ofthree separateintegrated systemsand severalisolatedsmaller systems. The northern&#13;
interconnected system covers Luanda and the most populatedcities o f Bengo, Malanje, KwanzaNorte&#13;
and Kwanza Sul provinces. The central interconnected system covers the populatedcenters o f Benguela&#13;
and Huambo provinces. The southern interconnected system covers the populatedcenters o fHuila and&#13;
Namibe provinces.&#13;
&#13;
25.      Water and sanitation services in Luanda. Only about 38 percent ofAngolans have access to safe&#13;
water, (well belowthe 55 percent average for Sub-SaharanAhca), and 44 percent have access to&#13;
adequatesanitation service^.^ Empresa de Agua da Provincia de Luanda (EPAL), the water utilityserving&#13;
Luandacovers only 30 percent o f the metropolitanpopulation. The remainder rely on untreated river&#13;
water brought into the capital by tanker, paying prices per cubic meter 50 times the pricepaidby those&#13;
connected to EPAL's network (the average tariff o f EPAL i s US$0.20 per cubic meter). A combined&#13;
pluvial and sewage collection systembuilt during the colonial times serves Luanda's urban core, and&#13;
discharges directly into the Luanda bay. Elsewhere sewage is disposed o f inseptic tanks, leaching pits, or&#13;
&#13;
    World DevelopmentIndicatorsdatabase.&#13;
                                                       5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
directly into the streets and gutters o f the city. As water consumption rises, the pressure on the sewerage&#13;
system will increase commensurately.&#13;
&#13;
26.      Water and sanitation sewices outside of Luanda. Water and sanitation systems have totally&#13;
collapsed inthe areas most affected by the war, includingMalanje, Kwito, and N'Dalatando, where most&#13;
households are served by either their own wells or by high-priced water tanker. Eveninurban areas that&#13;
escapeddirect war damage, a lack o f investment and maintenance inwater supply limitsservices to a&#13;
small proportion o fthe population. Inprovincial cities the water utilities serve only about 30 percent o f&#13;
the population. About 61percent ofthe urbanpopulationhasaccessto some sanitation service, with 18&#13;
percent connected to a sewer and the remainder relying on septic tanks, latrines, and leachingpits. Only&#13;
four provincialcapitals-Huambo,       Lubango, Lobito and Benguela-have sanitary sewers. Only two,&#13;
Lobito and Benguela which have benefitedfrom a World Bank-supported project completedin2000,&#13;
have the capacity to treat sewage. According the WHO-UNICEF only 40 percent o frural inhabitants in&#13;
Angola have access to safe water and 30 percent have accessto improved sanitation. Currently, the&#13;
national directorate o f water estimatesthat 3,300 water supplypoints have been installed inthe rural&#13;
areas, but many o fthem are inoperative due to lack o f maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
27.      Urban streets and drainage. Lack o f maintenance, and problems with drainage and erosion have&#13;
underminedmany urban streets, leaving pavements inthe main urbancentersina state o f virtual collapse.&#13;
Lack o fproper drainage also contributes to landslides, which threaten life and damageproperty.&#13;
&#13;
C.       Strategy of the government&#13;
&#13;
28.      The government's overriding objectives for the next four years are to consolidate peace, enhance&#13;
national reconciliation and improve security by extending state administrationto all areas o f the country;&#13;
bringrapidimprovements infood security and livingconditions for the most vulnerable andmost war-&#13;
affected groups, especially those sufferingfrom malnutritionand disease; create safe and hospitable&#13;
conditions for the retum o f displaced people to their regions o f origin; and start rebuilding social services,&#13;
These objectives will be achievedby deliveringbasic social services to both urbanand rural dwellers;&#13;
improvingtransportation infrastructure to facilitate the free movement o fpeople and goods; and adopting&#13;
measuresto stimulate the rural economy, such as improvingthe climate for investment inagriculture,&#13;
mining, andrural industries.&#13;
&#13;
29.      The delivery o f servicesrequires an appropriate transport and logistics strategy and investment,&#13;
supported by an urgentdeminingaction plan devised inconjunction withthe planning o f social services.&#13;
The government recognizes that providingadequate social services will take time. Itplans to follow a&#13;
gradual and phased approach to providing services, focusing first on meetingthe most urgent needs o f the&#13;
population with minimally-acceptable levels of service, while starting the rehabilitationo f infrastructure&#13;
that will allow the provision o f higher levels o f service over time.&#13;
&#13;
30.      Thepoverty reduction strategy. The government with the assistanceo fUNDP and the Bank is in&#13;
the process o f finalizing its poverty reduction strategy (Estrattgia de Combate a Pobreza ECP). About&#13;
US$3.2 billion i s required to fully fundthe program. The government is already implementingmany&#13;
priority activities specified inthe ECP usingits own resources. Once the consultations with donors are&#13;
completedand the ECP, inits final version, is approved by the cabinet, the government intends to submit&#13;
the ECP to a donor conference for support now planned for September 2005.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
31.       Therehabilitation and reconstruction program and itspriority stage. Neglect, mismanagement,&#13;
and damage from the war have ledto the near collapse o f critical infrastructure and capacity o f&#13;
government to deliver basic services or carry out government functions. The rehabilitation and&#13;
reconstructionprogram comprises two overlapping stages. The first stage, called the priority stage&#13;
(PPMW), i s beingimplementedduring 2003-08, and covers about 70 percent o f the costs identifiedin&#13;
the ECP.&#13;
&#13;
32.      The overall purpose of the PPMRRP is to consolidate peace and reestablish state administration&#13;
throughout the country, and to initiate the mediumand long-termprocess o freconstructionand economic&#13;
rehabilitation. The specific objectives are (a) to address the immediate needs o f the poorest people and&#13;
displaced population(includingfacilitating the returnandresettlement o f an estimated 3 million people&#13;
who are voluntarily returning to their regions of origin); (b) to rapidly improve the quality o f life o f&#13;
people living inbothrural and urban areas by expanding accessto vitalpublic services; (c) to reestablish&#13;
critical transportation linksthroughout the country and, inparticular, to reconnect the provinces most&#13;
affectedbythe war-BiC,      Huambo, Moxico, LundaNorte and Lunda Sul, Uige, Cuando Cubango and&#13;
Malanje-to    the rest o fthe country; (d) to enhance food security and start to revive the ruraleconomy,&#13;
especially inthe provinces most affectedbywar; and (e) to strengthen capacity o f government at all&#13;
levels to formulate, prepare, implement, and manage mediumand long-term development programs.&#13;
&#13;
D.       Responseofthe internationalcommunity&#13;
&#13;
33.      Duringmost ofthe years ofcivil conflict, development partners limitedtheir assistanceto Angola&#13;
to humanitarian aid and support for basic education, health, and water and sanitation services, efforts to&#13;
combat HIV/AIDS, smallholder agriculture, demining, and activities such as improving economic&#13;
management and promoting good governance and democracy. Donors increased their support following&#13;
the signingo f the Lusaka protocol in 1994, but scaledback when the peace agreement failed to hold.&#13;
Since the signingo f the peace agreement in2002, development partners have resumed their support for&#13;
economic recovery and development o f Angola. UnitedNations agencies are helpingthe government&#13;
with a variety ofprograms designed to create conditions for lastingpeace, includingprograms to clear&#13;
mines, resettle war-displaced persons, andreintegrate ex-combatants into civilian life. They are also&#13;
providing assistancefor health, nutrition, agriculture, education, andtraining. The African Development&#13;
Bank, following the clearance o f arrears in2001, is supporting basic education, health, agriculture,&#13;
fisheries, and basic infrastructure. The European Commission is focusing on activities to further the&#13;
peaceprocess, to promote good governance and development o f civil society, and to improve delivery o f&#13;
social services and food security. Bilateraldonors, includingthe United States, Spain, Italy, Portugal,&#13;
                                                       7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
France, Sweden, Norway, the UnitedKingdom, and the Netherlands are supporting health and nutrition&#13;
services, agriculture, provision of safe drinkmgwater supplies, demining, strengthening o f&#13;
macroeconomic management and statistical systems. Bilateral aidi s still modest and channeled primarily&#13;
outside o f government structures.&#13;
&#13;
PART 2 -BANK RESPONSEAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
A.        Reengaging with the Republic of Angola&#13;
&#13;
34.       Duringthe 1990sthe Bankapprovedelevenprojects for Angola, all insupport ofpeaceinitiatives&#13;
that ultimately disintegrated. Inmid-1999 the Bank scaledback its assistanceprogramto Angola in&#13;
responseto unstable economic conditions, the resumption o f fighting, a shrinkingportfolio, and poor&#13;
prospects for new lending. Angola is currently a pilot country under the Low-Income Countries Under&#13;
Stress (LICUS) initiative. Support inthe context o fthe initiative i s aimed at increasing the transparency&#13;
o fnaturalresource revenue management, improvingservice delivery, and strengthening capacity for&#13;
public financial management, statistics, and procurement. The Bank approved one project in2000, the&#13;
Second Social Action Fund, which is rated satisfactory.&#13;
&#13;
35.       The Bank started to reengage inAngola with the signingo fthe 2002 peace accords. Itpresented&#13;
its Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) for Angola inMarch2003, covering 15 months untilJune 2004.&#13;
The TSS is designed to support Angola's complex transition from a war-torn society to a stable,&#13;
democratic, prosperous state. Technical assistanceto the government to helpprepare the PPMRPP was&#13;
part o f the TSS. Implementation o f the TSS hasproceeded with slight delays, withthree projects&#13;
approved in2003 (Economic Management Technical Assistance Project, Emergency Demobilization and&#13;
ReintegrationProject, and Third Social Action Fund). The HIVIAIDS, Malaria, and Sexually&#13;
Transmitted Infections, and Tuberculosis Project (HAMSET) is expectedto be approved inDecember&#13;
2004.&#13;
&#13;
B.        Rationale for Bank involvement&#13;
&#13;
36.       Angola, with vast petroleum, mineral, and other natural resources, could potentially be one o f&#13;
Africa's richest countries. Insteadweak policies, institutions, and governance and a lack o f capacity or&#13;
inclination to use finance effectively to reduce poverty have made it one o f Africa's poorest. Inaddition,&#13;
its civil conflict and its role inthe conflicts of its neighbors have contributed to instability inthe entire&#13;
region.&#13;
&#13;
37.       The peace agreement offers Angola an opportunity to rebuild its shatteredeconomy and to&#13;
establish a stable, democratic, andjust society. The World Bank Group will play a critical role inhelping&#13;
Angola to recover and develop byproviding substantial financial resources for rehabilitationand delivery&#13;
o f social services. Perhapsmore importantly, it will also help buildcapacity o fboththe government and&#13;
nongovernmental organizations; support efforts to establish the policy, legal andregulatory frameworks&#13;
that promote good governance and economic growth; and formulate the economic and sector strategies&#13;
for amedium and long-term development program. No other institution has the resources, know-how and&#13;
experience that the Bankhas to prepare, implement,and supervise such a large, complex project as the&#13;
proposed Emergency Multisector Recovery Program (EMRP). The extensive experience o fthe Bank in&#13;
post-conflict countries, inemergency multisector reconstructionprograms and inAngola itselfon&#13;
community driven development andreintegration o f ex-combatants insociety will be drawn upon. Bank&#13;
involvement will also help guarantee a focus on reducingpoverty.&#13;
&#13;
38.       Bank involvement will also help inmobilizingresources from other donors and incoordinating&#13;
various inputs and contributions. Coordination is essential to ensure coherence o f the overall priority&#13;
reconstruction program and the smooth implementation o f the project. This i s consistent with the&#13;
expected Bank role and its value added within the LICUS approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
C.      Bank strategy&#13;
&#13;
39.     The proposed program will support a carefully sequenced set o f activities that can be completed&#13;
within a relatively short period and that will lay the foundation for future support. The programwill&#13;
focus support insix o f Angola's most war-affected provinces, as agreed between the Bank and the&#13;
government. These are BIC, MOX'ICO,      Kwanza Norte, Luanda, Uige and Malanje (Map 1). Appendix I1&#13;
provides profiles for five o f the selected Provinces. Inaddition to being among those most affected by the&#13;
war, these provlnces have also receivedmuchless public resources than others. They are home to about&#13;
58 percent o f Angola's population and are expected to receive some 30 percent of the internally displaced&#13;
people returning home.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
40.     About 18 percent o f the proposed program`s resources are for delivery of health services and&#13;
education. This will help address people's most urgent needs and lay the foundations for longer-term&#13;
programs. About 6 percent o f resources would directly support rural development, mainly through seed&#13;
multiplication and distribution and improvement o f rural feeder roads to help farmers obtain critical&#13;
inputs and market their outputs. Another 20 percent o f the program's resources are for rehabilitation of&#13;
transportation infrastructure, withthe priority given to roads and bridges. Reestablishing transportation&#13;
linksisvital to stabilize the economy and promote economic recovery includingintherural areas, and to&#13;
ensure that the inputs needed for reconstruction o f infrastructure inother sectors can be delivered on time&#13;
and at reasonable cost. About 37 percent of the resources are for rehabilitation of electricity and water&#13;
supply systems, and for stabilizationofurban structures against natural disasters. This will help improve&#13;

health o f the population, and stimulate growth o f enterprises. Another 6 percent is for capacity building&#13;
and analytical and advisory services. Finally, 7 percent i s allocated to program managementand&#13;
monitoringo fthis complex program.&#13;

&#13;
42.     Five key lessonsare reflected inthe programdesign:&#13;
&#13;
        0    Activities are beingdesigned comprehensively and inan integrated manner to ensure&#13;
             coherence and synergy betweensectors. Inaddition, work onroads, water supply systems,&#13;
             electricity, and the like will be closely coordinated to ensure that work i s properly sequenced&#13;
             and that bottlenecks are minimized.&#13;
&#13;
        0    Government agencies are deeply involvedinthe preparation o f the activities and will be&#13;
             involvedinimplementation. This will buildownership and capacity to undertake future&#13;
             projects.&#13;
&#13;
        0    Activities have been identified and designedwith the participationo f all key stakeholders,&#13;
             including civil society organizations andthe private sector, whenever feasible. This will help&#13;
             to ensure that resources are spent wisely and that benefits are widely shared.&#13;
&#13;
         0   Only the highest priority tasks have beenselectedfor the EMRPgiven the limitedabsorptive&#13;
             capacity and the constraints to secure full financing for the program.&#13;
&#13;
         0   GivenAngola's limitedadministrative capacity, and to allow the government to build&#13;
             capacity over time, adequate temporary implementation arrangements have been designed.&#13;

PART 3 -DETAILED PROGRAM AND PROJECTDESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
A.      Programobjectives&#13;
&#13;
43.     The overall purpose o fthe proposedEmergency Multisector Reconstruction Program(EMRP) to&#13;
be implementedintwo phasesi s to help to buildthe foundation for long-term reconstruction, economic&#13;
rehabilitation, and the reestablishment o f state administrationthroughout the country. The specific&#13;
objectives o fthe program are to assist the government to (a) improve rural incomes and enhance food&#13;
security inthe provinces most affectedby the conflict, (b) improve access to essential education and&#13;
health services inthe provinces most affected bythe conflict, (c) reconstruct andrehabilitate critical&#13;
infrastructure, and (d) strengthen capacity o f government at all levels to formulate, prepare, implement,&#13;
and manage mediumand long-term development programs. These objectives are consistent with those o f&#13;
the ECP and with the PPMRRP. The proposedprogram i s the contribution o fthe Bank to the PPMRRP.&#13;
Phase 1o f the proposed program (EMRP) is the project.&#13;
&#13;
44.     The EMRP will help revive the economy and reintegrate the country by restoringvital&#13;
transportation links and supporting provision o f basic public services to the population. It will help&#13;
prevent the further deterioration o f healthand loss o f life o f citizens by deliveringhealthcare and other&#13;
basic services, restoring water supply services, and improvingpublic health conditions incities. Itwill&#13;
helpto reducepoverty among bothruralandurbanresidentsby stimulating agricultural production and&#13;
reducing the costs and time o f transporting food from producers to markets. Over the mediumand longer&#13;
terms, it will benefit the people o fAngola byhelpingto create an improved legal andregulatory&#13;
framework and more stable and effective institutions-critical conditions for better governance. Finally,&#13;
itwill help support the development ofthepolicyandinstitutionalreforms neededfor the country's&#13;
medium and long-term development.&#13;
&#13;
 B.      Programphasing&#13;
&#13;
45.     Recent constraints on IDA 13 resourcesfor fiscal 2005 require the Bank to finance the programin&#13;
two phases, withthe secondphaseplannedto be submittedfor Boardconsideration when IDA 14 funds&#13;
become available. The programhas thus been split into two coherent, self-standing, and complementary&#13;
phases. The first phaseproject o fUS$92 million equivalent i s fully fundedwith support o f IDA 13&#13;
resources (IDA contribution o fUS$50.7 million equivalent o f which US$24.9 million inthe form o f an&#13;
IDA credit andUS25.8 million inthe form of an IDA grant) and will beimplementedduring fiscal&#13;
years 2005-08, closing onDecember 31,2007. The foreseen secondphase o fUS$213 million equivalent&#13;
for which IDA financing could amount to some US$150 million when IDA 14 funds will become&#13;
available i s expected to be submittedfor Board consideration withinnine to twelve months o fBoard&#13;
approval o f Phase 1. At this stage, Phase 2 has been foreseento be implementedduring fiscal 2006-2010,&#13;
closing on December 3 1,2009.&#13;
&#13;
46.      Duringits first phase, the programwill focus on supporting activities that address the mosturgent&#13;
needsand can be implemented quickly. These include (a) activities to restart agriculture (particularly&#13;
productionand multiplicationo f seeds andplantingmaterial), (b) provisiono f essential drugs, logistical&#13;
support, and refresher courses for nurses and auxiliary nurses to improve health services, (c) provision o f&#13;
teaching and learning materials and assistanceto initiate teachers' training, and (d) support to restore&#13;
water services inLuanda and three provincialcapitals. Itwill also support (a) technical assistanceand&#13;
capacity buildingfor sector ministries and agencies involvedinimplementingthe programand the&#13;
project, (b) initial training programs, and (c) technical assistanceto buildlocal capacity to prepare for&#13;
decentralization, and (d) preparationo f the environmental and social impact assessment for the overall&#13;
program and the social and environmental management plan for the Phase 1project. Finally, it will&#13;
finance the management, monitoring and evaluationof the implementation o fPhase 1, support for&#13;
implementationo f the national demining strategy and actionplanwhich are beingupdated, demining&#13;
actions critical for successful implementation o f Phase'1project activities, and engineering studies&#13;
(detailed design, tender documents) andpreparatory activities for Phase2 o f the proposedprogram.&#13;
                                                      11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  47.          Itis anticipated that duringits secondphase, the programwill support rehabilitation or&#13;
  construction o f schools, and health facilities, and rehabilitation o frural feeder roads, trunkroads,&#13;
  electricity services, rural water and complement water supply ina provincial capital, and urban&#13;
  infrastructure. Itwill also support the preparation of the medium-termsector strategies, capacity building,&#13;
  a decentralization pilot, and continuing support for programandproject management.&#13;
&#13;
  C.           Programand projectestimatedcostsandfinancing&#13;
&#13;
  48.          The PPMRRF' is estimated to cost about US$1,997 million (inclusive o f taxes and contingencies)&#13;
  (Table 1). The proposed EMW is estimated to cost about US305 million (see Tables 1and 2). IDA&#13;
  financing (Phase 1and Phase 2) could amount to some US$201million equivalent (including&#13;
  contingencies), about 66 percent of the costs o fthe EMRP and some 10percent o fthe cost o f the&#13;
  PPMRRP. The government will finance about 30 percent ofthe program costs, including taxes and&#13;
  duties. Other donors (EU, UNDP, and the FrenchCooperation) are committed to finance some 3 percent.&#13;
  At this stage, about 25 percent ofthe costs ofPPMRRPremainunhded. Financingwillbe sought from&#13;
  other multilateral donors andbilateral donors to cover the gap through parallel financing. This will be&#13;
  done through a donor meetingon the ECP and the PPMRRP plannedfor September 2005.&#13;

D.       Programcomponents&#13;
&#13;
51.      The proposed programcomprises four components: (a) rural development and deliveryo f social&#13;
services; (b) rehabilitation and reconstruction o f critical infrastructure (roads andbridges, electricity,&#13;
water supply, andurban infrastructure); (c) capacity building, institutional strengthening and development&#13;
o f sector strategies; and (d) managementand monitoring o f the program and project, andpreparation o f&#13;
the next steps. The programhas beendesignedbasedon free-standing subprojects that fit within the&#13;
programbut that are not integrally linkedto other activities and that facilitate parallel financing&#13;
arrangements. IDA'Scontribution, duringPhase 1, to these four components constitutes the IDA financed&#13;
project (Tables 1,2 and 3 below).&#13;
&#13;
ComponentA: Rural development and delivery of social services&#13;
&#13;
52.     Rural development and delivery of social services (US93 million, Phase 1project is US$20&#13;
million of which theIDA credit will contribute US$15million under component A). This component will&#13;
finance support for rural development and for delivery o f health and education services inthe most war-&#13;
affectedprovinces, where delivery of services has been extremely poor. Community development and&#13;
social protection activities are covered under the ThirdSocial Action FundProject (US$120 million),&#13;
which was approved bythe Bank's Board inJuly 2003. Activities are designed to ensurethat&#13;
interventions inrural development, healthservices, education, and water and sanitation services are&#13;
integrated for maximum impact.&#13;
&#13;
Rural development (US819million, Phase 1project is US7 million of whichIDA will contribute US$5&#13;
million under components A, C and 0)&#13;
&#13;
53.      Objectives. The programaims to (a) help small farmers to restart their agriculturalproductionby&#13;
supporting the production and multiplication o fbasic and prebasic seeds and o fvegetative planting&#13;
materials; (b) buildcapacity of the researchand extension services; (c) buildcapacity o f the Ministryo f&#13;
Agriculture, particularly to coordinate activities, formulate strategy; and (d) facilitate marketing, through&#13;
the rehabilitation o f select feeder roads. Activities will take place primarily intwo provinces, Malanje&#13;
and Bit, becausethese provinces are major producers o f cassavaand maize, basic staples for Angolans.&#13;
&#13;
54.     Phase 1project. Duringthe project (Phase l), will help to scale-up production ofbasic&#13;
                                                           activities&#13;
seeds (primarily maize) and vegetative materials at the Chiangaresearch center inHuambo province in&#13;
central Angola, and vegetative materials o f cassavaand sweet potato at the Malange research center inthe&#13;
northo fthe country. The research centerswill supply the seeds and vegetative material for multiplication&#13;
to farmers, to farmers' organizations, or to NGOs inMalange and BiCprovinces under arrangementsto be&#13;
agreedbetween the government, donors, NGOs, and other partners. Itwill also finance procurement o f&#13;
equipment for the laboratory inLuanda, for the local offices o fthe Institute o f Agriculture Development,&#13;
the Instituto de Investigapiio Agronomica (IIA), and Servipo Nationalde Sementes(SENSE). The project&#13;
will also support trainingand capacity buildingfor the technicians involved.&#13;
&#13;
55.      The project will be implementedintwo stages: (a) production o fbasic seeds andprimary&#13;
vegetative planting materials, and (b) multiplicationo f improved quality seeds and vegetative planting&#13;
materials. The IIA will manage the first stage, and beresponsible for producingbasic material o f&#13;
improvedandwell-adapted varieties for the agro-ecological conditions o fthe central andnorthernregions o f&#13;
Angola. Currently, boththe Chianga and Malangeresearch centers are producingbasic seeds and&#13;
vegetative materials and have adequate staff and land. To scale-up the production the IIArequires:&#13;
&#13;
     0   Agricultural equipment, such as tractors and respective tools; vehicles to transport technicians&#13;
         and goods; a seedprocessing unit; a water pump for irrigation system; rehabilitationo f offices; s&#13;
         storage facility; and equipment to equip a seeds lab.&#13;
     0   Agricultural inputs for the production of the basic seeds for the first three seasons.&#13;
     0   Training o f staff through short courses in-country and more in-depth courses outside the country.&#13;
                                                        14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56.     A partnership comprisingthe Institute of Agriculture Development, SENSE, NGOs, and farmers&#13;
will managethe secondstage. The secondstage is complex becauseitrequires effectivecoordination&#13;
between all participating actors, who must strictly observe the technical and procedural guidelines&#13;
developed by the IIA for multiplication o f seeds and vegetative materials. Support for the secondstage&#13;
requires:&#13;
&#13;
    0   Rehabilitationo f 12 EstaqBode Desenvolvimento Agricolas inMalanje and BiC, which will&#13;
        include the offices, the warehouse, accommodation for technicians, communications equipment, a&#13;
        small seed processor, and cars and motorcycles for technicians; the studies and designs for the&#13;
        rehabilitation o f the EstaqBo de Desenvolvimento Agricolas will be preparedwithfunds from the&#13;
        Project Preparation Facilitybefore effectiveness, so that the civil works may start once the project&#13;
        becomes effective.&#13;
    0   Training and capacity buildingfor the technicians o f the Institute o f Agriculture Development.&#13;
    0   Rehabilitationof one SENSE's laboratoryinLuanda, two fieldoffices (inMelange and BiC), and&#13;
        motor cycles and cars to transport the technicians.&#13;
    0   Training and capacity buildingfor SENSE'Stechnicians.&#13;
&#13;
57.     The approach for improved quality seed multiplication entails the following distribution of roles&#13;
and responsibilities:&#13;
&#13;
    0   IIAwill produce andprovide the basic seeds andprimaryvegetative materials&#13;
        The Institute o f Agriculture Development, through its EstaqBode DesenvolvimentoAgricolas,&#13;
        andpartner NGOs willjointly identify and select potential multipliers around the selectedregions&#13;
        inMalanjeandBie?&#13;
    0   NGOswill engage the private and small multipliers throughthe signing ofout-growing contracts&#13;
        with the modalitieso f financial and technical support clearly specified.&#13;
    0   The Institute o f Agriculture Development will provide the required technical advice and&#13;
        extension services.&#13;
    0   SENSE will oversee compliance with the technical guidelines byrandomly inspecting seed&#13;
        productionplots and subsequentharvests, storage, drying, shelling and processing operations.&#13;
        SENSE will also take and receive seed samples for testingand certification when so required.&#13;
    0   NGOs will purchasethe producedimproved seeds and vegetative materials, and following a&#13;
        policy and plan agreedwithInstitute o fAgriculture Development and the EstaqBode&#13;
        DesenvolvimentoAgricolas, will distributeit to smallholders andrural communities. Ingeneral, the&#13;
        recipients will be expectedto retumback aproportionof output, equal to the quantityo fseeds&#13;
        received and an agreedadditional amount.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The donors andor NGOs and the government will agree on the terms of the partnership among themselves,&#13;
Some potentialNGOs for involvement inmultiplication include World Vision, Adra, Africare and Care, among&#13;
others. Chevron-Texaco has expressed willingness to support one or more NGOs for this work.&#13;
 InMalanje, the six selectedEstaqgodeDesenvolvimentoAgricolas are locatedinthe municipalitiesofMalanje,&#13;
Cacuso, Kakulama, Kalandula, Kzaba-Nzogi and Kalandula. Inthe case o f Bik, the Estaqlo de Desenvolvimento&#13;

lulometers o fruralroads (375 lulometers ineach ofMalanje and Bit provinces for an estimated total base&#13;
cost ofUS$9.3 million) over a period of 24 months. The final selection o froads will depend on the&#13;
financial costs to be determined by field surveys and engineering designs. The surveys and engineering&#13;
design (estimated at some US$730,000 base cost) will be prepared inthe first phaseunder component D.&#13;

60.      Management arrangements. The agreedmanagement approach for the agriculture and rural&#13;
development subcomponent relies on the project management and implementation unit(PMIU) for&#13;
procurement, financial management while fully involvingthe Ministry of Agriculture inimplementation.&#13;
&#13;
                                                          16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Although most o f the activities o fthe subcomponent will be implementedat the local level, the provincial&#13;
and central levels will also be involved. Therefore, management and coordination structures will be&#13;
established at all three levels.&#13;
&#13;
61.       At the central level, there will be an oversight andpolicy committee, comprising the national&#13;
directors o f the five institutions (IIA, SENSE, Instituteof Agriculture Development, NationalDirectorate&#13;
of Agriculture and Forest, NationalDirectorate of RuralDevelopment), that will be chaired by the by the&#13;
vice minister o f agriculture. A coordinationunitwill be established, comprising technicians of IIA,&#13;
SENSE, Institute ofAgriculture Development, one accountant, and one monitoring and evaluationoffice.&#13;
Itwill be coordinated byan executive coordinator hiredunder Bank finance from outside the Ministryo f&#13;
Agriculture usingthe Bank-recommended procedures The vice minister's assistantwill be responsible&#13;
                                                           .&#13;
for the daily liaison between the vice minister and boththe oversight and policy committee and the PMIU.&#13;
&#13;
62.       At the provincial level, an operational workinggroups will be established inMalanje and another&#13;
inBiCor Huambo) comprising the technicians ofIIA,SENSE, InstituteofAgncultureDevelopment,&#13;
participatingNGOs, a representative ofthe provincial directorate o f agriculture and rural development6&#13;
This working group will prepare the provincial work plan, ensurethe support requiredbyEstaqZiode&#13;

other partners. At the municipal level estag6eswill beresponsible for coordinating activities through&#13;
arrangements agreedwith participatingNGOs and other partners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    It is recommendedthat the provincial directors ofthe Institute ofAgricultureDevelopment coordinatethe&#13;
working groups.&#13;

&#13;
     63.       Background. The war has left hundreds o f healthfacilities destroyed, looted or abandoned,&#13;
     mainly inthe ruralareas. The government has issueda decree: the "Regulamento Geral das Unidades&#13;
     Sanitarias do Servigo Nacional de Saiide" to guide the development ofthe network o f health&#13;
                                                         18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
infrastructure. However, muchremains to be done to ensurethat the decree i s disseminated and to clarify&#13;
and standardize the needs assessment o fhealthfacilities, human resources development, and the provision&#13;
o f drugs and other essential supplies. The Ministryo fHealth i s working to improve the delivery o fhealth&#13;
services, which compares unfavorably with other countries with similar income levels.&#13;
&#13;
64.      The govemment has mademany attempts to elaborate a sound policy framework, decentralize&#13;
decisionmaking, and deconcentratethe delivery o fhealthservices. Muchremains to be done to adjust&#13;
the institutional and legal framework to thenewroles andresponsibilities ofthe different administrative&#13;
levels (central, intermediary, and local); further decentralize decision makmg; and strengthen the&#13;
capabilities o f the provincialand municipal government entities to properly managehuman, financial, and&#13;
other resources. The national directorates, especially the ones linkedto diseasecontrol, are organized by&#13;
diseaselines and are supported vertically by donors and still need to elaborate sound strategies and action&#13;
plans.&#13;
&#13;
65.      Objectives. The objectives of the proposed health subcomponent are to reduce the highmatemal&#13;
and child mortality, andreduce the incidence o fHIV/AIDS and o f sexually transmitted diseases in&#13;
selectedareas o f the selectedprovinces. This will be achieved by increasing the coverage and improving&#13;
the quality o f essential primary health care services to pregnant women and children, particularly those&#13;
displaced by the war, byprovidinga minimumpackage o fhealthcare services inselected areas o fthe&#13;
selectedprovinces, training of healthcare providers, providingessential medicines and supplies,&#13;
strengthening efforts to reduce the spreado fHIV/AIDS, and by strengthening the provincialand&#13;
municipal healthteams. Participatingprovinces include Malanje, Moxico, Bit and Kwanza Norte,&#13;
underserved provinces with large numbers of war-affected people. Studies, training, and provision o f&#13;
essential drugs will take place throughout the country.&#13;
&#13;
66.      Phase 1project. The project will support the preparation o fthe architectural studies neededfor&#13;
repair and reconstructiono fthe health facilities to be carriedout under Phase2 (under Component D).&#13;
The project will also finance the procurement o f ambulances, motorcycles, and bicycles to ensurethat all&#13;
four provincial capitals and selectedmunicipalities have the meansto sendpatients to referral units. It&#13;
will provide training to improve the quality o f services aimedat preventing and treating common disease,&#13;
such as malaria and trypanosomiasis; andpromoting improvedmatemal and child care. The project will&#13;
inadditionprovide h t s ofessentialdrugsto healthposts, healthcenters, andmunicipal hospitals;&#13;
logistical support to the Ministryo f Healthinthe four provinces targeted for the project, refresher training&#13;
for nurses and auxiliary nurses, training of municipal healthteams, and strengtheningthe health&#13;
information system. The project will also train health care providers to counsel clients affected by&#13;
HIV/AIDSandhowto protect clientsandthemselves from infection. Itwill include limitededucation&#13;
and communication interventions aimed at stopping the spreado f HIV/AIDSand at helping those&#13;
affected.&#13;
&#13;
67.      Phase 2. Duringits secondphase the health subcomponent will support a continuationo f the&#13;
activities started under Phase 1(procurement o f essential drugs; training, especially relatedto integrated&#13;
management o f childhood illnesses and essential obstetric care; and institutional strengthening). Itwill in&#13;
addition support the rehabilitation o f about 59 healthposts, 15 health centers, two municipalhospitals,&#13;
nine houses for healthpersonnel, and selected interventions to upgrade the four provincialhospitals (such&#13;
as the operating theater), the nursing school o fMalange, and two warehouses for drugs. Incoordination&#13;
with the proposedBank-supported HIVIAIDS, Malaria, Sexually Transmitted Diseases, andTuberculosis&#13;
Project, the subcomponent will also support activities aimed at reducing the spreado f HIV/AIDS.&#13;
Finally, it will support the formulation o fthe national healthpolicy and the medium-termhealth&#13;
development plan (under component C).&#13;
&#13;
68.      Costs. The five-year emergency health program i s estimated to cost about US$35 million (see&#13;
Table 6). Phase 1project is estimated at about US$8 million, IDA will finance about US$6 million,&#13;
about 74 percent o f the total. The detailedcost estimates by activity are presented inAppendix 3.&#13;

69.      Management arrangements. The PMIUwill be responsible for procurement and financial&#13;
management. The planningbureau o fthe Ministryo fHealth will be responsible for coordinatingproject&#13;
activities among the participating entities: the national directorates o f human resources, public health,&#13;
drugs and equipment, entities carrying out rehabilitation and health sector emergency program, and the&#13;
provincialhealth directorates.&#13;
&#13;
70.      The Ministryo f Health will nominate a focal point to follow-up to the activities and to participate&#13;
inprojectmeetingsandother project coordinationactivities. Theplanningbureauwill decide whether to&#13;
appoint someone from within the ministryor to contract underproject finance an independent consultant&#13;
for this task.&#13;
&#13;
71.      The technical directorates within the Ministryo f Health, will prepare the biddingdocuments and&#13;
the terms ofreferences for consultancies. The planningbureau will review andcomment onthe&#13;
documents and provide themto the PMIU for inclusion inthe tender documents. The ministrywill&#13;
receive support andtechnical assistancefrom WHO, UNICEFandUNFPA for training and procurement&#13;
o f drugs, organizations with which it has several ongoing projects. Duringthe next 3-6 months the&#13;
planning bureau will draw on the expertise o fthe project implementation unit ofthe Bank-supported&#13;
HIV/AIDS,Malaria, Sexually TransmittedInfections, andTuberculosis Project to assistwith&#13;
procurement documents.&#13;
&#13;
72.      Giventhe limited capacity o f the Ministryo f Healthat the provincial level, the government i s&#13;
consideringpartnering with NGOsto execute some project activities. The participationo f NGOs or other&#13;
partners will be regulated by appropriate norms laidout inoperating manuals and standard contracts to be&#13;
developed underthe Project Preparation Facilityby the PMIU.&#13;

distributed. The project will also initiate training for about 1,379 new teachers who will be posted inthe&#13;
new schools, usingmodules and materials developed and testedwith the support from UNICEFand other&#13;
agencies.&#13;
&#13;
75.           Phase 2, Duringthis phase, inaddition to teacher training, activities will support the construction&#13;
and furnishingo f about 690 new classrooms (accommodating 55,000 students). Many o f the schools will&#13;
be built where no functioning school currently exists, financing related infrastructure, such as teachers'&#13;
houses, latrines, water and sanitation facilities, and an administrative office. The new schools are&#13;
expected to operateintwo shifts with a capacity o f 40 students per classroom, per shift. Finally, Phase 2&#13;
activities will help to (a) provide training intendedto strengthen school administration, management and&#13;
leadership o f school directors; (b) improve data collection, analysis and planning payingparticular&#13;
attentionto enhancing the management information system used to track teachers, student flows, and&#13;
&#13;

resources; (c) support selectedstudiesto assess the quality and usefulness o fproposed financed&#13;
interventions, and (d) support central and provincial directorates for implementation o f activities.&#13;
&#13;
76.     Costs summaiy. The five-year emergency education program i s estimated to cost about US$42&#13;
million, equivalent to equivalent to about 21percent o fthe overall cost o fthe education interventions&#13;
specifiedinthe PPMRRP. IDA will finance about US$30 million, nearly 75 percent o fthe total. A&#13;
summary of costs i s presented inTable 6. Details are presentedinappendix 4.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
77.     Monitoring and evaluation. Monitoring o fprogram activities would be carried out at all levels.&#13;
The Ministryo f Education at the central level, with provincial and municipalauthorities would develop a&#13;
simple form to collect datato monitorthe program. Municipaleducation staff will visit schools&#13;
periodically (at least once per quarter) to monitor the status o f construction, presence o fteachers and&#13;
availability o fteaching and leamingmaterials. Provincial staff will visit schools on a randombasis for&#13;
the same purpose andresolve issues that arise. Centrallevel staff would visit eachprovince twice a year&#13;
to monitor the status of the program and recommend improvements inprocessesandprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
78.     The ministrywill carry out a limitednumber o f studies to ensure that quantitative and qualitative&#13;
targets are being met. Ideas being considered include a study on use o f didactic materials inthe&#13;
classroom, and a study assessinghow the knowledge and methodologies leamed during training are being&#13;
used. Studies would be carriedout not earlier than the secondyear ofproject implementation.&#13;
&#13;
79.     The key performance indicators for the education subcomponent are:&#13;
&#13;
        0    Increase o f at least 25 percent inenrollment o f childrenbetween 6-12 years old inthe&#13;
             provinces covered under the project.&#13;

Water supply subcomponent (US$66million, Phase 1project is US$50.7million of which IDA will&#13;
contribute US$25.8 million under component B)&#13;
&#13;
81.      Government strategy. The government i s determinedto increase the supply o f safe water to&#13;
urbanresidents from the current three liters per day to least 15 liters per day by 2007. To achieve this&#13;
objective, the government intendsto improve the quality of water and the efficiency o f existing&#13;
infrastructure o f the EPAL. Inthe provinces, the government plans to rehabilitate and expandproduction&#13;
and distribution networks.&#13;
&#13;
82.      Objectives. The objectives of the water supply subcomponent are to increase the supply o f safe&#13;
drinkingwater to a minimumof 10-12 litersperday per capita inthe periurbanareas ofLuanda andto 15&#13;
liters per day per capita inthe three provincial capitals of Malanje, Kuito, and N'Dalatando by 2008, and&#13;
to increase the supplyo f safe drinkingwater inrural areas o f Moxico.&#13;
&#13;
83.      Phase 1project. The project will support restoration andexpansion o fwater services inLuanda&#13;
and inthe three provincialcapitals o f Malanje (Malanje), Kuito (Bit), andN'Dalatando (Kwanza Norte).&#13;
InLuanda(financedbyGOA), itwillsupport(a) rehabilitationofwater works, includingtheMulemba&#13;
distribution center, (b) construction o f 8-10 strategically located pressurized bulkwater distribution&#13;
centers, allowing trucks to circulatebetween four and five times more often thancurrent practice (water i s&#13;
now brought from Bengo, 50 kilometers away from Luanda), loweringtheir unitcosts, (c) constructing&#13;
205 standpipes inmarginal areas on the periphery of EPAL's network. Inthe provincialcapital o f&#13;
Malange it will support replacement o fnetworks (50 kilometers), 5,0000 house connections and 50&#13;
community standpipes. InKuito it will support replacement or rehabilitation o f water pumps, intake&#13;
stations, and electrical equipment; replacement o f40 kilometers o fnetworks; 4,000 house connections;&#13;
and 40 community standpipes. InN'Dalatando, it will support rehabilitation o fthe treatment plant at&#13;
Mucaririver, rehabilitationo fthe reservoir, and construction o f a 16-kilometer water mainto transport&#13;
treated water from the plant on Mucaririver.&#13;
&#13;
84.      Phase 2. Duringthe secondphase, activities will support additional investments inN'Dalatando&#13;
and inrural areas o fMoxico. Itwill also provide technical assistanceto strengthen the water utility.&#13;
Specifically, activities will includerehabilitationo f 35 kilometers o f the water network, providing 3,500&#13;
house connections, and constructing 50 community standpipes. Inrural areas inthe province o f Moxico,&#13;
activities will include the constructiono f 70 boreholes with handpumps,andrehabilitation o f five small&#13;
systems and 50 water points. The new water points and small water systems will be managed by&#13;
community organizations, which are expected to collect adequaterevenuesthrough water charges to&#13;
cover costs o f operations andmaintenance. UNICEFwill implement the activities inrural areas. Phase 2&#13;
activities cover also technical assistanceto the National Directorate of Water (DNA) and the Ministryo f&#13;
Energy and Water to reformpolicy and regulations for water services. Inthe three provincialcapitals, it&#13;
will include technical assistanceto help the water utilities provide water services on a commercial basis,&#13;
fully covering costsfor operations andmaintenance. To ensure sustainability ofthe investments prior to&#13;
completingthe sector reforms the contracts will include provisions for one-year o f operations and&#13;
maintenance following completion o fthe works.&#13;
&#13;
85.      Costs. The estimated costs are about U S 6 6 million (see Table 10). Phase 1project i s estimated&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
communities. Finally this component will finance the environmental and social impact assessment for the&#13;
overall project and the social and environmental managementplanfor Phase 1activities, it will also&#13;
finance the management o f environmental aspects o fthe investments inwater supply to be implemented&#13;
duringthe project.&#13;
&#13;
89.      Phase 2. Duringits secondphase, inadditionto technical assistancefor sector ministries and&#13;
agencies and training programs, activities will support preparation o fthe strategies for the key sectors:&#13;
agriculture, education, electricity, health, all modes of transportation, electricity and water and sanitation&#13;
(both urban and rural). This subcomponent will also finance measuresto strengthen local capacity in&#13;
preparationfor decentralization (more pilot trials are proposedto be financed to test policies on&#13;
decentralization and improvement o f local institutions). Itwill also finance the management o f&#13;
environmental aspects o f the investments inrehabilitation o froads and bridges, water supply, electricity&#13;
and urban infrastructure, and other Phase2 investments.&#13;
&#13;
90.     Decentralization and supportfor local development. Decentralizationhasbeenandremains at&#13;
the central focus for the government o fAngola. The Council adopted a strategic plan for decentralization.&#13;
This was followedbya study on decentralization anddeconcentration supported byUNDPthat developed&#13;
a local governance approach witha clearly sequencedset o f activities to implement the strategic plan.&#13;
&#13;
91.      Objectives. The main objective of the activity is to help buildcapacity o fthe municipal&#13;
administration to plan and manage the delivery o f sustainablepublic services inthe longer term.&#13;
Specifically the activity aims to (a) establisha model for financing the subnational administrations'&#13;
development budget; (b) create a mechanism andpractical tools for regular auditing, monitoring and&#13;
financial reporting requirements; (c) buildcapacity at local level to plan, budget, implement,and monitor&#13;
small-scale rural infrastructure, (d) pilot mechanisms for investment programming, budgeting,&#13;
implementation, assets' management, and accounting. Activities will be focused on four municipalities,&#13;
Kilamba Kiaxi (Luanda province), Kamacupa pic), Calandula (Malange), and SanzaPombo (Uige).&#13;
&#13;
92.     Phase 1. The project will support preparation o f a feasibility study that will diagnose the needs,&#13;
constraints and risks; define the nature, mechanism and modality o f fiscal transfer from the central budget&#13;
to the targeted municipalities; and define the strategy, management, disbursement and reporting&#13;
arrangements, policy objectives, possible impact, and potential for replication, and needs for equipment.&#13;
Itwill also support the implementation ofthe studyby (a) defining and approving the institutionaland&#13;
legal framework and implementation arrangements; (b) providingtechnical assistance,(c) building&#13;
capacity o fprovincialand municipalofficials, communities, and local contractors to plan, budget,&#13;
implement and monitor small-scale rural infrastructure; (d) identifyingthe mechanisms for investment&#13;
programming, budgeting, implementation, assets management, accounting; and (e) defining the&#13;
mechanism for monitoring and evaluation. Duringthis first phase, it will also pilot the fiscal transfer&#13;
mechanism&#13;
&#13;
93,     Phase 2. Duringthe secondphase, the activity will pilot, on a broader basis, the fiscal transfer&#13;
mechanisms. It will assistboth central and local govemment to (a) create the transfer mechanisms such&#13;
as the municipal development fund; (b) provide initial capital to the fund; (c) draft the management and&#13;
operational procedures for disbursement; (d) develop improved procedures for municipal-level strategic&#13;
planning, programming, budgeting, implementation, auditing, monitoringand evaluation; (e) design a&#13;
framework for monitoring local government revenue; (f) conduct a revenue generation feasibility study to&#13;
investigate opportunities for municipalities to generate as well as mobilizeincome; and (g) assist&#13;
municipalities inthe implementation o f selectedactions.&#13;
&#13;
94.      Costs:The decentralization and support to local governance sub-component is estimated to cost&#13;
about US$4.4 million. The Phase 1project is estimated at US$2 million o fwhich IDA will finance US$&#13;
1million. Details ofthe costs andmonitoringindicators are provided inAppendix 5.&#13;

&#13;
Management, monitoring and evaluation of project implementation (US$22million, Phase I project is&#13;
US$13 million of which theIDA credit will contribute US$4.9million). DuringPhase 1project, this&#13;
component will finance program management and monitoring and evaluation for Phase 1project&#13;
implementation. It will also finance preparation o f detailed design and tender documents for investment&#13;
activities that will be executed under Phase 2. DuringPhase 2, this component will finance technical&#13;
assistance, expertise, consultant services, operating costs, logistical support, and equipment for Phase 2&#13;
management and monitoring. The component will also finance the expertise and support neededto&#13;
update the national demining strategy and actionplan. It will also finance specific demining actions that&#13;
will allow the supported rural development and infrastructure investments to move forward. These&#13;
actions are particularly tailored to the rural development and infrastructure rehabilitationactivities and are&#13;
expected to be monitored through the social and environmental managementplan, which i s financed&#13;
under Phase2 o f component C. Appendix 9 provides details o fthe environmental and social&#13;

PART 4 -IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
A.       Implementationperiod&#13;
&#13;
95.      Project implementation period. The Phase 1project will be implementedfrom April 1,2005 to&#13;
December 31,2007.&#13;
&#13;
 B.      Capacityofthe governmentto executethe project&#13;
&#13;
96.      Capacity o f the government inAngola to execute the program and the project o f such scopeand&#13;
magnitudeinaccordancewithBankprocedures is weak. Nationalregulations cannot be usedfor the&#13;
project accordingto the Country Procurement Assessment Review carried out in2002 becauseo fmajor&#13;
problems with transparency, enforcement, and capacity that make them unacceptable for use underIDA-&#13;
financed projects. An action plan addressing the acceptedrecommendations o fthe Country Procurement&#13;
Assessment Review is beingimplementedthrough the ongoing Economic Management Technical&#13;
Assistance Project. Agreement has beenreached withthe government on the implementation&#13;
arrangements for the project to compensatefor government's weaknesses and to strengthen its capacity to&#13;
implement future development projects. These are described below.&#13;
&#13;
 C.      Projectimplementationandmanagementstructure&#13;
&#13;
97.      Project oversight. An inter-ministerial steering committee, chaired by the Ministryo f Planning&#13;
and comprising vice ministers (or their delegates) o f finance and sectoral ministries involvedinthe&#13;
project, will be responsible for overall project oversight.&#13;
&#13;
98.      Project management. Giventhe urgent nature of the project, the large number o f activities to be&#13;
completed within a short time frame, and the limited capacity o f the government, the following&#13;
institutional arrangementshave been agreedto ensure that funds disburse quickly, multisectoral&#13;
objectives are reached, and absolute transparency is maintained.&#13;
&#13;
99.      A project managementand implementation unit(PMIU) hasbeenset upby ministerial decree&#13;
(Despacho 0067/GMP/2004) within the Ministryof Planning and will be responsible for overall&#13;
management o f the entire multisectoral program. It will be headedby the Vice-Minister o f Planning (who&#13;
will also be the secretaryof the steering committee) as the project coordinator. A full-time project&#13;
administrator (a highlevel senior officer to be appointed or a project management specialist to be&#13;
recruited) will be responsible for day-to-day management o fthe project. The PMIUwill work in&#13;
coordination with the concerned departments inthe relevant ministries and agencies. Itwill have three&#13;
main functions: (a) procurement; (b) financial management; and (c) monitoringand evaluation o fproject&#13;
implementation. Itwill also be responsible for (a) assuring steady progress o f the procurement in&#13;
                                                      26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
accordanceto an implementation schedulereviewed andapprovedby the World Bank, (b) implementing&#13;
activities included inthe contracts o f the internationalprocurement experts to transfer skills to the local&#13;
staff, and (c) ensuring that a highethical standardand transparency i s maintainedthroughout the process.&#13;
Finally, the PMIUwill be responsible for ensuring that project implementationcomplies with World&#13;
Bank procurement, financial management, and disbursementrules.&#13;
&#13;
Interimimplementation arrangementswill apply prior to staffing and adoption o f acceptable financial&#13;
management system and manualprocedures by PMIU(see paras. 102and 129) beingput inplace. The&#13;
project unito f Fundo de Apoio Social (FAS 111)will provide temporary financial management and&#13;
procurement support for EMRP.&#13;
&#13;
100.     The line ministries and participating entities are expected to sign the contracts, provide technical&#13;
support to the PMIU(providing terms ofreference, participating indefining the short lists and in&#13;
evaluatingbids), monitor implementation and provide to the PMIUperiodic monitoring reports o f&#13;
implementation progress. The precise roles and responsibilities ofthe PMIUinrelation to the line&#13;
ministries and other entities participatinginthe project will be specified inmemorandums o f&#13;
understanding to be signed between the parties.&#13;
&#13;
D.       Procurementanddisbursementarrangements&#13;
&#13;
101.     Procurement, Procurement o f works, goods and services under the EMRPwill follow the World&#13;
Bank Guidelines o f May 2004. The thresholds for the use o f different procurement methods are presented&#13;
inthe TechnicalAnnex andwill be specifiedineachoftheDevelopmentCredit Agreements. The&#13;
thresholds for prior review by the Bank o f the Borrower's procurement decisions will be specified inthe&#13;
procurement plan and agreedonbefore negotiations. The two kinds o f thresholds have been set relatively&#13;
low to reduce the procurement risk, which i s considered high. About 95 percent o f the total value o f&#13;
contracts would be subject to prior review.&#13;
&#13;
102.     For phase 1, the PMIUwill contain a procurement section, headedby an internationally recruited&#13;
chiefprocurement officer and staffedwith at least two procurement officers, recruitednationally. Ithas&#13;
beenagreedthat untilthe procurement group o fPMIUhasbeenadequately staffed, the project&#13;
implementationunito f FAS 111,which is also located inthe Ministryo fPlanning, will performthe&#13;
essentialprocurement functions. The project implementationplanwill contain a section onprocurement,&#13;
which will incorporate the procurement manuals that have already been prepared for two other World&#13;
Bank assistedprojects inAngola.&#13;
&#13;
103.     The participating ministries and agencies will be responsible for preparing the initial requirements&#13;
for procurement, including the terms o freference, bills o f quantities, specifications, and the like and&#13;
providingthem to PMIU. The PMIUwill conduct the procurement process upto the award of contract.&#13;
The ministries and agencieswill participate inthe preparation o f short lists andthe evaluationo fbids and&#13;
proposals under the direction of PMIU. The contracts will be signed by the ministers or heads o f agencies&#13;
concerned, who will thenbe responsible for the management ofthe contracts. The PMIUwill monitor&#13;
contract managementand assist the ministries and agencies inthis task as needed. Payments for contracts&#13;
will be made by the PMIU against certification received from the ministry or agency responsible for the&#13;
particular contract.&#13;
&#13;
104.     Procurement for the project would be carried out inaccordancewiththe World Bank's&#13;
Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRDLoans and IDA Credits dated May 2004; and Guidelines:&#13;
Selection and Employment of Consultants by WorldBank Borrowers dated May 2004; and the provisions&#13;
stipulated inthe Development Credit Agreement for the project. The items inthe different procurement&#13;
categories are briefly described below. The Bank`s standardbiddingdocuments, includingthose for&#13;
evaluation reports, will be usedfor all procurementunder ICB and NCB procedures.&#13;
&#13;
105.     Procurement plan. A procurementplan for project implementation was prepared during&#13;
appraisal, which will govern the choice of the procurement methods usedfor all the contracts. For every&#13;
                                                      27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
contract that would be financed out o f the credit, the plan specifies the procurement methodor consultant&#13;
selection method to be used, whether there is aneed for prequalification, the estimated cost, prior review&#13;
requirements, and a time frame. The plan was agreedon between the Borrower and the project team at&#13;
negotiations. The plan is given inAppendix 13. The procurement planwill be updated annually, or&#13;
sooner as required, to reflect the project implementationneeds and improvements inthe institutional&#13;
capacity. Any proposed revisions to the agreedprocurement planwill be submitted to the Bank for its&#13;
prior approval.&#13;
&#13;
106.     Procurement of goods. Goods procuredunder the project would include drugs, medical kits and&#13;
equipment, school furniture and equipment, books, vehicles, trucks, motorbikes, computer hardware and&#13;
software, office equipment, pumps and other water relatedequipment, agricultural equipment, etc. Each&#13;
contract for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of US$200,000 or more would beprocuredunder&#13;
International Competitive Bidding(ICB) procedures. Goods with a total estimated value per contract o f&#13;
less than US$200,000 may beprocuredon the basis o fNationalCompetitive Bidding. Goods estimated&#13;
to cost less than US$30,000 per contract may beprocuredon the basis o f Shopping.&#13;
&#13;
107.     Procurement of works. Works procuredunder this project would include the rehabilitation,&#13;
reconstruction, or expansion o froads, electric power supply, schools, health facilities, water and&#13;
sanitation, and urbanworks. Works witha total estimated total value per contract o fUS$500,000 or more&#13;
will beprocured on the basis of ICB. Prequalificationwill be done for works contracts of US$10 million&#13;
or more. Works with an estimated value per contract o f less than US$500,000 may be procuredon the&#13;
basis o f NCB. Works estimated to cost less than US$30,000 per contract may beprocured on the basis o f&#13;
Shopping. Shopping procedures involve at least 3 quotations from suppliers or contractors inresponseto&#13;
a written invitation. For electricity supply, the standardbiddingdocuments for Supply and Installationof&#13;
Plant and Equipment will be used. Where appropriate, LimitedInternational Bidding(LIB) for works&#13;
may be used, as agreed inthe procurement plans.&#13;
&#13;
108.     Selection of consultants. Consultant services will be required for the designs of most of the civil&#13;
works included inthe project, construction supervision, studies, and technical assistancefor project&#13;
implementation. Consultant services will be procuredthrough a Quality-and-Cost-Based Selection&#13;
(QCBS) or other appropriate methods as specified     inthe procurement plans. Consultant assignments&#13;
estimated to cost US$200,000 or more would be advertised to invite expressions o f interest. Small&#13;
consulting assignmentsmay be procuredthrough Consultant Qualification Selection (CQS) or Least Cost&#13;
Selection (LCS). Technical assistanceto Municipal HealthTeams would be provided in4 provinces&#13;
through a QCBS procedure with a short list consisting only o f qualified NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
109.     Single-Source Selection (SSS) may be used inexceptional cases, where the provisions o f&#13;
paragraphs 3.9 to 3.13 o f the Consultants Guidelines are met. For Phase 1these items would include&#13;
construction supervision for water supplyinone of the 3 target towns to allow the constructionto start&#13;
without delay, and a rapidhealthneeds assessment and a healthneedsresources assessment to be done by&#13;
WHO. InPhase2, constructionsupervision assignmentsmaybe procuredthrough SSS, provided that the&#13;
original selection of consultants to prepare the design or studies was carried out through competition and&#13;
for the entire assignment covering bothPhases 1and 2.&#13;
&#13;
110.     Specialized advisory services would be procuredthrough Individual Consultants Selection (ICs),&#13;
basedon the qualifications of individualconsultants for the assignment inaccordance with the provisions&#13;
o fparagraphs 5.1 through 5.3 o fthe Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
111.     Procurement of Non-Consulting Services, Procurement from UnitedNations agencies for&#13;
supplies and works carried out under their ownprocedures may include UNICEF, WHO, UNDP, UNCDF&#13;
and/or the InternationalAgency Procurement Services Organization (IAPSO). The standard form o f&#13;
contract withUNagencieswill be used for such procurement. The items to beprocured from UN&#13;
agencieswould be agreedon inthe procurement plan and would originally include (a) three contracts for&#13;
the stagedsupplyofstudent kits, teacher kits, and classroom materials withanestimated value ofUS$l.O&#13;
&#13;

millionfor the largest o f the three contracts ;and (b) implementationo f the studies and capacity building&#13;
for the pilot decentralization activity through UNDP and UNCDF.&#13;
&#13;
112.     Training. Workshops and study tours will be conducted according to annual training programs&#13;
that will be submittedto IDA for review prior to initiating the training. The program will specify the type&#13;
of training (courses, study tours, workshops, on thejob, etc.), subjects, number of trainees, duration o f&#13;
training, staffmonths, timing, estimated cost, and the like. The procurement o f any training activities that&#13;
involve the hiringo f consultants will follow the Consultants Guidelinesby usingthe QCBS, CQS or LCS&#13;
for firms and ICs for individuals. The appropriate methods will be specified inthe procurement plans.&#13;
&#13;
113.     Operating costs. Operating costs financed through the project wouldbe procuredusingthe&#13;
implementing agency's administrative procedures, which were reviewed and found acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
114.     Direct Contracting. Direct contractingfor works and goods maybe usedinexceptional cases,&#13;
such as for the extension o f an existing contract, standardization, proprietary items, spareparts for&#13;
existing equipment, and urgentrepairs and emergency situations, according to paragraphs 3.6 and 3.7 o f&#13;
the Guidelines. The items to be procuredthrough Direct Contractingwould be agreedon inthe&#13;
procurement plans.&#13;
&#13;
115.     Prior review ofprocurement by the WorldBank. The thresholds for prior reviewbythe Bank are&#13;
specifiedinthe procurement plan. Table 8 shows (a) the thresholds for the differentprocurement&#13;
methods, and (b) the initially-agreed thresholds for prior reviewby the Bank. The Bank will preview&#13;
procurement arrangementsproposed by the Borrower for the items specified inthe procurement plans for&#13;
their conformity withthe DevelopmentCredit Agreement andthe applicable Guidelines. Any&#13;
procurement itemnot specified for prior review may be subjected to a post-review ofthe procurement&#13;
process.&#13;

&#13;
116.      Procurement risk assessment. The CountryProcurement Assessment Review o f 2002 covered a&#13;
wide range o fprocurement aspects, including(a) the degree to which the government promotes a culture&#13;
o f accountability; (b) the status o fprocurement staff, including salary structure and capabilities; (c) the&#13;
degree to which procurement is free from political interference; (d) the existence o f clearly written&#13;
standards and procedures; and (e) the degree o f efficiency, transparency and value-for-money. Ineach o f&#13;
these areas, the CPAR found that the Angolan procurement systemneeds major improvements, and,&#13;
consequently, i s considered a highrisk. The briefassessments carried out duringpre-appraisal and&#13;
appraisal found that very little hadchanged since the publication of the report inthis regard.&#13;
&#13;
117.      Three major probl,ems were identified:transparency, enforcement, and lack o f capacity. The&#13;
report found the following specific deficiencies relatedto procurement: (a) weaknessesinthe legal&#13;
framework and lack o f enforcement o f the existing provisions, (b)inefficientand costly procedures and&#13;
practices, (c) weak procurement organization and capacity, (d) weak auditing and anti-comption&#13;
mechanisms, and (e) payment delays that result inhigher contract prices.&#13;
&#13;
118.      Inconsideration of the presentprocurement situationandtheneedfor arapidimplementationof&#13;
the emergencyproject, itwas agreedthat all the procurement for the project will be carried out centrally&#13;
inthe MinistryofPlanning. Othermeasuresthat will be taken to minimizethe risks ofprocurement&#13;
problems to occur are (a) provisiono f training inprocurement to all local staff involvedinthe project, (b)&#13;
preparation o f a procurement plan with the participation of all the relevant ministries and agencies; (c)&#13;
creation o f a monitoring and filing system for procurement actions by the PMIU; (d) setting up o f a&#13;
procurement section inthe PMIU, staffed with international and national procurement experts, (e) the&#13;
large majority o f contracts to be subject to prior reviewby Bank, particularly inthe first year, (0&#13;
preparation and use o f appropriate procurement and other manuals, and (g) carrying out o fregular&#13;
procurement audits. The overall project risk for procurement i s high.&#13;

&#13;
                                                               30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
119.     Frequency ofprocurement supemision. The frequency o fprocurement supervision i s proposedto&#13;
be once every 4 months inthe first year andonce every 6 months insubsequentyears. Every supervision&#13;
mission should include a post-review o fprocurement decisions.&#13;
&#13;
120.     Audits ofprocurement anddisbursement ofIDAand government funds will be undertakenat&#13;
regular intervals by internal and external auditors. Appendix 7 presentsthe details o f the procurement&#13;
arrangements basedon the assessment carried out by the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
121.     Disbursement. All costs are inclusive o f taxes and duties. The government will finance 100&#13;
percent o f (a) taxes and duties (estimated at a rate o f 10percent), (b)expenditures for maintenance&#13;
services, (c) operating costs, and (d) recurrent costs. Inaddition, the government will finance (a) 15&#13;
percent o f counterpart funding for works and goods under component A, and (b)20 percent o f counterpart&#13;
funding for works and goods undercomponent B, and (c) 20 percent o fcounterpart fundingfor technical&#13;
assistance and engineering and consultant services. The disbursement schedule is expected to be as&#13;
follows: US$2 million (5 percent) is expected to be disbursed during IDA fiscal 2005, US$21million (42&#13;
percent) during fiscal 2006, U S 1 9 million (37 percent) during fiscal 2007, and US$8 million (16&#13;
percent) duringfiscal 2008.&#13;
&#13;
122.     Special Account. The project will have two Special Accounts that will be opened ina&#13;
commercial bank acceptable to IDA and will be operated inaccordance withthe Bank's operational&#13;
guidelines. Special Account A will be for the credit, Special Account B will be for the grant.&#13;
&#13;
123.     Disbursements from IDA would be initially made on the basis o f incurred eligible expenditures&#13;
(transaction based disbursements). IDA would thenmake advance disbursement from the proceeds o f the&#13;
Credit and Grant by depositing into the Borrower-operated Special Accounts to expedite project&#13;
implementation. The advance to the Special Account would be usedby the Borrower to finance IDA'S&#13;
share o fproject expenditures. Another acceptablemethod o f withdrawing funds from the Credit and&#13;
Grant is the direct payment method, involvingdirect payments from the Credit and Grant to a thirdparty&#13;
for works, goods and services uponthe Borrower's request. Payments may also be made to a commercial&#13;
bank for expenditures against IDA special commitments covering a commercial bank's Letter o f Credit.&#13;
IDA'SDisbursementLetter stipulates aminimumapplication value for direct payment and special&#13;
commitment procedures.&#13;
&#13;
124.     To facilitate disbursementsfor eligible expenditures for goods, work and services, uponproject&#13;
effectiveness, the PMlUwould be requiredto submit a withdrawal application for an initial deposit to&#13;
each Special Account, drawn from the IDA Credit and Grant. The authorized allocations are US$2.5&#13;
million for each o f the Special Accounts. Uponcredit effectiveness andunder the interimimplementation&#13;
arrangements not more than US$2.5 millionintotal i s to be disbursed. IDA would deposit the amount o f&#13;
US$0.5millioninto the Special Account A. There will be no payments from Special Account B inthis&#13;
period. Direct payments up to a ceilingamount o f US$2 million may be made inthis period. The&#13;
remaining balance would be made available whenthe aggregateamount o fwithdrawals from the credit&#13;
account plusthe total amount o f all outstanding special commitments entered into by IDA shall be equal&#13;
to or exceed the equivalent o fUS$20 million. Replenishment o f funds from IDA to the Special Accounts&#13;
will be made uponevidence o f satisfactory utilizationo fthe advance, reflectedinstatementsof&#13;
expenditure andor on full documentation for payments above thresholds for statements o f expenditure.&#13;
The Special Accounts would be used for all payments inferior to 20 percent o fthe authorized allocation&#13;
and replenishment applications would be required to be submittedregularly on a monthlybasis. If&#13;
ineligible expenditures are found to have beenmade from the Special Account, the Borrower will be&#13;
obligated to refundthe same. Ifa Special Account remains inactive for more than six months, the&#13;
Borrower mayberequested to refund to IDA amounts advanced to that Special Account. IDA will have&#13;
the right, as reflectedinthe Development FinancingAgreement, to suspenddisbursement o fthe funds, if&#13;
reportingrequirements are not complied with.&#13;
&#13;
125.     Use of statements of expenditure. All application for the withdrawal o fproceeds from the credit&#13;
will be fully documented, except for (a) contracts with an estimated value of less than US$500,000 for&#13;
                                                        31&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
works packages; (b) contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$200,000 for equipment and goods;&#13;
(c) contracts with an estimated value o f less than US$lOO,OOO for consultingfirms and less than&#13;
US$50,000 for individualconsultants; and (d) training and incremental operating expenseswhich may be&#13;
claimed on the basis o f statements o f expenditure. Documentation supporting all expenditures claimed&#13;
against statements o fexpenditure will be retained by PMIU, and will be available for review when&#13;
requested by IDA supervision missions and auditors. All disbursementsare subject to the condition o fthe&#13;
Development Credit Agreement and the procedures defined inthe Disbursement Letter.&#13;
&#13;
126.     When project implementationbegins, the quarterly financial monitoring reports (FMRs) produced&#13;
bythe projectwill bereviewed. Strengthening its accounting and financial management capacity will&#13;
enable PMIUto establish effective financial management and accounting systems, which should allow it&#13;
to produce the FMRs. Where the reports are adequateand produced on a timelybasis, and the Borrower&#13;
requests conversion to report-based disbursements, a review will be undertakenby the task team leader to&#13;
determine ifthe project i s eligible. The adoption o freport-based disbursementsby the project will enable&#13;
it to move away from time-consuming voucher byvoucher.&#13;
&#13;
127.     Governmentproject account. This account will be openedina commercial bank acceptableto&#13;
IDA. Counterpart funds will be deposited regularly inthis account inaccordancewithproject needs. To&#13;
facilitate disbursements for eligible expenditures for goods, works and services, uponproject&#13;
effectiveness, the government would be requiredto make an initial deposit to the project account o f&#13;
US$0.5 million equivalent for Phase 1covering an estimated four months o f eligible expenditures&#13;
cofinanced by the govemment.&#13;
&#13;
E.       Financialmanagement arrangements and audits&#13;
&#13;
128.     The public expenditure management and financial accountabilityreview carried out by IDA in&#13;
collaboration withthe government m March 2004 revealed that the measurestaken so far are not yet&#13;
adequate to ensurethat Bank-financed projects are managed transparently and inaccordance withthe&#13;
Bank fiduciary safeguards. The many existing off-budget accounts, a not-yet fully implemented financial&#13;
management information system, inadequate systems o f internal control and financial reporting ,and&#13;
inadequate extemal auditing, raise concerns. Under these circumstances, a "ring fenced" financial&#13;
management strategy, with dedicated bank accounts, and a project financial management manual will be&#13;
established.&#13;
&#13;
129.     To establish an acceptable controlenvironment and to mitigate risks, the measures specified in&#13;
the Financial Management Action Planmustbe implementedsatisfactorily. Three main actions are&#13;
necessary: (a) appointment o f an international financial management advisor, an intemal auditor, and a&#13;
project accountant for the PMIU(three months following effectiveness o f the project); (b) adoption o f a&#13;
fully documented Financial Management Manual which covers financial policiesandprocedures,&#13;
accounting and intemal control system, financial reporting, flow o f funds and auditing arrangements&#13;
(three months following effectiveness o f the project); and (c) installation o f an integratedaccounting&#13;
software, including data testing (four months following effectiveness o fthe project). Inaddition, the&#13;
appointment o f an extemal auditor under terms of reference and experience satisfactory to the Bank (four&#13;
months following project effectiveness) i s also important. A Bank financial management specialist will&#13;
undertake, duringthe first year o f Phase 1implementation, areview o f PMIUcapacity to ensure that it&#13;
has adequate financial staff capable o f establishing the necessaryprocedures and internal controls over the&#13;
use o f project funds. The financial management specialist will also familiarize the PMIUwith IDA'S&#13;
procurement and disbursements procedures, requirements o f adequateaccounting and submission o f&#13;
quarterly FMRs. Disbursements from the IDA credit and grant would not exceedUS$2.5 millionprior to&#13;
thisreviewbeingcarried out. The government mayretain for a short periodthe services ofaspecialized&#13;
firmto install, withinthe PMIU, the financial management system, prepare the manualofprocedures and&#13;
provide initial training to the staff o f the financial section o fthe PMTU.&#13;
&#13;
130.     A recent missionby a Bankfinancial management specialist hasreviewedwiththe PMIUthe&#13;
requirements o f submission of quarterly FMRsinaccordance with the Bank Guidelines. The PMIU is&#13;
                                                         32&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
expected to submit the first FMRs for EMRP operations six months after project effectiveness. The&#13;
FMRswill include (a) a statementof sources and uses offunds, (b) describe upto datephysicalprogress&#13;
for project implementation and (c) indicate status on mainprocurement actions.&#13;
&#13;
131.     Internal controls andflnancial managementmanual. The project's internal controls are&#13;
documented ina financial managementmanual. The procedures usedby the project to maintain its&#13;
records are also laidout inthe financial managementmanual. The latter include the requirement for cross&#13;
references to supporting documentation inthe statements of expenditure inorder to facilitate the audit o f&#13;
these expenditures and improve the maintenance o f the project's records. The PMIUwill update the&#13;
manualregularly to take into account any changesinprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
132.     The financial managementmanual will describe for the accounting system: the major transaction&#13;
cycles of the project; funds flow processes; the accounting records, supporting documents, computer files&#13;
and specific accounts inthe financial statementsinvolved inthe processing o ftransactions; the list o f&#13;
accounting codes usedto group transactions (chart of accounts); the accounting processesfrom the&#13;
initiationo f a transaction to its inclusioninthe financial statements; authorization procedures for&#13;
transactions; the financial reporting process usedto preparethe financial statements, including significant&#13;
accounting estimates and disclosures; financial and accounting policies for the project; budgeting&#13;
procedures; financial forecasting procedures; procurement and contract administrationmonitoring&#13;
procedures; procedures undertaken for the replenishment o f the Special Account; andauditing&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
133.     Planning and budgeting. Cash budget preparation will follow government procedures. Detailed&#13;
procedures for planning andbudgetingwill be documented inthe financial management manual.&#13;
Financialprojections or forecasts for the life o f the projects (analyzed byyear) will be prepared. Onan&#13;
annual basis, the project accountants will prepare the cashbudget for the coming periodbasedon the&#13;
work program. The cashbudget should includethe figures for the year, analyzed by quarter. The cash&#13;
budget for each quarter will reflect the detailed specifications for project activities, schedules (including&#13;
procurement plan), and expenditure onproject activities scheduled respectively for the quarter. The&#13;
annual cashbudget will be sent to the task team leader at least two months before the beginningo f the&#13;
project fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
134.     Accountingpolicies. IDA and counterpart funds will be accounted for bythe project on a cash&#13;
basis. This will be augmented with appropriate records and procedures to track commitments and to&#13;
safeguard assets. The accounting records willbe maintainedindual currencies on a computerized&#13;
system. The books of accounts will include a cashbook, ledgers, journal vouchers, a fixed asset register,&#13;
and a contracts register. The books o f accountsto be used for the project will be opened and a chart o f&#13;
accounts will be completed byproject negotiation. Annual financial statementswill be prepared in&#13;
accordancewith international accounting standards. All accounting and control procedures will be&#13;
documented inthe financial management manual, and will be regularly updated by the PMIU.&#13;
&#13;
135.     Financial monitoring reports. When project implementation begins, the quarterly financial&#13;
monitoring reports produced by the project will bereviewed. Adequate accountingand financial&#13;
management capacity will enable the PMIUto establish effective financial management and accounting&#13;
systems, which should facilitate the production o f the financial monitoringreport.&#13;
&#13;
136.     Internal audit. Considering the overall riskenvironment inAngola, there i s aneedto put inplace&#13;
a strong internal control mechanism and quality assurancesystem at all levels. The internal auditor needs&#13;
to be a certified accountant with relevant experience with donor-financed projects.&#13;
&#13;
137.     External audits. The govemment will recruit external auditors under terms o freference and&#13;
experience acceptableto IDA no later than four months following project effectiveness. .Any firm o f&#13;
auditors contracted to carry out the audit shouldmeetthe IDA'Srequirements interms o f independence,&#13;
qualifications, and experience. It i s recommended that arrangements for the extemal audit o fthe financial&#13;
statements o f the project shouldbe communicated to IDA through agreedterms o f reference.&#13;
                                                       33&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
138.    The extemal audit will cover all Bank funds and counterpart funds. Consolidated audited project&#13;
accounts should be produced, taking into consideration the new audit policy guidelines o f the World&#13;
Bank. The format to be adopted will be documented inthe financial management manual. Besides&#13;
expressing a primary opinion on the audited financial statements incompliance with international&#13;
accounting standards, the audit report should be submittedto IDA within six months after the end o f each&#13;
financial year. The auditor will be requiredto prepare a separate management letter givingobservations&#13;
and comments, and providingrecommendations for improvements o f accounting records, systems,&#13;
controls and compliance with financial covenants inthe Financing Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
139.    Financial covenants. A financial management system, including records and accounts will be&#13;
maintainedby the PMIU. Financial statements will be prepared ina format acceptable to IDA,and will&#13;
be adequateto reflect inaccordancewithsoundaccounting practices the operations, resources, and&#13;
expenditures inrespect of the project. Audit of the project financial statements, accounts, and records&#13;
will be carried out by an auditor acceptableto IDA and the audit report submitted to IDAwithin six&#13;
months o f the end of the financial year. The financial covenants are the standard ones as statedinArticle&#13;
IVofthe DevelopmentFinancingAgreement.&#13;
&#13;
F.      Supervision&#13;
&#13;
140.    The Bank will devote an average o f 75 staff weeks per year to supervise the project, and a total o f&#13;
300 staff weeks through fiscal 2008. Duringthe first year, supervision will focus on performance o fthe&#13;
executing entities inmanaging contracts, procurement, and financial matters, as well as incompleting the&#13;
agreed implementation plan. Duringthe followingyears, supervision will focus onprogress inexecuting&#13;
works, initiate the development o f the sector strategies, and strengthening capacity o f govemment to&#13;
implement Phase2 and future development projects.&#13;
&#13;
G.      Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
141.    The project will bebasedon the results-based approach. Key performance indicators have been&#13;
specified for each subcomponent of the project, buildingon experience inthe Democratic Republic o f&#13;
Congo with a similar multisector emergency reconstructionproject. The project will also make use o fthe&#13;
2000/200 1poverty analysis to prepare a baseline survey that couldbe completed during the first year o f&#13;
implementation for use inmonitoringimpact o fthe proposedproject as well as o f future operations.&#13;
&#13;
142.    Reviews. Inadditionto intensive supervision bythe Bank staff, reviews to assess progress in&#13;
implementingthe agreedactivities will be carried out every six monthsby the Bank, together with the&#13;
govemment and the other involvedparties. This will be part o f the government-donor coordination&#13;
process. The inter-ministerial steering committee through the PMIUwill beresponsible for preparing the&#13;
necessarydocumentation for the reviews and for planning the review meetings. Duringthe first reviews,&#13;
special attention will be paidto assessingthe distribution o f donors' support to the P P M W , with a view&#13;
to reorienting the IDA support ifnecessaryto ensure the equitable distribution o fresources overall.&#13;
&#13;
143.    A midterm review will be carried out 18 months after project effectiveness to assess progress&#13;
under the project, achievement o f overall objectives, role o f the different partners, and to eventually&#13;
reorient the project ifneededto ensure that it achieves its objectives. As appropriate, the govemment will&#13;
contract a consultant (under project finance) to review and assess progress in implementing the project&#13;
and to assist in preparing the necessary documentation for the review. The inter-ministerial steering&#13;
committee through the PMIU will be responsible for preparing the necessary documentation for the&#13;
review and for planning the midterm review meeting. The midterm review will evaluate progress in&#13;
reaching the project and program objectives, and will identify measures to improve performance if&#13;
needed. Careful attention will be paid to the performance o f the involved entities in addressing&#13;
environmentaland social issues and indesigning and implementing the various activities. Specialists will&#13;
assess the environmental and social impacts o f investments, both individually and cumulatively, and the&#13;
adequacy of safeguardprocedures agreed for the project.&#13;
                                                      34&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  H.       Coordinationof donors&#13;
&#13;
  144.     Currently, there is no formal mechanism o f donor coordinationinAngola. The government has&#13;
  not yet formally indicatedwhether Angola i s a RoundTable country, with UNDPtaking the lead on&#13;
  donor coordination, or a Consultative Group country, with the Bank taking the lead. However, the&#13;
  development partners supporting the PPMRRP recognize the importance o f coordinating their efforts to&#13;
  direct assistanceto priority needs ina timelymanner, to prevent gaps or overlaps, to ensure sustainable&#13;
  budget expenditure planning, and to reinforce their contribution to the policy dialogue. They have agreed&#13;
  to coordinate assistanceto the extent possible.&#13;
&#13;
  I. EnvironmentalaspectsandcompliancewiththeWorldBankSafeguardPolicies&#13;
&#13;
  145.     As an emergency recovery operation, processedunder World BankOP 8.50, safeguard&#13;
  instrumentsdo not needto be approved anddisclosed incountry andat the InfoShopprior to appraisal.&#13;
  The project i s classifiedenvironmental assessment Category B. Itwill focus on rehabilitationand&#13;
  reconstruction o f existing infrastructure and on deliveryo fbasic services. Currently, the environmental&#13;
  policy (OP 4.01), the involuntary resettlement policy (OP 4.12) (becauseo fthe potential for land&#13;
  acquisition or loss of livelihoods), and the pest managementpolicy (OP 4.09) appear to be triggered&#13;
  (because project includes procurement o fpesticides). Whether the forest policy (OP 4.36) or the natural&#13;
  habitats policy (OP 4.04) are triggered will be determined inthe context o fthe upcoming environmental&#13;
  and social impact study.&#13;
&#13;
  146.     Dueto the multisectornature ofthe program, andbecauseall the environmentalandsocial impact&#13;
  characteristics o f the project activities are not knowninsufficient detail at this time, a programmatic&#13;
  process or a strategic approach for environmentaland social assessment (including screening and&#13;
  categorization, preparation, public consultation, disclosure, review, approval andmonitoring) will beput&#13;
  into place and implementedover the four year life o fthe project. Inaddition, a resettlement policy&#13;
  framework will be prepared, addressing the policy, principles, institutional arrangements and procedures&#13;
  that the Borrower will follow ineach subproject involvingresettlement or loss o f economic activities, and&#13;
  disclosed separately. Becausethe project intends to provide pesticides, apest and pesticides management&#13;
  plan will be prepared, outlining pest management approaches,pesticide use and management; policy and&#13;
  regulatory framework, institutional capacity, and plansfor monitoring and evaluation. Given&#13;
  uncertainties regardingthe location o f some o f the activities, particularly o f the education subcomponent,&#13;
' and the complexity o f Angola's environmental and social situation, this approach i s designed to ensure&#13;
  that the site selection, design and implementation of all activities comply with World Bank safeguard&#13;
  policies. All individualenvironmental and social impact assessments, environmental managementplans,&#13;
  pest managementplans, and resettlement action plans for the various activities o fthe Phase 1project are&#13;
  expected to be completed within one year following the project effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
  147.     Becauselocal capacity for environmental and social management i s currently weak, it i s&#13;
  anticipated that an environmentalconsulting firm will be engagedfor an initial period o f three years to&#13;
  manage and oversee the environmental andsocial management process o f Phase 1project andpreparation&#13;
  o f the implementationo f Phase2, while providing institutional strengthening and on-the-job training&#13;
  services throughout the period, The firmwill inaddition help to buildthe capacity o f the Secretary o f&#13;
  Environment Estate, o fthe line ministries, and o f the other entities participating inthe project to manage&#13;
  environmental issues. The environmental consulting firm will also focus on ensuring that investments are&#13;
  screenedfor environmental and social impacts and that measuresare identifiedand put inplace to prevent&#13;
  or mitigate potential adverse affects. This firm will work closely with the Ministryo fPlanning and its&#13;
  PMKJ, the ministries and agencies concerned, and the Bank to develop procedures that will improve&#13;
  quality and sustainability o f activities through compliance with World Bank Safeguard Policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         35&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 PART5 -BENEFITSAND RISKS&#13;
&#13;
A.       Benefits&#13;
&#13;
148.     The proposedprogram (EMRP) will provide several importantbenefits. Most importantly, it will&#13;
help prevent the further deterioration o fhealthand loss o f life o fpeople who are livinginextreme poverty&#13;
by contributing to food security and delivery ofhealthcare and other basic services, restoringwater and&#13;
electricity supplies, and improvingpublic healthconditions inurban areas. Itwill helprevive the&#13;
economy bybringingdown the costs of transportation, which will increase the competitiveness o f goods.&#13;
Itwill help to reintegrate the country byreestablishingtransportation linksbetween the country's&#13;
provinces. Itwill help to reduce poverty among both agricultural producers and consumersby stimulating&#13;
agricultural production and reducing costs and time o f transporting food from producers to markets. Over&#13;
the mediumand longer terms, through capacity building,it will benefit the Angolan people by helping to&#13;
create an improvedlegaland regulatory framework and more stable and effective institutions-critical&#13;
conditions for better governance. Finally, it will help lay the groundwork for future policy and&#13;
institutionalreforms and a future investment program for the country's development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.       ExitStrategy&#13;
&#13;
149.     Ifprogressinensuring stable,transparentgovemment withbroad-basedsupport isunsatisfactory,&#13;
IDA, inclose consultationwith other development partners and civil society, will review its activities and&#13;
consider restructuring, scaling back, or suspendingits project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

            Program (Phase 1) Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall purpose of the Angola
            Emergency Multisector Recovery Program Project, (EMRP), to
            be implemented in two phases (Phase 1 and Phase 2), is to
            help build the foundation for long- term reconstruction,
            economic rehabilitation, and the reestablishment of state
            administration throughout the country. The specific
            objectives of the program are to assist the government to
            (a) improve rural incomes and enhance food security in the
            provinces most affected by the conflict, (b) improve access
            to essential education and health services in the provinces
            most affected by the conflict, (c) reconstruct and
            rehabilitate critical infrastructure, and (d) strengthen
            capacity of government at all levels toformulate, prepare,
            implement, and manage medium and long-term development
            programs. Phase 1 includes activities to prepare Phase 2;
            Phase 2 contains actions to prepare follow-on sectoral
            projects to meet the needs of the country during its
            development phase. The program comprises four components:
            (a) rural development and delivery of social services; (b)
            rehabilitation and reconstruction of critical infrastructure
            (roads and bridges, electricity, water supply, and urban
            infrastructure); (c) capacity building, institutional
            strengthening and development of sector strategies; and (d)
            management and monitoring of the program and project, and
            preparation of the next steps.
