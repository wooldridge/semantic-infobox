' /j    Nepal Rural Housing&#13;
Reconstruction Program&#13;
Program Overview&#13;
SCOPE OF THE DISASTER&#13;
On April 25, 2015, a 7.8 magnitude&#13;
earthquake struck Nepal. Following a&#13;
second strong earthquake on May 12&#13;
(7.3 magnitude), and a sequence of&#13;
aftershocks, the Government of Nepal  J&#13;
(GoN) reported the death toll at 8,700,&#13;
while those injured reached 25,000.&#13;
A Post-Disaster Needs Assessment&#13;
(PDNA), completed in June 2015,&#13;
found that total damages and losses&#13;
) iflt        Photo: The WorlId Bank&#13;
amounted  to  about  US$7  billion,  H   r   a  humansettlmentswere.dentiied.i.the. DNA.a.the.arges&#13;
with reconstruction needs of about single need, accounting for almost half of the total reconstruction needs&#13;
US$6.7 billion. As the earthquake sequence destroyed 490,000 houses -- mostly traditional mud-brick&#13;
and mud-stone houses built and occupied by the rural poor -- and rendered another 265,000 houses at&#13;
least temporarily uninhabitable, the largest single need identified in the PDNA was housing and human&#13;
settlements, accounting for US$3.27 billion or almost half of the total reconstruction needs.&#13;
NEPAL HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM&#13;
To address the housing reconstruction needs and to build a more resilient Nepal, the Government of&#13;
Nepal is leading the overall housing reconstruction efforts nationally through a housing reconstruction&#13;
program meant to encompass all of the housing stock to be rebuilt. The program will also serve as a&#13;
coordinating framework to standardize housing reconstruction policy, irrespective of the funding sources.&#13;
RURAL HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM (RHRP)&#13;
The Rural Housing Reconstruction Program will focus on restoring affected housing in 14 targeted&#13;
rural districts while providing technical support to enhance the government's ability to improve long-term&#13;
disaster resilience.&#13;
The program's overall objective will ensure that houses destroyed in the most-affected districts of the&#13;
country will be rebuilt using earthquake-safer building techniques through grants and technical assistance&#13;
to eligible households from the Government of Nepal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Nepal Rural Housing Reconstruction Program&#13;
The program also seeks to equip beneficiaries with skills to construct earthquake-safer core housing&#13;
units supported by training, technical support and a subsidy program, and allow people to continue&#13;
incremental construction with improved techniques.&#13;
To support the Government of Nepal's rural housing reconstruction efforts, a Multi-Donor Trust Fund has&#13;
been established with supportfrom the US Agencyfor International Development (USAID), the Swiss Agency&#13;
for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the World Bank. Key Development Partners, such as the Japan&#13;
International Cooperation Agency (JICA), are working in close collaboration with MDTF partners in extending&#13;
the coverage of the rural housing reconstruction program services to additional areas of the country.&#13;
BENEFICIARIES &amp; ELIGIBILITY&#13;
The program will directly benefit approximately 55,000 households (or about one-tenth of the housing&#13;
destroyed in the earthquake sequence) located in municipalities within the 14 most-affected districts of&#13;
Nepal: Sindhupalchowk; Kathmandu; Nuwakot; Dhading; Rasuwa; Gorkha; Bhaktapur; Kavrepalanchowk;&#13;
Lalitpur; Dolakha; Ramechhap; Makawanpur; Okhaldhunga; Sindhuli. A high proportion of houses in these&#13;
districts are categorized as completely damaged and/or in need of demolition.&#13;
Technical advice (provided through the RHRP), to improve long-term disaster resilience, will be aimed at&#13;
all housing reconstruction beneficiaries estimated to be approximately 490,000 households.&#13;
Eligibility will be determined based on a comprehensive, door-to-door assessment of the damages to the&#13;
housing stock in the affected districts, carried out by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS).&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES&#13;
Under the leadership of the Government of Nepal, the Rural Housing Reconstruction Program's&#13;
implementation has been carefully structured to reflect the program's operating principles (mentioned&#13;
above in Box 1) as well as the conditions on the ground. As shown in Diagram 1, there is both flexibility&#13;
as well as regular monitoring and evaluation to assure that implementation is responsive to the needs of&#13;
beneficiaries. Best practices have been gleaned from other international reconstruction experiences and&#13;
incorporated into the implementation structure and procedures for the RHRP.&#13;

&#13;
ï»¿IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES&#13;
The Nepal Rural Housing Reconstruction Program is structured&#13;
around five major stages of implementation (see Figure 1) --  Figure 1 - Building Resilience in&#13;
each one building upon the other, as follows:               Nepal: Stages of Implementation&#13;
Stage 1: The Survey&#13;
The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) is conducting a&#13;
comprehensive census of damage to the housing stock in each         Stage IV:&#13;
of the fourteen most-affected districts. Technical and logistical  Reconstruction&#13;
support is being provided by UNDP (United Nations Development       Stage III:&#13;
Programme). This door-to-door assessment will generate a           Enrollment&#13;
beneficiary/damage database to serve as the basis of the rural&#13;
housing reconstruction program as well as assist in the effective  Identificatitg IValidation&#13;
monitoring of the recovery process.&#13;
Stage 1:&#13;
CBS will liaise with the Ministry of Housing Affairs (MoHA)/      TheSurvey&#13;
District Disaster Relief Committees (DDRC) in the data collection&#13;
and use the data already collected by the rapid visual assessment that has been conducted by the MoHA/&#13;
Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MoFALD).&#13;
Stage II: Identification and Validation&#13;
Based on the eligibility criteria, an analysis of the survey results will generate a list of eligible households&#13;
at the Village Development Committee level (and when possible, at the local ward level). The beneficiary&#13;
list will be published at the local level and a grievance period of 35 days will be provided to allow for&#13;
inclusion/exclusion claims and grievances.&#13;
Stage III: Enrollment&#13;
Eligible beneficiaries will enroll in the program&#13;
by entering into a legally binding Participation&#13;
Agreement (PA) with their VDC or municipality.&#13;
The PA outlines the entitlements and obligations of&#13;
both parties regarding key details of the program&#13;
such as:&#13;
*  payment&#13;
*  housing construction standards and&#13;
*  grievance  redress  mechanisms  (how&#13;
beneficiaries can address any complaints).&#13;
During enrollment, those beneficiaries without&#13;
bank accounts will be assisted with opening one&#13;
or with determining another workable payment&#13;
mechanism.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Stage IV: Reconstruction&#13;
The principal of owner-driven reconstruction is fundamental to the Nepal housing program.&#13;
Beneficiaries will be supported with socio-technical assistance; training and market facilitation; and cash-&#13;
based assistance, provided in tranches, upon certification of earthquake-safer techniques guided by&#13;
Nepal's National Building Code (NBC). The reconstruction stage encompasses the following components&#13;
(see Figure 2):&#13;

Through Mobile Teams&#13;
INSPECTION &amp; CERTIFICATION&#13;
ta      Conducted at key stages of construction for payment disbursement&#13;
Stage V: Completion&#13;
In the final stage of the program cycle, the beneficiary will obtain the "Building Construction Completion&#13;
Certificate", which precedes the occupancy of the housing unit. At the completion stage, it will be vital for&#13;
the RHRP to broadly launch a clear communications message to inform beneficiaries on how to request&#13;
and obtain the Building Construction Completion Certificate.&#13;
