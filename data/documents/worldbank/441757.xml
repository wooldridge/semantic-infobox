The Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline&#13;
PeterL L. Law     The Bolivia-Brazil natural gas pipeline, which will transport natural gas more than 3,000&#13;
and Nelson        kilometers, will cost US$2.1 billion to construct. Despite the substantial benefits for both Bolivia&#13;
de Franco&#13;
and Brazil and the involvement of reputable private partners, the perceived risks and complex-&#13;
ities of this large project made financing it a major challenge. The pipeline will link supply in one&#13;
country to a potential market in another. Neither of these countries has a tradition of indepen-&#13;
dent regulation or economic pricing of fuels. And the pipeline will be the first major gas&#13;
infrastructure project involving the private sector in Brazil, where the natural gas market is&#13;
underdeveloped and the gas distribution infrastructure still very limited. This Note explains the&#13;
historical factors that shaped the project, how the financing package came together, and the role&#13;
the pipeline will play in liberalizing the Brazilian hydrocarbon sector.&#13;
FIGURE 1 THE BOLIVIA-BRAZIL NATURAL GAS PIPELINE         When the pipeline project started to get off the&#13;
ground in the early 1990s, the Brazilian hydro-&#13;
New pipeline       carbon sector was dominated by government-&#13;
Exising pipeli      owned entities and prices were heavily regulated.&#13;
At the federal level the oil and gas company&#13;
Petrobras, the main player in the project, still had&#13;
a monopoly on exploration, exploitation, refin-&#13;
ing, and maritime and pipeline transportation.&#13;
Natural gas distribution was reserved for state-&#13;
owned distribution companies, although petro-&#13;
leum distribution was open to foreign investors.&#13;
Prices were equalized across regions, and the&#13;
dRio de Janeiro                 prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and fuel&#13;
oil were subsidized. For Petrobras exploiting&#13;
Brazil's modest natural gas reserves had been&#13;
secondary to producing oil, and the share of natu-&#13;
