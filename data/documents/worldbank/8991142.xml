&#13;
    Haiti has been ranked among the most corrupt nations for the past several years in Transparency&#13;
    International's Corruption Perceptions Index.1 This fragile low-income country has a long history of polit-&#13;
    ical instability, poverty, and inequality. In 2005 the interim government of President Boniface Alexandre&#13;
    asked for the World Bank Institute's support in Haiti's efforts to address institutional vulnerabilities and&#13;
    improve governance. The government created a semi-autonomous anticorruption agency--Unité de Lutte&#13;
    Contre la Corruption--and a multistakeholder steering committee to lead the process of a governance&#13;
    and corruption diagnostic. This Capacity Development Brief explores the experience of that exercise and&#13;
    describes some of the findings of the diagnostic, which was completed in 2006. It highlights some of the&#13;
    positive changes that began to take hold following dissemination of the diagnostic report as well as some&#13;
    of the challenges that remain.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  In August 2007, when Haiti's anticorruption unit           diagnosing governance and corruption&#13;
publicly disseminated its report on governance and&#13;
corruption in Port-au-Prince, coverage of the event&#13;
saturated the country's media. The president, prime            The World Bank Institute (WBI) has developed gov-&#13;
minister, and finance minister all attended. Television      ernance and anticorruption (GAC) diagnostics as a&#13;
covered the proceedings live and replayed this cov-          country-level assessment methodology to complement&#13;

            This Capacity Development Brief explores
            the experience of describes some of the findings of the
            diagnostic, which was completed in 2006. The indicators
            measures of governance are: voice and accountability, rule
            of law, government effectiveness, regulatory quality,
            control of corruption, political stability, and absence of
            violence. The author have started to work to strengthen
            state structures and consider the legal and regulatory
            reforms needed in order for this endemic disease to
            disappear from our institutional practices, in politics as
            in business. Although Haiti's governance problems are
            fairly widespread, release of the survey has already started
            to have some impact, at least in terms of growing
            understanding and consensus on the nature of the problems
            the country faces. The survey served to focus minds on a set
            of critical areas that are impeding the country's
            economic and political stability.
