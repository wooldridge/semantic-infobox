ï»¿ANNEX 2&#13;
Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements among the&#13;
Participating WBG Organizations and the respective Donors.&#13;
1.     Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1   The Contributions shall be administered in the Trust Fund by the Bank on behalf of the Donors and&#13;
used by the Participating WBG Organizations to implement or supervise, as the case may be, activities in&#13;
accordance with the terms of this Administration Agreement. Each Participating WBG Organizations shall&#13;
be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this Administration Agreement&#13;
and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors, including, without limitation,&#13;
any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust&#13;
or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be considered a waiver of any privileges or&#13;
immunities of the Participating WBG Organizations under their respective Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2    Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered or used in&#13;
accordance with the Participating WBG Organizations' applicable policies and procedures, as the same may&#13;
be amended from time to time, including their procurement, financial management, disbursement and&#13;
safeguard policies, their framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and their screening&#13;
procedures to prevent the use of Participating WBG Organizations resources to finance terrorist activity, in&#13;
line with the Participating WBG Organizations' obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the&#13;
Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge&#13;
that this provision does not create any obligations of the Participating WBG Organizations under the anti-&#13;
terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual member&#13;
country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund by the Bank and&#13;
shall be kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be&#13;
commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has&#13;
legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the&#13;
"Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their respective&#13;
Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the&#13;
Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions,&#13;
the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on&#13;
the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of&#13;
exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Participating WBG Organizations nor the Donor shall bear any&#13;
responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
-6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Participating WBG&#13;
Organizations into other currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the&#13;
Participating WBG Organizations on the date of the conversion.&#13;
2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their disbursement&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of trust funds&#13;
administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to the Trust Fund to be&#13;
used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1    The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each Installment, an&#13;
amount equal to two percent (2%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2   In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program management and&#13;
Trust Fund administration, that are: (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above as an&#13;
administrative fee; and (ii) not included under Annex I of the Administration Agreements in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's applicable policies and procedures shall be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis up to a&#13;
maximum of three percent (3%) of the total Contributions under all Administration Agreements.&#13;
3.3    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund Fees&#13;
and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions significantly&#13;
differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration Agreement, or&#13;
if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to request a&#13;
change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments&#13;
made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new&#13;
Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration Agreements or&#13;
from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.     Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
4.1    The Bank shall maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the funds deposited in the&#13;
Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;

Trust Fund have been satisfied and the Trust Fund has been closed, the final financial information relating to&#13;
receipts, disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions shall be&#13;
made available to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website.&#13;
4.3    The Bank shall provide to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Fund Donor Center secure&#13;
website, within six (6) months following the end of each Bank fiscal year, an annual single audit report,&#13;

concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds&#13;
as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the Bank's&#13;
external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
4.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the Bank's&#13;
external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an external&#13;
-7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of reference of&#13;
such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange for such&#13;
external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such&#13;
audit, shall be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;
4.5    The Bank shall make available to the Donors copies of all financial statements and auditors' reports&#13;
received by the Bank from Recipients pursuant to any Grant Agreements (as defined below) in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies on access to information.&#13;

5.1    The Bank shall provide the Donors with semi-annual reports prepared by the relevant Participating&#13;
WBG Organizations on the progress of activities implemented or supervised by such Participating WBG&#13;

WBG Organizations on the activities financed by the Trust Fund.&#13;

shall agree on the scope and conduct of such review or evaluation, and the relevant Participating WBG&#13;
Organizations shall provide all relevant information within the limits of the Participating WBG&#13;
Organizations' applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by the&#13;
relevant Participating WBG Organizations, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such&#13;
review or evaluation will not constitute a financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.     Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank by&#13;

Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to Donors) after such date to the&#13;
extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all&#13;
the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank shall return any remaining balance of the Trust&#13;
Fund to each Donor in the Holding Currency in the manner specified in its respective Administration&#13;
Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by such Donor&#13;

amounts.&#13;
6.2    Any Donor may cancel all or part of such Donor's pro rata share, and the Bank may cancel all or any&#13;
Donors' pro rata shares, upon three (3) months' prior written notice, of any Contributions (paid and not yet&#13;

Organizations and any consultants and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration&#13;
Agreement, including any Grant Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a&#13;
cancellation, the Bank shall return to the Donor its pro-rata share in the Holding Currency as specified in the&#13;
Administration Agreement, unless otherwise agreed between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
7.     Disclosure: Dispute Resolution&#13;

(b)    By entering into this Administration Agreement, each Donor consents, as permitted under&#13;
the AlP, to disclosure by IFC of this Administration Agreement and related information on the Trust Fund.&#13;
(c)    With respect to any client or third party information that IFC, either directly or through the&#13;
Bank, communicates to the Donors, or any one of them, in accordance with IFC's reporting obligations under&#13;
this Administration Agreement, each Donor hereby agrees to keep confidential any information identified in&#13;
writing by IFC as confidential in accordance with the principles of the AIP. Each Donor will also ensure that&#13;
any access to such confidential information granted to its officers, directors, employees, attorneys,&#13;
independent auditors, rating agencies, contractors, and consultants will be only on a need-to-know basis and&#13;
provided that such persons are subject to a similar or equivalent confidentiality obligation. Each Donor and&#13;
IFC agree that should the Donor wish to publicly disclose any information shared by IFC, either directly or&#13;
through the Bank, with such Donor under this Administration Agreement, such Donor shall first ask IFC&#13;
whether all or part of such relevant information is disclosable under the ALP and then disclose only such&#13;
information as IFC confirms may be disclosed under the AlP.&#13;
7.3    The Donors and the Participating WBG Organizations shall use their best efforts to amicably settle&#13;
any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to the Administration Agreements.&#13;
