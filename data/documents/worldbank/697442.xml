BANGLADESH&#13;
INTEGRATED NUTRITION PROJECT&#13;
Credit and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:           People's Republic of Bangladesh.&#13;
Inplementing Agency: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW)&#13;
Beneficiary:        Not applicable&#13;
Poverty:            Program of Targeted Interventions. The Project would reduce poverty by improving&#13;
educability and productivity through better nutrition. It focuses on undernourished and&#13;
poor women and children. Beneficiaries would be selected on nutritional rather than&#13;
income criteria; but since the poorest, especially women, tend to suffer from severe&#13;
nutritional deficiencies, they would benefit most from the project.&#13;
Amount:             SDR 40.1 million. (US$59.8 million equivalent), including retro-active financing of&#13;
US$0.5 million to cover start-up costs of the Project Office.&#13;
Terms:             Standard with 40 years maturity.&#13;
Commitment fee:    0.50% on undisbursed credit balance, beginning 60 days after signing.&#13;
Onlending Terms:    Not applicable.&#13;
Objectives:        This six-year project will initiate development of a national nutrition program whose&#13;
long-term goal is to improve nutritional status so that malnutrition would eventually&#13;
cease to be a public health problem. The three intermediate objectives are: (i) national&#13;
capacity building; (ii) community empowerment for action against malnutrition; and&#13;
(iii) to achieve measurable nutritional impact in areas exposed to all components.&#13;
Description:        The project will have three components: A. National Level Nutrition Activities.&#13;
This component will have four sub-components: (i) Program Development and&#13;
Institution Building, to develop national capacity in nutrition and to promote needed&#13;
policy  research  and  operations  research;  (ii) Information,  Education  and&#13;
Communication (IEC) Development to assess current behavioral aspects relevant to&#13;
nutrition and develop appropriate messages and materials for use in IEC activities&#13;
through inter-personal methods at the community level and through the mass media at&#13;
the national level; (iii) Strengthening of Existing Nutrition Activities, particularly by&#13;
expanding and improving the effectiveness of efforts to control micronutrient&#13;
deficiencies and by strengthening the current initiative to promote breast-feeding; and&#13;
(iv) Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation to help finance a Project Office&#13;
and carry out baseline surveys, a mid-term review, and a final evaluation based on&#13;
sound methods and measurable indicators for processes, inputs, and outcomes related&#13;
to the project's objectives; B. Community-Based Nutrition Component (CBNC),&#13;
focusing on Growth Monitoring and Promotion activities with targeted and supervised&#13;
supplementary feeding at the village level in community nutrition centers, which would&#13;
serve as a locus for inter-personal Information, Education and Communication (IEC)&#13;
and mobilization of community actions to promote nutrition. This component would&#13;
be phased in gradually, beginning in six thanas in the first year (including a pilot&#13;
intervention of an experimental targeting strategy which entails special nutritional and&#13;
health services to newly wed couples and their first child), and after a review of the&#13;
first two years' experience, adding 17 more thanas in each of the third and fourth&#13;
years, for a total of 40 thanas; C. Inter-Sectoral Nutrition Program Development,&#13;
to improve nutrition through efforts beyond the scope of CBNC, by emphasizing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iv&#13;
nutritional aspects of activities in various sectors and by supporting innovative actions&#13;
with potential nutrition impact. An Inter-Sectoral Nutrition Fund would be established.&#13;
Sub-project proposals meeting agreed criteria, from Government or Non-Governmental&#13;
Organizations (NGOs), would be financed from the fund after being cleared by an&#13;
Inter-Sectoral Nutrition Cell in MOHFW and by IDA.&#13;
Benefits:           The project would help to: (i) increase the Government's capacity to formulate a sound&#13;
national nutrition program and to implement it effectively; (ii) improve the nutritional&#13;
and health status of children under two years of age and of women; (iii) increase child&#13;
survival and thereby strengthen the demand for family planning services; (iv) prevent&#13;
permanent damage in children, resulting in a healthier population in the long-term;&#13;
(v) increase the learning capacity of children and the productivity of the present and&#13;
future citizens of Bangladesh; and (vi) improve women's social status through a special&#13;
focus on them.&#13;
Risks:              The project faces three principal risks. (i) The country now has limited capacity to&#13;
implement nutrition activities. The project seeks to reduce this risk in several ways.&#13;
It would phase the introduction of the Main nutritional intervention, while working to&#13;
expand implementation capability. It would support a strong Project Office to ensure&#13;
effective project implementation and include a component for Program Development&#13;
and Institution Building. The project also includes an intensive involvement of NGOs&#13;
in project execution. Technical assistance will also be provided by UNICEF and by&#13;
Institute of Nutrition, University of Mahidol, Thailand.  (ii) Coordinating and&#13;
implementing activities undertaken through different ministries under the Inter-Sectoral&#13;
Component could pose difficulties. To mitigate this risk, the project would require the&#13;
establishment of an Inter-Sectoral Nutrition Cell within the Ministry of Health and&#13;
Family Welfare as well as substantive inputs from the respective ministries; the project&#13;
would also involve NGOs with relevant field experience in the preparation and&#13;
implementation of inter-sectoral sub-projects. (iii) There is a risk that volunteers might&#13;
be ineffective as Community Nutrition Promoters and Community Nutrition&#13;
Organizers.  The project would minimize this risk through strong training and&#13;
supervision at the field level, particularly through NGOs.&#13;

I. SECTORAL BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Nutrtional Situation in Bangladesh&#13;
1.1          General Background. Bangladesh is a tropical riverine country of about 115 million people.&#13;
The population density of this country is the highest in the world, excluding city states like Hong Kong&#13;
and Singapore. The country's economy is largely agrarian but 53% of the population are landless and&#13;
the prevalence of absolute poverty (inability to afford a daily intake of 1805 calories) rose from 22% in&#13;
1985-86 to 27% in 1988-89. Recent investigations appear to indicate that overall poverty (inability to&#13;
afford a daily intake of 2100 calories) might be declining but absolute poverty levels have not fallen. It&#13;
is one of the least developed countries in the world with a Gross Domestic Product of US$220 per capita.&#13;
The poor health status of Bangladesh is evidenced by infant, under-five and matemal mortality rates of&#13;
103, 180 and 6 respectively, per 1,000 live-births. The literacy rate is only 35 % with the female literacy&#13;
rate being even lower at 22%. Most of the women work in their households and have little decision-&#13;
making power. All these facts point to the existence of an overall climate conducive to undemutrition,&#13;
particularly among women and young children.&#13;
1.2          Major Nutritional Problems. Bangladesh suffers from some of the severest malnutrition&#13;
problems in the world. The primary forms of malnutrition found in Bangladesh are: childhood&#13;
undernutrition in the form of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM)'; all-round maternal undernutrition as&#13;
evidenced by low weight, short stature and anemia in pregnant and lactating women; and disorders of&#13;
micronutrient deficiencies, particularly among all ages of Vitamin A, iron and iodine. The effects of&#13;
childhood undernutrition, beginning with a low birth weight (estimated to occur among 35-50% of births&#13;
in Bangladesh) continue into adulthood, particularly among the females whose malnutrition is compounded&#13;
by the strains of adolescence, maternity, and lactation.&#13;
1.3          The prevalence of PEM among children is very high, and has remained almost the same for&#13;
the last decade. Thirty three percent of all children under six years of age are severely stunted and&#13;
another 31.2% moderately stunted2. As many as 68.3% of the children are under-weight' and 16.7%&#13;
wasted4, the highest rates in Asia. Malnutrition plays a role in about two-thirds of under-five deaths; of&#13;
these, 73 % are related to mild and moderate malnutrition. Given the greatly disadvantaged start by way&#13;
of a low birth-weight followed by inadequate breast-feeding by their undernourished mothers, average&#13;
Bangladeshi infants are already below the lower end of the range of anthropometric values found among&#13;
Western babies during the first three to six months.  The late and insufficient introduction of&#13;
Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM) is the most widespread form of malnutrition among young children, arising from a&#13;
deficiency of both proteins and energy (calories). It manifests itself as Kwashiorkor or Marasmus in its severest&#13;
forms but the majority of the cases which fall in the mild or moderate categories often go unrecognized unless the&#13;
child is weighed. The first indicator of PEM is under-weight for age.&#13;
2  Stuntinc refers to reduced height for age, which is a sign of retarded growth due to chronic malnutrition - often&#13;
accompanied (in its severest forms) by retarded mental development as well. Stunting is defined as severe if height-&#13;
for-age is less than the reference median by 3 standard deviations or more and moderate if between 2 and 2.99&#13;
standard deviations.&#13;
3  Weight-for-age below the reference median by 2 or more standard deviations.&#13;
4  Wastiln is a sign of PEM, which refers to loss of muscle mass resulting in a "skin and bone" appearance - generally&#13;
assessed by the ratio of weight to height.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
complementary feeding further retards the infant's growth; usually the child does not pick up its pace of&#13;
growth before two years of age. By then, it is too late to reverse the early growth lag which persists&#13;
throughout life and similarly some of the damages done to mental development are irreparable. The&#13;
weight-for-age curve of Bangladeshi children continues to lie below the third percentile of the Harvard&#13;
Standard, though it runs roughly parallel to the standard from around the second year of life onward; the&#13;
older children cope better with the adverse milieu of a food-insecure and unhealthy household, while&#13;
being unable to regain lost ground.&#13;
1.4        Maternal Malnutrition.  The nutritional status of women is not well-documented in&#13;
Bangladesh but the average weight and height of women are 39-41 kilograms and 147-148 centimeters&#13;
respectively, indicating significant levels of undernutrition. Mothers' weight gain during pregnancy is&#13;
poor and after delivery they end up losing about 1 kilogram as compared to the pre-pregnancy weight.&#13;
Iron and folic acid deficiencies afflict pregnant and lactating women particularly severely, leading to&#13;
anemia (para 1.5). As the Bangladeshi women bear and nurture children out of their already depleted&#13;
bodies more frequently than the women in the developed world, their situation is even more poignant.&#13;
1.5        About 70% of mothers and children in Bangladesh suffer from nutritional deficiency anemia.&#13;
Studies in Matlab conducted by the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research have shown that&#13;
25% of maternal deaths are associated with anemia and hemorrhage. Maternal anemia significantly&#13;
contributes to intra-uterine growth retardation leading to low-birth weight babies. Anemia in infancy and&#13;
childhood greatly reduces the cognitive abilities essential to the mental development of the growing child.&#13;
1.6        Vitamin A deficiency leads to xerophthalmia in children, and an estimated 30,000&#13;
Bangladeshi children go blind each year due to this deficiency. The prevalence of night blindness, an&#13;
early sign of vitamin A deficiency, is as high as 1.7%. Vitamin A is also known to provide protection&#13;
from infectious diseases in children. Besides leading to morbidity, Vitamin A deficiency also contributes&#13;
significantly to childhood mortality by increasing the severity of infectious diseases resulting in higher&#13;
case fatality rates.&#13;
1.7        Iodine Deficiency Disorders pose a major risk for the physical and mental development of&#13;
the people living in iodine deficient environments in Bangladesh. The food grains and fish from the&#13;
iodine deficient soil and water particularly in the northern region of Bangladesh contribute to the&#13;
hyperendemicity of iodine deficiency disorders in these areas. Iodine deficiency causes cretinism and&#13;
mental retardation in children. About 10.5% of Bangladeshi population suffer from goiter and an&#13;
estimated 60% of the people living in hyperendemic areas are affected. Two million under-five children&#13;
suffer from iodine deficiency disorders. Another 20 million children and women are considered to be&#13;
at risk. Intake of foods low in iodine is the primary cause of iodine deficiency disorders. The high&#13;
physiological needs for thyroxin during pregnancy increase the risk of iodine deficiency disorders among&#13;
women. The intake of goitrogenic foods also hinders utilization of dietary iodine.&#13;
1.8        Determinants of Malnutrition.  All the known causes of malnutrition are at play in&#13;
Bangladesh. These determinants are grouped commonly under the heads of food insecurity, poor health&#13;
conditions (and insufficient access to good health care services) and inappropriate household feeding&#13;
and eating practices (caring practices or "care" for short). Inadequate dietary intake of energy, proteins,&#13;
vitamin A, iodine, iron and other micronutrients constitutes the primary and most direct cause of&#13;
malnutrition in Bangladesh as elsewhere. There has been a downward trend in per capita intake of&#13;
calories over time resulting in widespread chronic dietary deficiency. At present, the average energy&#13;
intake is only 80% of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recommendation (2,310 kilo calories&#13;
per person per day). Such low intake has been attributed, inter alia, to inadequate food supply, poverty&#13;
and lack of education. Moreover, diseases that affect dietary intake by reducing appetite and/or decrease&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
absorption of nutrients, e.g., diarrhoea, respiratory infections and parasitic infestations, are widely&#13;
prevalent in Bangladesh.&#13;
1.9        As for food availability, food balance sheet studies show a gradual decrease of average&#13;
energy available per capita per day from 2,250 kilocalories (Kcal) in 1962-64 to 1,860 in 1983-85,&#13;
followed by a slight increase to 1,927 in 1986. Considering the rapid population growth, it is surprising&#13;
that per capita energy availability has not declined even more than it has; this is probably due to&#13;
impressive gains in agricultural production, particularly in the case of rice. The successes in rice&#13;
cultivation have been accompanied by decreased production of minor cereals, pulses, oilseeds and fruits&#13;
resulting in a nutritional imbalance in terms of national food production5. Moreover, the statistics on&#13;
supply depict only part of the food security situation; the picture described is based on production data&#13;
not on consumption patterns.  Disparities in purchasing power evidently lead to greatly unequal&#13;
distribution of available food, and averages mask worse deficiencies in actual calorie intake by the less&#13;
fortunate populations.  Important gaps remain between production and consumption, since food&#13;
availability at the national level is no guarantee of household food security and even the latter does not&#13;
necessarily result in equitable food distribution within the household.&#13;
1.10       Tables 1.1 and 1.2 show the relationship of childhood PEM with family income and land&#13;
ownership as observed by the most recent child nutrition survey of 1992 carried out by the Bangladesh&#13;
Bureau of Statistics. These relationships are shown for stunting which indicates chronic malnutrition and&#13;
wasting which reflects severe acute PEM. While the prevalence of stunting decreases with increased per&#13;
capita income and increased land ownership, nearly 30 % of even the highest income group and over 35 %&#13;
of those who own more than 5 acres show stunting. Income and land ownership do not show any clear&#13;
relationship with wasting. The report of the most recent survey by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics&#13;
does not present data on the relationship of income and land ownership with the third indicator of&#13;
malnutrition, namely weight- for-age but the previous survey of 1989-90 showed that almost 55 % of the&#13;
highest income group were underweight! In summary, these data clearly show that malnutrition in&#13;
Bangladesh is not limited to the poor food-insecure households.&#13;

1.11       Health and Environment. The well-known interaction between infection and malnutrition&#13;
is amply evident among Bangladeshi children. A recent survey showed that approximately a fourth of&#13;
the children had at least one diarrheal episode in the three months preceding the survey.  The&#13;
International Center for Diarrhoeal Disease Research found that children suffering from diarrhea are twice&#13;
as likely to suffer from acute malnutrition as those without diarrhea and the risk of severe wasting&#13;
increased with the number of episodes. About 75 % of the child's life is spent in illness mostly due to&#13;
infections. The chief immediate causes of death in infancy are diarrhea, respiratory infections and&#13;
neonatal tetanus. Low birth weights and malnutrition potentiate the death risks of these diseases.&#13;
Roughly two-thirds of under-five deaths are due to such potentiation, 75 % of it being associated with mild&#13;
and moderate malnutrition.&#13;
1.12       Age differentials. Table 1.3 shows the distribution of stunting and wasting by age groups&#13;
among the male and female children of Bangladesh. These data on the relationship of malnutrition with&#13;
age are very telling, indeed; not only do they point to the age at which the problem is best dealt with,&#13;
they also provide insights into the role of behavioral aspects (para 1.13) in causing malnutrition in&#13;
Bangladesh. Both acute and chronic PEM show a marked rise in the age group 12-23 months; but while&#13;
wasting declines after that, stunting stays at about the same level. Such difference between the younger&#13;
and older children is mainly explained by three facts: (i) the younger children are to be fed, while the&#13;
older ones eat; thus the older children better manage to overcome acute malnutrition but are unable to&#13;
reverse the earlier losses; (ii) poor maternal nutritional status is an important determinant of malnutrition&#13;
in the young infant but as the child grows, his/her nutrition is less affected by the mother's nutritional&#13;
status and (iii) much of the losses incurred in growth and development (physical and mental) are not&#13;
recoverable after two years of age. These observations provide the strongest basis yet for targeting&#13;
nutrition interventions on pregnant and lactating mothers and on younger children.&#13;
1.13       Caring Practices. The observation that some of the older children improve their weight,&#13;
despite the fact that they need more food than the younger ones, makes it difficult to explain childhood&#13;
malnutrition purely on the basis of lack of food in the household. Together with the weak relationship&#13;
between malnutrition and income levels (para 1.10), these data argue strongly that behaviors related to&#13;
feeding of young children have at least as much (if not more) to do with the serious problem of&#13;
malnutrition in Bangladesh as poverty and the resultant household food insecurity do. Most children are&#13;
breast-fed up to one to two years of age, but breast-feeding is often combined with bottle-feeding,&#13;
increasing the risk of diarrhoeal episodes. Colostrum is rejected by 60-90% of mothers; exclusive breast-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
feeding up to 6 months hardly exists; and 60% of hospitalized malnourished children are bottle-fed.&#13;
Weaning practices are poor and complementary food is generally inadequate with low nutrient density.&#13;
The frequency and manner of breast-feeding also affect the quantity of milk consumed by the infant.&#13;
Behavioral factors have a considerable influence on maternal nutrition as well, in view of the cultural&#13;
beliefs supplying reduced eating during pregnancy, the fact that the woman of the family usually eats last&#13;
and least and the lack of equity between the girls and the boys in terms of access to household resources,&#13;
not the least of which is food.&#13;

1.14       Among women as well as children, while food availability and health status are important&#13;
factors affecting nutrition, caring practices-feeding (including breast-feeding), culture-specific&#13;
consumption practices (particularly by women), intra-household food distribution, personal hygiene-&#13;
constitute the most significant, hitherto unaddressed set of nutritional determinants in Bangladesh.&#13;
B. Current Programs&#13;
1.15       Although there is no separate Government program to deal with malnutrition in Bangladesh,&#13;
considerable investments are being made in programs which directly or indirectly seek to address factors&#13;
that impact on nutritional status.  The Bangladesh National Nutrition Council consisting of senior&#13;
administrators, policy makers and nutritionists from different concerned ministries and agencies was&#13;
established to oversee the development of a nutrition policy and coordinate nutrition activities across the&#13;
relevant sectors. But so far the Council has not been very effective, partly due to inadequate resources&#13;
and lack of authority. Recently the Prime Minister has agreed to chair the National Nutrition Council,&#13;
raising the expectation that nutrition might get its long overdue share of attention. The national aspiration&#13;
for "basic food ("Daal, Bhaat") for everyone" needs to be expanded to include good nutrition, which&#13;
requires more than just food.&#13;
1.16       Programs aiming to ensure household food security directly by providing subsidized food&#13;
supplements to vulnerable population groups or indirectly through enhancing food production or income&#13;
transfer strategies are being carried out under the Ministries of Relief and Rehabilitation, Agriculture and&#13;
Food. Investments in enhancing food supply in Bangladesh have yielded fairly good results; crop&#13;
diversification, more efficient distribution systems and land ownership reforms are some further steps&#13;
which could be beneficial. Besides. programs such as Homestead Garden Promotion under the Ministry&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
of Agriculture add to household food security. Programs aiming at income/food transfer to the weaker&#13;
sections of society have been operating with variable effectiveness and at considerable cost. Examples&#13;
of such programs undertaken by the Government are: Vulnerable Group Development, Rural Maintenance&#13;
Program, Food for Work schemes and the Palli Rationing Scheme (recently dismantled due to its serious&#13;
problem of leakage). More recently, a Food for Education scheme has also been introduced. One of the&#13;
drawbacks of all these efforts is that they are currently not targeted based on nutritional vulnerability.&#13;
They are either national level investments (such as enhancing overall food production) or when they are&#13;
targeted, the selection criteria are generally landlessness, low income or destitution among women. While&#13;
these are reasonable proxy indicators of undernutrition, direct targeting based on nutritional criteria would&#13;
clearly be more precise, though operationally more difficult; also, in some schemes the targeting has been&#13;
to men, because these schemes have been designed around construction projects typically employing men.&#13;
Such projects are also limited by the fact that construction work is generally not carried out during&#13;
seasons when food insecurity is greatest. Another aspect of these programs which needs improvement&#13;
is to ensure that the food reaches the intended beneficiaries; leakage of varying degrees exists in all these&#13;
programs, since none of them carries out supervised on-the-spot feeding. Lastly, as discussed before,&#13;
income transfers do not necessarily translate into increased food consumption or improved nutrition, least&#13;
of all among the women and children, in view of the strong male decision-making tradition which is&#13;
universal in Bangladesh households, as in the rest of the region. Thus there is a clear need to reorient&#13;
and retarget some of these investments in food security if they were to have the desired nutritional&#13;
impact. The feasibility and cost-effectiveness of such nutritional targeting and reorientation need to be&#13;
ascertained.&#13;
1.17       The successes of green revolution technologies has led to more rice availability at lower&#13;
prices, with the potential for increased access to food for the poor. The time has come, therefore, to&#13;
focus national nutrition efforts on household feeding and caring practices; improvements in these practices&#13;
could help ensure full nutritional benefits of the said increase in food security.&#13;
1.18       The health and family welfare programs aim to provide primary health care and family&#13;
planning services to the rural communities through a network of Thana Health Complexes, Rural&#13;
Dispensaries and Union Health &amp; Family Welfare Centers. About 45% of the population have access&#13;
to some health care facilities albeit lacking in quality and consequently under-utilized. Since 1982, in an&#13;
effort to improve the access to the Health and family planning services, satellite clinics have been&#13;
organized by female field workers to provide a range of maternal and child health and family planning&#13;
services. Recent improvements in primary health care activities include: better management of diarrhea&#13;
with mothers being trained to prepare home-made oral rehydration solution and a successful Expanded&#13;
Program of Immunization with a coverage of more than 65 % of children with full immunization. The&#13;
contraceptive prevalence rate is about 45 %. Further improvements are needed in terms of access to more&#13;
effective and better quality health care, especially Maternal and child health, so as to make sure that the&#13;
health dimension of the nutritional pre-requisites is satisfactorily fulfilled.&#13;
1.19       In terms of water supply and sanitation, at present about 85 % of the households have access&#13;
to tube-well for drinking water compared to only 45 % in the 80's. However, around 46% use surface&#13;
water for domestic purposes. Open space is used by 84% of the households for waste disposal and less&#13;
than 10% use sanitary toilets. The challenge now is to educate the rural populations on appropriate&#13;
behaviors related to personal hygiene and environmental sanitation which in turn affect the health and&#13;
nutrition status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
1.20       To control vitamin A deficiency and its consequences, GOB instituted the Nutritional&#13;
Blindness Prevention Program in 1973. High potency Vitamin A capsules are distributed twice a year&#13;
to children 6 months to 6 years of age throughout the country. While this program is supposed to cover&#13;
the whole country, in practice less than half the children have received the benefit of this program.&#13;
Recently, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued a directive to combine vitamin A&#13;
supplementation with immunization services. This integration is expected to help increase the Vitamin&#13;
A coverage levels among young children. Ultimately, the solution to the problem of vitamin A deficiency&#13;
lies in increasing the availability and consumption of green leafy and yellow vegetables and fruits. The&#13;
Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council has developed a number of improved production technologies&#13;
in this regard. The Homestead Vegetable Production Program of Ministry of Agriculture is implemented&#13;
in 100 Thanas.&#13;
1.21       Through the satellite clinics pregnant women receive iron and folic acid tablets. A program&#13;
for the control of intestinal parasites has also been included under the Fourth Population and Health&#13;
Project, currently being financed by a consortium of donors led by IDA. The reduction of intestinal&#13;
parasites, particularly that of hook-worm infestation, would help control nutritional anemia. Options for&#13;
fortifying appropriate foods with iron and Vitamin A need to explored.&#13;
1.22       The long-term strategy to control iodine deficiency is through universal iodization of salt.&#13;
The required legal framework is in place but effective enforcement of the law is still a difficult challenge.&#13;
The Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation and the Bangladesh Standards and Testing&#13;
Institution are responsible for the production and quality control of iodized salt for purposes of marketing.&#13;
The iodized salt production is being undertaken with the support of the United Nations Children's Fund&#13;
(UNICEF) and under the Fourth Population and Health Project. To provide an immediate short-term&#13;
control measure against iodine deficiency disorders, GOB embarked on a campaign to administer&#13;
injectable iodine (lipiodol) in 1985. Thus far approximately 65% of the target population (males 0-15&#13;
years and females 0-45 years) have received the injection in 30 hyperendemic subdistricts. A proposal&#13;
to switch from injections to capsules has been shelved since the program is not expected to continue once&#13;
universal salt iodization is achieved.&#13;
1.23       A few Non-Government Organizations (NGO) have been active in the field of nutrition,&#13;
some directly, but most as part of their child care, health care or rural development activities. Most&#13;
notable of these are Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), Helen Keller International,&#13;
CARE and Save the Children Fund. In particular, a recent pilot intervention undertaken by BRAC in&#13;
one thana (Muktagacha) is very relevant to the approach being proposed in this project (para 1.38). By&#13;
virtue of their small size and their style of operations, NGOs have generally found it easier to promote&#13;
community empowerment and other innovations. Similarly, within their limited scope of activity, NGOs&#13;
have developed useful expertise and experience, and would be a significant resource to any major effort&#13;
against malnutrition. Particular areas where NGOs have been found to possess strong potential are:&#13;
community mobilization, training of field-level workers, quick field-testing of operational techniques,&#13;
development and delivery of Information, Education and Communication (IEC) messages, inter-sectoral&#13;
coordination (between the sectors that a given NGO is involved in), logistics of supplying commodities&#13;
on time and maintaining adequate stock levels and project management. Two limitations in relying on&#13;
NGOs for providing nutrition services are: (i) NGO presence covers a small part of rural Bangladesh and&#13;
their capacity is typically limited to activities in small well-defined areas; no one NGO could possibly&#13;
cover the whole of Bangladesh with an intensive nutrition program of the type envisaged; such a project&#13;
would have to be primarily a GOB venture, with the help of several interested NGOs in areas where this&#13;
is feasible; (ii) almost all the NGOs in Bangladesh are currently totally dependent on foreign assistance&#13;
and could simply collapse if and when such assistance is withdrawn; this raises concerns of sustainability,&#13;
unless GOB owns the project activities and is fully committed to their implementation with NGO support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
After a careful consideration of the benefits and risks, it was decided that active NGO participation would&#13;
be beneficial to the proposed project and is contemplated in a major way.&#13;
C. Main Issues in Nutritwon and the Government's Strategy&#13;
1.24        The place of nutrition in national development has long received less attention than it&#13;
deserves. The appreciation of the development consequences of malnutrition and its causation, and the&#13;
awareness of available solutions have, until recently, not been uniformly accurate or extensive among the&#13;
policy-makers and decision-makers of Bangladesh. Moreover, interventions impacting on nutrition status&#13;
have, of necessity, been scattered across various ministries and/or departments; these sectoral actions have&#13;
not been coordinated through a single agency responsible for nutrition. Though the Ministry of Health&#13;
and Family Welfare (MOHFW) has been formally identified by the Rules of Business as being responsible&#13;
for nutrition, it was not given a clear authority to coordinate nutrition-related actions across sectors.&#13;
Most activities impinging on nutrition have been carried out primarily with goals other than nutritionper&#13;
se: say, to improve agricultural production for economic reasons or to enhance food availability (not&#13;
necessarily to improve nutrition). This fact has meant that the agencies carrying out such programs were&#13;
not always aware of their nutritional import. As for MOHFW itself, its contribution to nutrition has been&#13;
mainly through the health dimension, e.g., control of childhood infections and provision of maternal care,&#13;
apart from a few specific micronutrient interventions. A comprehensive national program of nutrition&#13;
has so far not been embarked upon in spite of attempts to establish a "coordinated nutrition program"&#13;
under the Bangladesh National Nutrition Council and a "comprehensive nutrition project" under the&#13;
Institute of Public Health Nutrition; neither of these came to fruition because the institutions concerned&#13;
have lacked the necessary expertise or mandate. As a result, within the complex of nutrition issues,&#13;
substantial areas have remained unaddressed.&#13;
1.25       Incomplete understanding of the causation of malnutrition. As in most developing countries,&#13;
the predominant perception in Bangladesh has been that malnutrition is the result of poverty and&#13;
household food insecurity. The extent of poverty, landlessness, underemployment, population density&#13;
and proneness to natural disasters confirm and strengthen this perception. Some appreciation of the role&#13;
of health conditions in determining nutritional status has existed but there has been, until recently, very&#13;
little recognition of the third dimension, i.e., caring practices. This incomplete understanding of&#13;
determinants of malnutrition by politicians and policy-makers, and even by some nutritionists in&#13;
Bangladesh, has seriously skewed the country's efforts to combat malnutrition in the direction of tackling&#13;
poverty and food insecurity with no community-based interventions aimed at behavioral change. A&#13;
clearer analysis of causation of malnutrition would also lead to a better targeting of such interventions;&#13;
though malnutrition is highly prevalent among under-five children and to a significant extent among&#13;
school children and adults, the intervention that is likely to bring the most benefits would be that on&#13;
children 0-24 months and on women; such a targeting strategy was not adopted in Bangladesh prior to&#13;
this project's preparation.&#13;
1.26        Incomplete appreciation of the consequences of malnutrition. The magnitude and seriousness&#13;
of the implications of PEM as well as micro-nutrient deficiencies in terms of: a) infant, child and&#13;
maternal morbidity and mortality; b) the incomplete emotional, intellectual and cognitive development&#13;
of children, and their reduced ability to learn; and c) the lowered productivity of adults in the labor force,&#13;
were not fully appreciated. Besides, the fact that the burden of malnutrition on the health care system&#13;
leads to a drain on the economy has often been missed. Recent research results, showing that even the&#13;
so-called 'moderate' malnutrition has significant adverse effects on morbidity and mortality need to be&#13;
more widely known. Thus, while malnutrition is acknowledged to be widespread, its significance as a&#13;
constraint to national development has been thus far underestimated. Unless one focuses on the&#13;
development impact of malnutrition, particularly on the lower educability and productivity, the&#13;
opportunity costs of not investing in better nutrition are not obvious.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
1.27        Weak institutional base for nutrition.  Several institutes, councils and committees in&#13;
Bangladesh have been engaged in various nutrition-related activities. Examples of these institutions are:&#13;
the Bangladesh National Nutrition Council, the Institute of Public Health Nutrition, the Institute of&#13;
Nutrition and Food Sciences and the Institute of Food Sciences and Technology. But, for the most part,&#13;
the generally poor commitment to nutrition at higher levels has resulted in scant resources and a lack of&#13;
adequate staff for these institutions and limited exposure to global nutrition experiences has led to a less&#13;
than full development of local expertise; the roles and mandates of these institutions have been&#13;
overlapping with each other and unclear; none of them has been given sufficient authority or&#13;
responsibility for program implementation; they have not had much impact in increasing or rationalizing&#13;
investments to combat malnutrition, or in making current nutrition-related programs more effective. Until&#13;
recently therefore, insufficient advocacy has led to low awareness and commitment in turn resulting in&#13;
inadequate resources to build a constituency for nutrition in Bangladesh.&#13;
1.28        The nutrition investment gap. Much as the causation or consequences of malnutrition have&#13;
been ill-understood, there has been a lack of awareness about what could be done to prevent or reduce&#13;
malnutrition. A general sense of resignation has prevailed that until poverty is eradicated malnutrition&#13;
is bound to persist. Until recently, it was not recognized that investment in well-conceived nutrition&#13;
programs can have high returns and such recognition is still not universal. Besides the overall low&#13;
priority accorded to nutrition, there is a significant investment gap within nutrition. Investment has&#13;
focussed on achieving self-sufficiency in the basic staple foods (rice and, more recently, wheat); and on&#13;
food aid to "economically vulnerable groups" of population. While the value of such investments in&#13;
agriculture and food programs and health services and the continued need to strengthen and expand them&#13;
are unquestionable, there has been practically no investment in programs to improve caring practices at&#13;
the household level. One of the central issues sought to be addressed by this project is this investment&#13;
gap in the areas of caring practices. Caring practices would be improved through: education and&#13;
mobilization of communities to understand the causes and consequences of malnutrition and to enable&#13;
them to combat it; and the counseling of individual families so that the women eat better and young&#13;
children are fed better.&#13;
l&#13;
1.29       Inequitable and inefficient targeting of food programs. Since the late 1980s, much of the&#13;
monies spent on food aid, food subsidies, and food-for-work schemes in Bangladesh have been&#13;
inequitably targeted. 70-95 % of the US$60 million spent annually on the recently withdrawn rural ration&#13;
scheme, were estimated to have been lost by system leakage6. The remaining food programs operate at&#13;
an estimated annual cost of about US$ 250 million, not including the newly announced Food for&#13;
Education scheme. Considerable resources are also being spent on food subsidies for civil servants, the&#13;
police, and the military - population groups which are not necessarily the most food-insecure. Even&#13;
where food schemes are aimed at the disadvantaged, it has been impossible to target food aid at the&#13;
malnourished, because there is no institutionalized system to monitor the weight and growth of the&#13;
nutritionally vulnerable. Targeting has therefore often been based on estimates of income or landlessness,&#13;
characteristics that do not fully cover nutritional vulnerability.&#13;
1.30        Aside from inequities in targeting and related leakages, other factors in the design of many&#13;
food programs have affected their effectiveness in improving the nutrition of vulnerable groups. For&#13;
example, some programs benefit primarily men rather than the nutritionally more vulnerable women and&#13;
young children in their households. Most food-for-work schemes are related to the construction of roads,&#13;
culverts and bridges, on which work can only be undertaken in the dry season; yet the seasonal peaks&#13;
of malnutrition are mainly in the wet season when crops have not yet been harvested, diarrhea and&#13;
malaria peak, and energy expenditures on cultivation are greatest. A recent study by the International&#13;
6  Options for Targeting Food Interventions in Bangladesh. Report of The Working Group on Targeted Food&#13;
Interventions, chaired by International Food Policy Research Institute, 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
Food Policy Research Institute found the Vulnerable Group Development scheme to have the least amount&#13;
of leakage; however, even among the VGD beneficiary households, caloric adequacy among females&#13;
(especially pregnant and lactating women) was much lower than that among men7. The study also&#13;
concluded that there was no significant difference in the nutritional status of pre-school children between&#13;
program and control groups.&#13;
1.31       Malnutrition is a wider problem than starvation.  Equating nutrition with food, and&#13;
malnutrition with poverty is one of the commonest flaws in the understanding of nutrition issues. While&#13;
poverty leads to food insecurity resulting in starvation at the extreme, malnutrition affects people of&#13;
almost all income groups in Bangladesh (Tables 1.1 and 1.2). Being less dramatic than starvation,&#13;
malnutrition attracts less attention though it is a more pervasive problem. Food programs such as&#13;
Vulnerable Group Development are essential to address both the problems among the abjectly poor. But&#13;
they need to be complemented with community-based efforts at changing household behaviors, at the&#13;
heart of the problem of malnutrition among those who are relatively more food-secure as well. Such&#13;
community-based efforts would not deliver food aid in the sense of emergency relief for a limited group&#13;
of people in a disaster situation; but they would rather seek to address an endemic problem that prevails&#13;
even during "normal" times. Evidently Bangladesh needs both types of interventions - economically&#13;
targeted food aid to those in the extreme end of the poverty spectrum and nutritionally targeted activities&#13;
aimed at household behaviors; undoubtedly there would be population groups which would qualify for&#13;
both types of targeting. The two sets of interventions should work in close complementarity in order to&#13;
address the problem of malnutrition comprehensively.&#13;
1.32        Weak inter-sectoral focus on nutrition.  The different resources available in existing&#13;
programs for health, agricultural extension, soft credit, employment and income generation have not been&#13;
coordinated and focussed on nutrition, for at least four reasons. First, there has been no mechanism to&#13;
identify who, at the village level, is malnourished. Second, communities and local governments have not&#13;
perceived the seriousness of the malnutrition problem and have not been empowered to seek help from&#13;
the appropriate higher agencies. Third, improved nutrition has seldom been a priority at any level:&#13;
nutrition has been everybody's business, but nobody's responsibility.  Fourth, there has been no&#13;
institutional mechanism at the local level to bring agencies together, and no signals have been coming&#13;
from higher up in the system to encourage these agencies to work inter-sectorally at the field level.&#13;
1.33        Government commitment. Notwithstanding the issues raised in paras 1.24 to 1.32, more&#13;
recently there has been a recognition that investments in nutrition not only benefit the national economic&#13;
development but are an essential pre-requisite for it.  If the majority of Bangladeshi people are&#13;
undernourished and ill, the resultant loss of productivity can frustrate the investments in infrastructure&#13;
or industry aimed at building the economy. Recognizing the value of investing in human capital and in&#13;
order to mitigate the suffering caused by malnutrition, GOB has included nutritional goals as part of its&#13;
Fourth Five Year Plan, ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child and reaffirmed its commitment&#13;
to these goals at the International Conference on Nutrition in Rome (1992). The close and continued&#13;
involvement of the Planning Commission and the Prime Minister's Office in the development of a&#13;
national nutrition program demonstrates GOB's appreciation of the macro-economic and inter-sectoral&#13;
framework within which nutrition must be dealt with. GOB has included the project in its Three Year&#13;
Rolling Investment Program and intends to make adequate budgetary provisions for the project in the&#13;
Annual Development Plan from FY96 onwards. GOB has formally sought IDA's assistance for its&#13;
nutrition efforts.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
D. Role of international agencies other than IDA&#13;
1.34       In the past, there has been a remarkable similarity between the investments in nutrition by&#13;
international development partners and those by GOB, in that they display a comparable lack of&#13;
investment in efforts at changing household behaviors related to caring practices. A possible reason is&#13;
that donors have been reluctant to put monies into areas where they did not see strong GOB commitment.&#13;
Thus, the foreign aid relating to nutrition have generally been on food, family planning and health, with&#13;
the exception of some support to micronutrient programns. One of the goals of foreign assistance has been&#13;
to rationalize total development investment in the country through the policy dialogue that ensues from&#13;
such assistance; and such policy dialogue in respect of nutrition has been developing in the past two years&#13;
between GOB and its development partners, primarily UNICEF and IDA in the context of this project.&#13;
UNICEF has been providing considerable financial and technical support to the salt iodization program&#13;
in Bangladesh. The United Nations Development Program has been coordinating the efforts of UN&#13;
agencies involved in Nutrition, which were primarily directed at food aid, managed by the World Food&#13;
Program. The World Health Organization (WHO) and FAO have made limited attempts to develop some&#13;
programs. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has supported, through&#13;
Hellen Keller International, some nutritional surveillance activities.&#13;
1.35       GOB's participation in the International Conference on Nutrition in Rome (1992) and the&#13;
subsequent preparation of this project have been accompanied by an increased awareness of and interest&#13;
in nutrition issues on the part of GOB and some donors: Asian Development Bank, FAO, Germany - both&#13;
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) and Deutsche Gessellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ)&#13;
-United Nations Development Program, United Nations Population Fund and WHO.&#13;
E. Rationale for IDA's involvement&#13;
1.36       Relevance to Country Assistance Strategy. The project is fully in line with IDA's Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy for Bangladesh8, discussed by the Executive Directors on February 17, 1994, in&#13;
which human resources development aspects are seen as crucial to achieving the over-arching national&#13;
goal of poverty alleviation (para 34 of the Strategy paper). Improving nutritional status of women and&#13;
children is a critical objective of national development, without which the investments made by GOB,&#13;
IDA and other development partners, in health, family planning, education and women's development&#13;
are unlikely to yield their full benefits. The Strategy (para 35) specifically recognizes the IDA assistance&#13;
to GOB in preparing this community-based project involving the participation of NGOs.&#13;
1.37       Though substantial investments are being made on food and health programs, there is no&#13;
other source of significant financing currently available to Bangladesh for a community-based nutrition&#13;
program and without IDA support to this project, malnutrition is not likely to be addressed&#13;
comprehensively in the foreseeable future. IDA has been actively involved in the health and population&#13;
sector of Bangladesh and its entry into nutrition would produce beneficial synergies. Through its proven&#13;
ability to engage GOB in a policy dialogue in the sector, IDA is in a unique position to assist it in&#13;
nutrition. IDA's extensive experience with nutrition projects worldwide and its familiarity with the&#13;
malnutrition issues specific to Bangladesh (thanks to a sector study in 1985 and to subsequent project&#13;
preparation activities) enable IDA to provide the necessary leadership for a concerted action against&#13;
malnutrition. The implementation experience with IDA-supported population and health projects has been&#13;
positive and there is a good likelihood that a nutrition project under MOHFW would prove successful.&#13;
The project takes account of the experience under the Fourth Population and Health Project. several&#13;

1.38         The experience gained in BRAC's pilotproject. Fashioned after the Bank-financed Tamil&#13;
Nadu Integrated Nutrition Project, BRAC has been implementing for over two years, a Community Based&#13;
Pilot Nutrition Initiative in one Thana, i.e., Muktagacha. Covering an estimated population of 156,000&#13;
including 5,000 under-two children, 20,000 women of child-bearing age and 5,000 adolescent girls, that&#13;
project's main strategy is Growth Monitoring and Promotion (GMP)9 with intensive IEC efforts by a&#13;
dedicated grass-roots level worker. This worker is a married woman with a minimum of eight years of&#13;
schooling and permanently residing in the village with an inclination to work for the community. One&#13;
such worker per village, selected through community mobilization efforts, undertakes GMP and tasks&#13;
such as registering pregnancies, births and deaths, imparting health and nutrition education, conducting&#13;
women's group meetings and making daily household visits to look into the health and nutritional needs&#13;
of the community, especially the vulnerable group, i.e., women and children. Initial evaluation reports&#13;
of the BRAC's project have shown that such community-based strategy is feasible and that tangible&#13;
improvements have been made in the nutritional status of children and women included in the program&#13;
(80% of under-two children where covered by GMP and 73% of the children graduating from the&#13;
program showed weight gain); most significantly BRAC's experience has shown that improved caring&#13;
practices have resulted from the community-based interventions. Important lessons learnt from BRAC's&#13;
pilot activities have been incorporated in this Project's design (Annex 1) and operational lessons emerging&#13;
from the Project itself will also be taken account of as it is implemented in a phased manner (para 2.37).&#13;
1.39        Lessons from Bank's Involvement in Nutrition in Other Countries. Although this would be&#13;
the Bank's first nutrition project in Bangladesh, the Bank's experience in several other countries, e.g.,&#13;
India (Tamil Nadu), Indonesia, Guinea-Bissau and Colombia as gleaned from their Project Completion&#13;
Reports and OED evaluations, have yielded valuable lessons for the design of the Bangladesh project.&#13;
Some of the most important of these lessons are: the feasibility of community-based interventions like&#13;
growth monitoring, targeted food supplementation and nutrition IEC, the need for a strong political&#13;
commitment and the involvement of GOB in project preparation, the inter-sectoral nature of the problem&#13;
which calls for an inter-sectoral solution, the essential characteristics of the field workers, their minimum&#13;
required numerical strength and the necessity for their good training and very close supervision of the&#13;
labor-intensive tasks of community-based nutrition interventions. Based on these lessons, the project&#13;
proposes to lay the greatest emphasis on such community-based interventions, suggests careful targeting&#13;
based on field tests, will test two ratios of community Nutrition Promoters (CNP) to the population they&#13;
serve - one per 1,000 and one per 1,500 population - and provides for two supervisory personnel for&#13;
every 20 CNPs, includes field-based training of volunteers rather than an institution-based approach,&#13;
includes a strong IEC component, stresses monitoring and evaluation, includes a mid-term review to&#13;
allow mid-course corrections to operational strategies and contemplates a specific inter-sectoral program&#13;
development with the innovative idea of setting up an Inter-sectoral Nutrition Fund (ISNF) to encourage&#13;
agencies other than MOHFW to undertake nutritionally oriented programs within their respective sectors.&#13;
Annex 1 presents the lessons from earlier Bank projects on nutrition, which have been incorporated into&#13;
this project.&#13;
9 Growth Monitoring and Promotion (GMP) has evolved into one of the standard approaches in malnutrition control.&#13;
This approach involves regular weighing of children, charting the weights against the child's age, on a standard&#13;
growth chart to monitor his/her weight gains compared with established norms and taking appropriate action if the&#13;
growth falters. The action to be taken would include nutrition counseling of the mother (or alternative care-taker as&#13;
the case may be) and could include supplementary feeding of the child.&#13;

II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
2.1         This project is the first attempt by GOB to develop a comprehensive and coordinated&#13;
program to reduce malnutrition among its people. In the past, there have been smaller, isolated programs&#13;
or activities directed at specific micronutrient problems, some not-so-small programs aiming to improve&#13;
the food availability for the under-privileged sections of the society, either directly or by increasing their&#13;
incomes and the broad array of activities constituting the country's health program. All these contribute&#13;
to better nutrition but are not nearly enough by themselves, as evidenced by the serious state of&#13;
malnutrition obtaining currently in Bangladesh (para 1.2 to 1.7). GOB has recognized that investment&#13;
in the nutrition of its people is an important contribution to the human resources capital of the country&#13;
and is committed to making this investment adequate and appropriate and to optimize its returns. This&#13;
project is the beginning of a long-term effort eventually aiming to benefit the whole country, realizing&#13;
the aspirations of GOB as expressed at the International Conference on Nutrition held in Rome in&#13;
December, 1992 and at the World Summit for Children of 1990.&#13;
B. The Conceptual Basis&#13;
2.2         Malnutrition is a significant cause of ill-health, faltering physical growth, reduced mental&#13;
abilities, loss of productivity and death. Therefore it is a serious impediment to national socioeconomic&#13;
development as well as a major cause of pain and suffering. The attainment of good nutritional status&#13;
requires that three essential sets of conditions be met: (i) conditions which ensure the availability of&#13;
adequate and appropriate food at the household level; (ii) conditions that lead to good health, particularly&#13;
freedom from childhood infectious diseases such as measles, respiratory infections and diarrhoea and&#13;
intestinal parasitic infestations; and (iii) appropriate behaviors, collectively known as caring practices in&#13;
terms of eating, feeding, hygiene and health-related behaviors, and psycho-social aspects at the household&#13;
level, especially as applied to women and young children. All these determinants of nutritional status are&#13;
closely related to socioeconomic and cultural factors which play a crucial role in whether or not a given&#13;
people are well-nourished.&#13;
2.3         While poverty is a principal cause of household food insecurity and therefore an underlying&#13;
cause of under-nutrition, studies in Bangladesh show that lack of good nutrition is not exclusively&#13;
prevalent in the poor households (para 1.10). Increasing household incomes is likely to increase food&#13;
availability for the family, though not necessarily concomitantly; moreover, the appropriateness of the&#13;
food choice and intra-household food distribution particularly as relevant to women and young children&#13;
would not be addressed by increasing incomes alone. Though successful poverty alleviation is perhaps&#13;
the long-term solution to many of the problems of poor families (including malnutrition), it would take&#13;
considerable time and resources to achieve. A study'" on poverty and basic needs had estimated that it&#13;
would take 79 years to eliminate the average energy deficit in the lowest decile of the Bangladeshi&#13;
population, if the country's per capita income grew at the rate of 1.5% and the food prices remained&#13;
unchanged. On the other hand, effective nutrition projects have demonstrated that, in the shorter-term,&#13;
significant improvements could be made in nutritional status, without waiting for poverty alleviation&#13;
efforts to bear fruit. In fact, such nutritional status improvements would contribute considerably to&#13;
poverty alleviation goals by enhancing the learning capacity and productivity of the population. Thus the&#13;
concept behind this project is to view nutritional improvement as a means of poverty alleviation rather&#13;
than as its result.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
2.4         Ensuring good nutrition is generally a multi-sectoral responsibility due to the multiplicity&#13;
of its determinants. As an outcome it falls within the purview of the health sector, but clearly cannot be&#13;
dealt with by a ministry of health alone in any country. Agriculture, Food, Education, Social Welfare,&#13;
Women's Affairs, Environment (water supply and sanitation, in particular) are just some of the other key&#13;
sectors involved. Depending on how these sectoral responsibilities are configured within a given country,&#13;
even a greater number of ministries could be contributing directly or indirectly to the nutritional status&#13;
of its people. This multi-sectoral nature of nutrition frequently leads to a lack of clarity on who is&#13;
responsible within a government to ensure good nutrition. Generally therefore, the various efforts by the&#13;
sectors concerned are largely uncoordinated. Thus any comprehensive nutrition program ought to make&#13;
a conscious effort to bring together the activities of all the relevant sectors. This project incorporates this&#13;
concept through its inter-sectoral component.&#13;
2.5         Of the three groups of conditions which determine good nutrition, the third group, which&#13;
encompasses caring practices, deserves a special elaboration, firstly because it is frequently neglected and&#13;
secondly because it is here that tangible and sustainable impact can be made without major improvements&#13;
in socio-economic situation or in the effectiveness of the health care system. The action required in this&#13;
area is less about service delivery but more about behavioral change; it is not about creating dependence&#13;
but about empowering people to help themselves. This fact makes it more difficult for a system to handle&#13;
caring practices from a traditional service delivery approach - unlike food security and health which are&#13;
usually addressed through respective services. But it is this same fact that makes its benefits more&#13;
lasting, once the desirable behavioral changes have been brought about. For such changes to occur the&#13;
project proposes to begin by understanding and reinforcing the current coping strategies which the people&#13;
have successfully evolved over time in the face of adverse conditions; effective community mobilization&#13;
would be the key to the success of this strategy. Encouraged by a few successes elsewhere, including&#13;
in Bank-financed projects, the project proposes to focus primarily on this area of caring practices, while&#13;
simultaneously facilitating and strengthening the efforts already being made to address the other two&#13;
areas, namely, food security and health conditions. Section E describes the project components.&#13;
C. Objectives and Targets&#13;
2.6         The project seeks to initiate a national program of nutrition. The ultimate goal of the&#13;
national program would be to reduce malnutrition in Bangladesh to the extent that it ceases to be a public&#13;
health problem and to improve the nutritional status of its population, particularly children under five&#13;
years, women and adolescent girls. This long-term goal is sought to be reached through the following&#13;
three intermediate objectives:&#13;
(a)   to improve the capacity of national level nutrition institutions in Bangladesh in the areas of&#13;
advocacy, analysis of causation and consequences of malnutrition, policy advice, operational&#13;
research, and operational support of national programs;&#13;
(b)   to improve the capacity of communities, households and individuals in the project area to&#13;
understand their nutritional problems in practical terms and take appropriate action to&#13;
address them at their own level; and&#13;
(c)   to improve the nutritional status of the population in the project area, with particular&#13;
emphasis on pregnant and lactating women and on children.&#13;
2.7         The nutritional impact goal would be measured mainly on the basis of the following&#13;
quantitative targets to be reached after five years of Community-Based Nutrition Component (CBNC),&#13;
-he geographical coverage of which would be phased in (thanas to be selected as per agreed criteria, set&#13;
Out in annex 2):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
(a)   reduction of severe malnutrition by 40% and moderate malnutrition by 25 % as measured&#13;
by weight-for-age, among under-two children;&#13;
(b)   restoration of rate of growth, as measured by monthly weight-gain, among at least 50% of&#13;
under-two children included in GMP;&#13;
(c)   reduction of disorders resulting from  vitamin A  and iodine deficiency and their&#13;
consequences by half; and&#13;
(d)   reduction of iron-deficiency anaemia among children and pregnant and lactating women by&#13;
a third.&#13;
For those thanas where malnourished pregnant women will also be included in the supplementary feeding&#13;
program, the following additional targets will be set:&#13;
(e)   reduction of low birth-weight occurrence by half of the baseline level;&#13;
(f)  improvement in maternal weight gain by at least 50% in at least 50% of the pregnant&#13;
women;&#13;
2.8         More detailed quantitative targets based on appropriate indicators to measure inputs, process,&#13;
outputs and outcomes are being developed (para 2.23). While outcome and impact evaluation would be&#13;
carried out at the end of the project, progress during the project would be monitored through a nutrition&#13;
surveillance system. In addition, process indicators would be used, some of which would be:&#13;
(a)   Registration and nutritional screening of 50% of pregnant women by the end of the first&#13;
trimester;&#13;
(b)   registration of 80% of 0-24 month children; and&#13;
(c)   80%  of registered children receive at least 18 out of 24 monthly weighings, charted&#13;
accurately on their weight charts.&#13;
2.9        In addition to the direct nutritional impact targets stated in para 2.7, the project would&#13;
contribute to the national goals of reducing infant mortality from 110 to 55 per 1,000 live births and&#13;
reducing maternal mortality from 600 to 300 per 100,000 births by the year 2000.&#13;
D. Strategies&#13;
2.10        The main strategies which the project proposes to adopt are based on considerations of cost-&#13;
effectiveness and long-term sustainability of project benefits. The project takes a holistic view of&#13;
malnutrition causality and seeks to set in place a comprehensive national nutrition program that covers&#13;
the three groups of factors, namely, food, health and caring practices. A careful look at the programs&#13;
already in operation and cost-effectiveness considerations dictate that existing suboptimal investments on&#13;
a given set of activities must first be optimized and rationalized before additional resources are spent on&#13;
the same activities; in other words new investments must be made only on activities which are critical&#13;
to the project goals and show a clear investment gap. This analysis has led to the decision that the project&#13;
funds would primarily be spent on the area of caring practices while simultaneous support is given to the&#13;
optimization of existing investments in food and health through inter-sectoral action. Thus, the project's&#13;
focus on the community-based approach directed at caring practices is in fact part of a well-rounded&#13;
strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
2.11        Cost-effectiveness considerations have played an important role in the choice of the target&#13;
population group for the community-based nutrition component: GMP would be an expensive approach&#13;
if applied to all the children and therefore the target group for GMP has been chosen carefully, namely&#13;
children under two years of age, since combating malnutrition in these groups is most likely to yield the&#13;
maximum lasting benefits (which would eventually be enjoyed by a larger part of the population as these&#13;
children grow) at reasonable costs. As for the pregnant and lactating women, they are included in&#13;
supplementary feeding in similar projects elsewhere, and the nutritional benefits of such approach have&#13;
been shown but the literature is silent on the cost-effectiveness of such an approach. Therefore,&#13;
supplementary feeding of pregnant and lactating women will be undertaken on an experimental basis for&#13;
the first two years, with adequate budgetary provision to expand into all thanas subject to an evaluation&#13;
of the experience in these two years; pregnant and lactating women will of course be included in all&#13;
thanas for IEC activities. An alternative, even more selective, targeting strategy will be tested to try and&#13;
reduce costs further; this strategy would select newly married couples and their first child until its age&#13;
of two, with other severely malnourished children included through periodic screening. Being an&#13;
innovative targeting strategy not evaluated elsewhere it will be tried out in just one thana during this&#13;
project.&#13;
2.12       The rationale for choosing targeted GMP as the central strategy for CBNC is that it is the&#13;
best known technique, which could be used effectively to demonstrate to the mothers (or alternative care-&#13;
takers in the family, as the case may be) the effect of appropriate feeding practices on childhood growth.&#13;
While growth monitoring alone is of doubtful value in improving nutritional status, combined with the&#13;
carefully targeted, and supervised supplementary feeding with a strong element of counseling [the P&#13;
(promotion) in GMP], it has been proven to be of significant nutritional impact. Moreover, the&#13;
promotion part could serve as the locus for community mobilization leading to community awareness and&#13;
action as well as for inter-sectoral synergies at the grass-root level. In the long run, such community&#13;
movement could become a vehicle for other social sector activities: the women who meet everyday at the&#13;
nutrition center would have an opportunity to discuss other issues germane to their own needs.&#13;
2.13       It is the sustainability consideration that led to the basic approach of this project, namely&#13;
helping people help themselves, through behavioral change rather than a long-term dependence on food&#13;
aid. This theme is at the heart of CBNC, which relies totally on community action and changes in&#13;
household behavior brought about through interpersonal IEC to sustain nutritional benefits. It is also the&#13;
basis of the component on institution building, which seeks to develop national capacity to address&#13;
malnutrition so as to reduce dependence on foreign technical assistance. The project also seeks to&#13;
heighten general awareness of the problem and its solutions at political, policy and decision levels, in&#13;
order to ensure continued GOB commitment to the program, which is clearly a crucial element of&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
2.14        The project strategies which have been formulated based on the above reasoning may be&#13;
summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)   Supporting the formulation of a clear national nutrition program backed by strong political&#13;
commitment to implementing it;&#13;
(b)   Strengthening the national level institutional capacity to direct and coordinate nutrition&#13;
activities effectively and to develop effective monitoring mechanisms;&#13;
(c)   Facilitating existing and innovative efforts by various sectors to ensure adequate household&#13;
food security, access to quality health care services, sanitation and safe water supply;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
(d)   Effecting positive changes in caring practices related to eating, feeding and personal health&#13;
at the household level, focusing on pregnant and lactating women and children under two&#13;
years of age;&#13;
(e)   Promoting people's involvement in dealing with their problems of malnutrition, to ensure&#13;
sustainability; and&#13;
(f)   Strengthening existing nutrition activities, particularly oriented towards the control of&#13;
micronutrient deficiencies.&#13;
E. Project Description&#13;
2.15       The project would have three components.&#13;
(a)   National Level Nutrition Activities (US$19.0 million) with four sub-components:&#13;
(i) Program Development and Institution Building (US$2.7 million)&#13;
(ii) IEC Development (US$4.4 million)&#13;
(iii) Strengthening Existing Nutrition Activities. (US$6.4 million)&#13;
(iv) Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. (US$5.5 million)&#13;
(b)   Community-Based Nutrition Component (CBNC) (US$32.6 million).&#13;
(c)  Inter-Sectoral Nutrition Program Development (US$7.0 million).&#13;
National Level Nutrition Activities (US$19.0 million)&#13;
2.16       Program  Development and Institution Building.  The component will support the&#13;
development of an effective national nutrition program to translate the aspirations expressed at the&#13;
International Conference on Nutrition (Rome, 1992) and the World Summit for Children (1990),&#13;
undertake advocacy at the highest policy levels, maintain high political commitment and coordinate the&#13;
development of national expertise to tackle malnutrition. The roles of institutions already working on&#13;
different aspects of nutrition will be reviewed, streamlined and coordinated in the overall national context,&#13;
with a view to ensuring complementarity among their activities. The review will also assess specific&#13;
areas which need strengthening and recommend appropriate resources to effect the required strengthening.&#13;
This will also include the role of NGOs and their future place in the national nutrition program beyond&#13;
this project. The component will also provide funds for policy research and operations research relevant&#13;
to nutrition. Training and fellowships will be arranged for selected staff so as to update their knowledge&#13;
and skills. Annex 3 contains a more detailed description of this component. Agreements were reached&#13;
during negotiations with GOB that by December 31, 1996, a review of the major national level&#13;
institutions active in nutrition or related fields in the country will be carried out acceptable to IDA,&#13;
that the results of the review will be furnished to IDA for comments and that the recommendations&#13;
of the review, taking account of IDA's comments, will be carried out.&#13;
2.17       Information, Education and Communication (IEC) Development.  IEC is the central&#13;
philosophy of CBNC. Most of IEC delivery under the project will be done through CBNC. However,&#13;
since the development of IEC messages and materials is a substantial task unto itself and since some&#13;
advocacy and mass media campaigns would be carried out separately from CBNC, these activities have&#13;
been grouped as a distinct component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
2.18       The development of appropriate nutrition IEC messages and material would be coordinated&#13;
at the national level by a separate unit which would be established as part of the Project Office under&#13;
MOHFW. This unit will be headed by a Deputy Director supported by a few technical staff. The terms&#13;
of reference (TOR) of the IEC unit will be subject to review by IDA, as part of the TOR for the whole&#13;
Project Office. Audience research to understand fully the cultural and behavioral aspects relevant to&#13;
nutrition, and to assess IEC needs is the first step and such research has already been initiated. Message&#13;
development and the production of IEC materials would follow the results of the formative research as&#13;
part of the project. These activities would be contracted out to private firms who have proven expertise&#13;
in IEC message development. A more detailed description of this component is provided in annex 4.&#13;
2.19       Strengthening Existing Nutrition Activities. This component seeks to improve the coverage&#13;
and effectiveness of existing programs which directly address different types of malnutrition: i.e.,&#13;
Campaign for the Protection and Promotion of Breast-Feeding, Vitamin A distribution, iron and folate&#13;
tablet provision to pregnant women and control of iodine deficiency disorders. Since these programs are&#13;
in place in most parts of the country, this component will not be limited to the sites chosen for CBNC;&#13;
however, particular attention would be paid to CBNC sites to ensure the attainment of measurable&#13;
nutritional impact (targets stipulated in para 2.7). Besides direct interventions such as Vitamin A&#13;
distribution, this component will work closely with homestead gardening programs and with the IEC&#13;
component to ensure that appropriate messages are included on foods rich in micronutrients.&#13;
2.20       Specifically, the component will finance the following activities: strengthening the program&#13;
on control of anemia, supporting breast-feeding, including the "Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative";&#13;
improving operational efficiency of Vitamin A (it has been estimated that there are no resource gaps for&#13;
the commodities themselves); establishing mechanisms to test the quality of iodized salt produced in the&#13;
country and to make sure that the legal requirements are fulfilled (preventing the marketing of non-&#13;
iodized salt); and promoting the consumption of iodized salt and foods rich in vitamins and minerals&#13;
through specific IEC activities. Annex 5 provides a more detailed description of this component.&#13;
2.21       Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation.  Effective monitoring is especially&#13;
significant in the context of the proposed project, for two reasons: (i) the core program approach is new&#13;
for Bangladesh and (ii) the implementation responsibility for the project activities (especially the inter-&#13;
sectoral ones) is spread out between various ministries/departments and some NGOs. Therefore a careful&#13;
and tight system of monitoring is being included. Annex 6 gives a more detailed description of the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation system planned under the project.&#13;
2.22       Baseline surveys will be conducted in each of the CBNC thanas and in comparable control&#13;
thanas as the first field activities so as to obtain a pre-project picture of nutritional status, as relevant to&#13;
the project objectives. The unit of baseline surveys would be the thana, though information would also&#13;
be made available on union and village levels from service statistics of the project. The baseline surveys&#13;
are an important step and would involve all parties concerned (not least of all, the community) at various&#13;
levels. Baseline data are also being gathered on behaviors as part of IEC formative research. The&#13;
planned review of national level agencies and institutions active in nutrition in Bangladesh should provide&#13;
the baseline information necessary for the evaluation of the component on program development and&#13;
institution building. To reduce the noise from secular trends while evaluating achievements over time,&#13;
the surveys will include control thanas; the nutrition surveillance system set up by Hellen Keller&#13;
International will also be established in a sample of the project thanas to provide comparative data for&#13;
intervention and control areas. Surveys in the six first-year thanas and two control thanas have already&#13;
been initiated with UNICEF assistance.&#13;
2.23        Continuous monitoring of the project as well as a mid-term evaluation at the end of three&#13;
years will be based on a predetermined set of indicators which measure inputs and process as well as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
outputs and outcomes. Long-term impact (on productivity, learning capacity and economic development)&#13;
will not be feasible to measure within the project's life; but outcomes in terms of nutritional improvement&#13;
will be measured. Annex 6 includes an initial list of suggested indicators, in addition to the key&#13;
indicators listed in para 2.7 and 2.8. Further expansion of the project beyond the first three years, will&#13;
take account of results from the mid-term evaluation. In addition, annual reviews have been provided&#13;
for, including semi-annual IDA-UNICEF joint supervision missions. The annual review at the end of&#13;
two years will be of special importance; the experience from the first six CBNC thanas will be carefully&#13;
evaluated at that time in order to learn lessons for the subsequent expansion as per the planned phasing&#13;
of CBNC.&#13;
2.24       The responsibility for monitoring and evaluation would be vested in the respective&#13;
implementing ministries/departments/NGOs for individual project components. The overall monitoring&#13;
and evaluation will be carried out by the Project Office with the technical assistance of a Management&#13;
and Technical Support Team. Agreements were reached during Negotiations with GOB that baseline&#13;
surveys will be carried out in each project thana before CBNC activities are started, that by June&#13;
30, 1998, a mid-term evaluation will be conducted by independent professional experts in&#13;
accordance with TOR satisfactory to IDA; that a review system will be established and carried out,&#13;
providing progress reports to IDA at semi-annual supervision missions.&#13;
Community-Based Nutrition Component (CBNC) (US$32.6 million)&#13;
2.25       This is the core component of the project and is described in fuller detail in annex 7. The&#13;
first activity under this component will be community mobilization, which would involve: the formation&#13;
of women's groups (and/or interacting with any existing ones) and building a rapport with them; learning&#13;
the specific local context as relevant to the proposed project activities; identifying a suitable woman&#13;
meeting agreed selection criteria and acceptable to the community for selection as CNP; determining the&#13;
appropriate mechanism for the procurement of raw materials, preparation, packaging and delivery of&#13;
supplementary food; agreeing on a suitable location for the Community Nutrition Center (CNC) which&#13;
will be the center of operations (see para 2.32). The central activity of this component is GMP with a&#13;
strong element of IEC. This involves regular monthly weighing of children to monitor their growth and&#13;
using this process to counsel mothers by showing them when there is a problem and what to do about it.&#13;
It also entails very selective and targeted supplementary feeding of very vulnerable children and women,&#13;
who meet nutritional criteria. The supplementary feeding is primarily intended as a demonstrative tool&#13;
to provide counseling to the mothers, and secondarily to help the severely malnourished children recover.&#13;
It is not intended to replace the normal food which the children get at home. The food will be a snack&#13;
which is easy to prepare from a pre-cooked food base. It will not be distributed on a take-home basis&#13;
but will be fed to the malnourished women and children at feeding centers at a time of the day which is&#13;
different from the usual meal time; this approach of on-site feeding provides the opportunity for&#13;
counseling and ensures that the food is actually consumed by the intended beneficiaries. The CNC itself&#13;
may eventually become the community forum where the women meet regularly and build a community&#13;
action program, not just for nutrition but for a broader range of welfare efforts.&#13;
2.26       Minimizing leakage offood. Though supplementary feeding is being proposed primarily as&#13;
an educational tool and the project is neither designed as nor intended to become a feeding program, per&#13;
se, since considerable amounts of food supplements are involved, careful thought was given to minimizing&#13;
leakage to unintended persons. The following specific safeguards have been built into the Project design&#13;
in this regard: on-site supervised feeding strategy; the special composition of the food supplement, which&#13;
renders it less amenable to sale in the open market; close supervision of the project activities by NGO(s);&#13;
and decentralized procurement of food supplements, which brings the process closer to the community&#13;
thus making it more transparent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
2.27        The project will try two different targeting approaches for CBNC:&#13;
(a)  the general targeting strategy: children under two years will come under Growth Monitoring,&#13;
severely malnourished and growth faltering children under two years (meeting criteria based&#13;
on weight-for-age charts) and malnourished pregnant mothers (meeting criteria based on mid-&#13;
arm circumference) would be brought into the supplementary feeding program. Selected&#13;
children will be fed ad libitum, with an estimated average portion of 300 Kcal/day, six days a&#13;
week for a period of 4 months and mothers, a 600 Kcal portion everyday for 4 months during&#13;
pregnancy and 6 months into lactation. The supplementary feeding of pregnant and lactating&#13;
women will be undertaken in 3 of the 6 first-year thanas and the experience in those thanas&#13;
compared with the other two at the end of two years before expanding to all the project thanas.&#13;
Besides active IEC and nutrition demonstrations, an effort will be made to provide access to&#13;
adequate primary health care (through existing health/family planning infrastructure) with an&#13;
emphasis on Maternal and child health and a coordinated package of inter-sectoral services&#13;
(such as homestead gardening, female education, income generation activities, etc.) relevant to&#13;
nutrition with special attention to the households with people belonging to the target group; and&#13;
(b)  an experimental targeting strategy (to be tested as a pilot in one thana): all newly married&#13;
couples in the covered area will be provided a special package of health and welfare services&#13;
(the services under GOB's health program directed at the general population are not at adequate&#13;
levels of quality, access and completeness):  IEC, with a particularly strong nutritional&#13;
counseling focusing on the period from pregnancy to two years after child-birth, preferential&#13;
treatment at health/family planning facilities with an emphasis on maternal and child health care&#13;
and particular attention to childhood infections, inclusion in homestead gardening program,&#13;
special provision to their household in terms of access to safe water supply and sanitary&#13;
facilities, etc. The couples' first pregnancy will get extra attention, including supplementary&#13;
feeding of the mother and/or the child if they meet nutritional criteria, full pre-, intra- and post-&#13;
natal care, breast-feeding promotion, complete immunization (for the mother and the child).&#13;
The couples will leave the program when the first child is two years old (at that time, if the&#13;
child is in the supplementary feeding program, the child would stay in and complete it). This&#13;
strategy is expected to get the attention of the young women and men when they are most&#13;
receptive to counseling and it is hoped that eating/feeding behaviors inculcated in them would&#13;
be sustained. An added advantage of this targeting strategy is that it would reduce the number&#13;
of beneficiaries which one community worker needs to take care of. Moreover, the fact that&#13;
the couple is eligible for the package only until the first child is two years old might serve as&#13;
an incentive to postpone the first pregnancy, a useful contribution to the national goal of fertility&#13;
reduction. Lastly, in the cultural context of Bangladesh, the newly-married couples are seen&#13;
as beginning their lives and therefore looked upon favorably; this makes such a targeting&#13;
strategy locally acceptable.&#13;
2.28        If done effectively, CBNC will change the household feeding and eating behaviors in a&#13;
positive way. When the load of severe malnutrition is reduced sufficiently in a given site and when&#13;
adequate behavioral change has been brought about, this component could be phased out gradually. It&#13;
is difficult to predict precisely the time required to reach that stage but a rough estimate would be 10-15&#13;
years of operations. Following such a period, the communities themselves could then carry on the&#13;
essential aspects of GMP, without a need for project inputs; regular weighings of children could continue&#13;
by community volunteers and when malnourished children are identified, they could be referred to the&#13;
health services (which would not be overburdened by such cases if the level of malnutrition is not as high&#13;
as it currently is). Such community take-over of nutrition activities has occurred in Indonesia. The&#13;
project would involve the local governmnent representatives (Union Parishad, Thana Development&#13;
Committee, etc.) to ensure their participation and ownership of the project activities. The high degree&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
of NGO participation in project activities (see para 4.4) would further enhance the possibility of&#13;
community ownership.&#13;
2.29         Growth Monitoring  is the only reliable way to identify children who are severely&#13;
malnourished or falling behind in growth. When combined with the task of growth promotion, i.e.,&#13;
supervising the supplementary feeding and carrying out subsequent counseling, this is a labor-intensive&#13;
task. From experience in similar projects elsewhere, e.g., Tamil Nadu, India, it is known that one&#13;
community-level worker per 1,000 population would need to work for about 4 hours a day, for six days&#13;
a week. In order to assess the worker population ratio required in the Bangladesh context, the project&#13;
will try two ratios: 1 per 1,000 and 1 per 1,500 in the first two years. The final ratio to be adopted will&#13;
depend on a review after two years. Such a worker has to be from within the community and well-&#13;
accepted by the people of the community. In the cultural context of Bangladesh, such a worker has to&#13;
be a woman with healthy and well-nourished children of her own, so that she could serve as a model&#13;
mother. The workers also need to have a minimum education of 8th grade. In this project, such workers&#13;
are proposed to be called Community Nutrition Promoters (CNP). Their immediate supervision will be&#13;
provided by Community Nutrition Organizers (CNO), who will be stationed at the Union level in the ratio&#13;
of 1 per 10 CNPs and further up the system, the project would have a Thana Nutrition Coordinator at&#13;
the Thanas level to oversee all CBNC activities in the given Thana. The vital need for adequate training&#13;
of these workers and their intensive supervision for the successful implementation of this project has been&#13;
recognized and detailed plans for such training and supervision have been prepared as part of the Project&#13;
Implementation Volume. Annex 8 describes the training needs of project personnel, including these&#13;
workers.&#13;
2.30         The possibility of using existing workers and supervisory cadres for the task of GMP under&#13;
the project was seriously considered. Given the current workload of existing grass-root level health and&#13;
family planning workers, it is neither feasible nor desirable to add to their responsibilities further.&#13;
Moreover, they are not available at the village level. The same applies to personnel of other sectors,&#13;
such as teachers and agricultural extension workers. However, at the Thana level, it has been decided&#13;
by MOHFW that the Assistant Thana Family Planning Officer would serve as the Thana Nutrition&#13;
Coordinator, avoiding the creation of a new post. As for CNPs and CNOs, the project would select&#13;
women meeting agreed criteria (annex 9) from existing community development volunteers, for instance,&#13;
the members of the Village Defence Party (VDP)". In case suitable candidates are not available from&#13;
VDP in a given village or union, the selection would be made from the rest of the community and the&#13;
selected person(s) could then join the VDP. Since the activities of CNP involve a range of welfare&#13;
services, a strong cooperation between CNPs and the other sectoral personnel at the field level would be&#13;
ensured through the involvement of the Union Parishad.&#13;
2.31         CNPs and CNOs would need to be suitably compensated for the additional community&#13;
service they perform under the project. But they would not form a new cadre of GOB workers; rather&#13;
they are members of the community who would be contracted to perform specific community service&#13;
work. The project would finance the costs of honoraria for CNPs and CNOs, which have been agreed&#13;
at Tk. 500 and Tk. 1,000 each per month respectively.&#13;
The Village Defence Party (VDP), is a volunteer group in rural Bangladesh with a registered membership of about five&#13;
million people. The group is financed and organized under the Ministry of Home Affairs and given training in life-skills&#13;
and vocational skills - but the majority of the registered volunteers have not yet been trained. It was originally&#13;
created as a community movement to protect villages. It has since become a development volunteer organization&#13;
and people wishing to contribute to community development activities could register with it. The VDPs do not have&#13;
a fixed job description but are called on to give some of their time to community work from time to time as&#13;
necessary. Though the organization has retained its name, "defence party", it is neither militant nor political.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
2.32       The project would need, in each of the village/community where CBNC would operate the&#13;
CNC, 500-1000 square feet of secure accommodation where project materials including food stocks could&#13;
be stored, simple food preparation facilities exist and about 40-50 women and their children could be&#13;
accommodated during feeding and IEC sessions. The first option to arrange this would be to get the local&#13;
communities to contribute such a space for the use of the project. Judging from the experience of&#13;
conducting satellite clinics for family planning/Maternal and child health services, such an option appears&#13;
to be feasible. Failing this, possibilities of using existing public buildings such as schools will be&#13;
explored. If this also proves to be infeasible, a suitable accommodation would be rented, in which case,&#13;
the project would finance the cost of such rental. In addition, incidental expenses in running the CNC,&#13;
such as cleaning supplies, will also be financed from the project up to 300 taka per month per CNC.&#13;
Inter-Sectoral Nutrition Program Development (US$7.0 million)&#13;
2.33       The main purpose of this component would be to respond to nutritional program needs&#13;
through efforts beyond the scope of CBNC, by supporting innovative actions with a potential for positive&#13;
nutrition impact, carried out by sectors other than health/family planning. It would enhance the nutrition&#13;
benefits of those sectors' programs, say, through better targeting and/or coordination. It is not feasible&#13;
to bring all the activities in every sector of import to nutrition under one project; such activities should&#13;
be rightfully carried out by the respective sectors from their regular allocation of resources; this&#13;
component does not seek to replace those resources. Therefore, this component will support the&#13;
nutritional reorientation of various sectoral activities, retargeting them to the nutritionally vulnerable&#13;
population and/or initiation of innovative activities but not the mere expansion of programs that are&#13;
already the normal responsibility of a given ministry.&#13;
2.34       An Inter-Sectoral Nutrition Fund (ISNF) will be established by GOB to finance facilitating&#13;
activities to accomplish the reorientation/retargeting. Government Departments and NGOs will be able&#13;
to draw on this fund to undertake specific activities or obtain seed monies to pilot new initiatives which&#13;
would contribute to the goals of this project. After their pilot phase, such new programs would be&#13;
financed out of the respective sector's own resources. NGOs such as Grameen Bank and BRAC have&#13;
considerable experience in income generation activities (especially targeted to women), which are very&#13;
relevant to enhancing household food security. Therefore, sub-projects including such activities to be&#13;
carried out by NGOs with a proven track-record would also be potential candidates for funding under this&#13;
component. Only proposals meeting agreed criteria (Annex 10) will be financed from the ISNF.&#13;
Agreement was reached during Negotiations with GOB that, promptly after Credit-signing, the&#13;
proposed ISNF will be established and operated in a manner satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
2.35       An Inter-Sectoral Nutrition Cell (ISNC) has been established as part of this project to bring&#13;
about inter-sectoral coordination with regard to nutrition and to monitor and oversee the progress of the&#13;
inter-sectoral component. The cell will be headed by a Joint-Secretary, MOHFW, with representation&#13;
of the relevant sectoral ministries and the NGOs. The sectoral ministries currently being considered for&#13;
inclusion in the cell are: Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Food, Relief and Rehabilitation, Ministry&#13;
of Fisheries and Livestock, Ministry of Women's Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Local&#13;
Government and Rural Development, Ministry of Home Affairs (under whom the VDP organization is&#13;
placed) and Ministry of Social Welfare.  Interested NGOs will be represented jointly by two&#13;
representatives. The cell will be staffed by clerical and other support staff and housed in the Secretariat&#13;
buildings within MOHFW. Agreement was reached during Negotiations with GOB that ISNC will&#13;
be maintained and operated with the authority to clear sub-project proposals to be financed from&#13;
ISNF, based on criteria agreed with IDA and that each sub-project proposal to be financed from&#13;
the fund will be subject to prior review and approval by IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
2.36       Three sub-project proposals currently being developed for financing under this component&#13;
are: (i) integrating homestead vegetable production with CBNC; (ii) examining the consumption and&#13;
nutritional impact of agricultural policies and programs with a view to appropriate modifications; and&#13;
(iii) homestead poultry production as a means of generating earnings and nutrient supplements for the&#13;
poor households. Proposals (i) and (ii) are being developed by the Ministry of Agriculture and the&#13;
proposal (iii) belongs to Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock. These three proposals meet the selection&#13;
criteria but would be subject to further technical review by IDA before being finally selected for funding.&#13;
The Project has been costed with adequate monies to cover activities worth US$7.5 million (including&#13;
contingencies) from ISNF; if any of the above three proposals are not found to be suitable for funding,&#13;
other appropriate activities meeting agreed criteria and selected as per agreed procedures, could be&#13;
financed from ISNF. Examples of other activities which might be included in the future are: reorienting&#13;
and retargeting food programs such as Vulnerable Group Development, Rural Maintenance Program and&#13;
Food for Work schemes under the Ministry of Relief and Rehabilitation; targeted credit programs to food-&#13;
insecure households to improve their earning capacity - particularly that of women in these households&#13;
(through NGOs as well as GOB); inclusion of nutrition elements in school curricula; inclusion of nutrition&#13;
elements in the training curricula of grass-root level workers of the relevant sectors and IEC activities&#13;
to promote the proper use of safe water and of sanitary latrines.&#13;
F. Geographic Scope and Phasing&#13;
2.37       The field activities of the CBNC would be phased in, so that a total of 40 thanas (out of&#13;
Bangladesh's 460 thanas), i.e., about 8-9% of the population would have been covered by the end of the&#13;
project period; activities such as program development, institution building and IEC development would&#13;
be at the national level; IEC message delivery will be through CBNC by inter-personal methods and&#13;
nationwide through mass media; most inter-sectoral activities are intended to closely follow CBNC&#13;
phasing, with some possible exceptions depending on resource requirements and absorptive capacity at&#13;
the national level (e.g., studies of consumption and nutrition effects of agricultural or food policy); and&#13;
the support to existing micronutrient activities would be extended throughout the country. After the&#13;
BRAC pilot initiative, CBNC under this project is the first large scale venture of this sort to be&#13;
undertaken in the country. Therefore a carefully graded approach is being proposed for the phasing in&#13;
of CBNC. During the first year, CBNC would be limited to six thanas and no new thanas will be added&#13;
in the second year to allow adequate time for start-up activities and to refine operational details of&#13;
community mobilization, communications and service delivery, in these initial thanas. Learning from&#13;
the experience in these thanas, and taking account of findings from the review after the first two years,&#13;
17 more thanas would be added in the third year and 17 more in the fourth year. The results of a mid-&#13;
term evaluation at the end of three years would determine the pace of further expansion as also the&#13;
subsequent design of the project. The project itself is intended as the first phase of a national community&#13;
nutrition program, which would be expanded to the rest of the country following favorable evaluation at&#13;
the end of six years, and subject to implementation capacity.&#13;
2.38       The geographic location of the project's field activities would be determined through&#13;
application of the following decision rules, which are amplified in annex 2: (a) at least one district would&#13;
be included per division, to allow testing in different environments; (b) about half the thanas would be&#13;
covered in each project district, to make it cost-effective to develop project support systems, and to allow&#13;
an element of local competition for entry into the project; (c) a range of distressed and non-distressed&#13;
districts and thanas would be chosen; (d) but districts and thanas which are the most disaster-prone or lack&#13;
basic health infrastructure, would be avoided so as to give the proposed project reasonable chance of&#13;
success; (e) only thanas with at least 80% of infants fully immunized would be selected. The six thanas&#13;
for the first year have already been selected, one from each Division. Agreement was reached during&#13;
Negotiations with GOB that by June 30, 1996 and by December 31, 1996, the thanas for introducing&#13;
CBNC in the third and fourth years will be selected as per criteria agreed with IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
G. Gender Perspective&#13;
2.39       Women, particularly during pregnancy and lactation, form a principal group of beneficiaries&#13;
of this project. Therefore, they stand to profit directly from the project's nutritional impact. Moreover,&#13;
the community-based project activities are directed at social mobilization and community empowerment,&#13;
which would have to occur primarily through the advancement of women's status in the society. All the&#13;
grass-root project personnel in CBNC would be women, thus creating income-generating opportunities.&#13;
More income-generating opportunities will be created by this project, as the supplementary food in CBNC&#13;
is proposed to be prepared, packaged and provided by women's groups at the village level and/or small-&#13;
scale industries at the union level. Rural credit schemes (from GOB's own fuinds) have also been&#13;
included as a possible inter-sectoral activity - again leading to potential enhancements in women's income&#13;
and status. Improved nutrition status among children would result in increased child survival, in turn&#13;
reducing fertility and thereby benefiting women's health. The project activities would take account of&#13;
the male members of the households as well; one important reason is the Bangladeshi cultural context in&#13;
which men control key decisions about the types and amounts of foods purchased. Project monitoring&#13;
indicators will be gender-disaggregated and gender equity will be a strong consideration in the recruitment&#13;
of higher level project staff.&#13;
H. Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.40       No detrimental environmental impacts are expected to occur due to the proposed project&#13;
activities. The inter-sectoral component of the project is likely to benefit the environment by promoting&#13;
the use of improved sanitary latrines and safe water supply. The indirect project benefit of reduced&#13;
population growth (as a result of increased child survival) would lead to a decreased burden on the&#13;
environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
III. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, DISBURSEMENT AND PROCUREMENT&#13;
A. Project Costs&#13;
3.1            Cost Sumnaries.  The total cost of the project, including duties and taxes, is estimated at&#13;
about Taka 2,690 million or US$67.3 million equivalent. Duties and taxes would amount to around&#13;
US$805,200 (1.2% of the total costs). A breakdown of costs of the proposed project by component and&#13;
by categories of expenditure appears in tables 3.1 and 3.2 respectively. Detailed project cost tables by&#13;
component, categories of expenditure and years of implementation are in Annex 11.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.2        Basis of Cost Estimates. Cost estimates have been made based on information provided by&#13;
GOB and calculations made by UNICEF and IDA experts. Costs of therapeutic nutrition supplementation&#13;
and other consumables are based on estimates obtained locally. Costs of compensation for CNPs are&#13;
calculated at 500 taka per month and incidental expenses for running the CNCs at taka 300 per month;&#13;
compensation for CNOs is costed at Tk. 1,000 per month; these were found by local enquiries to be the&#13;
reasonable amounts for the required purpose. These estimates concurred with the information provided&#13;
by an NGO who has already implemented similar activities in the communities. Salaries and allowances&#13;
of GOB personnel in the Project are estimated on the basis of GOB pay scales.&#13;
3.3        Taxes and Duties. All imported goods are subject to custom duties and taxes. Duties and&#13;
taxes applied to this project amount to 1.2% of the project costs and will be financed by GOB.&#13;
3.4        Contingency Allowances. Physical contingencies have been calculated at 10%on vehicles&#13;
and 5.0% on other goods. Price contingencies have been applied using the Bank guidelines at 4.0% for&#13;
1995, 4.0% for 1996, 4.0% for 1997, 4.5% for 1998, 4.5% for 1999 and 5.0% for 2000 for local price&#13;
increases and at 2.2 % for each of the project years for international price increases. A purchasing power&#13;
parity assumption for the exchange rate was applied to offset the difference between local and foreign&#13;
inflation in the project years.&#13;
3.5        Foreign Exchange Component. The estimated foreign exchange component of the project&#13;
costs is the equivalent of US$ 2.9 million or 4.4% of total project costs and is calculated as follows:&#13;
Equipment and furniture: 4%; vehicles: 55%; and expatriate technical assistance: 100%.&#13;
3.6        Recurrent Cost Implications. The total recurrent costs of the project when fully operational&#13;
in 40 thanas as per the proposed phasing is about US$13.5 million spread over 6 years. The main&#13;
incremental recurrent expenditures in the project are for the honoraria to CNPs and CNOs and the costs&#13;
of running the CNCs (operating expenses). The CNPs and CNOs will not be GOB employees and will&#13;
be compensated only on a temporary basis through NGOs. The thana-level staff are being drawn from&#13;
existing staff under MOHFW and therefore do not entail additional costs. Additional staff positions being&#13;
created because of the project are minimal (mainly at the Project Office and ISNC) and the total salary&#13;
costs of such staff are budgeted at only US$653,700 for the entire project period. If the CBNC activities&#13;
were to be continued beyond the project period, the recurrent costs of such activities are estimated to be&#13;
about $70,000 per thana per year; however, CBNC activities should not be required in a given thana on&#13;
an indefinite basis; they are intended to be phased out gradually after 10-15 years. The Government will&#13;
bear the cost of salaries and allowances, maintenance of vehicles and equipment and custom duties and&#13;
taxes; the Government will also take on the incremental recurrent expenditures which will be financed&#13;
by IDA on a declining basis (para 3.14).&#13;
B. Financing&#13;
3.7        Of the total estimated project costs of US$67.3 million, the IDA credit of US$59.8 million&#13;
amounts to 88.9% and the GOB contribution of US$7.5 million amounts to 11.1%. All expenditures&#13;
involving foreign exchange would be met from the IDA credit. Cost recovery by way of user charges&#13;
is not considered feasible in the context of Bangladesh in view of the extreme poverty of the intended&#13;
beneficiaries. Table 3.3 shows the financing plan.&#13;

d/ These project elements represent non-procurement expenditures.&#13;
3.9          All project procurement will be made in accordance with the respective IDA guidelines.&#13;
Project-financed consultants would be recruited according to the Bank's guidelines for Use of Consultants&#13;
by World Bank Borrowers and World Bank as Executing Agency. Standard bidding documents will be&#13;
used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
3.10        IEC materials (total value, $2.16 million) will be procured through International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB). Vehicles, equipment, furniture and supplies (total value, $5.03 million) will be procured&#13;
by Local Competitive Bidding (LCB); however, bicycles and other small items of equipment, which may&#13;
be needed on an urgent basis may be procured through UNICEF. The equipment and supplies to be&#13;
procured under the project are to be spread over the project period (according to the phasing of the&#13;
project activities), making each bid too small to attract international bidders; moreover, the items to be&#13;
procured are all locally available, e.g., utensils for the community nutrition center, shoulder bags,&#13;
measuring tapes, stationery items and growth charts. Training materials (total value $1.56 million) will&#13;
be developed by the NGOs who will be involved in project implementation using their own staff; at the&#13;
present time competitive bidding is not feasible for this purpose since there is only one NGO, i.e.,&#13;
BRAC, which has the experience and expertise to undertake this task effectively in line with the project&#13;
design. Therapeutic nutrients i.e., iron tablets and vitamin A capsules, (total value, $1.18 million) will&#13;
be procured from UNICEF.&#13;
3.11        Therapeutic food supplements (total value, $23.76 million) will be produced by women's&#13;
groups, cooperatives, cottage industries or other community-based systems within the villages using&#13;
locally available raw materials (wheat, jaggery, pulses and oil). The raw materials (total value, $14.8&#13;
million) included in the $23.76M cost of food supplement will be procured by the respective community&#13;
based systems from the local markets by prudent shopping. The rationale for such a local community-&#13;
based procurement is as follows: (a) the supplementary feeding operation is to be carried out in nearly&#13;
8,000 villages by as many CNPs; central procurement of food ingredients, preparation, packaging,&#13;
storage and distribution would call for a highly efficient system of managing the logistics of these steps;&#13;
the current systems in Bangladesh are not capable of handling these additional requirements effectively&#13;
without an interruption in the supply of food supplements; (b) local procurement at the village level would&#13;
encourage community involvement and ownership; it would also provide income-generating opportunities&#13;
for women, thus complementing the project objectives; (c) all the raw materials are generally available&#13;
in the rural communities of Bangladesh; (d) spreading the procurement over the many villages might also&#13;
increase the transparency of the process and reduce the scope for mismanagement of funds, since the&#13;
CNPs are close to the beneficiaries and the amounts involved are divided into smaller portions; (e) it is&#13;
desirable to keep the process of preparation closer to the point of operation to minimize loss of shelf-life&#13;
due to transportation and other delays involved in distributing the food. Based on the estimated cost of&#13;
food supplements to be procured per village, a limit of $1000 per year per CNP would be appropriate&#13;
for this item of procurement.&#13;
3.12        The amount of procurement to be managed at the central level is relatively small, since the&#13;
main item of procurement, i.e., therapeutic food supplements would be provided in a decentralized&#13;
manner. As for centrally procured items, the procurement unit under the Directorate-General of Family&#13;
Planning will be responsible for the procurement goods and the Project Office will be responsible for the&#13;
procurement of Technical Assistance (total value, $14.33 million).  UNICEF would assist in the&#13;
recruitment of individual consultants for technical assistance as may be deemed necessary by GOB. The&#13;
procurement plans for such centrally handled items are included in the overall implementation plan.&#13;
3.13        All ICB procurements, LCB packages for the procurement of goods estimated to cost in&#13;
excess of $200,000 and requirements for consultant services in excess of $100,000 with firms and those&#13;
in excess of US$50,000 with individuals will be subject to prior review by IDA. This would cover&#13;
approximately 24% of the total value of procurement under the project.&#13;

3.15        Special Account. A Convertible Taka Special Account will be opened with a commercial Bank on&#13;
terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, including appropriate protection against set-off, seizure or attachment.&#13;
The authorized allocation for the Special Account has been agreed at Tk. 80 million; however, such authorized&#13;
allocation shall be limited to Tk. 24 million until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Credit plus the total&#13;
amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by IDA shall equal or exceed SDR 2.7 million. The&#13;
authorized allocation would be withdrawn from the Credit and deposited into the Special Account to facilitate smooth&#13;
implementation by allowing more immediate access to the Credit when required. Withdrawals from the Special&#13;
Account shall be against the eligible categories listed in table 3.5; such withdrawals from and subsequent&#13;
replenishments of the Special Account will be made as per standard procedures, detailed in the Development Credit&#13;
Agreement. Accounting and auditing requirements that apply to project expenditures shall apply equally to those&#13;
expenditures reimbursed through the Special Account.&#13;
3.16        Required Documentation.  Disbursements up to a limit of US$200,000 in respect of project&#13;
expenditures on procurement of goods, up to US$100,000 in respect of consultant services provided by firms and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

up to US$50,000 in respect of consultant services provided by individuals will be made against withdrawal&#13;
applications supported by Statement of Expenditure certified by the Project Director and by MOHFW, such limits&#13;
being applied to each individual disbursement. The Project Office will retain all relevant documentation in respect&#13;
of such statements of expenditure and make them available to IDA for review on request. Expenditures greater than&#13;
the above limits will be reimbursed against fully documented withdrawal applications.&#13;
3.17         Although ISNF is to be established by GOB as an open fund, it will not be a mechanism to advance&#13;
monies from the IDA Credit. The disbursement criteria and documentation requirements for the activities financed&#13;
from ISNF will be the same as for similar activities being carried out under the rest of the project. The ISNF will&#13;
be a GOB fund to attract good sub-project proposals from various agencies and to facilitate inter-sectoral action.&#13;
3.18         The disbursement projections in table 3.6 take account of the planned phasing of CBNC and the&#13;
retroactive financing of preparatory costs up to US$ 500,000, - incurred after March 1, 1995 - under the categories&#13;
of goods and consultants' services. In order to ensure adequate project readiness, i.e., for activities to begin in full&#13;
swing once the Credit is declared effective, the Project Office has already been created, key staff have been&#13;
recruited and office accommodation and other facilities arranged. Furthermore, baseline surveys, preparation of&#13;
training materials and audience research for IEC message development are to be carried out prior to Credit-signing.&#13;
The purpose of retroactive financing is to cover the costs of these startup activities.&#13;

IV. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
4.1        Preparation process and status. Project preparation has been carried out through close&#13;
collaboration between GOB, IDA and UNICEF and in consultation with other development partners,&#13;
including Asian Development Bank, Germany (KfW and GTZ), USAID, United Nations Development&#13;
Program, WHO and NGOs. Specific NGOs who have been involved are: BRAC, which is currently&#13;
implementing a project in one thana on very similar lines as CBNC; Hlellen Keller International, which&#13;
has put into place a nutrition surveillance system and is interested in expanding such a system into the&#13;
project thanas; Grameen Bank; CARE; Save the Children Fund (US and UK) - who have all had previous&#13;
nutrition experience in the country. Comments and suggestions were provided by the bilateral donors&#13;
financing Fourth Population and Health Project as well. The project concepts, design, activities, and&#13;
implementation plans were agreed between GOB and IDA, UNICEF Missions and further details were&#13;
worked out by several working groups under MOHFW, Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Fisheries&#13;
and Livestock, coordinated by a Project Preparation Steering Committee in MOHFW. The Government&#13;
then approved a project concept paper after it was reviewed by IDA. In line with agreements reached&#13;
at the negotiations and with the project description contained in this SAR, GOB has prepared a Project&#13;
Proforma (PP). Technical support to GOB for further preparation continues to come from UNICEF, the&#13;
Bank, and BRAC. A detailed Project Implementation Volume, including an implementation plan and&#13;
monitoring plan, has been drafted. The draft Project Implementation Volume was discussed during the&#13;
Negotiations and will be finalized at the Project Launch Workshop. A Memorandum of Understanding&#13;
for technical cooperation between GOB and the Institute of Nutrition, Mahidol University, Thailand has&#13;
been prepared. The Institute is internationally recognized in the field of nutrition and its technical&#13;
assistance should contribute to local capacity building.&#13;
4.2        The role played by UNICEF. UNICEF's technical support went far beyond participation&#13;
in joint missions with IDA; more than 20 studies were carried out by UNICEF specifically to meet the&#13;
technical requirements of this project. UNICEF's resources were readily made available for such studies,&#13;
consultancies and study tours both to provide high quality scientific inputs into the project preparation&#13;
and to develop awareness and commitment among policy-makers and managers of GOB. UNICEF is also&#13;
assisting already with the preparation of training curricula and materials and the Project Implementation&#13;
Volume. The formative research for IEC message and material development is currently under way and&#13;
results are expected shortly. UNICEF's Board of Directors recently approved a proposal to raise&#13;
supplementary funds up to a limit of $15 million to provide additional technical support to this project&#13;
during its implementation. This UNICEF supplementary mechanism would be one possible mode of&#13;
channeling possible future funding that might be made available by bilateral donors; thus, while the&#13;
project does not currently include cofinancing, it is expected that donors other than IDA would become&#13;
substantively involved (through UNICEF or directly) in the future. Such additional involvement would&#13;
become particularly appropriate if this project proves successful and resources are required for its&#13;
expansion to other parts of the country.&#13;
4.3        Implementation Responsibility. The CBNC and IEC components and related monitoring and&#13;
evaluation would be the responsibility of MOHFW, which will be discharged through the establishment&#13;
of a Project Office accountable to a National Steering Committee through a National Nutrition&#13;
Management Committee, both under MOHFW. The project will provide for a Management and&#13;
Technical Support Team consisting of four or five consultants to assist the Project Office. Team members&#13;
would include people with expertise in training, monitoring and evaluation, community nutrition, and&#13;
project management. The Government and IDA have agreed outline terms of reference for the technical&#13;
assistance; detailed terms of reference are now being prepared, to be included in the revised Project&#13;
Implementation Volume. Agreements were reached with GOB during negotiations that in accordance&#13;
with TOR acceptable to IDA, the Project Office will be maintained and operated with adequate&#13;
staff, funding and other facilities and by September 30, 1995, Management and Technical Support&#13;
Team would be established and maintained with the necessary expertise, to assist the Project Office.&#13;
The Inter-Sectoral Nutrition Program Development component would be coordinated by the proposed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
ISNC. The sub-projects under the inter-sectoral component would be implemented by the line ministries&#13;
or departments or NGOs, which put forth the respective proposals. The Ministry of Home Affairs will&#13;
be co-opted in the project implementation inasmuch as the project volunteers are to be selected from the&#13;
VDP. At the district, thana, union and village levels, Nutrition Management Committees will be set up&#13;
with representatives from the various ministries and departments involved. Annex 13 presents an&#13;
organizational chart for the project.&#13;
4.4        NGO Involvement. This project has been designed to include a major role for NGOs in its&#13;
implementation. In view of BRAC's expertise in community-based nutrition activities, BRAC has been&#13;
more closely involved in this project's preparation and is expected to continue its participation in&#13;
implementation as well. However, NGO participation has not been limited to BRAC; others such as&#13;
Hellen Keller International, CARE, Grameen Bank, and Save the Children Fund (US &amp; UK) are also&#13;
interested and would be involved. Two modalities of NGO support to project implementation will be&#13;
adopted: (a) some thanas will be wholly contracted out to NGOs for the management and implementation&#13;
of all CBNC activities; in each of these thanas, a selected NGO will take the full responsibility for all&#13;
activities, including the recruitment and training of the various field personnel, community mobilization,&#13;
procurement, preparation, packaging and delivery of food supplements, payment of salaries/honoraria and&#13;
allowances, procurement of equipment and supplies, quality control, supervision and monitoring and IEC&#13;
activities; they would use the existing GOB systems for the provision of Primary Health Care services&#13;
as necessary and for inter-sectoral coordination; they will provide monitoring reports to GOB on an&#13;
agreed format and periodicity; (b) in the other thanas, GOB will use its own management structure to run&#13;
the project activities, assign Assistant Thana Family Planning Officer as Thana Nutrition Coordinator,&#13;
recruit the community nutrition promoters and organizers from the VDP (see paragraph 2.30 above) as&#13;
far as possible, procure equipment and supplies and be responsible for monitoring and administrative&#13;
supervision of field personnel; NGO support will be provided in the following key areas: community&#13;
mobilization, training and technical supervision of field personnel, logistics of preparing, packaging and&#13;
supplying food supplements, including quality control. The terms of reference for NGO involvement in&#13;
project implementation were discussed during the Negotiations, and will be finalized at the Project Launch&#13;
Workshop, taking account of IDA's comments. Agreement was reached during Negotiations that GOB&#13;
will enter into an agreement with one or more organizations acceptable to IDA, and in accordance&#13;
with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, which will govern such organizations' participation in&#13;
the field-level activities under the project.&#13;
4.5        Implementation Schedule. CBNC is to be phased in to cover six thanas in the first year.&#13;
Then, after a review at the end of two years, 17 more thanas are to be included in each of the third and&#13;
fourth years. The broad implementation schedule of project activities is shown in annex 14; more&#13;
detailed action plans for each component will be included in the Project Implementation Volume.&#13;
Agreement was reached during Negotiations that by September 30, 1995, GOB will prepare and&#13;
furnish to IDA, for its concurrence, a detailed implementation and monitoring plan and thereafter&#13;
carry it out in a timely manner.&#13;
4.6        Monitoring and Evaluation. There is a separate component to ensure strong monitoring and&#13;
evaluation (para 2.21 - 2.24). This not only reflects the importance attached to these essential functions&#13;
in this project but also allows the clear and separate allocation of funds to them. Such a design also&#13;
brings together these aspects in the overall project context, since the implementing responsibility for the&#13;
components is divided between different agencies. The monitoring proposed under the project would be&#13;
the responsibility of each participating ministry and the Project Office. ISNC would be responsible for&#13;
pulling together the inter-sectoral monitoring reports. A specific provision is being made for a special&#13;
review of the first 6 CBNC thanas after two years, a mid-term evaluation at the end of three years to take&#13;
stock of project progress, glean lessons from implementation experience and determine the scope and&#13;
nature of further expansion of the project, applying mid-course corrections as may be necessary. At the&#13;
end of the project period another evaluation will be carried out. As measurable nutritional impact is&#13;
likely to take 5 to 10 years of intensive efforts, and as the project is being phased in, continuous&#13;
monitoring of process indicators is of immediate importance. But outcome indicators are also being&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
included in the baseline for purposes of eventual impact evaluation. IDA-UNICEF supervision missions&#13;
would be carried out twice a year. Annex 15 provides a tentative schedule of supervision missions,&#13;
which would review the reports derived from GOB's regular monitoring, besides holding discussions with&#13;
the Project Office and other concerned GOB officials, NGOs and development partners. Agreements&#13;
were reached during Negotiations with GOB that a review system would be established and carried&#13;
out and that progress reports will be furnished to IDA at the semi-annual supervision nissions.&#13;
4.7        Funding Mechanism, Flow of Funds and Accountability. The Project Finance Cell (PFC)&#13;
which administers the donor funds under the Fourth Population and Health Project, will administer the&#13;
Special Account of the project in accordance with GOB procedures as agreed with IDA. The PFC will&#13;
function as the Treasury in accordance with the financial rules of GOB for this project. The Special&#13;
Account will be established in a scheduled bank (preferably Sonali Bank). As per the allocation in the&#13;
Annual Development Program of the project, authorization for release of funds will be obtained from the&#13;
Ministry of Finance at the beginning of the fiscal year and PFC will then release funds in favor of the&#13;
Project Director on a quarterly basis, in advance. The Project Director will then place the funds at the&#13;
disposal of Assistant Thana Family Planning Officer who will be the Drawing and Disbursing Officer at&#13;
the Thana level. This Officer will disburse the funds to cover salaries and operating expenses to CNP&#13;
and CNO every month. The Project Director will also release funds on a quarterly basis to the&#13;
implementing NGO as per the Memorandum of Understanding between GOB and the NGO. The NGO&#13;
and the Assistant Thana Family Planning Officer will be responsible for record-keeping, furnishing&#13;
expenditure statement, and vouchers as necessary, to the Project Director. The Project Director will&#13;
coordinate all financial transactions relating to the project, furnish necessary reports and returns to the&#13;
PFC and IDA for settlement of advances made and for claiming replenishment. Detailed procedures will&#13;
be developed by PFC for guiding the accounting staff at various levels and steps will be taken to ensure&#13;
that the expenditure accounting for the advances are submitted promptly. A copy of these detailed&#13;
instructions for various levels of accounting staff for this project will be included as part of the Project&#13;
Implementation Volume. No additional advances will be provided until expenditures for previous&#13;
advances have been accounted for. At the thana level, a bank account will be opened by Assistant Thana&#13;
Family Planning Officer to receive the funds from PFC. He/she will ensure timely disbursement of fund&#13;
to CNP/CNO and the NGOs. Similarly, the NGOs will have accounts to manage the project funds&#13;
effectively. ISNF will be established as a separate GOB Fund and managed by PFC. Implementing&#13;
agencies will draw funds from ISNF as per sub-project proposals cleared by ISNC and by IDA; then they&#13;
will place these funds at the disposal of appropriate field-level officials and obtain accounts of&#13;
expenditure. The ISNF will then be replenished by reimbursements from the IDA Credit against&#13;
appropriate disbursement categories for eligible expenditures. The PFC is adequately staffed and has&#13;
experience in dealing with accounts, and with procedures required by IDA. The Project Director has an&#13;
account set-up which will maintain and keep records of fund flows and expenditure. He/she, along with&#13;
PFC, will be responsible for monitoring, control and supervision of accounting administration over other&#13;
project implementing agencies.&#13;
4.8        Accounts and Audits.  The following agreements were reached with GOB during&#13;
Negotiations: that GOB will maintain records and accounts in accordance with sound accounting&#13;
practices, to reflect the operations, resources and all expenditures in respect of the project; that such&#13;
records and accounts, including those for the Special Account, will be audited in accordance with&#13;
appropriate auditing principles, consistently applied, by independent auditors acceptable to IDA;&#13;
that a certified copy of the reports of such audit will be furnished to IDA not later than nine months&#13;
after the end of the respective fiscal years; that such other information concerning the said records,&#13;
accounts and the audit as may be reasonably requested by IDA will be furnished by GOB; that, in&#13;
addition to the foregoing, GOB will, in respect of withdrawals made on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditure, retain until at least one year after IDA's receipt of the audit report for the fiscal year&#13;
in which the last withdrawal is made, all records evidencing such expenditures; that such records&#13;
will be made available to IDA's representatives on request; that such records will be included in the&#13;
aforementioned annual audit reports; and that the report of such audit will contain a separate&#13;
opinion by the said auditors as to whether the statements of expenditure submitted, together with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support&#13;
the related withdrawals.       V. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
5.1        The project would contribute to the following direct benefits: (a) an enhancement in GOB&#13;
capacity to formulate a sound national nutrition program and to implement it effectively; (b) an&#13;
improvement in the nutritional status of children under 2 years of age and of women and a consequent&#13;
increase in child survival rates; (c) higher status for women as a result of the project focus on women&#13;
and the social mobilization efforts under the project; and (d) increased productivity, and improved&#13;
learning capacity, as a result of improved nutritional status. Indirect project benefits include (a) a greater&#13;
acceptance of contraception as a result of improved child survival; (b) better general health status,&#13;
particularly among mothers and children; (c) consequent cost savings for the health care system and&#13;
therefore to the economy as a whole; (d) improved community organization in rural Bangladesh, which&#13;
could prove to be an advantage to other programs which do not have a grass-root level infrastructure but&#13;
need one for their activities. In view of some of its new strategies, the project is likely to yield useful&#13;
lessons on community-based nutrition efforts, not only for Bangladesh, but for other similar programs&#13;
elsewhere, especially in the South Asia region. If inter-sectoral coordination turns out to be successful,&#13;
the mechanism proposed under the project could become a model for such cooperation across the sectors.&#13;
5.2        Cost per beneficiary.  The nutritional impact would, in the first instance, be on the&#13;
population groups targeted by CBNC. In the long run, however, they would accrue to the other segments&#13;
of the population as well, because of basic changes in household behaviors related to health and nutrition;&#13;
also the benefits of preventing growth lag among children under two years would result in increasing&#13;
proportions of better nourished population as these children grow older. It is difficult to estimate the&#13;
number of beneficiaries precisely, since the impact of nutritional counseling would be felt on different&#13;
people to different degrees. Even estimating the number of immediate beneficiaries of GMP is not easy,&#13;
because depending on the nutritional status of the individuals in a given community, they would receive&#13;
varying levels of service. Counting only those women and children who might receive supplementary&#13;
feeding as project beneficiaries would result in a fallacious under-count because supplementary feeding&#13;
is not the main benefit - the project does not seek to set up a feeding program - supplementary feeding&#13;
is being used primarily as an educational tool. All the women of reproductive age group will be&#13;
contacted and would receive nutritional counseling, but pregnant and lactating women and children under&#13;
two years would receive further screening with additional counseling and those who meet nutritional&#13;
criteria would get supplementary feeding as well. In fact, a smaller number of people requiring&#13;
supplementary feeding in a given community might indicate a greater success of the project - those who&#13;
do not need it have perhaps benefited more than those who do. Moreover, calculating costs per&#13;
beneficiary does not reflect the duration for which such benefit is received; a pregnant and lactating&#13;
woman would receive supplementary feeding for anywhere from 6 to 12 months, depending on at what&#13;
point in pregnancy she gets registered; under-two children would get only 4 months of supplementation&#13;
unless they relapse into the program again. Despite these limitations annex 16 makes an attempt to&#13;
calculate the number of beneficiaries who would be screened and those who would receive supplementary&#13;
feeding. Assuming 80% coverage and taking account of the phasing scheme for the 40 CBNC thanas,&#13;
a total of 3,144,320 women and children are estimated to be screened for malnutrition over the 6-year&#13;
project period and 1,946,400 of them are estimated to receive supplementary feeding. Since the total cost&#13;
of CBNC is estimated at US$ 32.6 million, the unit cost per beneficiary screened and counseled would&#13;
amount to US$10.37. This compares with the US$9.08 per child in the BRAC's pilot initiative and with&#13;
US$9.41 for 1984-85 in the Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Project. These calculations should be taken&#13;
merely as indicative of rough unit costs. They would work out much lower if the denominator were to&#13;
include all the women of reproductive age and all children; in fact, the spill-over benefits of behavioral&#13;
change would accrue to other family members too.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
5.3        Assessing the number of beneficiaries of other components is even more difficult, since their&#13;
benefits would be spread over the whole country. Suffice it to say that the costs of initiating a national&#13;
nutrition program as envisaged under this project are a small fraction of expenditures incurred by&#13;
Bangladesh already on ensuring food security or providing health care services. A recent estimation by&#13;
UNICEF based on productivity gains and on savings due to reductions in morbidity and mortality puts&#13;
the benefits of a successful nutrition program at $6.92 for every dollar spent on it.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
5.4        Weak GOB capacity may impede the implementation of project activities. The project seeks&#13;
to reduce this risk in several ways. It would phase the introduction of CBNC while working to enhance&#13;
implementation capacity. It would support a strong project office assisted by Management and Technical&#13;
Support Team. It also provides for very substantial NGO participation and considerable technical support&#13;
is also expected to be given by UNICEF. It includes a specific component on Program Development and&#13;
Institution Building and makes expansion of its activities contingent on the outcome of a mid-term review.&#13;
5.5        Inter-sectoral action and its coordination may be difficult to accomplish due to possible lack&#13;
of interest, awareness and/or initiative among the relevant line ministries because they have traditionally&#13;
seen nutrition as the responsibility of MOHFW and because they have not commonly made the link&#13;
between their sectoral activities and nutrition. The establishment of a separate ISNF would provide&#13;
additional resources to generate such interest, and the ISNC should help mitigate the risk of poor&#13;
intersectoral coordination.&#13;
5.6        The risk that the VDPs and VDP leaders may be ineffective in their tasks as CNPs and&#13;
CNOs respectively would be minimized by careful formulation and pre-testing of job descriptions and&#13;
work routines, gradual phasing of implementation, strong training and supervision support at the field&#13;
level and effective monitoring and review mechanisms. The NGOs would bring additional resources to&#13;
training and supervision.&#13;
C. Sustainabiity&#13;
5.7        The issue of sustainability has mnanagerial, technical and.financial dimensions. It has to be&#13;
addressed through political commitment, institutional capacity, and community empowerment as well as&#13;
financial considerations. The resources required should be viewed based on national investment&#13;
priorities. To ensure fnancial sustainability, adequate commitment on the part of GOB to continue&#13;
project activities beyond the project period and a long-term interest on the part of the development&#13;
partners are essential. The current level of GOB commitment to addressing malnutrition is high. For&#13;
such commitment to continue, investments in nutrition have to be seen from a strategic perspective both&#13;
by the Government and by the international development assistance agencies; expenditure on nutrition&#13;
should be correctly viewed as investment in human capital, an essential pre-requisite for overall&#13;
development. A key determinant of future financial commitment by GOB and its development partners&#13;
will be the successful implementation of this project, as it is the first of its kind in Bangladesh.&#13;
5.8        Recurrent cost implications are discussed in para 3.6. However, these expenditures would&#13;
not be incurred indefinitely, as CBNC in its present form would be a time-bound intervention, say for&#13;
10-15 years in an area; once the prevalence of malnutrition is brought down to manageable levels,&#13;
minimal program inputs integrated into primary health care services should suffice. However in the event&#13;
that CBNC proves to be beneficial in the first 40 thanas, there would obviously be additional costs in&#13;
expanding project activities to other thanas and in continuing the activities in the 40 thanas beyond the&#13;
first project period of 6 years. The recurrent costs of such continuation are estimated at about $70,000&#13;
per thana per year and the investment costs, at about $150,000 per year. Considering that the recently&#13;
abandoned Palli Rationing Scheme incurred $60 million annually in food costs alone, the recurrent cost&#13;
implications of CBNC are not unaffordable by Bangladesh. At $220,000 per thana per year, $60 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
would finance CBNC in nearly 300 thanas simultaneously. These costs could also be staggered over a&#13;
longer period of time, by opting for a phased expansion of CBNC activities. Political will and&#13;
implementation capacity would be more significant factors than the costs, in deciding whether nationwide&#13;
expansion is immediate or phased. It is expected that all costs of expansion would be borne by follow-on&#13;
projects under the development budget, and not absorbed into GOB's revenue budget, as eventually, the&#13;
project activities are to be completely phased out.&#13;
5.9         With regard to the managerial dimension of sustainability, a separate Project Office with&#13;
a sufficiently high-level leadership, a Management and Technical Support Team to assist the Project&#13;
Office and an inter-sectoral cell in MOHFW are included to provide a strong institutional base for the&#13;
project. The extent to which NGO participation in the project implementation is being proposed is a&#13;
welcome innovation and would really go a long way in bolstering management capacity. The extent to&#13;
which UNICEF plans to provide technical support is another factor contributing to managerial capacity.&#13;
5.10        In the long term however, sustainabilitv of the benefits from nutrition interventions is more&#13;
important than sustaining the project activities. This project is being proposed on the basis that the&#13;
interventions are time-bound.  Sustainability of benefits will depend more on the communities'&#13;
understanding of their nutrition problems, their ability to articulate their demands for program assistance,&#13;
and their involvement in appropriate action for improvement. A major aim of CBNC is to create this&#13;
capacity for community assessment, analysis and action. The proposals to use community interest and&#13;
commitment as criteria for entry to the project and to build the central project strategies on IEC at the&#13;
household levels would contribute significantly to this aim. The conceptual basis is to help people help&#13;
themselves - by targeting their behaviors - rather than to give hand-outs, creating dependence. The&#13;
activities to be performed by CNPs in rural Bangladesh would provide a unique opportunity for the&#13;
women to interact on other social issues at the village level. This could bring about a synergy between&#13;
the various activities impinging on the well-being of families, using nutrition as a thematic center of&#13;
community welfare in its broad sense. This is feasible because nutrition is closely related to health,&#13;
family planning, education, women's development, agriculture, rural development and other areas that&#13;
affect the day-to-day life of the village folk. Moreover, since CNPs are drawn from the community, they&#13;
are more likely to continue to be an active locus of social mobilization beyond the project period. This,&#13;
combined with the project's inter-sectoral approach provide for inherent technical sustainability of its&#13;
strategies.&#13;
&#13;

6.2        There are no special conditions of Credit effectiveness.&#13;
6.3        With the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project would constitute a suitable basis&#13;
for an IDA credit of SDR 40.1 million (US$59.8 million equivalent) to Bangladesh on standard IDA terms&#13;
with 40 years maturity.&#13;

BANGLADESH INTEGRATED NUTRITION PROJECT&#13;
Lessons incorporated from earlier projects on Nutrition&#13;
This document describes specific lessons drawn from BRAC's Community Based Pilot Nutrition Initiative&#13;
and previous Bank-financed nutrition projects in other countries as gleaned from the Project&#13;
Completion Reports (PCRs) and OED evaluation studies. It also describes how these lessons have been&#13;
incorporated in the design of the Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition Project (BINP).&#13;

BANGLADESH: Community          1. Involvement of the community in the production and    1. BINP proposes to use a community-based production and&#13;
Based Pilot Nutrition Initiative.    distribution of food leads to a better response to the project   distribution system for the food supplements with the help of&#13;
BRAC project in Muktagacha     initiatives, because the community owns them more.       women's groups.&#13;
(1992-94).&#13;
2. The need for strong supervision was clear.           2. BINP provides for one immediate supervisor per 10 CNPs and for&#13;
strong support from NGOs in project supervision.&#13;
3. The mothers came to the community nutrition center   3. BINP indeed seeks to enhance inter-sectoral synergies among          co&#13;
often because it offered them an opportunity to socialize  related social areas through CBNC, where the women would have a&#13;
other women.                                            forum to discuss broader issues of interest.&#13;
4. Women who came to the nutrition center found that    4. Community mobilization and development of such learning&#13;
they learnt not only from the community worker but equally   opportunities are at the center of BINP's design.&#13;
importantly from each other as well.&#13;
INDIA: First Tamil Nadu        1. The First Tamilnadu Integrated Nutrition Project (TINP-1)    1. Growth monitoring and targeted supplementary feeding with the&#13;
Integrated Nutrition Project   showed that part-time village workers, if properly trained  use of carefully selected and trained village-level workers is at the&#13;

INDIA: First Tamil Nadu         2. Key to the success of TINP was great care in planning   2. The same type of attention to detail is being paid in the&#13;
Integrated Nutrition Project    and execution of process elements with unusual devotion    preparation of BINP as was done in the case of TINP-1. A detailed&#13;

center; and a management information system to rapidly&#13;
detect performance falling below norms.&#13;
3. One area in which TINP was less effective was in       3. TINP was carried out through the Department of Social Welfare,&#13;
ensuring coordination with the health services. Large-scale    while the health workers at the grass-root level belonged to the&#13;
investment in health infrastructure and supplies is not   Department of Health. This was largely responsible for the lack of&#13;
sufficient to improve performance. Complementary          coordination between the project and the health program. Taking&#13;
measures are needed on the software side.                 this lesson into account, BINP is being placed in the Ministry of&#13;
Health and Family Welfare and considerable thought has been given&#13;
to establishing linkages with the health program activities.&#13;

Selection Criteria - Sites for Coimunity-Based Nutrition Component&#13;
1.        Select at least one district per division, to allow testing in&#13;
different environments.&#13;
2.        Cover about half the thanas in a given project district:&#13;
(a) to permit selection of thanas with appropriate conditions (see 3-7&#13;
below);&#13;
(b) to allow for competition between thanas for entry into the project;&#13;
and&#13;
(c) to allow a reasonable number of districts to be in the project,&#13;
while avoiding scatter all over the country. In practice, for a 40&#13;
thana project, this would mean about 8 districts.&#13;
3.        Choose districts and thanas representing a range of grades of food&#13;
distress, as defined by the methodology of WFP, which employs a combination of&#13;
socio-economic and ecological factors.&#13;
4.        Districts, and thanas within districts, which are most disaster-&#13;
prone will be avoided, since this project is not designed to cope with post-&#13;
disaster malnutrition. Regions which are particularly prone to flood or&#13;
cyclone would be ruled out if the probability of occurrence is likely to&#13;
undermine project effectiveness.&#13;
5.        To be eligible, thanas must have a basic health infrastructure,&#13;
i.e. a properly staffed THC with in-patient beds and full or near full&#13;
coverage of staffed FWCs. Presence of government or non-government nutrition&#13;
activities would also be desirable.&#13;
6.        Thanas with and without the PHC intensification program should be&#13;
included in the project.&#13;
7.        only thanas with at least 80% of infants fully immunized will be&#13;
included. This is both a sign of effective health care outreach and of&#13;
community willingness to participate in such programs.&#13;
Thanas within a district which satisfied the above criteria would compete for&#13;
entry to the project based on interest in the project and willingness to&#13;
contribute local resources. Possible local contributions might be: a place&#13;
for training CNPs; a share of the honorarium of the local CNP; a site and&#13;
labor to build a village nutrition center; a share of the supplementary food,&#13;
in cash or kind; a commitment to seek, through the inter-sectoral component,&#13;
assistance to improve the food security of the families of severely&#13;
malnourished children. The mechanism of competition of thanas for entry into&#13;
the project will be developed by the Government, in agreement with IDA, during&#13;
the first two years of the project.&#13;

INTEGRATED NUTRITION PROJECT&#13;
Program Development and Institution Building&#13;
1.        Any national initiative to mitigate the problem of malnutrition can&#13;
only be sustained if a strong political commitment is in place and efforts to&#13;
build the national institutional capacity are accorded a high priority. The&#13;
political commitment has to be translated into an effective national program&#13;
which highlights the significance of nutrition in the context of overall&#13;
development and recognizes the imminence of the need to solve the nutrition&#13;
problem without waiting for improvements in socio-economic status which are&#13;
likely to take a long time to take effect and will not automatically eliminate&#13;
malnutrition.&#13;
2.        One of the first steps in this direction is to consolidate the&#13;
progress made so far in terms of the draft national nutrition policy which has&#13;
already undergone several iterations; more important than giving the policy an&#13;
official status is to obtain consensus on the content of the future program.&#13;
Other important actions which are necessary for program development and&#13;
institution building are: the development of a critical mass of human&#13;
resources at the national level with a high degree of expertise and the&#13;
promotion of appropriate research that can stimulate and feed into an&#13;
effective national nutrition program.&#13;
3.        The Prime Minister has provided the lead for a strong national&#13;
nutrition program by agreeing to chair the nutrition council and promoting the&#13;
aspiration of "Daal Bhat" for everyone. This initiative still needs to be&#13;
expanded to include nutritional aspects and then operationalized.&#13;
Institutional review and streamlining of roles:&#13;
4.        The project provides for a comprehensive review of the current&#13;
roles and capacities of existing national level institutions/agencies which&#13;
undertake various types of activities related to nutrition. Some such&#13;
institutions are the Bangladesh National Nutrition Council (BNNC), the&#13;
Institute of Public Health Nutrition (IPHN), Institute of Nutrition and Food&#13;
Sciences (INFS) in the Dhaka University, Institute of Food Sciences and&#13;
Technology (IFST) in the Bangladesh Council for Scientific and Industrial&#13;
Research, and the Institute for Mother and Child Health (IMCH), being&#13;
developed under the Fourth Population and Health Project. The review would&#13;
consider NGOs and private institutions as well. The review would be&#13;
undertaken by independent professional experts experienced in carrying out&#13;
organizational reviews. The timeframe within which it is to be completed has&#13;
been agreed as before the end of 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
5.        The purpose of the review would be to recommend ways to strengthen&#13;
institutional capacity in the field of nutrition and to streamline the roles&#13;
and mandates of each institution avoiding duplication and confusion.&#13;
Human Resources for Nutrition - National Level:&#13;
6.        A solid human resources base is an essential prerequisite for any&#13;
national program to succeed. This component will attempt to develop a core&#13;
group of nutrition experts at the national level who would not only be well-&#13;
versed with the latest advances in the technical areas related to nutrition&#13;
but also aware of the programmatic issues and experiences, both national and&#13;
international.&#13;
7.        Workshops and training sessions, for nutrition focal points and&#13;
senior policy makers in the relevant line ministries will be run on a regular&#13;
basis. The main purpose of these workshops would be to create an understanding&#13;
of the conceptual framework of nutrition causality to provide an update on the&#13;
recent developments both in the field of nutrition and in nutrition related&#13;
projects around the world and encourage non-health sectors to develop&#13;
activities related to the improvement of nutritional status within their own&#13;
projects. These workshops will be organized by the Project Directorate with&#13;
the involvement of appropriate private or public institutions with the&#13;
relevant expertise.&#13;
8.        Other activities under this Subcomponent will include international&#13;
scholarships, appropriate curriculum development for existing and new courses&#13;
to be conducted by IPHN, INFS, IFST and other national institutions which are&#13;
likely to be involved in nutrition.&#13;
9.        The project also includes a technical cooperation arrangement&#13;
between GOB and the Institute of Nutrition, Mahidol University (INMU),&#13;
Thailand. This arrangement will, inter alia, provide for the twinning of a&#13;
national level nutrition institution in Bangladesh with INMU, thus allowing&#13;
for exchange of visits, fellowships and other modalities of transfer of&#13;
technology.&#13;
Research Promotion&#13;
10.       Essentially, two types of research will be pursued in the pre-&#13;
project phase and in the project: policy research and operational research.&#13;
A. Policy Research&#13;
11.       Research will be undertaken to guide the development of a National&#13;
Nutrition Program. The major areas of research will include: (a) analysis of&#13;
budgetary expenditures to identify nutrition related inputs; (b) continuing&#13;
research on food policy and its effects on food distribution and household&#13;
food security; (c) studies on the policy related determinants of malnutrition&#13;
among women, including studies on caloric expenditure; (d) studies on food&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
consumption behaviors, intra-family distribution of food, feeding practices,&#13;
and other caring activities that impact nutritional status; (e) studies on&#13;
production and employment patterns and their impact on the nutritional status.&#13;
12.       This list is not exhaustive and will be developed further as more&#13;
areas of concern and relevance are identified. The research agenda will be set&#13;
out by consultation between BNNC, MOHFW, the Prime Minister's office and other&#13;
interested parties. Research will be commissioned and funded by the Project&#13;
Director and will be carried out by reputable organizations in the private and&#13;
public sectors.&#13;
B. Operational Research&#13;
13.       The major focus of the operational research will be on the&#13;
implementation of community based nutrition interventions. Research will&#13;
determine the feasibility of selected approaches and will continue as needed&#13;
throughout the duration of the project. The research agenda for this&#13;
particular component will include areas of implementation, management and&#13;
impact of food subsidies, impact of communication activities, development of&#13;
effective means of community involvement, the role of local agencies,&#13;
including non-governmental organizations. While not strictly a research&#13;
activity, a comprehensive baseline study is required, including both&#13;
quantitative and qualitative indicators of the determinants of malnutrition.&#13;
This study would be carried out by a national institution which would then&#13;
follow through with further research activities to determine change, impact or&#13;
failure.&#13;
14.       The second major area for operational research will be in the field&#13;
of nutrition education and communication. Formative research will be required&#13;
to determine the methodology and contents of a nutrition communications&#13;
strategy, based on current behaviors, attitudes and perceptions of the target&#13;
audience. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the impact of IEC on&#13;
nutrition.&#13;
15.       The third area of research will be intersectoral. Research will&#13;
determine the most appropriate approaches to nutrition rehabilitation; school&#13;
health programs; nutritional surveillance and monitoring both nationally and&#13;
in selected communities at risk; identification and coordination of various&#13;
sectoral activities that impact on nutrition.&#13;
16.       Further possible areas for operational research include: food&#13;
fortification with micronutrients, the development of an urban nutrition&#13;
strategy, and food quality assurance issues.&#13;
Strenqthening of the Banaladesh National Nutrition Council (BNNC)&#13;
17.       In the past BNNC has met infrequently, and its secretariat has not&#13;
had adequate staff with the required expertise. One of the sub-components&#13;
under the Fourth Population and Health Project (FPHP) provides the necessary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
finances to strengthen BNNC in this regard. Funds are also being provided for&#13;
supporting BNNC in terms of physical facilities and technical assistance.&#13;
C. The Secretariat of the Bangladesh National Nutrition Council&#13;
18.       The Secretariat of BNNC once considerably strengthened with senior&#13;
professional capability, would be in a position to provide the Ministry of&#13;
Health and Family Welfare and other line Ministries with the necessary advice&#13;
on the development and implementation of nutrition components. The Prime&#13;
Minister's office and Planning Commission will both require technical support&#13;
on the feasibility and appropriateness of nutrition related projects proposed&#13;
by line Ministries. NGOs and other private sector organizations involved in&#13;
nutrition will benefit from clear advice and leadership in developing cost-&#13;
effective nutrition interventions. For this purpose in addition to the inputs&#13;
provided for under FPHP, this Project may contribute further resources to BNNC&#13;
as may be necessary. As a minimum it is expected that four technically&#13;
competent and experienced individuals will be needed in addition to an&#13;
experienced and competent manager who would lead the BNNC Secretariat.&#13;
19.       In view of the need for considerable efforts to be put into the&#13;
community based nutrition interventions, IEC, project monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, the technical strengthening of BNNC should correspond to these&#13;
areas of expertise. Specific technical assistance (through consultancies) will&#13;
be required from project preparation stage and should therefore be funded&#13;
prior to the effective date of the nutrition project possibly through FPHP.&#13;
Given the diversity of the tasks involved in designing and implementing a&#13;
community based nutrition project it is likely that in the initial phases and&#13;
intermittently throughout the project there will be an additional need for&#13;
short term consultancies. The consultants and project personnel will work&#13;
closely with the existing staff of the BNNC, IPHN and MOHFW.&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
INTEGRATED NUTRITION PROJECT&#13;
Information, Education and Communication (IEC)&#13;
1.        The component on IEC development has been included mainly to&#13;
develop messages and materials for use in the project, though these materials&#13;
could be used in nutrition activities outside the project thanas as well.&#13;
This component would be managed by the Deputy Project Director (IEC) within&#13;
the Project Office at the central level, but the actual tasks of formative&#13;
research, message development and material production would be contracted out&#13;
to the private sector. The media for delivering nutrition messages would be&#13;
varied - from interpersonal (counseling) to mass media. The former method&#13;
will be the primary one through the Community-Based Nutrition Component&#13;
(CBNC); thus the two components will work in a complementary fashion - the IEC&#13;
component developing messages and CBNC delivering them. The message delivery&#13;
through mass media would be done within this component itself.&#13;
Framework for Nutrition IEC Strategy&#13;
2.        The development of an overall national nutrition IEC strategy that&#13;
builds on successful experiences and establishes linkages with other IEC&#13;
initiatives in Bangladesh is one of the institutional goals of this project.&#13;
One such strategy that has been adopted in Bangladesh is based on&#13;
participatory processes which involve the elements of advocacy for national&#13;
commitment, social mobilization for partnership building and community&#13;
participation, and program communication to foster specific behavior change.&#13;
The IEC component of the proposed project will adopt this model as basis for&#13;
the development and refinements of community nutrition program IEC strategy.&#13;
3.        Advocacy consists of the organization of information to arrive at&#13;
greater consensus on the basic, underlying and immediate causes of&#13;
malnutrition and appropriate actions which should be taken to address these&#13;
problems, with a view to gaining political commitment and social leadership&#13;
for a nutrition program. This is expected to result in the development of a&#13;
nutrition policy, adequate resource allocation for the program and proper&#13;
positioning of nutrition in the overall development goals of the country. The&#13;
channels for advocacy in nutrition could include a whole range of activities&#13;
such as national conferences, workshops, speeches, special events,&#13;
appearances, field visits, newspaper coverage, magazine articles, special&#13;
publications, interactive video, general programming on TV and radio targeted&#13;
to policy makers, program planners and the general public.&#13;
4.        In the preparation of this project, a series of consensus building&#13;
workshops involving key policy-makers and program planners were conducted with&#13;
UNICEF assistance which generated a high level of awareness about the&#13;
malnutrition problem and strong political commitment to solving it. This&#13;
project will continue to support nutrition advocacy to broaden and expand this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
Ainex 4&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
political commitment at the national and local levels for implementation of a&#13;
community-based intervention and inter-sectoral programs which can feed back&#13;
into a responsive national nutrition policy.&#13;
5.        Social mobilization is the process of bringing together all&#13;
feasible and practical inter-sectoral allies to raise people's awareness of&#13;
and demand for a nutrition program, to assist in the delivery of resources and&#13;
services and to strengthen community participation for sustainability and&#13;
self-reliance. First, it includes government mobilization aimed at informing&#13;
and enlisting the cooperation and help of service providers and other&#13;
government organizations which can provide direct or indirect support. This&#13;
will be done through training programs, study visits and coverage of the&#13;
subject by the mass media. Second, community mobilization is geared at&#13;
informing and gaining the commitment of local political, religious, social and&#13;
traditional leaders as well as local government agencies, NGOs, women's groups&#13;
and cooperatives. The methods to be employed include orientation seminars,&#13;
participation in planning and media coverage to gather and disseminate&#13;
information on the expected benefits of a successful nutrition program and to&#13;
muster support for community level demand creation and partnerships.&#13;
6.        Project preparation for social mobilization will include an&#13;
analysis of who and where the potential partners are, and a participatory&#13;
definition of their respective roles in the nutrition program. This exercise&#13;
can include a series of workshops at the district, thana and union level&#13;
through a process known as VIPP or Visualization In Participatory Planning&#13;
(Attachment A). This methodology will be tested at the Thana and union level&#13;
to determine its appropriate use in consensus building on the malnutrition&#13;
problem which has also vast implications for the management, logistics&#13;
support, training and monitoring of CBNC. Initial workshops will help&#13;
organize representative bodies or implementing structures at all levels,&#13;
develop guidelines on coordinated involvement, reach agreements on priority&#13;
targets and conditionalities for access to various services such as GMP, care&#13;
of teenage girls, pregnant and lactating mothers, homestead gardens, food&#13;
distribution schemes, income generation and health services that are/will be&#13;
available in the project areas.&#13;
7.        Mobilization and demand creation for nutrition and other inter-&#13;
sectoral services will also be promoted for the program beneficiaries through&#13;
special campaigns, establishment of community discussion groups aided by&#13;
traditional or mass media and interpersonal communication. It should be based&#13;
on an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the community's social,&#13;
cultural and economic realities. It should be planned and tested for&#13;
feasibility to ensure that demand created for nutrition and other programs in&#13;
the mobilizing process is met. A protocol for introducing CBNC into the&#13;
community will be developed and refined during the first year of project&#13;
implementation for use in subsequent project expansion.&#13;
8.        It is important that the process of social mobilization be&#13;
monitored and project management will develop some indicators in this regard.&#13;
An illustrative set of qualitative indicators is given in Annex 13 as a guide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
to determine that institutionalization, capacity building, coordination and&#13;
integration are taking place.&#13;
9.        Program communication includes the process of identifying,&#13;
segmenting and targeting specific groups/audiences with particular strategies,&#13;
materials, messages or training programs through varioUs media and&#13;
interpersonal channels, traditional or non-traditional. It incorporates some&#13;
concepts of social marketing which include behavior change as the ultimate&#13;
product, a price tag of malnutrition in terms of social cost, missed&#13;
opportunities for productivity and intellectual achievement, and the careful&#13;
design, development and delivery of the messages through formative evaluation.&#13;
This model also embraces a cyclical model of applied communication which&#13;
allows flexibility and refinements based on new information received about the&#13;
expressed perceptions and changing needs of the target audience. The conduct&#13;
of formative research, strategy and design development, materials development,&#13;
implementation and evaluation will be repeated for different themes of the&#13;
program. Initially, program communication themes for social mobilization and&#13;
GMP will be developed. It is expected that by the end of first year&#13;
implementation, a proposal for the second round of formative research will be&#13;
developed according to program needs.&#13;
Formative Evaluation&#13;
10.       The first round of formative research for program communication is&#13;
a requisite activity to be concluded before the project begins. It is&#13;
important that no production of communications materials will be made before a&#13;
formative research is completed.&#13;
11.       Adequate quantitative information and recent studies of family&#13;
practices including existing feeding patterns of children 0-36 months and&#13;
pregnant/lactating mothers are available in Bangladesh which can be used in&#13;
the preparation of formative research. Some special studies to determine&#13;
specific feeding patterns of the vulnerable groups in different ecological&#13;
zones and socio-economic groupings in the project areas may be conducted if&#13;
not enough information is yet known, particularly on the types of foods&#13;
introduced at various ages, ways of feeding young children, factors and&#13;
persons influencing those patterns.&#13;
12.       The problem identification will be initiated by a review of&#13;
literature and careful analysis of factors which promote or hinder the health&#13;
and nutrition of the vulnerable groups. It will be followed by qualitative&#13;
studies to be contracted to a research firm for an in-depth analysis of what&#13;
mothers actually do, why they practice the observed behaviors and the&#13;
important determinants of these behaviors. Participant observation, focus&#13;
group discussions and in-depth interviews will be carried out to obtain such&#13;
information and to explore the feasibility of improving those practices with&#13;
existing family resources. The findings will be used to formulate action-&#13;
oriented objectives for distinct audiences and messages will be designed,&#13;
field tested, revised and will become the basis for nutrition IEC activities.&#13;

The resulting communications strategy will be tested for first year&#13;
implementation with continuous fine tuning as the project is scaled up.&#13;
Communication and Material Development&#13;
13.       The media production called for in the initial communications&#13;
strategy will be contracted out to appropriate production firms. The design&#13;
and strategy developed from the formative research will guide and direct&#13;
writers, artists and production personnel to prepare messages and materials&#13;
for each target audience. The weighing of all children 0-2 years and&#13;
supplementary feeding of those who are growth faltering and non-feeding of&#13;
those who are growing normally will be the central motivation factor and&#13;
communication focus in growth monitoring and promotion. Audience segmentation&#13;
will require modifications to messages accordingly. Messages will be focused&#13;
on feasible and easy to practice behavioral changes which will have positive&#13;
effect on child growth. The messages will also reinforce positive practices&#13;
while seeking to change negative ones. The emphasis for the child will be on&#13;
giving colostrum and exclusive breastfeeding, introducing appropriate semi-&#13;
solids after 6 months, supplementary feeding for growth faltering children and&#13;
feeding during illness. For mothers the emphasis will be on the need for&#13;
additional food and liquid intake during pregnancy and lactation.&#13;
14.       The media plan will include packaging of messages into attractive&#13;
discussion guidelines, curricula, teaching aids, handouts, radio and TV&#13;
messages, and field worker materials to match audiences, program needs and the&#13;
identified effective delivery channels. The standard procedure for materials&#13;
development for the prototype messages will be carried out with pretesting and&#13;
revising as required, and in consultation with the appropriate authorities.&#13;
15.       After developing the final messages, relevant groups will be&#13;
oriented and trained to use the materials and conduct the IEC activities.&#13;
These will be complemented by actions in the service delivery front. Various&#13;
channels will be used to repeat key messages. CBNC supervision plan will&#13;
include actions to monitor and supervise IEC activities adequately.&#13;
Evaluation&#13;
16.       An evaluation to show actual changes in behavior and impact on&#13;
nutritional status will be designed. This will include (a) an initial&#13;
baseline study, (b) monitoring/tracking studies, as appropriate and (c) final&#13;
or summative evaluation.&#13;

Visualization in Participatory Planning (VIPP)&#13;
1.        Most workshops, seminars and training sessions in Bangladesh and&#13;
other countries are essentially formal affairs where participants are required&#13;
to listen to a large number of speeches from a dais set rigidly before rows of&#13;
chairs or a board room style table. Hierarchical relationships are strictly&#13;
adhered to. Speakers come with fixed positions on various subject matter and&#13;
attempt to pass on information in lectures, relying on their wit and charm to&#13;
keep audiences receptive. Very often discussion sessions consist of another&#13;
series of formal speeches with little or no feedback. Much of the content of&#13;
speeches is lost to audiences.&#13;
2.        The methodology used in VIPP is a direct attempt to break down a&#13;
passive "seminar culture". Although many people may be familiar with&#13;
participatory methods, VIPP is different. It relies on the preparation of a&#13;
large number of cards of different shapes, made from art paper of different&#13;
colors, on which the participants express their main ideas in large enough&#13;
letters or diagrams to be seen by the whole group. Private note taking is not&#13;
allowed. Participants are asked to stick to the rule of one idea per card.&#13;
They are asked to synthesize their thoughts, or the thought of others, on&#13;
these cards and to display the cards on moveable boards.&#13;
3.        By this method, everyone takes part in the process of arriving at a&#13;
consensus. Less talkative participants find a means of expression and those&#13;
who might normally dominate a group lose control and are forced to let others&#13;
have their say. By visualizing the group's main proceedings, repetition and&#13;
circularity in arguments are reduced. If there is a record of the group's&#13;
progress, visible to everyone, it is easier to point out such repetition.&#13;
4.        The rule of one idea per card is important.  Flip charts with long&#13;
lists of ideas allow only part of the group process to be visible at one time.&#13;
Some of the ideas are flipped out of sight. It is possible to pin or tape&#13;
flip chart paper to a wall or board. However, it is difficult to separate&#13;
individual ideas, move ideas to other groupings or categories or to collapse&#13;
the ideas of two sub-groups, ruling out redundancy. If there is one idea per&#13;
card, all of this is possible. Individuals and sub-groups can identify their&#13;
own work and see how it fits in with the thoughts of the group as a whole.&#13;
5.        Finally, with this methodology, it is not necessary to take&#13;
extensive notes. The proceedings of the workshop, visible to all, can be&#13;
photographed an a report written from them.&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
INTEGRATED NUTRITION PROJECT&#13;
Strengthening Existing Nutrition Activities&#13;
The assessment of UNICEF and the project preparation missions showed that&#13;
current activities on vitamin A supplementation and iodine supplementation to&#13;
populations at risk need improvements in their management and effectiveness&#13;
but no additional resource requirements were identified. However, additional&#13;
resources were found to be necessary to strengthen the activities on the&#13;
control of nutritional anemia and on the promotion of breast-feeding.&#13;
Therefore, this component will primarily finance these two sets of activities.&#13;
This annex provides draft proposals on both these activities. (In the case of&#13;
vitamin A and iodine, some strengthening could be done within the framework of&#13;
CBNC in its thanas).&#13;
Control of Nutritional Anaemia&#13;
1.   Background/problem statements:&#13;
1.1       Nutritional anaemia is a serious public health problem in&#13;
Bangladesh. Although anaemia is widespread in the country, it specially&#13;
affects women in the reproductive age group and young children. Nutrition&#13;
Survey of rural Bangladesh 1981-82 shows about 50% pregnant and lactating&#13;
women are anaemic. Recent analysis of data of 393 pregnant women from MCHTI-&#13;
Azimpur shows that only 0.5% pregnant women in their third trimester had&#13;
haemoglobin level above normal value (11 gm/dl or above). Remaining 99.5%&#13;
suffered from anaemia of which 66% falls under severely anaemic category&#13;
having haemoglobin level 8 gm/dl or less.&#13;
1.2       Nutritional anaemia due to Iron Folic Acid deficiency, is directly&#13;
or indirectly responsible for about 20% of maternal deaths in Bangladesh.&#13;
Anaemia is also a major contributory cause of high incidence of prematurity,&#13;
low birth weight, postpartum hemorrhage and perinatal morbidity and mortality.&#13;
Improved haemoglobin levels in the blood would reduce tissue anoxia caused by&#13;
hemorrhage and may well reduce death due to hemorrhage. Furthermore, one gram&#13;
increase in haemoglobin level per 100 ml of blood had been reported to&#13;
increase the birth weight of a child by 50 gm. Improvement in anaemic status&#13;
among labor force increases their work output and productivity.&#13;
1.3       Existing programme to control anemia at national level lacks clear&#13;
policy guideline, operation details and coordination among various&#13;
implementing agencies resulting unsatisfactory coverage and impact.&#13;
2.        Goals and Obiectives: The goal for control of anaemia for BINP has&#13;
been developed in line with the International Conference on Nutrition and the&#13;
World Summit for the Children goal and as national target to be reached by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 2 of 15&#13;
year 2000. The goal has been set as realistic one to be achieved in about&#13;
project life within areas where project activities will be carried out.&#13;
Goal: Reduction of iron deficiency anaemia among children&#13;
and pregnant and lactating women.&#13;
This particular project will also contribute in partly reduction of following&#13;
nutrition goals set for the nation:&#13;
(a) Reduction of the rate of low birth weight by half;&#13;
(b) Improvement of maternal nutritional status during pregnancy;&#13;
(c) Reduction in infant mortality rate.&#13;
3.   Strategies:  Considering the magnitude and the seriousness of the&#13;
problem, the immediate and longer term actions are required to:&#13;
3.1       Directly attack the problem, targetting to the most vulnerable&#13;
groups within operation areas particularly among pregnant and lactating women&#13;
instead of blanket coverage for total population;&#13;
3.2       A sustained improvement in the anaemia status by a more holistic&#13;
and intersectoral approach along with other components of the project,&#13;
particularly through intersectoral activities.&#13;
3.3       Specific strategies:&#13;
(a) Clear targetting strategies for supplementation;&#13;
(b) Establishing an effective coordination with CBNC and intersectoral&#13;
activities;&#13;
(c) Establish linkages and effective referral system with existing&#13;
health facilities/outlets at project operation areas;&#13;
(d) Operation research on alternative approaches.&#13;
4.   Interventions:&#13;
4.1       Iron and Folic acid supplementation to all pregnant and lactating&#13;
women (PLW) in the project areas:&#13;
(a) among admitted group for supplementary feeding in the nutrition&#13;
centres;&#13;
(b) all other PLW while they encounter with other health facilities&#13;
during ante and post natal visits;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 3 of 15&#13;
Recommended doses:&#13;
(i) For pregnant and lactating women - 60 mg of iron and 250 mg of&#13;
folate twice daily OR&#13;
(ii) Same doses twice weekly.&#13;
4.2       Treatment of severe anaemia with injectable form of iron.  Women&#13;
with severe anaemia (&lt; 8 gm/dl) will be referred to nearest health facility&#13;
(Family Welfare Centre) for treatment.&#13;
4.3       Promote increase intake of iron and Vitamin C containing foods&#13;
through health education while they will be admitted in the feeding centres on&#13;
relevant topics.&#13;
4.4       Training for Nutrition workers and other health worker where&#13;
necessary.&#13;
*    Ensure the training manual/module for nutrition workers contain&#13;
appropriate information viz. effect of anaemia on pregnant &amp;&#13;
lactating mothers, prevention through consumption of iron rich&#13;
foods and iron supplementation dose for supplementation,&#13;
identification, and referral of severely anaemic women.&#13;
*    Incorporation of these topics into ongoing and future training&#13;
courses for health and family planning workers.&#13;
4.5       Operations research:  Some reasons for non-success of&#13;
supplementation and non-compliance to treatment are thought to be&#13;
gastrointestinal side effects and failure to take regular daily doses. The&#13;
frequency of side effects are related to the dose of iron. Weekly doses might&#13;
be better tolerated, and improve compliance rate. Provision would be kept in&#13;
the project to try out both options (regular daily dose and bi-weekly doses)&#13;
in different thanas before universalization of one method.&#13;
S.        Management:  Following service outlets of Health &amp; Family Planning&#13;
Directorate would be used:&#13;
5.1       Satellite/Outreach Sites:  For pregnant and lactating women not&#13;
admitted in feeding centre:&#13;
(a) During 1st dose of TT: one month supply (60 tablets)&#13;
(b) During 2nd or booster dose of TT: two to three months supply (120-&#13;
180 tablets) depending on the month of pregnancy when 2nd or&#13;
booster dose is received. This include one month supply for 1st&#13;
month of lactation.&#13;
(c) During 1st dose of DPT: One month supply (60 tablets) to mothers&#13;
those who accompany their children for 1st dose of DPT.&#13;

5.3       Family Welfare Centre and UHC:&#13;
(a) One month supply (60 tablets) during each contact for antenatal and&#13;
postnatal check-up.&#13;
(b) Treatment for severe anaemia.&#13;
6.        Supply:&#13;
6.1       Satellite/Outreach sites, FWC and UHC: From Health and Family&#13;
Planning Directorate in EPI plus Kit and FWC D&amp;DS Kit.&#13;
6.2       Packaging: 30 and 60 tablets in a polythene self sealing bag marked&#13;
for pregnant and lactating mothers from nutrition centre and other outlets&#13;
respectively.&#13;
7.        Cost: Project envisage a total cost of US$6200 for each thana.  In&#13;
addition a total of US$350,000 would be required for training/communication&#13;
and research. The cost is based on following assumptions:&#13;
(a) Four percent of the total population is pregnant at one point of&#13;
time;&#13;
(b) One third of the anaemic cases are in severe form (&lt;8 mg/dl) who&#13;
would require therapeutic treatment by injectable iron;&#13;
(c) Coverage rate would be 80% through various health and nutrition&#13;
outlets;&#13;
(d)  1000 tablets cost US$1.6 (UNIPAC, Copenhagen rate)&#13;
(e) All cases including severe form would require total 250 tablets per&#13;
women treated for a period of total 4 months.&#13;

9.    Brief Description&#13;
Breastfeeding is the traditional way of child feeding in Bangladesh&#13;
although practices deviate far from optimal. In 50% cases BF is&#13;
initiated at 48-72 hours after delivery. Colostrum is discarded in 2&#13;
out of 3 cases and practices of pre-lacteal feeding (honey, sugar water,&#13;
cow's milk water and mustard oil etc.) is almost universal. Exclusive&#13;
breastfeeding declines rapidly from 60% at birth to 5% at 5 months.&#13;
Proper and healthy Weaning practice at right time with appropriate food&#13;
are rarely done. The non ethical marketing of breastmilk substitutes&#13;
(BMS) through media and the health professionals are sources of&#13;
misinformation including beastfeeding practices. All milk powders are&#13;
considered as breastmilk substitutes and bought whenever it could be&#13;
afforded by the parents. The use of BMS is more prevalent in urban&#13;
areas. The medical institutions and health professionals are commonly&#13;
found to support unethical/practices of BMS in the hospitals/clinics and&#13;
private practices. In 1991 rooming-in was found universal for hospital&#13;
delivered babies, exclusive breastfeeding for this group was virtually&#13;
unknown. Only 2% of mothers of hospital delivered babies were advised&#13;
properly about breastfeeding.&#13;
Concerned with this situation the Campaign for protection &amp; promotion of&#13;
Breastfeeding (CPPBF) was established as a voluntary and idealistic net&#13;
work in April, 1989 by a group of professionals from medical&#13;
Institutions, government agencies, U.N. agencies, NGOs with the active&#13;
support from UNICEF. CPPBF is the focal point for all breastfeeding&#13;
&#13;

activities in Bangladesh. Programs are implemented by the member of a&#13;
National Executive and six subcommittees through government agencies&#13;
with active partnership with NGOs. It has a skeletal staff forming the&#13;
secretariat to implement the activities.&#13;
9.        The Goal of Campaign for the Protection &amp; Promotion of&#13;
Breastfeeding (CPPBF): The single goal of the Campaign is to significantly&#13;
lower the morbidity and mortality of children and women in Bangladesh through&#13;
successful breastfeeding.&#13;
10.       The Objectives:&#13;
(a) To achieve and sustain universal exclusive breastfeeding for the&#13;
first six months ensuring colostrum for all babies.&#13;
(b) To improve the weaning practices and encourage the continuation of,&#13;
breastfeeding for 2 years or more.&#13;
(c) To improve the nutritional status of pregnant and lactating&#13;
mothers.&#13;
11.       The following are the principal Project activities:&#13;
(a) Formulating and disseminating a National Breastfeeding Policy for&#13;
maternity/health care facilities.&#13;
(b) Advocacy and mobilization of key professionals and allies -&#13;
professionals bodies, women's group, NGO, GOB departments and donor&#13;
agencies.&#13;
(c) Institution of "Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative in hospitals&#13;
providing Maternity Services.&#13;
(d) Strict enforcement of law prohibiting free and subsidized supply of&#13;
Breast Milk Substitutes (BMS) in all health facilities.&#13;
(e) Comprehensive planning for all health service providers (GOB as&#13;
well as NGO).&#13;
(f) Under taking relevant Research.&#13;
(g) Communication for the promotion of BFHI, exclusive breastfeeding&#13;
and appropriate weaning.&#13;
(h) Tradition for Creation of "Mother Friendly Work" place for the&#13;
Working Women.&#13;

Background/Problem Statement&#13;
11.       Problem:&#13;
11.1      Breastfeeding is the traditional way of childfeeding in Bangladesh&#13;
although the practices deviate far from optimal. Breastfeeding is initiated&#13;
in 50% of the cases between 48 and 712 hours when the mother feels "the milk&#13;
has come in". Colostrum is discarded in majority cases and feeding of&#13;
prelactial feeds in the form of honey, sugar, water, mustard oil, cow's milk,&#13;
is almost universal. Exclusive breastfeeding is non-existing, water is given&#13;
in almost cent percent cases. Proper weaning practices in terms of right time&#13;
appropriate food and amount are absent. Semi-solid foods are introduced&#13;
before 4 months of age among one fifth of the infants. About one third&#13;
infants are given solid food at the age of 6-12 months. The type of&#13;
complementary foods given are usually rice gruel which lacks in energy&#13;
density. the frequency and amount are not enough to meet the requirement of&#13;
the growing baby. The total duration of breastfeeding is shorter among urban&#13;
elites. At 12 months 20 percent of the urban elites continued breastfeeding&#13;
compared to 30 percent of poor urban and 80 percent of the rural children&#13;
continued breastfeeding at 24 months.&#13;
11.2      The non ethical marketing of breastmilk substitutes (BMS) through&#13;
media campaign and health professionals are amongst the major sources of&#13;
misinformation for patents. all milk powders are considered as BMS and is&#13;
bought whenever it can be afforded. The use of BMS is more prevalent in urban&#13;
areas. Many medical institutions and professionals use or prescribe BMS&#13;
indiscriminately.&#13;
11.3      Government's Commitment to the Campaign and Global Goal: The Goal&#13;
for Campaign for the Protection and Promotion of Breastfeeding (CPPBF) in&#13;
Bangladesh is to empower all women to breast feed their children exclusively&#13;
for six months and to continue breastfeeding, with complementary food, well in&#13;
to second year. This goal was adapted globally in the World Summit for&#13;
Children in 1990, which subsequently was ratified by the Government of&#13;
Bangladesh. The strategy to achieve this goal the "Baby Friendly Hospital&#13;
Initiative (BFHI)" has been promoted globally by UNICEF and WHO in June 1991.&#13;
The Government of Bangladesh has shown its political commitment by signing the&#13;
"Dhaka Declaration" by the hon'ble Prime Minister, the hon'ble President and&#13;
hon'ble Minister of Health and Family Welfare pledging the support, protect&#13;
and promote breastfeeding.&#13;
11.4      To achieve the Goal for breastfeeding in Bangladesh the GOB with&#13;
the assistance from UNICEF has fixed a "Mid-Decade" goal to make all hospitals&#13;
(162) having Maternity Services "Baby Friendly" by ending free and low cost&#13;
supplies of infant formula and Breast Milk Substitute by 1995. It is further&#13;
proposed to cover by the year 2000, 700 hospitals/health facilities including&#13;
Thana Health Complexes - providing Maternity Services.&#13;

11.5      Campaign for the Promotion and Protection of Breastfeeding (CPPBF):&#13;
Breastfeeding Promotion in Bangladesh has become active since a&#13;
Working Group consisting professionals from Government, NGO, and individuals&#13;
met regularly since 1989. Subsequently the CPPBF was created in January 1991&#13;
by the initiative of UNICEF and a group of volunteers of professionals from&#13;
Government, Medical Institution and NGO's. Since then CPPBF is considered as&#13;
the focal point for all breastfeeding activities in Bangladesh. It now&#13;
functions as the central authority on Breastfeeding in Bangladesh.&#13;
11.6      CPPBF has a structure of one Executive Committee supported by other&#13;
six sub-committees. All members of the executive and sub-committee work as&#13;
volunteer. The members of the Executive Committee met at least once in a&#13;
month and decide on policy issues and day to day implementation of the various&#13;
programs. The six sub-committees implement the activities as outlined in the&#13;
annual work plan. The day to day activities and the management of various&#13;
programs are under taken by the skeletal staff forming the CPPBF Secretariat -&#13;
which provides:&#13;
(a)  the meeting facilities for the executive and sub-committees;&#13;
(b)  acts as an information enter for resource papers and publication on&#13;
breastfeeding;&#13;
(c)  acts as distribution point for communication material; and&#13;
(d)  provides the secretarial support and coordinates the various&#13;
programs.&#13;
11.7      Relation with Government Program:&#13;
(a)  The CPPBF activities are covered under the Community Food and&#13;
Nutrition Program of the Institute of Public Health Nutrition.&#13;
(b)  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for ensuring&#13;
that the hospitals under their care (at national, district and&#13;
subdistrict levels) are "Baby Friendly". NGO's undertake advocacy&#13;
for exclusive breastfeeding. Professional bodies including doctors&#13;
and nurses associations are promoting the changes necessary in the&#13;
institutions under their jurisdiction, and undertaking training of&#13;
other health personnel.&#13;
12.       Financing of CPPBF:&#13;
12.1      Since inception CPPBF remained under the umbrella of UNICEF which&#13;
has been the single source of all financial support for:&#13;
(a) The various activities/programs;&#13;
&#13;

(b)  Salary for the staff and consultants;&#13;
(c)  Establishment cost of the CPPBF Secretariat.&#13;
13.       Future Plan:&#13;
13.1      It has been decided by the Executive Committee that CPPBF will be&#13;
turned in to a "Trust". The status of Trust will permit CPPBF to accept funds&#13;
from other sources. It would turn into financially independent organization&#13;
to have better scope for planning, implementing and monitoring of its program.&#13;
It is expected that by 1995 the "Trust" will be fully functional.&#13;
13.2      To meet the increased need for various activities particularly to&#13;
make all hospitals in Bangladesh (about 700) "Baby Friendly" by the year 2000.&#13;
The facilities of the CPPBF secretariat will have to be expanded. This would&#13;
require:&#13;
(a)  a bigger office space with more physical facilities and appropriate&#13;
logistic support; and&#13;
(b)  increase in number of full time paid staff in the secretariat.&#13;
13.3      It is also proposed that to take the activities of CPPBF to the&#13;
district and sub-district levels decentralization of the CPPBF office is a&#13;
must in 5 divisions by establishing divisional centers. This is felt&#13;
necessary to (i) meet the increasing demand from the field; (ii) reduce load&#13;
on central CPPBF Secretariat; (iii) decentralization the supervision and&#13;
monitoring mechanism for BFHI and ending of free and low cost BMS; (iv) have&#13;
sustainability in the program and finally (v) to bring the whole country under&#13;
the Campaign net work.&#13;
14.       Project Activities: The following principal project activities will&#13;
be under taken in future to achieve the BF Goals in Bangladesh:&#13;
14.1      Updating the National Breastfeeding Policy for hospitals and&#13;
maternity facilities.&#13;
14.2      Continue the Advocacy and mobilization of key professionals&#13;
political will, professional allies, professional bodies, women's group, NGO's&#13;
GOB agencies/departments and donor agencies.&#13;
14.3      Institute of BFHI in hospitals providing maternity services.&#13;
14.4      Strict enforcement of the law prohibiting free and subsidized&#13;
supply of BMS in all Health facilities.&#13;
14.5      Comprehensive training for all health service providers.&#13;
14.6      Under taking relevant research.&#13;

1S.       Strategies&#13;
15.1      By the year 2000 we have to achieve Baby Friendly Hospital&#13;
initiative in all the health facilities providing maternity services. During&#13;
the period from 1995-2000 several activities and combination of various&#13;
strategies will be followed. They would be flexible enough to accommodate&#13;
required changes with regular review.&#13;
15.2      The following will be the strategy:&#13;
(a)  Creating, sustaining and supporting an effective national and sub-&#13;
national networks with GOB agencies, NGOs and other partners.&#13;
(b)  Creating, implementing and monitoring an appropriate legal&#13;
framework at all levels.&#13;
(c)  Integrating breastfeeding promotion and protection into health, FP&#13;
and other development activities of Government and NGOs programs.&#13;
(d)  Development of an effective service, research and training strategy&#13;
immediate importance to the campaign group, for the national and&#13;
directed towards achieving the goals.&#13;
(e)  Developing an effective communication strategy and promoting&#13;
community participation through advocacy, social mobilization and&#13;
program communication.&#13;
(f)  Ensuring successful breastfeeding for women in employment and&#13;
training.&#13;
(g)  Ensuring adequate child nutrition through successful infant feeding&#13;
practices.&#13;
Based on the above strategies appropriate and essential activities are&#13;
identified and an annual work plan is prepared by the members of the EC and&#13;
sub-committees in collaboration with the government counterparts and other NGO&#13;
partners.&#13;
16. Management of the Program: The management will continue to be done by&#13;
the members of the executive committee and subcommittees. Day to day&#13;
activities and implementation of various programs will be done by the Central&#13;
CPPBF Secretariat with its divisional branches.&#13;
16.1      At National level: The CPPBF Secretariat with the help of EC and&#13;
other subcommittees will continue to plan the formulation of policies,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
63&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 12 of 15&#13;
advocacy and lobbing at appropriate level. It will oversee the&#13;
implementation.&#13;
16.2      At divisional. District and below: Respective divisional chapters&#13;
of CPPBF and affiliated medical colleges/NGO/Institutions/Persons will&#13;
implement, manage and monitor all Breastfeeding activities. The Divisional&#13;
CPPBF secretariat will provide the secretarial support for implementation and&#13;
monitoring of all Breastfeeding activities.&#13;
16.3      The district level committees will also be formed to provide&#13;
Technical support, supervision and monitoring of activities at sub district&#13;
level.&#13;
17.       Monitoring and Review Mechanism: A high powered Advisory Committee&#13;
(comprising of 22 members) headed by the Additional Secretary of Ministry of&#13;
Health and Family Welfare has been created. An authorized person has been&#13;
appointed by the GOB to implement the code of marketing and to monitor any&#13;
violation of code and also to ensure monitoring ending distribution of free&#13;
and low cost breast milk substitute in health and maternity facilities.&#13;
Advisory Committee with the help of Code and Research Sub-committee of CPPBF&#13;
will establish an effective Surveillance System and Monitoring Mechanism at&#13;
national and sub national levels. The program will be evaluated by an&#13;
International agency at the end of Project period.&#13;
18.       Budget:&#13;

INTEGRATED NUTRITION PROJECT&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.        There are two kinds of monitoring under consideration within this&#13;
project subcomponent: a) Nutrition Monitoring; and b) project monitoring.The&#13;
former deals with measurements of nutritional status indicators and some&#13;
parameters relating to the causation of malnutrition. It would therefore be&#13;
largely carried out within CBNC. The latter concerns the regular assessment of&#13;
project progress in terms of inputs, process, outputs and outcomes.&#13;
2.        The community-based component of the project aims at strengthening&#13;
the people's own capacity to assess their nutrition problems, understand their&#13;
causes, develop locally resource-relevant actions which the community would&#13;
own and to monitor or re-assess the results of the actions taken. Such a&#13;
process is driven by the production, communication and use of information.&#13;
3.        Experience has shown that the early establishment of a community-&#13;
based monitoring system is of great importance for project mobilization. Such&#13;
a monitoring mechanism set close to the community will act as a stimulus and a&#13;
mobilizing force resulting in greater community participation in the project.&#13;
It will also ensure that interventions are more relevant because they take&#13;
account of local conditions and are understood by the people concerned.&#13;
Information Needs&#13;
4.        In the development of any information system it is important to&#13;
identify clearly the users of the information and their needs. Obviously the&#13;
main users should be those, whose decisions affect nutrition and could be&#13;
improved by more valid and timely information.&#13;
A. Household Level&#13;
5.        As far as the young child is concerned, the parents are the first&#13;
key decision-makers. Monitoring of the child's growth provides an excellent&#13;
tool in making the problem of malnutrition visible early enough for preventive&#13;
action to be taken. The actions that can be taken by the household must be&#13;
based on an analysis of the causes of growth faltering and an assessment of&#13;
resources available at the household level. This is the&#13;
prevention/counselling part of GMP. Many households will probably need&#13;
support from outside the household in preventing malnutrition both in terms of&#13;
additional resources and advice on how they could be best used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
68&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
B. Conmunity Level&#13;
6.        Eventually all community-based nutrition interventions will have to&#13;
be owned and driven by the communities themselves. This clearly requires some&#13;
sort of community organization which would be responsible for identifying,&#13;
assessing and addressing malnutrition within the community. Such community&#13;
organizations require an objective way of identifying the households most in&#13;
need. They require a monitoring system. Once again GMP would provide the&#13;
broad framework for such a system but the focus would be on the nutritional&#13;
status of the women and children of the community as a whole, identifying&#13;
actions to be taken at the community level in terms of using community&#13;
resources to help those who are in special need. Such decision should be&#13;
based on agreed criteria, such as 'lack of growth for two months' or 'severely&#13;
underweight' at any time. The community organization should monitor the&#13;
children selected for special treatment up to the point when their growth is&#13;
adequate. The overall nutrition situation in the community can be monitored&#13;
by the use of a community weight chart, where the weights of all children&#13;
weighed are plotted. Such an open and transparent system would help increase&#13;
the awareness of the community about the extent and nature of the problem and&#13;
catalyze a more active community involvement in its resolution.&#13;
C. Union/Thana Levels&#13;
7.        Program supervisors at Union and Thana levels also need information&#13;
about the nutritional status of the populations under their care and how it&#13;
changes over time. Depending on the actual coverage of the GMP program,&#13;
different approaches should be used. If the GMP program covers 80 percent or&#13;
more of the children, data at village level can be aggregated and sent to the&#13;
Union and Thana levels. If, however, the GMP-program does not cover 80&#13;
percent of the eligible children, a sentinel approach should be used. A&#13;
sentinel system consists of a limited number of carefully selected&#13;
villages/communities, which would provide information to higher levels on a&#13;
pre-determined regular basis.&#13;
Indicators&#13;
8.        CBNC of this project will focus on young children, pregnant and&#13;
lactating women. Weight for age will be used to monitor the nutritional&#13;
status of young children, weight for height or arm circumference for pregnant&#13;
and lactating women. Weight gain during pregnancy will also be measured.&#13;
9.        Monitoring the nutritional status will show whether the problem is&#13;
getting worse or better, but it will not show why there are changes. In order&#13;
to be able to provide the right response, information is required not only&#13;
about the nutritional outcome, but also about the reasons for it. Thus there&#13;
is a need for nutrition problem monitoring in addition to nutrition status&#13;
monitoring.&#13;
10.       Household food security, access to basic health services and a&#13;
healthy environment and adequate care of children and women are the three&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
69&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 3 of 9&#13;
necessary conditions for nutritional well being. In order to understand which&#13;
of these conditions are not being fulfilled in a given situation, indicators&#13;
must be found to measure each of them. Some of these indicators need to be&#13;
defined as appropriate for local context. Some examples of generic indicators&#13;
are listed below:&#13;
Household food security      * per capita calorie consumption&#13;
*  price of staple foods&#13;
*  actual harvest data (food balance&#13;
sheets)&#13;
*  weight for height of adult men&#13;
* presence or absence of kitchen gardens&#13;
Caring practices             +  prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding&#13;
of children below 4 months of age&#13;
* prevalence of sustained breastfeeding&#13;
at 1 year of age&#13;
?  feeding frequency&#13;
*  energy density of complementary diet&#13;
*  ratio of food consumption by women&#13;
compared to men.&#13;
*  practice of decreasing or increasing&#13;
food consumption by pregnant women.&#13;
Health Service/Environment  *  immunization coverage (measles)&#13;
+  incidence of diarrhoea (in particular&#13;
persistent diarrhoea)&#13;
*  use of safe drinking water&#13;
*  form of excreta disposal&#13;
11.       If possible, a few resource indicators should also be obtained,&#13;
such as access to land or to other means of production, income, size of&#13;
family, and some other local-specific socio-economic indicators.&#13;
Proiect Monitoring&#13;
12.       The project will establish a project management information system&#13;
for monitoring of project inputs, process outputs, service coverage and&#13;
outcomes. The Union Local Government will be the focal point for all project&#13;
monitoring. A quarterly report based on predetermined indicators will be&#13;
prepared for the central project unit (at the national level), with one copy&#13;
to the Thana coordinator and one copy to the District coordinator. But&#13;
primarily, the monitoring will be done by the Union level worker/volunteer.&#13;
The information system will be simple, rational and need-based. The format&#13;
will be uniform and the whole system will be geared towards the least common&#13;
denominator, i.e. with the minimum strain on the workload at the grass-root&#13;
level. A two-way feedback system will ensure that the results of any analysis&#13;
performed at the central level would be shared with the grass-root level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 6&#13;
Page 4 of 9&#13;
Evaluations&#13;
13.       The whole project will be evaluated after two years of&#13;
implementation and at the end of the project (after five years). Each&#13;
evaluation will consist of two parts. The first part will consist of an&#13;
internal evaluation, wherein all key actors get involved in reviewing progress&#13;
at village, union, thana and district levels. Information on process outputs&#13;
and outcomes will be available through the monitoring system at each level.&#13;
Some additional studies would be commissioned to provide a more detailed&#13;
understanding of the impact of the project on nutritional status.&#13;
14.       The second part will consist of an external evaluation, which will&#13;
follow the normal procedures of the World Bank. Both success factors and&#13;
constraints should be carefully analyzed in order to facilitate necessary and&#13;
possible mid-term re-orientation of the Project.&#13;
15.       Both parts of the evaluation will be based on the specific&#13;
objectives of the project as stated at the outset, measuring performance&#13;
against the baseline situation as indicated by appropriate parameters.&#13;

BANGLADESH&#13;
INTEGRATED NUTRITION PROJECT&#13;
Community-Based Nutrition Component (CBNC)&#13;
Obiectives and Rationale&#13;
A. Obiectives&#13;
1.        The overall goal of the community-based nutrition component (CBNC)&#13;
would be to strengthen communities' capacity to assess their malnutrition&#13;
problems, analyze their causes, and make better use of family, community and&#13;
outside resources to improve their nutritional status. Its specific&#13;
objectives would be to:&#13;
* develop community and family capacity to monitor nutritional&#13;
status;&#13;
* develop community and family capacity to care for vulnerable&#13;
members, especially pregnant and lactating women and very young&#13;
children;&#13;
* strengthen the outreach and quality of MCH interventions and&#13;
develop community and government capacity to target them on the&#13;
nutritionally most vulnerable; and&#13;
* develop community and government capacity to harness the&#13;
resources of local development programs aimed at increasing&#13;
income, food security and access to clean water, and target them&#13;
on the nutritionally most vulnerable.&#13;
2.        The community-based nutrition component would involve community&#13;
workers, community groups, local governments and NGOs in achieving the above&#13;
objectives.&#13;
B. Rationale&#13;
3.        This component is seen as the core of the proposed project, for the&#13;
following reasons.&#13;
(a) First, malnutrition in Bangladesh is not a problem confined to the&#13;
very poor. It exists to a significant extent even among groups&#13;
with enough resources to feed their families adequately. This&#13;
strongly suggests that increased incomes and hence greater&#13;
household food security, among the very poor will not necessarily&#13;
lead to corresponding gains in nutritional status unless&#13;
accompanied by education which results in changing the way families&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 2 of 16&#13;
feed women and children, and care for their health. Community&#13;
education is therefore a fundamental intervention, without which&#13;
other interventions will have little impact.&#13;
(b) Second, there is evidence from the distribution of malnutrition in&#13;
Bangladesh that behavioral change can have a substantial impact on&#13;
nutrition even in the absence of increased incomes and greater food&#13;
availability to the household. High overall rates of malnutrition&#13;
tend to hide the fact that wasting, signalling current acute&#13;
malnutrition, is heavily concentrated in children under two years;&#13;
malnutrition in older children and adults consists mostly of&#13;
stunting, the product of previous episodes of wasting. The fact&#13;
that wasting falls sharply at age four and five, ages when children&#13;
are more expensive to feed, suggests that the cause of malnutrition&#13;
is not just inability to afford food.&#13;
4.        Malnutrition is in large part the effect of beliefs and customs&#13;
which result in very young children not being fed enough, as well as not&#13;
receiving adequate health care. When children are old enough to feed&#13;
themselves, as opposed to being dependent on being fed by their mothers, their&#13;
nutrition improves. The same cultural forces also affect the nutrition of&#13;
women, who in Bangladesh eat only after the rest of the family is satisfied,&#13;
and therefore tend to eat least. Pregnant and lactating women, like very&#13;
young children, have their dietary intakes controlled by custom, and cannot&#13;
easily increase them to meet their increased physiological needs.&#13;
5.        One reason that families fail to care adequately for pregnant women&#13;
and young children is that they do not realize they are malnourished.&#13;
Creating a community capacity to recognize and monitor malnutrition is&#13;
therefore a key project strategy, as is education to change customary feeding&#13;
and health care habits. Since families, feeding and health care practices are&#13;
deeply ingrained in cultural tradition, they are not easy to change; IEC based&#13;
on mass media alone is not likely to generate an appropriate response.&#13;
Husbands need to be shown that their wives are malnourished, and parents that&#13;
their children are malnourished, and then be counselled appropriately. This&#13;
can be best achieved by a face-to-face approach in the community, through the&#13;
culturally acceptable medium of a trained community worker volunteer,&#13;
reinforced by group support from the community. It is for this reason that a&#13;
community-based approach is proposed for this core component of the project.&#13;
6.        Notwithstanding the importance of behavioral change in reducing&#13;
malnutrition, many malnourished families in Bangladesh need better access to&#13;
food, safe water and health services. The project's intersectoral component&#13;
describes the key inputs required in these areas and the funding mechanisms&#13;
proposed for them under the project. But most poor families have neither the&#13;
knowledge nor the power to access such inputs and services on their own. CBNC&#13;
would therefore build village and slum communities' capacity to work with&#13;
local governments and NGOs to harness resources from locally operating&#13;
projects and programs in these areas, and target them at the nutritionally&#13;
most vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 3 of 16&#13;
Interventions&#13;
7.        The following specific interventions would be supported under this&#13;
component to deal, respectively, with micro-nutrient deficiencies and protein-&#13;
energy malnutrition.&#13;
A. Micro-nutrient deficiencies&#13;
8.        There is a separate project component to strengthen existing&#13;
national efforts to correct three key vitamin and mineral deficiencies i.e.,&#13;
of vitamin A, iron and iodine. CBNC would link these efforts to other&#13;
interventions within its operational thanas.&#13;
9.        Nutrition education would be given to encourage consumption of&#13;
foods rich in iron and vitamin A and avoidance of goitrogenic foods. Further&#13;
details are given in the IEC component. Also, extension efforts encouraging&#13;
homestead food production (kitchen gardens and poultry farming) under the&#13;
intersectoral nutrition component would promote the growing of such foods&#13;
within the household ensuring easy access and affordability.&#13;
10.       Since dietary behavioral change is difficult and probably a long-&#13;
term proposition, IEC efforts would also promote the acceptance of vitamin A&#13;
supplements in capsule form for children under six; iron supplements in tablet&#13;
form for pregnant and lactating women; and iodine capsules for women of&#13;
reproductive age. As for micronutrient supplementation per se, since the&#13;
national requirement is already partly included in other projects, this&#13;
project would finance the remainder through the component dealing with it.&#13;
B. Protein-Enercy Malnutrition&#13;
11.       The component would support the following interventions to prevent&#13;
and treat PEM.&#13;
(a) Screenincr. education and supplementary feeding of pregnant and&#13;
lactating women&#13;
(i) This will be first attempted on an experimental basis in three&#13;
of the six first year thanas. An assessment of costs and&#13;
benefits will be made at the end of two years, the findings of&#13;
which will determine whether supplementary feeding of PLW&#13;
should be extended to all the project thanas.&#13;
(ii) Pregnant women would be registered by the end of the first&#13;
trimester, and screened for malnutrition. All pregnant and&#13;
lactating women would receive education on the quantity and&#13;
quality of their diet, and the need to rest more during&#13;
pregnancy. Pregnant women identified as being at risk of&#13;
having a low birth weight baby (approximately 601) would&#13;
receive a daily supplement yielding about 600 calories from the&#13;
time of screening through the sixth month of lactation. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
79&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 4 of 16&#13;
most appropriate methodology for workers to measure pregnant&#13;
women's nutritional risk under field conditions needs to be&#13;
worked out yet.&#13;
(b) Adolescent Qirls.&#13;
(i)  A strong technical case can be made for screening and&#13;
supplementing malnourished adolescent girls for about a year at&#13;
the onset of puberty. The adolescent growth spurt presents the&#13;
first (and last) biologically effective opportunity to&#13;
counteract childhood stunting once the child is past the age of&#13;
three. Food supplementation to a girl at this age while bones&#13;
are being formed is the last opportunity to ensure that her&#13;
pelvis will be big enough for easy child-birth. Moreover,&#13;
improving the nutrition of adolescent girls helps to ensure&#13;
that newly weds enter their first pregnancy with adequate body&#13;
stores. Such a strategy is likely to reduce the proportion of&#13;
pregnant women who would need supplementation and therefore&#13;
tantamounts to a preventive approach applied earlier on.&#13;
Missing the opportunity to correct undernutrition at the&#13;
adolescent age and consequently delaying supplementation of&#13;
malnourished women until the second trimester of pregnancy is&#13;
only a second-best solution. It may be too late for them to put&#13;
on the weight they need to avoid low birth weight babies and&#13;
progressive maternal depletion.&#13;
(ii)  However, nutritional intervention at menarche is a relatively&#13;
new concept. Its cost-effectiveness is unclear, and in&#13;
particular it is of unknown cultural acceptability in&#13;
Bangladesh. Operations research will therefore be carried out&#13;
on the cultural, operational and financial feasibility of this&#13;
intervention as part of the program development component which&#13;
provides for such research.&#13;
(c) Growth MonitorinQ and Promotion (GMP) - Children under 2 years of&#13;
aqe&#13;
(i)  Children belonging to target households (the proposed target&#13;
groups are defined in the subsequent section) would be weighed&#13;
monthly from birth to the age of 24 months. Growth monitoring&#13;
would have three main purposes: first, to demonstrate to&#13;
parents their child's nutrition status and its growth pattern;&#13;
second, to help determine the type of follow-on interventions&#13;
in the areas of caring practices, health and food security; and&#13;
third, to demonstrate to parents the response of the child's&#13;
growth path to these interventions. Growth monitoring would&#13;
therefore be the core intervention, since it would motivate and&#13;
initiate family, community and government action, and monitor&#13;
the results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
80&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 5 of 16&#13;
(ii) Because a) the bulk of wasting is concentrated in the first two&#13;
years, b) malnutrition after two years is harder to correct,&#13;
and c) weighing and charting is time-consuming for workers,&#13;
growth monitoring would be confined to the 0-24 month group.&#13;
Thereafter, severely malnourished children needing immediate&#13;
supplementation, if brought to the attention of the CNP, would&#13;
be referred to the health service facility.&#13;
(iii) The growth chart currently being used in Bangladesh is not&#13;
suitable for the above purposes, since it does not distinguish&#13;
between the different grades of nutrition status. It will&#13;
therefore be replaced by a more suitable card; a likely&#13;
candidate is the UNICEF rainbow/bubble chart, which is easy&#13;
both for mothers to interpret and workers to fill in. This&#13;
card is already being field tested in Bangladesh.&#13;
(d) Identification and sDecial care of low birth weight (LBW) babies&#13;
(i) Babies would be weighed as soon as possible after birth.&#13;
Mothers of LBW babies would receive special education on the&#13;
care and feeding of new born. Special attention will also be&#13;
given to the mother's needs during lactation.&#13;
(e) Education on breast-feeding and weaning&#13;
(i) Mothers would receive education on the use of colostrum and&#13;
exclusive breast-feeding during the first six months, and&#13;
continuation of breast-feeding until the age of two. Parents&#13;
and mothers-in-law would be educated on the need to introduce&#13;
solid foods in sufficient quantity and quality from the age of&#13;
six months.&#13;
(f) Health education&#13;
(i) Health education would be given to all families in contact with&#13;
the program on four main contributors to malnutrition: a) the&#13;
immunizable diseases (need for immunization); b) diarrhea&#13;
(hygiene education and home fluid rehydration); c) ARIs (home&#13;
care of mild and moderate cases and referral of the severe&#13;
ones); and d) maternal depletion (need for birth spacing).&#13;
(g) Health check-up and referral&#13;
(i) Children suspected of having health problems would be referred&#13;
to the Family Welfare visitor (FWv) or the Medical Assistant&#13;
for diagnosis and treatment, or further referral. All children&#13;
of third degree malnutrition and all children failing to gain&#13;
weight while in the supplementation program would automatically&#13;
be referred.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
81&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 6 of 16&#13;
(h)  Deworminc&#13;
(i) Parasites contribute to malnutrition by absorbing nutrients.&#13;
However, recent research in many parts of the world shows that&#13;
deworming is not cost-effective in pre-school children, since&#13;
at that age wormloads have not built up to levels that make a&#13;
real difference to nutrition. A study being financed under the&#13;
Fourth Population and Health Project will, inter alia, help&#13;
determine the intensity of infestation at different ages and in&#13;
different parts of Bangladesh. Based on the findings, a&#13;
decision will be taken whether deworming will be a universal or&#13;
a targeted intervention for children under the project, and the&#13;
appropriate drugs for prophylaxis. Such an intervention might&#13;
prove to be particularly useful for school-age children.&#13;
(i)  Supplementary Feeding of Children&#13;
(i) The purpose of supplementation would be to demonstrate to&#13;
parents through growth charts the substantial and rapid gains&#13;
in nutrition status that are possible through feeding small&#13;
additional quantities of food, providing the child is otherwise&#13;
healthy and without heavy parasite infestation. The limited&#13;
duration of supplementation would avoid dependence on the&#13;
program, and emphasize to parents their primary responsibility&#13;
for feeding the child. The intention of such supplementary&#13;
feeding is not to deal with the food security problems of the&#13;
poorest families, which would be addressed through harnessing&#13;
the resources of income generation programs to help food-&#13;
insecure families.&#13;
(ii) Target group children under the age of two with faltering&#13;
growth and/or children of grade II malnutrition would receive a&#13;
special food supplement yielding approximately 350 calories per&#13;
ration, six days a week for a period of three months, or until&#13;
they recovered to a normal growth path whichever is longer in&#13;
duration.   Children with a severe degree of malnutrition&#13;
(grade III) would receive twice the daily ration and for a&#13;
period of four months, with the same exit criteria. The&#13;
supplement for children would be fed on the spot at a&#13;
supervised feeding center within the community, to ensure that&#13;
they received the full benefit of the supplement.&#13;
(iii) Operations research will be carried out to determine an&#13;
appropriate supplementary food. The criteria will be&#13;
palatability (including potential for preparation in different&#13;
ways); nutrient content and density; reliance on locally&#13;
available ingredients and preparation methods; shelf-life; and&#13;
cost (including preparation costs). The potential of amylase&#13;
enrichment, with which ICDDR'B is experimenting, will also be&#13;
examined, especially with regard to increasing the volume of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 7 of 16&#13;
food which can be absorbed by third degree children who may&#13;
need the planned double ration but at the same time be&#13;
anorexic. Possibilities of fortifying the supplementary food&#13;
with iron and other micronutrients will also be piloted and&#13;
expanded to project areas if found feasible.&#13;
(j) Food security, water supply and health care interventions&#13;
Specific interventions in these areas would be financed under the&#13;
project's inter-sectoral nutrition component. The related intervention under&#13;
CBNC would be to strengthen communities' capacity to harness resources in&#13;
these areas and target them on those most in need.&#13;
Geographic Phasing and site selection&#13;
12.       National coverage of this component would not be attempted during&#13;
the six year life of the proposed project, both because of limited managerial&#13;
capacity and because of the need to determine the approach(es) for wider&#13;
application by learning from earlier experiences. Given the differences in&#13;
health service capacity as well as the social milieu between rural areas and&#13;
urban slums, it is envisaged that implementation arrangements would be&#13;
introduced in about two or three sites (both rural thanas and urban slums)&#13;
during the first year of the project, about 11 more sites will be added in&#13;
each of the second and third years and then, subject to the mid-term review,&#13;
CBNC will be further expanded to cover about 50 sites. The total population&#13;
in the proposed project area would be about 13 million by the end of the&#13;
project period. Based on the evaluation results, follow-on project(s) would&#13;
expand the coverage eventually nation-wide. The geographic areas to be&#13;
targeted will be selected using the criteria outline in annex 13.&#13;
Target Groups&#13;
13.       Targeting is more of an issue for PEM than for micronutrient&#13;
interventions because of the former's greater managerial complexity and&#13;
relatively high cost (especially for GMP). Special care will therefore be&#13;
needed to target the project resources for PEM interventions at the clients&#13;
where they are likely to yield maximal results as well as where the need is&#13;
most. Two client targeting strategies are currently proposed. These&#13;
alternative strategies would be tested in some Thanas during the first three&#13;
years of the project. A decision would then be taken on the strategy to be&#13;
adopted on a large scale, based on a mid-term evaluation.&#13;
A. All Vulnerable women and children&#13;
14.       Under this strategy, the above interventions would be targeted on&#13;
all pregnant and lactating women and all children 0-36 months in the project&#13;
area; and, depending on the results of operations research, on all adolescent&#13;
girls around menarche. These are the groups in society most vulnerable to&#13;
malnutrition. They are also the groups where intervention can have the&#13;
greatest effect in preventing malnutrition. The strategy of targeting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
83&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 8 of 16&#13;
resources on pregnant and lactating women and the youngest children is much&#13;
more cost-effective than trying to treat malnutrition among older children.&#13;
The focus of the proposed strategy on prevention rather than cure is in line&#13;
with the national primary health care policy.&#13;
15.       If this strategy could be successfully managed, targeting the&#13;
entire nutritionally vulnerable group on the above lines would be the quickest&#13;
way to make an impact on malnutrition in Bangladesh. It would signal a major&#13;
commitment to tackling the problem, on a scale already made by several other&#13;
Asian countries. If the strategy were implemented on a national scale it&#13;
would imply substantial annual recurrent costs but the long-term cost would be&#13;
far less. It is expected to be more affordable and certainly more beneficial,&#13;
for example, than the recently discontinued Rural Ration Scheme.&#13;
16.       A more significant issue than incremental cost is the managerial&#13;
challenge of implementing a program targeting the entire vulnerable group,&#13;
given the very limited existing institutional infrastructure for community&#13;
nutrition. For this reason, consideration is also being given to a second&#13;
targeting strategy focusing on a subset of the nutritionally vulnerable group.&#13;
B. Newly married women, their children, and all severely malnourished children&#13;
17.       This strategy will be introduced in one thana as a pilot test as it&#13;
has not been tried out before. Its costs and benefits will be analyzed at the&#13;
end of the project for possible expansion in the future project(s).&#13;
18.       Under this strategy, specific interventions would be focussed on&#13;
each newly married woman and her family from the time of marriage through the&#13;
first two years after the birth of her first child; and on any severely&#13;
malnourished child discovered through a scheme of regular "arm-banding" of the&#13;
0-24 months age group (arm-banding is used since it is an easier technique&#13;
than the weighing used in the strategy outlined in para 4.1 above and the idea&#13;
of this targeting strategy is to reduce the labor-intensiveness of the other&#13;
strategy). The rationale for including the severely malnourished is that&#13;
their risk of death is several times that of normal children; it would&#13;
therefore be unacceptable not to intervene to help this group. The rationale&#13;
for choosing the newly married for special attention would be three-fold:&#13;
*   given the young age at marriage and limited education of young&#13;
women in Bangladesh, the first pregnancy is the riskiest for&#13;
both mother and child. Focusing care on the woman at this stage&#13;
in her life would be targeting the most vulnerable stage of the&#13;
reproductive cycle&#13;
*   women who are already suffering from maternal depletion and who&#13;
have had several malnourished children have formed bad self-care&#13;
and child-care habits which are hard to correct. The newly&#13;
married couple is more likely to respond positively to well-&#13;
planned counselling and encouragement from the community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Moreover, good care habits formed at the start of marriage are&#13;
likely to carry over into good care for subsequent children&#13;
*   If this strategy is applied with some careful thought, the&#13;
benefits could be more than nutritional. For example, the&#13;
package of services provided might serve as an incentive to&#13;
delay the first child birth since the couple would remain in the&#13;
program until the first baby is two years old.&#13;
*   the newly married couples are seen by the community as being at&#13;
the start of their lives. The idea of helping them can be&#13;
expected to get a strong acceptance by the community; this has&#13;
been substantiated by empirical evidence obtained through&#13;
informal discussions with Bangladeshi communities.&#13;
19.       This innovative targeting strategy would substantially reduce the&#13;
number of project clients. Under the 'entire vulnerable group' strategy, the&#13;
clients would number about 30 pregnant/lactating women and about 90 children&#13;
in the age group of 0-36 month in an average village of a thousand population.&#13;
Under the 'newly married' strategy, the clients would number about 12 newly&#13;
married women, about 12 of their children, and about 15 severely malnourished.&#13;
Although all mothers and children in this group would have access to the&#13;
special package of education and health care interventions, only women&#13;
pregnant for the first time and their first children would be eligible for&#13;
food supplementation.&#13;
20.       This reduction in the size of the target group would have the&#13;
primary advantage of increasing the quality of interventions by focussing on a&#13;
more manageable number of clients. Since large scale community nutrition&#13;
interventions are new to Bangladesh, it is possible that intense attention to&#13;
a small number of priority clients could be a more effective approach than&#13;
attempting to reach all the vulnerable women and children, and running the&#13;
risk of low service quality because of the diffusion of effort.&#13;
21.       The cost implications of the different targeting strategies are&#13;
secondary, given that both are cheaper than the broad-based ration and food&#13;
subsidy schemes already tried in Bangladesh. Nevertheless, targeting project&#13;
interventions on this subset of the nutritionally vulnerable group would be&#13;
substantially cheaper than targeting the entire group (although its impact on&#13;
malnutrition has not yet been tested). Cost savings would be limited for&#13;
staff, because of the significant 'fixed cost' of staffing an effective&#13;
community-based intervention, but substantial in terms of supplementary food.&#13;
Implementation: Community-Based Structure And Processes&#13;
22.       The component would put in place a structure at the village level&#13;
capable of providing the above interventions to the chosen target group; and a&#13;
process which would develop communities' capacity to assess their nutrition&#13;
problem and its causes, participate in planning and implementing solutions,&#13;
and help monitor project performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
85&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 10 of 16&#13;
A. Structure&#13;
23.       At the village level, the key structures for implementing the&#13;
project would be a part-time community nutrition promoter (CNP) in each&#13;
village, and a women's group interested in health and nutrition, working with&#13;
the existing village power structure of elders and other influential persons,&#13;
and the Village Development Committee (VDC)&#13;
Community Nutrition Promoters&#13;
24.       The workload involved in implementing the above interventions is&#13;
substantial. For example, growth monitoring, counselling and micro-nutrient&#13;
distribution sessions would take one worker the equivalent of about three days&#13;
a month for the 'vulnerable group' strategy, and training, record-keeping and&#13;
reporting would require another two days. Home visits to families needing&#13;
special attention would need about an hour a day, and supplementary feeding&#13;
would take two workers about two hours each per day, six days a week. This&#13;
total workload would average out to about four hours a day for the main&#13;
worker, plus two hours a day for the secondary worker.&#13;
25.       Growth monitoring and related activities would take about one and a&#13;
half days a month as would training, record-keeping and reporting. Home&#13;
visits would still require an hour a day, because of the large number of grade&#13;
three children to be followed up, and supplementary feeding would take about&#13;
an hour and a half a day for one worker. This would average out to about&#13;
three hours a day.&#13;
26.       In view of their current duties being already heavy the existing&#13;
health FP workers cannot be expected to take on the additional workload.&#13;
Volunteers are unlikely to work for more than three or four hours a week,&#13;
implying the need for at least six volunteers per village. The cost of the&#13;
large supervisory cadre which would be required to provide this number of&#13;
volunteers with adequate supervision and support would exceed the financial&#13;
savings of using volunteers in the first place. Moreover volunteers would&#13;
probably be less amenable to project control and accountability and this might&#13;
risk inconsistencies in the quality and reliability of the crucial&#13;
interventions. However, it is recognized that the creation of a new permanent&#13;
cadre of single-purpose workers is not a sustainable on desirable option.&#13;
27.       It is therefore proposed that the key village level worker would be&#13;
a Community Nutrition Promoter (CNP), paid a compensation of about Tk.500 a&#13;
month. An additional amount of Tk. 300 a month would be provided to cover&#13;
incidental costs involved in running a community nutrition center on a daily&#13;
basis. Evidence from previously tried similar community based efforts&#13;
suggests that honoraria of this size are an adequate incentive for good&#13;
performance.  Remuneration at this level would ensure that the human resources&#13;
costs of the program remain affordable and more importantly, the worker would&#13;
not be perceived as a salaried government employee, but rather as a part of&#13;
the community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
86&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 11 of 16&#13;
28.       CNPs would be women with children, living in the local community,&#13;
to ensure easy access and social acceptability to their clients. They would&#13;
have a minimum education of 8th class or equivalent, to ensure sufficient&#13;
literacy for growth monitoring and reporting. They should preferably be women&#13;
from the poorer section of the community who have at least one well-nourished&#13;
child; such women, even before training, would possess maternal and child care&#13;
skills which they could pass on to others in the community. Detailed&#13;
selection criteria for CNPs are given in annex 14.&#13;
29.       Experience from other similar projects suggests that one CNP would&#13;
be needed to cover a population of 1,000 adequately for purposes of tasks&#13;
envisaged under CBNC. However, to assess the necessary CNP/population ratio&#13;
in Bangladesh, this project will test two ratios - 1 per 1,000 and 1 per&#13;
1,500, in the three thanas each, in the first two years. A review of the&#13;
experience in these six thanas will determine the appropriate ratio to be used&#13;
in the subsequent thanas.&#13;
30.       The activities of CNPs would provide a unique opportunity for the&#13;
women to interact on other social issues at the village level. This could&#13;
bring about a synergy between the various activities impinging on the well-&#13;
being of families, using nutrition as a thematic center of community welfare&#13;
in its broad sense.&#13;
Communitv groups&#13;
31.       In some slums and villages, women's groups have already been formed&#13;
for health and nutrition purposes, often by NGOs. These would be made use of&#13;
to assist in project implementation as outlined below. Wherever women's&#13;
groups have been formed for other purposes, for example income generation&#13;
schemes, these would be examined to see whether they consist of women&#13;
interested in health and nutrition improvement, and whether they are suitable&#13;
for involvement in this project activity.&#13;
32.       Where such groups do not exist, groups of ten to twenty women would&#13;
be chosen for their interest in health and nutrition, their willingness to&#13;
spend a few hours a week helping the program, and for their representation of&#13;
different social and geographic sections of the community. The groups would&#13;
normally include the local VDPs and TBAs. They would be trained and used to:&#13;
a) explain the program's goals and services to the community; b) assist in&#13;
the process of assessment, analysis and action described below; c) encourage&#13;
women to participate in project services; and d) assist in health and&#13;
nutrition education.&#13;
B. Proceoses&#13;
Introduction of services: the community contract&#13;
33.       At the beginning of the program, the women's group would be formed&#13;
before service delivery is started, and its members, the VDC, the village&#13;
elders and other influential and interested local people would be informed of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
87&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 12 of 16&#13;
the services to be provided. The participants in this initial mobilization&#13;
process would be informed that the program services were their right. They&#13;
would be advised to get in touch with Union Parishad officials or the&#13;
program's technical supervisors to complain if they did not receive program&#13;
services as planned.&#13;
34.       These community representatives would be clearly explained what&#13;
their major roles would be: a) work with program supervisors to choose a&#13;
Community Nutrition Worker; b) participate in the process of assessing,&#13;
analyzing and acting to improve their community's nutrition status; c)&#13;
provide a place (such as a school or other public building or a house) where&#13;
supplementation would be provided, and records could be kept; and d) help&#13;
monitor the program's performance in a way that is transparent to the&#13;
community. Participation in the program would therefore imply a contract in&#13;
which, the community would be entitled to certain rights in return for&#13;
assuming certain responsibilities.&#13;
Community assessment, analysis and action&#13;
35.       The community, especially the proposed VDC, the village elders, the&#13;
women's group, the school-teacher and the mothers participating directly in&#13;
the program, would be involved in the following specific ways in assessing the&#13;
local nutrition situation, discussing its causes and deciding what to do about&#13;
it.&#13;
36.       At the beginning of the program in any village or slum, a census&#13;
and nutritional screening of all project beneficiaries would be undertaken,&#13;
and the results permanently displayed on a combined Community Growth Chart at&#13;
the food supplementation (community feeding) center. Thus each interested&#13;
community member would be aware of the nutrition problem to be dealt with in&#13;
the area.&#13;
37.       This community growth chart would be used to raise the community's&#13;
awareness of the nutrition situation and generate discussion of its causes and&#13;
hence of approaches to dealing with it. Program supervisors would work with&#13;
the community to explain that changes in health and nutrition practices in the&#13;
families are as critical to addressing malnutrition as improvements in food&#13;
availability, health services, water supply and sanitation. While the&#13;
community might need help from the outside for the latter group of actions,&#13;
support of community groups is particularly valuable and essential for the&#13;
former.&#13;
38.       The community and program supervisors would work together to draw&#13;
up a plan of action to reduce malnutrition in the community. This plan would&#13;
be on two levels: a) efforts which could be undertaken with the village's own&#13;
resources, such as providing local employment for a destitute family; and b)&#13;
those which would require outside assistance, such as the allocation of Public&#13;
Food Distribution System assistance to needy families, or the provision of a&#13;
tube-well to the village.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
88&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 13 of 16&#13;
39.       This plan of action would then be reviewed at a joint meeting at&#13;
the Union level between representatives of the VDC, program supervisors and&#13;
Union Parishad leaders. Union Parishad officials working with program&#13;
supervisors would then decide on the relative priority of different requests&#13;
for support, and would approach government departments and NGOs working in the&#13;
area to seek their support in targeting services on priority local needs.&#13;
Besides being the main elements of CBNC, this community-driven mechanism is&#13;
envisaged to be central to how the intersectoral component would be&#13;
operationalized at the grass-roots level.&#13;
Community monitoring&#13;
40.       The community growth chart would be updated each quarter, and this&#13;
event would be used as an opportunity for a performance review of project&#13;
services and other nutrition-related programs, by VDCs, the women's groups,&#13;
the Union Parishad and program supervisors.&#13;
41.       In addition, the women's group and mothers benefiting from&#13;
supplementation would have a specific role in monitoring the delivery and use&#13;
of food supplements. They would be made aware of the amounts of food which&#13;
should be delivered to the village each month, and a women's group member&#13;
would attend the supplementation session each day both to assist the worker&#13;
and to see that target clients receive their entitlement. The experience of&#13;
the Vulnerable Group Development Program suggests that preventing food&#13;
leakages is vital and beneficiary monitoring might be the best way to&#13;
accomplish that.&#13;
NGO Participation&#13;
42.       Where suitable NGOs are active in areas related to nutrition or in&#13;
case an NGO is interested in participating in the project in a new thana,&#13;
their involvement in the project, especially for community mobilization would&#13;
be encouraged. NGO participation will be of two types: (a) in some thanas,&#13;
the chosen NGO will be given the full responsibility of project&#13;
implementation, under contract with GOB; (b) in the other thanas, the NGO will&#13;
provide key areas of support, viz., community mobilization, training and&#13;
supervision and the logistics of preparation, packaging and delivery of&#13;
supplementary food. In the former case, the CNPs and CNOs and other project&#13;
personnel will belong to the NGO concerned; GOB health facilities will be used&#13;
for referral of cases. The concerned NGO will submit project monitoring&#13;
reports to GOB in respect of the given thanas.&#13;
43.       A draft contract specifying clearly the terms and conditions for&#13;
NGO participation (in each of the above models) has been prepared.&#13;
44.       The budget will be the same for INGO-run GOB-supported" thanas as&#13;
for the "GOB-run NGO-supported" thanas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
89&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 14 of 16&#13;
Implementation: Proqram Supervision And Support&#13;
45.       Experience in other countries has shown that community-based&#13;
nutrition interventions are only effective if community workers and groups are&#13;
supported by strong technical supervision and training. A second lesson from&#13;
international experience has been that field-based training for community&#13;
workers is more effective as well as cheaper than institution-based training.&#13;
A third has been that one of the best forms of in-service training is&#13;
supportive supervision, and vice versa. Therefore, under the project it is&#13;
proposed to combine technical supervision and training, both at the Union and&#13;
at the Thana level.&#13;
(a) The Union Level&#13;
(i) International experience with community-based nutrition&#13;
programs indicates that quality supervision and in-service&#13;
training require at least one supervisor for every 10-12&#13;
workers. This would imply a need for two supervisory personnel&#13;
at the Union level to support an average of 20 CNPs. Part of&#13;
this supervisory role could be played by the two Family Welfare&#13;
Visitors (FWVs) at the Union level, one of whom is already in&#13;
place, the second being expected to be posted by MOHFW.&#13;
However, the two FWVs could not take on the full load of&#13;
nutrition supervision without adversely affecting the&#13;
effectiveness of their other family planning and MCH&#13;
responsibilities. It is therefore proposed to hire one&#13;
additional female worker at the Union level dedicated to the&#13;
nutrition program.&#13;
(ii) This full-time worker, who would be called the Community&#13;
Nutrition Organizer (CNO) would have the following duties:&#13;
*  at project initiation, to work with village communities to form&#13;
women's groups and catalyze the process of assessment, analysis&#13;
and action described a fore; and&#13;
*  to work with VDCs, women's groups and Union Parishads to define&#13;
which villages and families would benefit from targeted support&#13;
from intersectoral programs affecting nutrition, and monitor&#13;
their performance on a quarterly basis.&#13;
(iii) The CNO and FWVs would share the responsibility for day to day&#13;
technical supervision. The CNO would take primary&#13;
responsibility for the quality of the CNPs' community&#13;
mobilization role; the FWVs, would supervise ten CNPs each, in&#13;
an average Union, focusing on linkages with the health and FP&#13;
service. Each of the three Union level supervisors would pay&#13;
particular attention to the coverage of pregnant and lactating&#13;
women and children by GMP; to the quality of weighing, charting&#13;
and health and nutrition education; and to the targeting of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
90&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 15 of 16&#13;
health services on needy clients, including the organization of&#13;
referrals to the THC as appropriate.&#13;
(iv) The CNO and FWVs would provide on the job training to the CNPs&#13;
during their supervisory rounds as required. Once a month, the&#13;
CNO and the Fwv would assemble the CNPs for a half day session&#13;
with the objectives of performance review; problem-solving; and&#13;
providing training on specific areas of deficiencies found&#13;
during supervision visits.&#13;
(b)   The Thana Level&#13;
(i) The program would require both administrative and technical&#13;
support from the Thana level. The Thana Nirvahi Officer (TNO)&#13;
would chair the Thana Nutrition Management Committee and take&#13;
overall responsibility for the program, and for the&#13;
coordination of intersectoral inputs from the various&#13;
departments affecting nutrition as also liaison with NGOs;&#13;
assuming current proposals for Local Government reform are&#13;
realized, TNO would work with the Thana Development and&#13;
Coordination Committee on this. The PIO would take&#13;
responsibility for the distribution of food supplements, since&#13;
(s)he is already responsible for food distribution programs.&#13;
The MO (MCH) at the Thana Health Complex would handle project&#13;
performance reporting in terms of nutrition outcomes, since it&#13;
would be a part of the Thana's MCH program performance.&#13;
(ii) To ensure adequate technical support for the program, it is&#13;
proposed to appoint the Assistant Thana Family Planning Officer&#13;
as the Thana Nutrition Coordinator (TNC). For ATFPOs to be&#13;
effective as a TNC, they should be given full-time&#13;
responsibility for CBNC activities and no other tasks (on&#13;
FP/MCH) should be assigned to them. This officer would be&#13;
responsible for a) supervision of CNOs; b) the quality of&#13;
supervision of CNPs by CNOs and FWVs; and c) the pre-service&#13;
and formal in-service training of the CNPs in her Thana. The&#13;
TNC would spend ten days a month in field supervision of&#13;
project work in the villages, which would allow her to visit&#13;
each Union area once a fortnight. (S)he would provide on the&#13;
job training to the CNOs and FWVs during her supervision&#13;
visits. (S)he would assemble them for more formal in-service&#13;
training whenever necessary to correct systemic problems found&#13;
during supervision visits. (S)he would also arrange group in-&#13;
service training for CNPs identified by CNOs/FWVs as&#13;
experiencing difficulties with their tasks.&#13;
(iii) The TNC would also have primary responsibility for the pre-&#13;
service training of the CNPs in her area. Such training would&#13;
last three months at the respective Unions where the CNPs are&#13;
to work; a task which would imply 30 person-months of effort&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
91&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 16 of 16&#13;
for a typical Thana. Since TNCs would need also to supervise&#13;
newly trained workers during the first project year, sufficient&#13;
outside help will be given with pre-service training. TNCs&#13;
would devote half their time to supervision, and have all CNPs&#13;
in the Thana trained within 18 months. The exact modalities&#13;
for the outside assistance to TNCs have yet to be determined;&#13;
but this support could come from teams of additional TNCs, who&#13;
could be moved from Thana to Thana to help with pre-service&#13;
training as the program expands. Yet mother possible source of&#13;
assistance in this area would naturally be NGOs who have such a&#13;
capacity.&#13;
(c) District and Central Levels&#13;
(i) Supervision of project activities would be concentrated at the&#13;
Thana and Union levels, in line with the component's&#13;
decentralized approach. District level activities would be&#13;
limited to performance reporting to MOHFW, and feedback of&#13;
performance results to the Thana and Union levels compare&#13;
performance with each other. This information and monitoring&#13;
role at the district level would be handled by existing MOHFW&#13;
staff and will not warrant any new post creation.&#13;
(ii) After Local Government reforms, Union Parishads and Thana&#13;
Development Coordination Committees, advised by local MPs,&#13;
would have a more important role than districts in allocating&#13;
and coordinating intersectoral inputs, except in the case of&#13;
major infrastructure works. Union Parishads would negotiate&#13;
directly with Central Government departments on the amount of&#13;
resources to which their area was entitled. To encourage the&#13;
allocation of resources as far as possible according to&#13;
nutritional need, MOHFW would supply the Ministry of Local&#13;
Government with nutritional status figures by Union Parishad on&#13;
a quarterly basis. The Prime Minister's Office which would&#13;
have a cell responsible for the Nutrition Project, would carry&#13;
out periodic reviews of the relationship between departmental&#13;
resource allocation and nutritional need.&#13;

INTEGRATED NUTRITION PROJECT&#13;
Training Needs of the Project and Related Issues&#13;
Activities Prior to Initiation of the Project&#13;
Task-Oriented Curriculum Package Development&#13;
1.        Prior  to  commencement  of  the  project,  task-oriented  curriculum&#13;
packages must be developed for cadre-specific training-of-trainers (TOTs) . Task-&#13;
oriented curriculum packages should be developed for each of the following cadres&#13;
of personnel who will be involved in the project:&#13;
(a)  Nutrition Project staff, i.e., TNC, CNO, CNP, and volunteers&#13;
(b)  MOHFW staff at all levels that articulate with the project, especially&#13;
CBNC, eg., FWAs and Has at the village level, FWVs and Mas at the&#13;
Union level, etc.&#13;
(c)  Staff  from  other  sectors  whose  activities  articulate  with  the&#13;
project's at all levels. These include the District Commissioner and&#13;
representatives of Ministries at District level; Thana Nirbahi Officer&#13;
and other Thana level staff from other Ministries; school teachers,&#13;
agricultural extension workers, etc., at Thana level and below.&#13;
(d)  NGO staff working in projects that would articulate with the project&#13;
at all levels.&#13;
2.        As used here, each task-oriented cadre-specific curriculum package&#13;
includes:&#13;
(a)  Measurable  behavioral  outcome  objectives  based  on  each  cadre's&#13;
specific job/task responsibilities.&#13;
(b)  Essential  nutrition,  communication,  IEC,  management,  supervision,&#13;
financial, etc., content.&#13;
(c)  Appropriate participatory training methods that focus on learning by&#13;
doing with feedback, especially for counselling skills which are&#13;
generally very weak here.&#13;
(d)  Appropriate training materials--protocols for all tasks such as Growth&#13;
Monitoring Promotion, supplementary/complementary feeding, women and&#13;
child screening,  counseling,  etc.   Training materials  cannot be&#13;
electricity-dependent and should either be ready-made such as IEC&#13;
materials, or use local materials such as black painted boards, chalk,&#13;
etc.&#13;
(e)  Orientation to and effective use of existing and the project-specific&#13;
IEC materials&#13;
(f)  Recording and reporting forms&#13;
(g)  Tools for objective evaluation of trainees' pre-and posttest knowledge&#13;
and skill performance, for evaluation of trainees' post course&#13;
performance of their actual tasks in the field, and for gathering and&#13;
analyzing clients' feedback on trainees' actual knowledge, attitudes,&#13;
and skill performance with them in the field.&#13;
3.        Participants in the UNICEF Working Group, the IEC and Field Level&#13;
Linkages Working Groups, and other groups involved in pre-project activities&#13;
should coordinate their efforts in the following activities because of the impact&#13;
these activities have on cadre-specific task-oriented curriculum package&#13;
development and subsequently on training and supervision.&#13;
(a)  Initial needs assessment/baseline study in two Thanas selected for the&#13;
first year of the project. This baseline study should provide data&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
93&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
from the two Thanas which have direct bearing on curriculum package&#13;
development and training: actual nutritional status and needs of the&#13;
target groups, i.e., children under 24 months of age, newly married&#13;
women; women who are in their second and third trimesters of&#13;
pregnancy, and women during the first five months of lactation; belief&#13;
systems about nutrition and nutrition practices for the target groups;&#13;
and current nutrition IEC materials being used by MOHFW staff, staff&#13;
from other sectors, and NGOs.&#13;
(b)  Development and field testing of additional appropriate targeted IEC&#13;
materials.&#13;
(c)  Development of job descriptions and specific task protocols for all&#13;
cadres of the project staff at all levels. These job descriptions and&#13;
protocols are a major basis for curriculum package development for&#13;
each of the cadres of personnel to be trained.&#13;
(d)  Develop task protocols for other GOB and NGO personnel at Thana level&#13;
and below to be used in intra- and intersectoral training and&#13;
supervision. In some instances the job descriptions for cadres of&#13;
personnel from other Ministries may have to be amended in terms of&#13;
their intersectoral participation in the project.&#13;
(e)  Provide technical assistance and critical technical review of all&#13;
task-oriented curriculum packages developed.&#13;
4.        These Working Groups may wish to obtain technical assistance in&#13;
designing and conducting the baseline studies, developing and field testing&#13;
targeted IEC materials, and development and initial testing of these cadre-&#13;
specific curriculum packages from the Institute of Nutrition, Mahidol University&#13;
(INMU) and the Tamil Nadu Project.&#13;
Selection of Core Trainers&#13;
5.        The project will need at least two Bangladeshis as full-time core&#13;
trainers for the first year in two Thanas. The project core trainers should have&#13;
had theoretical training and field experience in nutrition as well as experience&#13;
in training.  They must be willing to remain in the field at Thana level and&#13;
below for weeks at a time since this is where their training and evaluation&#13;
activities will take place. Salaries for these core trainers must be well above&#13;
Government scale to attract and retain appropriately qualified trainers.&#13;
Ideally, core trainers should be involved in curriculum package and IEC&#13;
materials' development before the project actually commences.&#13;
6.        The  project  core  trainers  should be  sent  to the  Institute  of&#13;
Nutrition, Mahidol University, Bangkok, for training, field visits to successful&#13;
community nutrition projects in Thailand, discussion with field level trainers,&#13;
and serial consultation on the cadre-specific curriculum packages. They should&#13;
also have a structured study tour to the Tamil Nadu Project where they can talk&#13;
with trainers involved in that Project.&#13;
Training Activities During the First Year of the project&#13;
7.        The project core trainers will have the following functions during the&#13;
first year:&#13;
(a)  Field test task-oriented curricula packages for training TNCs as&#13;
trainers (TOT) . This field test will involve core trainers in&#13;
conducting the actual TOT for the TNCs, as well as facilitating focus&#13;
group discussions (FGDs) with the TNCs about the TOT and their&#13;
recommendations  for necessary  revisions.    Core  trainers  should&#13;
continue FGDs every four-to-six weeks during at least the first six&#13;
months of the TNCs5 actual work in the two Thanas and bimonthly&#13;
thereafter for the first year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 8&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
(b) Revise the task-oriented TOT curriculum package based on FGDs with&#13;
TNCs. Feedback should also be sought from other Thana level personnel&#13;
i.e., MOHFW, other sectors, and NGOs, as appropriate.&#13;
(c) Assist TNCs to conduct training in two thanas at Thana, Union, and&#13;
village levels for CNOs, CNPs, and CBNC volunteers using task-oriented&#13;
curricula packages.&#13;
(d) Revise task-oriented curricula based on trainees' posttest performance&#13;
and actual performance in the field and on clients' feedback in FGDs&#13;
following initial implementation of training by all cadres trained.&#13;
(e) Field test task-oriented curricula packages for training trainers of&#13;
MOHFW, other sector, and NGO personnel who will, in turn, train their&#13;
own sector or NGO staff.  (TOT)  This field test will involve core&#13;
trainers in conducting the actual TOT for trainers from MOHFW, other&#13;
sectors, and NGOs, as well as facilitating focus group discussions&#13;
(FGDs) with the trainers about the TOT and their recommendations for&#13;
necessary revisions. Core trainers should continue FGDs every four-&#13;
to-six weeks during at least the first six months of the other&#13;
sectors' trainers' actual work in the two Thanas and bimonthly&#13;
thereafter for the first year.&#13;
(f) Revise the task-oriented TOT curriculum package based on FGDs with&#13;
other sectors' trainers. Feedback should also be sought from other&#13;
Thana level personnel i.e., MOHFW, other sectors, and NGOs, as&#13;
appropriate.&#13;
(g) Assist MOHFW, other sectors', and NGOs' trainers to conduct training&#13;
in two thanas at Thana, Union, and village levels for MOHFW, other&#13;
sectors' staff, and NGO staff at as a field test of the task-oriented&#13;
curricula packages.&#13;
(h) Revise task-oriented curricula based on MOHFW, other sectors, and NGO&#13;
staffs' trainees' posttest performance and actual performance in the&#13;
field  and  on  clients'   feedback  in  FGDs   following  initial&#13;
implementation of training by all cadres trained.&#13;
(i) Assist TNCs and other supervisors in their on-going on-the-job&#13;
training and supervision of CNOs, CNPs, volunteers, linked MOHFW,&#13;
other-sectoral staff, and NGO personnel in the field. Through this&#13;
activity, the core trainers will learn first hand about the actual&#13;
problems  encountered  in  implementing  CBNC  in  the  field.    This&#13;
experience will lead to further refinements of task-oriented curricula&#13;
packages and IEC materials during the first year and to development&#13;
of effective task-oriented in-service curriculum packages for each&#13;
cadre of CBNC or linked staff.&#13;
(j) Continue to assist the TNCs in their initial training of field level&#13;
staff, implementing the first year of the project and with supervision&#13;
of the CNPs, CNOs, and volunteers, as well as the project-linked staff&#13;
from MOHFW, other sectors, and NGOs. The reasons for core trainers'&#13;
involvement in the field implementation of the project's first year&#13;
are so that the core trainers can experience, along with the trainers&#13;
and field staff--TNCs, CNPs, and CNOs, volunteers, and linked MOHFW,,&#13;
other-sectoral staff, and NGO personnel--the real field situation and&#13;
its problems.   This experience will enable the core trainers to be&#13;
more effective trainers of trainers as well as enable them to revise&#13;
curricula, training methods, and training materials to make them more&#13;
task-specific and effective.   After this experience, core trainers&#13;
will also be more effective in drafting cadre-specific task-oriented&#13;
in-service training curriculum packages for field testing.&#13;
(k) Hold FGDs with CBNC and other sectors' trainers and with selected&#13;
field level personnel from CBNC and other sectors and NGOs to what&#13;
content and skills are common to whom and thus to identify which&#13;
cadres of personnel at what levels of service delivery can be&#13;
effectively trained together for all or part of their training during&#13;
subsequent phases of the project.&#13;

Training of Staff of the proiect and other Sector and NGOs at Thana level and&#13;
Below&#13;
8.        The following principles should be followed in all TOTs and training&#13;
of all field levels the project and staff from linked GOB and NGO programs.&#13;
(a) All training will take place as close to the real field situation in&#13;
which the trainees will actually work as possible.&#13;
(b) Training should take place in existing community/village facilities&#13;
using locally available materials, eg., black painted boards with&#13;
chalk, etc.&#13;
(c) All trainers must have received appropriate TOT before they conduct&#13;
training for other the project or the project-linked personnel or&#13;
volunteers.&#13;
(d) All training must be task-oriented, i.e., focused on what trainees&#13;
will actually do in their jobs.   Knowledge,  attitude,  and skill&#13;
training should all be based on actual job expectations for each cadre&#13;
of trainee.&#13;
(e) All training methods should be active. "Learn by doing" with&#13;
supervision and  feedback  is  the goal.    All  skills,  especially&#13;
counseling skills, must be practiced repeatedly with supervision and&#13;
feedback, until trainees can do them effectively according to&#13;
protocols for their cadre. Actual performance should be observed for&#13;
assessment. This is also a basis for field supervision.&#13;
(f)  Training materials should be actual IEC materials or locally made&#13;
materials  such as black painted boards,  chalk,  etc.,  that  are&#13;
effective and portable.&#13;
Training Activities in Subseciuent Years of the project&#13;
9.        The project core trainers will conduct TOTs to train additional&#13;
trainers from the project staff as well as from MOHFW, other sectors, and NGOs,&#13;
who will work as trainers in the Thanas added to the project. Core trainers will&#13;
provide these trainers with supportive supervision and in-service training. They&#13;
will also seek feedback from them for necessary revisions in task-oriented cadre-&#13;
specific basic and in-service curriculum packages.&#13;

INTEGRATED NUTRITION PROJECT&#13;
Selection Criteria - Community Nutrition Promoters&#13;
1.        The key persons for project implementation at the village level&#13;
would be the female Community Nutrition Promoters (CNPs). CNPs would have a&#13;
first-line responsibility for nutrition monitoring and promotion, including&#13;
daily supplementation of eligible women and children and follow-up with&#13;
defaulters.&#13;
2.        Successful implementation of the project would depend on CNPs'&#13;
conscientious performance of their duties and on their close rapport with&#13;
their target population. CNPs would therefore not be presented as an&#13;
additional cadre of salaried government employees, but rather as village women&#13;
with special competencies who would be accountable to the village population&#13;
whom they serve.&#13;
3.        CNPs would receive about 100 taka per week in the case of the&#13;
vulnerable group strategy, and about 75 taka per week in the case of the newly&#13;
married strategy. Payment of a honorarium is considered necessary to&#13;
compensate CNPs for their time, sustain continuity of service, and to achieve&#13;
the increased discipline and accountability that result from the payment.&#13;
4.        CNPs should preferably be women from the poorer section of the com-&#13;
munity who have well nourished children; such women, even before training,&#13;
would possess some maternal and child care skills which they could pass on to&#13;
others in the community. To ensure easy access and social acceptability to&#13;
their clients they would have to be resident in the village where they serve.&#13;
CNPs would have a minimum education of 8th class or equivalent. To ensure&#13;
sufficient skills for growth monitoring and reporting and interpersonal&#13;
communications candidates would, in addition, need to pass a simple competency&#13;
and aptitude test. Willingness to serve the whole village, including the&#13;
poorer and more remote neighborhoods, would be an important additional&#13;
selection criterion.&#13;
5.        Accountability to the village community would be established by&#13;
inviting nominations for the initial selection of CNPs from the community, by&#13;
providing feedback information on the community-based interventions to the&#13;
village community, and by requiring periodic reconfirmations of CNPs by the&#13;
communities that they are serving.&#13;
6.        Initial nominations of CNPs would be invited from within each of&#13;
the village neighborhoods (paras), from any existing organized village devel-&#13;
opment groups, and, once formed, from Village Development Committees. Village&#13;
communities would be kept informed of the coverage and performance of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
97&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
community-based interventions through visual displays of key performance data&#13;
and through periodic meetings with the village leadership by CNPs and CNOs, in&#13;
which the strengths and weaknesses of local nutrition monitoring and promotion&#13;
efforts would be reviewed. Groups involved in the initial nominations would&#13;
also be consulted on the periodic reconfirmations of CNPs, which would be a&#13;
means of replacing CNPs who no longer have the trust of the community that&#13;
they serve.&#13;

INTEGRATED NUTRITION PROJECT&#13;
Selection Criteria - Sub-projects Financed from the Inter-Sectoral Fund&#13;
1.        The following questions should be analyzed and answered in the&#13;
affirmative for a sub-project proposal to be cleared for financing from the&#13;
proposed inter-sectoral nutrition fund:&#13;
(a) Does the proposed sub-project have the potential to make a significant&#13;
impact on malnutrition in Bangladesh by addressing a major known&#13;
mechanism for improving nutrition that falls outside the normal range&#13;
of "nutrition programs" such as women's education or youth programs,&#13;
or provision of information on nutrition through programs outside the&#13;
health sector?&#13;
(b) Will it address problems faced by poorer segments of the population?&#13;
(c) Is it technically sound? Is it adequately staffed? Does it include&#13;
adequate measurements by which progress can be gauged? Is it&#13;
consistent with state-of -the -art understanding of nutrition?&#13;
(d) Does the proposal have the full support of senior staff in the&#13;
concerned ministry or department?&#13;
(e) Is there assurance that beyond the seed money provided by the Fund,&#13;
adequate project support will be provided by the concerned ministry&#13;
or department?&#13;
(f) Where re-orientation of an existing activity is considered, is there&#13;
assurance that this activity itself is viable and assured of adequate&#13;
continuing funding?&#13;
(g) Has the ministry or department made adequate provision for monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of the new or re-oriented project as a whole?&#13;
&#13;

Note; The disbursement percentages projected for this project broadly match the&#13;
disbursement profile for Bank-financed social sector projects except for the initial&#13;
three years when the project is expected to disburse smaller amounts due to the&#13;
gradual phasing of its core component.&#13;

            The Integrated Nutrition Project will
            initiate development of a national nutrition program whose
            long-term goal is to improve nutritional status so that
            malnutrition would eventually cease to be a public health
            problem. The project will have three components.. The
            National level nutrition activities component includes four
            sub-components: 1) program development and institution
            building, to develop national capacity in nutrition and to
            promote needed policy research and operation research; 2)
            information, education and communication (IEC) development
            to assess current behavioral aspects relevant to nutrition
            an develop appropriate messages and materials for use in IEC
            activities through inter-personal methods at the community
            level and through the mass media at the national level; 3)
            strengthening of existing nutition activities; and 4)
            project management, monitoring and evaluation. The
            community-based nutrition component focuses on growth
            monitoring and promotion activities with targeted and
            supervised supplementary feeding at the village level in
            community nutrition centers, which will serve as a locus for
            inter-personal IEC and mobilization of community actions to
            promote nutrition. The inter-sectoral nutrition program
            development will improve nutrition by emphasizing
            nutritional aspects of activities in various sectors and by
            supporting innovative actions with potential nutrition impact.
