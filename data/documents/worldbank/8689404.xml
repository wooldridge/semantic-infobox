Foreword&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agriculture is a vital development tool for achieving the Millennium Development Goal&#13;
that calls for halving by 2015 the share of people suffering from extreme poverty and hun-&#13;
ger. That is the overall message of this year's World Development Report (WDR), the 30th in&#13;
the series. Three out of every four poor people in developing countries live in rural areas,&#13;
and most of them depend directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihoods. This&#13;
Report provides guidance to governments and the international community on designing&#13;
and implementing agriculture-for-development agendas that can make a difference in the&#13;
lives of hundreds of millions of rural poor.&#13;
   The Report highlights two major regional challenges. In much of Sub-Saharan Africa,&#13;
agriculture is a strong option for spurring growth, overcoming poverty, and enhancing food&#13;
security. Agricultural productivity growth is vital for stimulating growth in other parts of&#13;
the economy. But accelerated growth requires a sharp productivity increase in smallholder&#13;
farming combined with more effective support to the millions coping as subsistence farm-&#13;
ers, many of them in remote areas. Recent improved performance holds promise, and this&#13;
Report identifies many emerging successes that can be scaled up.&#13;
   In Asia, overcoming widespread poverty requires confronting widening rural-urban&#13;
income disparities. Asia's fast-growing economies remain home to over 600 million rural&#13;
people living in extreme poverty, and despite massive rural-urban migration, rural poverty&#13;
will remain dominant for several more decades. For this reason, the WDR focuses on ways&#13;
to generate rural jobs by diversifying into labor-intensive, high-value agriculture linked to&#13;
a dynamic rural, nonfarm sector.&#13;
   In all regions, with rising land and water scarcity and the added pressures of a globalizing&#13;
world, the future of agriculture is intrinsically tied to better stewardship of natural resources.&#13;
With the right incentives and investments, agriculture's environmental footprint can be&#13;
lightened, and environmental services harnessed to protect watersheds and biodiversity.&#13;
   Today, rapidly expanding domestic and global markets; institutional innovations in&#13;
markets, finance, and collective action; and revolutions in biotechnology and information&#13;
technology all offer exciting opportunities to use agriculture to promote development. But&#13;
seizing these opportunities will require the political will to move forward with reforms that&#13;
improve the governance of agriculture.&#13;
   Ultimately, success will also depend on concerted action by the international develop-&#13;
ment community to confront the challenges ahead. We must level the playing field in inter-&#13;
national trade; provide global public goods, such as technologies for tropical food staples;&#13;
help developing countries address climate change; and overcome looming health pandem-&#13;
ics for plants, animals, and humans. At stake are the livelihoods of 900 million rural poor,&#13;
who also deserve to share the benefits of a sustainable and inclusive globalization.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
I  n the 21st century, agriculture continues to be a fundamental instrument for sustainable&#13;
   development and poverty reduction. Three of every four poor people in developing&#13;
   countries live in rural areas--2.1 billion living on less than $2 a day and 880 million on&#13;
less than $1 a day--and most depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Given where they&#13;
are and what they do best, promoting agriculture is imperative for meeting the Millennium&#13;
Development Goal of halving poverty and hunger by 2015 and reducing poverty and&#13;
hunger for several decades thereafter. Agriculture alone will not be enough to massively&#13;
reduce poverty, but it is an essential component of effective development strategies for most&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
With the last World Development Report on agriculture completed 25 years ago, it is&#13;
necessary to redefine how agriculture can be used for development, taking account of the&#13;
vastly different context of opportunities and challenges that has emerged. To do this, the&#13;
Report--Agriculture for Development-- addresses three main questions:&#13;
&#13;
· What can agriculture do for development? Agriculture has effectively served as a basis&#13;
  for growth and reduced poverty in many countries, but many more countries could&#13;
  benefit if governments and donors were to reverse years of policy neglect and remedy&#13;
  their underinvestment and misinvestment in agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
· What are effective instruments in using agriculture for development? They include&#13;
  increasing the assets of poor households, making smallholders--and agriculture in&#13;
  general--more productive, and creating opportunities in the rural nonfarm economy&#13;
  that the rural poor can seize.&#13;
&#13;
· How can agriculture-for-development agendas best be implemented? By designing&#13;
  policies and decision-making processes suited to each country's economic and social&#13;
  conditions, mobilizing political support, and improving the governance of agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
This year's Report marks the 30th year the World Bank has been publishing the World&#13;
Development Report.&#13;

            World development report 2008 : agriculture
            for development - overview
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall message of this year's
            World Development Report (WDR), the 30th in the series is
            that agriculture is a vital development tool for achieving
            the millennium development goal that calls for halving by
            2015 the share of people suffering from extreme poverty and
            hunger. This report provides guidance to governments and the
            international community on designing and implementing
            agriculture-for-development agendas that can make a
            difference in the lives of hundreds of millions of rural
            poor. The report highlights two major regional challenges.
            In much of Sub-Saharan Africa, agriculture is a strong
            option for spurring growth, overcoming poverty, and
            enhancing food security, whereas in Asia, and overcoming
            widespread poverty requires confronting widening rural-urban
            income disparities. This report addresses three main
            questions: 1) What can agriculture do for development? 2)
            What are effective instruments in using agriculture for
            development? 3) How can agriculture-for-development agendas
            best be implemented?
