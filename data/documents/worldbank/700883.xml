A Social Methodology for&#13;
Community Participation in Local Investments:&#13;
The Experience of Mexico's PIDER Program&#13;
ABSTRACT&#13;
The PIDER rural development program in Mexico has carried out a&#13;
large-scale effort for the social engineering of beneficiary participation.&#13;
This paper outlines the history and experiences involved in building up,&#13;
within the implementing agency, a coherent social methodology for eliciting&#13;
farmers' participation in identifying priority local investments and&#13;
implementing them. The methodology to promote peasant participation was&#13;
articulated only gradually, with help from sociologists and other social&#13;
scientists, through a long process of designing-testing-learning-revising;&#13;
action research and social experiments at the community and microregional&#13;
level were carried out to test and reformulate the participatory approach.&#13;
The methodology refers to various stages of the project cycle:&#13;
identification of local investments, planning, implementation, monitoring.&#13;
Constraints on the application of the participatory program include the&#13;
rigidity of the bureaucratic structure, cultural constraints, opposition to&#13;
peasant participation for political reasons, interagency conflicts over policy&#13;
and procedural issues, and the absence or weakness of village-based peasant&#13;
organizations.&#13;

OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY&#13;
The PIDER 1/ program was initiated in 1973 as a large investment program&#13;
for the implementation of small-scale, local projects in some of the poorest&#13;
areas of Mexico. The community orientation of the investments necessitated a new&#13;
approach which would involve members of the community themselves in planning and&#13;
implementation. The importance given to encouraging and organizing beneficiary&#13;
participation has become a defining characteristic of the PIDER program. Through&#13;
a long-term social engineering effort, based on experimenting and learning, a&#13;
coherent methodology for eliciting beneficiary participation was developed. This&#13;
paper will (a) analyze how the participatory methodology has been produced; (b)&#13;
outline the methodology for participatory planning in community development and&#13;
point out its innovative features; (c) review PIDER's actual experiences with&#13;
peasant participation; and (d) discuss the constraints and limitations of this&#13;
methodology.&#13;
The social engineering and learning process which produced the&#13;
methodology for participation was based on the premise that the farmers'&#13;
perspective is a critical input for successful development planning. Experiences&#13;
in implementation of PIDER repeatedly showed that traditional, top-down&#13;
bureaucratic planning procedures had serious drawbacks and that conventional&#13;
planners very often failed. Farmers typically had specific, locally significant&#13;
information about their social and economic environment which, when ignored by&#13;
planners, led to difficulties or failures in project implementation.&#13;
Participation was the necessary avenue to pursue -- not just for political or&#13;
ideological motives, but primarily for increased efficiency and reasons of an&#13;
economic and technical nature.&#13;
The process of designing-testing-learning-revising the participatory&#13;
procedures is one of the most interesting experiences of PIDER. Each idea was&#13;
put through field tests at the community level, and its results were analyzed,&#13;
revised according to experience, and retested. Only after this lengthy back-&#13;
and-forth cycle could the resulte be codified into a coherent set of procedures.&#13;
Elaborating such a methodology required the multidisciplinary skills of&#13;
professional social researchers and development practitioners, who jointly could&#13;
design for "software" and build up the capacity of development agencies.&#13;
PIDER1e social engineering involved real-life social experiments, as&#13;
opposed to ivory-tower concoction of schemes; it required patient observation of&#13;
these experiments, learning from errors, and repeated returns to the drawing&#13;
board. Training was critical, since the results had to be communicated to, and&#13;
learned by, the client audience. Sustained political&#13;
1/ Originally, "Programa de Inversiones para el Desarrollo Rural" (Investment&#13;
Program for Rural Development); subsequently changed to "Programa Integral&#13;
para el Desarrollo Rural" (Integrated Program for Rural Development).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

commitment iD support of the social engineering approach proved essential for&#13;
fighting off tbe bureaucratic and vested-interest obstacles, and the shift&#13;
from experimentation to normative institutionalization had to be made at the&#13;
right time.  Adeguate staffing and organizational rearrangements also proved&#13;
to be indispensable for carrying out the social engineering effectively.&#13;
The conceptual framework of the methodology i8 based upon: (a)&#13;
self-definition of interests by the community, (b) community diagnosis, (c)&#13;
regional integration, and (d) iterative planning. Adhering to these&#13;
principles permits information about the community to be properly organized;&#13;
it develops a sense of commitment to the project among beneficiaries; it&#13;
allows for a conscious priority ranking of investment needs; and it ensures&#13;
that sufficient time is given to reflect upon and prepare the investment&#13;
program while avoiding an authoritarian approach.&#13;
Information dissemination is recognized as an essential component of&#13;
the participatory methodology. PIDER's guidelines for information and&#13;
motivation address two publics: the rural inhabitants and agency personnel.&#13;
They specify how rural communities may best be informed about PIDER's&#13;
objectives, strategies, and actions; they recommend methods to ensure that the&#13;
peasants can make informed decisions about their own participation; and they&#13;
also emphasize compliance of agency staff with timetables. The guidelines&#13;
further instruct agency staff about the aims and objectives of increasing&#13;
participation. The methodology tends to rely on the political empowerment&#13;
effects of information dissemination as a means "to increase the beneficiary&#13;
population's bargaining position with the agencies and entities taking part in&#13;
the Program."&#13;
The programming procedures are divided into three phases: (a) field&#13;
assessment, (b) prelíminary programming, and (c) final programming. In each&#13;
phase the roles of both agencies and community groups are carefully defined.&#13;
The procedures for each atage cover both the sociological and technical&#13;
elements of investmient planning, prescribing what has to be done at the&#13;
community level and also what technical-economic feasibility analyses should&#13;
be undertaken by the specialized agencies.&#13;
During the field assessment, data are collected on existing&#13;
population, infrastructure, and resources in the region; past programs are&#13;
assessed; communities are selected for the program; each selected locality i¡&#13;
studied througb field visíts, a diagnosis is made, and an assessment report is&#13;
prepared. It i8 in this first stage that repeated consultations with&#13;
beneficiary communities to determine priorities and to identify the&#13;
development potential are arranged as the beginning of community&#13;
participation.&#13;
In the second phase, preliminary programming, integrated investment&#13;
plans are prepared by the sectoral on-line agencies. These plano check for&#13;
the internal cohesion of the project; they estimate project benefits, and they&#13;
determine the unit-investment parameters of PIDER.&#13;
The last stage, final programming, finalizes the specific project&#13;
plans from the microregional perspective, ensuring that technical and economic&#13;
feasibility has been achieved. The final program i8 then communicated to the&#13;
community, and any changes are clearly spelled out and explained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ix -&#13;
Participation in project implementation is the next stage addressed&#13;
by PIDER's methodology, after programming. Beneficiaries are expected to&#13;
contribute their share as a fraction of the total costs of the state-funded&#13;
investments. Specific coefficients were introduced for different types of&#13;
investments. Participation becomes, in this stage, a strategy for local&#13;
resource mobilization, ideally pursuing at the same time behavioral,&#13;
attitudinal, and motivational changes among beneficiaries.&#13;
Participation in monitoring the execution of local investments is&#13;
another area in which PIDER considered that direct involvement of&#13;
beneficiaries might be an efficient, though nonconventional, solution.&#13;
Innovative attempts to build the representatives of project communities into&#13;
the monitoring mechanism were made with excellent results. Yet, the overall&#13;
methodology for participatory implementation and monitoring has not been&#13;
sufficiently worked out and generalized; the great potential for participatory&#13;
monitoring has remained by and large unused and it is now being still explored.&#13;
The application of the participatory model in PIDER over time has&#13;
made gradual progress and has been extended to many microregions, but in a&#13;
rather uneven manner both territorially and in terms of the various stages of&#13;
the project cycle. Available evidence points to both success and serious&#13;
constraínts and weaknesses. The decentralization process launched under PIDER&#13;
III has yielded substantial institutional changes aud has created a more&#13;
propitious framework for participation; yet reforming the bureaucratic&#13;
procedures at the lower levels of the state administration has run into many&#13;
obstacles endogenous and exogenous to the bureaucracy itself. The review of&#13;
recent physical achíevements under the PIDER program confirms, however, the&#13;
necessity and soundness of the participatory orientation.&#13;
The constraints on the application of the social methodology for&#13;
participation, as suggested by PIDER's own experiences, are further analyzed&#13;
in detail. They are of both an organizational-bureaucratic and&#13;
societal-structural nature. The problems in achieving optimum levels of&#13;
participation include the rigidity of the bureaucratic structure, which,&#13;
because of its internal patterns and priorities, creates time and staffing&#13;
obstacles to genuine field work; cultural constraints, in the form of the&#13;
established value systems of technicians and planners who are called upon to&#13;
adopt new planning strategies; interagency conflicts over policy or programs;&#13;
and structural-societal constraints, resulting from the position of certain&#13;
vested-interest groups who are opposed to peasants' increased local&#13;
participation in ínvestnent decision-making and who attempt to maintain their&#13;
political gríp over resources and local affairs.&#13;
A particularly vulnerable aspect of the participatory program&#13;
methodology is the continued lack of guidelines for building stable forms of&#13;
farmer organizations or for usíng the exísting ones and strengtheníng them.&#13;
Little work has been done to develop the peasant organizatíons which can best&#13;
interact with technical agencies and which can provide the most effective&#13;
structure for maintaíning infrastructural assets buílt through projects.&#13;
Finally, further expansion of the participatory methodology should be&#13;
oriented toward other phases of the project cycle. This can be achieved&#13;
through improvíng the methodology for participation in implementation,&#13;
monitoring, operation, and maintenance.&#13;

PRESENTACION GENERAL Y RESUMEN&#13;
El PIDER 1/ se inició en 1973 como un programa de inversiones de&#13;
gran envergadura para la ejecución de proyectos locales de pequeña escala&#13;
en algunas de las zonas más pobres de México. La orientación de las&#13;
inversiones en beneficio de la comunidad hizo necesario un nuevo enfoque&#13;
que involucrase a los propios habitantes de las localidades en las activi-&#13;
dades de planificación y ejecución. La importancia conferida al fomento y&#13;
organización de la participación de los beneficiarios se ha convertido en&#13;
una característica peculiar del PIDER. Mediante una actividad de largo&#13;
plazo en el campo de la ingeniería social, basada en la experimentación y&#13;
el aprendizaje, se ha desarrollado una metodología coherente para obtener&#13;
esa participación de los beneficiarios. Este documento tiene por finali-&#13;
dad: a) analizar la forma en que se ha producido la metodología partici-&#13;
patoria; b) reseñar la metodología para la planificación participatoria&#13;
del desarrollo de la comunidad y señalar sus rasgos innovadores; c) pasar&#13;
revista a las experiencias reales del PIDER en cuanto a la participación&#13;
de los campesinos, y d) examinar los factores limitativos de esta&#13;
metodología.&#13;
La ingeniería social y el proceso de aprendizaje que produjeron&#13;
la metodología para la participación comunitaria tuvieron como base la&#13;
premisa de que el punto de vista de los agricultores es un elemento esen-&#13;
cial para el éxito de la planificación del desarrollo. La experiencia en&#13;
la ejecución del PIDER demostró repetidamente que los procedimientos&#13;
tradicionales de planificación de arriba abajo en la estructura burocrá-&#13;
tica presentaban graves inconveníentes y que a menudo fracasaban los&#13;
planificadores tradicionales. Eran frecuentes los casos en que los agri-&#13;
cultores poseían informaciones específicas y localmente significativas&#13;
acerca de su medio social y económico que, al ser ignoradas por los plani-&#13;
ficadores, conducían a dificultades o fracasos en la ejecución de los pro-&#13;
yectos. El derrotero que se precisaba seguir era el de la participación,&#13;
no solamente por motivos políticos o ideológicos, sino principalmente con&#13;
miras a lograr una mayor eficiencia, y por razones de carácter económico y&#13;
técnico.&#13;
Una de las experiencias más interesantes del PIDER es el proceso&#13;
de diseño, prueba, aprendizaje y revisión de los sistemas de participa-&#13;
ción. Cada idea se puso a prueba en el terreno a nivel comunitario y los&#13;
resultados obtenidos fueron analizados, modificados en función de la&#13;
experiencia y sometidos a nuevas pruebas. Tan sólo después de este pro-&#13;
longado ciclo de iteración pudieron codificarse los resultados en un con-&#13;
junto coherente de procedimientos.&#13;
1/ El nombre original "Programa de Inversíones para el Desarrollo Rural"&#13;
fue reemplazado posteriormente por el de "Programa Integral para el&#13;
Desarrollo Rural."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
La elaboración de esa metodología exigía los conocimientos mul-&#13;
tidisciplinarios de investigadores sociales profesionales y de especialis-&#13;
tas dedicados a las cuestiones del desarrollo que pudieran diseñar conjun-&#13;
tamente los componentes lógicos necesarios y fortalecer la capacidad de&#13;
los organismos en el campo del desarrollo.&#13;
La ingeniería social del PIDER involucró experimentos sociales&#13;
de la vida real, a diferencia de la elaboración de planes artificiosos&#13;
desde una torre de marfil; exigió la observación paciente de dichos expe-&#13;
rimentos, el aprendizaje derivado de los errores cometidos, y repetidos&#13;
retornos al tablero de diseño. La capacitación fue elemento crítico,&#13;
puesto que debieron comunicarse los resultados a los beneficiarios para&#13;
que éstos los aprendiesen. Un compromiso político sostenido en apoyo de&#13;
la ingeniería social resultó esencial para repeler los obstáculos burocrá-&#13;
ticos y los intereses creados, y el movimiento de la experimentación hacia&#13;
la institucionalización normativa tuvo que hacerse en el momento oportuno.&#13;
La dotación adecuada de personal y la reorganización institucional fueron&#13;
también indispensables a fin de aplicar la ingeniería social de manera&#13;
efectiva.&#13;
El marco conceptual de la metodología se basa en lo siguiente:&#13;
a) definición de intereses por la propia comunidad, b) diagnóstico comuni-&#13;
tario, c) integración regional y d) planificación sobre una base itera-&#13;
tiva. La observancia de estos principios permite que la información&#13;
acerca de la comunidad se organice adecuadamente; crea entre los benefi-&#13;
ciarios un espíritu de compromiso para con el proyecto; hace posible una&#13;
consciente ordenación de prioridades de las necesidades de inversión y&#13;
asegura que se conceda tiempo suficiente-para reflexionar sobre el pro-&#13;
grama de inversiones y para prepararlo, en tanto que se evita un sistema&#13;
autoritario.&#13;
Se reconoce que la divulgación de la información es un compo-&#13;
nente esencial de la metodología participatoria. Las pautas del PIDER&#13;
con respecto a informacíón y motivación están dirigidas a dos clases de&#13;
público: los habitantes de las zonas rurales y el personal de las insti-&#13;
tuciones. Dichas pautas especifican cómo se puede informar de la mejor&#13;
manera a-las comunidades rurales acerca de los objetivos, estrategias y&#13;
actividades del PIDER; recomiendan los métodos para asegurar que los cam-&#13;
pesinos puedan tomar decisiones fundamentadas acerca de su propia partici-&#13;
pación, y también controlan la observancia de los calendarios de activida-&#13;
des por el personal de las instituciones. Además, en ellas se instruye al&#13;
personal de las instituciones acerca de las metas y objetivos de una&#13;
participación creciente. La metodología se basa en los efectos de la&#13;
divulgación de la información en cuanto hace a otorgar poder político como&#13;
medio de "acrecentar la posición de la población beneficiaria en sus nego-&#13;
ciaciones con las instituciones y los organismos que participan en el&#13;
Programa".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ixii&#13;
Los procedimientos de la programación comprenden tres etapas:&#13;
a) evaluación en el terreno, b) programación preliminar y c) programación&#13;
definitiva. En cada etapa se definen cuidadosamente las funciones tanto&#13;
de las instituciones como de los grupos comunitarios. Los procedimientos&#13;
correspondientes a cada etapa comprenden los elementos tanto sociológicos&#13;
como técnicos de la planificación de las inversiones, al prescribir lo que&#13;
tiene que hacerse a nivel comunitario y los análisis de viabilidad técnica&#13;
y económica que deben efectuar los organismos especializados.&#13;
Durante la evaluación en el terreno se recolectan datos sobre la&#13;
población, infraestructura y recursos existentes en la región; se evalúan&#13;
los programas pasados; se seleccionan las comunidades para el programa; se&#13;
estudia, mediante visitas en el terreno, cada una de las localidades&#13;
seleccionadas, se formula un diagnóstico, y se prepara un informe de&#13;
evaluación. Es en esta primera etapa cuando, como iniciación de la parti-&#13;
cipación comunitaria, se organizan repetidas consultas con las comunidades&#13;
beneficiarias a fin de determinar las prioridades e identificar las posi-&#13;
bilidades de desarrollo.&#13;
En la segunda etapa, de programación preliminar, los organismos&#13;
del sector correspondiente preparan planes integrados de inversión. Estos&#13;
planes verifican la cohesión interna del proyecto respectivo; en ellos se&#13;
estiman los beneficios del proyecto y se determinan los parámetros de las&#13;
inversiones unitarias del PIDER.&#13;
La última etapa, la programación definitiva, pone fin a los&#13;
planes específicos del proyecto desde el punto de vista microrregional,&#13;
asegurando que se haya alcanzado la viabilidad técnica y económica. Se da&#13;
a conocer entonces a la comunidad el programa definitivo, describiendo y&#13;
explicando claramente cualesquiera cambios introducidos.&#13;
La siguiente etapa dentro de la metodología del PIDER, después&#13;
de la programación, es la participación en la ejecución del proyecto. Se&#13;
espera que los beneficiarios contribuyan la parte que les corresponde en&#13;
los costos totales de las inversiones hechas con fondos aportados por el&#13;
Estado. Se introdujeron coefícientes específicos para los diferentes&#13;
tipos de inversiones. En esta etapa la participación se convierte en una&#13;
estrategia para la movilización de recursos locales, buscando al mismo&#13;
tiempo la introducción de cambios en el comportamiento, las actitudes y&#13;
las motivaciones de los beneficiarios.&#13;
El seguimiento de la ejecución de las inversiones locales es&#13;
otro campo en el que el PIDER consideró que la participación directa de&#13;
los beneficiarios podía ser una solución eficiente, aunque no convencio-&#13;
nal. Se han hecho, con resultados excelentes, intentos innovadores por&#13;
incorporar en el mecanismo de seguimiento a los representantes de las&#13;
comunidades comprendidas en los proyectos. Sin embargo, la metodología&#13;
general en cuanto a la participación en la ejecución y en el seguimiento&#13;
no se ha perfeccionado ni generalizado en grado suficíente y virtualmente&#13;
no se han puesto en juego las posibilidades en lo que respecta a la parti-&#13;
cipación en el seguimiento.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
xiii:&#13;
La aplicación del método participatorio en el PIDER ha progre-&#13;
sado gradualmente y se ha extendido a numerosas microrregiones, pero de&#13;
una manera más bien desigual tanto desde el punto de vista territorial&#13;
como en cuanto hace a las diversas etapas del ciclo de los proyectos. Los&#13;
hechos indican éxitos y al mismo tiempo graves factores limitativos. El&#13;
proceso de descentralización iniciado en virtud del PIDER III ha producido&#13;
apreciables cambios institucionales y creado un marco más propicio para la&#13;
participación; pero la reforma de los procedimientos burocráticos en los&#13;
niveles más bajos de la administración estatal ha tropezado con muchos&#13;
obstáculos tanto endógenos como exógenos a la propia burocracia. El&#13;
examen de las realizaciones físicas alcanzadas recientemente en virtud del&#13;
PIDER confirma, sin embargo, la necesidad y la bondad de la orientación&#13;
participatoria.&#13;
Se analizan además en detalle los factores limitativos que exis-&#13;
ten para la aplicación de la metodología social en cuanto a la participa-&#13;
ción, según lo indican las propias experiencias del PIDER. Tales factores&#13;
son de carácter tanto orgánico-burocrático como socioestructural. Entre&#13;
los problemas que impiden alcanzar niveles óptimos de participación figu-&#13;
ran la rigidez de la estructura burocrática que, en razón de la programa-&#13;
ción y fijación de prioridades en su orden interno, crea obstáculos de&#13;
tiempo y de personal a la realización de un auténtico trabajo de campo;&#13;
los factores limitativos culturales, representados por los sistemas de&#13;
valores establecidos de los técnicos y planificadores encargados de adop-&#13;
tar nuevas estrategias de planificación; los conflictos interinstituciona-&#13;
les acerca de políticas o programas, y los factores limitativos socioes-&#13;
tructurales, que se derivan de la posición de ciertos grupos con intereses&#13;
creados que se oponen a la creciente participación local de los campesinos&#13;
en la formulación de decisiones sobre inversiones e intentan mantener el&#13;
control político sobre los recursos y los asuntos locales.&#13;
Un aspecto especialmente vulnerable de la metodología de los&#13;
programas participatorios es la constante falta de pautas para la creación&#13;
de formas estables de organizaciones de agricultores. Muy poco es lo que&#13;
se ha hecho para desarrollar las organizaciones de campesinos que puedan&#13;
colaborar de la mejor manera con los organismos de ejecución y proporcio-&#13;
nar el marco más efectivo para el mantenimiento de las obras de infraes-&#13;
tructura construídas a través de los proyectos.&#13;
Finalmente, la expansión adicional de la metodología participa-&#13;
toria deberá orientarse hacia otras etapas del ciclo de los proyectos.&#13;
Esto puede alcanzarse mediante el mejoramiento de esa metodología en lo&#13;
que respecta a la particípación en las activídades de ejecución, segui-&#13;

I. PIDER: A LARGE-SCALE PROGRAM OF SMALL INVESTMENTS&#13;
From its inception, the PIDER 1/ program was established in Mexico to&#13;
channel substantial resources into low-income, underdeveloped rural areas. It&#13;
was designed as a giant nationwide program for financing a broad range of&#13;
small investments at community level, in order to enhance the productive&#13;
capacity and the social infrastructure of these communities. Under this&#13;
program, Mexico will havxe spent by the end of 1983, over about ten years, some&#13;
US$2 billion in 139 PIDER microregions, including more than 9,000 communities&#13;
with roughly 12 million inhabitants.&#13;
1. Investments for Poverty Alleviation&#13;
During the last five to six decades, a pattern of uneven development&#13;
has characterized Mexico's overall growth, investment patterns, productivity&#13;
levels, and income distribution between the urban and rural sectors. Within&#13;
the rural sector itself, a dualistic growth pattern has left the bulk of the&#13;
rural poor deprived of the benefits of development. 2/ One-third of the&#13;
agricultural labor force is landless. Increased under- and unemployment in&#13;
rural areas has led to a dramatic rise in rural-urban migration. Despite the&#13;
1/ Initially, PIDER meant "Programa de Inversiones para el Desarrollo Rural&#13;
(Investment Program for Rural Development). Subsequently, the name of the&#13;
program was changed to "Programa Integral para el Desarrollo Rural"&#13;
(Integrated Program for Rural Development), as it is called today.&#13;
2/ For an in-depth analysis of the socioeconomic and cultural structures of&#13;
Mexico's underdevelopment, and its current agrarian constrainta and&#13;
contradictiona in particular, the interested reader may consult the&#13;
studies of Rodolfo Stavenhagen and Pablo Gonzales Casanova, referred to in&#13;

gains of the "green revolution," agricultural development has been slow and&#13;
significantly below the population growth rate; this has brought Mexico among&#13;
the world's four largest importers of grain. Thus, as a program to alleviate&#13;
rural poverty and íncrease agricultural production, productivity, and&#13;
employment through accelerated investments of public funds into the most&#13;
depressed areas of Mexico, PIDER was badly needed.&#13;
Early in PIDER's beginnings, the Mexican government requested World&#13;
Bank support for the PIDER program. A loan for US$110 million was approved in&#13;
1975 under the Bank-assisted PIDER I project, to support development in thirty&#13;
microregions; this project was completed in 1980. A second loan of US$120&#13;
million for the PIDER II project (additional twenty microregions) was approved&#13;
in 1977 and completed by end-1982. (Key components and figures for PIDER I&#13;
and PIDER II projects are described in Annex I.) A third loan for US$175&#13;
million for the PIDER III project (seventeen microregions) was approved in&#13;
1981 and arrangements have been made in 1983 to adjust the disbursement of&#13;
this loan to the difficulties resulting from Mexico's economic crisis. 1/ (See&#13;
Annex II for detailed figures on the ongoing PIDER III project.) The&#13;
territorial spread of the PIDER microregions over the thirty-one states of&#13;
Mexico can be seen on the two maps at the end of this paper.&#13;
PIDER's objectives have expanded during its existence. Its strategy&#13;
has undergone changes, and the administrative-institutional mechanisms through&#13;
which it has been implemented have been strengthened, made more flexible, and&#13;
decentralized. PIDER as such has operated as a coordinating program and not&#13;
as a self-sufficient and self-contained agency. Located within the Federal&#13;
Secretariat of Programming and Budgeting (Secretaria de Programacion y&#13;
1/ PIDER is also internationally supported through loans from the&#13;
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the International Fund for&#13;
Agriculture (IFAD).&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Presupuesto, SPP) PIDER does not execute investments itself but operates as a&#13;
program that involves multiple technical line agencies in a coordinated&#13;
administrative-financial mechanism for channeling investment funds for&#13;
specífic small rural projects. The PIDER program has therefore a relatively&#13;
limited special staff within the SPP at federal and atate levels, but the&#13;
program has been backstopped by other SPP departments and has absorbed&#13;
full-time numerous staff of various other agencies and state governments in&#13;
PIDER-financed activities.&#13;
2. Why Participation?&#13;
Given the very nature of PIDER, a policy and implementation issue of&#13;
cardinal importance has been, and is, the participation of its beneficiaries&#13;
in investment identification, execution, and use. In a way, PIDER is unique&#13;
in that the enormous financial resources it controls are not invested in a&#13;
handful of huge and extremely costly projects, but in thousands and thousands&#13;
of small projects, tailored to the needs and size of small villages or of&#13;
subgroups within these communitie-s.  Such investments are made, for example,&#13;
for small-scale irrigation, soil conservation projects, fruit tree&#13;
plantations, rural roads, fishponds, livestock units, rural health points,&#13;
schools, potable water systems, village electrification, etc. This has made&#13;
it of paramount importance to ensure the actual involvement of the intended&#13;
beneficiaries in identifying -- among the infinite number of possible local&#13;
investments -- which are the priority ones, which ones will make better use of&#13;
the local resources, and which ones will address the most burning local needs.&#13;
The PIDER program is daily confronted with the complex task of&#13;
"achieving the fit" not just between one "project package" and its&#13;
environment, but between thousands of distinct small projecta and thousands of&#13;
different socioeconomic, cultural, and natural environments. That task could&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
not be entrusted to the planners alone, since very early it became obvious&#13;
that they had failed at it, not having the requisite local knowledge.&#13;
Participation of beneficiaries was the only avenue to pursue - not for just&#13;
political or ideological reasona, but primarily for mere efficiency and for&#13;
reasons of an economic and technical nature. Therefore, against many odds,&#13;
the course was taken in PIDER toward calling for, promoting, postulating, and&#13;
organizing participation.&#13;
Overstatements have often been made in the past about the role played&#13;
by farmers' participation in the first two Bank-assisted PIDER projects. But&#13;
a more down-to-earth approach was taken at the design and appraisal of the&#13;
PIDER III project. There js no doubt that over the last eight years, since&#13;
the PIDER I project started, the promotion and even the institutionalization&#13;
of participation has made certain progreso. This is largely because&#13;
participation in PIDER did not remain simply a topic for trendy exhortations&#13;
but became a genuine concern for carefully elaborating a social technology to&#13;
ensure peasants' actual involvement in the planning and implementation of&#13;
atate-financed development activities. Year after year, this emerging social&#13;
technology has been gradually introduced by the SPP into the planning process&#13;
in new PIDER-covered microregions. During this process, SPP has guided not&#13;
only its own staff but also the staff of other administrative agencies&#13;
contributing to PIDER in reorienting their planning and investment programming&#13;
procedures in a participatory manner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
As a result, the traditional bureaucratic style of these numerous&#13;
technical agencies 11 has started to undergo some changes. These agencies&#13;
were prompted by PIDER to send their staff into the grass-roots, rural&#13;
communities to prepare investment proposals out in the field rather than in a&#13;
desk-bound manner, as in the old bureaucratic routine.&#13;
Since these changes in the style and substance of the process of&#13;
local development investments have to continue, it is important to ascertain&#13;
the experience accumulated from, the potential of, and the likely constraints&#13;
upon, popular participation within the PIDER programa. The present paper,&#13;
therefore, will:&#13;
o    Analyze the very process through which the participatory methodology&#13;
was produced, since this kind of social engineering experiment is&#13;
still very scarce--yet imperiously necessary -- in many ongoing&#13;
development programs&#13;
o    Outline the participatory methodology itself -- its components,&#13;
procedures, and prescriptions for activating the participation of&#13;
communities in investment definition, implementation, and monitoring&#13;
1/ A large number of agencies (technical and administrative, at federal and&#13;
state levela) receive partial financing through PIDER. These agencies&#13;
construct infrastructural assets funded by PIDER or provide services and&#13;
staff for PIDER-financed activities. Among the agencies contributing in&#13;
various degrees to PIDER are: The Secretariat of Agriculture and Water&#13;
Resources and ite subagencies; the Secretariat of Human Settlements and&#13;
Public Works; the Mexican Coffee Institute; the Coconut Promotion Agency&#13;
of Guerrero; the Secretariat of Agrarian Reform; the Department of&#13;
Fisheries; the National Bank for Rural Credit; Bank of Mexico; National&#13;
Fruit Development Commission; Administrative Committee for the Federal&#13;
School Construction Program; Federal Electricity  Commission; Secretariat&#13;
of Public Health and Assistance; the National Company for Popular&#13;
Subsistence; and other various agencies at the state level.&#13;

o    Review PIDER'8 actual experience in introducing and practicing the&#13;
new methodology and in readjusting its bureaucratic structures&#13;
accordingly&#13;
o    Discuss the constraints and limitationa, organizational or societal,&#13;
of community participation in light of the Mexican experience.&#13;
By pointing out the innovativeness of the participatory experience in&#13;
PIDER and by revealing its difficulties, this analysis aims to contribute to a&#13;
consistent application, as well as to the improvement, of the participatory&#13;
approach in the ongoing PIDER programs. At the same time, it will call&#13;
attention to the transfer value for other developing countries of some of the&#13;
experience accumulated in this area in Mexico. The experience reflects&#13;
Mexican conditions and institutional settings and is not to be extrapolated in&#13;
detail, but mutatis mutandis it does offer relevant suggestions with respect&#13;
to the main approaches, principles, and basic processes. Flexible and&#13;
creative learning from this experience would imply adjustments for different&#13;
national contexts and changes, innovations, and adaptations for the local&#13;
customs, institutional structures, and values if genuine participation ja to&#13;
be achieved.&#13;

II. THE PRODUCTION OF A PARTICIPATORY METHODOLOGY&#13;
It is sometimes said that the way to the truth is as important as the&#13;
truth itself. Paraphrasing this old adage, we may say that the process&#13;
through which one arrives at a methodology for participation is no less&#13;
important than the methodology itself.  In the case of PIDER, the very way in&#13;
which the methodology for participation has been worked out is indeed of great&#13;
interest in itself. It suggests valuable lessons, with potential for&#13;
transfer, about the "ingredients" necessary for carrying out a social&#13;
experiment and institutionalizing its products.&#13;
1. A Social Engineering Approach to Participation&#13;
Little knowledge was available at the outset for achieving the&#13;
"ooganized participation of the local population` in investment planning,&#13;
which was PIDER's aim. The very setting of such a goal was a courageous&#13;
social and political development. It was bound to confront not only the lack&#13;
of prior experience but also the opposition of some vested-interest groups or&#13;
the stifling routines of entrenched bureaucratic institutions. Translating&#13;
this goal into practical action was to require a social engineering effort of&#13;
rather long duration, political will and commitment, and sociological&#13;
experimentation, evaluation, and self-correction.&#13;
PIDER embarked on solving this task. In an initial stage, it had&#13;
enlisted the help of CIDER (Centro de Investigacion para el Desarrollo Rural,&#13;
Center for Research on Rural Development), which, besides its evaluation&#13;
functions, was asked to design and test out a "social technology" for&#13;
eliciting sustained popular participation in PIDER.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
A sociological approach was adopted for producing the methodology of&#13;
participatory planning. It was "sociological" in the sense that it was based&#13;
on an analysis of the social forces or groups involved in, or left out from,&#13;
the procese of investment planning and of the political, economic, and&#13;
cultural characteristics of these forces or groups; on a critical social&#13;
analysis of prior experiences with community planning; and on an evaluation of&#13;
the institutions and bureaucratic agencies involved and of the changes they&#13;
would need to go through. It also comprised a sequence of social experiments&#13;
in village communities, under varied but comparable real-life conditions, with&#13;
the proposed methodology: supervised testing and pilot applications of the&#13;
methodology on limited administrative areas of the country; feedback of&#13;
findings into revised procedures; a learning-and-training program for&#13;
educating staff regarding the prerequisites of the new approach; and gradual&#13;
formalization of the evolving methodology into guidelines mandatory for the&#13;
agencies involved in the PIDER program.&#13;
This sociological approach, details of which will follow, is thus in&#13;
itself an experience which has transfer potential to other contexta for which&#13;
a participatory methodology is to be elaborated. Even though the&#13;
circumstances in such other contexts will be different, and the approach would&#13;
have to be modified to fit these circumstances, it is clear that the social&#13;
technology for particípation needs to be designed carefully and to be based on&#13;
previous social analysis and social experimentation, rather than to be&#13;
improvised hastily with more enthusiasm than meticulous social design. This&#13;
sociological approach has required not just "applied social research"--&#13;
understood as "taking the problems as defined by policy makers and translating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
those problemas into research designs" 1/--it has required rather "social&#13;
engineering", wbich could be defined distinctly as using the body of&#13;
sociological knowledge and of investigation techniques for designing policies,&#13;
organization structures, aud action methodologies to accomplish a definite&#13;
social purpose.&#13;
No decree can introduce farmers' participation in the design of&#13;
investment programas overnight. No participatory approach can evolve simply in&#13;
a sanitized executive office, away from the communities for which it is&#13;
destined, and then be imposed top-down. No design of a participatory&#13;
procedure can be perfect and workable from the first attempt. Although this&#13;
would seem self-evident, many rural development projects and programs testify&#13;
to the contrary.  They simply proclaim participation as a goal, assume that&#13;
once proclaimed it will happen, but lamentably fail to make the processual&#13;
3teps for translating this goal into practice.&#13;
The same happened in more than one agricultural development program&#13;
in Mexico before PIDER, and then in the initial stage of the PIDER program as&#13;
well. As Jorge Echenique, who Was involved from the outset in designing&#13;
PIDER's participatory approach, observed correctly,&#13;
There is a tendency for rural development programs, PIDER&#13;
included, to emphasize farmer participation, organization, and&#13;
self-management . . . .   But these goala are never actually&#13;
defined or explained in detail ... As a result, this approach&#13;
often goes no further than the pronouncement stage, and is not&#13;
reflected or put into practice during the course of the&#13;
program. The official agencies, whose inertia is evident,&#13;
mostly act along their old hidebound traditional lines, defining&#13;
wbat is to be done, how it is to be done, and who is to benefit,&#13;
without having any specific knowledge of the real social and&#13;
cultural context in which they are operating. Limited to a&#13;

view of the natural environment and resources, they entertain&#13;
the naive conviction that the aspirations and needs of the rural&#13;
population match their own institutional priorities, and&#13;
continue to dwell in the blissful certainty that the peasants&#13;
know nothing of technology, projects, and serious things of that&#13;
kind. 1/&#13;
The type of participation contemplated by PIDER was intrinsically&#13;
linked to its nature as a rural development program geared to alleviate&#13;
poverty in selected areas of Mexico. Participation was to be promoted in&#13;
determining the priorities for supporting these communities and in enabling&#13;
the poorer strata to share the benefits of development. It was less clear&#13;
which social sub-groups within the target communities (which obviously were&#13;
not homogeneous) had to be motivated to participate. However, given the&#13;
program's overall orientation, the more deprived groups were regarded to be&#13;
those whose active involvement in, and benefit from, development had to be&#13;
stimulated, primarily through increasing their productive capability and their&#13;
productivity.&#13;
Early in PIDER's history it was realized that major problems were&#13;
caused by the inadequacy of the public investment programa. This shortcoming&#13;
was the result of an improper determination of which investmento were most&#13;
needed by the local communities. Therefore, PIDER and CIDER set out to make a&#13;
critical analysis of the traditional way in which investment programming for&#13;
rural communities was being done in Mexico.&#13;
A question frequently asked today, in retrospect, about PIDER's&#13;
participatory effort is: "why was there such a great (almost exclusive)&#13;
emphasis on the initial stage of investing for development -- the programming&#13;
stage?"&#13;
1/ Jorge Echenique, "Notes on Peasant Participation in Rural Development&#13;
Planning," paper prepared for the Sociological Workshop on Participation,&#13;
August 8, 1979 (Washington, D.C: The World Bank; mimeo), p. 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
Although it was recognized that farmer participation was needed in&#13;
all stages (planning, execution, supervision, etc.), PIDER considered that the&#13;
overall success of the development program depended primarily on ensuring&#13;
participation in the initial stage, namely in programming the investments over&#13;
which PIDER had influence. 1/ The programming work to be done included&#13;
establishing the priorities; identifying the project beneficiaries, location,&#13;
and technology; and determining the poesible community contributions in labor&#13;
and resources. Therefore, the procedures for programming investments had to&#13;
be reformed first.&#13;
The traditional investment and programming system for rural&#13;
communities in Mexico was unambiguously top-down: certain authorities or&#13;
agencies first decided to carry out a project and notified the community&#13;
later. This bureaucratic manner had been gradually amended, even before&#13;
PIDER's start, by incorporating into the annual budgets applications submitted&#13;
by communities (either to the Governor or to politicians, during their&#13;
political campaigns and visiting tours) and judged by the authorities to be&#13;
viable technically and economically. Nonetheless, budget items originating in&#13;
local applications were outnumbered by those intróduced by the technical&#13;
experts on the staff of the offical agencies.&#13;
PIDER concluded that the traditional procedures had serious&#13;
drawbacks. First, the true origin of the application was never known: it was&#13;
1/ This consideration can, of course, be debated. One can argue that other&#13;
stages are at least as important as the initial programming stage, or more&#13;
important, in building up a genuine participatory approach. PIDER,&#13;
however, considered this approach to be best at the time. Subsequently,&#13;
as lessons of experíence started to come in, certaín efforts were&#13;
undertaken regarding promoting participation beyond the programming&#13;
phase. These will be discussed later in this paper. In hindsight,&#13;
however, it appears to us that the exclusive concentration on the&#13;
programming stage, while providing the benefits of focus, was a&#13;
self-imposed limitation that adversely affected the overall participation&#13;
drive more than it helped it.&#13;
&#13;

not known whether the original application expressed the interests of&#13;
community or ejido leaders only, of a less powerful group in the community, or&#13;
of most campesinos or ejidatarios. 1/ Second, the usual application was never&#13;
backed up by technical data on which agencies could decide approval or&#13;
rejections and often did not convey the perspective tbat the farmers&#13;
themselves had on the project or activity concerned (location, specific&#13;
beneficiaries, size, etc.).&#13;
In addition, early in the program CIDER and PIDER management realized&#13;
that the technical experto of various sectoral agencies tended automatically&#13;
to adopt (even for PIDER-financed projects) technological models taken out of&#13;
other economic and social contexts, models unsuited to agricultural&#13;
development in the given project areas. It also became apparent that the&#13;
peasanta felt that PIDER works were often badly located and that no attention&#13;
had been paid to the peasants' argumento. These and other similar findings&#13;
reflected a lack of dialogue between the technicians and the farmera during&#13;
the investment planning and selection stage.&#13;
Based on these conclusions, it was decided in 1974 that a new set of&#13;
procedures for identifying priority needs and optimal investments at the&#13;
community level was necessary; this decision vas arrived at through a proceso&#13;
of seeking increased effectiveness and rationality, rather than out of&#13;
ideological or political expediency. PIDER mandated that CIDER&#13;
1/ The term ejido is derived from the Spanish equivalent of the village&#13;
"cormon." In present Mexican law, the ejido is basically a kind of&#13;
cooperative, consisting of a group of families vith joint--and&#13;
inalienable--rights of usufruct to laud. lbs head of such a family is&#13;
called an ejidatario. Ejidos accounted in 1979 for 43%, or 60 million&#13;
hectares, of Mexican farmland. There ¡o *harp socioeconomic&#13;
stratification within the membership of maay ejidos; most productive&#13;
activities are carried out by members individually, but for some others,&#13;
including marketing, there are various forma and degrees of cooperation&#13;
between members.&#13;

start preparing such a methodology. The preparation proceso was expected to&#13;
be not just a desk-bound exercise but an effort in action-research 1/,&#13;
including social experimenta in vivo that would entail going out into the&#13;
villages, activating community initiatives for optimal resource allocation and&#13;
resource maximization, and experimenting with new procedures for planning.&#13;
Thus, the course taken was toward elaborating and empirically testing&#13;
new approaches and procedures, which would be articulated in an overall&#13;
methodology that would replace the top-down imposition of development&#13;
decisione with a system of planning from the bottom up. The articulation of&#13;
this methodology was conceived as a deliberate and sophisticated effort to&#13;
produce a simple operational approach, applicable by managers and farmers in a&#13;
regular manner.&#13;
The recognition that a social methodology ¡s necessary for building&#13;
the "software" of PIDER's development interventions has a significance that&#13;
transcendd the case of PIDER itself. It is worth dwelling on this&#13;
significance. While many technologies are available for the "hardware"&#13;
componente of development projects, this is not the case for the institutional&#13;
components and the sociocultural parts of these projects, which in no way are&#13;
less important for the projects' ultimate succese. Yet methodologies for&#13;
software development are generally not available in a conceptualized and&#13;
operationalized form; development assistance agencies have not joined efforts&#13;
with the social science communities for elaborating them. As it was observed,&#13;
"rarely is the social secientist called on to help an organization build a&#13;
1/ This initiative can probably be also related to the overall emergence and&#13;
expansion of participatory research and action-oriented research in Latin&#13;
America, as G. Falabella described it: "a new encounter between analysis&#13;
and practice".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
capacity to actually use social science knowledge and data in ways that would&#13;
contribute directly to improving performance.` 1/&#13;
The scarcity of such social methodologies for developing the software&#13;
-- in this case, for organizing participation -- leaves the pragmatic and&#13;
operational questions unanswered.2/ This scarcity also leaves plenty of room&#13;
for amateurism, incompetence, and improvisation to creep in; it is frequently&#13;
used as an excuse for neglecting the software, and it accounts for the&#13;
failures of many development interventions.&#13;
11 David C. Korten, "Community Organization and Rural Development: A&#13;
Learning Process Approach," Public Administration Review (September-&#13;
October 1980), p. 501.&#13;
2/ It is precisely these kinds of pragmatic questions, not the philosophical&#13;
ones, that are usually asked by development organizers and agencies.&#13;
Gloria Davis summarized concisely these questions in a symposium that&#13;
discuased farmers' participation in World Bank-assisted projects,&#13;
including PIDER:&#13;
The questions, then, are: How do we increase participation? What&#13;
are the costs? . . . What are the contextual factors which make&#13;
success more or less probable? How do we address problems such as&#13;
class stratification and different class interests within villages?&#13;
How do we link village demando with vertically integrated&#13;
implementing agencies with a divergence of budgets and policies? And&#13;
how do we deal with the development objectives, ideologies, and&#13;
vested interests of borrower Governments? These questions are not an&#13;
argument against a participatory approach, but suggest that what is&#13;
needed is not only the willingness to do participatory projects, but&#13;
a tool kit of concepts and examples on how to proceed . . .  This is&#13;
precisely what social scientists, not to mention laymen, must know to&#13;
determine whether participatory projects are feasible; and how they&#13;
ehould be accomplished. (Promoting Increased Food Production in the&#13;
1980s, Proceedings of the Second Annual Agricultural Sector&#13;
Symposium, January 5-9, 1981; Washington, D.C.: The World Bank, p.&#13;
284).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

PIDER's decision to produce such a methodology was therefore a&#13;
significant departure. It is also part of a recent trend,l/ still timid but&#13;
visibly growing, to recognize the need of and to devote resources for&#13;
preparing social methodologies for tackling the organizational, institutional,&#13;
and cultural dimensiona of development.&#13;
2. The Dance Hall, the Dam, and the Farmers' Perspective&#13;
The intention that guided the elaboration of the participatory&#13;
methodology was to introduce the farmers' perspective into the proceas of&#13;
planning local investments. The difficulty -- and novelty -- was to make the&#13;
planners see development needs and opportunities with "farmers' eyes," rather&#13;
than to let them limit themselves to routine and aloof technical and financial&#13;
assesaments.&#13;
In speaking about "the farmers' perspective" on a given investment or&#13;
activity, the promoters of the participatory approach mean the evaluation that&#13;
the farmers themselves make of a proposed project, having in mind their past&#13;
experiences, their resources, and their current needs. This evaluation often&#13;
differs from the experts' image. The sociological concept underlying the&#13;
recognition of farmers' perspective i8 the principle of self-definition of&#13;
needs. Officials and development planners are not regarded by PIDER as&#13;
1/ Another significant example of this trend is the preparation of social&#13;
methodologies for establishing and strengthening Water Users&#13;
Associations. This í8 a change from the conventional approach in&#13;
developing irrigation systems, which concerned itself only with the&#13;
physical infrastructure of irrigation, and it is visible in irrigation&#13;
projecta in several countries. The most interesting experience to date&#13;
seems to come from the Philippines and was described in detail in Frances&#13;
Korten's study, Building National Capacity to Develop Water Users'&#13;
Associations, World Bank Staff Working Paper No. 528 (Washington, D.C.,&#13;
1982). A similar experience with systematic social engineering efforts ¡s&#13;
reported by Norman Uphoff from the Gal Oya Water Planagenent Project in&#13;
Sri Lanka. Interesting efforts for working out such methodologies were&#13;
also undertaken in Nepal (within the Small Farmer Development Program of&#13;
FAO), in Malawi, and in other countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
necessarily the appointed interpreters or exponente of the farmers'&#13;
interests. The crux of the desired methodology was to get the farmers'&#13;
"angle" on a proposed item of investment and to bring the peasants and the&#13;
experts together for a joint discussion.&#13;
PIDER and CIDER had identified a lack of dialogue and consultation&#13;
between the technicians and the peasants during the programming atage&#13;
regarding their respective images of each project. This absence deprived the&#13;
planner and technician of both information about and identification with the&#13;
interests of the beneficiary peasants. As one of the contributors to the&#13;
participatory methodology put it,&#13;
The peasant knows the land and water situation in his locality, a&#13;
knowledge that is passed on from generation to generation. He knows&#13;
the extent of his own technology and the means of production&#13;
available to him. He knows the physical and economic results of his&#13;
past activities. He identifies many of the causes of his failures&#13;
and of his lack of progreso and has his own special view of his&#13;
development needs and plano. This is the basic raw material for the&#13;
programming expert and the cement holding the development projects&#13;
together. To work without this kind of information is like&#13;
programning in a vacuum. 1/&#13;
The sad story of a village diversion dam in Baja California Norte ja&#13;
a telling example in this respect. Several days of torrential rains&#13;
completely destroyed the "El Chocolate" dam, and the floodwaters swept away&#13;
the structures of many irrigation wells. A large area of fruit tree&#13;
plantationa, some of which were PIDER investments, was also destroyed. The&#13;
experto who had been responsible for constructing the dam told the CIDER team&#13;
preparing the new methodology that the dam's collapse was an act of fate, that&#13;
they had consulted the only hydrometric series available for rainfall and&#13;
surface run-offs (for the last fifteen years), and that they had designed the&#13;
project based on existing information -- without allowing for the possibility&#13;
1/  Ecbenique, "Noto  oo Peaaut Participation," p. 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
that rains heavier than the maximum recorded in the series might fall. The&#13;
same CIDER team asked the rural inhabitanta as well. Their opinion about the&#13;
dam's collapse was different--namely, that the experto had not paid any&#13;
attention to the villagers' experience. The oldest among them clearly&#13;
remembered that thirty yeare earlier it had rained solidly for two days in the&#13;
region, and that the atream on which the dam had been built had risen to a&#13;
level of 5 meters (the experta had calculated a maximum of 3 metera). 1/&#13;
The farmers' perspective "sees" aspecta which the experts might not&#13;
perceive, as suggested by another example. During a conventional&#13;
investment programming exercise, technical planning staff mockingly rejected a&#13;
"crazy" written request from a víllage where the farmera proposed that a dance&#13;
hall be constructed. Out of curiosity, a CIDER tea. decided to visit the&#13;
ejido that had proposed that unsuitable expenditure. It found that many of&#13;
the farmera in that village were musiciana, and that their reputation was so&#13;
good that on Sundays and holidays rural inhabitants from the surrounding area&#13;
came to dance on improvised, open-air grounds.  Most of the ejido members felt&#13;
that a dance hall would be the best means of attracting more visitors, of&#13;
selling local producta, and thus of bringing in money and generating&#13;
employment. In termo of rural development, as the team commented afterwarda,&#13;
've wondered wbether the application for a dance hall was not more justifiable&#13;
than many of the 'white elephants' included by the experta in PIDER&#13;
programming.'&#13;
Thus, striving for "the farmers' perspective" was the engine powering&#13;
the entire desagn and testing of the participatory methodology.&#13;
1/  Similar cases of "peasant engineering wisdom" have been reported from the&#13;
Philippines (the dam at Laur) aud Nepal. Both dama collapsed; the&#13;
circumstances of engineers' ignoring farmers' knowledge, and the outcomes,&#13;
were almost ídentical. (See papers by F. Korten aud U. Uphoff, referred&#13;
to in the bibliography.)&#13;

3. The Experiment: Designing-Testing-Learning-Revising&#13;
In designing the set of participatory programming procedures, the&#13;
working group of researchers, planners, and administrators set up by CIDER and&#13;
PIDER was given the opportunity to do what more recently has been called&#13;
"action research" -- namely, to try out the devised procedures during actual&#13;
planning operations in several microregions.&#13;
The preparation of the participatory methodology was carried out as a&#13;
major social experiment. Since the same individuals did both the design and&#13;
the implementing of the new procedures, they were able to avoid the trappings&#13;
of a purist academic or utopian social experiment, to learn from real field&#13;
difficulties, and to increase the practicality of the proposed methodology.&#13;
The central CIDER-PIDER working group 1/ helped establish several local&#13;
multidisciplinary teams (consisting of sociologists, economists, planners, and&#13;
technical experts) that embarked on performing this genuine "social&#13;
engineering" task in various microregions. The researchers were thus put in&#13;
the propitious position of reaching a multiplier effect by providing the&#13;
personnel of the action agencies with tools for their own profession--&#13;
planning.&#13;
The multidisciplinary teams went out to villages in different&#13;
regions, studied past and current forms of (and constraints on) village&#13;
involvement, assessed local needs and potential, and considered various&#13;
options for the new approach. The experiment was informed by a sociological&#13;
understanding of the political and cultural factors at work in the Mexican&#13;
peasant society, of the social and economic analysis of the peasant&#13;
1/ This '"working group" included a mix of professional skills: social&#13;
anthropology, economics, sociology, agronomy. The core members of the&#13;
team were:  J. Echenique, Marcos Arellanos, Víctor Chagoya, Antonio&#13;
Monzon, Alfonso Cano.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
population, of the power systems operating in the society at large, and of the&#13;
institutional context within which planning and participatíon had to be&#13;
carried out.&#13;
This experimental approach to designing a social technology for&#13;
participation has provided an enormous comparative advantage over other&#13;
attempts previously undertaken in Mexico, attempts which had drowned in noisy&#13;
but impractical rhetoric. Political scientists and sociologists who have&#13;
studied participation approaches in different countries correctly observed&#13;
that `participation is often endorsed unambiguously on normative grounds even&#13;
if the empirical basis is not clear. A real danger is that with growing&#13;
faddishness and a lot of líp service, participation could become drained of&#13;
substance and its relevance to development programs disputable." 1/ In-&#13;
contrast with this observation, Mexico's PIDER was not drained of `substance&#13;
and relevance" precisely because of a pragmatic, nuts-and-bolts type of&#13;
approach. Participation was regarded as a matter of social engineering for&#13;
establishing a modified set of social and power relationships between the&#13;
"actors" of the planning procesa: professional planners and technicians, the&#13;
beneficiary population, and the concerned agencies and institutions.&#13;
Table 1 summarízes the main moments and stages of the lengthy social&#13;
learning process through which the elaboration of the participatory&#13;
methodology has gone, from the beginning to what the methodology is now.&#13;
Decoding this table, one grasps the image of an incessant "dialogue"&#13;
between: (a) work at the drawing board; (b) field testing; and (c) actual&#13;
application. In fact, the back-and-forth cycle was even longer than the table&#13;
suggests: from design to field testing, from testing back to the drawing&#13;

board, then again to testing in the field and redesigning, then on to training&#13;
of staff to apply the new design on a larger scale. And so the back-and-forth&#13;
process continued creatively.&#13;
The social experiment was difficult and complex. Different lessons&#13;
were derived from microregions with different social settings and different&#13;
institutions. Messages from the field tests were often contradictory and&#13;
unclear. New tests were necessary. The successfully tested principles had to&#13;
be solidified in clear prescriptions, while the areas of uncertainty had to&#13;
be narrowed down gradually. Also, together with firm normative prescriptions,&#13;
overall flexibility had to be built in, to allow room for local differences in&#13;
applying the guidelines. The entire sequence was a social learning process 1/&#13;
for developing an approach out of lessons from experience. Training took on&#13;
an increasing importance as the emerging methodology had to be explained and&#13;
disseminated to larger numbers of staff for application in new geographical&#13;
areas.&#13;
As it is visible from Table 1, the design of the participatory&#13;
methodology started 2/ in August 1975, and its practical testing began in the&#13;
1/ See extended discussion of the significance for development of a "learning&#13;
process approach" in Korten, "Community Organization."&#13;
2/ Table 1 reflects in its chronology both the continuities and&#13;
discontinuities of the social engineering and learning process described.&#13;
To understand the table better, one should know that the period of 1980&#13;
(second half) and 1981 was a time of important administrative changes in&#13;
SPP/PIDER that also affected the institutional arrangements for promoting&#13;
participation. Major decisions to decentralize PIDER were made in 1981,&#13;
and they entailed strengthening of SPP/PIDER staff at state level,&#13;
including more specific responsibilities for organizing participation and&#13;
creation of several new "support`' departments in SPP headquarters to&#13;
assist the participation promotion programs carried out at state level.&#13;
Also in 1981, CIDER ceased to be involved in the further refinement or&#13;
application of the participatory methodology. Thus, while the pre-1981&#13;
experience was further carried out in the new organizational setting with&#13;
a good degree of continuity, there were also obvious interruptions that&#13;
caused losses of momentum and of accumulated lessons (see further Chapter&#13;
II, sections 4 and 5, and Chapter VII, Section 2).&#13;

Mazahua microregion (Mexico State) in fall 1975.  The procesa involved&#13;
meetings at the community level, village diagnostic assessments, and other&#13;
procedures that will be explained later in this paper (see Chapter IV). With&#13;
some corrections, the initial programming design continued to be tested during&#13;
the first quarter of 1976 in a larger area consisting of eight micro-&#13;
regions. 1/ These tests were carried out either as the original programming&#13;
of investments for a given microregion or as part of the annual exercise for&#13;
reprogramming allocations made previously.&#13;
Based on the experiments, the first guidelines were drastically&#13;
modifíed, and a more down-to-earth document was prepared. 2/ At that point,&#13;
and at PIDER's request, CIDER also organized a training program to start&#13;
educating PIDER personnel at large about the principles and procedures of the&#13;
emerging participatory methodology.&#13;
Following two more rounds of testing and refinement of the&#13;
participation-eliciting methodology -- in 1976 in South Yucatan, Hecelchacan,&#13;
and other microregions, and in 1977 in the Western and Eastern Morelos&#13;
microregions -- new recommendations were readied and applied in early 1978&#13;
through actual planning exercíses on limited areas. The difference between&#13;
simply "testing" and "application" was that the latter was done as part of the&#13;
1/ Tejupilco (Mexico State), East Morelos (Morelos State), Ensenada (Northern&#13;
Baja California), and Chol, Cintapala, Zoque, Lacandona, and Bellavista&#13;
(Chiapas).&#13;
2/ It is not the purpose of the present chapter to reconstruct and describe&#13;
each one of these initial or intermediate methodologies, which were&#13;
provisional when they were drafted and therefore needed a succession of&#13;
revisions. Rather, the intent is to emphasize the processuality of&#13;
working out a methodology through trial and error, through iterative&#13;
approximations and sequences of refinements. Of course, the paper will&#13;
further describe in detail (Chapters III, IV, and V) the content of what&#13;
was arrived at as (more or les8) the "final" methodology for participation&#13;
(although such a methodology, in our view, should never be "frozen" and&#13;
regarded as unchangeable and nonperfectable).&#13;

the investment plan. Not only CIDER/PIDER staff, but virtually all the other&#13;
relevant line and technical agencies were involved. The participatory&#13;
methodology emerging from these repeated rounds thus was not just the output&#13;
of a few imaginative minds, but the result of confronting the issues in&#13;
practice and of repeated fine tunings at the drawing board.&#13;
During the designing, testing, and refining of these procedures,&#13;
PIDER and CIDER continuously stressed the linkage between the two sides of the&#13;
planning process: the sociological and the technical sides of planning.&#13;
Participatory planning was intended to mean more than collecting a "shopping&#13;
bag" of community proposals and accepting them without sound review.&#13;
Understanding the sociology of the given community, its power and economic&#13;
structures, was important but not enough. The "social engineers" of the&#13;
participatory approach soon learned that a careful technical-economic scrutiny&#13;
and justifícation of each proposal was also required. "Social engineering"&#13;
had to go hand in hand with, and not substitute for, the "technical&#13;
engineering` and financial soundness analysis.&#13;
This awareness led to a significant correction: part of the efforts&#13;
for producing a methodology were redirected toward the production of several&#13;
new analytical instrumento -- which were, in a way, `by-products" of the&#13;
participatory methodology -- for etringently assessing the technical and&#13;
economic soundness of local investment proposale. 1/ These were necessary&#13;
1/ The simultaneity in preparing both types of "instruments" -- social and&#13;
technicoeconomic--was in fact an adequate response to two fallacies often&#13;
present in the argumento in favor or against participation--the "populist"&#13;
fallacy and the "paternalistií" fallacy. As has been correctly argued,&#13;
the populist fallacy that the rural majority always "knows better" than&#13;
the technical personnel and has sufficient skills to bring about&#13;
development by itself ¡s as erroneous as the paternalistic fallacy that&#13;
the bureaucracy knows best and can do alone all that is needed for&#13;
development (see Norman Uphoff and Milton Esman, Local Organization for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
because often the proposals emerging from communities contained nothing more&#13;
than an attractive idea, without back-up technical information and economic&#13;
justification. Therefore, PIDER has gradually developed instruments and&#13;
standard forms for the technical formulation and economic justification of&#13;
grass-roots proposed projects, standard checklists for investment analysis,&#13;
identification guidelines for assessing the engineering requirements of&#13;
projects, etc. The use of these instruments helped enhance the quality and&#13;
soundness of microproject preparation, particularly the economic and technical&#13;
preparation, and standardized the investment feasibility assessments across&#13;
microregions.&#13;
Another "correction" of the overall approach was the increasing&#13;
recognition given to the need for promoting participation in the&#13;
implementation and monitoring of the community works financed by PIDER, as&#13;
well as in the operation of completed community projects. This correction was&#13;
triggered by the 1978 mid-term evaluation of the PIDER 1 project, which&#13;
uncovered, inter alia, many disastrous cases of waste of resources. These, it&#13;
was felt, could have been prevented or mitigated through consistent&#13;
involvement of beneficiaries in the execution of the local projects and in the&#13;
monitoring and control of the quality of works performed by private&#13;
contractors and technical agencies financed by PIDER. 1/ Unfortunately, a&#13;
full-fledged effort to prepare a methodology for participation in project&#13;

execution and monitoring (as had been done earlier for programming) was not&#13;
initiated immediately after the mid-term evaluation. However, the new&#13;
understanding did stimulate some attempts to work out solutions for these&#13;
stages, too, which produced some results three to four years later.&#13;
A further stage in elaborating the participatory programming&#13;
methodology was the decision to apply it, for the first time in 1979, to an&#13;
entire state -- Zacatecas -- for preparing the overall state investment plan.&#13;
The challenges involved in this effort (compared with applying the new&#13;
procedures only in selected microregions) as well as the staff resources&#13;
required were of a different magnitude than any prior testing (more details&#13;
are given in Chapter V). Altogether, diagnostic work at the grass-roots level&#13;
was carried out in over 1,050 village communities in Zacatecas, and about 200&#13;
staff of different agencies were involved. The state plan was thus a result&#13;
of using the participatory methodology across the board. Subsequently, when&#13;
the PIDER III project was appraised in 1980, it incorporated financing of the&#13;
investment plans for two of the Zacatecas microregiona, as designed through&#13;
this first full-scale participatory planning exercise.&#13;
Thus, by the start of the PIDER III project the proceso of designing-&#13;
testing-learning-revising was virtually completed, in the sense that essential&#13;
lessons were already accumulated and that the participatory programming&#13;
methodology had already become an instrument reliable enough for widespread&#13;
application.&#13;
4.  Formalizing Organizational Norms for Participation&#13;
The time had thus come, by the beginning of 1980, to move ahead from&#13;
experimenting to institutionalizing, from testing approaches to prescribing&#13;
procedures. In other words, the experience accumulated and the several&#13;
generations of draft guidelines had to be synthesized into a formal&#13;
methodology wíth normative authoríty for mandatory application in PIDER.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
This happened with the issuance, early in 1980, of a SPP Manual for&#13;
Programming 1/ containing the strategy and the detailed procedures that had&#13;
emerged from the previous several years of testing. This Manual was made "the&#13;
norm" for immediately programming PIDER III areas. Numerous training seminars&#13;
were organized for staff at various levels and in different regions to&#13;
familiarize them with the Manual. The four states (Sinaloa, Guerrero,&#13;
Zacatecas, and Yucatan), with seventeen microregions to be covered under the&#13;
PIDER III project, were reguired to use the methodology prescribed by the&#13;
Manual. They did so for the first eight microregions later in 1980 and in&#13;
early 1981. In a sense, this was to be the "final" methodology for&#13;
participatory programming: not in that it was seen as "frozen" and closed to&#13;
further improvements, but in that it was regarded as an instrument perfected&#13;
enough to be introduced as the formal norm throughout the entire PIDER.&#13;
The path toward this "final" methodology was not a smooth one.&#13;
Besides the difficulties inherent in the mechanics of testing, there were&#13;
institutional obstacles to overcome as well. At various levels in one or&#13;
another agency, the bureaucracy reacted with a mix of support and reluctance,&#13;
sometimes opposing the new approach openly, other times paying it lip service&#13;
while in practice sidestepping it.&#13;
Even within PIDER, the acceptance by staff and managers evolved only&#13;
gradually. In fact, at every stage that a new, revised methodology was&#13;
readied, it had to be cleared formally before further application. Whíle&#13;
those responsible for testing and fine-tuning the methodology were basically a&#13;
group of social researchers, those who had to approve and enforce its&#13;
implementation were managers and administratora. The views of these two&#13;

para el desarrollo rural" (Mexico, D.F.: SPP, Direccion General de&#13;
Programacion Regional, and CIDER, January 1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
groups did clash sometimes. The managers often felt pressed by time and&#13;
execution deadlines; they were concerned that the application of the&#13;
participatory model might lengthen the planning process or might entail&#13;
excessive costs and staff resources. Various management teams that succeeded&#13;
each other at the helm of PIDER over the years were not equally convinced that&#13;
the improvements resulting from the participatory procedure would justify the&#13;
greater efforts involved in planning. In turn, various líne agencies at the&#13;
local level did indeed recognize in principle that a participatory methodology&#13;
was needed, but this did not necessarily mean they received the proposed&#13;
procedures with open arms.&#13;
The sociologists and economists involved in changing the new&#13;
metbodology derived strength during this process from their increasing&#13;
immersion in the technical and social-change practicalities of investment&#13;
identification and planning, as well as from the ultimate support given by&#13;
SPP/PIDER's senior management. This support and commitment was instrumental&#13;
in keeping the social experiment going and in triggering some reorientation&#13;
within the line agencies as well.&#13;
5. Staff for Implementing the New Methodology&#13;
The production proceso of a social methodology is not complete&#13;
without a mechanism and the resources able to implement it. It is generally&#13;
difficult to assume that a new approach can simply be superimposed over the&#13;
existing administratíve-bureaucratic organization to make the latter function&#13;
differently. Reorganization is required in one degree or another, implying:&#13;
(a) reallocation of staff resources; (b) redefinition of functions and&#13;
responsibilities; (c) rearrangements of linkages between different units of&#13;
the administration, thus to establish the mechanism and the apparatus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
necessary for carrying out the methodology. Otherwise, a new methodology&#13;
would remain a simple utopian notion, while business as usual would continue.&#13;
Such major reorganizations have happened in SPP and PIDER during the&#13;
period from end-1980 to the beginning of 1983. Only some of them were related&#13;
to the implementation of the participatory methodology; political reasons&#13;
contributed to triggering others. 1/ We will discuss here only those relevant&#13;
to setting up the mechanism for participation. These refer to organizational&#13;
decentralization and rearrangement at both federal and state levels and to&#13;
inethodological developments in the community-involvement techniques.&#13;
organizationally, the decentralization process launched when the&#13;
PIDER III project was about to begin in 1981 was propitious for strengthening&#13;
the participatory orientation. This decentralization was a necessary&#13;
complement to promoting participation at the lowest level, since maintaining&#13;
tight central management control upon each microregion in PIDER was no longer&#13;
consonant with progreas in vesting expanded rights in the local communities.&#13;
Increased authority was assigned to state governments. A devolution of&#13;
federal authority for the planning, implementation, and monitoring of&#13;
centrally funded rural development programs was effected to the state level.&#13;
In February 1981, an Agreement was signed between SPP and State Governors for&#13;
transferring a set of central PIDER responsibilities to state governments.&#13;
This process of decentralization of authority is specially significant in the&#13;
1/  There were, in fact, two "waves" of changes:  one in 1981, consisting of a&#13;
substantial decentralization of PIDER, which was related to clear&#13;
political reasons, as well as to the nature of the program itself and to&#13;
the need to bring its management closer to the investment and development&#13;
process at the community-microregional level; the second, by&#13;
end-1982/beginning-1983, was the reorganization of the SPP itself in the&#13;
aftermath of Mexico's presidential elections. The ways in which the 1983&#13;
changes will affect participation will have to be ass  ed over the next&#13;
few years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Mexican context, in which the federal government is extremely strong and in&#13;
which federal funding has until recently been synonymous with central&#13;
planning. 1/&#13;
The mechanism instituted through decentralization for carrying out&#13;
PIDER with increasing involvement of beneficiaries called for: (a) the&#13;
establishment in each state of a State Committee for Rural Development; (b)&#13;
the establishment of Subregional Rural Development Committees for each one of&#13;
the PIDER microregions (with both subregional and state committees to include&#13;
representatives of the implementing agencies and of the beneficiaries'&#13;
communities); (c) the assignment of additional staff resources to act as&#13;
"'support groups" (Grupos de Apoyo) for informing communities on PIDER, for&#13;
making socioeconomic analyses and diagnostic assessaments on project&#13;
communities through direct work with the population of these communities, and&#13;
for assisting in the formulation and technical-economic preparation of&#13;
1/ In the 1970s, during the PIDER 1 and II projects, SPP staff assigned to&#13;
PIDER used to have the responsibility for planning the investment package&#13;
for each microregion; each executing agency was then requested to&#13;
construct those works which fell under its purview and was provided with&#13;
PIDER investment funds. The state governments in Mexico's thirty-one&#13;
atates exercised a rather symbolic function. Starting with 1981, however,&#13;
the situation was reversed, and state governments were given authority and&#13;
responsibility for the programming, budgeting, and coordination of the&#13;
microregional PIDER investment programs. Central SPP staff retained only&#13;
guiding, support, and broad monitoring functions. This decentralization&#13;
was also intended to enhance the states' capability for multiyear&#13;
investment programming to improve the technical quality of project&#13;
preparation; to give funds and rights to the states for executing works&#13;
themselves with local agencies, and not only through the central technical&#13;
agencies; and to shoulder the strategy of involving beneficiaries in&#13;
planning. According to the new system, state governments prepare (and&#13;
coordinate) medium-term investment plans for three- or four-year periodo,&#13;
based on priority needs which have to be identified at the community&#13;
level. Revisions and detailed specifications of actual investments are to&#13;
be done each year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
identified projects at community level. 1/ This represented a significant&#13;
step in institution building for participatory development and a substantial&#13;
beefing-up of staff resources mandated to interact directly with the local&#13;
communities.&#13;
At the same time, another interesting development happened in SPP&#13;
itself. While essential functions were devolved from the center to the&#13;
periphery, SPP considered it necessary to set up a more elaborate structure&#13;
for providing methodological support and assistance to the states in&#13;
implementing their new responsibilities. Four such support programs were&#13;
established and staffed in SPP headquarters:&#13;
o    The program for supportíng participation of rural communities (PAPCO)&#13;
o    The program for socioeconomic analysis of the rural community&#13;
o    The program for supporting the formulation of productive projects&#13;
o    The program for monitoring, execution control, and evaluation of&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
These four central programs were mandated to carry on the effort for&#13;
developing methodologies, guidelines, and manuals for their specific areas, to&#13;
be used in all states. At the same time (1981), CIDER was phased out from&#13;
working on the participation methodology for PIDER (in hindsight, this appears&#13;
to have been a premature decision).&#13;
1/ The average staff ratios assigned to these Grupos de Apoyo for work with&#13;
rural conmunities are:  two staff per microregion for the socioeconomic&#13;
analysis of communities; two staff for three microregions for information&#13;
and motivation activities among beneficiary communities; two staff per&#13;
microregion for monitoring and evaluation, in conjunction with community&#13;
representatives, of investment implelTentation; and ten technical staff per&#13;
state for the technical preparation of projects, in conjunction with&#13;
technicians belonging to the line agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
These four programs were reconfirmed during the recent (1983)&#13;
reorganization of SPP following the presidential election in Mexico.1/ The&#13;
intention is, in fact, to expand their methodological support to other&#13;
development programs besides PIDER. (Organizational charts of the 1983&#13;
structure of SPP and PIDER Directorate in which these programs are located are&#13;
given in Annexes III-IV.)&#13;
The institutionalization of these methodological concerns in&#13;
SPP/PIDER headquarters has provided additional structure and focus. In short&#13;
time, a flurry of "Lineamentos Metodologicos" (methodological guidelines) and&#13;
"Manuales" were prepared and issued, elaborating further on the "how-to"&#13;
aspects of the social technology for community participation.&#13;
Particularly interesting is the "Manual for the Support Program for&#13;
Rural Community Participation" ("Manual del programa de apoyo a la&#13;
participacion de la comunidad rural"; the program is abbreviated as&#13;
PAPCO). 2/ This Manual sets forth the strategy for "information and&#13;
motivation" -- in other words, the approach to explaining to communities and&#13;
agency staff the objectives and investment means of PIDER.&#13;
At almost the same time, two other Manuals were prepared and&#13;
published on the socioeconomic analysis of communities 3/ and on the&#13;

(SPP)," in Diario Official Mexico, D.F.: March 25, 1983).&#13;

formulation of productive projects for local communities. 1/ Also, a revised&#13;
manual on procedures for programming and budgeting 21 in PIDER was issued in&#13;
July 1982, summarizing both the justification of the participatory approach&#13;
and the procedures for carrying it out.&#13;
Before the 1982 year was over, two other manuals on monitoring&#13;
project execution control were also put out; 3/ each one, in varying degree,&#13;
specified ways in which the communities could and should be involved not just&#13;
in identifying programming investments, but aleo in project implementation and&#13;
monitoring.&#13;
In summary, the procesa of producing a methodology for community&#13;
participation in investment programming has continued in PIDER from 1975 up to&#13;
date. The years 1981-83, building upon previous efforts and experience8, have&#13;
seen an extension of the previous concerne from programming to other forme of&#13;
participation, and have established organizational and staffing instruments in&#13;
support of the social methodology that has evolved. In the process, prior&#13;
errors are being corrected. The institutional memory of PIDER has been&#13;
crystalized in guidelines and manuals, although a significant part of this&#13;
experience has been lost with the frequent changes in staff and managers. The&#13;
recent proliferation of manuals may be something of an exaggeration, but in&#13;
essence it is a positive development. The content of this methodology will be&#13;
examined in substance in Chapters III to V.&#13;

6. Lessons of Social Engineering&#13;
Some lessons can be derived, summarizing the examination made so far,&#13;
about why the social engineering approach for participators was embraced and&#13;
about how the laborious learning processes through which PIDER went have&#13;
progressed and resulted in a tangible, structural, pragmatic methodology for&#13;
participation. These lessons are instructive for any efforts to build up&#13;
propitious circumstances for favorable social engineering elsewhere and to&#13;
replicate an effective path of social engineering.&#13;
First, there was a set of facilitating circumstances that proved&#13;
crucial for setting the climate and taking the organizational road toward&#13;
working out a participatory methodology. Among such circumstances, we count:&#13;
(a) awareness of failure, meaníng the unmitigated recognition of the&#13;
ineffectiveness of prior programming procedures; (b) consensus on need for&#13;
change; (e) setting up of a multidisciplinary working group, with a shared&#13;
value system, favoring participation; (d) support from the top echelons of the&#13;
government agency (SPP); (e) willingness to experiment out in the field, to&#13;
make mistakes, and to learn from them; (f) recognition that innovative social&#13;
engineering needs time, needs a patient "laboratory" (field time) before being&#13;
ready for generalization on a large scale.&#13;
Second, the lessons derivable from the social engineering process&#13;
through which the new model has been produced point to the following gains in&#13;
know-how:&#13;
o    Elaborating such a social methodology requires the multidisciplinary&#13;
skills of professional social researchers and development&#13;
practitioners; only jointly can they design for "software" and build&#13;
up the capacity of development agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
o    Social engineering involves real-life social experiments, as opposed&#13;
to ivory-tower concoction of schemes; the model for participation of&#13;
project beneficiaries is not simply a brainchild, it is a pattern of&#13;
social organization for development action. Establishing such a&#13;
pattern requires patient set-up and observation of these experiments,&#13;
learning from errors, and repeated returns to the drawing board.&#13;
o    Training is critical in social engineering because even partial,&#13;
mid-way results have to be communicated to, and learned by, the&#13;
client audience; not least, ongoing training builds up the&#13;
constituency and receptivity for the products of the social&#13;
engineering effort.&#13;
o    Sustained political commitment in support of the social engineering&#13;
approach is necessary for going the distance and fighting off the&#13;
entrenched bureaucratic and vested-interest obstacles.&#13;
o    Transition from experiments with, to normative institutionalization&#13;
of, participation has to be made at the right time.&#13;
o    New staffing and organizational rearrangements follow necessarily&#13;
from social engineering; no new methodology can be effective, viable,&#13;
and sustainable without them.&#13;

III. TRE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR PARTICIPATION IN PIDER&#13;
This is the first of three chapters describing and analyzing what the&#13;
participatory methodology -- produced through the social engineering and&#13;
learning efforts described before -- consists of. This chapter summarizes the&#13;
conceptual framework of PIDER'S participatory approach; 1/ Chapter IV will&#13;
present the participation methodology in programming; and Chapter V will&#13;
examine participation procedures in project implementation and in monitoring.&#13;
1. A Means, Not an End&#13;
While some overpragmatic planners tend to dismiss the conceptual&#13;
framework as simple rhetoric or unnecessary theory, it is a fact that without&#13;
the clarifying role of some concepts no participatory mechanism could have&#13;
been articulated or can be implemented.&#13;
The conceptual framework, or the "philosophy" which guides and&#13;
expresses PIDER's orientation toward participatory investment planning,&#13;
formulates what is popular participation and why it is necessary at the local&#13;
level. These concepts have evolved during the years, and they artículate the&#13;
reasons for which PIDER pursues participation.&#13;
The function of involving beneficiaries'participation in PIDER was&#13;
defined as&#13;
getting members of rural communities covered by PIDER to participate&#13;
actively and responsibly in analyzing their problema, identifying&#13;
solutions based on their knowledge and available natural, human and&#13;
capital resources, and taking decisions on accomplishing their&#13;
development. 1/&#13;

1982 (see biblíography).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Community development ¡8 regarded in PIDER as resulting from&#13;
combining the efforts of the community ítself with the work of government&#13;
agencies at all levela: municipal, state, and federal. The participatory&#13;
methodology is designed to mobilize latent local resources more successfully&#13;
than is done (if at all) by bureaucratic planning and to avoid unilateral&#13;
decisions (and entailed errors) made by the agencies' technical staff without&#13;
consulting community members or local authorities.  Thus, PIDER points out&#13;
that promoting community involvement is not an end in itself: it is&#13;
essentially a means, along with other components of the program, for&#13;
mobilizing local resources to achieve development. With local involvement,&#13;
program activities cease to be external initiatives and become projects that&#13;
are undertaken by the community and are incorporated into the life of the&#13;
community as part of its own achievements. In addition, community cooperation&#13;
in building infrastructure is important because it enables public funds to go&#13;
a longer way and to benefit a larger number of people.&#13;
The sociological understanding of participation which underlies the&#13;
operational planning procedures was conceptualized by CIDER/PIDER as a set of&#13;
basic principles: self-definition of interests; community diagnosis; phased&#13;
approach; regional integration; interagency cooperation, and consistency of&#13;
objectives. Each of these will be explained briefly below.&#13;
2. Self-definition of Interests&#13;
The basic interests of the peasants should be reflected in the&#13;
development plan. Recognizing the peasants' own definition of their interests&#13;
is crucial for securing their participation. Therefore, the individual&#13;
activities to be incorporated in each regional program must develop from&#13;
proposals put forward by the local peasant populations themselves. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
particular development strategy for a given region must stem from the&#13;
perception the peasants have of their felt needs 1/ and of their development&#13;
possibilities.&#13;
Expert knowledge for identifying development potential is&#13;
indispensable, but development cannot be planned exclusively on the basis of&#13;
studies or ideas put forward by technical or economic agencies or by PIDER's&#13;
own staff. To do so would be to impose a perspective on the communities that&#13;
would conflict with the way community members see their own future.&#13;
PIDER programning guidelines take the position that officials do not&#13;
automatically have a better perspective of peasants' problems and best&#13;
interests than peasants have themselves. The development plan should reflect&#13;
what the subgroups of each community perceive and request as support from the&#13;
appropriate agencies. When the peasant groups do not have a clear perspective&#13;
of their interests or possibilities, the experts and officials fulfill their&#13;
role as agents of change by assisting the peasant population in becoming more&#13;
aware and ínformed of what the technical options for development are. But&#13;
participation implies that peasants themselves develop a definition of their&#13;
interests and wants, without which they would not act.&#13;
3.  Community Diagnosis&#13;
The rural communíty is regarded as the basic unit for programming&#13;
investments. Therefore, an assessment (or diagnosis) of each community needs&#13;
to be undertaken. Peasant communites, however, are not homogeneous entities.&#13;
1/ The concept of "felt needs" is, of course, crucial for a priority ranking&#13;
of local investments. The key question is "who" feels these needs. An&#13;
interesting sociological discussion of this concept is contained in&#13;
Gelia T. Castillo, "How Participatory is Participatory Development: Some&#13;
Lessons from the Philippine Experience" (1981), mimeo.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

They do not have only one set of interests. It would be a mistake to believe&#13;
that such an assessment can be made simply by listening to a few community&#13;
leaders, or by regarding the investment proposals that come up first as&#13;
necessarily representing the interests of the entire community.&#13;
Fostering participation requires that a sociological assessment of&#13;
village stratification and socioeconomic structure be made. Not all of the&#13;
village subgroups express their concerns with equal forcefulness, and&#13;
relatively few express them distinctly. Fear of speaking up -- and the social&#13;
inhibitions of women and young people and of groups traditionally neglected by&#13;
investment policies (such as landless laborers, ethnic minorities, or the&#13;
smallest farmers) -- are serious constrainta. Cultural traditions often tend&#13;
to prevent women from expressing their views on general community issues,&#13;
despite their multiple roles in the household and village economy.&#13;
Community diagnoses should therefore be carried out with the&#13;
understanding that participation calls for information and organization, for a&#13;
commitment by the whole of the peasant population. It calls for reflection, a&#13;
knowledge of available resources and of development possibilities, a conscious&#13;
priority ranking of needs, and a sequential ordering of the works and services&#13;
that will be required of the program. It calls for time--time to promote,&#13;
develop, and harvest this collective thinking, and it calls for technicians&#13;
capable of participating in this exercise without imposing their own ideas,&#13;
without believing they know everything, and without having any ax to grind.&#13;
4. Regional Integration&#13;
The developing communities are not isolated entities. The&#13;
microregional plan should not be a mechanical aggregate of programs for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
individual communities but rather the expression of the development strategy&#13;
for a set of communities. In other words, participatory programming should&#13;
reconcile local priorities with the overall strategy.&#13;
There are several sociological and economic reasons for this&#13;
integrative approach. Communities in the PIDER microregions may be linked to&#13;
the same development center and may have similar ecology, natural resources,&#13;
and socioeconomic production structures. They may share a common road network&#13;
and may have common cultural roots. It is essential in these cases to&#13;
formulate an integrated strategy for the development of the entire set of&#13;
communities.  Furthermore, certain works and services will necessarily have to&#13;
cover a number of neighboring localities.  For example, the Uniones de Ejidos&#13;
conduct integrated activities at the regional level in connection with&#13;
marketing, credit, agricultural machinery, and so on. Integrated planning&#13;
should therefore be adapted to the existing social and ecological systems and&#13;
organizations.&#13;
5. Iterative Planning for the Ultimate Objectives&#13;
The selection of the target localities and the identífication of&#13;
potential beneficiaries of the program within each locality should be&#13;
consistent with the ultimate objectives of the program: that is, to ensure&#13;
that the recipients of the benefits are those peasant groups that are most&#13;
backward in resources and development possibilities.&#13;
The planning decisions about what to do, where to do it and who the&#13;
beneficiaries should be must be geared to increasing the production&#13;
capability, the employment opportunities, and the incomes of the most deprived&#13;
peasant groups. This planning may require more than one attempt to arrive at&#13;
the optimal mix of investments, and iterative approximations should therefore&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
be made and various alternatives pondered. Farmers' expressed needs should be&#13;
a criterion in working out these iterative approximations, while planning of&#13;
investments should be made so as to facilitate the poorer peasants' ability to&#13;
share in the main benefits of development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

IV. THE METHODOLOGY FOR PARTICIPATION IN INVESTMENT PROGRAMMING&#13;
This chapter summarizes the organizational procedures arrived at in&#13;
PIDER for replacing the old routine of allocating government funds for&#13;
specific local investment needs. The actual adherence to, and the performance&#13;
of, these procedures in the real world may, of course, differ from the planned&#13;
model. It is therefore useful to consider first the '"odel" in its ideal&#13;
form, as it has been recommended by PIDER for implementation.&#13;
1. Information: To Whom and on What?&#13;
Promoting responsible and intense community involvement requires,&#13;
according to PAPCO (Programa de Apoyo a la Participacion de la Comunidad&#13;
Rural, PIDER's Support Program for Rural Community Participation), three&#13;
elements:&#13;
o    Information-motivation&#13;
o    Organization&#13;
o    Training.&#13;
Of the three elements, the first is the direct responsibility of PAPCO,&#13;
although all compartments of PIDER are expected to contribute their share in&#13;
it. It appears, at this writing, that the guidance for information&#13;
dissemination is worked out in PIDER much more clearly than the other two&#13;
elements (organization and training).&#13;
In brief, PAPCO first has the general objective of informing and&#13;
motivating rural communities to play an active and responsible part in their&#13;
own development. Second, PAPCO must make the technical staff of agencies&#13;
taking part in PIDER realize the important social function they perform,&#13;
because it is largely through their work that public resources are used to&#13;
trigger development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
Accordingly, PAPCO decided to address two kinds of public&#13;
distinctly: rural inhabitants and agency personnel. Each required&#13;
custom-tailored activities, defined as follows: 1/&#13;
As regards the rural communities:&#13;
o    To transmit to beneficiary rural communities information on&#13;
PIDER's objectives, atrategies, actions, and methods of&#13;
operation, thus to motivate and stimulate responsíble and active&#13;
participation&#13;
o    To increase the beneficiary population's bargaining position&#13;
with the agencies and entities taking part in the program, by&#13;
providing the communities with information on the rights and&#13;
obligations they acquire when they participate in PIDER and on&#13;
the relation they establish with government agencies, lending&#13;
institutions, and other community organizations&#13;
o    To help create a favorable attitude in the communities toward&#13;
PIDER in order to facilitate the actions of the implementing&#13;
agencies and entities, especially those responsible for&#13;
organizing and training the beneficiaries.&#13;
In our view, the second point above is particularly significant,&#13;
since it clearly spells out the political importance of information in&#13;
empowering the communities and strengthening their leverage over implementing&#13;
agencies, executing contractors, etc. Participation appears as not just a&#13;
generous "invitation" addressed to rural communities, but first a transfer of&#13;
power from the bureaucracy to the program beneficiaries, enabling the latter&#13;
to "bargain" better, to know their rights and obligations, and to exercise&#13;
decision-making and control over the agencies' work.&#13;
1/ See PAPCO Manual, 1982, pp. 15-16 (see bibliography.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
As regards the technical and administrative staff of the agencies and&#13;
entities participating in PIDER:&#13;
o    To provide them with more information on PIDER's guidelines,&#13;
objectives, strategies, and methods of operation, thus to&#13;
encourage them to take into consideration, in promoting their&#13;
specific projects or actions, that such projects and actions are&#13;
part of an integral strategy for community development&#13;
o    To get the technical and administrative staff of all agencies&#13;
taking part in PIDER to cooperate actively with PAPCO and, to&#13;
that end, to give them information about the objectives, goals,&#13;
and actions of PAPCO.&#13;
The latter set of activities goes hand in hand with the training&#13;
given to the technical staff in PIDER headquarters and regional offices,&#13;
educating them about the technical aspects of communication and dissemination&#13;
so that they can themselves generate focused information in accordance with&#13;
the guidelines. Overall, the information strategy favored by SPP emphasizes&#13;
the productive investments as the main vehicle through which communities can&#13;
develop.&#13;
As stated previously, PAPCO is directed at two types of audience:&#13;
the peasant beneficiaries and the technical-administrative staff of the&#13;
agencies contributing to PIDER, with a view to facilitating communication&#13;
between the two. While the topics to be covered are virtually the same for&#13;
both audiences, there are, however, differences in treatment and complexity&#13;
and in the type of medía to be used.&#13;
The topics recommended by PAPCO for the beneficiaries are the&#13;
followíng:&#13;
o    What PIDER is and what it does&#13;
o    The importance of rural community involvement in PIDER&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
o    PIDER's annual program and budget&#13;
o    Importance of PIDER's productive investments for community&#13;
development&#13;
o    Rural economic organization&#13;
o    The methods of operation of lending institutions.&#13;
The following topics must be covered for the second group,&#13;
technical-administrative staff:&#13;
o    What PIDER is and what it does&#13;
o    The principles of participation&#13;
o    PIDER in the context of other development programs going on in&#13;
Mexico&#13;
o    The importance of productive investments in PIDER (including&#13;
general standards for project formulation and evaluation)&#13;
o    PIDER's annual program and budget.&#13;
2. Three Phases of Participatory Programming&#13;
The time horizon of planning in PIDER is twofold: the medium-term&#13;
programming, which results in a three- to four-year program for investing&#13;
in infrastructure and services, and the short-term programming -- the&#13;
annual programming and budgeting exercise (colloquially called&#13;
"reprogramming"), which reassesses and specifies the objectives at the&#13;
beginning of every year of the medium-term program. The major effort for&#13;
fostering community initiatives takes place during the preparation of the&#13;
medium-term program.&#13;
A sequence of three phases is recommended in PIDER's methodology:&#13;
(a) Phase One: field assessment&#13;
(b) Phase Two: preliminary programming&#13;
(c) Phase Three: final programming.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
In each phase, the roles of both agencies and peasant groups are&#13;
carefully defined. The procedures for each stage cover both the sociological&#13;
and the technical elements of investment planning, prescribing what has to be&#13;
done at the grass-roots community level and also what technical-economic&#13;
feasibility analysis should be undertaken by the apecialized agencies.&#13;
The norms incorporated in PIDER'S programming methodology are binding&#13;
for the technical agencies which execute PIDER investments. Nevertheless,&#13;
since the norms entail additional efforts and time costs for these agencies,&#13;
whose staff have to do a considerably larger amount of field work in remote&#13;
communities than for other programs, there is presaure for "simplifying" the&#13;
phases of the participatory methodology.&#13;
Flexibility in adapting the programming procedures to local&#13;
circumstances is, of course, encouraged. But PIDER staff have primary&#13;
responsibility for enforcing the participatory procedures and for avoiding too&#13;
soft an interpretation of their flexibility. Flexibility ja used sometimes as&#13;
a legitimizing excuse for unwarranted sidestepping of participatory&#13;
procedures. The risk involved in an excessively "flexible" interpretation at&#13;
local levels is precisely that it might circumvent some of the innovative,&#13;
albeit more difficult, steps of the new methodology (see further, p. 88).&#13;
A summary outline of the three phases follows. 1/&#13;
(a) Phase One: Making Field Asaesaments&#13;
"Field assessment" i9 rather a comprehensive term, under which&#13;
several activities have to be carried out: data collection regarding existing&#13;
1/ Based on PIDER Guidelines and Manuals listed and annotated in the&#13;
bibliography.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
population, infrastructure, and resources in the microregion; assessment of&#13;
past programa; selection of communities eligible for the program; study and&#13;
diagnosis of each selected locality; meetings with local groups; selection of&#13;
investment proposals; preparation of an assessment report and of the proposed&#13;
strategy. This sequence of activities is graphically represented in Chart 1.&#13;
The most innovative -- and essential -- element of Phase One is the&#13;
work at community level, and this will be detailed in particulars below.&#13;
Prior to actual work in the field, though, the first step is to&#13;
collect all available background information on the microregion and its&#13;
municipalities (with respect to population, ecology, natural resources, land&#13;
tenure, productive activities, employment, etc.) to identify the region's&#13;
overall development potential and constraints. Then, a number of field teams&#13;
(two to three members) are created, consisting of staff from PIDER and from&#13;
technical agencies. Each team is assigned a number of localities in which to&#13;
carry out the village diagnosis. Before going out to the villages, a two- to&#13;
three-day seminar i8 to be held wíth the teams, at which the objectives,&#13;
procedures, and methods of work are explained and analyzed, routes are&#13;
assigned, and material support organized. The time frame for the field&#13;
diagnosis of each village is on average two days, divided into four main&#13;
activities.&#13;
The team starts with a trip through the village, to get to know&#13;
firsthand the social groups and the physical environment in which activities&#13;
are to be carried out, and to inform the residents of the objectives of the&#13;
study. A survey ís then conducted orally, using selected informants who&#13;
always include the authorities (ejido leaders; security committee, consejo de&#13;
vigilancia; municípal delegate; etc.), the local school teacher, medical&#13;
personnel (if any), and the leaders of other local organizations (parents'&#13;
association, credit groups, etc.).&#13;

The data collected 1/ through this kind of inquiry are recorded and&#13;
systematized in a survey form which, although the content remaina similar, has&#13;
to be adapted to the specific conditions in each region. This form also helps&#13;
the team to manage the discussions and to pursue the information gathering.&#13;
It was observed that, when the field team is more proficient and experienced,&#13;
the team is able to use the survey form only for recording answers, while&#13;
giving free rein to the discussions to cover any subject of interest to the&#13;
group.&#13;
Meetings with the community are the next step, and there are two ways&#13;
of holding thein: selected issues are discussed with certain groups&#13;
separately, or the meetíng is held in a large, integrated group in which all&#13;
the information of community interest is discussed. The second method ia&#13;
preferable, except where irreconcilable internal community differences exist,&#13;
since it allows for a comparison of views and provides more reliable&#13;
background information.  The composition of these meetings will also vary&#13;
according to the time available, the social characteristics of the village,&#13;
and the span of competence of the experts. In some cases, a combined meeting&#13;
of men, women, and young persons ¡s recommended; in others, separate meetings&#13;
should take place with each group. In certain cases of sharply polarized&#13;
communities, positive resulta were achieved by holding meetings with different&#13;
strata (rural dwellers with more land, with leas land, and without land; with&#13;
cattle and without cattle; etc.).&#13;
1/ The kind of data gathered in this part of the field work for communíty&#13;
diagnosis should illumínate: land tenure system and agrarian problems;&#13;
total and active population and seasonal migration; the land resources,&#13;
land quality and distríbution; production activities, their relative&#13;
importance, farming methods; agricultural output, productivity and&#13;
mnarkets; ownership of cattle; production technology; other production&#13;
resources and the degree to which they are used; infrastructure (water&#13;
supply, roada, marketing, telecommunications and postal services,&#13;
electrification, health education and drinking water) and how it operates;&#13;
credit and technical assistance and how they are rated; internal social&#13;
organization of the village; institutional activities and works&#13;
undertaken; investment neede and priorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
In Oriente de Morelos, for instance, three different groups were&#13;
established for a regular programming exercise: peasants with irrigated land,&#13;
those with rainfed land, and those with wage earnings.  As might be expected,&#13;
investment priorities were different for the three strata. Those with&#13;
irrigated land emphasized the need for technical assistance and marketing;&#13;
those with rainfed land gave priority to irrigation, and those without any&#13;
land proposed investments that did not involve landownership, such as&#13;
agroindustry and hog farms.&#13;
In some cases, when the field teams -- and particularly CIDER&#13;
researchers -- had more time and resources to work for programming, surveys&#13;
with individual questionnaires were carried out among a sample of farmers at&#13;
different socioeconomic levels. However, widespread application of this&#13;
procedure has proven impossible due to unaffordable costs in time and human&#13;
resources. Therefore, this detailed information gathering was not included in&#13;
the final methodology.&#13;
There ís no formal recipe in the participatory methodology for&#13;
organizing the joint discussions between the expert team and rural dwellers at&#13;
these meetinga, but possib e procedures are recommended for reaching agreement&#13;
on investment proposala and on assigning prioríties to them. 1/ The&#13;
1/ The recommended procedure for conducting such meetinga was described by&#13;
Jorge Echenique as follows:&#13;
The data obtained by the field team from various informants&#13;
should be summarized and presented to the village meeting (especially&#13;
with regarda to potential resources and their use, agricultural&#13;
production and releted problema, employment and migration). A review&#13;
of the production support services (credit and technical assistance)&#13;
and social services (education, health, drinking water, electricity,&#13;
communicatíona, etc.) should be part of this presentatíon. In making&#13;
this presentation, the field team members ahould instigate the&#13;
meeting to exprese views on proposals collected during the village&#13;
survey by asking direct questiona about them. For example, if the&#13;
team is told that in one ejido a large part of the irrigated land is&#13;
sown once each year, the question can be asked: Why not twice? This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
methodology insiste, though, that the diagnostic team should etrive to get the&#13;
`farmers' perspective" (see Chapter II, Section 2) on each individual&#13;
investment proposed and should record it on the report form.&#13;
In this way, both through indívidual discussions and group/village&#13;
meetings, the díagnostic stage brings together the planners and the&#13;
communities to share information, to identify existing potential and needs,&#13;
and to cooperate in defining the development priorities and approaches.  For&#13;
the planners, this is an action-oriented "study."  The planners are explicitly&#13;
expected to both learn from the local population and inform the population&#13;
about their technically based aseessments on the local opportunities for&#13;
development investments. Informing aud educating the local population is&#13;
considered essential for triggering genuine participation in programming,&#13;
since it is only when the affected communities possess information on the span&#13;
of available development options that they can exercise an informed choice.&#13;
(Footnote 1 to preceeding page, Cont'd)&#13;
question starts off the discussion, which must not be allowed to end&#13;
until the opinions of all present have been made known, however&#13;
contradictory these may be.&#13;
Subsequently, possible solutions to the problems can be&#13;
discussed, as well as the extent to which PIDER can provide the&#13;
answer. In the preceding case, for instance, the main reason for a&#13;
single sowing may have been the lack of water due to weaknesses in&#13;
the irrigation infrastructure, the possible solution being to expand&#13;
the atorage reservoir and to build canals. In such a situation, the&#13;
meeting would probably tend to apply for such a PIDER investment.&#13;
Finally, what is called the "peasants' perspective" on each&#13;
proposal should be defined.  This means to (a) asese which location&#13;
is regarded as optimal for the project, (b) who is perceived to be&#13;
the beneficiaries, (c) what are the expectations regarding the&#13;
technical characteristics of the project, (d) what will be the&#13;
community's contributions, and (e) which should be the organization&#13;
required to execute and then operate the project. The peasants'&#13;
perspective should be carefully recorded by the expert on the&#13;
individual forma for each project investment. ("Notes on Peasant&#13;
Participation in Rural Development Planning,` paper prepared for the&#13;
Sociological Workshop in Participation, August 1979; Washington,&#13;
D.C., World Bank, mimeo.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
Thus, the willingness and preparedness of the community to contribute to the&#13;
investments for various projecta (for instance, through labor, cash, or other&#13;
contributiona) is assessed during the village diagnosis.&#13;
It ij not surprising that, on many occasions substantiated investment&#13;
requests, put forward by the peasants during such public analysis, are&#13;
different from the solutions proposed by the experts. "Farmers' perspective"&#13;
often proves more adequate.&#13;
A significant example can be mentioned from an investment progranming&#13;
exercise in the microregion Baja California Sur. The experts from the&#13;
Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock (Secretaria de Agricultura y&#13;
Ganaderia, SAG) responded to the farmers' requesta for breeding cattle by&#13;
recommending the purchase of Swiss cattle. The farmers, however, had&#13;
proposed Zebu cattle. The PIDER experto argued that a cross of Swiss and the&#13;
local "Chinampo" cattle would be an excellent solution for meat and dairy&#13;
yields. The villagers nevertheless insisted on Zebu, and during the meeting&#13;
an interminable díscussion ensued, ending only after one determined farmer&#13;
described his past experience. He had purchased two Swiss breedera out of his&#13;
own funde followíng the recommendatíon of the experta. However, one cow díed&#13;
during the first dry season; the other he had to keep in his home due to its&#13;
poor physical condition. Looking into the causes, the farmer observed that&#13;
during the dry season the animala had to eat the topmost leaves off the&#13;
bushes, had to walk enormous distances to find water, and even drank seawater&#13;
at times. The Swiss cattle, with their short lega, could not get food and&#13;
water in this way, but the Zebu, with their long lega, were able to reach the&#13;
highest branches, even helped the other cattle to get food, and could aleo&#13;
travel to the most distant watering points. This ended the discussion.&#13;
The types and sequence of activities to be performed by a team in the&#13;
field in carrying out the community diagnosis are summarized in Table 2.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
Next, the investment proposals derived from each of the communities&#13;
must be analyzed and priority-ranked, using as main criteria:&#13;
o    The degree to vhich implementation of the investment proposal is&#13;
likely to solve the locality's development constraints (the criterion&#13;
is the ranking performed by the concerned community itself)&#13;
o    The economic benefits that implementation of the proposal will yield&#13;
(particularly in employment, income distribution, and surplus&#13;
production) compared with the cost-benefit analysis of possible&#13;
alternative investment proposals.&#13;
The appraisal of investment proposals put forward by local&#13;
communities requires economic, technical, and social analysis. The attention&#13;
given to social criteria should not obscure the need for sound economic&#13;
criteria and for using formalized techniques for measuring costs and benefits&#13;
or distributional consequences. A sound economic analysis is in the best&#13;
interest of the communities themselves and is an integral part of the&#13;
professional planners' contribution to the process of participatory&#13;
programming.&#13;
The final step of the diagnostic stage is the preparation of a&#13;
strategy report to provide the overall frame for the activities of all&#13;
agencies involved. The content of this strategy report will be as follows:&#13;
Diagnosis:&#13;
o    Evaluation of the strategy applied in the region with&#13;
respect to:&#13;
-    Characteristics of the main productive projects in&#13;
progress&#13;
-    Complementarity between productive, support, and&#13;
social projects&#13;
-    Consistency between productive resources, needs of the&#13;
region and application of the budget&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
o    Identification of principal resources and problems of the region:&#13;
-    Division into subregions and component localities&#13;
-    Productive resources, infrastructure, and services (by&#13;
subregion)&#13;
-    Principal problems (by subregion)&#13;
Development Objectives and Strategy:&#13;
o    Objectives&#13;
o    Strategy for the specific region:&#13;
-    Programming stages and criteria for priority ranking of&#13;
subregions and localities&#13;
-    Main investment projects, their justification, and their&#13;
execution sequence&#13;
Investment Proposals:&#13;
o    Names of the localities proposed for each stage&#13;
o    Investment proposals derived from the study of all the&#13;
localities&#13;
o    Request for preliminary projects for the localities included in&#13;
the programming for next year.&#13;
This report is the instrument for further decision-making on the&#13;
projects; therefore, the information under the above headings must be&#13;
very precise.&#13;
The investment proposals put forward by the peasant population&#13;
have to be examined in detail by the technical agencies. The agencies&#13;
will assess the technical feasibility and socioeconomic implications of&#13;
each proposal in light of the justifying data supplied by the field&#13;
team. This assessment may result in eliminating some of the least&#13;
feasible or least beneficial proposals. Information on this technical&#13;
assessment and selection process should be communicated to, explained,&#13;
and discussed with members of grass-roots communities to reach a broad&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
agreement within the communities on how their needs and aspirations&#13;
should be otherwise satisfied by the program.&#13;
(b) Phase Two: Preliminary Programming&#13;
The second stage of iterative approximation in the feasibility&#13;
assessment process consists of the preparation of preliminary but&#13;
integrated investment plans. This phase of the work is the direct&#13;
responsibility of the agencies and would take one to two months. The&#13;
analysis of the investment proposals put forward during Phase One will be&#13;
carried out jointly by the agencies and PIDER for each of the preliminary&#13;
projects contemplated, using the following criteria:&#13;
o    Internal cohesion of the project (e.g., consistency of installed&#13;
capacity with raw materials availability and with potential&#13;
market)&#13;
o    Estimated benefits of the preliminary projects:  direct benefits&#13;
estimated in terms of the number of peasant families that will&#13;
benefit from the preliminary project, the production employment,&#13;
and the income increase it is expected to generate; estimates&#13;
will attempt to specify the social groups that will benefit&#13;
within each locality and the position they occupy in the local&#13;
system of social stratification&#13;
o    Unit-investment parameters of PIDER:  maximum investment&#13;
coefficíents (per-family, per-hectare, etc.) which have to be&#13;
adhered to for each project category covered by PIDER.&#13;
Where necessary, the data furnished for the proposed projects will be&#13;
rechecked in the field.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
The next step consists of the preparation of integrated investment&#13;
programs for the microregions by the technical agencies, through grouping&#13;
together the proposed projects. The main criteria for inclusion of projects&#13;
in the preliminary investment program are: (a) good quality of the detailed&#13;
preparation studies; (b) complementarity between projects; (c) relatively low&#13;
investment per beneficiary; (d) comparatively lower investment per man&#13;
employed; (e) relatÉively greater impact on production per unit of investment.&#13;
In consolidating the preliminary investment program, it is of course necessary&#13;
to bear in mind the probable budgetary constraints.&#13;
The preliminary investment program has to establish which ones of the&#13;
proposed local projects can be considered as final for purposes of preparation&#13;
of the final program, whích ones will be included in the next annual program&#13;
for their study phase but not yet for their execution phase, and which ones&#13;
will not bie included in the final phase of the program at all. (See Chart 2)&#13;
(c) Phase Three: Final Programming&#13;
The main purpose of this phase is to move to a higher level of&#13;
consolidation of the microregional PIDER program through the formulation and&#13;
analysis of specific investment projects. The technical agencies would&#13;
finalize the specific projects on the basis of the comments made in each&#13;
preliminary project. SPP would review the individual projects together with&#13;
the persons who prepared the studies. The project-analysis criteria are&#13;
similar to those used in Phase Two.&#13;
Some productive projects (fruit growing, agroindustries, etc.) which&#13;
require working-capital financing need to be presented in a way that&#13;
facilitates their technical appraisal by the banks. The object is&#13;

to tie in the proposed fixed investment with the analysis criteria used by the&#13;
most suitable sources of financing supplemental to PIDER.&#13;
The final investment program for the microregion must be coherent, in&#13;
the sense that its component parta fit together internally, and must be&#13;
consistent as a whole with the strategy adopted to accomplish the development&#13;
objectives for the region. It must be sequential, since it extends over a&#13;
time period of four years.  And it must be technically and economically&#13;
feasible.&#13;
The final microregional PIDER investment program will have the&#13;
following sequence: (a) strategy and objectives; (b) programa (productive&#13;
programa, support programa, social programs); (c) consolidated program&#13;
budgets; (d) appraisal.&#13;
During the PIDER III project, a atronger emphasis than before is&#13;
being put on the economic and financial appraisal of each proposed&#13;
investment. The appraisal criteria are derived from the general objectives of&#13;
PIDER and the particular objectives of the specific program. They take into&#13;
consideration, in particular, the increases generated in levels of production,&#13;
income, and employment. A financial appraisal is carried out as well,&#13;
applying the cash-flow discounting metbod and using the basic indicators of&#13;
cost-benefit ratio and internal rate of return. 1/&#13;
The integrated investment program for each microregion is submitted&#13;
for financing approval to the management of the PIDER program. After PIDER's&#13;
final review of the program, the appropriate adjustments are made in light of&#13;
the available budget.&#13;
1/ The cost-benefit flows are calculated for a twenty-five-year period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
The participatory methodology recommends that, at the end of this&#13;
three-phase proceso, the final investment program be made known to the&#13;
beneficiaries, who initially contributed their proposals during the first&#13;
phases. Local meetings have a particular importance before implementation&#13;
begins.&#13;
The community's thorough knowledge of what investments have been&#13;
finally approved, of the implementation schedule, and of the resources&#13;
provided by the government or to be contributed by the beneficiaries is an&#13;
essential prerequisite for subsequent effective implementation and monitoring&#13;
of the entire program.&#13;
SPP recommends that the final program be communicated to community&#13;
meetings with a clear explanation of the general background of the program --&#13;
specifically, of the changes introduced during the preliminary and final&#13;
programming stages as they compare with the initial proposals put forward by&#13;
the peasants.&#13;
The extension agenta, SPP staff, and personnel from different&#13;
agencies should develop an educational effort around the final development&#13;
programa for the benefit of the villagers as a means of mobilizing community&#13;
awareness and support for the implementation and monitoring of the program.&#13;

V.  PARTICIPATION IN IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING&#13;
As noted previously, toward the late 1970s the shortcomings in the&#13;
effectiveness of implementation and in the usefulness of completed investments&#13;
made PIDER's top management painfully aware of the need to expand its efforts&#13;
to extend beneficiaries' participation in the programming stage to other&#13;
stages of the project cycle -- particularly to implementation and monitoring.&#13;
Some procedures have been devised and institutional arrangements introduced in&#13;
this respect. These have not, however, gone through the cycle of testing,&#13;
experimentation, and revision that participatory programming methodology&#13;
underwent.&#13;
1. Resource Mobilization through Participation in Implementation&#13;
PAPCO has formulated strong recommendations about participation in&#13;
implementation:&#13;
To get a community truly committed to a Program, its members must not&#13;
only participate in defining goals and programming infrastructure and&#13;
services; they must take part in implementation, ... in making&#13;
choices from among the options that continually arise as a work is&#13;
being constructed or a services program is being carried out. The&#13;
community must be shown how program resources are to be used and,&#13;
above all, how their own contributions are to be used. Community&#13;
information on works constructed and services provided in its&#13;
territory will be more complete when community members participate in&#13;
the work, instead of merely being passive spectators on the&#13;
sidelines. It is even more valuable if communities are asked to keep&#13;
a record of the progress made, analyze that information with the&#13;
follow-up and evaluation resident officer and propose required&#13;
corrective action when possible. 1/&#13;
1/ PAPCO Manual, 1982, p. 10 (see bibliography).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
Precise norms have been introduced regarding the specific&#13;
contributions PIDER beneficiaries are expected to make as their own share in&#13;
the state-funded investments in their communities. Participation is thus&#13;
conceived, inter alia, as a way to mobilize local resources for development.&#13;
Beneficaries' physical or financial contribution to projects in their&#13;
own communities is pursued by PIDER also as an expression of commitment to&#13;
their projects by those who are supposed to take over the newly constructed&#13;
infrastructural assets to operate and maintain them.&#13;
The inhabitants of the localities in which PIDER investments are made&#13;
contribute a fraction of the total cost of the state-funded projects -- in&#13;
cash, in materials available locally, or in contribution of labor. 1/ The&#13;
amount of contribution varies with the specific type of project, and PIDER has&#13;
instituted differential coefficients:&#13;
o    For productive projects, 10% of the value of the public investment&#13;
o    For potable water systems and the construction of publíc buildings,&#13;
15% of total investment&#13;
o    For village electrification projects, according to a quota system&#13;
instituted, between 5-15% of total investment 2/&#13;
o    For housing improvement projects, at least 50% of the total cost of&#13;
the work through labor, cash, or local materials (PIDER's&#13;
contribution can not exceed 2,500 pesos per capita, covering the cost&#13;
of technical assistance and of materials that are not locally&#13;
available).&#13;
1/ "Manual de procedimientos para la programacion-presupuestacion" (Mexico,&#13;
D.F.: SSP/PIDER, 1982), p. 34.&#13;
2/ This quota system has been established by the Federal Commission for&#13;
Electricity and is based on the economic level of the area: the poorer&#13;
the area, the amaller the quota of local contribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
To formalize the commitment for such contributions, a standard&#13;
agreement form has been devised ("Acta de Acceptacion de la Comunidad") to be&#13;
signed by PIDER and intended beneficiaries before the project begins, which&#13;
includes a certification of the contribution the beneficiaries have agreed to&#13;
make. Although this standard agreement often is not refined enough to reflect&#13;
differential needs and differential contribution ability within nonhomogeneous&#13;
communities, the formulation of the set of mutual (agencies and communities)&#13;
obligations is a step forward in institutionalizing the participatory approach.&#13;
An example may help clarify the mechanism of resource utilization.&#13;
"La Marina", a fishery cooperative in the state of Tamaulipas with a&#13;
membership of 54 fishermen, has been assisted by PIDER to develop a shrimp&#13;
farm. The total investment required was about 39.1 million pesos. The&#13;
agreement signed by the cooperative (Acta de Acceptation) with PIDER provided&#13;
for a PIDER investment grant of about 13.2 million pesos (33.7%) while the&#13;
membership was to contribute directly 2 million pesos through cash, labor and&#13;
materials, (representing 5.1% of total costs, or 15% of the public investment;&#13;
this is above the coefficient set by PIDER for contributions to productive&#13;
projects. Additional funds totaling 23.9 million pesos (61.1%) are provided&#13;
to the cooperative through credit (6.3 million short term and 17.6 million&#13;
long term). The credit is also facilitated through PIDER funds, but is to be&#13;
gradually repaid, thus increasing resource utilization and building up the&#13;
fishermen's equity. The beneficiaries contribution through borrowed resources&#13;
to this project ¡8 remarkably high. Without PIDER's financial and technical&#13;
assistance, however, this productive development could not have taken place:&#13;
PIDER has provided the working capital for neta, engines, pond construction,&#13;
and made possible the credit as well. Benefits accruing to the fishermen are&#13;
estimated to be seven times the local minimum wages; however, only about 50Z&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
will be distributed to the membership, while the rest will be used by the&#13;
cooperative for reinvestment and credit repayment.&#13;
However, the coefficients for community resource mobilization for&#13;
various projects, while useful in their overall orientation, raise certain&#13;
problems in implementation. These coefficients, if not properly explained to&#13;
and understood by the project's ultimate beneficiaries, may come across as&#13;
rather rigid and coercive. They could see it as "exploitation" or just&#13;
another form of taxation. Unless it is clear from the outcome that the area&#13;
population really wants a specific investment and will benefit from it, a&#13;
contribution "quota" will not achieve their purpose. In that respect, PAPCO&#13;
has a role to play in enhancing peasants' awareness about the mechanics of&#13;
participatory investments: the point is in explaining to the farmers that, no&#13;
matter how large the public resources allocated by the state to the area, the&#13;
needs are exponentially larger. Therefore, only with sharing in the costs&#13;
could beneficiary communities magnify the amount and the ímpact of local&#13;
investments.&#13;
The mobilization local resources elevates the consultation process&#13;
carried out in the programming stage to a more substantive level of&#13;
participation: the actual execution of projects. In addition, the&#13;
developmental benefits from this kind of participation extend further than the&#13;
amount of resources locally mobilized. Participation in execution sets the&#13;
stage for handing over the completed projects to beneficiaries for subsequent&#13;
operation and maintenance.&#13;
The strategy for promoting participation has to contend with&#13;
sociopsychological and behavioral objectives of no less importance than the&#13;
economic ones: it attempts to trigger more initiative and development&#13;
activism; to establish patterns of group action; to develop the&#13;
sociopsychological perception of collective interests, of enhanced power&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
through joint power, and of a sense of proprietorship and commitment for the&#13;
finished products. Such subtler (but consequential in the long run)&#13;
objectives might easily be overlooked if the emphasis is put one-sidedly just&#13;
on the administrative (sometimes coercive) collection of the 10-15% local&#13;
contribution.&#13;
In fact, the official requirement that local communities contribute a&#13;
fraction of investment costs turns out to affect not only communities, but the&#13;
technicians' behavior as well: it makes the planners and engineers more&#13;
concerned with consulting the peasants than before, with getting the peasants'&#13;
assent and contribution, and with actually involving them in the works. But&#13;
the weakness (if not the sheer absence) of peasants' village-level&#13;
organizations, which could act also as linkage systems between technical&#13;
staff/agencies and individual peasants (or lack of understanding of already&#13;
existing peasant organizations), significantly diminishes participation in&#13;
implementation. It appears that certain technical agencies and small&#13;
contractors preferred the simpler approach of using paid skilled laborer&#13;
rather than bothering with mobilizing beneficiaries' labor or with training&#13;
beneficiaries for these jobs. Some dishonest contractors used the provisions&#13;
for labor contribution to mobilize such free labor but then tried to charge&#13;
PIDER for the free labor the beneficiaries contributed.&#13;
It is precisely at this juncture that PIDER's methodology for&#13;
participatory implementation, in our view, has not been sufficiently worked&#13;
out and refined. The methodology is insufficiently tailored toward making use&#13;
of the potential available in Mexican villages for eliciting resource&#13;
mobilizatíon, promoting grass-root farmer organizations and triggering the&#13;
related cultural and attitudinal changes. Comparatively less social&#13;
engineering effort and fewer skills have gone into preparing, testing, and&#13;
perfecting this segment of the methodology. Since the phasing out in 1981 of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
CIDER's methodological contributions, PIDER'S current structure has lacked a&#13;
special interdisciplinary group of social researchers (sociologists,&#13;
anthropologists, public administrators, economists, etc.) to put their time&#13;
and minds together to work on such issues, and the methodological progress has&#13;
slowed down. The absence of such a "think tank", consisting of operationally&#13;
oriented professional researchers, within the General Directorate which&#13;
oversees PIDER, has slowed down the methodological work and the conceptuali-&#13;
zation and codification of the new experiences.&#13;
However, the new PIDER administration appointed after the last&#13;
presidential election seems to pay increased attention to these participatory&#13;
implementation issues; further and later evaluations will be able to show&#13;
whether the changes now intended will be sustained indeed and will result in&#13;
better participation in project execution.&#13;
2. The Best Monitoring System: The Beneficiaries&#13;
Monitoring the physical execution of PIDER investment is another area&#13;
of crucial importance for participation. The power given local communities to&#13;
contribute in the shape of the investment programs for local development&#13;
should be logically complemented by empowering them to monitor effectively the&#13;
execution of the projects.&#13;
The main lesson to be extracted from the experience with implementing&#13;
previous PIDER activities is that the immediacy and quality of field checking&#13;
by beneficiary groups of the work of various agencies is the key for timely&#13;
use of investments.&#13;
PIDER's investments at community level go for a wide range of&#13;
nonstandard works to be performed by countless local contractors hired by&#13;
agencies cooperating with PIDER. Therefore, only if the field staff of PIDER&#13;
would cooperate with project beneficiaries could they together make certain&#13;
that contractors' performance is timely and qualitatively adequate and that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
agency follow-up reporting conforms with actual accomplishments and is&#13;
watchful of initial project planning.&#13;
SPP does not have enough paid staff at state and microregional levels&#13;
to monitor systematically all its numerous work sites. Unless the&#13;
participation of interested communities is secured, it has no chance for an&#13;
effective monitoring process. Therefore, during the implementation of PIDER&#13;
III, SPP is strengthening its monitoring system by establishing in PIDER&#13;
microregions working groups consisting of representatives of the main&#13;
executing agencies and of the benefiting municipalities. These working&#13;
groups, chaired by the PIDER microregional coordinator, meet to review jointly&#13;
the progress of PIDER investments.&#13;
Our review of experience in the state of Guerrero for this study&#13;
suggests that the participation of community representatives in more or less&#13;
informal monitoring parties has been effective. The beneficiaries are most&#13;
interested in having the investments completed and delivered to them in time;&#13;
they are well placed to verify whether the actual exe ution performance is as&#13;
reported by technical agencies. Various examples in Guerrero indicated that&#13;
community representatives became local exponents of the grievances of their&#13;
villages regarding the procrastination of completion schedules, dishonest&#13;
contractors, or negligent state-agency staff.&#13;
There is wide agreement that there has been much waste in PIDER's&#13;
community projects -- in cost overruns, incompleted projects, or "completed"&#13;
but unusable projects. 1/ The most efficient way to curb this waste is to&#13;
1/ The dismal state of routine administrative monitoring, without beneficiary&#13;
participation, was revealed during the mid-term analysis of PIDER I, when&#13;
it appeared that central PIDER management had lost track of the correct&#13;
numbers and sitinga of PIDER local projects, and a full-scale inventory&#13;
had to be undertaken (see Michael M. Cernea, Measuring Project Impact,&#13;
World Bank Staff Working Paper No. 332; Washington, D.C., June 1979.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
assure the participation of beneficiary communities in monitoring the real&#13;
progress and quality of local works, hand in hand with state officials (but&#13;
not by officials alone).&#13;
In addition, participation of beneficiaries is the only solution to&#13;
the recurrent cost problem, whicb is a long-term issue. It entails&#13;
involvement of beneficiaries in building and monitoring projects as a&#13;
preliminary step to taking over and operating the new infrastructural assets,&#13;
with community maintenance and cost responsibility.&#13;
For efficient participation in monitoring, the village communities&#13;
should be better informed, through regular communication mechanisms, about the&#13;
content, objectives, and deadlines of the investment programs affecting them.&#13;
Hardly does the political significance of information appear clearer than in&#13;
the context of the beneficiaries' ability to control and monitor construction&#13;
and delivery. By summer 1983, SPP was considering the enactment of agreements&#13;
with state governments and with the National Accounting Office which would&#13;
formalize the obligation of all agencies to provide information to&#13;
beneficiaries on the schedule, costs, characteristica and completion dates of&#13;
projects. Thus would be accompanied by formal arrangements for monitoring&#13;
through beneficiaries and by-monthly reports from municipal authorities on&#13;
PIDER projects progress. The knowledge of what they should expect (and when)&#13;
from the various local projects and from the contractors in charge of&#13;
executing them would enable the target groups to feed back to PIDER staff&#13;
their own monitoring signals on the progress and adequacy of these works.&#13;
More information to the peasants would facilitate more involvement and better&#13;
monitoring of project implementation. At the same time, it would be necessary&#13;
to establish a clear and independent grievance procedure for the beneficiaries&#13;
who are unsatisfied with agency performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
The monitoring of implementation is prone to generate conflicts. To&#13;
a certain extent, this may be constructive in accelerating solution-seeking&#13;
efforts. The overall interest of program and beneficiaries alike requires&#13;
that, when investments are wasted, construction is delayed, or quality&#13;
sacrificed, those responsible be brought to task. Giving communities formal&#13;
rights to monitor PIDER-financed projects--and the information needed to do&#13;
so, as well as acceas to political leaders to communicate their findings and&#13;
to voice complaints--is a tangible form of empowerment. An independent --&#13;
i.e., other then PIDER -- grievance procedure for complaints about PIDER&#13;
subprojects would certainly encourage participation in monitoring. Inasmuch&#13;
as this is regarded as part of the participatory methodology, it js bound, in&#13;
our view, to make participation more meaningful and consequential.&#13;
Significantly, one of the main current difficulties for PAPCO, as&#13;
indicated by a SPP official in March 1983, 1/ has been to persuade technical&#13;
agencies at local level to inform beneficiary communities in advance about the&#13;
timetable of their works and about the technical specifications of expected&#13;
projects. The reluctance of many technical staff to release this information&#13;
is an attempt to circumvent meaningful monitoring by the beneficiaries and to&#13;
hamper the mechanism for grievances.&#13;
The political problems faced by programs with redistributive goals&#13;
reveal themselves in PIDER at implementation time more conspicuously than in&#13;
the planning stage. The caciques or other narrow interests groups often&#13;
attempt to coopt agency staff and to divert works and investments toward&#13;
personal gaíns. This makes the administration of policy and investments as&#13;
important an area as the formulation of policy. In Mexico, as in some other&#13;
developing countries, because of the characteristics of the political systems,&#13;

the influence of political participation and of group demand-making is&#13;
exercised at the enforcement stage of programs more effectively than at the&#13;
policy-making stage. 1/ This points even more to the need for SPP to&#13;
formalize the participatory monitoring methods and to watch for their&#13;
consistent implementation.&#13;
The orientation toward continuous involvement of beneficiaries&#13;
dovetails with the decentralization of management authority under PIDER III,&#13;
which will work orly if accompanied with tenacious enforcement of reporting&#13;
and monitoring procedures. In this way, the feedback information from PIDER&#13;
beneficiaries and local staff will rapidly move up the chain of command and&#13;
prompt corrective action to rectify delays or shortfalls.&#13;
Despite the positive results obtained through involving beneficiaries&#13;
in monitoring, the three Manuals on project execution, monitoring, and&#13;
evaluation issued by SPP during 1982 2/ put disappointingly little emphasis on&#13;
participation. They reiterate the conventional approach to monitoring,&#13;
reporting or surveying and do not give guidance for setting up a social&#13;
mechanism for monitoring implementation through organized beneficiary&#13;
involvement. This is an obvious weakness of PIDER's methodology, in fact a&#13;
step backward from what had been successfully experimented and could have been&#13;
conceptualized and generalized.&#13;
A closer review of the Manuals on execution control and monitoring&#13;
reveals that they go a little more beyond a compilation of reporting forms for&#13;

the control of physical and financial project inputs. Several'goals are meant&#13;
to be attained through this effort, among which are preventing, detecting, and&#13;
correcting deviations from budgetary planning; locating and resolving problems&#13;
encountered in execution of works and services; carrying out the means&#13;
reconmended for correcting deviations between planned and actual courses of&#13;
activity; improving short- and mid-term planning efforts through efficient&#13;
reporting progreas; etc. While these are valid (and well-known) goals to&#13;
which nobody can object, the Manuals at best offer some suggestions on how to&#13;
identify and diagnose problems, but they do not provide in-depth guidance&#13;
about how to solve them, how to seek alternative solutions and how to socially&#13;
engineer steps to carry out these solutions. The formulae given have no real&#13;
methodological or pragmatic bases on which to take corrective actions. The&#13;
suggested reporting formats epitomize the top-down approach familiar since the&#13;
first phases of the PIDER program. Wnile the second Manual, on monitoring,&#13;
somehow improves on the first one, it remains rather declarative about the&#13;
need to consult with beneficiaries about the works' progress and problems. No&#13;
"tools" are provided to set up committees or other means to make sure the&#13;
solutions are implemented by the responsible agencies and beneficiaries. The&#13;
Manual points to preoperational and operational stages to gauge how the works&#13;
are shaping up, but it does not tie these to setting up preoperational and&#13;
operational social mechanisms for building, operating, and maintaining the&#13;
works.&#13;
Important as they are for crystallizing a methodology, manuals alone&#13;
are not enough: they need to reflect and feed back the social experience&#13;
accumulated with the given methodology and need to be absorbed and applied in&#13;
a manner true to their spirit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
The effectiveness of monitoring and evaluation, particularly in a&#13;
poverty-oriented program like PIDER, depends also on the values, attitudes,&#13;
and commitnent of the monitors themselves. In this case, it depends on the&#13;
work style of PIDER staff, on their motivation to give full support to the&#13;
interests and needs of the poverty groups who are the intended target of the&#13;
program.&#13;
The state-level and microregional PIDER staff have, of course, to&#13;
perform their monitoring duties over other agencies not just as simple&#13;
technical supervisors, but as genuine development agents. This is part and&#13;
parcel of the reorientation of the bureaucratic agencies toward a&#13;
participatory approach. In practical terms, it means that this staff, in&#13;
addition to paying attention to physical and financial progress, would have to&#13;
shift the emphasis toward monitoring whether the completed investments are&#13;
indeed put to use by their expected beneficiaries. It would encourage the&#13;
involvement of the rural community and, especially, of the program's intended&#13;
beneficiaries into the monitoring and evaluation process. This would also&#13;
enable the monitoring staff to alert management about malfunctioning of some&#13;
PIDER-completed works, as signaled by the beneficiaries themselves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

VI. PROGRESS IN ACTUAL PARTICIPATION&#13;
The transition from model to practice is both immediate and long&#13;
term. Immediate only in the sense that it merely takes a decision (albeit, at&#13;
high level) to institute the new model formally as a set of norms; the real&#13;
transition is actually a long-term one because it takes a long learning&#13;
process until a huge bureaucracy slowly turns around to do things in a&#13;
different way.&#13;
The application of the participatory model described in the previous&#13;
chapters has been gradually extended to a majority of PIDER microregions.&#13;
However, while the formulation of this model has been a major progress, it&#13;
does not mean that all local investments are currently planned this way. Nor&#13;
does it mean that the application of the model advances smoothly and&#13;
unhampered by bureaucratic routines or is fully consistent with the intentions&#13;
of the methodology.&#13;
Limited as it is, the available evidence points out both genuine&#13;
progress in participatory planning and serious constraints. SPP/PIDER has not&#13;
yet undertaken a full-scale, soul-searching assessment of the extent to which&#13;
(and consistency with which) the participatory model is actually applied in&#13;
various states; a study carried out in 1982 was aborted, and another one is&#13;
being planned for the second half of 1983. Therefore, while we do not claim&#13;
to make a comprehensive evaluation of the scale and effectiveness of the&#13;
participatory approach in PIDER, we will point out several significant aspects&#13;
of the progress achieved and of the physical results of PIDER I and II. The&#13;
structural and organizational constraints on actual participation, as we see&#13;
them, will be further discussed in some detail in Chapter VII.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1.  Gradual Expansion&#13;
The significant progress made in operationalizing the dialogue&#13;
between communities and planners became visible on a large scale in 1979,&#13;
during the preparation of the Zacatecas State Development Plan. This&#13;
effort was the first instance when the plan of an entire state was&#13;
prepared through the new methodology; it exemplified both the attention&#13;
paid to local conditions and the increased confidence in beneficiaries'&#13;
participation in planning.&#13;
The programming exercise included diagnostic studies in all&#13;
communities with populations of between 250 and 3,000; in addition,&#13;
communities of more than 3,000 inhabitants were contacted through their&#13;
authorities. The survey work itself had two foci--locality studies and&#13;
sectoral studies. For the former, sixty field teams using a total of 120&#13;
technical experts carried out the diagnostic work; in the sectoral&#13;
studies, eight groups including over 100 technicians were responsible for&#13;
the analysis. The survey results were impressive: it was estimated that&#13;
about 80% of the total population of Zacatecas state was contacted by the&#13;
field teams. A total of 4,029 investment proposals were received as a&#13;
result of direct consultations with communities, and an additional 2,209&#13;
projects were proposed by government departments. After analysis of the&#13;
survey data, work proceeded on the definition of priority objectives,&#13;
strategies, specific investments for various communities, and sector&#13;
plans. Interaction between local communities and government represen-&#13;
tatives was achieved in each of the three phases (see Chapter IV)&#13;
outlined by the participatory guidelines: field assessment, preliminary&#13;
programming, and final programming.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
The formal institutionalization of the participatory approach&#13;
made further progress with the advent of the PIDER III project. During&#13;
1980, eight microregions in four different states were programmed with&#13;
the new procedures; it was also decided that all other PIDER III micro-&#13;
regions would gradually introduce the participatory approach in&#13;
determining community investments.&#13;
During late 1982, a field review of the experience with the&#13;
participation methodology was made in the states of Nayarit and&#13;
Chihuahua. 1/  In Nayarit, the assessment confirmed the key role played&#13;
by the information and motivation program developed by PAPCO to explain&#13;
the purpose and resources of PIDER to local communities. In the state of&#13;
Chihuahua, similar evidence showed the increased effort by PIDER staff to&#13;
involve themselves in project planning at the community level. PIDER&#13;
technicians in Chihuahua reside in the microregions for which they are&#13;
responsible. Extension agents are assigned to specific communities and&#13;
are responsible for supervising investment works in progress and&#13;
beneficiary organizations there. 2/ The review ascertained a clear&#13;

in Latin America -- An Assessment," draft report of consultant study for&#13;
the World Bank by AMEC, Inc. (1983), Appendix 4, mimeo.&#13;
2/ The review cited here described the procesa as follows:&#13;
"First a team (the director, PIDER extension agent, and other&#13;
extension agents from line agencies who work in the community under&#13;
study) examine all written and statistical materials available on the&#13;
community in the central office. Second, they collect and summarize&#13;
the knowledge that the field technicians have about the community.&#13;
Third, they convoke a meeting in the community to explain what the&#13;
nature of the study is and for what purpose . . . At this stage, the&#13;
participation of the community consists of: (1) assembling all&#13;
members into a general meeting ín order to allow knowledgeable people&#13;
from the community to give the PIDER officials more detailed&#13;
information...(2) collecting pertinent documents such as land titles&#13;
and previous loan agreements. The socio-economic study team asks&#13;
questions abaut the population, social behavior of the community,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
qualitative difference in PIDER's approach to communication with, and&#13;
involvement in, local communities for investment planning from that in&#13;
the earlier phases of the project. The institutional commitment to&#13;
implementing the PAPCO guidelines on participation has evidently&#13;
broadened the avenues for communication between ejidatarios and the&#13;
agency representatives.&#13;
Given the vastness of the PIDER program, spread over more than&#13;
100 microregions in all the states of Mexico, it is difficult to make&#13;
generalizations about the extent and quality of implementation of the new&#13;
approach without empirical evaluations in every area. Certainly, the&#13;
levels and quality of application are not uníform; major flaws are&#13;
probably still present, and such an ongoing evaluation should now become&#13;
a concern in PIDER's follow-up of the participatory methodology.&#13;
2. Decentralization&#13;
A parallel and interrelated development, propitious for the&#13;
strengthening of the participatory orientation, has been the substantial&#13;
decentralization process launched under PIDER III. This decentralization&#13;
was a necessary complement to promoting participation at the lowest&#13;
level, since maintaining tight central mangement control upon each&#13;
microregion in PIDER was no longer consonant with the process of vesting&#13;
expanded rights in the local communities. In 1980 it was decided to&#13;
effect institutional changes at the higher levels of the bureaucracy; the&#13;

outside of the community, and about land tenure. They inquire&#13;
into the form and composition of social groups within the&#13;
ejido. Finally, the team tries to elicit the community's&#13;
response to prevíous development experiences and to the line&#13;
agencies responsible for earlier projects. (Lacroix and Caro,&#13;
"Integrated Rural Development," Appendix 4, pp. 29-30.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
role of the federal and state administration were reexamined, and&#13;
increased authority was assigned to state governments.&#13;
Indeed, during the PIDER I and II projects in the 19709, SPP&#13;
staff assigned to PIDER used to have the responsibility for planning the&#13;
investment package for each microregion; each executing agency was then&#13;
requested to construct those works which fell under its purview and was&#13;
provided with PIDER investment funds. The state government exercised a&#13;
rather symbolic funetion in this respect. For PIDER III, however, the&#13;
situation was reversed, and in 1980 state governments were given&#13;
authority and responsibility for the programming, budgeting, and&#13;
coordination of the microregional PIDER investment programs. Central SPP&#13;
staff retained only guiding and broad monitoring functions. This&#13;
decentralization was also intended to enhance the states' capability for&#13;
multiyear investment programming, to improve the technical quality of&#13;
project preparation, and to shoulder the strategy of involving&#13;
beneficiaries in planning. According to the new system, state&#13;
governments prepare (and coordinate) investment plans for three-four year&#13;
periods, based on priority needs identified by the rural communities.&#13;
Revisions and detailed specifications of actual investments are done&#13;
annually.&#13;
These institutional changes are currently being implemented&#13;
under PIDER III, and several World Bank supervision and technical&#13;
assistance teams have assessed the progreso. A November 1982 project&#13;
supervision team concluded that the way the new, decentralized&#13;
organization operates "represente a significant transfer of power in the&#13;
formulation and control of rural development programs from SPP-PIDER to&#13;
the State Governors' offices." The extent of this transfer, however, is&#13;
not yet uniform in all states, and the decentralization procesa i8 8till&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

to continue and gain genuine grounds. Significant political support to&#13;
both the decentralization trend, and to institutionalizing participation,&#13;
was given recently by the newly elected administration. One of its&#13;
first, politically symbolic acts was to introduce a modification in&#13;
Mexico's Constitution which requires the executive powers to establish&#13;
clear procedures for popular consultation and participation in the&#13;
national planning systems. 1/ The National Development Plan for&#13;
1983-1988, issued in May 1983, reiterates this commitments and devotes a&#13;
special section to the modalities for "society participation in plan&#13;
implementation" 2/&#13;
The current organization of SPP has the potential to meet these&#13;
objectives if its principles and operational guidelines are effectively&#13;
applied. This is likely to depend largely on the ability and willingness&#13;
of the individual state governors and SPP state delegations to insist on&#13;
the implementation of these policies. Of particular interest in the&#13;
future development of this process will be the extent to which wishes of&#13;
beneficiaries are taken into account.&#13;
3. PIDER's Physical Impact&#13;
While implementation of PIDER III continues, aggregate data on the&#13;
investments made under PIDER I and PIDER II are gradually becoming&#13;
available. These data depiet a mixed image of successes and failures, an&#13;
image of achievements that, for some sectors, are substantial but that&#13;
generally fall below the level projected at appraisal time.&#13;

Mexico.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
As various evaluations have concluded l/, one of the main causes of&#13;
the shortcomings can be traced to the top-down way in which investments were&#13;
planned in the early years of PIDER, before the participatory methodology was&#13;
elaborated and tested. Nevertheless, a brief, albeit incomplete, overview of&#13;
these results is relevant for the present discussion.&#13;
The vast majority of completed PIDER I investments were made at the&#13;
community level. These included 687 small-scale irrigation schemes&#13;
(averagíng 70 hectares each), 372 fruit tree planting projects (averaging 22&#13;
hectares), 276 livestock development projects (averaging 228 cattle head),&#13;
277 soil and water conservation projects (averaging 822 hectares), 658 rural&#13;
roads projects (averaging 7.3 kilometers), 583 rural electrification projecta&#13;
(averaging 2 kilometers), 303 health centers, 1,005 primary school&#13;
clasarooms, and 793 drinking water systems.&#13;
The financial participation of beneficiaries in such projects was&#13;
still relatively limited. According to overall PIDER statistics 2/ for the&#13;
five year period 1977-1981 (which overlaps partly with both PIDER 1 and PIDER&#13;
II projecta) about 83.3 percent of the investment costs of local productive&#13;
projects was funded through PIDER from public funda, while beneficiaries&#13;
directly contributed 5.6 percent of the costa and assumed credits for an&#13;
additional 11.1 percent. The same atatistics indicate that for production&#13;
support projects the beneficiaries directly contributed 3.8 percent of the&#13;
costs, while for social infrastructural projects they contributed 11.6&#13;
percent.&#13;
1/ In 1978, a mid-term evaluation of PIDER I was carried out jointly by&#13;
CIDER/PIDER and the World Bank; in 1982, the Project Completion Report on&#13;
PIDER I was concluded; in early 1983, the performance audit report for&#13;
the project was drafted. The information in this section draws largely&#13;
on these sources.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
Overall, PIDER I was more successful in completing the physical&#13;
construction of investments than in ensuring their subsequent operation and&#13;
in reaching their expected productivity. Unit costs appear to have&#13;
frequently exceeded appraisal forecasts. Due to poor planning or inadequate&#13;
technical supervision, as well as to contractor inefficiency, works were&#13;
sometimes of substandard quality or were incomplete in some fundamental&#13;
aspect, and many were initiated or redone several times. A good number of&#13;
the completed productive investments are not operating, largely because the&#13;
prior organizing of intended beneficiaries for taking over and operating the&#13;
new assets was not done. Thus, despite some outstanding project successes,&#13;
overall economic benefits from PIDER I and II direct investments in&#13;
productive activities appear to be below those anticipated.&#13;
Comparatively better results were achieved with the social and&#13;
productive support investments than with the productive ínvestments. Rural&#13;
roads, rural electrification, and school classroom investments were&#13;
successfully implemented, and nearly all such investments are operating.&#13;
Most drinking water systems were also successfully completed, although&#13;
operation and maintenance is a serious problem in about one-fourth of the&#13;
communities.&#13;
From among the wide spectrum of productive investments, irrigation&#13;
provided the highest returns and greatest permanent employment. Many&#13;
successful small-scale irrigation systems have dramatically increased&#13;
beneficiary incomes. Water resources have been identified in rainfed&#13;
cultivation areas. Nonetheless, the successes were checkered by other&#13;
failures. Investments were frequently left incomplete for several years due&#13;
to poor investment coordination; wells were drilled which produced&#13;
insufficient water to justify economically the distribution works&#13;
constructed; water pumps failed from poor quality or improper use; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
beneficiaries often lacked the experience and training in both irrigation and&#13;
cropping techniques to achieve their investment's potential.&#13;
A significant proportion of livestock investmenta (beef, dairy,&#13;
pigs, and poultry) were unsuccessful due to faulty technical design, producer&#13;
inexperience, inadequate technical assistance, social conflicte, and&#13;
marketing difficulties. Fruit crop investments suffered from poor assessment&#13;
of technical packages, including improper choice of species. A significant&#13;
proportion of planted trees have been lost from lack of producer skills or&#13;
care during the dry season. Many of the soil and water conservation projects&#13;
were poorly designed, having little or no production impact, while others&#13;
were badly damaged after completion when beneficiaries, failing to understand&#13;
the economic importance of the projects, did not provide maintenance. The&#13;
worst results were achieved with terrace and border construction, gully dams,&#13;
and catcbment basins. The technical design errora commited by technical&#13;
agencies on PIDER in preparing, assessing or executing such projects have a&#13;
strong adverse effect on people's willingness and confidence to participate&#13;
in further projects.&#13;
Great variability thus exists in the impact achieved, both by type&#13;
of investment and by geographical region. Where investments were successful,&#13;
the socioeconomic impact of these projects, particularly when combined with&#13;
social and productive support investments, is encouraging. Permanent&#13;
employment and income for many beneficiary groups rose significantly and&#13;
became more stable. Poor farmers did benefit from project investments even&#13;
when the economic returns were then low, because investments were heavily&#13;
subsidized from public funds. Beneficiary and ejido organizations were often&#13;
strengthened and frequently became more democratic. The availability of good&#13;
drinking water, electricity (lights, TV, and refrigerators), amall home&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
improvements, provision of grade-school education, improved roads,&#13;
establishment of new stores, and access to health facilities -- all much&#13;
improved the quality of life. There are indications that many beneficiaries&#13;
from successful PIDER enterprises invest a high proportion of their income&#13;
gains in other, frequently collective undertakings. Nonetheless, the costs&#13;
of achievements are too high, and this is among PIDER's main failings.&#13;
The evaluations carried out to date also signal that, besides its&#13;
physical impact, PIDER I generated a series of intangible (or tangible but&#13;
unquantifiable) benefits of an institutional, distributional, learning, and&#13;
attitudinal nature. 1/ Although not reflected in the rather low economic&#13;
rates of return of various individual investments, these benefits&#13;
significantly raise the project's overall contribution. For instance, Mexico&#13;
had little or no experience with broad-scale rural development interventions&#13;
in rainfed areas with small farmers. PIDER provided a large scale, varied&#13;
(and costly) working experiment. Much has been learned, both about what to&#13;
do and not to do. PIDER I and II have resulted in substantial staff&#13;
training; in major improvements in planning, budgeting, and evaluation&#13;
mechanisms within Mexican public administration; in the identification of&#13;
many technical problems (rainfed agricultural technology, delivery of&#13;
technical assistance, ejidatario organization) and the solution of a few. An&#13;
increased appreciation of the importance of investing in human resources as&#13;
opposed to mere physical investment emerged as well. The weaknesses of many&#13;
federal agency procedures and practices also became clearer.&#13;
PIDER activities also induced substantial attitudinal changes&#13;
related to the development lessons learned. The project encouraged positive&#13;

strongly emphasized such noneconomic benefits among his field findings,&#13;
some of which are reflected here (personal communication).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
attitudes and reorientation among government officials and staff (both&#13;
federal and state) regardíng the goals of rural development. Ejidatarios&#13;
have been encouraged to assume positive expectations regard- ing their&#13;
entitlements and the government activities which affect them, regarding their&#13;
own productive potential, aud regarding their capacity to affect ejido&#13;
organization and leadership. Stronger ejido organizatíon has been gradually&#13;
encouraged. At the institutional level, PIDER increased coordination and&#13;
cooperation among federal agencies ín planning and implementíng. Although&#13;
there has been substantial bureaucratic resistance, cooperation is now&#13;
improved. The decentralization of decision-making to the state and local&#13;
level, including a strengthening of state and local governnent administrative&#13;
capacity, has been considerably advanced. Such effects are difficult to&#13;
measure, but they are important.&#13;
All these changes notwithstanding, it should be recognized that,&#13;
besides technical and management problems, there were also many social or&#13;
organizational shortfalls which have contributed to the ineffectiveness, or&#13;
outright failure, of some local (productive and social) investnents.&#13;
Preoccupation with achieving rapid production increases led PIDER and the&#13;
implementing agencies to inítiate construction of productive works in many&#13;
communities where only partial support and understanding of the project had&#13;
previously been obtained from the ejido. Beneficiaries in these cases often&#13;
took a passive, skeptical view of investments, and the technical agencies had&#13;
to continue to control the productive works after completion. Such failures&#13;
pointed out again that economic effectiveness of local investments can hardly&#13;
be achíeved in the absence of active partícipation of beneficiaríes.&#13;
A recurrent weakness in PIDER's work at the mícroregional level was&#13;
its lack of concern with creating the "software" for the new physical assets&#13;
(be they small irrigation schemes or cattle units) funded through the&#13;

the productive assets. Absorption of new technologies, or new production&#13;
means, requires new and adequate social organization of the farmers, 1/ but&#13;
PIDER I did not provide the required social engineering assistance for this&#13;
part of the development process. 2/&#13;
Also, usually only a small fraction of the ejido members were&#13;
beneficiaries of specific projects because the investment provided too little&#13;
permanent employment or income to permit participation by all, while no&#13;
distributory mechanism for the ejido as a whole was put in place. Small&#13;
groups were often the only viable organizational means to proceed, but these&#13;
occasionally led to monopolization of the benefits by a few (using collective&#13;
resources) or to serious internal conflicts in the ejido.&#13;
In hindsight, the problems mentioned above, which occurred&#13;
repeatedly during the early PIDER years before the participatory approach was&#13;
evolved, are just one more factual confirmation that insufficient farmer&#13;
participation in selecting-or operating local investments can only diminish&#13;
or annihilate their development impact. They reconfirm the correctness of&#13;
the orientation toward changing the programming systems. And they are a&#13;
strong reminder of the kind of consequences that can be expected in the&#13;
future, if participation of local beneficiaries will not be consistently&#13;

by groups, not individually.&#13;

expanded. This conclusion, and its validity for the future of PIDER, was&#13;
probably best formulated in the PAPCO methodological study:&#13;
PIDER experience shows that, without active participation of&#13;
beneficiaries, projects in the communities do not achieve planned&#13;
objectives and targets and, in the best of cases, operate poorly. In&#13;
addition to being a waste of available resources, such poor results cause&#13;
the communities to become discouraged and to lose interest and confidence&#13;
in the efforts of government agencies to benefit them. Community&#13;
passivity also compromises the objectives of PIDER: if beneficiaries are&#13;
not involved in projects, the Program will do no more than build works and&#13;
will make no contribution to promoting the self-sustaining development&#13;
required to ensure that community members attain a more decent standard of&#13;
living. 1/&#13;

VII. CONSTRAINTS ON FARMERS' PARTICIPATION&#13;
The attractiveness of PIDER's social methodology for promotíng&#13;
community participation may easily lead to overstatements about either&#13;
the degree of partícipation already achíeved in this program or about the&#13;
very feasibility of community participation in investment planning in&#13;
general. More caution is certainly required. More empirical evidence&#13;
has yet to come in, and more time has to pass, for the new approaches to&#13;
settle in and prove themselves as sustainable beyond the initial&#13;
momentum. Rowever, the experience already accumulated in Mexico in both&#13;
the production of a participatory methodology and in ita introduction&#13;
allows some of the more dífficult questions regarding participation to be&#13;
raised and some of the structural and practical constraints on promoting&#13;
participation to be pointed out.&#13;
1. The Bureaucratic Leviathan*)&#13;
Among rural development projects assisted by the World Bank,&#13;
PIDER atanda out as one of the most systematically concerned with&#13;
participation. Withín Mexico itself, compared to other large scale&#13;
development programs, PIDER has achieved by and large a much higher&#13;
degree of participation than the "regular" or "normal" programs, and this&#13;
is quite significant. Nevertheless, despite the large-scale efforts and&#13;
the undeniable achievements obtained, past and recent participation&#13;
experience in PIDER itself teaches some sober lessons in realism.&#13;
The availability of a model, or of many manuals, for&#13;
participation should not be confused with the reality of participatory&#13;
*) "Leviathanr is the name of a mythical, giant marine animal, that was&#13;
used by the political philosopher Thomas Hobbes as a metaphor for the&#13;
sovereign atate and the state machinery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
programming. The implementation of participatory programning confronts&#13;
multiple sociopolitical and bureaucratic constraints and technical and&#13;
cultural difficulties. To expand further, it will require continuous&#13;
effort, firm political and managerial endorsement of adopted guidelines,&#13;
and constant supervision and reinforcement.&#13;
By definition, the methodology for participation describes and&#13;
prescribes the way toward the ideally desired model. For giving reality&#13;
to the ideal, however, a lucid understanding of the potential and actual&#13;
obstacles is required. Only in this way can these obstacles be&#13;
confronted pragmatically and systematically, in the very process of&#13;
translating the methodology into practice.&#13;
To begin with, constraints are inherent in the very body and&#13;
routines of the huge bureaucratic-technical apparatus. IThe bureaucratic&#13;
leviathan is not easy to turn around. Not only in Mexico, but in any&#13;
country, this apparatus is reluctant to effect a major change for&#13;
internalízing and practicing new models. Obstacles against participation&#13;
abound; they range from institutional to sociocultural, to technical, to&#13;
logistical, and so on and are spread over a seemingly endless spectrum.&#13;
They are to be confronted in every agency; they are likely to be&#13;
recurrent, not to disappear just after one successful "first round."&#13;
Therefore, while it is essential to press for and to encourage the&#13;
reorientation of the bureaucracy, the realistic social analyst should not&#13;
overestimate what can be achieved along this approach at the "opportunity&#13;
cost" of other efforts. As was correctly observed, "fínding ways of&#13;
inculcating the spirit of experimentation and creativity into&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
hierarchical and control-oriented bureaucracies has eluded most&#13;
administrative reformers." 1/&#13;
In any social program -- and PIDER confirms this generalization&#13;
-- the innovative elements are among its most vulnerable parts. Not&#13;
unexpectedly, therefore, the constraints faced by PIDER's drive for more&#13;
participation made themselves felt primarily in connection with the most&#13;
innovative (but vulnerable) parts of the new social methodology for&#13;
investment selection.&#13;
Let us examine, for instance, the novel element of involving the&#13;
planners and technicians themselves in action research at the community&#13;
level, in diagnostics of needs and field assessments of the fit between&#13;
perceived needs and available resources. As was explained in Chapter&#13;
III, the participatory methodology asks the technical personnel to start&#13;
program design by going out within the target communities. This ie&#13;
fundamentally different from other participation-eliciting strategies (in&#13;
Mexico or other countries), ín which activating the community is the&#13;
distinct responsibility of some social extension agents, while the&#13;
planners and technicians do "business as usual" in their city offices and&#13;
are supplied with "proposals from below" to which they personally have&#13;
little commitment. But this also means that participatory programming is&#13;
not an operation free of incremental costs. It requires more staff time&#13;
for the diagnosis phase than conventional top-down planning and clearly&#13;
costlier logistical means. If participation is to be expanded, such&#13;
costs should be assumed; so far, PIDER has been prepared financially to&#13;

Politics. vol. 35, no. 1 (1982).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
support its participatory drive, but not all agencies took the same&#13;
position. Therefore, this particular segment of the methodology -- the&#13;
field diagnosis -- appears vulnerable to real or claimed staff&#13;
constraints, to short-sighted cost-benefit arguments, or to time and&#13;
expediency counterreasoning.&#13;
The technical agencies were often reluctant, despite SPP's&#13;
insistence, to dispatch their planners and technicians to the target&#13;
villages for weeks. This was visible, for instance, during the appraisal&#13;
process of the PIDER III project, when the first eight microregions 1/ in&#13;
four different states covered by the project had to be entirely&#13;
programmed based on the new methodology. It became then obvious how lack&#13;
of sufficient technical staff during the diagnostic phase limits the&#13;
possibility of in-depth exploration of the population's social structure,&#13;
needs, and potential.&#13;
Insufficient staff, or delays in the start of programming, may&#13;
make the schedule of field work so tight as to squeeze out from the&#13;
sequence of programming activities precisely these steps which involve&#13;
detailed work with people but are time consuming. 2/ Compromises in&#13;
applying the participatory methodology and departures from it are often&#13;
rationalized as reflecting planners' "maturity," their "appreciation" of&#13;
1/ The eight that were appraised: Mocorito-Badiraguato and Norte in the&#13;
State of Sinaloa; Valparaiso and Tlaltenango in the State of&#13;
Zacatecas; Costa Chica and Atoyac in the State of Guerrero; and&#13;
Litoral Norte and Sur in the State of Yucatan. The plans for the&#13;
remaining nine microregions covered by PIDER III have been appraised&#13;
subsequently in a gradual manner. They are: Cosala-Elota and Sur in&#13;
the State of Sinaloa; Rio Grande, Fresnillo-Calera, and Pinos in the&#13;
State of Zacatecas; Oriente in the State of Yucatan; and Costa&#13;
Grande, Ometepac, and Cuauhtemoc in the State of Guerrero.&#13;

requirements for planning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
practical and political realities, or their more "realistic" assessment&#13;
of the nature of the problem. But these rationalizationa often only&#13;
cover the reluctance to go off the beaten path in planning and are not&#13;
justified.&#13;
The concerns of line agencies with expediency and short-term&#13;
efficiency are often dealt with at the expense of participation, rather&#13;
than through other ways for expediting and streamlining. Sometimes,&#13;
agencies or civil work contractors for PIDER local projects have rejected&#13;
direct work participation of peasants under the "justification" that work&#13;
with outside crews goes faster. Thus, participatory programming is&#13;
pitted against many entrenched routines of the technical or planning&#13;
agencies.&#13;
The reorientation of the bureaucracy also runs into difficulties&#13;
stemming from old bureaucratic habits. Not rarely, planners going into&#13;
villages to identify investment opportunities tend to meet only with the&#13;
community leaders and/or to present, rather than discuss, PIDER&#13;
proposals. It was basically to this kind of distortion that PIDER&#13;
reacted by preparing in 1982 the additional PAPCO Manual for supporting&#13;
community participation through systematic information and motivation, 1/&#13;
intended to give specific guidance for carrying out the interaction and&#13;
dialogue between the communities and various technicians or plannere.&#13;
Vested interests that feel threatened by loss of control over&#13;
resource allocation use eíther "philosophical" or economic (cost-benefit)&#13;
arguments in an attempt to undermine the credibility of, and support for,&#13;
the participatory approach. While occasionally there are indeed&#13;
1/ "Manual del programa de apoyo a la participation de la comunidad&#13;
rural" (Mexico, D.F.: SPP, 1982).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
incremental costs for organizing participation, the cost-benefit argument&#13;
against assuming the extra efforts is in no way valid. True, the&#13;
economic benefits of popular participation in local investment selection&#13;
and execution do not often lend themselves to easy measurement. Many&#13;
benefits will remain "invisible": we will never know the number of&#13;
unsuitable projects which have not been included due to the peasants'&#13;
participation, and the amount of money thus saved. The projects proposed&#13;
by grass-roots communities may not always be highly successful, but many&#13;
inadequate investments are definitely screened out by the farmers' sense&#13;
of workability and priority. The opportunity cost of not involving the&#13;
peasants is unaffordable, since the alternative is likely to be repeated&#13;
failure and underutilization of the financial resources committed.&#13;
Cultural constraints to promoting participation are often&#13;
overlooked, but they are nonetheless a major slowíng factor. A specific&#13;
expression of such cultural constraints is the value systems of the army&#13;
of technicians, planners, bureaucrats, and others who, in the case of&#13;
PIDER, are called upon to embrace a new style of planning and interact&#13;
with new (for them) clients. There is an implicit, yet not necessarily&#13;
correct, assumption that underlies PIDER's participatory methodology:&#13;
namely, that the individual technicians and planners involved in&#13;
community diagnosis would voluntarily behave as change agents in the&#13;
context of PIDER. To what extent is that assumption warranted? Do all&#13;
the technicians and planners have the adequate motivation and dedication&#13;
to promote social change? While a set of more democratic procedures can&#13;
be instituted by administrative decision, the conceptual underpinnings&#13;
for such procedures are not automatícally assimilated by the civil&#13;
servante or technicians who have to apply the new procedures. The values&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
and loyalties of civil servants and technicians are often of a different&#13;
order than those required by participatory dec.ision-making.&#13;
PIDER is addressing this inherent limitation by providing&#13;
training for participatory programming to staff of executing agencies.&#13;
Realism and actual experience, however, suggest that this limitation&#13;
cannot be removed by training alone. To be sure, staff training is&#13;
important in reorienting the bureaucracy and in learning the lessons of&#13;
experience. But agency leadership and the firmness with which the new&#13;
approach is being enforced and monitored by PIDER management are critical&#13;
variables as well. 1/ Over the last six to eight years PIDER had several&#13;
top management teams, and this rapid succession has affected the&#13;
continuity and consistency of the drive for fostering the implementation&#13;
of the new methodology.&#13;
Constraints arise sometimes also out of conflicts between PIDER&#13;
aud the other agencies who are at work in the same communities.  In&#13;
Quintana Roo, for instance, problems developed over the type of compen-&#13;
sation given to labor on community projects. 2/ PIDER found that&#13;

of comnitment to the project among the community and saved on labor&#13;
costs. 1/ The existence of conflicting strategies within a single&#13;
community is, however, counterproductive.&#13;
2. The Contextual Limitations&#13;
Participation ín investment decision-making and execution is most&#13;
often politically sensitive. The allocation of investments does not occur&#13;
in Mexico within a political vacuum -- on the contrary, it takes place&#13;
within a highly politicized environment. Openly or surreptitiously,&#13;
groups with vested interests are likely to oppose the involvement of the&#13;
poor, marginal, and small peasants in the decision-making and priority-&#13;
setting processes at community levels. While introducing participatory&#13;
programming is, in substance, an attempt to empower the local communities&#13;
and to transfer some authority over resource allocation to groups formerly&#13;
deprived of such authority, the overall power structures and authority&#13;
systems in the Mexican countryside remain the same. They are beyond&#13;
PIDER's reach and objectives for change. Therefore, popular partici-&#13;
pation in investment selection and execution will operate under the&#13;
constraints of existing rural political structures.&#13;
One can hardly see how a certain development program could&#13;
accomplish systematic participation of the contextual factors, local and&#13;
macrosocial, if the national government 1s not willing to pursue and to&#13;

Implementation among Indigenous Groups," 1978, mimeo.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
support this orientation. The implementation of the methodology in the&#13;
future will remain context-sensitive vis-a-vis the changes in the overall&#13;
political clímate of the Mexican society.&#13;
Participation of peasants in investment decision-making is also&#13;
limited by the low level of group awareness that many peasants have of&#13;
their own situation. This level varíes in Mexico from one area to&#13;
another, from one ethnic group to another. The village elites tend to&#13;
control the contacts between the poorest village groups and the PIDER&#13;
planners. Often, the weaker segments of the peasant population are either&#13;
not willing, or not able, to engage in some confrontation with the rural&#13;
elites over priorities in investment selection. Thus, the preparedness of&#13;
PIDER target groups to respond to the participatory development process is&#13;
by far not identical in all microregions.&#13;
3. The Need for Farmer Organizations&#13;
One of the vulnerabilities of the participatory methodology&#13;
results, in our view, from the fact that it is not in a position to rely&#13;
on stable forms of peasant self-organization, which would mobilize and&#13;
sustain the active involvement of peasant groups in development&#13;
activities. The community meetings organized by PIDER programming teams&#13;
with various segmento of the village population are a useful but&#13;
short-lived, transitory form of group action. Between the meetings that&#13;
take part in the diagnostic stage and those in the final programming&#13;
stage, there is no permanent structure of group action generated by PIDER&#13;
in the target communities. The social structure that emerges in the&#13;
process of interaction between the planners and the local community is not&#13;
maintained and sustained after the field team departs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
Little work has been done to identify the pattern of peasant&#13;
organization which could best interact with implementing agencies and&#13;
which would provide an effective structure for operating and maintaining&#13;
projects. Existing indigenous organization or village subgroup structures&#13;
tend to be more effective in carrying out projects than dynamic, but&#13;
usually isolated, individuals (if the individuals' efforts are not&#13;
coordinated and structured). 1/ Sometimes the presence of well-trained&#13;
and sensitive extension agents, who respect the experiences and knowledge&#13;
of the community members, may be the catalyst for group action, as opposed&#13;
to "atomized participation" of individuals from the given community.&#13;
Community participatíon must be self-perpetuating, not dependent&#13;
on visits by outsiders. Where ejido-based groups do exist and act&#13;
collectively, this may be less of a problem. But, to sustain&#13;
participation in the long run, PIDER should explore ways to help build&#13;
more stable social-organizational structures within the peasant&#13;
communities. Such structures would be a powerful means both for fostering&#13;
peasants' parti- cipation in-government-sponsored actions and for&#13;
supporting peasant group organization for more assertive productive and&#13;
marketing activities.&#13;

VIII. FURTHER EXPANSION OF PARTICIPATION IN PIDER&#13;
Further expansion of the participatory approach from the&#13;
programming phase to other PIDER activities should follow the logical&#13;
sequence of the project cycle, with special emphasis on implementation.&#13;
Such expansion, however, would depend primarily on whether the provisions&#13;
for participation in programming are indeed carried out consistently.&#13;
1. Training and Staffing for Participatíon&#13;
PIDER management at federal and state levels should combine the&#13;
firm stand in enforcing the participatory methodology with additional&#13;
efforts for staff training. Overall, PIDER's emphasis on staff training&#13;
has weakened in the last two to three years compared with previous years.&#13;
Supplementary programa of seminars and short-term training courses should&#13;
be set up for all levels of PIDER and agency staff, to help modify&#13;
long-established routines of thought and behavior and to motivate for&#13;
participation.&#13;
Under the PIDER III project, significant financing is provided&#13;
for a continuous staff training program on participation issues. Several&#13;
types of training programs are envisaged: short seminars for PIDER and&#13;
líne agency staff, including managers, on the programming methodology; and&#13;
longer-duration training courses (from two weeks to three months) for&#13;
personnel directly involved in the preparation and analysis of productive&#13;
projecta, of feasibility reports, etc. As provided for in the project,&#13;
"these seminars would combine the discussion of normative conceptual&#13;
elements (e.g., theoretical foundation of the programming methodology)&#13;
with the analysis or evaluation of micro-regional cases based&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -&#13;
on staff's experience with the PIDER program.' 1/ Developing case studies&#13;
from PIDER's own experience to be used in training -- to make training&#13;
less didactic and more oriented to problem-solving and to buílding needed&#13;
organizational capacity--might help. Material and social incentives for&#13;
staff promoting participation should complement training.&#13;
The staffing of the programming field teams should reach a better&#13;
balance between technical experts and staff with skills in community&#13;
organization. Currently, technical experts are sometimes left alone in&#13;
the field without adequate advice for addressing the sociocultural aspects&#13;
of field work. Including sociologists and anthropologists in field teams&#13;
may help reveal felt needs at the local level. The kind of social&#13;
engineering skills used in the initial stages of designing and testing the&#13;
particular methodology are even more necessary in the process of&#13;
implementing it on a larger social scale.&#13;
2. Participation beyond Programming&#13;
Promoting participation is a proceas, not a finite, time limited,&#13;
task. To strengthen, accelerate, and broaden this process during the mid&#13;
and late 1980s, PIDER has to pursue two main lines tenaciously:&#13;
(a) constant implementation of the participation procedures, enacted so&#13;
far, at the state and microregional levels and (b) further refinement and&#13;
elaboration of the methodology itself through learning from, and self&#13;
critical assessment of, ongoing development activities.&#13;
It is encouraging that the new, post election management team of&#13;
PIDER plans to pursue strongly the participatory approach and that the&#13;
official concern and responsibility for beneficiaries participation has&#13;
1/ World Bank appraisal materials for the PIDER III Integrated Rural&#13;
Development Project, 1981.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
been strengthened through the recent modifications oftthe country's&#13;
Constitution. PIDER's case is typical for the situation in which the&#13;
international agency supporting the project can only strongly encourage&#13;
participatory approaches in various ways, but can do little more, given&#13;
that the country's political and social structures, and the project's&#13;
organizational set-up, ultimately have the determining role. It is up to&#13;
SPP and PIDER management and staff to identify and address the cultural&#13;
and political difficulties hampering participation and to design and&#13;
implement solutions which can be effective within the Mexican social&#13;
structures.&#13;
Following the last elections, the staff turnover in SPP and&#13;
PIDER was very substantial. Many key managers have moved to other&#13;
positions. The new staff is visibly younger and has less direct knowledge&#13;
of PIDER history and past implementation issues. PIDER's institutional&#13;
memory has suffered as a result of the high staff turnover. The "personal&#13;
memory` of the current staff cannot function as a repository of PIDER's&#13;
institutional experience, and this makes the study of the participatory&#13;
methodology and manuals by the new staff an immediate and paramount task.&#13;
The fate of the participatory approach will depend to a&#13;
significant extent on SPP's firmness and ability to exercise leadership in&#13;
enforcing the methodology as the routine, daily work-manner, and in&#13;
guiding the state governments and agencies to systematically implement&#13;
procedures that could increase beneficiaries' role in every stage of the&#13;
project cycle. SPP may also carry out focused evaluation exercises and&#13;
studies on the degree of participation achieved in various PIDER&#13;
operations, to detect and address the shortcomings and distortions in the&#13;
application of the participatory approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 99 _&#13;
The guidelines for beneficiary participation in PIDER are now&#13;
scattered in several manuals, each one describing a different aspect.&#13;
There is unevenness between the good quality of guidelines for involving&#13;
beneficiaries in investment identification at community level and the&#13;
quality of the guidelines for organizing participation in implementation&#13;
and monitoring. The new Directorate of PIDER is considering preparing a&#13;
synthesis document with the essential recommendations for organizing&#13;
participation along each of the stages of the project cycle. 1/ This will&#13;
offer a handy and operational piece to all PIDER staff, now overwhelmed&#13;
with many manuals.&#13;
The methodology itself should be continuously improved and made&#13;
more operational in both its social and technical aspects. More guidance&#13;
is necessary on how to proceed from identified problema and development&#13;
constraints in target communities toward solutions based on the proposed&#13;
investments. At various levels of the PIDER administrative apparatus, as&#13;
well as ín many cooperating agencies, there is a growing awareness of the&#13;
need for the patient working out and field testing of methodologies for&#13;
beneficiaries' involvement in the implementation and execution of specific&#13;
types of projects. Alternative forms of participation should be&#13;
considered, experimented with, and evaluated.&#13;
There is wide agreement that PIDER's community projecta have been&#13;
wasteful in terms of cost overruns, uncompleted projects, or "completed"&#13;
but unusable projects. The most efficient way to curb this waste ¡a to&#13;
assure the participation of beneficiary communities in monitoring the real&#13;

not leaving the officials to do monitoring alone. In addition,&#13;
participation of beneficiaries is the only solution to the recurrent costs&#13;
problems, which is a long-term issue; it entails involving beneficiaries&#13;
in executing and monitoring projects as a preliminary step to taking over&#13;
and operating the new infrastructural assets, with community maintenance&#13;
and cost responsibility. These segments of PIDER's participation&#13;
methodology have been among the least worked out, despite the big number&#13;
of recent manuals.&#13;
Another area for which participation is of vital importance is&#13;
the operation and maintenance of completed PIDER investments. Many&#13;
village projects have shown that the development impact of the completed&#13;
investments is often curtailed because of the absence or non-involvement&#13;
of local organizational and social structures ready to take responsibility&#13;
for operating the new assets and for mobilizing communities in maintaining&#13;
them in operating condition.&#13;
Within the internal logic of PIDER's own expansion, the time has&#13;
certainly arrived to address these tasks in much more systematic manner.&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
PIDER I AND PIDER II PROJECTS: BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS&#13;
PIDER was developed as a program to coordinate and focus the&#13;
rural development efforts in the most needy areas of Mexico with a high&#13;
concentration of rural poor.&#13;
In May 1975, a loan for US$110 million was approved by the World&#13;
Bank to assist activities in thirty microregions under the PIDER I Rural&#13;
Development Project, of which the total cost was US$295 million.&#13;
After the first two years of implementing the PIDER I project, a&#13;
new World Bank credit of US$120 million was granted to Mexico for the&#13;
PIDER program, under the PIDER II Rural Development Project.  This&#13;
extended World Bank financial assistance to fifty PIDER microregione.&#13;
PIDER's strategy guidelines for implementing these investments&#13;
and for achieving ita poverty alleviation objectives can be summarized as&#13;
follows:&#13;
o    The program should operate as a new, institutionalized mechanism&#13;
(but not as yet another agency) which brings the various public&#13;
sector agencies that funetion in the rural sector together in&#13;
coordinated action.&#13;
o    It should be implemented within a regional framework, so as to&#13;
concentrate its activities within a well-defined radius, thereby&#13;
promoting the development of regionally integrated groups of&#13;
communities, rather than the isolated development of each&#13;
individual community.&#13;
o    Preference ought to be given to the poorest regions and&#13;
localities that possess potential resources but lack productive&#13;
and support services and social infrastructures.&#13;
O    The investments under the program should be assembled into a&#13;
medium-term regional development (which would apply to both PIDER&#13;
and non-PIDER activities) and into annual plans for each region.&#13;
O    The programs would comprise directly productive and support works&#13;
and services, and social infrastructure projects, with the&#13;
directly productive category receiving the largest share of total&#13;
financial resources.&#13;
O    Village and ejido participation in the planning and execution&#13;
procesa ahould be promoted.&#13;
O    Planning and especially execution should be gradually&#13;
decentralized to the state and local levels, integrating locally&#13;
the activities of existing line departments; specific allocations&#13;
would be made to atate levels from central government funda, in&#13;
order to finance approved programa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
Within these broad strategic guidelines, investments in PIDER I&#13;
were allocated to the major three types of project-supported activities,&#13;
in the following manner:&#13;
o    Directly Productive Investments (66%), through the provision of&#13;
farm develoment credit (29.6%) for beef, dairy cattle and other&#13;
livestock purchases, rainfed grain farming, and beekeeping, fruit&#13;
production development (4.9%), improved lívestock production (10%&#13;
for land clearing, fencing and stock handling yards), irrigation&#13;
development and rehabilitation (17%) and soil and water&#13;
conservation (4.9%)&#13;
o    Productive Support Investments (22%), through financing improved&#13;
extension services, market and store construction,&#13;
electrífication and improved training; the project is also&#13;
assisting in speeding up clearance of land titles to newly&#13;
established ejidos and support technical services íncluding&#13;
agricultural research at federal, state, and village levels&#13;
o    Social Infrastructure (12%), by the provision of improved&#13;
drinking water supplies, materials for self-help village&#13;
improvement projects, construction of primary schools and limited&#13;
rural health facilities.&#13;
The scope of the PIDER II project generally followed the pattern&#13;
of support given by PIDER I, with the addition of a rural industry&#13;
component (7% of productive investments):&#13;
o    Out of the total PIDER II cost of US$255 million, about 70%&#13;
finances directly productive investments including farm&#13;
development credit (24%), irrigation (16%), livestock development&#13;
(8%), soil and water conservation (5%), and fruit, forestry, and&#13;
fishery production (4%). The irrigation component would develop&#13;
about 34,000 ha of irrigated land and is expected to benefit some&#13;
14,000 families, while the livestock investment would support&#13;
livestock development on some 500 ejidos.&#13;
O    Productive support activities, totaling about 20% of the PIDER II&#13;
project cost, have been included to reinforce improvements in&#13;
agrarian reform and farmer organization (3%); extension services,&#13;
including field demonstrations (about 5%); feeder roads (7%);&#13;
rural electrífication (3%); marketing and store construction.&#13;
O    Another 10% of project investments have been provided for social&#13;
infrastructure, including improved drinking vater supplies,&#13;
materials for self-help village improvement projects, and primary&#13;
schools construction. In addition, PIDER II has financed CIDER&#13;
evaluation activities, as well as the staff training carried out&#13;
under CIDER auspices.&#13;

ANNEX II&#13;
SUMMARY OF THE PIDER III INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
In 1981, The World Bank approved a third loan (US$175 million)&#13;
for a new "slíce" of the PIDER program, which was conventionally called&#13;
the PIDER III project. It consists of various rural development&#13;
investments planned for seventeen microregions located in four states of&#13;
Mexico: Sinaloa, Zacateas, Yucatan, and Guerrero.&#13;
Based on the experiences gained from PIDER 1 and II, the main&#13;
objective of the new project ís to increase the development impact of the&#13;
ongoíng PIDER rural development program through actions designed to: (a)&#13;
improve microregional investment planing; (b) increase beneficiary&#13;
participation ín the program planning, execution, and evaluatíon stages&#13;
and in the operation and maintenance of infrastructure; (c) increase&#13;
effectiveness of extension, credit, and farmer organization; (d) conduct&#13;
feasibility studies for productive investments and for applied research;&#13;
(e) provide training and specialized technical assistance; and (f) improve&#13;
the monitoring and evaluation system.&#13;
The project seeks to increase the productivity, incomes, and&#13;
living standards of poor rural families. Approximately US$22.5 million of&#13;
the proposed loan would be on-lent to small farmers for on-farm&#13;
investments and rural industries development.&#13;
Qn the whole, PIDER III finances the same types of activities as&#13;
did PIDER I and II. However, two new components have been added&#13;
(Productíve Programs for Women and Nutrition) and two important ongoing&#13;
components (Livestock and Agricultural Development) have been&#13;
signifícantly 8trengthened.&#13;
PIDER III investments are being distributed among the following&#13;
activities:&#13;
o    Directly Productive Components (61% of project cost). like:&#13;
small-scale irrigation; soil and water conservation; crop,&#13;
livestock, and beekeeping development programa; reforestation and&#13;
afforestation; fisheries; rural industries; and medium-term&#13;
development credit&#13;
a    Productive Support Components (26% of project cost), like:&#13;
extension services; applied research in support of the extension&#13;
program; rural marketing facilities; organization of farmer&#13;
groups and support of land-titling programs; construction,&#13;
rehabilitation, and maintenance of rural roads; rural&#13;
electrification; a program to generate productive employment&#13;
opportunities for rural women; and feasibility studies for&#13;
productive investments&#13;
a    Social Infrastructure (10% of project cost), like:  Primary&#13;
schools and boarding facilities; rural health clinics; a pilot&#13;
nutrition program; village water supply systems; and village&#13;
self-help programs for community improvement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -&#13;
o    Management (3% of project cost), including:  monitoring,&#13;
evaluation, staff training.&#13;
Tbe PIDER III Project ¡s targeted to benefit some 250,000&#13;
families in the seventeen microregions.  About 46,000 families are&#13;
expected to benefit from the directly productive investments under the&#13;
projects.&#13;
The difficult economie situation confronting the country, and the&#13;
budgetary restrictions instituted by the Governuent, have affected the&#13;
implementation of PIDER III.  The loan signed in November 1981 was for a&#13;
total of US$175 million, to be disbursed over three years. However,&#13;
because of country difficulties, only US$15 million (8.6%) have been&#13;
utilized until March 1983; therfore, a set of changes have been envisaged&#13;
to facilitate the use of project funde, including an extension of the&#13;
overall implementation period for PIDER III beyond 1984.&#13;

Manuala and Guidelines on Participation in PIDER(Annotated)&#13;
The procedural Manuals and Guidelines developed by PIDER as part&#13;
of the methodology for community participation, which were discussed in&#13;
the main body of this paper, are lísted and annotated below.&#13;
While created specifically for the PIDER projecta under Mexico's&#13;
circumstances, these Manuals crystallize social experieuce that, in&#13;
certain respects, may have important transfer value for other national&#13;
contexts. By standardizing the critical indices which need to be&#13;
identified for community diagnosis, information, and involvement, the&#13;
Manuals may be useful for planners, middle-level managers, and social&#13;
acientists who design and implement rural development programs in various&#13;
countries -- obviously, with appropriate adaptations to the different&#13;
contexto.&#13;
The annotations explain briefly the content of .recent manuals.&#13;
The Manuals are available (in Spanish) from: S.P.P., Direccion de Enlace&#13;
y Evaluacion de Programas de Desarrollo Regional; and S.P.P., Direccion&#13;
del Programa Integral para el Desarrollo Rural -- PIDER (address: Jose&#13;
Maria Izazaga 38, Mexico D.F., Mexico).&#13;
1. `Manual del programa de apoyo a la participacion de la comunidad&#13;
rural" (Guidelines for the Support Program for Rural Community&#13;
Participation) (1982).&#13;
The guidelines define the types of information to be&#13;
communicated to farmers during each of the three programming&#13;
phases -- (1) informing and motivating the beneficiaries (2)&#13;
organizing the work groups, and (3) training the participanta.&#13;
Procedures are given for establishing a dialogue between&#13;
communities and project staff: using audio-visual materials,&#13;
humor, tact; how to approach different social groups in the same&#13;
village; how to solicit questiona and response.&#13;
2.  `Manual del programa de analisis socioeconomico de la comunidad&#13;
rural," vols. 1 and II&#13;
(Manual for the Program of Socioeconomic Analysis of the Rural&#13;
Community) (1982).&#13;
The manual outlines a methodology and its theoretical&#13;
underpinnings for conducting a socioeconomic diagnosis of rural&#13;
communities for the purpose of designing development activities&#13;
which are based on a rational utilization of local resources.&#13;
The survey formas for community assessment are reproduced, as well&#13;
as instructions for their use. The diagnosis requires that data&#13;
be collected on such aspects as population, economic activities,&#13;
standard of living, available infrastructure and public services,&#13;
and previous community experiences with and attitudes towards&#13;
government development programs.  The resulto of the study are&#13;
used to reformulate state plans for rural development. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 115 -&#13;
addition, the manual discusses briefly the procedures for&#13;
training the researchers who will carry out the diagnostic&#13;
surveys.&#13;
3. "Manual del programa de apoyo a la formulacion de proyectos&#13;
productivos," vols. I and II&#13;
(Manual for the Support Program for Formulating Productive Projects)&#13;
(1982).&#13;
This manual identifies the steps to be followed and the&#13;
information required (such as socíoeconomic studies, resource&#13;
assessments, marketing surveys, as well as budgeting and&#13;
financing data) to design appropriate productive projects,&#13;
Included are sample survey forms (with instructions for&#13;
completion) for assessing potential investments in fruit growing,&#13;
livestock, agroindustry, small industry, wildlife, fish farming,&#13;
and tourism.&#13;
4. "Indicadores y criterios para la toma de decisiones en materia de&#13;
inversiones productivas -- PIDER"&#13;
(Indicators and Criteria for Decision Making in Regard to Productive&#13;
Investmento -- PIDER) (October 1982).&#13;
This manual contains additions and refinements to the format&#13;
described in document no. 3. It reproduces a survey form (with&#13;
instructions) for identifying community pilot projects. The form&#13;
covers all the important topics to be covered for community&#13;
diagnosis: attítudes of the community, population, local&#13;
organization existing infrastructure and support services, need&#13;
for trainíng an technícal assistance, employment, and probable&#13;
project benefits.&#13;
5. '"anual de procedimientos para la programacion de inversiones publicas&#13;
para desarrollo rural"&#13;
(Manual of Procedures for the Programming of Public Investments for&#13;
Rural Development) (January 1980).&#13;
luis is a general methodological manual written to assist&#13;
state government teams in developing microregional development&#13;
programo. It describes the purpose of community and&#13;
microregional data collection (locality studies) which are the&#13;
basis of diagnosing investment possibilities. Survey forms (with&#13;
instructions) are reproduced for the locality study, assessing&#13;
population, infrastructure, production activities, employment,&#13;
social services (health, water, education), and credit&#13;
availability.&#13;

            A social methodology for community
            participation in local investments : the experience of
            Mexico's PIDER program
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The PIDER rural development program in
            Mexico has carried out a large-scale effort for the social
            engineering of beneficiary participation. This paper
            outlines the history and experiences involved in building
            up, within the implementing agency, a coherent social
            methodology for eliciting farmers' participation in
            identifying priority local investments and implementing
            them. The methodology to promote peasant participation was
            articulated only gradually, with help from sociologists and
            other social scientists, through a long process of
            designing-testing-learning-revising; action research and
            social experiments at the community and microregional level
            were carried out to test and reformulate the participatory
            approach. The methodology refers to various stages of the
            project cycle: identification of local investments,
            planning, implementation, monitoring. Constraints on the
            application of the participatory program include the
            rigidity of the bureaucratic structure, cultural
            constraints, opposition to peasant participation for
            political reasons, interagency conflicts over policy and
            procedural issues, and the absence of weakness of
            village-based peasant organizations.
