&#13;
Introduction&#13;
&#13;
Over the past few years, the Water and Sanitation Program Africa has provided design and&#13;
implementation support to the Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) component of several social funds.&#13;
Based on this experience, two related issues have been identified as important: (i) the relationship of a&#13;
fund with the countryÃ¢&#128;&#153;s sector strategy Ã¢&#128;&#147; whether it operates without (or outside) a well defined national&#13;
WSS sector strategy, and (ii) the extent to which a social fund actually follows its own operational rules,&#13;
especially for WSS sub-projects which are likely to be complex in nature. Reasons for the first issue may&#13;
be: an updated or an effective strategy does not exist; it is formulated after the social fund has been&#13;
operational for a few years; or that the social fund is seen as a competitor by sector agencies. Reasons for&#13;
the second issue may be either that the social fund operational guidelines may not be adequate for the&#13;
WSS sub-projects or that time pressures may force decisions and procedures that do not support a true&#13;
demand responsive approach.&#13;
&#13;
This rapid assessment of the water supply and sanitation component of the Ethiopian Social&#13;
Rehabilitation and Development Fund is part of a wider study of water and sanitation in social funds in&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa, which is planned in three phases: (i) study of the WSS component of social funds in&#13;
selected countries, (ii) regional workshop to develop an action plan for effective WSS component, and (iii)&#13;
implementation of the action plan as appropriate. The main objectives of the first phase are to: (i) develop&#13;
a macro understanding of the role of WSS in social funds, (ii) draw on the ground experience of WSS&#13;
sub-projects in relation to design and sustainability issues, and (iii) develop lessons for WSS sub-projects&#13;
in future social fund operations and for decentralized delivery of WSS services. During the first phase,&#13;
rapid assessments were conducted of the water and sanitation components in the social funds of Ethiopia&#13;
(this report), Madagascar, Malawi and Mali.&#13;
&#13;
Field work comprised of two elements: (i) a series of interviews with key actors working on the ESRDF,&#13;
central and local government officials, staff of NGOs and other local development pr ograms; and (ii) site&#13;
visits to ESRDF sub-projects to meet with community members to discuss social fund operations. The&#13;
field work was supported by a detailed review of relevant information and secondary data, including the&#13;
ESRDF RWSS Handbook and Manuals, and Supervision Mission RWSS Reports (1997-2002).&#13;
&#13;
ESRDF -RWSS sub-projects promote the use of low -cost and simple to maintain technologies for direct&#13;
community participation, with a special emphasis on groundwater resources. In the selection of&#13;
technologies, careful attention is given to cost effectiveness related to the size of the community, the&#13;
expected lifetime of the facility and the capacity of the community to take responsibility for upkeep and&#13;
repairs. The ESRDF also takes care to integrate smaller community initiatives with larger mainstream&#13;
sector development programs, through close liaison with regional water bureaus. In terms of recurrent&#13;
costs related to the provision of water supply schemes, the goal is that they are self -sustaining, through&#13;
community user fees that are used to maintain the facilities. All Financing Agreements with communities&#13;
therefore specify the communityÃ¢&#128;&#153;s responsibility for maintenance and describe the community&#13;
management structures and procedures for collecting and applying user fees to cover facility maintenance.&#13;
Special encouragement is given to the representation of women on community water committees.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
While the actual number and distribution of schemes depends on community proposals, it was anticipated&#13;
that the ESRDF would finance 13,055 rural water supply schemes (8,913 hand dug wells, 1,492 spring&#13;
developments and 2,630 shallow wells) providing safe water for the first time to communities with a total&#13;
population of 3,381,500 people at an estimated cost of US$ 75 million. The period of duration of&#13;
ESRDF was scheduled between August 1996 and June 2001, and the program has been extended to&#13;
December 2002 to fully utilize the pledged amount, and a second phase is under preparation.&#13;
&#13;
ESRDF operates on a decentralized basis through Regional Offices. The ESRDF Board is the highest&#13;
policy level of the ESRDF structure, and the ESRDF Central Office plans and manages financial&#13;
transfers, and monitors and evaluates project implementation. Regional Steering Committees approve&#13;
sub-projects and ensure that the Regional Offices, which receive, process and recommend community&#13;
applications for ESRDF support, operate in accordance with the Operational Manual.&#13;

&#13;
                      Key Findings                                                     Recommendations&#13;
5.1.1. The planned use allocation for water and                      Base future preparation/planning on the&#13;
sanitation during ESRDF was US$ 75 million, of which                 implementation experience of ESRDF. [For the&#13;
only US$33 million had been budgeted for 2,322 sub-                  proposed ESRDF second phase, a total number of 3,037&#13;
projects as of October 2001, benefiting nearly 2 million             RWSS sub -projects is proposed over a five year period,&#13;
people.                                                              which is realistic].&#13;
5.1.2. The size of the RWSS component has proven too                 (i) spend greater effort on promotion activities,&#13;
optimistic because: (i) promotion took longer to                     especially in the remoter areas, (ii) prioritize early&#13;
introduce, (ii) time required to build organization under            recruitment of Promotion and Training Officers and&#13;
new decentralization system, (iii) introduction of more              Community Facilitators, (iii) emphasize low-cost, simple&#13;
complex schemes for which implementation capacity                    to maintain technologies for direct community&#13;
could not be rapidly developed, (iv) need to spread sub-             participation, (iv) batch sub-projects, concentrating in a&#13;
projects to all parts of the regions each year for Ã¢&#128;&#152;equityÃ¢&#128;&#153;          few zones at a time, to rationalize the implementation&#13;
reasons based on political considerations, which resulted            process Ã¢&#128;&#147; the desired equity will still be achieved by the&#13;
in reduced economies of scale, and (v) initial reluctance            end of the total project period, (v) spend greater effort&#13;
on the part of NGOs to work with ESRDF.                              on involving NGOs as Implementing Agents.&#13;
5.1.3. The RWSS component has seen a substantial                     Emphasize low-cost, simple to maintain technologies for&#13;
budget allocation increase over the last 2-3 years, which            direct community participation.&#13;
reflects a trend of approving larger and more expensive&#13;
schemes Ã¢&#128;&#147; a move from hand dug wells and spring&#13;
development to shallow drilled wells, motorized&#13;
boreholes and distribution systems.&#13;
5.1.4. Based on preliminary and indicative estimates of              Na&#13;
allocations, ESRDF accounted for approximately 35&#13;
percent of all allocations to the WSS Sector for the&#13;
financial year 2001-02.&#13;
5.1.5. Conventional (supply) driven approaches are still             Prepare promotional material on DRA and collaborate&#13;
common among many of the partners who are available                  with water sector institutions to disseminate knowledge,&#13;
to assist the ESRDF -RWSS component.                                 especially among middle and lower level staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.1.6. Many of the WMERD technical studies                           Project preparation/detailed design must address: (i)&#13;
undertaken have concentrated only on design of civil                 water management organizational structure, (ii)&#13;
works and have not addressed O&amp;M requirements.                       tariff/user fee appropriate to the technology proposed&#13;
                                                                     and the estimated water demand, (iii) access to spare&#13;
                                                                     parts and technical support.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      Key Findings                                                 Recommendations&#13;
5.1.7. As a starting point for all ESRDF sub-project             Reinforce informed investment choice and better&#13;
support, an expression of demand for improved services           understanding of operation and maintenance&#13;
and/or facilities should be received from a community,           requirements through closer dialogue between facilitator&#13;
which is encouraged to make informed choices about               (Implementing Agent) and communities.&#13;
service options and how those services are delivered.&#13;
Communities are then expected to contribute a&#13;
minimum of 10 percent toward the overall capital cost&#13;
of schemes and ultimately own and bear responsibility&#13;
for O&amp;M.&#13;
5.1.8. The introduction of DRA was probably easier in            Continue promoting DRA to ensure the relevant&#13;
Ethiopia through the ESRDF than it may have been                 sections of the WRM Policy are adhered to, and that&#13;
through the regular sector institutions. This is                 ESRDF continues to lead the way in DRA, especially for&#13;
particularly true as the latter were undergoing                  poor and remote communities.&#13;
restructuring within the decentralization framework. It&#13;
became easier to have the DRA more accepted and later&#13;
incorporated into the new WRM Policy. Thus, possibly,&#13;
the ESRDF approach suggests a way of introducing&#13;
DRA when no prior experience exists for RWSS.&#13;
5.1.9. Areas in which ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s experience have                    Continue the constructive dialogue which has been&#13;
contributed to the development of the WSS sector                 established between ESRDF and the MOWR, and the&#13;
strategy include: promotion of community management;             WMERD at regional and zonal levels, and particularly at&#13;
establishment of project initiation rules; involvement of        the new woreda water desk level.&#13;
women; communities making an informed choice;&#13;
demand responsive approach; cost sharing (10 percent&#13;
community contribution); establishment of community&#13;
water committees; development of procedures for O&amp;M&#13;
activities; capacity building of water committees;&#13;
planning process including promotion and dissemination&#13;
steps.&#13;

                     Key Findings                                                Recommendations&#13;
5.2.1. Steps in the program cycle include: plan/data        Review steps and prepare detailed yet Ã¢&#128;&#152;user friendlyÃ¢&#128;&#153;&#13;
reviews; surveys and analyses; consultations with WSS       guidelines as part of revision of RW SS Handbook.&#13;
sector agencies/local authorities; eligibility and access&#13;
rules; financial policies; priority settings and strategy&#13;
for targeting.&#13;
5.2.2. Steps in project cycle include: targeted             Review steps and prepare detailed yet Ã¢&#128;&#152;user friendlyÃ¢&#128;&#153;&#13;
promotion; formation of Community Project                   guidelines as part of revision of RWSS Handbook.&#13;
Committee; sub-project proposal; sub-project&#13;
appraisal; sub-project approval; preparation for&#13;
construction; sub -project construction; and&#13;
preparation for O&amp;M management.&#13;
5.2.3. Information on the possibility and conditions        Place greater emphasis on, and mobilize more resources&#13;
for ESRDF support to RWSS schemes is the first              for, promotion activities.&#13;
opportunity for ESRDF to make its message on&#13;
demand driven and community based development&#13;
known and understood. Unfortunately, it took quite&#13;
some time for the promotion messages to be&#13;
disseminated, particularly to remoter areas.&#13;
5.2.4. During the first couple of years, many projects      Encourage the assistance of NGOs, Regional/Zonal water&#13;
were formulated at regional/zonal level by NGOs             bureaus, and particularly the new Woreda Water Desks and&#13;

                     Key Findings                                                Recommendations&#13;
and government line bureaus; reflecting a more              Woreda Water Committees (where established) to assist&#13;
Ã¢&#128;&#152;supply drivenÃ¢&#128;&#153; than truly Ã¢&#128;&#152;demand drivenÃ¢&#128;&#153; approach.        communities in the identification and preparation of&#13;
Proposals were simply drawn from the regular                project proposals.&#13;
Ã¢&#128;&#152;project listsÃ¢&#128;&#153; in an attempt to jump-start the RWSS&#13;
component. Increasingly, the approach applied is&#13;
characterized by NGOs and Regional/Zonal Water&#13;
Bureaus assisting communities in the identification&#13;
and preparation of project proposals.&#13;
5.2.5. The community role in sub -project initiation        Liaise with the Consultant implementing the ESRDF&#13;
has improved, yet there are problems with clarity on        Impact Assessment Study (2002) and develop simple, field-&#13;
the exact numbers of people to be served by each            tested methods based on participation of communities for&#13;
sub-project.                                                obtaining reliable numbers of actual scheme users and&#13;
                                                            return journey water collection time (including queuing).&#13;
5.2.6. Field appraisals have confirmed that                 Spend more effort on complete sub-project preparation,&#13;
communities are neither fully aware nor adequately          including aspects of O&amp;M, as inadequate preparation is&#13;
informed of their financial liabilities and                 difficult to resolve through more rigorous appraisal.&#13;
responsibilities with regard to the future operation&#13;
and maintenance of facilities.&#13;
5.2.7. A variety of Implementing Agents are being           Encourage greater involvement of NGOs as Implementing&#13;
used, from medium sized contractors via NGOs to             Agents.&#13;
associations of artisans. The amount of departmental&#13;
implementation by Water Bureaus (force account or           Ensure level playing field for large-scale tenders (drilling&#13;
similar) was common during the early stages but has         and distribution schemes) to encourage greater&#13;
been drastically reduced. Regional state owned              involvement of private sector companies.&#13;
construction enterprises are now used to a varying&#13;
degree in the respective regions, ostensibly operating&#13;
independently and without subsidies, but there may&#13;
be an element of preferential treatment and this will&#13;
inevitably discourage private contractors from&#13;
investing in capacity for WSS work.&#13;
5.2.8. The ESRDF monitoring and evaluation system           Ensure greater data management discipline. Update the&#13;
is closely linked to and ultimately dependent on a          MIS and RWSS database especially with respect to number&#13;
dedicated, computerized Management Information              of users and actual costs for completed schemes.&#13;
System (MIS), which utilizes a Ã¢&#128;&#152;tailor-madeÃ¢&#128;&#153; package&#13;
and cannot easily accommodate the level of detail&#13;
required for effective RWSS monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, so the RWSS CO has developed a parallel&#13;
database in Microsoft Access. There are differences&#13;
between the numbers presented in the MIS and the&#13;
RWSS database.&#13;
5.2.9. Sub-projects are expected to be (i) demand           Compile comments of stakeholders and lessons learned on&#13;
driven, (ii) cost effective, and (iii) sustainable. These   methodology of implementation of Ã¢&#128;&#152;modelÃ¢&#128;&#153; projects with&#13;

There has been poor adherence to the Handbook and           attachment to current document, later by revision of core&#13;
Manuals, which have been under -utilized, and               text, once outcome of decentralization of water sector to&#13;
experience has shown that they are too complex.             woreda level is known.&#13;

&#13;
Policy Debates&#13;
5.3.1. In reconciling the short-term pressure to finish       Address the identified short-comings in the areas of&#13;
projects quickly and the long-term period needed to           project preparation/appraisal, and management&#13;
ensure ownership and sustainability, successive RWSS          development for operation and maintenance.&#13;
supervision missions have found that functionality and&#13;
utilization is adequate compar ed with the water sector&#13;
as a whole, though there is room for improvement, but&#13;
the safeguarding of long-term sustainability is not yet&#13;
satisfactory.&#13;
5.3.2. ESRDF has made a conscious effort to extend            Continue to actively engage in policy debates through&#13;
lessons learned to wider government operations for            sharing of lessons learned, performance reviews and&#13;
strategies to integrate DRA in sector institutions,           national level thematic workshops.&#13;
decentralization, private sector participation and&#13;
transparent procurement and disbursement procedures.&#13;
5.3.3. ESRDF is aligning itself with key decentralization     Continue to align ESRDF with decentralization policy&#13;
policy reforms through the pilot Woreda Development           reforms in order to maximize its impact on local&#13;
Fund, and a proposed continuation of the pilot during a       governance.&#13;
planned second phase in which ESRDF will finance&#13;
kebele requested sub-projects through block grants to&#13;
woredas, which are expected to follow bottom -up&#13;
mechanisms for identification, implementation and&#13;
monitoring, based on ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s experience.&#13;
5.3.4. The WRM Policy provides for grant support to           Consider an option that ESRDF could become the grant&#13;
RWSS, although with a part of the investment cost to          Ã¢&#128;&#152;windowÃ¢&#128;&#153; of the overall financing mechanism for RWSS&#13;
be met by the user communities.                               in Ethiopia.&#13;
Institutional Issues&#13;
5.3.5. RWS is currently dependent on mainly the zonal         Develop more consistently institutionalized ways of&#13;
WMERD departments for new development,                        working with the water and health bureaus, particularly&#13;
rehabilitation and O&amp;M support. Other important               the new Woreda Water Desk Officers and Sanitarians at&#13;
actors include parastatal construction companies,             woreda level, which will provide additional opportunities&#13;
NGOs linked to the State, private contractors and other       to strengthen dialogue with communities and secure&#13;
independent NGOs. For sanitation and health/hygiene           enhanced quality.&#13;
related issues the Health Bureau / Department are the&#13;
important actor and coordinator. Within the water&#13;
sector it is recognized that the absence of a water&#13;
structure at the woreda level is a bottleneck to the&#13;
planning, implementation, operation and maintenance&#13;
of RWS sub-projects.&#13;
5.3.6. Civil society and NGOs are not represented on          Review the issue of civil society and NGO representation&#13;

5.3.7. In the rush to complete physical implementation        Pay greater attention to : principles of DRA, community&#13;
of RWSS services many of the Ã¢&#128;&#152;softwareÃ¢&#128;&#153; components            contributions, gender aspects, cost effectiveness, VLOM&#13;
have been overlooked or underestimated, resulting in          principle, standardization of equipment and access to&#13;

1.      INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1.    Assessment Background&#13;
Social Funds (SFs) are quasi-financial intermediaries that channel resources, according to pre-determined&#13;
eligibility criteria, to small scale projects for poor and vulnerable groups, proposed, designed and&#13;
implemented by public and private agencies, such as local governments or NGOs, or by community&#13;
groups themselves. There is considerable variation across countries in terms of the objectives of social&#13;
funds and mechanisms used by them. Over the years these funds have evolved to respond to sector&#13;
reforms and stakeholder feedback. Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) has been one of the main&#13;
components in many of the social funds, and over the past few years, the Water and Sanitation Program&#13;
(WSP) has provided design and implementation support to the WSS component of several social funds.&#13;
&#13;
 Based on this experience, two related issues have been identified as important: (i) relationship of a fund&#13;
with the countryÃ¢&#128;&#153;s sector strategy Ã¢&#128;&#147; whether it operates without (or outside) a well defined national WSS&#13;
sector strategy, and(ii) extent to which a SF actually follows its own operational rules, especially for WSS&#13;
sub-projects which are likely to be complex in nature. Reasons for the first issue may be: an updated or an&#13;
effective strategy does not exist; it is formulated after the SF has been operational for a few years; or that&#13;
the SF is seen as a competitor by sector agencies. Reasons for the second issue may be either that the SF&#13;
operational guidelines may not be adequate for the WSS sub-projects or that time pressures may force&#13;
decisions and procedures that do not support a true demand responsive approach.&#13;
&#13;
This rapid assessment of the WSS component of the Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation and Development&#13;
Fund (ESRDF) is part of a wider study of Water and Sanitation in Social Funds in Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
(SSA), which is planned in three phases: (i) study of the WSS component of social funds in selected&#13;
countries in SAA, (ii) regional workshop to develop an action plan for effective WSS compone nt, and (iii)&#13;
implementation of the action plan as appropriate. The main objectives of the first phase are to: (i) develop&#13;
a macro understanding of the role of WSS in social funds, (ii) draw on the ground experience of WSS&#13;
sub-projects in relation to design and sustainability issues, and (iii) develop lessons for WSS sub-projects&#13;
in future SF operations and for decentralized delivery of WSS services. During this first phase, rapid&#13;
assessments were conducted of the water and sanitation components in the social funds of Ethiopia (this&#13;
report), Madagascar, Malawi and Mali.&#13;
&#13;
1.2.    Assessment Approach&#13;
&#13;
Field work comprised of two elements: (i) a series of interviews with key actors working on the ESRDF,&#13;
central and local government officials, staff of NGOs and other local development programs; and (ii) site&#13;
visits to ESRDF sub-projects to meet with community members to discuss social fund operations. The&#13;
field work was supported by a detailed review of relevant information and secondary data, including the&#13;
ESRDF RWSS Handbook and associated Manuals, and Supervision Mission RWSS Reports (1997-2002).&#13;
&#13;
1.3.    History and Background of the Social Fund in Ethiopia&#13;
&#13;
The Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation and Development Fund (ESRDF) is a Fund established by the&#13;
Federal Government of Ethiopia for implementation of demand driven projects. The fund is supported&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      1&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
by IDA, UNDP and several other bilateral donors with a view to accomplish sustainable, cost effective&#13;
community based development initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
1.3.1.    Pilot Phase - Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation Fund (ESRF): 1992-96&#13;
&#13;
The pilot ESRF began in December 1992 as a component of the Ethiopian Recovery and Rehabilitation&#13;
Program (ERRP). The aim was to test whether a social fund approach could be an effective way of giving&#13;
millions of poor households and communities in one of the worldÃ¢&#128;&#153;s poorest communities, greater control&#13;
over their economic and social advancement, a goal that could not be achieved by central public agencies&#13;
alone. The US$ 13 million ESRF pilot operated in three out of 11 region s, with 10 percent of its financing&#13;
available for other regions. Within a general sub-project limit of US$ 250,000, the Fund was open to any&#13;
initiatives with a positive developmental benefit for the community. In practice, the pilot focused on&#13;
support for: (i) rehabilitation of basic health facilities, primary schools, micro-dams, feeder roads, water&#13;
supply and sanitation facilities; (ii) programs in adult skills development and literacy training; and (iii)&#13;
support for income-generating ventures carried out by small groups, often consisting of women.&#13;
&#13;
The ESRF was piloted to determine whether a specialized financing agency could jump-start the process&#13;
of participative community-based development to empower local communities from the outset, and to&#13;
compensate for the inevitable length of time that it would take to strengthen weak regional institutions. In&#13;
addition to testing whether the mechanism would work (respond to beneficiary initiated proposals and&#13;
deliver the priority infrastructure and services required), it was also important to ensure that the Fund&#13;
could do so at acceptable costs and levels of effectiveness and efficiency. Through the pilot, the ESRF&#13;
demonstrated its capacity to foster and respond to community led efforts, and to deliver good quality&#13;
infrastructure and services with significant community investment, at lower costs and more efficiently&#13;
than could be done by public agencies.&#13;

&#13;
To some extent, this was a reflection of the careful limits placed on the ESRFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s activities, which operated&#13;
with small projects that were suited to community participation, using simple technologies. Community&#13;
Project Committees were established to manage implementation, and Water Committees to manage&#13;
operation including the setting of water charges/tariffs and collecting of user fees. The money collected&#13;
and used for maintenance and repairs was reported as being sufficient. The provision of community water&#13;
supply infrastructure during ESRF provided 67,000 inhabitants of poor households with safe alternatives&#13;
to untreated water sources at an affordable cost.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.3.2.   Ethiopian Social Rehabilitation and Development Fund (ESRDF): 1996-2002&#13;
&#13;
Based on the evaluation of the pilot, the Government decided to continue and expand the ESRF as part&#13;
of its poverty reduction program to all re gions of the country, with a shift from emergency to&#13;
development work, and a focus on poor and remote communities. The Proclamation to provide for the&#13;
establishment of the ESRDF was published on 13th February 1996, with the following stated objectives:&#13;
(i) to improve the living standards of rural communities through the provision and strengthening of basic&#13;
social services; (ii) to enhance the income generating capacity of poor communities by laying down&#13;
economic infrastructure and providing services; (iii) to promote a community-based approach in project&#13;
identification, preparation, implementation, administration and maintenance; (iv) to assist in the&#13;
formation and development of self sustaining micro finance institutions to provide credit services to the&#13;
poor; and (v) to assist grassroots organizations and communities develop their technical and managerial&#13;
capabilities in all aspects of project activities.&#13;
&#13;
With respect to the RWSS component, the ESRDF finances rural water supply sub-projects to raise the&#13;
health standards of rural communities and assist in reducing womenÃ¢&#128;&#153;s burden of fetching water. The sub-&#13;
projects promote the use of low -cost and simple to maintain technologies for direct community&#13;
participation, with a special emphasis on groundwater resources. In the selection of technologies, careful&#13;
attention is given to cost effectiveness related to the size of the community, the expected lifetime of the&#13;
facility and the capacity of the community to take responsibility for upkeep and repairs. The ESRDF also&#13;
take care to integrate smaller community initiatives with larger mainstream sector development programs,&#13;
through close liaison with regional water bureaus. In terms of recurrent costs related to the provision of&#13;
water supply schemes, the goal is that they are self-sustaining, through community user fees that are used&#13;
to maintain the facilities.&#13;
&#13;
All Financing Agreements with communities therefore specify the communityÃ¢&#128;&#153;s responsibility for&#13;
maintenance and describe the community management structures and procedures for collecting and&#13;
applying user fees to cover facility maintenance. Special encouragement is given to the representation of&#13;
women on community water committees. While the actual number and distribution of schemes depends&#13;
on community proposals, based on the ESRF assessments of community needs it was anticipated that the&#13;
ESRDF would finance 13,055 rural water supply schemes (8,913 hand dug wells, 1,492 spring&#13;
developments and 2,630 shallow wells) providing safe water for the first time to communities with a total&#13;
population of 3,381,500 people at an estimated cost of US$ 75 million. The period of duration of ESRDF&#13;
was scheduled between August 1996 and June 2001, though the program has been extended up to&#13;
December 2002 to fully utilize the pledged amount, and a second phase is under preparation.&#13;
&#13;
1.4      Organizational Structure of ESRDF&#13;
&#13;
ESRDF operates on a decentralized basis through Regional Offices. The ESRDF Board is the highest&#13;
policy level of the ESRDF structure. The ESRDF Central Office plans and manages financial transfers,&#13;
and monitors and evaluates project implementation. Regional Steering Committees approve sub-projects&#13;
and ensure that the Regional Offices, which receive, process and recommend community applications for&#13;
ESRDF support, operate in accordance with the Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.4.1.   Central Level&#13;
&#13;
The Board, chaired by the Prime Minister or representative, consists of the Head of the Regional Affairs&#13;
Bureau, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Economic Development and Cooperation, the Minister&#13;
of Water Resources, and the Minister of Agriculture. The ESRDF General Manager is a member and acts&#13;
as its secretary. The Board is responsible for ensuring consistency with ESRDF policies and the&#13;
procedures of the Operational Manual, for approving the annual budget and work program, for&#13;
approving progress reports, and for approving the external auditor of the ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s operations.&#13;
&#13;
The Central Office (CO) is headed by a General Manager who keeps the Board informed on key issues&#13;
relating to ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s operations. The CO is responsible for (i) ensuring that ESRDF operates according to&#13;
the Operational Manual; (ii) preparing annually for the Board and IDA a review of ESRDF performance&#13;
(including a financial report), and a consolidated work program and budget based on the pipeline of&#13;
proposals received by Regional Offices (ROs); (iv) replenishing regional accounts on receipt of specified&#13;
financial records and supporting documentation; (v) managing all international procurement for ESRDF;&#13;
(vi) managing the p roject performance monitoring and information system; (vii) managing the capacity&#13;
building, training and research program and providing technical support to regional offices; (viii)&#13;
proposing policy changes to the Board; and (ix) representing ESRDF in all legal matters. The General&#13;
Manager is assisted by two deputy General Managers, one for technical issues and the other for finance&#13;
and administration.&#13;
&#13;
1.4.2.   Regional Level&#13;
&#13;
Each Regional Steering Committee (RSC) is responsible for approving sub-projects proposed by its RO,&#13;
once satisfied that they are in line with regional development goals. The RSC is also responsible for&#13;
ensuring that the RO follows the requirements of the Operational Manual; and for approving the annual&#13;
financial report, and annual program and budget of the RO for submission to the Board and IDA. The&#13;
Chairperson of the National Regional Council, or representative, chairs the RSC consisting of the Heads&#13;
of the Social Development Sector, the Economic Development Sector, the Planning and Economic&#13;
Development Bureau, and the Finance Bureau; representatives of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia or&#13;
the Development Bank of Ethiopia, and representatives of civic organizations. The Manager of the&#13;
ESRDF RO, appointed by the Chairperson of the National Regional Council, is a member of the RSC&#13;
and acts as its secretary. Eleven ROs, (and three Regional Sub-Offices in larger regions), are responsible&#13;
for the day-to-day ESRDF operations, promoting the activities of the Fund, processing sub-project&#13;
proposals, proposing appraised sub -projects for financing to the RSC, supervising implementation and&#13;
post-project maintenance, disbursing sub-project funds, preparing work programs based on the pipeline&#13;
of received proposals, maintaining the accounts and project monitoring information, and submitting&#13;
reports and documentation to the CO.&#13;
&#13;
2.       MACRO OVERVIEW&#13;
2.1.     Extent and Nature of WSS Portfolio in ESRDF&#13;
At the time of designing the ESRDF program the RWSS sub -project component was estimated at US$75&#13;
million, later reduced to about USD 66 million after canceling planned equipment purchases, e.g. for&#13;
drilling rigs which were originally going to be leased out to private sector companies which did not have&#13;

their own equipment. The component was designed to serve about 3.4 million people over a period of&#13;
five years (1996 - 2001) by constructing 13,035 small scale water schemes for poor rural communities.&#13;
These figures were not as such targets but estimates of what community priorities throughout Ethiopia&#13;
would call for, and assuming all possible means of implementation capacity would be deployed. As of&#13;
October 2001, about USD 33 million has been budgeted for 2,322 schemes, serving an estimated 2&#13;
million people.&#13;

This size of the RWSS component has proven far too optimistic.&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢    It took longer to promote among communities what opportunities for support the RWSS component&#13;
     constituted.&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢    It took time to build and stabilize an organization with sufficient capacity under the new regional&#13;
     decentralization system.&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢    The preference, not necessarily the communityÃ¢&#128;&#153;s, was turned towards more complex and costly&#13;
     schemes for which implementation capacity could not be rapidly developed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                     5&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                  Rapid Assessment Of ESRDF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢   For political reasons most regional ESRDF offices have been obliged to spread their sub-projects to&#13;
    all parts of the regions each year on Ã¢&#128;&#152;equityÃ¢&#128;&#153; grounds.&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢   The dispersed activities have no doubt resulted in reduced economies of scale, cost efficiency and&#13;
    total implementation volume (as well as quality).&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢   An annual Ã¢&#128;&#152;batchingÃ¢&#128;&#153; of sub -projects, concentrating in a few zones at a time, would have served to&#13;
    rationalize the entire implementation process, and the desired equity would still be achieved by the&#13;
    end of the total project period.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank had initially envisaged a much smaller fund, but the Government of Ethiopia estimated&#13;
that sufficient capacity existed in order to implement such a large budget. Also, there was an initial&#13;
reluctance on the part of NGOs to work with ESRDF, though the relationship has gradually improved&#13;
over time, as ESRDF was perceived by the NGOs as having a Ã¢&#128;&#152;top -downÃ¢&#128;&#153; approach to planning.&#13;
&#13;
The RWSS component has seen a substantial budget allocation increase over the last 2    -3 years, which&#13;
reflects a trend of approving larger and more expensive schemes. Hand dug well and spring protection&#13;
schemes account for only 14 percent of the RWSS budget compared to an estimated 46 percent in the&#13;
SAR. The balance is taken up by the more complex and expensive shallow drilled wells, motorized&#13;
boreholes and distribution systems etc. The SAR estimates were only intended for general planning&#13;
purposes and the actual choice of scheme technology is in principle demand driven, so the issue is one of&#13;
the level of informed community investment choice and awareness of consequent future water charges&#13;
and O&amp;M requirements.&#13;
&#13;
There is a similar comparison with respect to the number of schemes planned and realized. Though the&#13;
development of low cost point sources still accounts for more than 50 percent of the total number of&#13;
RWSS sub-projects, this is heavily influenced by the chosen strategy in one particular region. There is&#13;
disparity across the regions in terms of technology choice with the average cost of schemes in some&#13;
regions being less than one third that of those in other regions. Such disparities in technology selection&#13;
are unlikely to be a result of communitiesÃ¢&#128;&#153; own choices.&#13;
&#13;
Nevertheless, an estimated 2 million will be provided access to potable water Ã¢&#128;&#147; mostly for the first time as&#13;
rehabilitation is a modest part of the program, and this is a commendable result given the capacity&#13;
constraints and complications of targeting remote parts of Ethiopia. It should be noted, however, that the&#13;
number of beneficiaries has often been disputed as the methodologies for establishing their prospective&#13;
and actual numbers have not been well developed.&#13;
&#13;
The design for the ESRDF incorporated a comprehensive capacity building program to: (i) prepare the&#13;
Fund for its expanded role; (ii) respond to the weaknesses among bureau staff, NGOs, local contractors;&#13;
and (iii) provide communities with skills to manage their own initiatives by training community project&#13;
committees, and strengthening links between communities and local facilitating groups. Unfortunately,&#13;
the process to access the capacity building fund, which is managed from the CO, was somewhat lengthy.&#13;
Draft revised cost guidelines (May 2000) now include community level training and capacity building&#13;
aspects as part of the sub -project budget, so funds should be easier to access.&#13;

&#13;
Conventional (supply) driven approaches are still common among many of the partners who are available&#13;
to assist the ESRDF-RWSS component.&#13;
   Box 2.1: Changing Approach&#13;
&#13;
   During discussions with the South Wollo Zonal Department of WMERD in Amhara Region, the staff&#13;
   expressed the view that they didnÃ¢&#128;&#153;t see the ESRDF sub-project approach as any different to their own or&#13;
   those that they had implemented on behalf of other agencies. There is an understandable tendency to fall&#13;
   back on old and familiar approaches, but this does clearly point towards a need for greater adherence to&#13;
   ESRDF approaches during implementation.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Many of the WMERD technical studies undertaken have concentrated only on the design of the civil&#13;
works, and have not addressed O&amp;M requirements. Conventional approaches tend to prevail as some&#13;
WMERD departments are more comfortable with Ã¢&#128;&#152;business as usualÃ¢&#128;&#153; and communities tend to request for&#13;
conventional solutions that are better known to them. Economic evaluation of technical options for a&#13;
basic service level is rarely discussed with communities, notably the O&amp;M costs are often left out. With&#13;
the implementation of the proposed new MOWR strategy, however, it is expected that there will be a&#13;
change in Ã¢&#128;&#152;mind -setÃ¢&#128;&#153; of staff within the regional water bureaus and lower levels, away from a Ã¢&#128;&#152;supply&#13;
drivenÃ¢&#128;&#153; towards a more Ã¢&#128;&#156;Demand Responsive ApproachÃ¢&#128;&#157;. The current IDA supported MOWR Rural&#13;
Water Supply Demonstration Project, launched during 1999 in 3-4 woredas of the four larger regions, has&#13;
raised awareness of DRA through stakeholder consultation.&#13;
&#13;
As a starting point for all ESRDF sub-project support, an expression of demand for improved services&#13;
and/or facilities should be received from a community. In addition, communities are encouraged to make&#13;
informed choices about services options and how those services are to be delivered. Communities are&#13;
then expected to contribute toward the overall capital cost of each schem e; a Ã¢&#128;&#152;minimum of 10 percentÃ¢&#128;&#153;&#13;
according to ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s rules. The size of the scheme specific contribution (total and per household) will&#13;
vary with the technology selected and to some extent be relative to the level of service provided.&#13;
Furthermore, such contributions help to confirm actual demand and help secure the commitment of&#13;
individual community members.&#13;
&#13;
Communities represented by 'Community Project Committees' (CPCs) will ultimately own and bear&#13;
responsibility for the operation and maintenance of all facilities. In regions were they have introduced&#13;
specific (and different) management strategies (e.g. Water Boards for small towns) the CPC will be&#13;
replaced through elections at the time of sub-project commissioning. In general, ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s approach&#13;
towards ensuring a strong community role in RWSS has been explicitly confirmed by the WRM Policy.&#13;
&#13;
Once compliance with ESRDF aims and objectives has been verified, project interventions can be&#13;
endorsed at local level (kebele and woreda). At a higher level, the Regional Steering Committee (RSC) is&#13;
mandated to approve sub-projects on the recommendation of ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s Regional Manager. Being a&#13;
technical adviser to the RSC, the regional water bureaus are informed of the detailed requirement of each&#13;
sub-project and then expected to assist implementation, as well as create local capacity for O&amp;M support.&#13;
It is only recently that systematic efforts have been made to ensure clear national policies and strategies to&#13;
facilitate effective RWSS development activities across the country Ã¢&#128;&#147; again with ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s experiences as&#13;
an important part of the guidance.&#13;
&#13;
For the demand responsive approach to be effective in rural areas, it is essential that the technical and&#13;
financial capacity of each community be strengthened. Considering the diverse situations across Ethiopia&#13;
it is difficult to adhere to one rigid set of rules; some degree of flexibility and innovation is inevitably&#13;
required. Departures from ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s mainstream rules should however be specific and justified on&#13;
objective socio-economic grounds for the actual sub -project.&#13;
&#13;
The introduction of DRA was probably easier in Ethiopia through the ESRDF than it may have been&#13;
through the regular sector institutions. This is particularly true as the latter were undergoing restructuring&#13;
within the decentralization framework. With the active participation of the zonal water departments in the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
selection and appraisal process, to some extent the DRA has become more acceptable and was later&#13;
incorporated into the Water Resources Management Policy, thu s, possibly the ESRDF approach suggests&#13;
a way of introducing DRA when no prior experience exists for RWSS.&#13;
&#13;
2.3.2.    Sector Policy&#13;
&#13;
The Water Resources Management (WRM) Policy came into effect only in 1999, so it is important to note&#13;
that the ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s RWSS component was designed without such a policy in existence. It is fair to say that&#13;
ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s approach and project design for RWSS influenced the WRM Policy, as the principles adopted&#13;
for the RWSS component of ESRDF are very much in line with the new policy.&#13;
&#13;
The overall goal of the WRM Policy is: to enhance and promote all national efforts towards the efficient, equitable and&#13;
optimum utilization of the available water resources of Ethiopia for significant socio-economic development on sustainable&#13;
basis .&#13;
&#13;
The WRM policy has addressed most of the RWS issues in an open-ended manner at the Federal level.&#13;
Regional governments have set out general guidelines for long term planning, as presented in their&#13;
respective 5 -year plans, but there are no endorsed, coherent regional strategies in line with the WRM&#13;
Policy. Some regional governments like those of Amhara, Oromiya, SNNPRS and Tigray have taken&#13;
recent measures to separate the regulatory duties (Regional Water Bureaus) from the implementation&#13;
activities (Regional Water Works Enterprises), though there will inevitably be a considerable transition&#13;
period from implementation to regulation, with some regions ahead of others in the process.&#13;
&#13;
2.3.3.    Sector Strategy&#13;
&#13;
The Ministry of Water Resources has prepared a draft Water Supply and Sanitation Development Strategy&#13;
(April, 2001) and a subsequent draft National Water Strategy (September, 2001).&#13;
&#13;
The general objective of the development strategy for water supply and sanitation is: to develop viable and&#13;
implementable guidelines that promote the sustainable, efficient, effective, reliable, affordable and user-acceptable development&#13;
of water supply and sanitation services, including livestock watering, in Ethiopia in line with the Ethiopian Water Resources&#13;
Management Policy and other relevant policies endorsed at the Federal and Regional levels.&#13;
&#13;
The key principles in the WSS context are:&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Water as an economic and social good&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Decentralization/localization&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Community management/empowerment&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Private/informal sector participation&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Demand responsive approach&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Sustainable development and management of WSS systems&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Integration of water supply and sanitation&#13;
&#13;
                                                               9&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                  Rapid Assessment Of ESRDF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The draft Strategy proposes the establishment of a Water Supply and Sanitation Council (WSSC) at&#13;
regional level for the coordination of activities by all stakeholders and a Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
Fund (WSSF) to coordinate and stream line funding.&#13;
&#13;
2.3.4.   ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s Contribution to Development of WSS Sector Strategy&#13;
&#13;
Areas in which ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s experiences have contributed to the development of the WSS sector strategy&#13;
include:Enabling Environment: The draft WSS sector strategy recognizes and promotes community&#13;
management as an efficient and sustainable system for RWSS development, and the development of&#13;
project initiation rules that establish the responsibilities of communities, government, donors and service&#13;
providers, i.e. rules of engagement. Principles for development of water committee formulation and&#13;
administration will be developed and steps taken to legalize water committees.&#13;
&#13;
Stakeholders : The involvement of women in all stages of the project cycle and all activities is now&#13;
recognized as is the need for communities/users to make informed choices on their own. The role of&#13;
Government will become increasingly regulatory, supervisory, supportive and facilitative.&#13;
&#13;
Finance and Economy: Criteria for resource allocation shall be based on communitiesÃ¢&#128;&#153; willingness and&#13;
readiness to develop their own WSS services (Demand Responsive Approach). In terms of cost sharing&#13;
arrangements (cost recovery), Government will cover up to 90 percent of capital cost while communities&#13;
will pay for at least 10 percent through cash, labor and/or materials. O&amp;M costs will be covered 100&#13;
percent by communities while Government, ESAs and NGOs will cover all capacity building costs. A&#13;
Community Water Committee (CWC) must be established in order to access financial support, its legal&#13;
liability defined, and at least the minimum amount of community contribution be deposited in a local&#13;
bank or accredited institution. Contracting arrangements should also be made between communities and&#13;
contractors in a formal agreement with payment schedules tied to specific outputs. Prices to be paid for&#13;
WSS services in the form of charges shall be fixed with a view of providing sustainable services at&#13;
affordable prices with the O&amp;M cost setting process conducted in a consultative and participatory&#13;
manner with communities.&#13;
&#13;
Technical Issues: Development of procedures and processes for O&amp;M activities based on the different types&#13;
of WSS systems and preparation of manuals for the execution of O&amp;M activities. Short term training&#13;
programs to be developed specifically tailored to O&amp;M needs and dealing with, among others, technical,&#13;
financial, administrative and community participation aspects. Development of standards and&#13;
specifications for equipment, tools, materials, spare parts and consumables.&#13;
&#13;
Capacity Building: Promotion of training programs that will include financial management, schemes&#13;
administration, O&amp;M, participatory planning, monitoring &amp; evaluation, drilling and construction.&#13;
Provision of incentives, information, guidance, financial assistance and training to attract the&#13;
private/informal sector towards water and sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Project Formulation and Development Process: Recognition that the stages of project development include pre-&#13;
investment, appraisal, approval, implementation, operation, monitoring, evaluation and impact&#13;
assessment. The planning process will include promotion and dissemination, formation of water&#13;
committees, assessment of needs, preliminary discussions on cost sharing, agreement on community&#13;
&#13;
                                                      10&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     Rapid Assessment Of ESRDF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
contributions, official request to WSSC/water desk, appraisal of request at woreda level,&#13;
recommendations, approval, Project Agreement amongst stakeholders, user / committee / caretaker&#13;
training, detailed design including source selection with the involvement of communities,&#13;
tendering/contracting, execution, commissioning, O&amp;M, monitoring &amp; evaluation and impact&#13;
assessment.&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation: Design and construction of sanitation facilities will be undertaken by the private sector and/or&#13;
grass roots level government agencies based on national guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
Clearly ESRDF has had an influence on the evolution of a DRA strategy in Ethiopia, especially given the&#13;
scale of the WSS-ESRDF share allocation in the Total WSS sector. ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s impact has influenced the&#13;
introduction of DRA sooner rather than later, through demonstration of the feasibility and usefulness of&#13;
the approach, especially in poor and remote areas. ESRDF is not a replacement for larger-scale public&#13;
agency responsibility for delivering sector programs, but rather an essential complement, because&#13;
while the ESRDF ensures that sector standards are respected, it is can also respond rapidly and flexibly&#13;
to community initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
3.        PROGRAM &amp; PROJECT CYCLE - DESIGN &amp; SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
3.1.      Program and Project Cycle&#13;
The project cycle for (sub -project) implementation is an essential element of project design, defining&#13;
steps, roles of stakeholders and necessary procedures. In addition, the WSS component needs a&#13;
Ã¢&#128;&#152;programÃ¢&#128;&#153; part for planned activities, such as preparation of promotion and training material, general&#13;
capacity building, mobilization of implementation resources, establishment of project organization and&#13;
developing working relationships to key partners.&#13;

Within the ESRDF cycle, there is no operation and maintenance phase as such, as communities have&#13;
undertaken full responsible for this, with technical support from usually the zonal water department,&#13;
though ESRDF conducts post implementation monitoring of sub-projects.&#13;

monitoring as follows:&#13;

&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢   Prioritisation of community sub-projects within region&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢   Promotion of specific sub-projects and preparation of submissions for appraisal&#13;

&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢   Monitoring and evaluation and follow up backstopping&#13;
&#13;
These steps are generally indicative of a sequential procedure but certain steps are required to be&#13;
overlapped a nd the overall sequence was envisaged to be applied to sub areas within a region in order to&#13;
implement a workable phased program.&#13;
&#13;
In practice, the guidelines presented in the RWSS Handbook and the Technical and&#13;
Community/Institutional Manuals have not always been followed, particularly as regards aspects that&#13;
should have been addressed at project preparation/appraisal stage.&#13;
&#13;
3.1.1.   Promotion and Sub-Project Preparation&#13;
&#13;
Information on the possibility and conditions for ESRDF support for RWSS schemes is the f              irst&#13;
opportunity for ESRDF to make its message on demand driven and community based development&#13;
known and understood among eligible communities. Unfortunately, it took quite some time for the&#13;
promotion activities to be disseminated, particularly to remoter areas. It is somewhat puzzling, given the&#13;
rural water supply problems of the country, that ESRDF was not flooded by applications and requests.&#13;
The true demand was perhaps partly hidden as many requests amounted only to a brief letter (not a&#13;
proposal in the Operational Manual sense). During the first couple of years, therefore, many projects&#13;
were formulated at regional/zonal level, by NGOs and government line bureaus; reflecting a more 'supply&#13;
driven' than truly 'demand driven' approach. Proposals were simply drawn from the regular Ã¢&#128;&#152;project listsÃ¢&#128;&#153;&#13;
in an attempt to jump-start the RWSS component.&#13;
&#13;
Increasingly, the approach applied is characterized by NGOs and Regional Water Bureaus assisting&#13;
communities in the identification and preparation of project proposa ls. The availability of Promotion and&#13;
Training Officers (PTOs) and the recent addition of Community Facilitators (CFs) continue to have a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    13&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                  Rapid Assessment Of ESRDF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
positive impact on the origin and quality of project proposals, as well as on the way in which projects are&#13;
carried out.&#13;
&#13;
Despite difficulties verifying the situation, recent figures suggest that the community role in sub-project&#13;
initiation has improved drastically. For example, from Amhara it has been reported that the local&#13;
government administration has tabled one quarter of all project proposals, another 13 percent have been&#13;
forwarded by NGOs and 39 percent came directly from community groups. In Tigray and the Southern&#13;
Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Regional State all project proposals were reported as coming directly&#13;
from communities. In-depth investigations would probably show that there is a similar combination of&#13;
initiation initiatives also in these regions Ã¢&#128;&#147; which is quite acceptable as long as the community has been&#13;
allowed to play its full role in the dialo gue with the intermediary.&#13;
&#13;
3.1.2.    Appraisal&#13;
&#13;
The appraisal of project documentation is steadily improving, with all the complexities illustrated below.&#13;
Of particular importance to the Regional Offices of the ESRDF is detailed information relating to&#13;
meeting s held with communities and decisions made on the technical and financial options available to&#13;
the respective user groups. Field visits have however confirmed that communities are neither fully aware&#13;
nor adequately informed of their financial liabilities and responsibilities with regard to the future&#13;

Inadequate sub-project preparation, however, is difficult to resolve through more rigorous appraisal and&#13;
more effort needs to be spent on preparation.&#13;
&#13;
3.1.3.    Implementation&#13;
&#13;
The implementation of all ESRDF projects closely follows guidelines and regulations laid out in the&#13;
ESRDF Operational Manual. Further guidance exists on water supply and sanitation projects in the&#13;
RWSS Handbook with its Technical and Community/ Institutional volumes. To encourage greater&#13;
adherence to ESRDF guidelines and regulations the Handbook and other associated materials have been&#13;
translated into some of the regional languages to become more widely accessible to all users.&#13;
&#13;
A variety of Implementing Agents are being used Ã¢&#128;&#147; from medium sized contractors via NGOs to&#13;
associations of artisans. The amount of implementation by Water Bureaus/ Departments (force account&#13;
&#13;

or similar) was common during the early stages but has been drastically reduced. The new actors on the&#13;
scene are the regional state owned construction enterprises, used to a varying degree in the respective&#13;
regions. Whereas these enterprises are said to be operating independently and without subsidies, it is&#13;
obvious that they receive preferential treatment at least in some of the regions. This will inevitably&#13;
discourage private contractors from investing in capacity for WSS work.&#13;
&#13;
3.1.4.      Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
The ESRDF monitoring and evaluation process is closely linked to and ultimately dependent on a&#13;
dedicated, computerized Management Information System (MIS). Data, gathered by ESRDF Project&#13;
Officers (POs) are sent to and compiled by the ESRDF Central Office (CO). A wide range of&#13;
information is entered into the MIS and aggregated for onward transmission to donors and partner&#13;
agencies and for the internal use of administrative staff. The MIS, however, utilizes a Ã¢&#128;&#152;tailor-madeÃ¢&#128;&#153;&#13;
package and cannot easily accommodate the level of detail required for effective RWSS monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, so the RWSS CO has developed a parallel database in Microsoft Access. Unfortunately there&#13;
are differences between the numbers presented in the general MIS and the RWSS database, though it is&#13;
expected that these two databases will improve through better data management discipline.&#13;
&#13;
3.2.        RWSS Handbook and Manuals&#13;
&#13;
ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s RWSS component was designed with the emerging principles of a Demand Responsive&#13;
Approach in mind. At the time of formulating the component, three key principles were given&#13;
prominence. Sub-projects were expected to be (i) demand driven; (ii) cost effective; and (iii) sustainable.&#13;
The principles were elaborated within the first year of project effectiveness in the ESRDF Handbook for&#13;
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation which had two attendant volumes: Community and Institutional&#13;
Development Manual and Technical Design Manual. These documents set out fairly comprehensive and&#13;
ambitious implementation guidelines/procedures within the overall framework of the ESRDF&#13;
Operational Manual Ã¢&#128;&#147; deemed to be required in order to develop sustainable sub -projects.&#13;

An international consulting company, in association with a local company, was contracted to prepare the&#13;
Handbook/Manuals and active work took place in Ethiopia during August to November 1996. The Ã¢&#128;&#152;first&#13;
draftÃ¢&#128;&#153; dated September 1996 was reviewed/commented on in a workshop held in October 1996 with&#13;
participation from a wide range of RWS actors. Valuable and constructive comments were provided. The&#13;
second draft was submitted in December 1996, incorporating workshop comments and being&#13;
substantially improved in terms of content, editing and compliance with the ESRDF Operational Manual.&#13;
The final versions of the Handbook/Manuals were issued in April 1997.&#13;
&#13;
A summary of group discussions on the problems faced in utilization of the handbook/ manuals and&#13;
proposals for improvements were recorded in the proceedings of an ESRDF RWSS workshop on&#13;
Ã¢&#128;&#152;Implementation of Sustainable Rural Water SystemsÃ¢&#128;&#153; , held in Addis Ababa during January 2000.&#13;

For a US$ 75 million RWSS component, there would have been every reason to justify US$ 10,000 or&#13;
more on printing and disseminating copies of the Handbook and Manuals as they are vital tools for&#13;
implementation of RWSS sub-projects, which still appear underutilized. Subsequent experience has&#13;
shown that the Handbook and Manuals are too complex and should have a more Ã¢&#128;&#152;user friendlyÃ¢&#128;&#153; format.&#13;
&#13;
Several Ã¢&#128;&#152;Model ProjectsÃ¢&#128;&#153; have recently been introduced by ESRDF to be implemented in strict accordance&#13;
with the ESRDF Operational Manual and RWSS Handbook. Projects will then serve as foci and examples&#13;
of best practice for future schemes Ã¢&#128;&#147; during all steps of the project cycle. Reports are expected from the&#13;
respective regions undertaking model projects. The lessons learned from implementation of the Ã¢&#128;&#152;Model&#13;
ProjectsÃ¢&#128;&#153; will input to the revision of the RWSS Handbook and Manuals for use during the proposed&#13;
ERSDF second phase.&#13;

there are many examples whereby a community only hears of ESRDF through the Zonal WMERD&#13;
Department.&#13;

The community of Degan, Amhara Region, had requested the Zonal WMERD Department for an improved&#13;
water supply on many occasions but without success. Finally, the WMERD put the community in contact with&#13;
                                              ment of their request by the Woreda, a study was undertaken.&#13;

Box 3.2: Capacity of Communities&#13;
&#13;
In the small town of Gassaye, Amhara, a motorized pumping system was being installed (FY 97/8) on a borehole&#13;
(drilled FY 96/97, originally intended for a handpump); a distribution system to the town was part of the project.&#13;
There was little evidence that the community had been involved in the project identification and appraisal, or&#13;
indeed that they had made any collective decision about the source or service level. Labour contribution for&#13;
trenching was organized but no discussion of recurrent costs had as yet taken place; will the majority be able to&#13;
pay the cost of pumped/distributed water? Overall, the impression was that the WMERD Zonal officer was&#13;
managing the project.&#13;

Sub-project Proposal : Increasingly, the approach applied is characterized by the positive development that&#13;
NGOs and Regional Water Bureaus are assisting communities in the identification and preparation of&#13;
project proposals.&#13;

The community of Sega and Misa in Soro Zone, SNNP Region, approached a local NGO, Water Action, for&#13;
assistance in preparing a proposal. Water Action helped form a WatSan committee and the proposal was&#13;
developed in collaboration between Water Action and the committee. Agreed components included water supply,&#13;
sanitation (public and demonstration latrines), hygiene education and management development. Water Action&#13;
carried out a baseline survey to enable planning and to use for later evaluation. The proposal was submitted to&#13;
ESRDF with Woreda endorsement, and then subject to negotiation as part of appraisal.&#13;

Even though recent figures suggest that the community role in sub-project initiation has improved&#13;
drastically, however, there are problems with clarity on the exact numbers of people to be served by each&#13;
sub-project.&#13;

Sub-project Appraisal: The guidance provided in the RWSS Handbook with its Technical and&#13;

Box 3.4: Number of People Served&#13;
&#13;
During the Mid Term Review (MTR) in June 1999, an analysis was made of the effective numbers of users for&#13;
schemes. This resulted in an estimation that slightly above 40 percent of the apparent beneficiaries are not Ã¢&#128;&#147; in all&#13;
likelihood Ã¢&#128;&#147; benefiting from an improved service; just less than 60 percent may be real users. This analysis was based&#13;
on the RWSS Handbook/Technical Design Manual guidelines, i.e. 350 people can be served from a handpump, 400 from&#13;
a point source spring protection, and for more complex schemes, 900 people per 6 tap water point. Those standards&#13;
represent the more generous estimation of the maximum numbers of people that schemes are able to serve (for&#13;
example 200 per hand dug well is the SAR maximum, and 250 is a widely accepted international standard for the&#13;
same). The MTR found a disturbing difference between the two sets of Ã¢&#128;&#152;beneficiariesÃ¢&#128;&#153; in virtually all regions, which&#13;
also matched with the findings of the ESRDF Construction Quality and O&amp;M Evaluation Report.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Sub-project Construction : Average unit costs and cost per capita for completed schemes have remained&#13;
largely within the guidelines developed at the time of design and inception of the ESRDF program. There&#13;
are, however, two cost efficiency issues currently prominent in ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s RWSS component: (i) some&#13;
regions seem to favor a technology selection which leads to very high costs per capita Ã¢&#128;&#147; these are&#13;
generally large and technically complex schemes, and (ii) many schemes do not have a reliable figure of&#13;
actual users Ã¢&#128;&#147; often over -estimated at preparation/appraisal Ã¢&#128;&#147; giving the impression that cost per capita is&#13;
low and that a high number of people is served.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Box 3.5: Preparation/Appraisal&#13;
&#13;
Many project proposals are detailed only in so far as the civil works is concerned, and hence appraisal forms are&#13;
generally not completed in sufficient detail on which to base a recommendation, particularly with respect to cost&#13;
recovery. An extract of the appraisal form for the Walargi motorised borehole and distribution scheme in Chiro&#13;
Woreda, Oromiya Region is given below:&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢ Assess cost per beneficiary and compare with existing standards. [No answer]&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢ Does the community benefiting from the project have a committee set -up which will be responsible for&#13;
    managing and maintaining the facility? At the moment only a CPC is formed to follow the progress of the project proposal&#13;
    and implementation process. I propose to use the CPC for future management and maintenance of the scheme. Beneficiary&#13;
    community shall be advised.&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢ Verify the commitment of any concerned department to handle the major repairs of water supply schemes. The&#13;
    Zonal WMERD is committed to assist the beneficiary community in the project implementation and future management.&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢ Assess and suggest if there is need for training of beneficiaries for effective participation in project&#13;
    implementation and for future management and maintenance of the sub-project. Training of selected community&#13;
    members for the effective participation of the beneficiary community in the project implementation and future management is needed.&#13;

Box 3.6: Comparing Costs&#13;
&#13;
A number of factors may affect the overall cost of water supply schemes and more importantly the cost per user.&#13;
These factors make comparisons difficult and often misleading.&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢ Durability - The design life of individual schemes needs to be assessed when calculating the cost per&#13;
    beneficiary. A well-constructed scheme using appropriate and locally available technology/ material may easily&#13;
    last 50 to 100 years with little or no maintenance whereas cheaper high tech, quick fix solutions may not be so&#13;
    durable under harsh conditions.&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢ Location - access to and quality of individual water sources, availability of building materials, rock and soil&#13;
    types are among location specific factors that affect the final cost of facilities.&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢ Socio-economic - cultural practices vary considerably from region to region. Methods used to collect and&#13;
    transport water may differ widely. Water may be carried by humans or pack animals depending on economic&#13;
    and geographic circumstances. Therefore, specific designs need to accommodate alternative practices.&#13;
&#13;

Some projects have served as examples of best practice.&#13;
&#13;
Box 3.7: Best Practice&#13;
The project proposal for the Anole scheme in Gurage Zone, SNNPRS Region, was developed in collaboration&#13;
between an elected Watsan committee and a local NGO, Water Action. A baseline survey was conducted for planing&#13;
and later evaluation purposes, and the proposal was submitted to ESRDF with Woreda endorsement. Appraisal was&#13;
Ã¢&#128;&#152;easyÃ¢&#128;&#153; as the proposal was comprehensive and thoroughly prepared. Most issues had been discussed up-front with&#13;
the community including future management requirements. Cost per capita is about Birr 160 Ã¢&#128;&#147; Ã¢&#128;&#152;normalÃ¢&#128;&#153; for this type&#13;
of scheme, covered (14%) by community. O&amp;M costs will be low and justifies an increased community share of&#13;
costs. Implementation is carrie d out by Water Action in partnership with community with technical supervision&#13;
provided by WMERD department. The project has a steering committee with Zonal WMERRD, health bureau&#13;
(Woreda and Zonal department), Woreda Council and Water Action among members. In addition to water supply&#13;
facilities: 3 public latrines and 12 traditional pit latrines constructed; 8,294 people have attended hygiene education&#13;
events (conducted by seconded health bureau staff). Community identified 25 Ã¢&#128;&#152;techniciansÃ¢&#128;&#153; at project start for&#13;
training by Water Action. Trainees were assessed by WatSan committee and by Water Action Ã¢&#128;&#147; now assigned and&#13;
given additional training to serve as Water Administration Office (WAO) staff and Water Point (WP) tap attendants.&#13;
For management of O&amp;M, a Water Board is established with membership comprising project steering committee, 4&#13;
PAs representatives, 5 WatSan committee members, clinic and school staff, and Woreda representative. An&#13;
Executive Committee meets once every 2 weeks to direct and oversee activities of the WAO. Water tariffs/charges:&#13;
Birr 0.05 per 20 litres / Birr 2.50 per m3; WAO staff and WP attendants receive salary: Birr 60-100 per month. No&#13;
payment, however, to Board and Executive Committee members Ã¢&#128;&#147; is this Ã¢&#128;&#152;voluntarismÃ¢&#128;&#153; sustainable?&#13;

&#13;
4.1.      Policy Debates&#13;
&#13;
4.1.1.    Short-term Policies versus Long-term Goals&#13;
&#13;
One of the biggest challenges facing social funds is the reconciliation of short-term and long-goals&#13;
(Frigenti and Harth, 1998), especially between the pressure to finish projects quickly and the longer&#13;
period needed to ensure ownership and social sustainability through the involvement of the beneficiary&#13;
communities. The social fund in Ethiopia started in 1992 as an emergency measure with the pilot ESRF&#13;
which began as a component of the Ethiopian Recovery and Rehabilitation Program (ERRP) in 1992, and&#13;
subsequently evolved into a nationwide fund under ESRDF. While the ESRF focused on support for&#13;
water and sanitation facilities, the ESRDF has as one of its main objectives to Ã¢&#128;&#156;promote a community-&#13;
based approach in project identification, preparation, implementation, administration and maintenanceÃ¢&#128;&#157;.&#13;
Overall, the findings of RWSS supervision missions have been generally positive in terms of observed&#13;
functionality and utilization, but the safeguarding of long -term sustainability is not yet satisfactory. The&#13;
identified short-comings, especially in the areas of project preparation/appraisal and management&#13;
development for operation and maintenance, need to be addressed. It has also been observed that&#13;
pressure for rapid implementation is strengthened where private contractors are used, often resulting in&#13;
compromise of community participation, including agreed contributions.&#13;
&#13;
The ESRDF has made a conscious effort to extend the lessons learned to wider government operations&#13;
for strategies to integrate DRA in sector institutions, decentralization, private sector participation and&#13;
transparent procurement and disbursement procedures. In addition to day -to-day contact between&#13;
ESRDF staff and sector institutions at regional and zonal levels, two key workshops (ASR, 1999) and&#13;
(ESRDF, 2002b) have been held with joint participation of ESRDF RWSS staff and national, regional,&#13;
and zonal sector professionals:&#13;

&#13;
4.1.2.    Links with Decentralization&#13;
&#13;
The constitutionally mandated governance structure in Ethiopia consists of four tiers: the region, the&#13;
zone, the woreda (similar to district) with technical units formally accountable to an elected council, and&#13;
the kebele, with an assembly if community representatives managed by an executive.&#13;
&#13;
The objectives of the WRM Policy are in line with the Federal Government policy of decentralization.&#13;
The woreda, in line with regional constitutions and strategies, will be the centre for planning and&#13;
implementation of projects, including the appraisal of requests. The horizontal linkages of the new&#13;
woreda water desks with local administrations and other sectoral agencies like health, agriculture and&#13;
education and NGOs will need to be defined, as well as the vertical linkages with the zone and region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       20&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                 Rapid Assessment Of ESRDF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Some regions have already initiated woreda water desks manned by Woreda Water Desk Officers, but in&#13;
general a sustainable organizational structure and manpower requirement for each woreda water desk will&#13;
need to be developed.&#13;
&#13;
Two important aspects of Bank support for local governance are social funds, which seek to target and&#13;
empower poor communities to improve participation and local service delivery, and support to&#13;
governments committed to decentralization of responsibility and power for local development to local&#13;
governments and other local institutions. There are concerns that these two approaches, which address&#13;
different elements of governance, may sometimes work at cross-purposes (Parker and Serrano, 2000). For&#13;
example, if social funds establish parallel channels for local expenditures and community participation&#13;
without building proper channels for local accountability or financial sustainability, they can weaken&#13;
nascent local governments and impede decentralization efforts. Conversely, if decentralization programs&#13;
build financially health local governments without provisions for orienting spending to the poor, they will&#13;
be at odds with social fund efforts of increasing access to the poor to local services and infrastructure.&#13;
However, it is possible, as brought out by Parker and Serrano (2000) that these will be complementary if&#13;
Ã¢&#128;&#156;key decentralization policy reforms are in place and the social fund is aligned with themÃ¢&#128;&#157;.&#13;
&#13;
ESRDF has been piloting a Woreda Development Fund (WDF) since June 2000 in four woredas of&#13;
Amhara region. The WDF is now operating in a new policy environment, as the GovernmentÃ¢&#128;&#153;s&#13;
development strategy was recently refocused towards governance and empowerment. Regarding&#13;
empowerment, the Government indicated its plan to support the rapid transfer of untied resources to&#13;
municipalities, woredas and kebeles through a system of block grants to promote more demand-&#13;
responsive, efficient and sustainable delivery of services. As the regions will progressively provide block&#13;
grants to woredas, the niche of the WDF would need to be defined, as well as the complementary&#13;
capacity building activities of woredas and kebeles to assume the block grant responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
As an institution that traditionally targets the poor or remote communities, ESRDF could provide direct&#13;
supplemental resources to the poorest woredas and kebeles (without an offsetting effect: the sub-projects&#13;
financed being added to the capital budget of these local governments). I       n addition, ESRDF, as an&#13;
autonomous government entity specialized in bottom-up approaches of project identification,&#13;
formulation and implementation, could transfer this knowledge to woredas and kebeles, and this would&#13;
probably be better achieved through the transfer of block grants or matching grants. The resource&#13;
transfer would need to be tied to the availability of development plans using participatory processes.&#13;
&#13;
Local governments, and specifically woredas, are mostly deconcentrated units rather than genuine,&#13;
democratically elected executives in their own right, and this form of administrative deconcentration has&#13;
hindered the development of democratic and accountable local governments, capable of delivering&#13;
services in a demand responsive and sustainable manner. To address this problem, the Government has&#13;
requested the BankÃ¢&#128;&#153;s assistance to increase the capacity of local governments through the Capacity&#13;
Building for Decentralized Service Delivery (CBDSD) project, which is under preparation. The proposed&#13;
ESRDF second phase would complement the efforts of the CBDSD Project by enhancing the capacity of&#13;
woredas to empower communities and to develop bottom-up development programs, and the CBDSD&#13;
would help transfer ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s experience of community driven development to woredas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    21&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                               Rapid Assessment Of ESRDF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In a continuation of the pilot WDF, the proposed ESRDF 2 will finance kebele-requested sub-projects&#13;
through block grants to woredas, which are expected to follow bottom-up mechanisms for identification,&#13;
implementation and monitoring, based on ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s experience. To be eligible, woredas will need to meet&#13;
the criteria identified under the CBDSD project such as evidence of ability for fiscal and financial&#13;
management, including statement of accounts for at least two preceding years. In addition, woredas will&#13;
need to meet poverty related criteria (to be defined). If these targets are met, local governments can&#13;
absorb ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s resources into its budget, and budget process for the financing of its capital investment&#13;
plan. The CBDSD project is expected to provide financing for complementary capacity building of&#13;
woredas in terms of financial management, procurement and technical skills, as well as support for&#13;
budgeting recurrent spending for investment sub -projects. It is expected that some woredas will be&#13;
able to graduate from the ESRDF, and receive a larger proportion of transfers from the region as&#13;
untied grant. Criteria for mainstreaming the WDF into regional governments will include preserving and&#13;
improving on the participatory identification of priority investments, woredasÃ¢&#128;&#153; compliance with basic&#13;
financial and procurement regulations, and retention of officers.&#13;
&#13;
The draft basic mechanism of the Woreda Development Fund is proposed as follows (World Bank,&#13;
2002a):&#13;
&#13;
    1. WDF Guidelines will be prepared by ESDRF for the purpose of managing the WDF. The&#13;
    Guidelines will be appended and refer to ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s Operational Manual and would specify, inter alia:&#13;
    principles, procedures and mechanism for use of the funds, selection, implementation, monitoring&#13;
    and evaluation of sub-projects, criteria for selection of woredas, communities, projects, etc.&#13;
&#13;
    2. Representative of the ESRDF and of the selected Woreda Council would sign a WDF Financing&#13;
    Agreement (FA) at the beginning of the campaign, defining duties and responsibilities of each party,&#13;
    procedures, financial amounts and mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
    3. The Woreda Council creates a WDF coordination committee (WDF-CC) responsible for&#13;
    facilitating the technical implementation of WDF activities. The Guidelines will specify a mechanism&#13;
    allowing adequate separation of powers and avoiding duplication of institutional bodies at woreda&#13;
    level.&#13;
&#13;
    4. ESRDF and the Woreda (WDF-CC and Woreda Administration) would promote the principles&#13;
    and mechanism of WDF to communities, sector bureaus and local facilitators.&#13;
&#13;
    5. The communities present their proposals via their Kebele. The Kebele will discuss, collate and&#13;
    prioritize the proposals and submit the resulting Ã¢&#128;&#156;local development planÃ¢&#128;&#157; (LDP) to the WDF-CC.&#13;
&#13;
    6. WDF-CC records, screens, analyzes and collate the LDPs into a Woreda Development Plan&#13;
    (WDP). It then prioritizes and recommends proposals for approval, on the basis of OMÃ¢&#128;&#153;s eligibility&#13;
    criteria and appraisal procedures.&#13;
&#13;
    7. The Woreda Council, which meets quarterly, approves (or rejects) the proposals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  22&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                   Rapid Assessment Of ESRDF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    8. RO confirms that the selection criteria and appraisal process satisfy ESRDF-WDF standards,&#13;
    OM and specific guidelines. (RO staff may participate in the appraisal process, particularly in field&#13;
    visits).&#13;
&#13;
    9. On the basis of RO endorsement, ESRDF will transfer the first installment of funds to the&#13;
    woreda-administration Ã¢&#128;&#152;WDF accountÃ¢&#128;&#153; or to the communities.&#13;
&#13;
    10. WDF-CC will, in collaboration with woreda/zone/region sectoral offices prepare detailed&#13;
    technical design and engineering plans, bill of quantities, cost estimates, technical tender documents,&#13;
    etc. ESRDF will provide on-demand support and external contractor can be hired under WDF sub-&#13;
    project funding for ad-hoc support.&#13;
&#13;
    11. Tendering process is launched by WDF-CC in collaboration with CPC. The results of the&#13;
    selection committee are approved by the Woreda Exec-Comm and displayed publicly.&#13;
&#13;
    12. Implementation arrangements follow with close involvement of the communities:&#13;
&#13;
             n   FA is signed between the Woreda Administration and the community (CPC)&#13;
&#13;
             n   The community mobilizes its contribution&#13;
&#13;
             n   Implementation contract is signed between the community and the contractor&#13;
&#13;
             n   The woreda transfers the funds to the community&#13;
&#13;
             n   Payments are effected by the community (endorsed by the woreda?)&#13;
&#13;
             n   The contractor and/or the community begin the implementation&#13;
&#13;
             n   CPC monitors implementation and refers to WDF-CC (and to ESRDF if need be)&#13;
&#13;
             n   WDF-CC monitor implementation and produce progress reports addressed to both the&#13;
                 relevant community and ESRDF as well as for public display at woreda level&#13;
&#13;
             n   RO supervises the whole process randomly (RO staff may assist as observer at any step of the&#13;
                 process)&#13;
&#13;
    13. Upon completion of the project, hand-over will be realized according to the OM. WDF-CC will&#13;
    submit a post -completion report for every project after three months of its completion (provisional&#13;
    hand-over) specifying status and use of the infrastructure or services realized. ESRDF RO will follow&#13;
    with its own post completion report.&#13;
&#13;
4.1.3.   RWSS Sector Reforms and Case for a specialized WSS Fund&#13;
&#13;
The WRM Policy provides for grant support to RWSS, although with a part of the investment cost to be&#13;
met by the user communities. Rather than funding these grants for RWSS through regular capital budgets&#13;
in each region, ESRDF could become the grant Ã¢&#128;&#152;windowÃ¢&#128;&#153; of the overall financing mechanism for RWSS&#13;
&#13;
                                                     23&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        Rapid Assessment Of ESRDF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
in Ethiopia. With community contribution already well established and an administration used to&#13;
promote, appraise and assist implementation of RWSS projects, this option would deserve serious&#13;
consideration.&#13;
&#13;
4.2.     Institutional Issues&#13;
&#13;
4.2.1.   Coordination with sector institutions and local authorities&#13;
&#13;
The Minister of Water Resources is a member of the ESRDF Board at central level, and Heads of&#13;
Regional Water Bureaus act as technical advisers to Regional Steering Committees. Zonal WMERD&#13;
Departments are involved in preparation of proposals, detailed design and construction supervision.&#13;
During 1996-99 the MOWR prepared a comprehensive Federal Water Policy and issues related to RWS&#13;
&#13;
   Box 4.1: Zonal Water Department&#13;
&#13;
   South Wollo Zonal WMERD Department was nominated the Implementing Agency for 12, 25 and 20 ESRDF&#13;
   point source water projects for the FYs 19996/97, -97/98 and Ã¢&#128;&#147;98/99 respectively. The Zonal department&#13;
   decided to give about half of these projects to ORDA (an NGO linked to the State) for implementation. In&#13;
   addition, the Zonal department was responsible for the implementation of other government financed projects&#13;
   Ã¢&#128;&#147; 18 of different typology last year Ã¢&#128;&#147; as well as 16 with SIDA financing. The staffing included: 2 Water&#13;
   Engineers (BSc), 1 Hydrogeologist, 3 Technicians (Foremen / Site Supervisors), 2 Community Promoters, 1&#13;
   Mechanic and 1 Electrician. Daily laborers and artisans are hired as required for construction and O&amp;M tasks.&#13;
   Material is always supplied to site by the Zonal department for their projects. The major capacity constraints&#13;
   include shortage of personnel, lack of construction equipment and limited transport facilities. With ESRDF&#13;
   assistance 15 artisans have been trained in SPD and HDW construction. These have been hired by the Zonal&#13;
   department to organize / execute most of the work on site. So far the Mechanic has installed the handpumps Ã¢&#128;&#147;&#13;
   often assisted by the artisans. The Zonal head agreed that it would be feasible and desirable to provide some of&#13;
   the artisans with sufficient training to become small scale contractors.&#13;
   Source: Lium and Ratcliffe (1998a)&#13;
&#13;
were addressed. At the same time, the MOWR was actively involved in reviewing the draft ESRDF RWSS&#13;
Handbook and Manuals, and initially raised the issue of ESRDF encroachment on its sector mandate but&#13;
this was resolved amicably and laid the ground for enhanced collaboration. RWS is currently dependent&#13;
on mainly the zonal WMERD departments for new development, rehabilitation and O&amp;M support.&#13;
Other important actors include parastatal construction companies, NGOs linked to the State, private&#13;
contractors and other independent NGOs. For sanitation and health/hygiene related issues the Health&#13;
Bureau / Department are the important actor and coordinator. Whilst some functions and limited&#13;
backstopping are provided by the Regional WMERD Bureau, most services for RWS are expected to be&#13;
available from the Zonal department, except for construction tasks taken on or contracted by the other&#13;
partners. These services include virtually all technical and management training, except where&#13;
independent NGOs provide the whole implementation Ã¢&#128;&#152;packageÃ¢&#128;&#153;. The question is how and to what extent&#13;
it is practically possible for the Zonal departments to undertake their designed Ã¢&#128;&#147; or assumed Ã¢&#128;&#147; role.&#13;
&#13;
Except for a few sub-units established for daily O&amp;M of urban and small town schemes, there is generally&#13;
no representation at further decentralized levels, though some of the larger regions, e.g. Amhara, have&#13;
deployed water officers in some woredas. ESRDF needs to find improved and more consistently&#13;
institutionalized ways of working with the water and health bureaus/departments. Improvements have&#13;
been noted and the new Woreda Water Desk Officers, together with the Sanitarians at woreda level,&#13;
provide additional opportunities to strengthen dialogue and secure enhanced quality.&#13;
&#13;
                                                             24&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         Rapid Assessment Of ESRDF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Box 4.2: Woreda Water Desk&#13;
&#13;
   The water sector is currently preparing for implementation of a re-structuring process, in which most&#13;
   functions will be decentralized to woreda level. In Amhara Region, for example, it is proposed that staffing of&#13;
   a typical woreda water desk office would comprise: 1 team leader, 2 maintenance technicians, 1&#13;
   hydrogeologist, 1 water quality specialist, 1 community participation specialist and 1 mines and energy&#13;
   specialist, while functions remaining at zonal level would include water quality (with equipped laboratory) and&#13;
   some aspects of hydrogeology / hydraulic engineering. Around 50 percent of the proposed woreda personnel&#13;
   requirement can be filled by the current zone staffing, and the MOWR has a plan to establish a regional&#13;
   training centre to train new technicians/plumbers, and to distribute the current spare parts stocked at zonal&#13;
   level between each woreda.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Within the water sector it is recognized that the absence of a water structure at the woreda level is a bottleneck&#13;
to the planning, implementation, and operation and maintenance of rural water supply sub-projects. Woreda&#13;
Water Desks are gradually being introduced and some regions are more advanced in the process than others.&#13;
Under a possible ESRDF second phase, it is currently proposed (ESRDF, 2002a) that the following capacity&#13;
building activities be introduced in 55 selected woredas: (i) provision of equipment and tools and human&#13;
resource development, (ii) strengthening of community participation and promotion teams, (iii) strengthening&#13;
capacity of community based structures, e.g. woreda water committees and, (iv) provision of establishment fund&#13;
for spare parts stocking centre.&#13;
&#13;
In the SNNP Region, a model has been developed, and is being implemented in some woredas,&#13;
particularly those with a high element of community contracting, in which a main CPC (Community&#13;
Project Committee) at woreda level represents sub-CPCs at individual point source sub-projects&#13;
(Mekonnen, 2001). The main CPC at woreda level has 5-7 committee members, some drawn from&#13;
representation of individual point source CPCs, and one from the woreda administration council (social&#13;
sector), one from woreda health office and one from woreda development association. The committee is&#13;
chaired by the member from the woreda council social affairs. Duties and responsibilities of the main&#13;
CPC at woreda level include:&#13;
&#13;
     Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Withdraw from financial institution the transferred funds from the ESRDF office and deposit&#13;
          community contribution share on the request of the sub -CPCs as endorsed by the woreda&#13;
          council.&#13;
&#13;
     Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Procure materials and skilled labour as per ESRDF procedure following the request of the sub-&#13;
          CPCs as endorsed by the sanitarian and woreda council.&#13;
&#13;
     Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Supervise sub-projects on a regular basis.&#13;
&#13;
     Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Undertake settlement of financial expenses with ESRDF regional office.&#13;
&#13;
     Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Report on physical and financial performance of the sub-projects to the ESRDF regional office&#13;
          on a regular basis.&#13;
&#13;
     Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Mobilize community contribution as per agreed format with assistance of sub-CPCs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

     Ã¢&#128;Â¢   Collaborate with woreda health office, and facilitate heath and environmental education program&#13;
         through the sanitarian.&#13;
&#13;
Members of a sub-CPC are required to be direct scheme beneficiaries and to be living in the kebele where&#13;
the sub -project is located. The average committee size is around 3 and includes the scheme caretaker and&#13;
a representative of the elders. Main duties and responsibilities of the sub-CPCs at point source level are:&#13;
&#13;
    Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Mobilize the required and agreed community contribution from the benefiting communities.&#13;
&#13;
    Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Safeguard the long-term sustainability of the scheme by undertaking preventive mainte nance&#13;
         (through the caretaker) and assist the sanitarian and kebele health committee during health and&#13;
         sanitation education.&#13;
&#13;
    Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Recruit caretakers from the benefiting community.&#13;
&#13;
    Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Conduct meetings with the users regarding the working hours of the scheme, collection of water&#13;
         fees and on weekly turn of scheme keeping.&#13;
&#13;
    Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Report scheme failures to the main committee for assistance.&#13;
&#13;
    Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Resolve minor disputes that may arise among users in qualifying for water usage and if the&#13;
         problem is serious to report to the kebele for further action.&#13;

In July 1996 the Tigray Regional Council issued Proclamation No.19/88 for the Establishment of Urban&#13;
and Rural Water Services Ã¢&#128;&#147; Section 5, Articles 20-25 are related to the organization of rural water&#13;
committees and legalize the role and authority of community water committees for O&amp;M of community&#13;
water supplies. Similar legislation has since been replicated in some of the other regions. In Oromiya, the&#13;
Water Committees and Water Boards are legal entities that are accountable to the beneficia ry community&#13;
and the WMERD department. A Water Committee/Board can open a bank account and can sue or be&#13;
sued on behalf of water supply schemes.&#13;
&#13;
4.2.2.   Stakeholder participation in ESRDF governance&#13;
&#13;
Civil society and NGOs are not represented on the ESRDF Board, and the General Manager is appointed&#13;
by Government. Civic organizations, however, are represented on the Regional Steering Committees. In&#13;
the decentralized ESRDF environment, the central office provides technical support to regional offices,&#13;
which are responsible for the day -to-day ESRDF operations in each region.&#13;
&#13;
4.2.3.   Capacity building and software support&#13;
&#13;
The sustainability of project interventions and durability of physical infrastructures requires the program&#13;
approach and hardware components to be socia lly acceptable, technically suitable and, above all,&#13;
affordable by beneficiary communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the rush to complete the physical implementation of RWSS services many of the 'software'&#13;
components listed in the box below have been overlooked or underestimated, resulting in implementation&#13;
constraints as well as more rapid deterioration in the quality and durability of services.&#13;
&#13;
Revised cost guidelines were drafted in May 2000 to include budget provisions for software components, i.e.&#13;
study, design, capacity building, health and sanitation. Up to that point, ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s investment in software&#13;
of RWSS sub-projects had remained minimal, and budgeted costs did not adequately include software&#13;
costs because:&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢   Emphasis was placed on rapid physical implementation of sub-projects&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢   Software items were wrongly perceived as cost-inflating inputs&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢   Hygiene education and sanitation had not been well integrated with RWS Ã¢&#128;&#147; ESRDF worked almost&#13;
    exclusively with Community Participation and Promotion Officers (CPPOs) of the regional water&#13;
    bureaus but needed also to work with regional health bureaus which have representation at lower&#13;
    levels.&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢   The OM assumed that ESRDF would appraise and finance sub -projects for which studies and&#13;
    designs had already been carried out by the requesting agency or community.&#13;
&#13;
It was envisaged that incorporating all community level training and capacity building in the sub-project&#13;
budget would enable:&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢   Better packaged, timely and on-site delivery, thereby avoiding the previous practice of training large&#13;
    groups at regional level, which was negatively impacting on the quality and timing of training&#13;
&#13;
Ã¢&#128;Â¢   Provision of different forms of training and capacity building, suited to the requirements at different&#13;
    stages in the project cycle thereby avoiding the previous practice of considering such activities as&#13;

Box 4.4: Quality and Timing of Training&#13;
&#13;
At Benker hand dug well, Amhara, the lack of initial capacity building and training have led to a lack of&#13;
involvement of the community and to a technical option that does not satisfy needs. The training of the&#13;
caretaker at Regional level came too late to help solve this, and the community are still unsure of O&amp;M and&#13;
have not discussed recurrent costs and user fees. It is also easy for community members to Ã¢&#128;&#152;withdrawÃ¢&#128;&#153; as&#13;
there are alternative sources, notably (and surprisingly) a stone masonry traditional well next to the hand dug&#13;
well.&#13;

In SNNP region a total of 430 people had attended caretaker training workshops in Awassa, and 40 CPC&#13;
members a bid opening workshop in Awassa. At Dilla Anferera and Doya shallow drilled well sites visited, it&#13;
was clear that much training and capacity building were still needed at site level in management, O&amp;M&#13;

There are different requirements for community training and capacity building between those needed&#13;
for implementation and those for sustained operation and maintenance. Indeed, even the&#13;
composition of the CPC may need to change between these two stages; - the leadership and drive&#13;
required from members of the CPC to get a sub -project off the ground may vary from the skills&#13;
needed to sustain a scheme in the long term.&#13;

 At Kurasekel Esifanos spring protection development in South Gondar Zone, Amhara, the CPC had&#13;
 effectively collapsed on completion of the sub-project. The community explained that it was difficult to&#13;
 sustain the CPC once their implementation duties were discharged Ã¢&#128;&#147; they had stopped collecting user fees,&#13;
 so could not pay the caretaker. One member of the CPC had died, another had left the area, and no&#13;
 mechanisms existed to elect a new committee.&#13;

  meets monthly on general matters, twice a week on finance matters, and reports quarterly in writing to the&#13;
  WMERD. As the WC members and pump operator gain more day-to-day experience of running the&#13;
  scheme they requested for refresher training which would go into more detail of O&amp;M aspects.&#13;

loans provided to them by ADA, encouraged to tender and take up construction contracts in accordance with&#13;
their capacity. The initial phase of the training and capacity building amounted to ETB 234,000. A second phase&#13;
of similar arrangement is in progress to train technicians in blue print reading, quantity take-off and cost&#13;
estimation. The ESRDF support for the second phase is ETB 600,000. The program could be expanded to&#13;

4.2.4.    Contracting and resource management&#13;
&#13;
Especially in the earlier years of ESRDF, the lack of WMERD, voluntary organization and private sector&#13;
capacity led in some regions to the award of direct contracts rather than a more cost effective, transparent&#13;
method of competitive bidding being followed.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Box 4.10: Contracting Procedures&#13;
&#13;
  After the approval of 198 RWS sub-projects in Amhara, the RO advertised through each WMERD zonal&#13;
  department for interested contractors to register with ESRDF for works, but no contractors responded. As the&#13;
  RO Procurement Officer had not been appointed at the time, a committee composed of the WMERD Regional&#13;
  Bureau Head and Heads of Design and Planning, Construction, Procurement and Services and the ESRDF RWS&#13;
  PO met to decide how to proceed with implementation. As a result, 41 spring developments/hand dug wells&#13;
  were awarded by direct contract to ERO, 146 spring developments/hand dug wells were distributed among the&#13;
  WMERD zonal departments and 11 drilled wells were awarded to the Amhara Water Works Construction&#13;
  Enterprise.&#13;
&#13;
  Source: Lium et al. (1997)&#13;
&#13;
The above was adopted because the ESRDF Amhara RO wanted to implement the RWS sub-projects&#13;
during the 1996/97 dry season. It feared that any delay, such as the time required to advertise nationally,&#13;
could result in no sub -projects being implemented during the current financial year.&#13;
&#13;
Batching of sub-projects can ensure economies of scale in capacity building and software support for sub-&#13;
project development, though care needs to be taken to strike a balance between size which is large&#13;
enough to ensure eco monies of scale yet small enough to match the capacity of local firms to tender.&#13;
&#13;
Low private sector capacity for implementation of schemes; ESRDF has tried to increase the involvement&#13;
of local small scale contractors and artisans, where possible through direct community contracting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Box 4.11: Low Private Sector Capacity&#13;
&#13;
There are groups of local masons and technicians in Amhara who have expressed interest in forming small&#13;
contracting firms to work specifically in the RWS sector on low-cost, simple to maintain technologies like&#13;
spring development and hand dug well construction. In most cases they are individuals who have a background&#13;
in RWS through governmental and voluntary organisations. The two main problems that these individuals have&#13;
encountered in trying to establish their firms is the difficulty in obtaining a formal licence from the Ministry of&#13;
Works for small scale RWS specific work, and their lack of capital to make an initial purchase of transport and&#13;
well digging equipment such as ring moulds, tripods, chain blocks etc.&#13;
&#13;

There is, however, a general reluctance to rely on communities/CBOs for direct implementation&#13;
(contracting) as quality assurance and Ã¢&#128;&#152;accountabilityÃ¢&#128;&#153; has been put in doubt. The community role in&#13;
contracting has been limited as rationalization of implementation has not been obvious, ignoring the&#13;
important empowerment aspect, though there are exceptions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Box 4.12: Community Role in Contracting&#13;
&#13;
SNNP region has implemented a consistent system of making the community, represented by the Community&#13;
Project Committee (CPC), the client for the sub-project. The CPC participated in the tender opening /&#13;
evaluation and had their own supervisors posted by ESRDF. This had a positive effect on how project&#13;
ownership was conceived Ã¢&#128;&#147; beyond just a Ã¢&#128;&#152;sense of ownershipÃ¢&#128;&#153; often talked about.&#13;

development (Mekonnen, 2001). Average cost per capita for completed schemes has been found to be 35&#13;
percent cheaper than those constructed by private contractors, and community contribution has also been&#13;
found to be much higher for the community contracted schemes. In addition, the following limitations&#13;
were found when using private contractors:&#13;
&#13;
    Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Private contractors were reluctant to participate in small projects as the small volume of work&#13;
         and geographical location was not attractive.&#13;
&#13;
    Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Under-valuation of community contributions by contractors led to repetitive, time consuming,&#13;
         negotiations regarding payment.&#13;
&#13;
    Ã¢&#128;Â¢    Community contributions could not always be provided as per the contractors work schedule,&#13;
         and in many cases contractors uni-laterally undertook the activity thereby limiting the community&#13;
         contribution.&#13;

4.2.5.   Impact monitoring and evaluation of WSS sub-projects&#13;
&#13;
The MIS and stored data are used almost exclusively for the tracking of projects from inception through&#13;
to completion, final hand -over and beyond. Evaluations have however highlighted the need for&#13;
improved analysis; potential exists for using the MIS to improve individual project performance. To fill&#13;
some of the current gaps in the Ã¢&#128;&#152;officialÃ¢&#128;&#153; MIS, the ESRDF CO RWSS Team is maintaining its own parallel&#13;
data base in order to reflect important details such as Ã¢&#128;&#152;batchedÃ¢&#128;&#153; sub -projects comprising more than one&#13;
installation (e.g. 2 HDWs or 3 SDWs + 1 SPD). Th       is area of monitoring and evaluation requirements&#13;
certainly needs to be explored in far greater detail.&#13;
&#13;
The estimated cost data on the RWSS database were made at the time of appraisal in accordance with the&#13;
guidelines only. Data on actual costs are only available for 852 (52%) out of 1,642 completed schemes.&#13;
Even taking into account the retention payment to be made at the end of a contract maintenance period,&#13;
there is still a substantial time-lag between completion of a scheme and recording of actual expend iture.&#13;
The beneficiary data also needs further revision, in particular the apparent overestimation of the real&#13;
numbers of users. For more complex systems Ã¢&#128;&#147; motorised boreholes and distribution schemes Ã¢&#128;&#147; the&#13;
number of water points needs careful revision. This information provides an important indication of how&#13;
adequately the system is designed Ã¢&#128;&#147; is it able to adequately serve the number of users? Only 44 out of 145&#13;
completed schemes have such information, and the revision of data needs to be comprehensive and&#13;
systematic.&#13;

4.3.     Sustainability of WSS Sub -Projects&#13;
&#13;
4.3.1.   Community cost sharing&#13;
&#13;
ESRDF is a demand-based program, and finances only sub-projects that are community-initiat ed and suitable&#13;
for community management. For each sub-project, the benefiting group or community forms a Community&#13;
Project Committee (CPC) which participates actively in identifying, preparing, appraising and implementing&#13;
                                ll contractual arrangements with the ESRDF. The CPC is also responsible for&#13;
sub-projects, and is a party to a&#13;
collecting community contributions (not less than 10 percent in cash, kind or labor) to the capital costs of the&#13;
sub-project, and (often through a newly elected Water Committee which replaces the original CPC) for&#13;
managing the maintenance of facilities through user fees, and other contributions. In practice, high-tech schemes&#13;
(e.g. borehole drilling) have limited the scope for off-setting community contributions; unskilled labour inputs&#13;
and payments in kind are less.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Box 4.14: Community Contribution&#13;
&#13;
   At Walargi motorized borehole and distribution scheme in Chiro Woreda, Oromiya, the scheme had been&#13;
   operational for 15 days at the time of the SPN mission visit, but only 15 percent of the Ã¢&#128;&#152;minimumÃ¢&#128;&#153; 10 percent&#13;
   community contribution had been collected. Birr 1,000 in cash had been deposited in a bank account in Chiro,&#13;
   some 32 km from Walargi, and Birr 5,880 was in the form of material contribution. It was noted, however, that&#13;
   the in-kind community labor contribution for trench excavation and backfilling, construction of access road etc,&#13;
   had not yet been quantified in cash terms. The CPC members expected the outstanding community cash&#13;
   contribution to be paid after the harvest, but it may be difficult to collect the outstanding contributions now&#13;
   that the construction work is finished. A problem may be faced when having to make the retention payment to&#13;
   the contractor on expiry of the current maintenance period.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
It has also proved difficult in many cases to convince communities of the need to collect water charges to&#13;
support O&amp;M, it seems necessary to insist on a cash part of community contribution to investment.&#13;
&#13;
   Box 4.15: User Fee for O&amp;M&#13;
&#13;
   In Tula-mino Kebele, Gola-oda Woreda of East Hararghe Zone, drilling and construction work for 5 shallow&#13;
   drilled wells with handpumps was contracted to the Oromiya Water Works Construction Enterprise for a&#13;
   Contract Price of Birr 273,750. In practice, only 3 shallow wells were drilled and installed with handpumps,&#13;
   while one deep borehole was drilled to 120 m and it was planned to install a motorised pump as the yield was&#13;
   found to be 6 l/s (22 m 3/hr). Although the handpumps had been installed for 8 months, only 55 percent of the&#13;
   minimum 10 percent community contribution had been collected. This comprised the equivalent of Birr 14,400&#13;
   in labor. The cash equivalent for erection of a Ã¢&#128;&#152;liveÃ¢&#128;&#153; fence by the community had not yet been quantified, even&#13;
   so, it would appear unlikely that the outstanding balance will be collected at this stage. One of the three&#13;
   handpumps had broken down, so people were collecting water from the other two wells, the regular users of&#13;
   which were complaining that soon their handpumps would also breakdown as a result of over-use. No group of&#13;
   users paid a user fee, even though the handpumps had been installed for 8 months. It was the intention of the&#13;
   WMERD Zonal Department to establish a Community Water Committee and provide guidance on&#13;
   introduction of a user fee.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
As part of preparation for the proposed second phase of ESRDF, the whole mechanism and level of&#13;
community contribution is being reviewed. First, it would make sense if there were a mandatory cash&#13;
element: it is a need to promote the notion that access to improved water supply and sanitation will&#13;
&#13;
                                                        32&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           Rapid Assessment Of ESRDF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
always require cash payments for repairs or other services at some stage in the future. Second, the&#13;
standard requirement of Ã¢&#128;&#152;minimum 10 percentÃ¢&#128;&#153; community contribution should be reviewed Ã¢&#128;&#147; it is an&#13;
insignificant contribution for the low cost schemes and even for more costly schemes it may not be high&#13;
enough to really test the communitiesÃ¢&#128;&#153; demand. Some NGOs, and also in one of ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s sub-projects,&#13;
have achieved community contributions exceeding 30% of the sub -project costs. On the other hand, the&#13;
concept of Ã¢&#128;&#152;Basic Service LevelÃ¢&#128;&#153;, i.e. communities acting within their means, is also being promoted, to&#13;
the extent that ESRDF should not accept anything above an identified basic service level. If communities&#13;
choose a higher service level then they must cover all costs associated with that increment. The concept&#13;
of incremental improvements, linked to an expanded menu of eligible technologies, needs to be&#13;
promoted more, e.g. initial choice of several hand dug wells with a handpump, or even simple rope and&#13;
bucket, instead of a motorized scheme with piped distribution.&#13;
&#13;
4.3.2.   Technology choices and component selection&#13;
&#13;
The RWSS Technical Design Manual states the guiding principle in technology choice for a particular area&#13;
should be the least cost sustainable option to satisfy the design criteria within the given budget and with&#13;
affordable operation and maintenance costs, which the community is willing to pay. The following&#13;
selection criteria, in decreasing priority, was outlined in the Manual: (i) springs (either as point or gravity&#13;
supplies), (ii) hand dug wells installed with handpumps, and (iii) shallow drilled wells (up to 60 m deep)&#13;
installed with handpumps. If one technology alone could not meet the community demand then a m ix of&#13;
technologies (e.g. spring development and hand dug wells, or hand dug wells and shallow drilled wells) in&#13;
combination could be considered. In priority areas where these technologies, due to hydrogeological&#13;
conditions, were not feasible, then other technologies could be considered namely: (i) springs fitted with&#13;
motorized pumps, (ii) deep boreholes installed with a handpump if the static water level allowed, (iii) deep&#13;
boreholes installed with submersible pumps preferably powered by wind or solar energy, (iv) subsurface&#13;
dams, and (v) infiltration galleries. The practicality of community affordability and sustainability must&#13;
have been assured before implementation of these latter alternatives. Options requiring water treatment&#13;
were not considered. Rainwater catchment was to be promoted with particular emphasis on individual&#13;
households and institutional (schools, health centres, etc) establishments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Box 4.16: Technology Choice&#13;
&#13;
   At Zeguda Mariam in Amhara, the community had selected a spring protection development over an option to&#13;
   dig a hand dug well, as they didnÃ¢&#128;&#153;t feel that maintenance of a handpump was within their capacity. At Gula&#13;
   Giorgis hand dug well, the community was involved in locating the site, and chose a central location, and felt&#13;
   that the reliability of the source was worth the extra inputs, which they would have to contribute. At Abu Derta&#13;
   hand dug well, however, the community did not feel that the site for the well was ideal as it was far away from&#13;
   many of the users Ã¢&#128;&#147; they had raised these concerns before the project began, but were told that they had no&#13;
   alternative options. There was nothing on the project file to indicate that these concerns had been raised, or that&#13;
   any investigation of alternative sites had been carried out.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The Mid Term Review (June 1999) noted that there was a tendency to consider only the three types of&#13;
technologies specifically covered by the Operational Manual and also used for developing the SAR&#13;
estimates, namely point source spring protection development, hand dug well with handpump and&#13;
&#13;
                                                          33&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                     Rapid Assessment Of ESRDF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
shallow drilled well with hand pump / motorized borehole. It was clarified that this had never been the&#13;
intention, although it was expected that: (i) the majority of RWSS schemes would, for water resource and&#13;
community preference reasons, belong in one of those three categories and, (ii) where a choice between&#13;
these three categories was feasible, the cost sharing would provide communities with the incentive to&#13;
choose the low cost options.&#13;
&#13;
The menu of eligible technologies will be expanded/further promoted under a proposed ESRDF second&#13;
phase notably with the addition of rainwater harvesting (particularly in conjunction with large corrugated&#13;
sheet roofs and runoff harvesting technologies), solar and wind energy utilization, sub-surface dams and&#13;
even open improved hand dug well without hand pumps, as in many cases marginal improvements to&#13;
traditional sources can make a difference both to quantity and quality.&#13;
&#13;
The difference in cost per capita as a result of different selection strategies Ã¢&#128;&#147; often caused by not offering&#13;
choice between different options during promotion and project appraisal Ã¢&#128;&#147; is an issue that needs closer&#13;
scrutiny. Even where the local water resources do not offer feasible, low cost possibilities, it should not&#13;
be considered a straight forward decision to Ã¢&#128;&#152;over-investÃ¢&#128;&#153; in facilities for any given community. Informed&#13;
investment choice and better understanding of O&amp;M requirements need a better underpinning through&#13;
dialogue between facilitator (Implementing Agent) and communities. A general trend towards more&#13;
complex schemes with rising per capita costs is evident, and there is also huge disparity across the regions&#13;
in terms of technology choice, with consequent impact on cost per capita.&#13;

4.3.3.      Operation and maintenance&#13;
&#13;
The RWSS Handbook outlined the proposed responsibilities for operation and maintenance at (i)&#13;
community level, (ii) woreda level, and (iii) follow up and backstopping.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                          34&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                    Rapid Assessment Of ESRDF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Community level: Responsibility for O&amp;M at source and supply level lies with the WatSan committee, which&#13;
is to inform the community on rules and conditions governing the use of the water system, supervise&#13;
caretakers, collect and manage funds for maintenance and repair. The committee reports any problem&#13;
beyond its capacity to the Water Bureau. The caretakers, two at each water source, will show people how&#13;
to use the pump properly, carry out preventive maintenance, work with technicians and/or O&amp;M teams&#13;
from the Water Bureau for major repairs, organise community/users in cleaning around the source and&#13;
promote hygienic handling of water by users.&#13;
&#13;
Woreda level: The private sector will carry out repairs beyond the ca pacity of caretakers. The private sector&#13;
will manufacture pumps and spare parts as well as establish dealerships for supply of spares. Two options&#13;
for sale of spare parts are shop outlets and pump mechanics/technicians. Two self employed&#13;
mechanics/technicians will cover repairs at woreda level, with the repairs being paid for by the WatSan&#13;
committee through tariffs. At least one private spare part dealer will sell spares in a woreda.&#13;
&#13;
Follow up and backstopping will be provided by the Water and Health Bureaus, and the WatSan committees&#13;
at Woreda, Zonal and Regional levels. The Water Bureau staff will (i) carry out water quality monitoring&#13;
(ii) give advice when needed (iii) assure quality control on new and rehabilitated structures (iv) supervise&#13;
contractors (v) advise on tariffs/charges (vi) ensure quality control of repairs by pump&#13;
mechanics/technicians and (vii) community participation staff will carry out retraining of caretakers and&#13;
committees.&#13;
&#13;
In practice, for most schemes, technical support and backstopp ing is currently provided by the WMERD&#13;
Zonal Departments, though some regions have recently established a lower level through Woreda Water&#13;
Desks.&#13;
&#13;
A workshop on Management of Operation and Maintenance of Rural Water Supply Systems was held&#13;
between 1-3 April, 1999, in Bahir Dar, Amhara Region. While focusing on the specific issues and&#13;
solutions appropriate for Amhara, the high level participation by virtually all regions of Ethiopia made the&#13;
workshop a milestone in strategy development for sustainable RWS services. The three days were split&#13;
into input, analysis and output sessions with the intention of adopting the following key processes: (i)&#13;
gathering facts and opinions from the main actors on O&amp;M issues, (ii) share experiences from different&#13;
perspectives and places, (iii) discuss findings and recommendations of an O&amp;M study (undertaken as a&#13;
preparation for the workshop) an, (iv) formulate strategies and action plan for sustainable O&amp;M&#13;
management on rural water supply systems. Issues discussed during the group sessions were: (i) enabling&#13;
environment, (ii) technical issues and technology, (iii) capacity building, (iv) stakeholders and, (v) finance&#13;
and administration.&#13;
&#13;
The most recent inventory of completed ESRDF RWSS schemes was undertaken during late 2000/early&#13;
2001 in 6 out of the 10 regions. A total of 717 (44%) out of 1,642 schemes completed (October 2001)&#13;
were inventoried.&#13;
&#13;
Overall, 73%, 75% and 79% of spring protections, handpump and motorised schemes respectively were&#13;
functional, which compares favorably with a previous inventory (May 1999) covering only 65 completed&#13;
RWS schemes which showed that only 62% of schemes were functional. Functional was defined as&#13;

&#13;
In terms of community management, 90 percent of all schemes had a water committee and 85 percent&#13;
had a scheme caretaker. Rather disturbingly, however, only 28 percent paid a fee for O&amp;M, which raises&#13;
concern regarding the sustainability of these completed schemes, though it is also common for point&#13;
source caretakers/attendants to be paid in kind, and cash is only collected whenever required, e.g. to&#13;
purchase a spare part.&#13;
&#13;
The observations in the inventory report generally confirmed the findings of previous SPN missions that&#13;
the safeguarding of long term sustainability is not yet satisfactory. Appraisals/ pre-implementation studies&#13;
do not specify future O&amp;M requirements, and communities are rarely made aware of estimated future&#13;
water charges. Required management development for O&amp;M, including adequate training, is not well&#13;
synchronised with the physical implementation. There is also a need to use more appropriate handpump&#13;
types, e.g. Afridev.&#13;
&#13;
The following extracts from the Amhara Region Schemes Inventory Final Report (June 2001) provide&#13;
some qualitative information to complement the above figures.&#13;
&#13;
Box 4.18: Community Finance for O&amp;M&#13;
&#13;
Community finance to support O&amp;M is rather alarming, even in areas of relatively good annual harvest and not&#13;
just for communities living in drought prone areas. Only about one-quarter of the communities make use of water&#13;
through cash contribution or water vending. In most situations the cash contributions cover nothing more than&#13;
the salary of guards, who are hired by the community to watch the schemes. Only few schemes succeeded to&#13;
deposit excess money for maintenance. Reasons given by the communities are diverse, however, most gave the&#13;
reason that Ã¢&#128;&#156;we were not requestedÃ¢&#128;&#157; and assume the task to belong to the Government.&#13;

Box 4.19: Community Water Committees and Scheme Caretakers&#13;
&#13;
The great majority of Community Water Committees (CWCs) are not strong enough to administer the water&#13;
supply schemes. It may not be far from the truth to consider that most of the CWCs are nominal. In some cases&#13;
the CWC has no power or is not confident to mobilise the community. In most cases the CWCs lack self-initiation&#13;
and motivation and have the expectation that either the Go      vernment or NGOs will do the tasks. In all cases,&#13;
however, they lack awareness of their specific responsibilities. It seems that such tasks are not explicitly discussed&#13;
during the planning phase. Most schemes have caretakers, who are appointed from the CWC. The caretakers are&#13;
given a shallow training and for this reason most of them lack confidence to do their task. In sum, the training&#13;
offered to caretakers is not sufficient and they do not obtain periodic refreshment training courses.&#13;

&#13;
.Box 4.20: O&amp;M Planning, Tools and Equipment&#13;
The institutional arrangement at the regional and zonal levels is overshadowed by construction of new schemes.&#13;
O&amp;M is not an independent unit in the structure of the bureau and the zone, but is swallowed by the Department&#13;
of Rural and Urban Construction. This has in effect fragmented or loosened the information flow line between&#13;
the community, the Worerda Water Desk Officers (WWDOs), the zone and the bureau. There is no annual or&#13;
quarterly planning for O&amp;M as is the case for construction of new schemes. The challenge of O&amp;M is further&#13;
aggravated due to the lack of tools and equipment at all levels but more profoundly at the woreda and community&#13;
level, where easy access to spare parts is also a chronic problem. Neither a single of the WWDOs nor the&#13;
community caretakers possess in stock simple and easily wearable items such as seals or bolts. Each item has to be&#13;
fetched from the zone or bureau.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Most schemes do not have simple Ã¢&#128;&#152;user friendlyÃ¢&#128;&#153; O&amp;M plans suited to the use of local caretakers and&#13;
committee members for respective scheme typologies. For some schemes, even where a user fee is&#13;
collected, no spare parts are available to be purchased with the money raised, either from the organisation&#13;
which imported the handpump, the WMERD or the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
   Box 4.21: Access to Spare Parts&#13;
&#13;
   There are 270 handpumps registered with the WMERD Eastern Zonal Department in Tigray but the department&#13;
   has no handpump spare parts in stock and no system established for purchase of spare parts. Technicians are&#13;
   making replacement Ã¢&#128;&#152;OÃ¢&#128;&#153; rings for the Afridev footvalve from tyre inner tubes.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
A viable mechanism for spare parts supply remains an issue. The problem is related to the dispersed&#13;
installations and to the diversity of equipment caused either by donor/NGO preferences or by&#13;
government tendering procedures whereby standardization is discouraged. Where it is not viable for a&#13;
small scale trader to make a viable business, it also means that the cost of a government based supply&#13;
service will be high.&#13;
&#13;
   Box 4.22: Revolving Fund for Spare Parts&#13;
&#13;
   The WMERD in Tigray have a plan to establish Ã¢&#128;&#152;sh      opsÃ¢&#128;&#153; for spare parts through the zonal departments. The&#13;
   regional bureau would provide an initial stock of spares which would then be purchased by the small town water&#13;
   service offices. The zonal department would submit the money to the regional bureau on a quarterly basis which&#13;
   would in turn be used to purchase more spares. This revolving fund system has little coverage so far and is&#13;
   generally aimed at small town water supplies with motorised pump schemes.&#13;
&#13;
   Source: Lium et al. (1997)&#13;
&#13;
Some of the larger regions have appointed Woreda Water Desk Officers, who in future will keep spare&#13;
parts and charge community water committees for any spare parts and service provided in regard to&#13;
O&amp;M. One area currently being developed by ESRDF for possible implementation during a second&#13;
phase is capacity building of Woreda Water Desks in 55 selected woredas, by financing of spare parts&#13;
supply through a revolving fund. As part of ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s mandate and relatively large WSS portfolio, it&#13;
would be reasonable to spend a proportion of ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s WSS budget on s      trengthening the support&#13;
system that will be required to assist existing schemes from time to time and to be available to&#13;
communities that wish to develop a new scheme.&#13;
&#13;
There is an assumption that the private sector will follow once a market has developed, but this will&#13;
happen only if the business is viable.&#13;
&#13;
4.3.4.    Rural versus urban issues&#13;
&#13;
A full day meeting was held during the Mid Term Review (June 1999) to address certain key issues, one of&#13;
which was who should contribute and benefit from a particular RWSS scheme. The meeting defined a&#13;
Ã¢&#128;&#152;rural communityÃ¢&#128;&#153; as: a group of households that has a common interest in solving their water problem, by all being&#13;
prospective direct beneficiaries and being prepared to form a Ã¢&#128;&#152;water user associationÃ¢&#128;&#153; for demand articulation, representation&#13;
and management purposes. To demarcate rural as opposed to urban, the following broad definition was&#13;
adopted : a scheme which will have community based management and serving a settlement of less than 10,000 people,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                             38&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             Rapid Assessment Of ESRDF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
where the vast majority derive their income from peasant activities or from informal agricultural based market and trading&#13;
activities . The latter definition was aimed at setting an upper limit for eligible RWSS communities in the&#13;
continuum of settlement sizes and characteristics. Municipalities and zonal headquarters would be&#13;
excluded. The introduction of a ceiling of 10,000 population, however, may have precipitated the move&#13;
towards implementation of more complex schemes observed in ESRDF since 1999.&#13;
&#13;
Box 4.23: Private Sector Participation&#13;
&#13;
The problem with new schemes is that there will be relatively few break-downs, so that trained mechanics Ã¢&#128;&#147; if any&#13;
Ã¢&#128;&#147; will have insufficient work to sustain their livelihood. This is one of the reasons that training local mechanics or&#13;
pump attendants may not bring the effect that was expected. Especially at the early stages of rural water supply&#13;
programs, the coverage of the population with water supply facilities is relatively thin as well, resulting in little&#13;
work and long distances to be covered for maintenance and repairs. It may, therefore, be more efficient to train&#13;
locally available artisans, e.g. car mechanics, in repair and maintenance of water supply equipment, as they would&#13;
not have to depend on such activities only. Once the spread of water supply facilities increases, as well as the&#13;
number and age of the pumps and other components, a market for O&amp;M of water supply related equipment will&#13;
develop that will be attractive for the private sector as such. Initially, therefore, there appears to be a role for the&#13;
Government, and that is why its role should be extended to the Woreda level. Later, step by step, when the&#13;
[urban] systems go from partial to full cost recovery, also the role of the private sector can grow, and Government&#13;
spare parts shops could be privatized, introducing a certain degree of competition in this market.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
A workshop on Ã¢&#128;&#152;Sustainability in Rural Water SupplyÃ¢&#128;&#153; was held in July 2001 as part of the MOWR National&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation Master Plan Ã¢&#128;&#147; Environmental Support Project, Component 3, in which it&#13;
was stated that, Ã¢&#128;&#156;according to the generally used classification, any settlement larger than 2,000&#13;
inhabitants is classified as urbanÃ¢&#128;&#157;. In practice there is a difference between rural and urban water supply.&#13;
The larger towns clearly have (or qualify for) an urban water system, which Ã¢&#128;&#147; according to the current&#13;
guidelines Ã¢&#128;&#147; implies than water supply systems have to be built and operated on a full cost recovery basis&#13;
(investment costs as well as operation and maintenance costs). It seems reasonable to apply this criterion&#13;
to settlements with a population of more than 20,000 Ã¢&#128;&#147; 30,000. Settlements smaller than 2,000 should&#13;
clearly be considered rural, with a Ã¢&#128;&#152;grey areaÃ¢&#128;&#153; in between, where the actual local situation should determine&#13;
whether the settlement should be deemed urban or rural .&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Per capita consumption is defined as 20-30 litres per day, but his appears too high for point source supply&#13;
demand in rural areas, without substantial hygiene promotion activities. Typical actual consumption&#13;
figures for point sources are usually less than 10 litres per person per day.&#13;
&#13;
There are examples of both over- and under-design.&#13;

     The Bucha Raya spring development scheme (piped gravity from a spring) had been designed using typical urban&#13;
     design criteria with regard to design horizon, peak factors and consumption increase. The end result, even after&#13;
     ESRDF had reviewed and modified the design in some respects, seemed to be an over-design with un-utilized&#13;
     capacity for a long time to come.&#13;

     other aspects), it would have been clear that one well is insufficient. As the well runs dry early in the morning,&#13;
     many Ã¢&#128;&#152;beneficiariesÃ¢&#128;&#153; (i.e. households) have to use alternative unsafe sources. Inevitably, the erratic service will&#13;
     make cost recovery difficult Ã¢&#128;&#147; indeed those living farthest from the well are already withdraw ing Ã¢&#128;&#147; and the same&#13;

5.1.       Macro Overview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                        Key Findings                                                 Recommendations&#13;
5.1.1. The planned use allocation for water and                    Base future preparation/planning on the&#13;
sanitation during ESRDF was US$ 75 million, of which               implementation experience of ESRDF. [For the&#13;
only US$33 million had been budgeted for 2,322 sub-                proposed ESRDF second phase, a total number of 3,037&#13;
projects as of October 2001, benefiting nearly 2 million           RWSS sub -projects is proposed over a five year period,&#13;
people.                                                            which is realistic].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.1.2. The size of the RWSS component has proven too               (i) spend greater effort on promotion activities,&#13;
optimistic because: (i) promotion took longer to                   especially in the remoter areas, (ii) prioritize early&#13;
introduce, (ii) time required to build organization under          recruitment of Promotion and Training Officers and&#13;
new decentralization system, (iii) introduction of more            Community Facilitators, (iii) emphasize low-cost, simple&#13;
complex schemes for which implementation capacity                  to maintain technologies for direct community&#13;
could not be rapidly developed, (iv) need to spread sub-           participation, (iv) batch sub-projects, concentrating in a&#13;
projects to all parts of the regions each year for Ã¢&#128;&#152;equityÃ¢&#128;&#153;        few zones at a time, to rationalize the implementation&#13;
reasons based on political considerations, which resulted          process Ã¢&#128;&#147; the desired equity will still be achieved by the&#13;
in reduced economies of scale, and (v) initial reluctance          end of the total project period, (v) spend greater effort&#13;
on the part of NGOs to work with ESRDF.                            on involving NGOs as Implementing Agents.&#13;
5.1.3. The RWSS component has seen a substantial                   Emphasize low-cost, simple to maintain technologies for&#13;
budget allocation increase over the last 2-3 years, which          direct community participation.&#13;
reflects a trend of approving larger and more expensive&#13;
schemes Ã¢&#128;&#147; a move from hand dug wells and spring&#13;
development to shallow drilled wells, motorized&#13;

boreholes and distribution systems.&#13;
5.1.4. Based on preliminary and indicative estimates of              Na&#13;
allocations, ESRDF accounted for approximately 35&#13;
percent of all allocations to the WSS Sector for the&#13;
financial year 2001-02.&#13;
5.1.5. Conventional (supply) driven approaches are still             Prepare promotional material on DRA and collaborate&#13;
common among many of the partners who are available                  with water sector institutions to disseminate knowledge,&#13;
to assist the ESRDF -RWSS component.                                 especially among middle and lower level staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.1.6. Many of the WMERD technical studies                           Project preparation/detailed design must address: (i)&#13;
undertaken have concentrated only on design of civil                 water management organizational structure, (ii)&#13;
works and have not addressed O&amp;M requirements.                       tariff/user fee appropriate to the technology proposed&#13;
                                                                     and the estimated water demand, (iii) access to spare&#13;
                                                                     parts and technical support.&#13;
5.1.7. As a starting point for all ESRDF sub-project                 Reinforce informed investment choice and better&#13;
support, an expression of demand for improved services               understanding of operation and maintenance&#13;
and/or facilities should be received from a community,               requirements through closer dialogue bet ween facilitator&#13;
which is encouraged to make informed choices about                   (Implementing Agent) and communities.&#13;
service options and how those services are delivered.&#13;
Communities are then expected to contribute a&#13;
minimum of 10 percent toward the overall capital cost&#13;
of each scheme and ultimately own and bear&#13;
responsibility for O&amp;M.&#13;
5.1.8. The introduction of DRA was probably easier in                Continue promoting DRA to ensure the relevant&#13;
Ethiopia through the ESRDF than it may have been                     sections of the WRM Policy are adhered to, and that&#13;
through the regular sector institutions. This is                     ESRDF continues to lead the way in DRA, especially for&#13;
particularly true as the latter were undergoing                      poor and remote communities.&#13;
restructuring within the decentralization framework. It&#13;
became easier to have the DRA more accepted and later&#13;
incorporated into the new WRM Policy. Thus, possibly,&#13;
the ESRDF approach suggests a way of introducing&#13;
DRA when no prior experience exists for RWSS.&#13;

5.2.3. Information on the possibility and conditions for         Place greater emphasis on, and mobilize more resources&#13;
ESRDF support to RWSS schemes is the first                       for, promotion activities.&#13;
opportunity for ESRDF to make its message on&#13;
demand driven and community based development&#13;
known and understood. Unfortunately, it took quite&#13;
some time for the promotion messages to be&#13;
disseminated, particularly to remoter areas.&#13;
5.2.4. During the first couple of years, many projects           Encourage the assistance of NGOs, Regional/Zonal&#13;
were formulated at regional/zonal level by NGOs and              water bureaus, and particularly the new Woreda Water&#13;
government line bureaus; reflecting a more Ã¢&#128;&#152;supply               Desks and Woreda Water Committees (where&#13;
drivenÃ¢&#128;&#153; than truly Ã¢&#128;&#152;demand drivenÃ¢&#128;&#153; approach. Proposals           established) to assist communities in the identification&#13;
were simply drawn from the regular Ã¢&#128;&#152;project listsÃ¢&#128;&#153; in an         and preparation of project proposals.&#13;
attempt to jump  -start the RWSS component.&#13;
Increasingly, the approach applied is characterized by&#13;
NGOs and Regional/Zonal Water Bureaus assisting&#13;
communities in the identification and preparation of&#13;
project proposals.&#13;
5.2.5. The community role in sub -project initiation has         Liaise with the Consultant implementing the ESRDF&#13;
improved, yet there are problems with clarity on the             Impact Assessment Study (2002) and develop simple,&#13;
exact numbers of people to be served by each sub-                field-tested methods based on participation of&#13;

5.2.6. Field appraisals have confirmed that communities          Spend more effort on complete sub-project preparation,&#13;
are neither fully aware nor adequately informed of their         including aspects of O&amp;M, as inadequate preparation is&#13;
financial liabilities and responsibilities with regard to the    difficult to resolve through more rigorous appraisal.&#13;

5.2.7. A variety of Implementing Agents are being used,          Encourage greater involvement of NGOs as&#13;
from medium sized contractors via NGOs to                        Implementing Agents.&#13;
associations of artisans. The amount of departmental&#13;
implementation by Water Bureaus (force account or                Ensure level playing field for large-scale tenders (drilling&#13;
similar) was common during the early stages but has              and distribution schemes) to encourage greater&#13;

construction enterprises are now used to a varying&#13;
degree in the respective regions, ostensibly operating&#13;
independently and w ithout subsidies, but there may be&#13;
an element of preferential treatment and this will&#13;
inevitably discourage private contractors from investing&#13;
in capacity for WSS work.&#13;
5.2.8. The ESRDF monitoring and evaluation system is             Ensure greater data management discipline. Update the&#13;
closely linked to and ultimately dependent on a                  MIS and RWSS database especially with respect to&#13;

System (MIS), which utilizes a Ã¢&#128;&#152;tailor-madeÃ¢&#128;&#153; package and&#13;
cannot easily accommodate the level of detail required&#13;
for effective RWSS monitoring and evaluation, so the&#13;
RWSS CO has developed a parallel database in&#13;
Microsoft Access. There are differences between the&#13;
numbers presented in the MIS and the RWSS database.&#13;
5.2.9. Sub-projects are expected to be (i) demand                Compile comments of stakeholders and lessons learned&#13;

Policy Debates&#13;
5.3.1. In reconciling the short-term pressure to finish      Address the identified short-comings in the areas of&#13;
projects quickly and the long-term period needed to          project preparation/appraisal, and management&#13;
ensure ownership and sustainability, successive RWSS         development for operation and maintenance.&#13;
supervision missions have found that functionality and&#13;
utilization is adequate compared with the water sector&#13;
as a whole, though there is room for improvement, but&#13;
the safeguarding of long-term sustainability is not yet&#13;
satisfactory.&#13;
5.3.2. ESRDF has made a conscious effort to extend           Continue to actively engage in policy debates through&#13;
lessons learned to wider government operations for           sharing of lessons learned, performance reviews and&#13;
strategies to integrate DRA in sector institutions,          national level thematic workshops.&#13;

transparent procurement and disbursement procedures.&#13;
5.3.3. ESRDF is aligning itself with key decentralization    Continue to align ESRDF with decentralization policy&#13;
policy reforms through the pilot Woreda Development          reforms in order to maximize its impact on local&#13;
Fund, and a proposed continuation of the pilot during a      governance.&#13;
planned second phase in which ESRDF will finance&#13;

woredas, which are expected to follow bottom -up&#13;
mechanisms for identification, implementation and&#13;
monitoring, based on ESRDFÃ¢&#128;&#153;s experience.&#13;
5.3.4. The WRM Policy provides for grant support to          Consider an option that ESRDF could become the grant&#13;
RWSS, although with a part of the investment cost to         Ã¢&#128;&#152;windowÃ¢&#128;&#153; of the overall financing mechanism for RWSS&#13;

5.3.14. The most recent inventory of completed              Request and compile feedback on previously distributed&#13;
ESRDF RWSS schemes was undertaken during late               O&amp;M manuals, and review together with MOWR&#13;
2000 / early 2001 in 6 out of 10 regions. A total of 717    Demonstration Project material on O&amp;M.&#13;

5.3.16. To demarcate rural as opposed to urban, a           Consider settlements smaller than 2,000 to be rural, with&#13;
meeting held during the Mid-Term Review (1999)              a Ã¢&#128;&#152;grey areaÃ¢&#128;&#153; in between 2,000 Ã¢&#128;&#147; 10,000, where the actual&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in social funds
            : a rapid assessment of the Ethiopian social rehabilitation
            and development fund
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This rapid assessment of the water
            supply and sanitation component of the Ethiopian social
            rehabilitation and development fund is part of a wider study
            of water and sanitation in social funds in Sub-Saharan
            Africa, which is planned in three phases: (i) study of the
            water supply and sanitation (WSS) component of social funds
            in selected countries, (ii) regional workshop to develop an
            action plan for effective WSS component, and (iii)
            implementation of the action plan as appropriate. The main
            objectives of the first phase are to: (i) develop a macro
            understanding of the role of WSS in social funds, (ii) draw
            on the ground experience of WSS sub-projects in relation to
            design and sustainability issues, and (iii) develop lessons
            for WSS sub-projects in future social fund operations and
            for decentralized delivery of WSS services. During the first
            phase, rapid assessments were conducted of the water and
            sanitation components in the social funds of Ethiopia,
            Madagascar, Malawi and Mali.
