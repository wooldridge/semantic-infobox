THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;

the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 27,090&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 4&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 4*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the&#13;
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economyâ&#128;&#153;s name&#13;
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business&#13;

        warehouse on the land. The issuance date stated in the Land&#13;

&#13;
        To qualify for a building permit, BuildCo must purchase National&#13;
        Housing Bonds (NHBs) at any commercial bank. The NHB is&#13;
        calculated at a rate ranging from KRW 600.00 to KRW 1,300.00&#13;
        per sq. m., depending upon the structure of the warehouse. If the&#13;
        warehouse is constructed in steel frame, the rate of KRW&#13;

        BuildCo can either receive the money paid for the NHBs upon&#13;
        maturity or sell them at a discount (the discount is 10%). Upon&#13;
        purchase, the bank issues a receipt, which must then be&#13;
        presented to the Building Authorities. The cost is calculated as&#13;
        follows: KRW 1,300.00 x 1300.6 sq. m. = KRW 1,690,780.00.&#13;
        However, many sell the NHBs immediately at a discount of 10%,&#13;
        which brings the actual cost incurred by the company to KRW&#13;

      forwards the design drawings to the relevant regulatory agencies&#13;
      (such as the sewerage department and the fire department).&#13;
      Thus, it is not necessary for the company to obtain separate&#13;
      project clearances from these departments.&#13;
&#13;
      Under the Article 10 of the new Building Code, anyone who&#13;
      intends to construct a building may opt for a fast-track&#13;
      procedure and apply for an "advance decision regarding building&#13;
      permit" before applying for a building permit. If an advance&#13;
      decision is obtained for the construction, the builder must&#13;
      separately apply for and obtain a building permit for the&#13;
      construction. However, when the advance decision is obtained,&#13;
3     the relevant approval for the development or re-characterization        9 days     KRW 121,500&#13;
      of land (such approval is needed in certain zoning areas under&#13;
      several relevant laws) is deemed to be obtained. This effect of&#13;
      the advance decision is valid for 2 years from the date of&#13;
      issuance, before the builder applies for the building permit itself.&#13;
&#13;
      In addition, it is possible to submit simultaneous applications for&#13;
      an advance decision and for the traffic and environment impact&#13;
      assessment procedures, and the like, if those procedures are&#13;
      necessary. Accordingly, if the builder obtains an advance&#13;
      decision before applying for the building permit, the time before&#13;
      the construction may be reduced more or less. However, this has&#13;
      not worked well in practice and many companies follow the&#13;
      traditional way.&#13;
&#13;
      According to the Standard for Civil Petitions Treatment&#13;
      published by the Korean Government on December 30, 2005, the&#13;
      duration for obtaining a building permit for a two-story, 1,300-&#13;
      square-meter building is estimated to be 3 -- 14 days, subject to&#13;
      certain circumstances, including whether the work is performed&#13;
      by an agent (a certified architect). The duration can take a few&#13;
      days longer, as the case may be.&#13;
&#13;
      Before construction work begins, the company informs the&#13;
      authority thereof. BuildCo must present a notification&#13;
      application, including:&#13;

      inspector during construction, there is a penalty of up to 2 yearsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
      imprisonment or a fine of up to KRW 10 million. The inspector is&#13;
      independent of the company. The frequency of inspections&#13;
      varies depending on the size and cost of construction. Generally,&#13;
      an inspection takes place if the inspector and the company deem&#13;
      it necessary. However, in some instances, the contract between&#13;
      the company and the inspector contains a clause specifying the&#13;
      frequency of inspection. There must be at least two inspections        1 day     KRW 19,146,381&#13;

GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
Access to reliable and affordable electricity is vital for     WHAT THE GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
businesses. To counter weak electricity supply, many&#13;
firms in developing economies have to rely on self-            INDICATORS MEASURE&#13;
supply, often at a prohibitively high cost. Whether&#13;
electricity is reliably available or not, the first step for   Procedures to obtain an electricity connection&#13;
a customer is always to gain access by obtaining a             (number)&#13;
connection.&#13;
                                                                 Submitting all relevant documents and&#13;
What do the indicators cover?                                    obtaining all necessary clearances and permits&#13;

as well as the time and cost to complete them. These             Obtaining external installation works and&#13;
procedures include applications and contracts with               possibly purchasing material for these works&#13;
electricity utilities, clearances from other agencies            Concluding any necessary supply contract and&#13;
and the external and final connection works. In                  obtaining final supply&#13;

Reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index&#13;
&#13;
The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;
qualitative information on the mechanisms put in           duration and frequency of power outages in the largest&#13;
place by the utility for monitoring power outages          business city of each economy (for 11 economies the data&#13;
and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;
deterrent aimed at limiting outages (such as a             by a customer in a year. Annual data (covering the&#13;
requirement to compensate customers or pay fines           calendar year) are collected from distribution utility&#13;

The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values&#13;
indicating greater reliability of electricity supply and&#13;
greater transparency of tariffs.&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff&#13;
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.&#13;

      There is a system of reporting 'real transaction price' in Korea. The&#13;
      Parties that are going to enter into an agreement for sale of real&#13;
      property should report real transaction price to the Tax Department of&#13;
      jurisdictional district office (usually to Gu-Office, in case of there's no Gu:&#13;
      to City Hall, etc.) within 60 days after signing the sale agreement. This&#13;
      procedure is required to prevent tax evasion.&#13;

      Department issues "the real transaction price report".                            Less than a day&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;

            Doing business 2016 : measuring regulatory
            quality and efficiency - Korea, Republic of
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for Korea,
            Republic of. To allow for useful comparison, the profile
            also provides data for other selected economies (comparator
            economies) for each indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the
            13th edition in a series of annual reports measuring the
            regulations that enhance business activity and those that
            constrain it. Economies are ranked on their ease of doing
            business; for 2015 Korea, Republic of ranks 4. A high ease
            of doing business ranking means the regulatory environment
            is more conducive to the starting and operation of a local
            firm. Doing Business presents quantitative indicators on
            business regulations and the protection of property rights
            that can be compared across 189 economies from Afghanistan
            to Zimbabwe and over time. Doing Business sheds light on how
            easy or difficult it is for a local entrepreneur to open and
            run a small to medium-size business when complying with
            relevant regulations. It measures and tracks changes in
            regulations affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a
            business: starting a business, dealing with construction
            permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
            credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
            across borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency
            and labor market regulation. The data in this report are
            current as of June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes
            indicators, which cover the period from January to December 2014).
