STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. SOCIAL SECTOR BACKGROUND AND ISSUES&#13;
A. Economic Context&#13;
1.01   Over the past decade, Morocco has instituted reforms designed to achieve macroeconomic&#13;
stability and to liberalize the economy. Wide-reaching and comprehensive, the reforms have&#13;
gradually moved Morocco away from a predominantly state-administered economy towards one that&#13;
is more market-driven and outward-oriented. Yet, progress achieved on the macroeconomic front&#13;
remains fragile, as demonstrated by the continued indebtedness, and the deterioration in the fiscal&#13;
and external accounts which were exacerbated by the 1995 drought.&#13;
1.02   Morocco's growth rate, which averaged about 4% annually during the last decade, fell well&#13;
below expectations and was too low to absorb the country' s growing labor force.  Private&#13;
investment and domestic saving rates remain modest; labor productivity is not increasing; and&#13;
international competitiveness has recently eroded. The situation has been further exacerbated by the&#13;
recent drought, but prospects for 1996 are brighter.  Despite significant recent progress,&#13;
performance has also been disappointing in the social sectors. Morocco's indicators in health,&#13;
education, literacy, and access to safe water continue to lag behind those of economically&#13;
comparable countries.  A fifth of the population still lives in poverty or near-poverty, urban&#13;
unemployment rates have reached 20%, and rural women are still economically and socially&#13;
marginalized.&#13;
1.03   Morocco's low social performance and its relative economic success are intimately related.&#13;
For even with constructive political and economic reforms in place, the country cannot reach and&#13;
sustain higher economic growth rates without a substantial accumulation of human capital. To&#13;
achieve such a reserve, it must boost its investment in the provision of basic social services.&#13;
Conversely, without sustained economic growth, it will be extremely difficult to substantially&#13;
improve employment opportunities and living conditions of its population, which already stands at&#13;
26 million and is growing apace.&#13;
B. Poverty&#13;
1.04   Data gathered from  the 1985 Household Consumption Survey and the 1991 Living&#13;
Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) showed that the share of Morocco's population living&#13;
below the poverty line fell from 21 to 13% in those six years, while the GNP per capita rose by&#13;
about 30% (and presently hovers at around US$1, 100). This performance was achieved during the&#13;
period of structural adjustment. Adding the number of those whose expenditure levels are just&#13;
above the poverty line to the number of those who live below it, more than 3.3 million Moroccans&#13;
are still poor enough to be isolated from the mainstream economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.05   Urban, rural, and regional variations are also striking, and the gap dividing them  is&#13;
deepening. In 1991, 72% of all poor lived in rural areas as compared to 70% six years earlier.&#13;
Likewise, while a quarter of the population lived in poverty in the Center-North, East, and Center-&#13;
South regions, the poverty rate was below 5 % in coastal areas. In rural areas, the poor are typically&#13;
either seasonally underemployed wage-earners or small-scale farmers.  In urban areas they are&#13;
mostly self-employed people who work in the informal sector, underpaid (often temporary) wage-&#13;
earners, or are unemployed. If access to basic social services is taken into account, still more&#13;
differences between urban and rural areas come to light.&#13;
1.06   Along with low pay, unemployment and underemployment are major determinants of&#13;
poverty. In the early 1990s, the aggregate unemployment rate in urban areas was estimated at 16 to&#13;
20%, but among the urban poor the unemployment rate reached 30%. Unemployment rates are&#13;
much lower in rural areas, but these areas suffer substantial, chronic underemployment.  Not&#13;
surprisingly unemployment is most widespread among those with little or no education, but neither&#13;
are those with a secondary education immune. Unemployment rates are higher for women overall.&#13;
1.07   The growing importance of the informal sector --although a sign of the economy's&#13;
dynamism and ability to absorb excess labor supply and react to demand-- reflects an increase in the&#13;
reservoir of persons prone to fall below the poverty threshold.  The poverty assessment report&#13;
(World Bank 1994a) found a strong link between poverty in economic terms and such social ills as&#13;
low literacy, education, health, and nutrition levels and high fertility rates. That report, and other&#13;
studies, also found a strong correlation between income levels and degree of access to basic social&#13;
services. In light of these findings, the report strongly recommends the rehabilitation of basic social&#13;
services as a necessary prerequisite for the durable alleviation of poverty. Yet, until recently the&#13;
various social policies and programs were not strongly coordinated, and the link between this&#13;
disparate set of sectoral actions and the macroeconomic framework was loose.  There was,&#13;
moreover, no visible political will to address the problem of lagging social sector performance.&#13;
C. Education and Literacy&#13;
1.08   Since its independence in 1956, Morocco has accorded special priority to education with its&#13;
major policy thrusts to increase capacity at all levels, standardize and arabize the curriculum, and&#13;
moroccanize the teaching personnel.  Substantial progress has been made in all of these areas.&#13;
Enrollments have climbed steeply from the primary grades to university, and almost all of the&#13;
teaching personnel, even at the higher education level, are now Moroccan.&#13;
1.09   Yet despite this headway, Morocco's education system  is still plagued by major&#13;
deficiencies, which are almost certainly curtailing the country's prospects for long-term economic&#13;
growth.  The level of illiteracy remains high; for many citizens --especially girls-- primary&#13;
education (referred to as the "Enseignement Fondamental le, cycle" or "lower basic education") is&#13;
of low quality and insufficient coverage despite substantial educational reforms in the mid-1980s;&#13;
resources are allocated inefficiently, favoring secondary schools (corresponding to the "upper basic"&#13;
and the secondary education levels) to the detriment of primary education, and the urban elite to the&#13;
detriment of rural and disadvantaged groups (see Annex 1).&#13;
Low literacy level&#13;
1.10   Between the 1971 census and the 1991 household Living Standard Measurement Survey&#13;
(LSMS), the overall illiteracy rate in Morocco dropped from 75 to 55%.    This is substantial&#13;
progress, yet more than half of the population over the age of nine is still illiterate --double the rate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
characteristic of equivalent lower-middle-income countries. In addition, the pace of the progress&#13;
seems to have reached a plateau: according to the first results of the last census, the illiteracy rate&#13;
for the population aged 10 and over was still around 55% in 1994. Disparities among different&#13;
societal groups within Morocco are even more striking: 70% of women are illiterate as compared to&#13;
44% of men, and nearly 77% of the rural population is illiterate as compared to 38% of urban&#13;
dwellers. When both gender and locale are considered, the gap is still wider: 90% of rural women&#13;
are illiterate as compared to less than 26%  of urban men.  As in other countries, in Morocco&#13;
illiteracy is closely associated with such poverty indicators as high morbidity rates, poor nutrition,&#13;
and low income levels. But in Morocco, the urban-rural gap continues to widen with every&#13;
generation and the male-female gap has not narrowed appreciably since independence.&#13;
1.11   The Government has carried out several large-scale literacy campaigns over the last twenty&#13;
years. The most recent one, from 1990 to 1992, reached more than 600,000 people. Yet these&#13;
efforts were not well-targeted, and their impact has been small. The overall decrease in illiteracy in&#13;
Morocco is more a reflection of higher child enrollments than of adult literacy campaigns. Parental&#13;
illiteracy continues to hinder the education of children, particularly girls in the rural areas, whose&#13;
chances of learning to read and write have been shown to depend heavily on mothers' level of&#13;
education.&#13;
Lagging primary enrollments&#13;
1.12   In 1993-94, 4 million children were enrolled in the six grades of lower basic (ages seven to&#13;
twelve), upper basic (ages thirteen to fifteen) and secondary (ages sixteen to eighteen) education&#13;
system. Including children in modern preschools and Koranic schools, the overall enrollment was&#13;
just 41 %  from  ages four to twenty-three.  While that figure is lower than the 51 %  overall&#13;
enrollment rate averaged by the countries in the reference group, Morocco's 69% primary&#13;
enrollment rate lags even more shockingly behind the 87% averaged by the reference group.&#13;
1.13   For largely unknown reasons, primary enrollments in Morocco dropped sharply from 1982&#13;
to 1984, falling 30.5% in just two years, then returned to the previous levels and stagnated there&#13;
until 1989. Since the 1990 education campaigns undertaken by the Government, primary enrollment&#13;
rates have risen rapidly. In 1993 new admissions were 24% higher than those in 1982, and from&#13;
1980 to 1993, enrollment also increased 3.7% in upper basic grades and 4% in secondary schools.&#13;
1.14   Yet, the net enrollment rate of rural children in primary education is still well below that of&#13;
their urban counterparts (58% versus 82% in 1994 ), and the educational prospects of Morocco's&#13;
rural girls is even dimmer, with a net primary enrollment rate of 34% (vs. 85% for urban boys).&#13;
Female enrollments are far more sensitive than male enrollments to both school-related and&#13;
nonschool-related variables (such as family size and composition, domestic chores, and economic&#13;
status). These demand-side factors must therefore be dealt with if Morocco is to improve its rural&#13;
girls' prospects for getting an education.&#13;
1.15   Recent studies following quite different approaches and data sources have uncovered a&#13;
number of critical determinants of girl's school participation (MEN 1993, World Bank 1995a,&#13;
World Bank 1994b and World Bank 1993). It is well-known that girls' schooling generates greater&#13;
opportunity costs than boys' and that their enrollment and retention at school is related to the&#13;
existence of such school amenities as latrines, drinkable water, and canteens. Canteens in Morocco&#13;
are particularly associated with significantly higher school attendance, and in 1993-94,&#13;
960,000 children benefited from the national School Canteen Program, 88% of which was financed&#13;
by the World Food Program and the rest by the Ministere de I'Education Nationale (Ministry of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
National Education, MEN). Urgent food needs in other countries, however, have obliged the&#13;
World Food Program to taper off its aid to Morocco, which will continue to receive assistance on a&#13;
declining basis for the next two or three years contingent upon the submission of a substitution plan.&#13;
1.16   Koranic preschools have great potential for raising primary enrollment rates overall. Pilot&#13;
projects aimed at promoting Koranic preschools, implemented by the MEN with financial support&#13;
from the UNICEF and specialized NGOs, have yielded encouraging results--particularly in terms of&#13;
modernizing this traditional institution and improving outcomes. While the tradition of Koranic&#13;
preschools is not as well-implanted in rural as in urban areas, they are still better accepted by some&#13;
parents than are modern schools and therefore represent a potential vehicle for promoting schooling&#13;
and improving achievement in basic education.&#13;
Low guality and internal efficiency&#13;
1.17   Reliable data regarding schools' achievements are not yet available, although various&#13;
evaluations are under way. Assessments of learning achievement that have been realized suggest&#13;
that there has been a decline in learning performance in basic subjects overall and weak achievement&#13;
in higher-order skills, with tremendous disparities between urban and rural areas. The low quality&#13;
of instructional materials in most schools reflects the high level of expenditure on personnel (97% of&#13;
the basic education operating budget), which drains funding from all other inputs. A recent survey&#13;
of rural schools showed that in the poorest provinces, only half the teachers had the required&#13;
teachers' guides. Math tests show that urban children outperform their rural counterparts, that&#13;
completion rates are lower for rural children than for urban ones, and that under-investment in&#13;
education is more pronounced in rural than in urban areas. They also suggest that boys do better&#13;
than girls, but that additional schooling can significantly improve girls' performances (World&#13;
Bank 1994b).&#13;
1.18   Although schools' internal efficiency has improved as a result of the mid-1980s education&#13;
reforms, dropout rates are still an area of concern. In the past, MEN used a system of nucleus (six-&#13;
grade) and satellite (two- or four-grade) schools. When a rural student reached the last grade of a&#13;
satellite school, he or she was usually obliged to walk to a more remote nucleus school serving&#13;
several satellites. Many girls, especially, failed to make the transition, which proved to be a strong&#13;
incentive for dropping out.&#13;
Inefficient resource use&#13;
1.19   Most education funding comes from the State (84% of the total). The rest is provided by&#13;
families (11 %), local governments (3%) and business (2%).  In 1992 the central Government&#13;
allocated 28 % of its budget to the Ministry of National Education and 35 % to education and training&#13;
in general, amounting to 7.3% of GDP. But although these percentages are markedly higher than&#13;
the 17 % for education (equal to 6.6% of GDP), averaged by the reference group, indicators suggest&#13;
that Morocco's education system gets worse results, especially with regard to literacy and basic&#13;
education. In addition, only expenditures for basic education represent a social transfer to the poor,&#13;
who out-number the middle class and wealthy at that level but are under-represented in the upper&#13;
educational grades. Combined with the steep increase in unit costs (US$200 at the lower basic&#13;
level, US$490 at the upper level, and US$820 at the secondary level in 1992), skewing support&#13;
toward the upper levels has the effect of a large-scale transfer of public funding to the least needy&#13;
(World Bank 1994c).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
1.20   A break-down of operational expenditures by level of education shows that lower basic&#13;
education's relative share is low (35% as against 43% in the reference group) while that for upper&#13;
basic grades and secondary education is high (46% as against 23%). Expenditures on higher&#13;
education are slightly below the reference group average. A functional analysis of public spending&#13;
for education, moreover, reveals the burden placed by the teaching and nonteaching staff wage bill,&#13;
which makes up 97 % of the total operating budget for lower basic education and 95 % of the budget&#13;
for upper-basic and secondary schooling (World Bank 1994d).&#13;
1.21   Morocco's excessive teaching staff wage bill derives more from an unrealistic staffmg&#13;
policy, than from generous compensation practices--although primary school teachers' salaries were&#13;
a multiple of 4.8 per capita GDP in 1992, as compared to a multiple of 2.5 for Asian countries. In&#13;
1993-94 the student:teacher ratio was as low as 28:1 for lower basic, 18:1 for upper basic, and 13: 1&#13;
for secondary schools, having steadily declined from 1980-81 to 1990-91. The ranks of certain&#13;
categories of nonteaching personnel have also become swollen, so that the lower basic education&#13;
student:support-staff ratio fell from some 290:1 in 1989-90 to 180:1 in 1993-94. At the upper-basic&#13;
level, 13% of teachers (some nine people per school) and at the secondary level, 15% of teachers&#13;
(eleven people per school) are assigned to administrative or financial duties. The reasons for this&#13;
evolution have been clearly identified by the MEN and include the low demographic density in rural&#13;
areas, the artificial creation of jobs in schools during the 1980s to mitigate the impact of&#13;
unemployment among university graduates, the fact that teacher training- school graduates far&#13;
outnumber the actual demand for teachers, and the lack of transparency in personnel assignment and&#13;
management. At the same time, the staffing of rural schools remains problematic, particularly in&#13;
small villages where housing is difficult to find. Long commuting time for teachers results in&#13;
absenteeism, loss of efficiency, and high turnover.&#13;
II. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY AND BANK RESPONSE&#13;
A. Government Strategy&#13;
2.01   For a long time in Morocco, spending to promote human capital was not considered an&#13;
investment that would ultimately lead to greater and more sustainable economic growth, and instead,&#13;
economic growth was perceived as the only engine of social progress. Therefore, social concerns&#13;
were not a top Government priority and, despite indisputable sectoral improvement during the 1980s&#13;
and 1990s, there was no comprehensive, long-term plan for the social welfare of the country.&#13;
2.02   But following an era of thorough macroeconomic adjustment and worrisome decline in&#13;
social conditions throughout the Kingdom, the Government has started to focus on social issues in a&#13;
more concerted manner.  In 1993 it issued the Social Development Strategy (Strategie de&#13;
Developpement Social pour la Decennie 1990, SDS), which sets forth clear directives aimed at&#13;
reversing past trends and establishing the framework for a sound social policy. Based on the 1991&#13;
Living Standards Measurement Survey, the Government strategy made extending basic social&#13;
services to the poor and increasing their participation in economically productive activities its&#13;
highest social goals. Such extended coverage would include access to safe water, sewage facilities,&#13;
health care, family planning services, nutrition, primary education, literacy programs, and&#13;
subsidized public housing. But recognizing prevailing budgetary constraints, the strategy stresses&#13;
the inter- and intra-reallocation of resources and introduction of cost-recovery mechanisms. It also&#13;
advocates action to promote employment and bolster social protection. Finally, the SDS emphasizes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
that a strong and appropriate administrative vehicle and reliable statistical monitoring system are&#13;
required for the implementation of its recommendations.&#13;
2.03   The Government gave the first version of the Strategie de Developpement Social pour la&#13;
Decennie 1990 to the Bank in the context of the second adjustment program. Following the&#13;
appraisal of the Social Priorities Program, the strategy was updated, formally re-endorsed by the&#13;
new Government, and officially conveyed to the Bank [para. 6.01a]. Its internalization throughout&#13;
the relevant agencies is now underway. Specific sectoral action plans are being developed for the&#13;
education and health sectors as part of the preparation of the Social Priorities Program.  The&#13;
creation of the Ministry of Population, which has the responsibilities of a ministry of planning, and&#13;
should be able to coordinate actions throughout the social sectors within a unifying framework, is&#13;
another signal that the Government is taking social concerns seriously and is adapting its institutions&#13;
accordingly. Finally, the King's recent request to the Bank to frame a long-term vision statement&#13;
for the education sector, his October 1995 address to the Parliament of Morocco following reception&#13;
of the Bank's statement (World Bank 1995b), and his decision to disseminate it widely, all point to&#13;
the fact that concerns for education now emanate from the highest levels of the power hierarchy.&#13;
Recent initiatives taken and/or being prepared by the two ministers in charge of education to&#13;
rationalize their respective subsectors are encouraging too.&#13;
2.04   The Government is particularly concerned that even high levels of public spending have&#13;
done little to close the education gap separating Morocco from the reference group of countries.&#13;
Since 1991, therefore, the Government has conducted several studies, collecting the data needed to&#13;
formulate a catch-up strategy for targeting female enrollment in order to boost the admission rate&#13;
from its present 34% in rural areas to 55% by 2000-01. The approach rests on three pillars:&#13;
(a)    Targeting resources. The problem of rural school enrollments must be addressed within&#13;
the context of a broader strategy for wiping out poverty and increasing economic and social&#13;
development in rural areas.  The Government is therefore starting to target the most&#13;
disadvantaged groups and geographical regions for the provision of basic social services.&#13;
(b)   Improving efficiency and quality. The strategy for adapting the education system to the&#13;
needs of sparsely populated rural areas is to bring schools closer to the students, to&#13;
reorganize schools wherever possible on the model of a multigrade system, to make&#13;
available the most effective school inputs, and to offer more programs covering the full six&#13;
primary grades.&#13;
(c)    Addressing nonschool factors. The strategy to rectify nonschool factors that undermine&#13;
demand for schooling is to improve the effectiveness of literacy programs, step up&#13;
information and awareness-raising campaigns for parents, and re-focus the public works&#13;
program to create supplementary income in targeted regions.&#13;
2.05   The MEN has developed a Plan d'Action Sectoriel (PAS, Sector Action Program)--an&#13;
operational program for basic and secondary education from 1995 to 2000 that seeks to correct&#13;
distortions in the allocation and management of education resources. Under this plan, Morocco has&#13;
already decentralized school construction to local communities. It now hopes to generate savings by&#13;
improving efficiency, by balancing the resources allocated to basic and secondary education to&#13;
reflect more accurately the nation's education priorities. What options would be offered to students&#13;
once they reached the end of basic education remains to be defined, for access to the public system&#13;
would necessarily remain restricted. Policy discussions under way in the Moroccan Parliament have&#13;
touched on the possibility of encouraging the development of private post-basic education (which, at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
present, accounts for barely 8% of the total) and of introducing cost-recovery measures into the&#13;
public system from secondary school on. In March 1995 the Ministry of National Education was&#13;
split into two in an effort to rationalize the sector's administrative structure. Higher education is&#13;
now under the responsibility of a separate ministry, while responsibility for primary and secondary&#13;
education remains with the MEN.&#13;
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.06   The severe state of degradation of Morocco's social sectors underscores the urgent need for&#13;
intensive, durable action. Bank support for such action is called for both by the present climate of&#13;
support in the Government and by the Bank's own Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), currently&#13;
under preparation, which puts investing in people as its first priority. Bank support for the social&#13;
sector would also accord with its parallel efforts to strengthen macroeconomic performance and&#13;
encourage growth through private investment. Other donors have viewed the goals of the Strategie&#13;
de Developpement Social pour la Decennie 1990 (based on the Living Standards Measurement&#13;
Survey and confirmed by the World Bank poverty assessment) as a rallying point, and support for&#13;
SDS policies is fully in line with the Bank's strategy of poverty alleviation and Morocco's overall&#13;
plan to develop its human resources. Since the Bank has already financed several projects in&#13;
Morocco's social sectors--especially in health and education--the proposed project would be an&#13;
extension of earlier Bank involvement. The Country Economic Memorandum (World Bank 1995c)&#13;
provides a solid body of evidence that programs whose aim is to improve Morocco's human capital&#13;
base and to increase labor efficiency and productivity warrant reinforcement of present Bank&#13;
support. Finally, a recent study of the region's present situation and long-term prospects (World&#13;
Bank 1995d) shows that Morocco, along with its neighbors, is experiencing high unemployment and&#13;
now feels an especially urgent need for bold programs aiming for both economic growth and&#13;
poverty alleviation. The Bank's role in promoting the Government's social strategy and marshaling&#13;
international and bilateral support for social programs will be critical if Morocco is to succeed in the&#13;
fight it is waging against poverty, both in terms of equity and of economic growth.&#13;
2.07   The Ministry of Education's Sector Action Plan, which needs to be adjusted in light of the&#13;
1996-2000 Economic and Social Development Plan, addresses all of the important issues facing the&#13;
education sector (including access, retention, equity, quality, efficiency, and financing). The plan&#13;
takes into account the conclusions of various recent studies, the Bank's general views on the sector,&#13;
and the vision statement on education the World Bank recently addressed to the King (World Bank&#13;
1995b). In line with the SDS, it advocates using an integrated package of interventions to reach&#13;
target areas and populations. By opening up basic education facilities, making school attendance&#13;
less expensive and easier for poor families, and linking literacy programs to productive employment&#13;
promotion activities, the proposed project would contribute greatly to the overall alleviation of&#13;
poverty, a primary Bank goal. The determination of the Government to act on rectifying both the&#13;
school and nonschool factors that are presently undermining the demand for primary education in&#13;
rural areas and its resolve to systematize cost-effective approaches to increase enrollments in these&#13;
areas, deserve clear encouragement from the Bank, which has been recommending such measures&#13;
for a long time.&#13;
C. Bank Experience and Lessons Learned&#13;
2.08   In the past, the Bank has supported several operations in Morocco's social sectors, and&#13;
three such projects are currently being implemented (two in education and one in health: the Health&#13;
Sector Investment Project, Loan 3171-MOR). The main general lessons to be drawn from these&#13;
operations are as follows: (a) Reforms in the social sectors should not be overly ambitious because&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
of their immense impact on large groups and the political risks attached to them. (b) A good&#13;
management information system and simple and transparent management, procurement, and&#13;
disbursement procedures must be in place for all Bank-financed activities. Such measures are also&#13;
meant to offset cumbersome local financing circuits, which tend to delay execution and slow down&#13;
disbursements, especially for decentralized project activities. A study is currently being conducted&#13;
by the Government to identify precisely the bottlenecks and the sources of delays. (c) To ensure&#13;
full acceptance of the project, it is critical to seek the early involvement of all constituents--in&#13;
particular, employees of line ministries at the provincial and local level who will play a crucial role&#13;
during project implementation. It is equally important to involve other Government constituencies&#13;
(such as the Ministry of Finance) and other donors early enough in the process to guarantee&#13;
successful future collaboration. (d) Finally, realistic budgetary envelopes have to be projected (and&#13;
committed) to ensure the sustainability of sectoral programs and actions.&#13;
Lessons learned in the education sector&#13;
2.09   Since 1963, the Bank has financed eight projects (two credits and six loans) in the education&#13;
sector, including a sector adjustment project, the Education Sector Reform Program (Loan&#13;
2664-MOR, US$150 million, 1986-88), and two projects currently being implemented: the Rural&#13;
Primary Education Project (Loan 3026-MOR, US$83 million, 1989-96) and the Rural Basic&#13;
Education Development Project (Loan 3295-MOR, US$145 million, 1991-97). The PPAR (Report&#13;
No. 12558) for the sector adjustment project identifies "insufficient understanding of the&#13;
determinants of demand for education in rural areas" as a major source of failure of operations in&#13;
the education sector. The ongoing projects confirm that if demand factors are not addressed, it is&#13;
unlikely that school attendance in rural areas will substantially increase. They also demonstrate that&#13;
project execution can be substantially improved if (i) project implementation units are well staffed&#13;
and well integrated in the national administrative structure, (ii) accountability of the various actors --&#13;
Education, Finances and Interior-- is better defined and the responsibility of operations is left to the&#13;
MEN, and (iii) the MEN sub-contracts the management of technical assistance to institutions --such&#13;
as UN agencies--. Finally, these projects, together with former operations, show that (i) the&#13;
problems faced at each level of education are complex and specific to each sub-sector, and should&#13;
not be lumped together in a single project, and (ii) reforms aiming to introduce more efficiency and&#13;
to alter the pattern of resource allocation in the education sector require time. Further to such a&#13;
long exposure to Bank procedures, seasoned implementation teams are in place within the MEN.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. The Social Priorities Program&#13;
3.01   The proposed project is part of the Social Priorities Program  I (SPP I; Barnamaj al-&#13;
Aoualaouiyat al-Ijtimaiya, or BAJ I, in Arabic; Programmne Priorites Sociales I, or PPS I, in&#13;
French), initiated to assist the Government in the implementation of its strategy to increase the&#13;
poor's access to basic social services, enhance basic social protection, and create new opportunities&#13;
for the under- and unemployed to participate in economically productive activities. The program&#13;
would also bolster Government awareness of poverty-related and social issues and catalyze efforts to&#13;
rehabilitate Morocco's social sectors. While the SPP would entail a series of consecutive programs&#13;
following one another at a rapid pace, SPP/BAJ I was conceived as a set of three complementary --&#13;
but independent-- projects to be implemented simultaneously (Annex 2). All three share the same&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
broad objectives, were developed within the same framework, and would be implemented&#13;
independently within the same geographical area.&#13;
3.02   By using a multisectoral approach-- which is expected to yield more significant and durable&#13;
results than serial, strictly sectoral projects-- this tripartite program would help to guarantee&#13;
flexibility in execution and should therefore be a more efficient way to channel energies and&#13;
resources. The SPP/BAJ would target rural areas in Morocco's thirteen poorest and least urbanized&#13;
provinces, where 27% of the total population, or 7.1 million people, currently live (provinces and&#13;
selection criteria are listed in Annex 3). By involving provincial authorities in project monitoring,&#13;
moreover, the SPP/BAJ should achieve the integration needed to reinforce its impact.  The&#13;
objectives of the three projects would be: (a) to increase the quality and quantity of basic education&#13;
while at the same time making the education system more efficient and equitable; (b) to improve&#13;
access to basic health services and improve their quality while bolstering performance and&#13;
managerial capacities within the health care system; (c) to enhance basic rural infrastructure through&#13;
labor-intensive techniques; and (d) to establish a permanent apparatus for data collection and&#13;
analysis that would strengthen the government's ability to galvanize support for SDS activities and&#13;
monitor their impact.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
3.03   The proposed education project would strengthen human capital by making education and&#13;
literacy available to populations that have hitherto been deprived of them. In particular, it would&#13;
build on earlier Bank assistance extended for the purpose of increasing access to and improving the&#13;
quality of primary education. The objective of this project is to contribute to the Government's&#13;
efforts to boost its educational system in both qualitative and quantitative terms and to make its&#13;
performance correspond more closely to that in economically comparable countries.&#13;
3.04   Unlike earlier projects, however, this project would (a) target the poorest population in the&#13;
country; (b) aim to have an impact on both the supply of and demand for education; and (c) affect&#13;
institutions both upstream (Koranic preschools) and downstream (literacy education for adults) of&#13;
the formal education system. The proposed project would be concentrated in specific communities&#13;
located in the thirteen selected provinces. These 'priority intervention areas" (Zones d'Intervention&#13;
Prioritaire, ZIP) have been selected on the basis of a group of indicators showing low overall&#13;
demand and low female enrollment rates (Annex 4). Several donors have expressed an interest in&#13;
supporting the Government's educational strategy.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
3.05   The proposed project would be implemented over a five-year period plus one year to&#13;
complete disbursemnets, at a total cost of US$97.7 million equivalent and would consist of five&#13;
components:&#13;
(a)    Improving access to and retention rates in remote rural areas by expanding the supply of&#13;
available basic schooling.&#13;
(b)    Reducing the gap between the school participation rates of boys and girls.&#13;
(c)    Improving education quality.&#13;
(d)    Improving the performance of Government literacy programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
(e)    Providing technical support to the MEN to operationalize and implement its Sector Action&#13;
Plan, which aims to reallocate resources to priority programs and improve budgetary&#13;
efficiency.&#13;
Improving access to and retention in basic education&#13;
3.06    The first project component (US$52.8 million) would expand the supply of basic education&#13;
by improving school accessibility and coverage. To improve accessibility, the MEN would establish&#13;
schools in every rural community that had more than 200 inhabitants and was not already served by&#13;
a school "reasonably close by." Because of the variety of climates, terrain and populations that&#13;
characterize the thirteen selected provinces, the decision about which schools were "reasonably&#13;
close" would be entrusted to the provincial planning units. To the extent possible, the MEN would&#13;
make the newly built schools multigrade so that schools close to rural communities would offer the&#13;
full basic education course.&#13;
3.07   The component designed to increase access and retention rates would include:&#13;
(a)    Building and equipping about 360 multigrade schools with a maximum of two classrooms in&#13;
communities with over 200 inhabitants that do not already have a full primary school&#13;
nearby.&#13;
(b)    Completing the infrastructure by building additional class-rooms for approximately 650&#13;
satellite schools, so that they can offer full primary education and multigrade courses.&#13;
(c)    Developing a new  methodology and teaching materials for multigrade teaching and&#13;
organizing preservice and inservice training for about 5,000 teachers assigned to multigrade&#13;
classes and for all new teachers. The French Government has already decided to increase&#13;
the number of its technical assistants to foster multigrade teaching in the target provinces,&#13;
and is expected to fund the development part of this element [para. 6.03b(i)]. Proof of this&#13;
parallel financing was given at negotiations.&#13;
(d)    Supporting the Government effort to strengthen the School Canteen Program to the targeted&#13;
areas by equipping new canteens and helping the Government to meet the canteen&#13;
program's operating costs during the period of disengagement of the World Food Program&#13;
(WFP) and possibly to the end of the project. Support would include food requirements&#13;
for a limited number of pupils in the provinces from where the WFP will be withdrawing.&#13;
Priority would be given to schools in communities with the lowest female enrollment rates.&#13;
A plan committing the Government to fund the School Canteen Program fully would be&#13;
discussed during the mid-term evaluation review (to be held before June 30, 1999) and&#13;
would be a condition for the continuation of Bank support for the Canteen Program to the&#13;
end of the project [para. 6.03d(i)].&#13;
(e)   Improving facilities for approximately 100 preschools by distributing modest furnishings&#13;
and teaching materials to selected Koranic pre-schools and setting up a program for initial&#13;
and continuing pedagogical and professional training for Koranic school teachers.&#13;
(f)    Carrying out a series of studies and small scale experiments of techniques for imparting&#13;
basic skills to children aged ten to sixteen who never attended primary school.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
Reducing the gender gap&#13;
3.08   By addressing the various demand factors presently affecting girls' enrollments, the second&#13;
project component (US$17.4 million) would reinforce the effects of the first one. All elements&#13;
contributing to increased access and lower dropout rates would also promote greater female&#13;
participation and would therefore help to reduce the education gap between boys and girls. This&#13;
component, however, would specifically target girls by reducing the cost of education to families,&#13;
upgrading schools, ensuring that whenever possible newly-built schools had access to drinkable&#13;
water and latrines, and fostering community involvement in operating schools. The component&#13;
would include the following elements:&#13;
(a)    Distributing textbooks and school supplies free of charge to underprivileged children, with&#13;
priority given to girls.&#13;
(b)    Installing about 300 latrines and 150 wells in schools characterized by low  female&#13;
enrollments.&#13;
(c)    Rehabilitation of school facilities aiming at increasing girls' attendance.&#13;
(d)    Organizing two awareness campaigns for each targeted community over the project period&#13;
to promote schooling for girls in rural areas. The campaigns would target families and&#13;
would be organized with the help of local elected officials and central administration&#13;
representatives.&#13;
Improving education qcuality&#13;
3.09   The project's third component (US$21.6 million) would provide a standard set of&#13;
instructional materials to each school, test and organize remedial courses for underachievers, set up&#13;
an "innovation fund" to promote school-based projects, and provide housing for teachers in remote&#13;
areas (which would complement efforts to devise an improved methodology for multigrade&#13;
teaching). The component would include the following:&#13;
(a)    Providing furnishings and a minimum  set of instructional materials to all schools that&#13;
presently lack them.&#13;
(b)    Distributing Teachers' Guides to all teachers assigned to rural schools.&#13;
(c)    Making shared pedagogical resources available to students and teachers (mobile libraries).&#13;
(d)    Testing and organizing remedial courses for underachieving pupils.&#13;
(e)    Equipping school inspectorates with vehicles suitable for the terrain, so that they can visit&#13;
more schools in their catchment area more often.&#13;
(f)    Organizing short management training courses for school directors to help them run their&#13;
schools more effectively.&#13;
(g)    Promoting innovation at the school level. Using agreed guidelines and criteria for project&#13;
identification, presentation and selection, a provincial board would choose a small number&#13;
of projects whose aim is to raise the quality of education, strengthen professional relations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
among school teachers, promote school life, and integrate it into the community. Schools&#13;
would be grouped in categories according to indicators of quality, and projects from the&#13;
more deprived schools would be selected.  Final agreement on funding mechanisms&#13;
(selection criteria, financial responsibilities, etc.) was reached during  negotiations&#13;
[para. 6.03a(i)]. Each year a competition would be organized to grant prizes to the most&#13;
successful projects.&#13;
(h)    Building about 180 houses to board teachers in remote areas, to increase the likelihood that&#13;
they would stay in the schools they are assigned to.&#13;
Literacy programs&#13;
3.10   The proposed project's fourth component (US$3.7 million) would be based on the&#13;
observation that parents with higher levels of literacy are more willing to send their children to&#13;
school. Mothers' level of literacy, in fact, is one of the factors most strongly associated with girls'&#13;
access to primary education. In order to put into practice the lessons learned from earlier literacy&#13;
campaigns, the Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs (MEAS) designed a pilot program to test&#13;
a new type of literacy campaign, which would strengthen people's motivation to become literate by&#13;
seeking a field of application for the newly acquired knowledge from the outset. Given the novelty&#13;
of this approach and the emphasis on quality, the pilot campaign would be limited to 2,500 people a&#13;
year --half of them women-- in the six provinces chosen for targeting under the pilot project. The&#13;
component would include the following:&#13;
(a)    Providing technical assistance for the development of strategies to follow up on gains made&#13;
during literacy campaigns. One of the pilot activities in this area would be to link literacy&#13;
programs to the public works activities supported by the third SPP/BAJ project&#13;
(Employment Promotion and Poverty Monitoring) and implemented by the Promotion&#13;
Nationale, a labor intensive public works agency.&#13;
(b)   Designing appropriate training support (including materials relevant to women), and&#13;
retraining instructors.&#13;
Capacity building&#13;
3.11   The fifth project component (US$1.6 million) would provide the technical assistance,&#13;
training, and equipment necessary for the MEN to implement, monitor, and adjust its Sectoral&#13;
Action Plan (PAS). Under this plan, the Government would shift budgetary resources to basic&#13;
education to promote wider coverage and better quality, particularly in rural areas, and would&#13;
preserve a core program of expenditures for basic education (Annex 4, table 3). The plan would&#13;
also address the problem of inefficiencies in resource allocation and use, especially with regard to&#13;
secondary staff appointments. The content of the PAS has already been discussed and deemed&#13;
satisfactory by the Bank. It was transmitted officially to the Bank before negotiations [para. 6.02a].&#13;
3.12   The most important elements of the capacity building component are the following:&#13;
(a)    Development of a public expenditure program for the primary and secondary education&#13;
sectors in agreement with the Ministries of Finance and Population, and training personnel&#13;
in the MEN's Directorate of Statistics, Forecasting, and Planning (DSPP) in techniques&#13;
related to such a program's development. The program would single out core (wage and&#13;
non-wage) expenditures for primary education. It would be prepared and updated each year&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
and transmitted to the Bank for discussion by July 31 of each year, beginning 1997&#13;
[para. 6.03b(ii)].&#13;
(b)    Completion of a series of assessments of existing personnel management procedures&#13;
(including appointments, transfers, and the placement of newly appointed personnel), and&#13;
provision of computerized monitoring and evaluation tools to the planning divisions of the&#13;
provincial planning  offices  of the  MEN   (delegations)  by  December  31,  1997.&#13;
[para. 6.03a(ii)].&#13;
(c)    Development of a prospective school mapping methods to take into account such contextual&#13;
variables as family situation and community characteristics and coordinating school&#13;
expansion with other investment programs.&#13;
Proiect Management&#13;
3.13   The last component (US$0.7 million) would support project management and monitoring&#13;
activities.&#13;
IV. COSTS, FINANCING, AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. Summary of Project Costs&#13;
4.01    Total costs of the three projects which, together, constitute the SPP/BAJ, are estimated at&#13;
US$266  million  equivalent.   Total costs of the proposed  first project are estimated  at&#13;
US$97.7 million equivalent, including US$18.0 million for contingencies (18%) and US$13.9&#13;
million for taxes (14%). The foreign exchange component is equivalent to US$39.0 million (47%&#13;
of total project costs excluding taxes). A summary of project costs appears in Table 4. 1. (See also&#13;
Annex 5.)&#13;
4.02   Contingency allowances. Project costs include a contingency allowance --for unforeseen&#13;
physical variations-- equal to US$7.6 million (9% of total project cost excluding taxes). Price&#13;
contingencies between negotiations and project completion are estimated at US$10.4 million (12%&#13;
of total project costs excluding taxes). The following annual rates have been applied: 5% per year&#13;
for local costs, 2.6% per year for foreign costs.&#13;

4.03   Foreign exchange component. The foreign exchange component is estimated as follows:&#13;
construction: 25%; pedagogical material: 35%; furniture: 25%; equipment, vehicles, computers:&#13;
70%; foreign specialists and training abroad: 90%; locally recruited specialists, local training, local&#13;
seminars: 10%. The resulting foreign exchange component is estimated at US$39.0 million,&#13;
representing 47 % of total project costs, excluding taxes.&#13;
4.04   Customs duties and taxes. Directly imported goods and goods procured locally average&#13;
an import duty and taxes of 20%. Indirect taxes on civil works are estimated at 15 %.&#13;
B. Financing&#13;
4.05   The financing of the project would consist of (a) a Bank loan of US$54.0 million equivalent&#13;
(64% of total project costs excluding taxes); (b) parallel cofinancing equivalent to US$1.5 million&#13;
(FF 7.0 million) from France, and representing 1.8% of total project costs excluding taxes; and (c)&#13;
a Government contribution of US$28.3 million equivalent, plus US$13.9 million in taxes. (See&#13;
Table 4.2 and Annex 5). The loan would cover 96% of the foreign exchange costs of the project,&#13;
the remaining 4% would be covered by French Bilateral Cooperation. In addition the loan would&#13;
cover 33% of the local costs (net of taxes). The Government would finance the balance of local&#13;
costs, taxes, and all operating costs associated with the implementation, administration, and&#13;
supervision of the project--including staff salaries and architectural and engineering services.&#13;
During negotiations, the Government provided assurances be that all necessary measures would be&#13;
taken to ensure that adequate and timely financial arrangements were in place at all times for the&#13;
continued and successful operation of the project. This would include providing counterpart funds&#13;
and establishing an individual budget line for the project for the duration of the project, starting with&#13;
the fiscal year 96/97 [para. 6.03b(iii)]. In addition, retroactive financing up to 10% of the loan&#13;
amount was agreed upon during negotiations [para. 6.03b(iv)].&#13;

4.06   It is expected that the component designed to improve school access and retention rates&#13;
(US$52.8 million) would receive parallel cofinancing from France of US$1.5 million equivalent.&#13;
Although of a relatively small monetary value, French participation is of great importance in the&#13;
design of the component, and would bring to the project considerable experience with multigrade&#13;
schooling. Proof of French commitment to cofinance was received at negotiations [para. 6.03b(i)].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Several other agencies --especially UNDP, UNICEF, USAID-- and the European Union (EU) have&#13;
also shown interest in the SPP/BAJ in general, and in the education project in particular. While&#13;
differing Moroccan Government, EU and Bank project cycles has made it impossible to finalize any&#13;
formal cofinancing arrangement with the EU before negotiations, the common interest in improving&#13;
primary education in Morocco's rural areas makes it highly likely that the proposed project would&#13;
benefit from future support from the European Union.&#13;
C. Economic Analysis&#13;
The mix of educational inputs&#13;
4.07   If evenly distributed over a six-year period, the total annual cost of the project would&#13;
average US$16 million, which represents roughly 3% of the total MEN current expenditures&#13;
allocated to basic education, 3 % of the total recurrent MEN budget, and 13% of today's total&#13;
investment MEN budget. As the benefits of investing in basic education are only lightly linked to&#13;
labor market outcomes and are at the same time heavily webbed with externalities, using wages to&#13;
assess the benefits of this investment would not be meaningful, and consequently, a cost-benefit&#13;
analysis would not shed much light on the economic justification of the project. Indeed, evidence&#13;
from various countries suggests that --especially for girls in rural areas-- the social benefits alone&#13;
offset the costs of basic education (World Bank 1992). Therefore, the combination of educational&#13;
inputs included in the proposed project was selected on the grounds that (i) it promotes the project's&#13;
goal of increasing access and retention rates, particularly for girls, while (ii) also improving the&#13;
quality of primary education, and (iii) being cost-effective (see Annex 6).&#13;
4.08   Evidence regarding the determinants of demand for primary education was drawn from&#13;
several surveys including the 1990-91 LSMS, a 1992 survey of rural parents, and a participatory&#13;
appraisal of women's needs, concerns, and views conducted in 1994. The design of the project was&#13;
also influenced by the forecasts presented in the Education PAS, in particular the simulation of&#13;
alternative scenarios for achieving universal primary education and their budgetary implications.&#13;
These various studies and analyses showed that a significant increase in primary school enrollments&#13;
would not be financially feasible unless the MEN adopted extensive use of the multigrade classroom&#13;
model. International experience has shown that this model is not only more cost-effective than the&#13;
traditional, separate-grade model used in Moroccan satellite schools, but that it can also improve&#13;
learning outcomes, as long as adequate teaching methods and materials are available. In the&#13;
Moroccan case a properly organized multigrade teaching system in rural areas --while initially&#13;
increasing teaching kit and training needs-- would eventually lead to savings, both in school&#13;
construction and teaching requirements. Annual savings that could be generated from the adoption&#13;
of multigrade classrooms are estimated to be in the order of US$6 million.&#13;
4.09   On the demand side, studies have failed to confirm certain factors conventionally thought to&#13;
affect girls' schooling rates, such as single-sex schools and female teachers. Factors that did prove&#13;
significant were ranked for their effect on primary school access and retention rates, gender gap-&#13;
reduction, education quality, and cost-effectiveness. Since each factor generally has a combined and&#13;
cumulative effect on several objectives, factors were artificially separated out for the purpose of&#13;
analysis. The design of the project also takes into account the complementarity of its interventions&#13;
with those of its sister projects within the SPP/BAJ --a feature not fully captured by cost-&#13;
effectiveness analysis. For instance, the distribution of free textbooks to girls would miss its target&#13;
if action were not also taken to bring schools closer to home, which implies the need for more&#13;
schools (to be built under the proposed education SPP project) and for better and safer feeder roads&#13;
to walk to the school (to be supplied under the employment promotion SPP project). To quantify&#13;
the many cross-effects of these projects would require careful monitoring during project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
implementation, which would be facilitated by the sector and project indicators MEN is required to&#13;
track throughout the life of the project.&#13;
4.10   Although they constitute together a complete and cohesive package, all single activities&#13;
proposed under the project are cost-effective by international standards. Even a simple computation&#13;
of direct effects (which would clearly underestimate the overall impact of the package) provides a&#13;
solid justification for the proposed education project (Annex 6, Table 3). Most of the individual&#13;
actions (such as the building of latrines) were analyzed in terms of simple presence versus absence.&#13;
Other factors were analyzed in terms of relative cost and potential benefit. Awareness campaigns&#13;
for example cost less than US$3 per new "client"-- lower than any other type of intervention.&#13;
School canteens provide an example of an effective intervention.  They could be replaced by&#13;
targeted food distribution to poor families, or by simple income transfers, for instance; however,&#13;
unlike these alternative solutions, the benefits of a school canteen program accrue directly to the&#13;
target population--school children. The children, moreover, improve their school attendance rate&#13;
along with their caloric intake--a benefit not guaranteed under any direct transfer scheme, no matter&#13;
how well targeted.&#13;
Recurrent costs&#13;
4.11   Incremental recurrent costs associated with the proposed project were estimated on the basis&#13;
of projections included in the Education PAS (Annex 6). Two types of incremental costs were&#13;
assessed: costs accruing during the execution of the project and costs likely to accrue after the&#13;
project ends. The single most important item of the first group is the additional wage bill.&#13;
Computed by comparing teaching and nonteaching staff requirements in the base scenario (status&#13;
quo) and in the project scenario (high case), this additional wage bill would amount to about&#13;
US$32 million annually by the end of the project. Other additional costs to be borne during the&#13;
project's life include maintenance for facilities, equipment, and cars, which would total&#13;
US$0.9 million annually. The main incremental costs following the project's completion would&#13;
come from the Government's commitment to assume the total cost of the school canteen program&#13;
and the complete withdrawal of the World Food Program (US$21.8 million). Other costs likely to&#13;
need a budget allocation after project's completion (textbook distribution, innovative fund, and&#13;
teacher in-service training) would not exceed US$0.5 million per year.  All recurrent costs&#13;
associated with the project (both during and after) would amount to less than US$60 million a year,&#13;
or 3% of the MEN's recurrent budget in 2000-01.&#13;
Cost recovery and sustainability&#13;
4.12   The extent to which such an additional burden could be sustained in future would depend on&#13;
many factors exogenous to the sector (economic growth rate, total national budget). Within the&#13;
primary education subsector, moreover, recovery measures are not envisaged for the near future,&#13;
given the severity of the enrollment situation and evidence that direct costs are a real obstacle to&#13;
girls' enrollment in rural schools. The Education PAS does not recommend that user charges be&#13;
introduced and enforced before the post-primary level. To promote a more rational use of available&#13;
resources, the Education PAS has further recommended a package of measures for improving the&#13;
MEN staff management system (in such areas as teacher training, recruitment, and assignment).&#13;
These measures would allow Morocco to set more reasonable student:teacher ratios at the upper-&#13;
primary and secondary levels, which would generate substantial savings over the medium term.&#13;
These savings could then be added to those gained from instituting multigrade schools would&#13;
substantially increase Morocco's available education budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
4.13   Looking beyond the proposed project, cost-recovery and efficiency measures would go far&#13;
toward reaching the goal of universal primary education. But, to reach this goal, as evidenced by&#13;
the recent public expenditure review undertaken by the Bank (World Bank 1994c), Morocco would&#13;
still have to increase its public spending on primary education by an annual rate of about 5 % for the&#13;
next 6 years. That primary education is a genuine public good and one of the core activities for&#13;
which the Moroccan state has full responsibilities should help to ensure this effort's sustainability.&#13;
Notwithstanding macroeconomic conditions, achieving this end will entail both inter- and intra-&#13;
sectoral reallocations. Donors (especially the European Union after signature of the Free Trade&#13;
Agreement) are also well aware of Morocco's lagging performance in the education sector and&#13;
might well increase their contributions to help the country mount a sincere effort to overcome it.&#13;
D. Management and Implementation&#13;
Program implementation&#13;
4.14   The national Social Development Strategy (SDS) and the SPP/BAJ will be monitored by a&#13;
steering committee made up of all concerned ministers. Such a committee, the Comite de Suivi de&#13;
la Strategie Sociale (CSSS), already exists and is assisted by a Secretariat, which is housed in the&#13;
Ministry of Population's Department of Planning, and is already in place and was actively involved&#13;
in project and program  preparation [para. 6.01c].  The Secretariat will be responsible for&#13;
monitoring the objectives of the SPP/BAJ and will also be the liaison between technical ministries,&#13;
the CSSS, and the donor community (Annex 2). In parallel, an Observatory for Monitoring Living&#13;
Conditions will be created to monitor social conditions in the Kingdom. The formal establishment,&#13;
within the Ministry of Population, of the Observatory would be a condition of Board presentation&#13;
[para. 6.04a].&#13;
4.15   To simplify implementation and avoid the creation of an overall project implementation and&#13;
coordination unit, program activities will be implemented under three distinct projects and financed&#13;
by three distinct loans. The first loan, for the proposed Basic Education Project comprises activities&#13;
to be implemented by the Ministries of Education, Interior, (construction of primary school&#13;
facilities, financed through the VAT and implemented by the communities), and Employment and&#13;
Social Affairs. The second loan (for the Basic Health Project) comprises the activities to be&#13;
implemented by the Ministry of Public Health. The third loan (for the Coordination and Monitoring&#13;
of Social Programs, and Employment Promotion   Project) comprises the activities to be&#13;
implemented by the Ministries of Interior (Promotion Nationale) and Population.&#13;
4.16   The multiple activities included under the SPP/BAJ will require careful programming and&#13;
coordination of inputs from the various implementation agencies at the central, provincial and&#13;
community levels. The individual impact of the three projects, too, could only be measured if&#13;
implementation were sufficiently well-coordinated for each to build on the efforts of the others. To&#13;
ensure that SPP/BAJ activities were implemented in a coordinated manner, both at the grass-roots&#13;
level and in the central ministries, the Government has committed itself to the setting up of a&#13;
Program Management Information System (PMIS) by the Secretariat, and to the implementation of&#13;
the PMIS by the line ministries and the PN. It is expected that the PMIS would be fully operational&#13;
by December 31, 1997. The data input would be performed by the implementation staff at the&#13;
provincial level and at the departmental and division levels in the ministries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
4.17   Project activities will be implemented at three levels: (i) at the central level, by the&#13;
concerned line ministries' departments; (ii) at the provincial level, by representatives appointed by&#13;
the central ministries; and (iii) at the local level, by the communities themselves. Due to several&#13;
factors, including lack of professional implementation staff, cumbersome administrative procedures,&#13;
and lack of expertise in project management, Bank projects in Morocco have moved slowly. But the&#13;
MEN has reorganized its project implementation division and changed several key staff --changes&#13;
that have already improved the implementation of ongoing projects and should meet implementation&#13;
needs of the central ministry. To address the multiplicity of implementation layers and departments,&#13;
furthermore, the MEN will appoint a project education coordinator, and the MEAS will appoint a&#13;
project literacy coordinator by December 31, 1996 [para. 6.03c(i)] to coordinate the implementation&#13;
of all activities included under the proposed project, including the construction of education facilities&#13;
under the Ministry of Interior. Many generic issues--such as cumbersome administrative delays&#13;
caused by the requirement that all documents pertaining to contracts and payments be reviewed in&#13;
advance--still remain. An ongoing study undertaken under the responsibility of the Ministry of&#13;
Finance (Inspection Generale) on reasons for delays in the payment of suppliers should help to&#13;
address this particular problem [para. 6.01b]. The Govermnent will ensure that an action plan to&#13;
improve the management of the proposed project, based on the recommendations of this study be&#13;
presented to the Bank for discussions before March 31, 1997, and that implementation be launched&#13;
no later than October 31, 1997 [para. 6.03c(ii)]. An implementation volume has been prepared,&#13;
which describes in detail the contents and timing of each activity, as well as the resources needed.&#13;
4.18   Activities implemented centrally.&#13;
(a)    Activities to be implemented by the MEN  include national school mapping,&#13;
educational planning, materials, and studies; the procurement of textbooks, educational&#13;
materials, and some furniture. The construction of primary school facilities has been&#13;
transferred to the communities and as such is no longer the responsibility of the MEN but&#13;
of the Ministry of Interior. As reorganized, the MEN now has an implementation division&#13;
capable of administering the proposed project under the authority of the project coordinator.&#13;
Nevertheless, the MEN would need to implement a PMIS to manage the system. The MEN&#13;
would also ensure that a small technical committee be formed to help the coordinator follow&#13;
up the various activities undertaken.   The committee would be composed of (i)&#13;
representatives of the concerned departments in the MEN, and (ii) representatives from&#13;
other donors involved in the project (French Cooperation, UNDP, and other to come). The&#13;
committee would meet twice a year and as needed.&#13;
(b)    With regard to the implementation of the project's proposed literacy activities, the&#13;
Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs has just created a department of literacy, which&#13;
will implement literacy activities in cooperation with the MEN and other ministries&#13;
concerned. The MEAS project coordinator, who will be appointed from this department,&#13;
will also be responsible for liaising with the Promotion Nationale for the organization of&#13;
literacy experiments on the sites selected under the Employment Promotion and Poverty&#13;
Monitoring Project of the SPP/BAJ Program.&#13;
4.19   Activities implemented by provincial representatives.  The procurement of school&#13;
furniture will be delegated by the central ministry to its provincial representatives, who will also&#13;
supervise and assist communities in the construction of primary school facilities.  Morocco's&#13;
provinces have all of the relevant implementation mechanisms and procedures in place, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
sufficient numbers of qualified staff are available to provide the relevant services. By December 31,&#13;
1996, a SPP/BAJ focal point would be appointed in each province to oversee and monitor the&#13;
implementation of all of the SPP/BAJ activities delegated by the various line ministries [para.&#13;
6. 03c(i)].&#13;
4.20   Activities implemented by the communities. Communities will carry out various small-&#13;
scale investments (by building, for instance, classrooms, latrines, canteens, water fountains, dirt&#13;
roads, etc.). The communities will prepare a yearly budget, part of which would be financed&#13;
through proceeds from the VAT. A school facility would be included in the budget only if it had&#13;
first been approved by the School Location Planning division of the central ministry.  Most&#13;
Moroccan communities already have the required managerial know-how to implement the projects&#13;
presently included in their budgets. Whenever a community does not have the required expertise,&#13;
governors would provide the required technical assistance (architects, engineers, site supervisors,&#13;
accountants, etc.).&#13;
4.21   Program   Management  Information  System   (PMIS).  The  responsibilities  for&#13;
administering the PMIS would be divided as follows:&#13;
(a) Provincial level. Each SPP/BAJ provincial focal point would ensure that the PMIS data&#13;
and information was kept up to date. The various provincial delegates would provide the&#13;
provincial SPP/BAJ focal point with all pertinent information about project activities. The&#13;
provincial focal point would ensure that the data was entered into the system and would&#13;
--with the assistance of this tool-- prepare the annual provincial implementation program.&#13;
The PMIS would generate implementation progress reports and reports on various&#13;
indicators and financial benchmarks. The PMIS would be designed on a geographical&#13;
basis, and in such a manner as to allow for the gradual expansion of the system to include&#13;
other data required by the Governor and other users.&#13;
(b) Ministry departmental or divisional level.  Each department involved with the&#13;
SPP/BAJ would be responsible for managing the implementation of their respective project&#13;
activities using the PMIS. To that end, each concerned department would appoint a staff-&#13;
member to manage the PMIS.  Several different departments and divisions within the&#13;
Ministries of Education and of Employment and Social Affairs would be responsible for&#13;
project activities under a ministry-appointed SPP/BAJ coordinator. These two ministry-&#13;
level coordinators would oversee and coordinate the work of the departmental and divisional&#13;
SPP/BAJ coordinators and would be expected to ensure the proper use of the PMIS.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
4.22   All goods and services to be financed by the loan would be procured in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's guidelines. For ICB procedures, the Government would use the Bank standard biddi-ig&#13;
documents, available in French at the time of project negotiations (Marches de Travaux--Taille&#13;
Moyenne and Marches de Fournitures). Procurement of goods and services would be undertaken&#13;
by the concerned line ministries at the central level, by provincial representatives delegated by the&#13;
line ministries, and by the communities themselves. NCB procedures at these three levels have been&#13;
reviewed by the Bank.  The procedures agreed upon are in conformity with general Bank&#13;
procurement guidelines with respect to economy, efficiency, equal opportunity to all eligible&#13;
bidders, development of local industry, and transparency (Table 4.3 below summarizes the&#13;
procurement arrangements for goods and services).&#13;

Note: Figures in parenthesis are the amounts to be financed by the loan&#13;
4.23   Civil works.  The proposed project would include the construction and rehabilitation of&#13;
over 2,000 facilities (classrooms, school latrines, school canteens, teacher housing and water&#13;
fountains). Works contracts would be of small value (from US$8,000 to US$100,000 equivalent&#13;
per facility), and would be distributed over a large rural area. As demonstrated under previous and&#13;
ongoing loans, such contracts do not normally attract foreign firms.  The communities are&#13;
responsible for the financing and implementation of education facilities, and as a result, the&#13;
packaging of contracts is unlikely. Communities are required to follow NCB procedures. Civil&#13;
works contracts of less than US$20.000, up to an aggregate of US$500.000 equivalent, for the&#13;
remodeling of small facilities in remote areas may be carried out by force account with the Bank's&#13;
prior approval.&#13;
4.24   Goods&#13;
(a) Contracts for equipment and materials estimated to cost more than US$500,000&#13;
equivalent each would be procured through ICB (US$20.4 million), with the exception of furniture,&#13;
which could be procured through NCB. Such furniture, manufactured by local suppliers, is of&#13;
excellent quality, below international prices, and delivery and supply would be appropriate for this&#13;
project.&#13;
(b) Contracts for goods costing US$100,000-500,000 equivalent would be procured through&#13;
NCB (US$12.2 million).&#13;
(c) Contracts for goods that the Bank agrees to be of proprietary nature (such as computer&#13;
software, books, and reference materials) could be awarded through direct contracting after&#13;
negotiations with proprietors or publishers in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank&#13;
(US$4.1 million). A contract with a UN agency locally represented would be signed to manage food&#13;
for school activities (US$13.6 million)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
(d) Contracts for goods costing less than US$100,000 equivalent each could be awarded&#13;
through shopping procedures on the basis of three price quotations from suppliers (US$4.1 million).&#13;
4.25   Consultant services. (US$2.5 million) Consultants financed under the project would be&#13;
selected in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for consultants. Consultant services would consist&#13;
of foreign or local specialized services to conduct specific studies or to offer short-term advice. The&#13;
project would also finance study tours abroad, some short-term overseas training, and local&#13;
seminars. The procedures under which such services are engaged are well-known and efficient.&#13;
(Annex 8 summarizes the technical assistance, training, and seminars required). The MEN is&#13;
expected to subcontract with the local UNDP office --which has a long-standing experience of and&#13;
good records in running technical assistance--  entrusting this agency to manage those services.&#13;
Terms of reference are being prepared to this end.&#13;
4.26   Contracts and contract review&#13;
(a)    Items to be disbursed on the basis of proof of services would be subject to Bank&#13;
review as described in Annex 7.&#13;
(b)    Works.  Contracts exceeding US$500,000 equivalent would be subject to prior&#13;
Bank review. Contracts below US$500,000 equivalent would be subject to ex-post Bank&#13;
review.&#13;
(c)    Goods. To ensure compliance with Bank procurement guidelines, procurement&#13;
documentation for all contracts for goods to be awarded through ICB, estimated to cost the&#13;
equivalent of US$500,000 or more would be subject to prior review by the Bank.&#13;
Contracts below US$500,000 in value would be subject to ex post review by Bank&#13;
missions.&#13;
(d)    Consultant services and training. Procurement documentation for all contracts&#13;
for consulting firms, estimated to exceed the equivalent of US$100,000 would be subject to&#13;
prior review by the Bank. Procurement documentation for all contracts for the employment&#13;
of individuals or single source selection of firms estimated to exceed the equivalent of&#13;
US$50,000 would also be subject to prior review by the Bank. Procurement documentation&#13;
for all contracts for consulting firms estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent and&#13;
US$50,000 for all contracts for the employment of individuals or single source selection of&#13;
firms estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$50,000 would be limited to terms of&#13;
references only.&#13;
(e) Contracts and financial data related to activities subject to lump sum disbursement&#13;
procedures will not be subject to post review but will be subject to technical audit (para.&#13;
4.30).&#13;
4.27   Disbursement. The project would be implemented over a period of 5 years. Including a&#13;
12-month disbursement lag, the closing date would be December 31, 2003. The loan would be&#13;
disbursed according to the categories and schedule shown in Tables 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6.&#13;

4.28   Documentation.  In accordance with regular Government procedures, the required&#13;
supporting documents would be retained by the implementing agencies for at least one year after the&#13;
Bank received the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement was made.  This&#13;
documentation would be made available for review by auditors and visiting staff upon request.&#13;
Documentation for contracts subject to lump sum disbursement would consist of a "proof of&#13;
services". This is a certificate established by the borrower, confirming that the specific activity has&#13;
been implemented in accordance with agreed standards and criteria. (Annex 7). The content and&#13;
procedure to establish a proof of service were presented in a format agreed upon during negotiations&#13;
[para. 6.03c(iii)]. Both the disbursement by lump sum and the documentation by proof of services&#13;
are innovative, result-oriented methods aiming at simplifying procedures and accelerating project&#13;
disbursement, while giving more initiative to the beneficiaries (especially communities); they concur&#13;
with the directions set in the new Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits&#13;
(para. 3.15. For expenditures under contracts above the prior review thresholds, full documentation&#13;
would be required. All other expenditures would be disbursed based on Statement of Expenditures&#13;
(SOE).&#13;
4.29   Special account. To reduce the number of claims submitted to the Bank, the Government&#13;
may establish, maintain, and operate --under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank--a Special&#13;
Account in which the Bank would make an initial deposit of up to US$4.0 million. This special&#13;
account would be located in the General Treasury of the Ministry of Finance and would be&#13;
replenished every month, or whenever the undisbursed balance of the account would fall below an&#13;
amount equal to one third or less of the amount of the initial deposit, whichever came first.&#13;
4.30   Accounts and audits. Each department responsible for the implementation of the project in&#13;
the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs would maintain&#13;
separate accounts for all project activities in conformance with international accounting practices.&#13;
Project accounts would be audited in accordance with the Guidelines for Financial Reporting and&#13;
Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (World Bank, March 1982). Activities subject to&#13;
reimbursement on the basis of proof of services would be audited in accordance with OD 10.60,&#13;
para. 48.  For technical audits,  both reimbursement claims using SOEs and applications for&#13;
replenishment of special expenditures from the Special Account would be required to be certified by&#13;
an independent expert rather than by an auditor. The Bank would be provided with an audit report&#13;
of such scope and detail as the Bank might reasonably request (including a separate opinion by the&#13;
auditor on disbursement against a certified statement of expenditures and a certified statement of&#13;
proof of service) within the six months following the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;

Supervision, monitorin2. and evaluation&#13;
4.31   Status of project preparation.   A project implementation volume has been prepared,&#13;
which will be used as a reference during the project's execution. The Secretariat has de facto taken&#13;
over the responsibility for coordinating the preparation of the three projects. The Secretariat has&#13;
convened a number of meetings with other concerned ministries, and has organized a workshop on&#13;
monitoring the implementation of the SDS. Bids would be launched as soon as the corresponding&#13;
budgets were available. The construction of primary school facilities, now the responsibility of&#13;
local communities, would start as soon as the budgets of the communities (based on value-added tax&#13;
revenues) were approved by the Ministry of Interior. But because of budgetary planning, payment,&#13;
and disbursement lags, during the first year of implementation the loan would disburse only the&#13;
amount corresponding to the initial deposit to the Special Account.&#13;
4.32   Project implementation  review.   Each  line ministry  would  prepare  an annual&#13;
implementation progress report of a scope and in the detail agreed upon by the Government and the&#13;
Bank. These reports would be submitted to the Bank not later than September 30, beginning in&#13;
1997 and reviewed jointly [para. 6.03d(ii)]. The annual report would include (a) a review of&#13;
progress achieved in the implementation of the project based on selected monitoring indicators&#13;
agreed upon, (b) projected sector and project expenditures for the year, and (c) programs for project&#13;
activities in the selected provinces. The Secretariat would collect and review sectoral reports issued&#13;
for each of the three BAJ projects, and incorporates them in an annual program implementation&#13;
report. A mid-term project implementation review will be conducted during the third year of&#13;
implementation, no later than June 30, 1999 [para. 6.03d(i)]. This mid-term review would not&#13;
only assess the project's implementation progress in greater detail but would also assess the extent to&#13;
which project activities might need to be redirected to achieve the objectives of the program. In&#13;
particular, a plan for Government funding of the School Canteen Program would be presented at the&#13;
mid-term review, and thoroughly discussed [para. 3.07d].&#13;
4.33   Monitoring indicators. The Government has developed, in coordination with the Bank, a&#13;
list of program and project indicators by which both the process and the impact of the proposed&#13;
operations can be monitored.  The list of indicators was agreed upon before negotiations&#13;
[para. 6.02b], and a final agreement on baseline values and target values for a selected number of&#13;
indicators was reached during negotiations [para. 6.03d(iii)]. The value of these indicators would&#13;
be updated each year and incorporated in the annual implementation report submitted to the Bank&#13;
each year by the Secretariat [para. 6.04d(ii)]. The complete list of indicators is presented in&#13;
Annex 9.&#13;
V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
5.01   As a critical element of the SPP/BAJ, the proposed education project would help the&#13;
Government to sustain its efforts to extend primary school coverage to the poor by targeting&#13;
children in thirteen deprived rural provinces comprising some 27% of Morocco's population. The&#13;
construction and equipment of new schools should allow the system to accommodate about&#13;
65,000 new pupils each year by the end of the project, and the rehabilitation of existing satellite&#13;
schools should permit additional enrollments of about 40,000 children. The reduction of direct and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
indirect costs, the better mix of educational inputs, the higher quality education offered, and the&#13;
measures used to deal with various nonschool factors affecting girls' attendance should also increase&#13;
demand for primary schools and lower dropout rates for hundreds of thousands of rural children.&#13;
These benefits would also compound those derived from other SPP/BAJ projects, which would be&#13;
implemented concurrently in the same communities. Taken together, the projects would improve&#13;
access to basic services and reduce poverty over the longer run. The implementation of the PAS&#13;
would also improve efficiency at the secondary level of education, which would free up resources&#13;
for use at the primary level. Under the SPP/BAJ basic education activities would be integrated with&#13;
provision of other basic services, exposing education policymakers to cross-sectoral innovations and&#13;
establishing a service base that should broaden and strengthen the effect of poverty alleviation&#13;
policies as a whole. Finally, experiments under the literacy component should help to increase the&#13;
sustainability of skills acquisition, thanks to the linkage between learning and employment&#13;
promotion.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
5.02   A first risk is related to the difficulty to bring structural changes in a conservative sector&#13;
and administration, where any move can have far-reaching political effects. The relatively modest&#13;
scope of the reforms being pursued, the in-depth discussion of the sector action plan to be&#13;
implemented, and the political will of the highest levels of the state apparatus will all help to relax&#13;
this constraint, but this sector will always remain sensitive to external and internal shocks.   A&#13;
second risk lies in the extent to which this new operation would succeed in enticing the rural poor,&#13;
and especially girls, into basic education.  Because the project addresses the issue of school&#13;
attendance from the demand side and takes into account the results of studies on the determinants of&#13;
demand and of participatory assessments, this risk is likely to be greatly diminished. The third risk&#13;
stems from the possible delays of implementation, especially for the decentralized activities. To&#13;
advert this risk, the Government would adopt the measures recommended by the study on fund&#13;
flows currently being completed, and a program management information system would be in place&#13;
before project launching. There is also a risk of insufficient counterpart funding, which would be&#13;
mitigated by the preparation of sectoral public expenditure three-year programs, to be jointly&#13;
reviewed each year, and by the establishment of an individualized budget line for the proposed&#13;
project. Finally, the risk associated with the weak implementation capacities of the MEAS in charge&#13;
of the literacy component would be reduced through assistance to be provided by the more&#13;
experienced MEN and thanks to the pilot nature of this component.&#13;
C. Stakeholders' Participation&#13;
5.03   Project preparation has drawn directly or indirectly on the input of final beneficiaries and&#13;
users, including the results of the Bank participatory study on rural women which has shown that&#13;
increasing attendance of girls in primary schools of the poorest douars is contingent upon&#13;
alleviating the most time-consuming domestic chores such as water and fuelwood collection (World&#13;
Bank 1995a). The design of the project itself (which would build schools with wells) and its&#13;
integration with the other projects of the SPP/BAJ Program (which would upgrade basic health&#13;
centers, feeder roads and undertake reforestation) are in line with these needs as expressed by the&#13;
intended beneficiaries. Project design has also been heavily influenced by the results of the survey&#13;
conducted by the MEN amongst 1,600 rural households of the Kingdom, which clearly identifies the&#13;
obstacles to school attendance (MEN 1993). As a result, the project addresses demand factors&#13;
upfront instead of being supply driven. At the intermediate level, the MEN has undertaken a survey&#13;
of a sample of about one thousand schools, which has help to identify the needs at the local&#13;
production level, as expressed by school heads and masters. At the provincial level, MEN staff has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
been widely consulted by central authorities during project preparation. Stakeholders' views would&#13;
also be sought during project implementation through the beneficiary assessments to be conducted at&#13;
the initiative of the Secretariat.  Likewise, a survey has been conducted for the literacy pilot&#13;
component. This survey has included stakeholders at all levels, from the central staff of the MEAS,&#13;
to staff in the learning centers, down to a sample of about 300 beneficiaries. The assessment of the&#13;
latter on the usefulness of traditional literacy campaigns has been taken into account in forging the&#13;
concept of "post literacy"to be tested under the project.  Finally, the other two projects of the&#13;
SPP/BAJ Program have also been prepared with the participation of actual actors and potential&#13;
beneficiaries, thus ensuring that the integrated activities envisaged under the program would&#13;
coincide with real needs perceived by the targeted population, and would mobilize those in charge of&#13;
implementing the measures aimed at meeting these needs.&#13;
D. Poverty Category&#13;
5.04   The proposed project is part of the SPP Program whose entire justification and overarching&#13;
objective is poverty alleviation. All activities under the proposed project would benefit rural areas&#13;
in the thirteen poorest provinces of the country, and would be mostly targeted on girls. Therefore,&#13;
this project would be in the category "Program of targeted interventions".&#13;
E. Environmental Assessment&#13;
5.05   As a category C project, this project would not normally require an environmental&#13;
assessment study. Activities having to do with school location, construction, and design, however,&#13;
would take into account the presence or absence of adequate water supply and safety standards.&#13;

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS DATA&#13;
I      ALTERNATIVES, COSTS AND BENEFICIARIES&#13;
1.     The essence of the economic analysis conducted for the project consists in (i) making sure&#13;
that the activities envisaged address both incentives and obstacles to schooling, and (ii) assessing the&#13;
degree of cost-effectiveness of each activity. Distance to school has a very significant and strong&#13;
impact on girls' probability of access to primary school (see table I). So far, MEN's strategy has been&#13;
to implant "Satellite (incomplete) Schools", offering only the first grades of primary education, in&#13;
villages with a limited number of school-age children, the rationale being that older children would be&#13;
able and willing to walk to the more distant complete "Mother School". The Bank has suggested an&#13;
alternative strategy consisting in the implantation of small complete schools (with two classrooms),&#13;
using extensively multigrade teaching. While this option responds to the need to have schools closer&#13;
from the communities, it has three additional advantages: (a) they offer the complete primary cycle,&#13;
which influences positively the probability of access for boys; (b) they are less costly than the&#13;
traditional single grade teaching, essentially because of a higher pupil/teacher ratio; and (c) multigrade&#13;
teaching, if properly organized with specifically trained teachers and the relevant teaching materials,&#13;
is as effective as single grade teaching (see box). This strategy, which has been agreed upon by the&#13;
Government during the dialogue leading to the project preparation, will be used extensively in the&#13;
project and is estimated to generate savings of approximately $6.5 million per year, at the end of the&#13;
project period.&#13;
2.     A large number of factors are generally considered as potentially influencing access to and&#13;
retention in primary education. The conclusions of a study carried out in 1993 (MEN, 1993) on the&#13;
determinants of schooling in rural areas in Morocco have been systematically used to screen potential&#13;
factors and focus on those having the stronger influence on both access and retention (tables I and 2).&#13;
Female teachers and single-sex schools, which are more costly than coeducational schools, are not&#13;
related to higher access and retention of girls and have not been taken into consideration. The project&#13;
is rather focusing on schooling campaigns, which have strong impact on access and retention of girls,&#13;
canteens, equipped and complete schools. While schooling campaigns are very cost-effective, they&#13;
are just a starting point and cannot be used in isolation: first, schools have to be closer to girls (see&#13;
para above); then, depending upon facilities available in existing schools, canteens, water and latrines,&#13;
and/or a complete cycle may have to be offered in schools characterized by low female enrollments.&#13;
Some of these factors are more cost-effective than others, but in each specific school, it is their mix, in&#13;
relation to the local situation, which is important.  Adult literacy campaigns are taking into&#13;
consideration the impact of mothers' literacy on girls schooling, while the modernization of Koranic&#13;
preschool would partially relieve girls from the task of taking care of young children, which often&#13;
prevents them from going to school.&#13;
3.     The project strategy for raising the quality of primary education is inspired by both research&#13;
results at the international level, since there is no achievement study available on primary education&#13;
in Morocco, and a survey on inputs available in rural primary schools carried out during project&#13;
See for example M. Lockheed and A. Verspoor, 1990. "Improving the Quality of Primary Education in&#13;
Developing Countries: A Review of Policy Options". New York, Oxford University Press&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

preparation. It focuses on kits of teaching materials, teachers guides, classroom furniture (where it is&#13;
missing), remedial teaching for low-achievers, school heads in-service training, first-aid kits and a&#13;
modest component of teachers housing to boost their motivation. The absence of an achievement&#13;
study prevents us from presenting a cost-effectiveness analysis of this sub-component.&#13;
4.     The Basic Health Project and the Employment Promotion and Poverty Monitoring Project of&#13;
the SPP/BAJ Program will contribute to improving health conditions and to developing local&#13;
infrastructure in areas of priority intervention and will therefore have an impact on pupils absenteeism&#13;
and school accessibility and thus reinforce the impact of the proposed Basic Education Project.&#13;
Finally, the implementation of the proposed project in rural Morocco will generate the extemalities&#13;
associated with basic education as shown by international evidence, such as decreased fertility,&#13;
reduced maternal and child mortality, improved health, etc...&#13;
Cost-effectiveness of Multigrade schools&#13;
There are two main policy options to deal with the issue of extending school services to sparsely populated&#13;
areas:&#13;
. using nucleus and satellite schools;&#13;
. using multigrade teaching.&#13;
Comparison of the cost of both options&#13;
The unit cost in rural areas for the nucleus/satellite system is currently 2862 DH, with an average&#13;
student to teacher (STR) ratio of 15. By grouping each two levels in multigrade classes, it is virtually&#13;
possible to double the STR. Due to physical and organizational constraints (usually insufficient classroom&#13;
size and teacher's reluctance to handle very large groups of students) the more conservative assumption of&#13;
reaching an STR of 20 is selected. Under this assumption, and in spite of the additional cost inherent to the&#13;
teaching method (estimated to 40 US$ per student) the unit cost is reduced to 2136 DH, which represents a&#13;
net saving of 25 percent over the current situation.&#13;
The effectiveness of each option&#13;
The effectiveness of each option is measured by its effect on attendance and educational&#13;
achievement. There is strong statistical and field evidence that multigrade teaching has not reduced&#13;
retention in the schools that have been experiencing it. Moreover, it promotes access by allowing (i) the&#13;
extension of the number of complete schools, which has been demonstrated to increases boys' attendance&#13;
by 6 percent, and (ii) bringing schools closer to families, which promotes girls' attendance by as much as&#13;
76 percent.&#13;
As for educational achievement, although multigrade teaching has been introduced and piloted in&#13;
Morocco for several years its impact on achievement has not yet been thoroughly assessed. However,&#13;
where in the world it has been implemented properly, multigrade teaching has been shown to stimulate&#13;
learning and to increase achievement in specific subject areas.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
Under the assumption, supported by international evidence, that multigrade teaching does not&#13;
impede learning, it emerges as a better alternative to the currently extensively used nucleus/satellite option.&#13;
In fact, while it promotes access for both girls and boys, it also saves 25 percent on unit costs.&#13;

11   ASSESSING INCREMENTAL RECURRENT COSTS&#13;
S.     All costs have been assessed on an annual basis, at the end of the project. A first group of&#13;
incremental costs is associated directly with the implementation of the project, and a second group&#13;
would be borne after the end of the project.&#13;
6.     Incremental costs during project's life&#13;
(a)     Additional staff recruited for primary education&#13;
Two projections of enrollments, teaching and non-teaching staff required, and the corresponding&#13;
salary bill have been done, and are included within the Sectoral Action Program. The "Low&#13;
Hypothesis" refers to what would happen without the proposed project, while the "High Hypothesis"&#13;
takes into account the impact of the project (table 4). In order to assess the incremental staff costs&#13;
generated by the project, both projections have been compared. Since specific projections are not&#13;
available for the 13 project provinces, their enrollments have been estimated using current&#13;
proportions. The incremental salary cost generated by the project is the difference between what the&#13;
country would have paid without the project and what it would pay with it: 2,078 - 1,806 = DH 272.0&#13;
million.&#13;

(b)    Maintenance costs of additional cars&#13;
93 cars will be bought under the project. Their annual maintenance costs is assessed at 20% of the&#13;
value of a new car. Additional cost: DH 1.9 million.&#13;
(c)    Maintenance cost for new schools and other construction works&#13;
The annual maintenance cost is estimated at 2% of the value of the building. Over the project period,&#13;
the total value of all school buildings and other construction works is 266.3 DH million. Additional&#13;
cost: DH 5.3 million.&#13;
(d).    Maintenance and supplies for computers and printers&#13;
Additional cost: DH 0.2 million.&#13;
7.    Incremental costs after project completion period&#13;
(a)    School canteen prograrn&#13;
In 1994/95, the Government was contributing $14.0 million to this program, out of a total cost of&#13;
$22.5 million. If the Government was to commit a total substitution of donors' contribution from&#13;
2000/01 on, it would assume the total cost of the SCP at that time ($US million 35.6). Compared with&#13;
its 1994/95 contribution, this would represent an increase of DH 181.4 million. Although more&#13;
analysis will be needed to assess the impact of the SCP both with respect to school attendance and&#13;
school achievements, as well as its targeting and implementation, it is likely that a large portion of the&#13;
SCP will inevitably have to be borne by the state, after WFP's and Bank's withdrawal. Counting on&#13;
the contribution of local communities is probably not realistic at a large scale in the rural regions&#13;
where these communities are particularly short of resources&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 6&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
(b)    Innovation fund&#13;
At the end of the project, the innovation fund will be evaluated. If it were decided to maintain it, after&#13;
evaluation, the additional cost will be DH 2.0 million.&#13;
(c)    In-service training of teachers assigned to multigrade classes&#13;
A one-week training program is going to be given to all 5,100 teachers assigned to multigrade classes&#13;
during the duration of the project. It may be useful to organize a second one-week seminar after the&#13;
end of the project for re-enforcement and evaluation. This will be done over a five-year period for all&#13;
5,100 teachers, at an additional cost of DH 1.2 million.&#13;
(d)     Distribution of free textbooks and school supplies to underprivileged children&#13;
Under the project, 20% of all pupils in rural primary schools in the 13 provinces will receive free&#13;
textbooks and school supplies. Since it may prove difficult to stop this activity, the Government&#13;
should commit to pursue its funding after the end of the project. The additional cost would be DH 0.8&#13;
million per year.&#13;
8.     The total incremental recurrent costs corresponding to activities to be completed during the&#13;
project life would be DH 465 million, and those for activities to be pursued after the project would&#13;
amount to DH 185 million, that is a total of DH 650 million, which would represent about 3 % of&#13;
MEN's recurrent budget around 2000/01.&#13;

PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT UNDER PROOF OF SERVICE&#13;
A "proof of service" is a certificate established by the Government confirming that the specific&#13;
operation, service or activity has been implemented in accordance with agreed standards, criteria&#13;
or terms of references which have been reviewed by the Bank at priori. For a "certificate of&#13;
proof of service" (Certificate) to be awarded the following procedures would have to be&#13;
followed:&#13;
(a) By June of each year, a yearly program of activities, planned to be implemented during the&#13;
next fiscal year, will need to be established for each of the concerned communities. This&#13;
program will be established by the delegates at the provincial levels, submitted for review and&#13;
clearance to the respective line ministries and for approval to the Bank.&#13;
(b) Budgets, corresponding to the approved list of activities, will be made available by the line&#13;
ministries to the provincial delegations. For the construction of primary school facilities, each&#13;
community will include the necessary funds in its annual budget.&#13;
(c) Activities subject to lump sum disbursement procedures will be procured:&#13;
(i) in accordance with National Procurement Procedures&#13;
(ii) for civil works: in accordance with agreed staxEdards or architectural drawings&#13;
reviewed at priori by the Bank; and;&#13;
(iii) for training and seminars in accordance with agreed terms of references established&#13;
for each type of training or seminar, and reviewed by the Bank at priori.&#13;
(iv) Contracts and financial data related to activities subject to lump sum disbursement&#13;
procedures will not be subject to post review.&#13;
(d) Upon completion of the activity, the ministry's representative, accompanied by a technical&#13;
staff (architect or engineer for civil works, educator for seminars, etc.) will inspect the completed&#13;
facility or review the training/seminar, and issue a Certificate of completion and/or a Certificate&#13;
confirming that the training/seminar took place and was delivered as planned. This technical&#13;
Certificate will certify that the described activity has been implemented in accordance with the&#13;
agreed standards, criteria or terms of references, and will be established in a format and&#13;
content acceptable to the Bank. Because the disbursement amount is not a percentage of a&#13;
contract amount, and because the item has been procured in accordance with National&#13;
Procurement Procedures, it will not be required that the certificate mention the cost of the&#13;
operation, nor the procurement procedure.&#13;
(e) This certificate will be forwarded to the concerned Ministry which will prepare a monthly&#13;
Statement of Expenditures (SOE), listing all completed activities. The cost of each activity will&#13;
be the average cost as defined in Table 4.5 of the SAR. The amount to be reimbursed will be the&#13;
lump sum amount per activity, as listed in Table 4.5 and in Schedule I of the Loan Agreement.&#13;
The certificate of completion will also trigger other activities such as providing furniture,&#13;
educational material and teachers for education facilities.&#13;
(f) The annual audit will include an audit (at random) of some of the Certificates. The audit will&#13;
also include a technical audit (at random) of the implemented activities.&#13;

            Morocco - Social Priorities Program : Basic
            Education Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Basic Education
            Project is to contribute to the government's efforts to
            boost its educational system in both qualitative and
            quantitative terms and to make its performance correspond
            more closely to that in economically comparable countries.
            The project will: 1) target the poorest population in the
            country; 2) aim to have an impact on both the supply of and
            demand for education; and 3) affect institutions both
            upstream (Koranic preschools) and downstream (literacy
            education for adults) of the formal education system. The
            project will be concentrated in specific communities located
            in thirteen selected provinces. It will consist of the
            following five components: 1) increase in the access to and
            retention rates of basic schooling; 2) reduction of the gap
            between the school participation rates of boys and girls; 3)
            improvement of education quality; 4) improvement of the
            performance of government literacy programs; and 5)
            provision of technical support to the Ministry of National
            Education to operationalize and implement its Sector Action
            Plan, which aims to reallocate resources to priority
            programs and improve budgetary efficiency.
