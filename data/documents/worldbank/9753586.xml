               Cover images by Paul Olaja. Paul is a 19-year-old artist studying at Kyambogo University in Kampala,&#13;
               Uganda. In his paintings, Paul represents the many facets of youth: youth performing as a way to share&#13;
               their rich culture, working hard to survive, and growing into their adult roles. He depicts the central role of&#13;
               women, the tremendous diversity in the world and how young people strive to become a part of it. In his&#13;
               own words "youth need to do something for the world to hold it up."&#13;
&#13;
               As a teenager, Paul lost his parents to HIV/AIDS. Art is Paul's passion, and his goal is to use art to share&#13;
               the stories of his homeland and to help other young people in need in Africa.&#13;

            World development report 2007 : development
            and the next generation - overview
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Most policy makers know that young
            people will greatly influence the future of their nations.
            Trying to help, they face dilemmas. When primary school
            completion has gone up so dramatically, thanks to public
            investment, why does illiteracy seem so persistent? Why do
            large numbers of university graduates go jobless for months
            or even years, while businesses complain of the lack of
            skilled workers? Why do young people start smoking, when
            there are very visible global campaigns to control it? What
            is to be done with demobilized combatants, still in their
            late teens, which can barely read but are too old to go to
            primary school? Tough questions, these, and there are many
            more. The answers are important for growth and poverty
            reduction. This World Development Report offers a framework
            and provides examples of policies and programs to address
            the issues. Young people and their families make the
            decisions but policies and institutions also affect the
            risks, the opportunities, and ultimately the outcomes.
            Putting a 'youth lens' on these policies, the
            report presents three strategic directions for reform:
            broaden the opportunities for developing human capital by
            expanding access to and improving the quality of education
            and health services by facilitating the start to a working
            life and by giving young people a voice to articulate the
            kind of assistance they want and a chance to participate in
            delivering it. Develop young people's capabilities to
            choose well among these opportunities by recognizing them as
            decision-making agents and by helping ensure that their
            decisions are well informed, adequately resourced, and
            judicious. Provide an effective system of second chances
            through targeted programs that give young people the hope
            and the incentive to catch up from bad luck or bad choices.
