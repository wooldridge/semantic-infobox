&#13;
Guatemala, the most populated State in Central America with 15.7 million people and 3,340&#13;
USD$ GNI per capita in 2013, is an example of early spectrum management liberalization. The&#13;
enactment of the General Telecommunications Law in 1996 in Guatemala was a milestone in&#13;
that countryâ&#128;&#153;s spectrum management. It had big implications also for other developing&#13;
countries as Guatemala was one of the first countries to move in the direction of market&#13;
mechanisms, including auctions, for allocating spectrum. Article 54 states that any person or&#13;
company might request the right to use a non-previously allocated spectrum band. The&#13;
petitioner shall participate in a public tender to obtain a license â&#128;&#156;TÃ­tulo de Usufructo de&#13;
Frecuenciasâ&#128;&#157; (TUF), and once the license is granted, the licensee has the right to determine the&#13;
service and technology to implement. Bands can be leased, sold, or subdivided during the&#13;
period of time set forth in the license and the only restrictions imposed, are the frequency range,&#13;
the maximum power transmitted in the band and at adjacent bands, the geographic scope, and&#13;
license duration. Although not all frequency bands are available within this modelâ&#128;&#148;some are&#13;
reserved for public services and the radio amateur serviceâ&#128;&#148;a big portion of the useable radio&#13;
spectrum is now allocated under this regime in Guatemala. The regulator â&#128;&#156;Superintendencia de&#13;
Telecomunicaciones (SIT)â&#128;&#157; is responsible to enforce the rules and to solve any dispute over&#13;
the rights of use that interferences might cause.&#13;
&#13;
At the time, this approach to spectrum management was revolutionary, since the common&#13;
practice for allocating frequencies was normally the opposite: the regulator specified in a&#13;
license the service and technology to be used in each frequency band, and any change to these&#13;
conditions was not allowed without prior regulatorâ&#128;&#153;s approval.&#13;
&#13;
The idea behind the Guatemalan case, however, is not new; as early as 1959 Ronald Coase&#13;
(1959, 1960) pointed out that a regulator allocating the spectrum would face the problem of&#13;
efficiently assign the frequencies without reliable information on the market value of the band&#13;
and consumer preferences. Furthermore, the regulator would be subject to political pressure,&#13;
thus making allocations potentially inefficient.&#13;
&#13;
Notwithstanding, there are powerful arguments for regulating spectrum allocations as a scarce&#13;
resource. These stem from the likelihood of interference between radio communication&#13;
services, economies of scale, externalities linked to some of the commercial services using the&#13;
spectrum, the existence of services which may be considered pure public goods, along with&#13;
conditioning factors linked to the legacy usage of spectrum. While the concept of best practice&#13;
in spectrum management regime remains controversial, the case of Guatemala is a perfect&#13;
â&#128;&#152;experimentâ&#128;&#153; to discern the effect of policies where the market is afforded a more important&#13;
role in the allocation of frequencies.&#13;
&#13;
When Coase wrote his paper, spectrum scarcity was not a major issue. Nowadays, though,&#13;
spectrum management has become a major policy concern and a topic of increasing interest in&#13;
the economic literature. The extraordinary growth in the use of smartphones and other wireless&#13;
devices and the emergence of new services and applications are increasing traffic demand&#13;
exponentially and consistently spectrum usage. The Radio-communication Bureau of the&#13;
International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the UN specialized agency for&#13;
telecommunications in 2007 estimated the need for additional spectrum for mobile broadband&#13;
as between 1,280 and 1,720 MHz by 2020 (ITU, 2007). But the impressive growth of traffic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                1&#13;
&amp;#12;meant even these forecasts fell short, and ITU is conducting a new review of to update these&#13;
estimates ahead of a future World Radio Conference, where additional allocations for mobile&#13;
broadband may be made, ITU (2013).&#13;
&#13;
Broadband and its wireless component have been identified as a source of increased growth&#13;
and productivity rates; see World Bank (2009), Czernich et al (2011), Koutroumpis (2009). In&#13;
developing countries, the demand for spectrum to unlock mobile broadbandâ&#128;&#153;s potential for&#13;
growth is located in the upper band of the estimates. Wireless access is in many cases the only&#13;
practical and affordable way to expand internet access in developing countries. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s because&#13;
many developing countries lack legacy fixed networks of copper loops and widespread mobile&#13;
coverage undermines the business case for building new ones, especially in rural and sparsely&#13;
populated areas.&#13;

                                         The impact of the reform&#13;
&#13;
In 1996 the Guatemalan Government carried out a spectrum policy reform to liberalize the&#13;
allocation of frequencies. Before the reform, spectrum markets were regulated by a State&#13;
Agency for frequencies below 800 MHz, and a State owned company controlled frequencies&#13;
above 800MHz. Mobile telephony was an exception since it was provided by a private&#13;
company that gave a share of its profits to the stated-owned company. The Guatemalan reform&#13;
was followed by a similar reform in El Salvador.&#13;
&#13;
Mobile telephony and wireless broadband can be considered the most successful commercial&#13;
services using the spectrum over the last 20 years 1 , consequently the amount of spectrum&#13;
devoted to mobile services in the years since the reform is a good indicator of the ability of a&#13;
spectrum management regime to allocate the bands to the usage that the market gives the&#13;
highest value.&#13;
&#13;
Penetration rates, and retail prices are good indicators of a marketâ&#128;&#153;s degree of competition;&#13;
Ibarguren (2003) analyzes the time series of the Guatemalan mobile penetration and the retail&#13;
prices in the years immediately following the reform and compares this data with the time&#13;
1&#13;
  For example a study carried out by Analysys Mason (2012) for the UK, estimates that some 58% of the value of&#13;
radio spectrum in the UKâ&#128;&#147; Â£30.2 billion -comes from public mobile communications. The second most valuable&#13;
service is broadcasting â&#128;&#147; Â£10.8 billion or 21% of total spectrum value.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;series of an average of Latin American countries. Penetration grew in Guatemala at an annually&#13;
compounded rate of 71.7% between 1997 and 2001, compared to 46.8% for the Latin American&#13;
average. Average retail prices for mobile services in Guatemala were only halve2 the Latin&#13;
American average in 2002.&#13;

&amp;#12;Concerning market structure and competition, Figure 4 shows a significant correlation between&#13;
the amount of spectrum allocated to the mobile service and lower figures in the HH Index and&#13;
therefore a higher degree of competition in countries with liberalized spectrum markets. It&#13;
should be noted however, that in the case of Costa Rica mobile telephony was supplied by a&#13;
government monopoly until 2011 and this make more difficult to interpret the data.&#13;

&amp;#12;of spectrum brought about by the reform was the explanatory variable for increased&#13;
competition and fall in retail prices. They found that liberalization has achieved its policy goals&#13;
in the cases of Guatemala and El Salvador. There is a positive relationship between the amount&#13;
of spectrum and the degree of competition and a negative correlation between the amount of&#13;
spectrum and retail prices.&#13;
&#13;
                                              Current situation&#13;
&#13;
Spectrum management policies similar to those of Guatemala, e.g. the use of auctions to&#13;
allocate spectrum, have currently been accomplished by several countries in the region. Some&#13;
of these countries have surpassed the amount of spectrum that Guatemala allocates to the&#13;
mobile service. For example, Dominican Republic, Mexico and Honduras currently exceed&#13;
Guatemalaâ&#128;&#153;s figures.&#13;
&#13;
 Two reasons might explain why other countries in the region have overtaken Guatemala in&#13;
terms of the availability of spectrum to the mobile service. First, although the Guatemalan&#13;
spectrum regime enables the use of market mechanisms to allocate spectrum in the so-called&#13;
regulated bands, the procedures to assess the feasibility and effectively change an allocation&#13;
from public to regulated where market demands additional spectrum have not been addressed&#13;
in the Telecommunications Act.&#13;
&#13;
In April 2015, the Guatemalan spectrum regulator, SIT, transformed the bands 1670-1859 MHz&#13;
and 2110-2290 MHz from frequencies reserved for public usage to regulated bands subject to&#13;
the grant of TUF licenses4. The resolution SIT 265/2015 stated that although the entire suitable&#13;
spectrum available in regulated bands had already been allocated to the mobile service, there&#13;
would not be enough frequencies to meet demand for mobile broadband if additional spectrum&#13;
were not allocated to the mobile service. However one month later, the resolution SIT-369-&#13;
20155 revoked resolution SIT 265/2015 stating that the transformation of the spectrum use from&#13;
public to regulated shall be suspended under the contentious administrative court provisions.&#13;
&#13;
Secondly, it may be difficult to change the use of spectrum even in regulated bands because of&#13;
the existence of coordination failures in the transaction of TUFs in certain bands. For example,&#13;
the broadcasting of television signals is a public service that requires the grant of TUF licenses.&#13;
Broadcasters are willing to change the technology of emissions from analogue to digital in&#13;
order to either diminish the number of TUFs they need to provide the service or increase the&#13;
number of television channels. Potential spectrum users, such as mobile operators, are also&#13;
willing to participate in the auction of frequencies from the analogue to digital transition in&#13;
order to meet demand for mobile broadband. Also the regulator is keen to facilitate the&#13;
transition from analogue to digital because it would allow a more efficient spectrum usage,&#13;
increased revenues for the regulator and enhanced cultural diversity from the increased number&#13;
of television channels. However, for the transition from analogue to digital television to reap&#13;
the benefits of additional services two elements must exist. There should exist a mechanism to&#13;
re-organize frequencies allocated to the broadcasting service to made available a contiguous&#13;
spectrum block suitable for the provision of mobile broadband and a procedure to sell some&#13;
TUFâ&#128;&#153;s from broadcasters to mobile operatorsâ&#128;&#148;or other spectrum usersâ&#128;&#148;in such a way that&#13;
both can benefit from the transaction. This will not occur without a coordinated process&#13;
managed by the regulator. The Guatemalan regulator has lagged behind in this process with&#13;

&amp;#12;regard to other countries such as Mexico that will finish the transition from analogue to digital&#13;
in December 2015 or the Dominican Republic that will also finish the transition in 2015.&#13;
&#13;
                         Conclusions and policy recommendations&#13;
&#13;
Existing literature support the hypothesis of social welfare gains associated with an increased&#13;
market role in spectrum allocation. The case of Guatemala is an example of how market&#13;
mechanisms for allocation can improve competition and efficiency in spectrum markets.&#13;
&#13;
Although initially liberalization allowed Guatemala to leapfrog its regional peer countries&#13;
regarding the amount of spectrum allocated to the mobile service, increased competition and&#13;
lower prices. Allocations are currently similar or less to those accomplished by other countries&#13;
in the region such as Mexico, Dominican Republic or Honduras that also reformed the spectrum&#13;
management regime.&#13;
&#13;
Once the amount of spectrum identified to be granted with TUF licenses have been exhausted&#13;
in Guatemala, the regulator needs to find a way to re-organize existing allocations. Mechanisms&#13;
to assess the change of use from public to regulated where it is feasible and approaches to&#13;
accelerate the change of use in regulated bands when coordination failures exist would help to&#13;
alleviate tensions in spectrum demand.&#13;
&#13;
The â&#128;&#156;Big Bangâ&#128;&#157; reform that entails the possibility to lease, resell, or subdivide the spectrum&#13;
and enables the change of service and technology should be balanced with a more gradual&#13;
approach with increasing rights of use in selected bands. Other possibilities that allow higher&#13;
market participation are also available. The utilization of administered incentive prices , where&#13;
the regulator set administrative fees for the use of spectrum that try to emulate the market price&#13;
of a frequency band in order to introduce price signals and encourage more efficient usage,&#13;
the use of auctions as an allocation mechanism, the flexible use of spectrum authorizing the&#13;
change of technology and service in a particular frequency band, are complementary solutions&#13;
to the definition of property rights, and the existence of a secondary market for spectrum. The&#13;
best approach for each country and spectrum band should be analyzed on a case by case basis.&#13;
The existence of economies of scale in device manufacturing through global and regional&#13;
spectrum harmonization and the advantage of a more important market role in spectrum&#13;
allocations should be weighted in order to find the most efficient solution for each particular&#13;
band and country. One size fit all policy solutions are not possible in spectrum management&#13;
since the legacy usage of a spectrum band might be different in each country and is a key&#13;
element to determine the cost and benefit of each approach.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Guatemala, the most populated State in
            Central America with 15.7 million people and 3,340 United
            States dollar (USD) gross national income (GNI) per capita
            in 2013, is an example of early spectrum management
            liberalization. The enactment of the general
            telecommunications law in 1996 in Guatemala was a milestone
            in that country’s spectrum management. It had big
            implications also for other developing countries as
            Guatemala was one of the first countries to move in the
            direction of market mechanisms, including auctions, for
            allocating spectrum. This approach to spectrum management
            was revolutionary, since the common practice for allocating
            frequencies was normally the opposite: the regulator
            specified in a license the service and technology to be used
            in each frequency band, and any change to these conditions
            was not allowed without prior regulator’s approval. The
            extraordinary growth in the use of smartphones and other
            wireless devices and the emergence of new services and
            applications are increasing traffic demand exponentially and
            consistently spectrum usage. In developing countries, the
            demand for spectrum to unlock mobile broad band’s potential
            for growth is located in the upper band of the estimates.
            Wireless access is in many cases the only practical and
            affordable way to expand internet access in developing
            countries. In 1996 the Guatemalan Government carried out a
            spectrum policy reform to liberalize the allocation of
            frequencies. The amount of spectrum devoted to mobile
            services in the years since the reform is a good indicator
            of the ability of a spectrum management regime to allocate
            the bands to the usage that the market gives the highest value.
