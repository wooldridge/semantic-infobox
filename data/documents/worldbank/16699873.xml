 For instance, the WSP study showed that in the northern Indian city of Ludhiana, an increase in the customer database could have a revenue potential of&#13;
Rs. 181 million, even within the current tariff structure. Similarly, in Pune, a reduction in the levels of NRW to 10 percent can have a revenue potential of&#13;
Rs. 164 million. [USD1 = INR 47, as of October 29, 2009. Conversion rates are from http://coinmill.com; all conversions in the text are approximations.]&#13;

&amp;#12;About the&#13;
Workshop: Context&#13;
and Overview&#13;
In February 2009, the Water and&#13;
Sanitation Programâ&#128;&#147;South Asia&#13;
(WSPâ&#128;&#147;SA) organized an international&#13;
workshop on â&#128;&#152;NRW Managementâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
to share global and South Asian&#13;
experiences on how to promote good&#13;
practices and locate billing and&#13;
collection within the broader framework&#13;
of NRW, as well as catalyze further&#13;
initiatives to reduce NRW.&#13;
&#13;
The workshop was a follow-up event to&#13;
the â&#128;&#152;Customized Clinic on Billing and&#13;
Collectionâ&#128;&#153; in Singapore and Bangkok&#13;
in May 2007 for revenue officials from&#13;
six water utilities and municipal water&#13;
departments in India, Pakistan, and&#13;
Bangladesh. The focus was on&#13;
showcasing revenue management&#13;
best practices in water supply&#13;
agencies, and for helping participants&#13;

    Main Elements of&#13;
    an NRW Strategy&#13;
&#13;
    The case studies presented at the NRW&#13;
    workshop contained several messages&#13;
    relevant to water supply utilities in&#13;
    South Asia today.&#13;
&#13;
    Understanding the Magnitude&#13;
&#13;
    It is essential for every water supply&#13;
    agency to understand the magnitude of&#13;
    NRW even while steadily improving the&#13;
    accuracy of its estimates. The starting&#13;
    point for an effective NRW program is a&#13;
    thorough assessment of the prevailing&#13;
    Water Balance (Box 3), which can help&#13;
    derive the cost or value of NRW and the&#13;
    estimated budget required for its&#13;
    comprehensive reduction. A water audit&#13;
    helps review the Water Balance by&#13;
    estimating how much water is being&#13;
    lost, where and why is it happening, how&#13;
    to reduce losses and improve&#13;
    performance, and how to sustain a&#13;
    strategy that is targeting its reduction&#13;
    and management.&#13;
&#13;
    This is important especially in light of the&#13;
    fact that most South Asian water utilities&#13;
    have little idea about the exact&#13;
    magnitude of NRW, especially in the&#13;
    absence or inaccuracy of metering&#13;
    practices. For instance, in the Penang,&#13;
    Phnom Penh, and Vietnam cases,&#13;
    significant focus was placed on making&#13;
    this an integral part of their NRW&#13;
    strategy. The South Asian water&#13;
    agencies at the workshop provided a&#13;
    rough estimate for NRW to indicate the&#13;
    broad components and operational&#13;
&#13;

The International Water Association has adopted standard terminology around the issue of nonrevenue water which&#13;
can be represented in the following schematic:&#13;

The diagram highlights the following features of NRW (reading from left to right):&#13;
G   Every utility should know its system input volume (produced by abstraction from rivers or from tubewells, and so forth; or&#13;
    purchased from other agencies).&#13;
G   Part of that volume is supplied to consumers as authorized consumption, and the remainder is water losses.&#13;
G   NRW is hence the difference between system input volumes and billed authorized consumption. It consists of unbilled&#13;
    authorized consumption, apparent losses, and real losses.&#13;
G   Authorized consumption has two parts: the part that is billed to consumers (both metered and unmetered); and the&#13;
    part that is not billed, because it is supplied without charge, such as to municipal departments and certain categories of&#13;
    consumers; and because it is supplied to standpipes, fire hydrants, public fountains, and similar facilities. This unbilled&#13;
    portion of authorized consumption does form part of NRW, but it is by no means the whole of NRW.&#13;
G   Water losses also come in two forms: â&#128;&#152;apparentâ&#128;&#153; or â&#128;&#152;commercialâ&#128;&#153; losses, and â&#128;&#152;realâ&#128;&#153; or â&#128;&#152;physicalâ&#128;&#153; losses. Water that is&#13;
    not physically lost, but only apparently lost, includes water supplied through illegal connections; water stolen for resale;&#13;
    water consumption undercounted by inaccurate meters; and water sales that cannot be invoiced because meter&#13;
    numbers cannot be accurately correlated with customer names and addresses. Physical losses include leaks from&#13;
    reticulation systems (especially service connections); leaks from transmission or distribution mains; and overflow and&#13;
    leaks from storage and balance tanks. Such leaks are often the result of poor workmanship, the use of poor materials,&#13;
    and the lack of maintenance.&#13;
G   Successful water supply agencies typically monitor the different components of NRW levels as part of normal&#13;
    management practice, at least monthly.&#13;

&amp;#12;Box 4: Developing rough nonrevenue water estimates in South Asia&#13;
&#13;
The international workshop on nonrevenue water (NRW) management featured a working session in which participants estimated the NRW&#13;
applicable in their own water utility using a simple spreadsheet framework for water audit calculations based on the International Water&#13;
Association (IWA) Water Balance. The estimates were based on the personal knowledge of utility managers of the basic parameters of their&#13;
water supply operations, and not on any detailed measurement or research. Accordingly they are not to be regarded as, in any way,&#13;
definitive. Yet, the exercise required managers to confront the reality of the NRW data applicable to their own operations, and to recognize&#13;
the specific nature of the NRW that confronts them.&#13;

While there are some outliers that seem puzzling, in both countries most of the estimates seem to be within the expected range. The&#13;
estimates ranged from 16 percent up to 71 percent, and the real losses from 100 percent of NRW down to 32 percent.&#13;
&#13;
The exercise was clearly useful in the discussion it generated among participating utility managers as to the true value of the figures being&#13;
suggested, and the implications of the estimates arrived at. It is clear that there are few water supply operations that can afford to ignore&#13;

&amp;#12;a determined strategy of ongoing and&#13;
continuous efforts to control physical&#13;
and commercial losses on a proactive&#13;
basis, supported by a continuous&#13;
monitoring program to maintain target&#13;
levels. This was demonstrated in the&#13;
cases of Penang, Phnom Penh,&#13;
Johannesburg, and Hai Phong, where&#13;
the NRW strategies evolved with time,&#13;
with continuous attention being paid to&#13;
the different aspects of NRW reduction,&#13;
ultimately involving a comprehensive&#13;
improvement of water supply&#13;
operations. These programs are now&#13;
institutionalized so that NRW remains at&#13;
target levels and there is a constant&#13;
search for improving these levels.&#13;
&#13;
Safeguarding Concerns of&#13;
Affordability for Poor People&#13;
&#13;
Successful NRW reduction strategies&#13;
are usually aligned to the issues of&#13;
access and greater affordability for poor&#13;
people to connect to the network. This&#13;
is because poor people are required to&#13;
be brought under the network as part&#13;
of any effective NRW strategy.&#13;
Connecting poor people does not&#13;
necessarily mean compromising on a&#13;
service providerâ&#128;&#153;s ability to subsidize&#13;
services for the poorer sections of the&#13;
population; rather, it allows for&#13;
improved transparency and&#13;
accountability, and for ensuring better&#13;
targeting of subsidies such that they&#13;
are more equitable and actually reach&#13;
poor people.&#13;
&#13;
In many cases people in poor&#13;
settlements, especially in South Asia,&#13;
have resorted to illegal connections&#13;
because the service provider refused to&#13;
connect them due to various reasons&#13;
(such as lack of land ownership titles,&#13;
&#13;
