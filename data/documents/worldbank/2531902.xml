families play a large role in the corporate sector                            the ownership structure of the corporate sector&#13;
and the government is heavily involved in and                                 and the level of institutional development.&#13;
influenced by business, the legal system is less                              Moreover, La Porta and others (1998) show a&#13;
likely to evolve in a way that protects minority                              relationship between the ownership structures&#13;
shareholders and promotes transparent, market-                                of individual corporations and judicial and legal&#13;

To test the argument, the analysis compared the&#13;
concentration of corporate control by families                                In most East Asian economies wealth is&#13;
with three indexes of judicial and legal devel-                               concentrated in the hands of a few families and&#13;
opment: efficiency of the judicial system, rule                               links between government and business are&#13;
of law, and degree of corruption (La Porta and                                extensive. These features may have directly or&#13;
Lopez-de-Silanes 1998). The indexes run from                                  indirectly impeded legal and regulatory devel-&#13;
1 to 10, with 10 indicating the most efficient                                opment. Thus relationships between patterns&#13;
judicial system, strongest rule of law, and least                             of ownership and the characteristics of legal&#13;
corruption. The correlations between the mar-                                 systems are not necessary casual, as has been&#13;
ket capitalization share of the fifteen largest                               suggested for some countries. These findings&#13;
families and low scores for the three indexes                                 imply that in some East Asian economies suc-&#13;
are very strong (table 4). This result suggests                               cessful legal and regulatory reform may require&#13;
that the concentration of corporate control                                   changes in ownership structures and concen-&#13;
plays a major part in the evolution of the legal                              tration of wealth. Findings also suggest that&#13;
system--that there are relationships between                                  insider control may have contributed to the&#13;

            This Note reports an analysis of
            ultimate control in nearly 3,000 publicly traded companies
            in December 1996-before the financial crisis-in nine East
            Asian economies: Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic
            of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan
            (China), and Thailand. The analysis shows that the ten
            largest families in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand
            control half the corporate sector (in terms of market
            capitalization), while the ten largest in Hong Kong and
            Korea control about a third (figure 1). More extreme, in
            Indonesia and the Philippines ultimate control of about 17
            percent of market capitalization can be traced to a single
            family. While the analysis shows that ownership
            concentration in these countries is in keeping with levels
            in other developing and some industrial countries, its
            findings shed light on the viability and vulnerability of
            corporate governance structures in East Asia. The
            concentration of corporate wealth and the tight links
            between corporations and government may have impeded legal
            and regulatory development, directly or indirectly. To
            create incentives for better governance, East Asian
            governments may have to promote more competition, even by
            breaking up conglomerates, and curtail related party lending
            by restricting ownership of banks.
