INCENTIVE-BASED   SUBSIDIES  DESIGNING  OUTPUT-BASED  SUBSIDIES FOR WATER CONSUMPTION&#13;
_________________________________________________________       To obtain a subsidy, a household must apply&#13;
to its municipality, which determines its eligi-&#13;
An eligibility scoring system called CAS is the main tar-  bility mainly on the basis of a scoring system&#13;

their CAS score.                                    depends on  the  level of consumption, and&#13;
results from two aspects of the program's&#13;
design. First, the subsidy is expressed as a per-&#13;
centage of the household's bill. It is therefore a&#13;
Each   year   the   Ministry   of  Planning             price reduction per cubic meter consumed, and&#13;
(Mideplan) determines, for each region, how                no benefits are given if there is no consumption&#13;
many subsidies are to be granted and how they               or deliverY of service. Second, the household&#13;

ciples: The subsidy is based on the willingness to          the limit of 15 cubic meters a month.&#13;

level of consumption should benefit. And the                to  preserve  financial incentives for efficient&#13;
subsidy should cover only the shortfall between             resource use. In essence, the Chilean water sub-&#13;
actual charges and willingness to pay.' As a                sidy can be thought of as a rising block tariff,&#13;
crude proxy for willingness to pay, Mideplan               where only means-tested households have access&#13;
uses the benchmark set by the Pan-American                  to the lower priced initial consumption block.3&#13;
Health   Organization-that  no   household                     The fact that the subsidy scheme requires&#13;
should pay more than 5 percent of its monthly              households to pay a fraction of the bill even&#13;

unclear  whether  vulnerable  households  in               cubic meters helps to maintain good payment&#13;
Chile would be willing to pay more or less than            habits among clients. It also preserves service&#13;
this 5 percent.                                            providers' incentive  to  improve  commercial&#13;

            Incentive-based subsidies : designing
            output-based subsidies for water consumption
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            To guarantee adequate and affordable
            water and sanitation services for vulnerable households,
            Chile introduced an individual means-tested water
            consumption subsidy a decade ago. Although the public
            authorities determine how the subsidy is applied, the mostly
            private companies deliver the service - under a scheme with
            built-in incentives to ensure cost-effective service
            delivery by the companies and low wastage by the customers.
            This case study reviews Chile's experience of using
            tax-funded subsidy payments, contingent on delivery of
            service by water companies. Funding the subsidy through
            general taxation allows the regulator to set tariffs
            according to economic criteria. Targeting allows scarce
            resources to be directed to those who need subsidies most.
            Both characteristics reduce the financial burden on the
            government as compared with the universal subsidy used in
            the past.
