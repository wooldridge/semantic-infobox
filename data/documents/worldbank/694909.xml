KENYA&#13;
EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. PROFILE OF THE CHILD IN KENYA&#13;
1.1   The Kenyan child's chances of survival have improved dramatically since the&#13;
1960's. The country's infant mortality rate fell from 120 to 62 between 1963 and 1993&#13;
and the under five mortality rate from 200 to 96 in the same period. However child&#13;
quality indicators such as levels of morbidity, nutritional status and educability show that&#13;
much remains to be done. Improvements in these indicators seem to have stalled and in&#13;
some cases reversed in the last decade. In the pre-school age group (0-6 years of age),&#13;
stunting - an indicator of chronic malnutrition - was estimated to be 34% in the&#13;
Demographic and Health Survey (1993), up from 32% in 1987. A 1994 UNICEF survey&#13;
found 80% of pre-school children surveyed to have worm infestations while more than&#13;
50% suffer from anemia. Amongst primary school age children, a UNESCO survey&#13;
(1992) found poor health and nutrition status, rising rates of grade repetition,&#13;
absenteeism, poor classroom performance and school dropout. Grade repetition rates are&#13;
13% of total enrollment in primary school. About 20% of children who enroll in primary&#13;
school do not complete Standard IV, and 57% do not complete Standard VIII.&#13;
1.2   Further, these averages mask large differences by economic group and location.&#13;
For example, mortality is more than twice as high for children of mothers with&#13;
incomplete primary education compared with those with secondary education or higher&#13;
and four times as high in the Western and Coast provinces as in Central province.&#13;
Malnutrition is 60% higher in rural than in urban areas and higher in children of mothers&#13;
with incomplete primary education than those with secondary education. The poorest&#13;
decile has a net primary school enrollment of only 62% as compared with 80% for the top&#13;
decile. Children from poor households therefore have a higher risk of mortality, are more&#13;
likely to be malnourished and less likely to attend school than the average Kenyan child.&#13;
Of the 6 million children in Kenya under the age of six, about half are fromfaamilies&#13;
below the poverty line.&#13;
B. EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT: THE CONCEPTUAL BASIS&#13;
1.3   Early childhood development (ECD) is crucial for human capital formation and&#13;
for enhancing the educability of children. There is an increasing body of scientific&#13;
literature pointing to the importance of the first few years of life from the point of view of&#13;
human physical, mental and social development. Developmental deficiencies that occur&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Background                                                                          2&#13;
during this period are difficult and sometimes impossible to reverse. Inadequate physical&#13;
and mental development of children in the pre-school years lead to delayed school&#13;
enrollment, and subsequently to poor progress and performance in school. ECD&#13;
programs can help upgrade the quality of human resources going into the primary school&#13;
system. ECD programs are an excellent preventive investment for groups with potential&#13;
learning difficulties. A number of studies have confirmed that deficits in intellectual&#13;
development in pre-school children that accompany poverty and malnutrition can be&#13;
prevented through improved diets, learning experiences and health surveillance. The&#13;
family is the primary provider of the needs of pre-school children for good nutrition,&#13;
prevention of disease and stimulation. However, the increasing participation of women in&#13;
the labor force, the numbers of female headed households, and changing family structures&#13;
and childrearing practices have created new demands for external support. ECD&#13;
programs are often the first opportunity for inexperienced parents to learn parenting&#13;
skills. Furthermore, ECD programs do release mothers to work and supplement family&#13;
income, and elder siblings (especially sisters) to go to school.&#13;
1.4    Early childhood development programs are usually based on a curriculum arising&#13;
formn a specific theory of early education - the cognitive developmental approach (where&#13;
teacher and child are active participants), the didactic instruction approach, where the&#13;
child is passive and the traditional play based nursery school approach in which the&#13;
teacher is passive, but the child is an active participant. Evaluations of the different&#13;
approaches suggest that the choice of approach is less important for success than&#13;
consistency and quality. Flexible and culturally appropriate approaches are most cost-&#13;
effective and sustainable.&#13;
Box 1 Childcare on Tea Plantations&#13;
A client consultation study describes the daily routine of a tea-picker in Kericho, mother of a one-year&#13;
old in her words as follows: "I'm up by 4.30 am, make uji (porridge), after drinking, wash utensils, and&#13;
leave at 6.30 a.m. to pick tea. After I leave, my older pre-school child takes care of the baby, taking him&#13;
with her to the ECD center. I come home by 5 p.m. After work, I look for vegetables and on Sundays I&#13;
fetch firewood. While the vegetables cook, I bathe, and by 6 p.m., I cook supper. By 7.30 p.m. we are&#13;
all in bed! The elder daughter washes up. I spend 2-3 hours of my waking time each day with my&#13;
children".&#13;
C. CHILD DEVELOPMENT SERVICES IN KENYA&#13;
1.5    The demand for ECD services in Kenya has increased as a result of increasing&#13;
numbers of nuclear families with working/single-parents, most of whom are poor,&#13;
seeking safe custodial care for their children. Results from the Kenya Poverty&#13;
Assessment (1995) indicate that a third of rural households are female-headed. These&#13;
rural households, and those in plantation areas and urban slum settings, have the greatest&#13;
need but are least likely to have access to quality child care. (see Box 1). Parental interest&#13;
in giving children a head start in education and providing opportunities for socialization&#13;
are other reasons for the growth of ECD centers. More and more children entering&#13;
primary schools have had some pre-school experience and in some areas, pre-school&#13;
experience is mandatory for admission to primary school.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Background                                                                       3&#13;
1.6    The demand for ECD services has resulted in the establishment of a network of&#13;
about 20,000 child development centers, mostly in rural areas, covering 1 million&#13;
children primarily in the age group 3-6. The community has been the most important&#13;
partner in the development of the centers, taking responsibility for the provision of&#13;
physical facilities, caregiver salaries, organization of feeding programs and the provision&#13;
of learning and play materials. There is, however, wide variation in the type and quality&#13;
of services provided by these centers. Some communities receive financial and&#13;
supervisory support from NGOs and local govermments.&#13;

coordination. Over a 10-year period, with the assistance of the Bernard van Leer and Aga&#13;
Khan Foundations, NACECE has developed a highly effective training curriculum and&#13;
methodology incorporating adult learning and participatory technologies.&#13;
1.8    The present ECD program is administered through three sections of the Ministry&#13;
of Education: (i) NACECE, which is responsible for technical aspects such as training&#13;
and curriculum development; (ii) the Pre-school Section of the Ministry of Education&#13;
which handles administrative matters such as registration of pre-schools, coordination&#13;
with donors and NGOs, policy guidelines, and inter-sectoral coordination; and (iii) the&#13;
MOE's inspectorate department which is responsible for the maintenance and monitoring&#13;
of standards of the program. The Ministries of Health and Culture and Social Services&#13;
sometimes collaborate in the provision of services. In order to increase participation of&#13;
various partners at the grassroots level, MOE decentralized the program by establishing&#13;
the District Centers for Early Childhood Education (DICECE), which are responsible for&#13;
training of pre-school teachers, developing localized curriculum and mobilizing parents&#13;
and communities and sponsors. In 1995, 57 districts in Kenya had full fledged (with&#13;
residential training facilities) or associate DICECEs.&#13;
D. ISSUES IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT IN KENYA&#13;
1.9    Despite a number of significant achievements in pre-school enrollment, some&#13;
important issues relating to program funding, quality, efficiency and equity need to be&#13;
addressed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Background                                                               4&#13;
1. Low Levels of Investment in ECD&#13;
1.10  Although well documented research findings stress the importance of early&#13;
childhood development for long term human resources development, GOK investment in&#13;
this sub-sector is very small. The government budget allocated to pre-school education&#13;
was less than one percent of the Ministry of Education budget in 1994. Sub-sectoral&#13;
allocations within the MOE's recurrent budget are shown in the following table:&#13;
Table 1 Sub-sectoral Allocations of the MOE's Recurrent Budget (Percentage shares)&#13;
1992/93           1993/94           1994/95&#13;
Pre-primary             0.1               0.1                0.1&#13;
Primary                57.0               59.0              55.0&#13;
Secondary              17.0               18.0              21.0&#13;
University             17.0               16.0              17.0&#13;
Other                   8.0               7.0                7.0&#13;
1.11  GOK's contribution to pre-primary education is approximately US$ 0.60 per child&#13;
year. Corresponding GOK investments at the primary, secondary and university levels&#13;
are US$ 38, US$ 107 and US$ 1,400 (Kenya PER, 1994). The contribution of local&#13;
governments is uneven and diminishing. Government funds are almost exclusively for&#13;
payment of salaries. The 1994 Welfare Monitoring Survey (CBS) showed that&#13;
households are already spending about KSh 1,000 per year on average per pre-school&#13;
child on ECD services, an amount comparable to household expenditure on primary&#13;
education. Clearly GOK is under investing in this sub-sector. However, the&#13;
Government's role mobilizing communities and parents should be emphasized alongside&#13;
this scaling-up of investments in ECD. The sustainability of the program depends on the&#13;
ability of commnities to support the new allocations to this sector.&#13;
2. Quality&#13;
1.12  Untrained Teachers. As a result of the low overall funding levels for this sector,&#13;
associated problems in the quality of pre-school ECD program have come into focus, the&#13;
most serious of which is teacher quality. Pedagogical and practical skills in early child&#13;
development are important for the effectiveness of ECD teachers and their capacity to&#13;
deliver a quality ECD program. Only a third of the pre-school teachers have had any&#13;
training in early childhood development. The present training system which is based on a&#13;
two-year in-service course introduced in 1985 had been developed and refined with donor&#13;
support and experience. Training is conducted in 18 residential DICECE in the country.&#13;
The main problem with the system is that training capacity is roughly 1,200 teachers per&#13;
year against a backlog of about 17,000 who need training and another 5,000 who require&#13;
refresher training. Under the present system, 20% of the training cost is borne by the&#13;
trainees or communities who sponsor them. Community sponsorship of teachers is poor&#13;
as many cannot afford to pay training costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Background                                                               5&#13;
1.13 Inadequate SupervisionlDICECE Capacity. Each DICECE supervises on&#13;
average 350 pre-school centers--from 50 in the smallest district to 760 centers in the&#13;
biggest district. With a typical staff of 6 persons per DICECE of which half of the&#13;
positions are vacant, and little or no transportation facilities, supervision is inadequate&#13;
particularly in districts with dispersed populations. Many centers are not visited at all by&#13;
supervisors who themselves are not sufficiently funded to move around their allotted&#13;
areas.&#13;
1.14 Virtual Absence of Health and Nutrition Services. The period from birth to six&#13;
years of age is the most vulnerable phase of a child's growth and development, when&#13;
adequate care and a sufficient diet are required for building a strong and healthy&#13;
individual. In existing pre-school centers health and nutrition services are hardly&#13;
provided. A 1991 UNICEF evaluation indicates that only 20% of the centers had any&#13;
form of feeding programs. Health check-ups, growth monitoring and immunization are&#13;
generally not performed in these centers.&#13;
3. Efficiency&#13;
1.15 Community Capacity. Community pre-schools are poorly organized and&#13;
managed. The overall resource constraint is exacerbated by the lack of initiative and&#13;
capacity of the pre-school committees to raise and manage finances. Communities do not&#13;
provide adequate support to teachers, compensate them poorly and are reluctant to&#13;
improve facilities, provide materials or attend meetings. In many communities classes&#13;
are held in the open and under trees. There is generally overcrowding as the space overall&#13;
is small and classes are usually large-ranging from 20 to as many as 100 children.&#13;
Improving the ability and will of the community capacity to manage the pre-schools is&#13;
critical to improving the efficiency of the system.&#13;
1.16 Participation of Under-Three Year Olds. The first three years are crucial in the&#13;
physical and psycho-social development of a child. In recent years, as a result of&#13;
increasing numbers of women joining the labor force, urbanization, increase in female-&#13;
headed households and increasing commercialization of farming, many centers in urban&#13;
and plantation areas are reporting a larger presence of children under the age of 3 in pre-&#13;
school centers. At present GOK has no policy with respect to the care of under threes in&#13;
ECD centers and the kinds of services that must be offered to address the special needs of&#13;
this age group.&#13;
1.17  Conditions in Lower Primary School. ECD centers are oriented to providing a&#13;
stimulating child-centered environment where children learn through play. The teaching&#13;
philosophy and methods in the lower grades of primary school are not consistent with&#13;
ECD experiences causing problems of transition for children entering the primary school&#13;
system. The high drop out rates in grades 1 and 2 are partly attributable to difficulty of&#13;
children in adjusting to the formal school system. There is therefore a need to reconcile&#13;
teaching methods and curricula to strengthen the linkages and smooth the transition into&#13;
primary school.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Background                                                               6&#13;
4. Equity&#13;
1.18  Limited Access. Gross enrollment data from the Ministry of Education indicates&#13;
that about 35% of children between 3 and 6 are attending pre-school centers. Net&#13;
enrollment is not easy to ascertain although data from the 1994 Welfare Monitoring&#13;
Survey suggests a net enrollment of about 15%. Attendance in pre-schools varies&#13;
substantially between the beginning and end of school term. District level data indicates&#13;
low participation rates in arid and semi arid regions, in parts of the coastal and western&#13;
provinces and in urban slums. Access by the poor even within districts with high&#13;
coverage are very low. This is due to distance from schools and inability to pay school&#13;
fees.&#13;
E. GOVERNMENT POLICY AND STRATEGY&#13;
1. Sector Policy&#13;
1.19  The 7th Kenya National Development Plan (1994-1997) emphasizes universal&#13;
primary enrollment by the year 2000 and improved transition to secondary education.&#13;
Table I shows the current distribution of the MOE budget which is minuscule for pre-&#13;
school education, and heavily skewed in favor of university education on a per capita&#13;
basis. Recent policy initiatives for a better balance in intra-sectoral allocation include&#13;
cost sharing in public universities and the introduction of bursaries at the secondary level.&#13;
These policy initiatives stem from a reduction in the growth of primary enrollment rates&#13;
as well as transition rates from primary to secondary. A major review of the education&#13;
sector, recently completed, identifies a series of additional cost savings initiatives as well&#13;
as costed improvements that the Government can take to reverse the negative trends to&#13;
access, equity and quality of education in the country. Discussions are underway to&#13;
refine and prioritize these recommendations in order to develop an appropriately timed&#13;
and comprehensive action plan from which to move forward.&#13;
2. Sub-sector Policy&#13;
1.20 The Ministry of Education assumed responsibility for coordinating early&#13;
childhood development in 1980. Policy in this sub-sector has evolved over the last&#13;
decade and important aspects are articulated in the Sessional Paper No. 6 of 1988 and&#13;
National Development Plans (1989/93, 1994/96). Highlights of the policy include:&#13;
(a) the principle of partnership between parents, communities, NGOs, donors and&#13;
government; (b) recognition of the need to provide integrated services that meet the&#13;
social, emotional, cognitive, health, nutrition and care needs of children; and (c) the&#13;
importance of empowering families and communities to meet the needs of children.&#13;
1.21  A Letter of Sub-sector Policy outlining policies that will be implemented as a&#13;
result of the project has been submitted to IDA by GOK (see Annex A). It includes the&#13;
following commitments: (a) increased budgetary allocation for the sub-sector to at least&#13;
1.0 % of the recurrent MOE budget at expiry of the IDA credit; (b) increased training and&#13;
support of pre-school teachers; (c) strengthening of the management of ECD services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Background                                                               7&#13;
from the community to the national level; (d) improved sustainability of ECD services&#13;
and access by the poor; (e) establishment of inter-sectoral coordination and linkages; (f)&#13;
development of policy approaches for the care of children under 3 years of age; and (g)&#13;
establishing linkages between pre-school and primary school. The final Letter of Sub-&#13;
sector Policy, a condition of Board Presentation, was received by IDA on May 23, 1996.&#13;
F. LEARNING FROM OTHER EXPERIENCES&#13;
1. Lessons from Kenya&#13;
1.22 The Aga Khan Foundation, while evaluating its support to preschools in Kenyan&#13;
Muslim communities since 1986, identified the ability and willingness of communities to&#13;
manage and finance their pre-schools as the critical factor affecting quality and&#13;
sustainability. Communities need to be aware of the importance and benefits of early&#13;
childhood education and be willing and able to pay for it. Teacher qualifications and&#13;
training and opportunities to network with peers and communities as well as class size&#13;
and the availability of teaching aids were also identified as important factors affecting&#13;
quality. The foundation has identified the linking of community pre-schools with a&#13;
mechanism for training (and supervision) that is technically, organizationally and&#13;
financially sustainable.&#13;
1.23  The Christian Children's Fund which established an office in Nairobi in 1973 is&#13;
assisting 36,000 children and their families in 78 projects in Kenya. The projects include,&#13;
but are not confined to support to pre-schools. For all programs, money is transferred to&#13;
the community and is managed by a team consisting of a chairperson, secretary and&#13;
treasurer with the approval of a parents' committee. Communities have to complete basic&#13;
management and financial training and employ acceptable accounting procedures before&#13;
they receive funds. The main lesson from the CCF experience is that community&#13;
capacity to manage funds is normally distributed with the bulk of the communities having&#13;
a satisfactory to good performance. Financial misappropriations had been rare due partly&#13;
to the financial controls instituted and to the training in management.&#13;
2. Other Experiences&#13;
1.24 A World Bank sector report on Early Child Development (Young, 1994) classifies&#13;
ECD projects as following one or more of the following approaches: (a) delivering&#13;
services to children through home-based or center-based care; (b) training caregivers and&#13;
educating parents; (c) promoting community and women's development; (d)&#13;
strengthening institutional resources and capacities; and (e) strengthening public&#13;
awareness and demand. Significant ECD projects include Integrated Child Development&#13;
Projects in India and Bolivia, Colombia's Child Development Project, Mexico's Initial&#13;
Education Project, Chile's Parent and Children Program and the Headstart program in the&#13;
United States.&#13;
1.25  Based on research findings and field experience, the following factors have been&#13;
identified as important for effective ECD programs: (i) worker selection, training and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Background                                                               8&#13;
supervision; (ii) community and family involvement/participation; (iii) integrated (health,&#13;
nutrition, education) inputs; and (iv) flexible, non-formal and culturally appropriate&#13;
approaches.&#13;
1.26 Worker Selection, Workload, Training, Supervision. Carefully defined&#13;
recruitment criteria for workers drawn from the local community so that they have&#13;
knowledge of and access to their clients and are trusted by them are the basic common&#13;
factors of effective programs. Workloads that are manageable and focus on high priority&#13;
tasks, decentralized training systems that are reinforced by networking and supportive&#13;
supervision to demonstrate problem solving approaches and provide on the job training&#13;
are other important common features.&#13;
1.27 Community and Family Involvement. Households and communities bear&#13;
primary responsibility for the care and development of children and their participation is&#13;
crucial to the success of child development programs. Mothers, fathers, grandparents and&#13;
siblings are important caregivers and need to be empowered to provide for the&#13;
developmental needs of children. Well designed ECD programs involve the community&#13;
in needs assessment (via client consultation studies) and in the implementation,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of the program.&#13;
1.28 Integrated Inputs. To meet the holistic developmental needs of a child, health,&#13;
nutrition and education inputs are required. Weakness in any one aspect exacerbates&#13;
weaknesses in others. For example, the frequency and severity of illnesses is greater in&#13;
children who are malnourished than those who are not. Children who are sick and&#13;
malnourished are less likely to benefit from stimulation/education inputs. Moreover, the&#13;
synergistic linkages between the health, nutrition and psycho-social development of a&#13;
child ensure that the benefits of the inputs together is greater than the sum of the benefits&#13;
of the individual inputs. It does not follow from an implementation point of view that all&#13;
three inputs have to be delivered by a single implementing agency but that their&#13;
delivery/availability at the level of the child/community has to be coordinated.&#13;
G. RATIONALE FOR BANK/IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.29  Human resources development is the cornerstone of IDA' s social sector strategy&#13;
and ECD provides the foundation for human resources development. Available evidence&#13;
suggests that such investments yield substantial benefits, in particular for children from&#13;
poor households. Current levels of investment in ECD by poor families in Kenya and by&#13;
GOK are inadequate to provide the required minimum package of ECD services. IDA&#13;
can fill the resource gap and use its vast experience in ECD in Latin America and Asia to&#13;
help maximize the returns to the investment.&#13;
1.30  The project will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing ECD services&#13;
in Kenya and will extend access of such senrices in targeted areas and to poor&#13;
households. Without the project, the expansion of ECD services in Kenya would be&#13;
slower, many of those needing ECD services would not have access to them and the&#13;
impact of such services would be less than with the quality improvements that will result&#13;
from the project. The project will help implement one of the recommendations of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Background                                                              9&#13;
Kenya Poverty Assessment by developing human resources in poor households and is&#13;
consistent with the Kenya Country Assistance Strategy that recommends targeted&#13;
interventions for vulnerable groups.&#13;
H. ROLE OF OTHER DONORS&#13;
1.31  The main donors supporting early childhood education in Kenya for the last&#13;
twenty years have been the Bernard van Leer and Aga Khan Foundations. UNICEF&#13;
supports ECD activities in 11 districts including training of personnel, community&#13;
mobilization, curriculum development, health and nutrition activities and research and&#13;
evaluation. The Van Leer and Aga Khan Foundations have been primarily involved in&#13;
support to the NACECE and in developing training, community mobilization and health&#13;
and nutrition activities. While the financial contribution of the donors is quite small they&#13;
have been very important in supporting the indigenous development and expansion of&#13;
ECD services in Kenya. NGOs such as the Christian Children's Fund, Action Aid,&#13;
CARE and various church groups have sponsored significant numbers of child&#13;
care/development centers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The Project                                                           10&#13;
2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY&#13;
2.1   The development objective of the project is to improve quality and educability of&#13;
children in poor Kenyan households. The project seeks to achieve the following impact:&#13;
(a) improved child cognitive and psycho-social development; (b) improved child health&#13;
and nutrition; (c) increased school enrollment at the appropriate age; and (d) reduced&#13;
dropout and repetition rates in lower primary school. An important collateral objective&#13;
would be to improve the human capital potential specifically of poor and otherwise&#13;
disadvantaged pre-schoolers as measured through increased access to ECD services and&#13;
consequent changes in the above impact indicators.&#13;
2.2   The project would follow a two-pronged, phased strategy. First, it would help&#13;
Kenya systematically upgrade the quality and ensure the sustainability of existing&#13;
community owned and managed ECD centers by introducing and adapting best practices&#13;
in the management of these centers. Second, it would pilot a set of targeted interventions&#13;
to improve access to such services for poor communities and disadvantaged households.&#13;
The project would consist of two core components: (a) improving ECD worker training,&#13;
performance and supervision; and (b) community capacity building, mobilization and&#13;
parenting education. Three pilot interventions will test options to develop cost-effective,&#13;
replicable models for: (a) improving the financing of ECD services in poor communities&#13;
by way of community grants; (b) raising nutrition and health standards of pre-schoolers,&#13;
including those in the particularly vulnerable first three years of life; and (c) smoothing&#13;
the transition from pre-school to primary school. Both expansion and pilot-testing would&#13;
be introduced gradually in phase with improved community and Government&#13;
management capacity.&#13;
B. SCOPE, PHASING AND TARGETING&#13;
2.3   The project is targeted to 1.5 million pre-schoolers ages 0 to 6 years in poor&#13;
households. The program also covers parents of these children Selection of districts for&#13;
the implementation of the various pilot packages is based on health and nutrition&#13;
indicators, availability of ECD services, primary school enrollment rates, drop out and&#13;
repetition rates and income. The project would operate in selected districts throughout&#13;
Kenya. It would initially concentrate on upgrading the performance and management of&#13;
around 20,000 existing ECD centers which serve an estimated one million pre-school&#13;
children through teacher training and community capacity building. During this first&#13;
stage, pilot mechanisms for increasing ECD participation by poor children and&#13;
improving the scope and coverage of services would be developed and refined. A second&#13;
stage, involving the implementation of those pilot mechanisms along with expansion of&#13;
ECD services to new areas, would take place as soon as the core program improvement&#13;
components have stabilized. Thus implementation of the proposed nutrition and health&#13;
package, transition program and community grants would take place during the second&#13;
stage. Necessary strategic adjustments will be made at the end of the third year after a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                             11&#13;
mid-term evaluation and last two years of the five year project will be devoted to a&#13;
consolidation phase.&#13;
2.4   The Health and Nutrition component will operate in 14 districts namely, Lamu,&#13;
Kiambu and Thika plantations, Isiolo, Makueni, Mwingi, Garissa, Kisumu, Migori,&#13;
Baringo, Trans Nzoia, Samburu, Turkana and Mt. Elgon. The Community Grants Pilot&#13;
component will be carried out in the following districts: Taita Taveta, Mombasa Tana&#13;
River, Nyeri (Kieni) Tharaka Nithi, Wajir, Siaya Nyamira, Suba, Keiyo, Nandi,&#13;
Marakwet, Narok, Bomet, Busia and Nairobi slums. The transition pilot will cover all&#13;
districts but only in primary schools which have a pre-school within the compound.&#13;
C. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Project Components&#13;
2.5  Improved Teacher Performance Component (US$ 5.0 million). The teacher is&#13;
a key determinant of service quality at the ECD center and his/her effectiveness is&#13;
determined by the teacher's qualifications and training, supervision and support. At&#13;
present, initial teacher training consists of a two year in-service program including 6&#13;
residential sessions of approximately 18 weeks during school holidays. About 1,200&#13;
trainees are admitted to the course each year but the demand far exceeds the number of&#13;
available spaces. "Short courses" are conducted to meet the immediate training&#13;
requirements of some teachers who are not admitted to the regular training program. Of&#13;
approximately 27,000 pre-school teachers in the country, more than 17,000 have not&#13;
received any training. The most pressing issue relating to the ECD effort in Kenya is to&#13;
train the vast numbers of pre-school teachers already teaching children.&#13;
2.6   The project will improve and expand current training courses. Training will be&#13;
offered to 13,000 teachers in the two year training courses respectively over the project&#13;
implementation period. The two year courses will take place in districts with facilities for&#13;
residential training. A nine-month induction course will be organized for the training of&#13;
trainers (TOT). The TOT will be improved to include adult learning and participatory&#13;
methods skills. 250 DICECE trainers will receive training during the course of the&#13;
project. The Pre-school Teacher Education Panel would meet at least once every six&#13;
months to review the training plan and recommend changes. The additional training&#13;
needs will be met by a combination of the following strategies: (a) staffing of DICECEs&#13;
up to the full complement of six trainers and upgrading of select Associate DICECEs; (b)&#13;
a revision in the content and methodology of each residential session; and (c)&#13;
identification of alternate resources including distance education for the training of pre-&#13;
school teachers. A covenant to ensure adequate staffing of the DICECEs with qualified&#13;
persons will be included in the credit agreement.&#13;
2.7   A five week orientation course will be organized for 8,550 teachers in the first&#13;
three years of the project. This course would help meet the needs of untrained teachers&#13;
who cannot be admitted initially to the two year program and will provide the foundation&#13;
for later in-service training. This overview course would consist of 5 modules covering&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                             12&#13;
basic child development, health and nutrition, pre-school activity areas, participation,&#13;
parent education and professionalism. The course will be offered in locations accessible&#13;
to the ECD teachers. Course notes would be prepared in a loose-leaf notebook format so&#13;
that the same materials can be built upon during later training programs. Short courses of&#13;
two week duration will be conducted to serve the needs of refresher training and to help&#13;
trained teachers upgrade their skills. NACECE will be responsible for developing the&#13;
introductory course and evaluating its implementation in collaboration with the Pre-&#13;
school Teacher Education Panel. Costs associated with this course include the&#13;
development of curriculum, printing of course materials, training of trainers and fees for&#13;
trainers. Participants will be required to make a contribution toward the cost of training.&#13;
2.8   Teachers will receive supportive supervision from DICECE staff and other MOE&#13;
personnel and opportunities to meet in an in-service review/training session at least once&#13;
every term and to network and share experiences. The selection of teachers for training&#13;
and the examination process will be streamlined. Details of this component are included&#13;
in Annex B.&#13;
2.9   Community Mobilization and Capacity Building (US$ 3.5 million). This&#13;
component is designed to: (1) mobilize parents and communities to increase the rate of&#13;
enrollment in ECD and improve the quality of ECD services; (2) improve the&#13;
community's capacity to organize, manage and monitor ECD services; and (3) to equip&#13;
parents and communities with relevant parenting skills. A detailed description of this&#13;
component is included in Annex C.&#13;
2.10  Project orientation sessions will be held at the national and district levels to&#13;
familiarize personnel from the different ministries and NGOs about project objectives and&#13;
activities. Traditional venues for community mobilization such as harambee (fund&#13;
raising) meetings, folk media, agriculture shows, PTAs, religious meetings and barazzas&#13;
(meetings of the chief) will be used as opportunities to promote ECD. Community based&#13;
resource centers will be developed in targeted districts. Linkages will be made with&#13;
existing Family Life Training Centers. IEC materials including posters, flash&#13;
cards/charts, radio programs and other mass media campaigns will be developed as part&#13;
of a social marketing strategy to improve ECD. In districts where pilot activities are&#13;
proposed, community participatory development workshops will be used to build&#13;
management capacity in pre-school committees. Communities will learn to prioritize&#13;
ECD needs and inputs, elect a management board and define the tasks of the office&#13;
bearers. These will include defining gaps in service and how to fill these, identification&#13;
of available resources and coordination of inputs, as well as supervising performance.&#13;
This training will be a prerequisite for communities receiving the pilot components. The&#13;
target for this sub-component is to build management capacity in a total of 4,500&#13;
communities during the implementation of the project.&#13;
2.11  Caregivers who will receive parenting education will include mothers,&#13;
grandmothers and childminders employed to provide care for very young children. The&#13;
training will cover the following subjects: milestones of child growth and development,&#13;
needs of children in different phases of growth and development, how children learn, care&#13;
and stimulation, the role of play, etc. The training will be conducted through workshops,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                             13&#13;
seminars and demonstrations lasting for about 2 weeks. Participatory approaches will be&#13;
used. Each training session will cover about 30 caregivers. This component will be&#13;
implemented where necessary with the assistance of NGOs who will be contracted at the&#13;
district level. Costs associated with this component include development of&#13;
communication materials, training, transportation and meeting costs.&#13;
2.12 Health and Nutrition Pilot (US$ 4.5 million). The health and nutrition&#13;
component would test a replicable model emphasizing prevention and promotion to&#13;
optimize health and nutrition standards of pre-school children at the community level.&#13;
The component would initially focus on two target groups: children 3-6 years of age who&#13;
attend ECD centers, and children 1-3 years of age who constitute the next generation of&#13;
center beneficiaries. Efforts will also be made to involve the lower primary classes. The&#13;
principal interventions would be improved caring practices and community-based health&#13;
and nutrition services. Attention would be paid to improving growth patterns of children&#13;
under 1 year of age through parent education for better maternal breastfeeding and&#13;
weaning practices, immunization, feeding and rehabilitation of malnutrition, routine de-&#13;
worming in high-prevalence areas, micronutrient supplementation (iron, Vitamin A and&#13;
iodine in goiter areas), health, nutrition and developmental screening at entry to and exit&#13;
from ECD centers, diagnosis and treatment of common conditions, as well as referral to&#13;
higher levels of care (health center/district hospital). Parental education will also be&#13;
provided to promote improved health behavior and child care in the home and&#13;
environmental health.&#13;
2.13  The health and nutrition pilot will be implemented in about 2,000 existing and&#13;
new centers in 10 districts selected on the basis of high levels of stunting and low levels&#13;
of service coverage. The component would test two different modes of delivery: (a) a&#13;
GOK model, where the pre-school committee selects a community health worker (CHW)&#13;
and the health department provides technical supervision and provides supplies; and (b)&#13;
an NGO model, where a community selected CHW receives support from an NGO who&#13;
does the initial training and periodic follow-up in collaboration with the health&#13;
department. The pilot would be implemented in five different divisions annually&#13;
beginning in the second year of the project and would finance training, equipment,&#13;
medications, and incremental operating costs. Any procurement of drugs and supplies&#13;
under this component will conform to Bank procurement guidelines. Details of this&#13;
component are described in Annex D.&#13;
2.14 Community Grants/Support Pilot (US$ 5.0 million). The objectives of this&#13;
component are: (a) to assist the poorest communities in developing financially viable and&#13;
sustainable ECD services; (b) to assist the most needy pre-school children to access ECD&#13;
services; and (c) to test community-based innovations for financing, managing and&#13;
implementing ECD efforts. The WB (1995) series of studies on early child development&#13;
show that community owned and managed early child development centers (ECD) rely&#13;
almost exclusively on parents' fee contributions for operating and maintenance costs, and&#13;
receive virtually no direct contributions from government. These centers lack sustainable&#13;
financing since fees are inadequate and irregular and are therefore insufficient to pay for&#13;
recurrent costs such as teacher salary, learning materials, maintenance of facilities or for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                             14&#13;
feeding or health services. Committees need to improve the sustainability of these&#13;
centers and develop alternative models for ECD.&#13;
2.15 This pilot will provide ECD grants for 2,000 community/parent-owned ECD&#13;
centers in order to provide them with a steady income stream to meet monthly recurrent&#13;
costs. The maximum grant amount per center over the four years of the project will be&#13;
KSh 125,000 ($2,500). One model proposes that an ECD Trust Fund be created where&#13;
applicable. The Trust Fund will be held in a protected interest bearing trust account in&#13;
the nearest approved bank with three signatories designated by the ECD Committee. The&#13;
account can be used to pay for the center's eligible expenditures (such as augmenting&#13;
teachers salaries, learning materials, center improvements, bursaries and school health&#13;
and nutrition). Every month the ECD committee will deposit the fees collected and make&#13;
withdrawals against pre-approved budget for eligible expenditures which must be&#13;
submitted together with the withdrawal request. Every quarter, the statements of&#13;
expenditure will be sent to the DICECE/NGO with monthly budgets attached for&#13;
accounting and auditing purposes.&#13;
2.16 The annual interest earnings on capital would then enable the community to fund&#13;
a significant proportion of the operating expenses of the ECD center. Parents will&#13;
continue to pay fees (except where it is agreed that fees may be waived in respect of the&#13;
poorest families) and any savings can be used to periodically increase the capital fund.&#13;
The community will be encouraged to further build up the fund since inflation is likely to&#13;
eat up the capital if no new funds are added or if fees are not consistently collected.&#13;
2.17 This financing mechanism is intended to make the ECD center financially self-&#13;
sustainable beginning in the third year of the project. The purpose of the piloting is to&#13;
understand and learn from the experience. Technical assistance in self-management,&#13;
accounting, fund raising (by income generating activities), planning and budgeting will&#13;
be provided. A description of the procedures for selecting the centers, making the award&#13;
and accounting for the funds at each level is in Annex E. Individual approaches will be&#13;
detailed in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to be signed with the selected NGO&#13;
and approved by IDA.&#13;
2.18 Pre-school to Primary School Transition: (US$ 0.8 million). The high drop&#13;
out rates between the first and second grades in Kenya have been attributed in large&#13;
measure to the harsh learning environment in lower primary schools. It is proposed to&#13;
remedy this situation by harmonizing the curriculum and teaching methods in the lower&#13;
primary school with those of pre-school. This component will be piloted in those primary&#13;
schools which have pre-schools attached, i.e., those that share the same premises and&#13;
management committees. The component will facilitate interaction between the pre-&#13;
school and lower primary classes. Project inputs will include the development of&#13;
teaching methodologies and curriculum for lower primary school, retraining of primary&#13;
school teachers, field education officers and primary teachers' college tutors.&#13;
Appropriate teaching materials will be developed.&#13;
2.19  Institutional Strengthening, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 9.7 million).&#13;
This component will strengthen the ECD section of the Ministry of Education and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                             15&#13;
NACECE to manage and implement the program. This involves training and capacity&#13;
building for national and district level management. It also involves the set-up of&#13;
monitoring and evaluation capacity.&#13;
D. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION&#13;
2.20 The National Steering Committee. A description of project management and&#13;
coordination arrangements is in Annex F. The project will receive overall policy and&#13;
strategic direction from an intersectoral ECD Implementation Committee (NECDIC)&#13;
chaired by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education. The composition and terms&#13;
of reference of the committee must be satisfactory to IDA. The Committee would meet at&#13;
least once a quarter to discuss and approve project work plans and budgets, review project&#13;
progress and impact and discuss policy issues arising from the implementation of the&#13;
project. Constitution of the NECDIC is a condition of Board Presentation.&#13;
2.21  The ECD Section of MOE. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education&#13;
(MOE), would have overall responsibility for project management, coordination and the&#13;
overall flow of project funds. The ECD Section in the Directorate Division of the&#13;
Ministry of Education will be strengthened and the head, whose qualifications and&#13;
experience will be satisfactory to IDA, will be named Project Coordinator. The Project&#13;
Coordinator will: (a) be the Secretary of the ECD Implementation Committee; (b)&#13;
facilitate project coordination and implementation and monitor project progress; and (c)&#13;
handle IDA's administrative requirements. The ECD section will be strengthened with&#13;
new professional positions for Monitoring and Evaluation, Health and Nutrition and&#13;
Community Capacity Building, Accounting and Supplies, and two support staff. These&#13;
position have all been filled up.&#13;
2.22 The National Center for Early Childhood Education. NACECE is managed&#13;
by a Coordinator and Deputy Coordinator and has 12 professional staff in 6 sections&#13;
responsible for training, curriculum, child growth and development, community&#13;
education, resources management and research and evaluation. The filling up of key&#13;
vacancies is a condition of effectiveness. Proposals for strengthening this establishment&#13;
are under consideration of the Kenya Institute of Education. Job descriptions of existing&#13;
staff and a staff development plan satisfactory to IDA are to be included in the Project&#13;
Implementation Manual. Funds have been allocated for obtaining the services of&#13;
technical specialists as necessary. Assurances will be sought that NACECE will be&#13;
staffed with suitably qualified persons throughout the project period.&#13;
2.23 The District/Municipal Steering Committee. An intersectoral District ECD&#13;
Implementation Committee (DECDIC) will be constituted at the district municipal level&#13;
and would meet each month to plan and monitor project implementation and coordinate&#13;
the activities of all actors involved in the delivery and promotion of ECD services at the&#13;
district level. The Committee will be chaired by the District Education Officer and the&#13;
Program Officer, DICECE will be the Secretary.&#13;
2.24 District Centers for Early Childhood Education. DICECEs will be staffed up&#13;
to the full existing establishment of 6 trainers and staff strength will be increased to 8 in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                             16&#13;
some DICECEs by the end of the project. This will involve the filling up of 66 vacant&#13;
positions (for which the process has already been initiated by the Teachers' Service&#13;
Commission), and the establishment of essential new positions during the course of the&#13;
project. Supportive technical supervision of pre-school teachers and their ECD activities&#13;
would take place through quarterly visits from DICECE trainers. DICECE will be&#13;
strengthened with necessary equipment and supplies and improved mobility. NACECE&#13;
would have a general oversight role in regard to DICECE supervision. Assurances will&#13;
be sought at negotiations that DICECE will be adequately staffed during the project&#13;
period.&#13;
2.25 Pre-School Committees. Communities themselves would continue to have&#13;
principal responsibility for ECD centers. The management capacity of pre-school&#13;
committees would be strengthened, parenting education would be provided and&#13;
communities would be mobilized for greater participation and involvement in ECD&#13;
services. Pre-schools attached to primary schools would be managed by statutory&#13;
community primary school committees, whose membership would expand to include the&#13;
pre-school teacher and representatives of parents of pre-school children. Terms of&#13;
reference and composition of the committees are elaborated in the Project&#13;
Implementation Manual must be satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
2.26 Management of Individual Components. (a) NACECE will be responsible for&#13;
implementing the core components of Improved Teacher Performance/Training and&#13;
Community Mobilization and Capacity Building. (b) Two implementation models will&#13;
be tested under the Community Grants and Health and Nutrition components. In the first&#13;
model, NGOs will be selected at the national level to implement the pilots in selected&#13;
districts according to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the NGO and&#13;
GOK and approved by IDA. The signing of an MOU with at least two national NGOs is&#13;
a condition of credit effectiveness. The selected NGO will mobilize the communities,&#13;
administer grants, supervise related activities, train Community Health Workers and&#13;
Committees and provide logistic and material support for the activities agreed upon in the&#13;
MOU. In carrying out the above activities, NGOs will work in collaboration with&#13;
established government machinery and other agencies in the district. Criteria for&#13;
selection of NGOs at the national level include an established working relationship with&#13;
GOK, experience in child development activities, i.e., acceptance to work in targeted&#13;
districts, readiness to account for all financial transactions as laid down in the MOU and&#13;
capacity for community mobilization particularly in the administration of grants. In&#13;
addition, the national level NGOs must contribute counterpart funds to cover overhead&#13;
administrative costs and project activities and have financial management capacity. The&#13;
NGOs will be reimbursed for their services for utilization of funds for eligible&#13;
expenditures according to the MOU. The NGOs shall raise a minimum of US$ 100,000&#13;
or 25% of the cost of the proposed activities implemented by them. In the second model,&#13;
GOK will work closely with the ECD committees to implement the same activities as&#13;
listed above in the NGO model. GOK may contract district level NGOs where&#13;
applicable. Funds will flow directly to the districts, where they would be disbursed&#13;
according to work plans approved by NECDIC and DECDIC. (c) The Transition Pilot&#13;
will be implemented by the MOE inspectorate and KIE.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                             1 7&#13;
2.27 Coordination with the Ministry of Health. At the national level, an officer to&#13;
be designated the Health and Nutrition Officer (HNO) will be responsible for the&#13;
coordination of the Health and Nutrition component. The officer will chair a H&amp;N&#13;
working group to assist in the coordination and monitoring of the component. The&#13;
Working Group will have representation from the MOE, MOH, KIE, Inspectorate, NGO&#13;
and selected districts. The HNO will represent the MOE in the MOH National Technical&#13;
Committee to ensure understanding of policy issues and keep the National Committee&#13;
informed of the project progress. The Ministry of Health will be represented in NECDIC.&#13;
At the district level the DICECE will have a Health and Nutrition Officer (HNO) to&#13;
coordinate the Health and Nutrition Component. A Health and Nutrition Committee will&#13;
be constituted to assist the officer in planning, implementation and monitoring of the&#13;
component. The Committee will work closely with the divisional staff to plan and&#13;
budget, implement and monitor the project activities. The health and nutrition officer&#13;
will report on the project progress to the District Health Management Team (DHMT).&#13;
The DHMT will be represented in DECDIC to ensure interdepartmental coordination in&#13;
the implementation of the project.&#13;
E. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
2.28 An effective monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system will be an integral&#13;
component of the project. The M&amp;E component will have three goals: first, to track the&#13;
supply of ECD and other inputs in the project; second, to monitor project outcomes, such&#13;
as increased participation, especially by disadvantaged groups, in ECD centers and&#13;
improved quality of ECD services; and finally, to evaluate the impact of the project and&#13;
its components, on measures of child outcomes, such as the cognitive, social and physical&#13;
development of children. A detailed description of this component is in Annex G.&#13;
2.29 The M&amp;E system will comprise three elements: monitoring, evaluation and&#13;
special studies. Monitoring of input utilization and process outcomes will be performed&#13;
largely at the center level by means of child cards, center registers and wall charts, and a&#13;
survey of ECD centers. Center teachers or workers will aggregate information from child&#13;
cards each month onto a center register and a wall-chart that would be put up in the center&#13;
facility. The center register will also include information on input use, number of&#13;
supervisory visits, and time spent by the center worker in major activities (e.g., teaching,&#13;
health and nutrition, counseling, training, etc.). These data would be transmitted each&#13;
quarter to the DICECE office, where it would be entered in a computerized database and&#13;
analyzed. Simultaneously, the database would be transmitted to the NACECE and the&#13;
MOE.&#13;
2.30 An important element of the MIS will be the supply of certain aggregated&#13;
information and profiles from the DICECEs to each of the centers in the district for&#13;
effective planning purposes. For instance, centers will receive information on how their&#13;
enrollment trends, nutritional status indicators or community mobilization efforts&#13;
compare against those of other centers in the district. The pointing out of specific areas&#13;
of weaknesses and strengths to each center would permit centers to deploy their resources&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                             18&#13;
differently or to target their ECD services more narrowly to specific age, sex or&#13;
socioeconomic groups.&#13;
2.31  The evaluation component will attempt to estimate the impact of the project, and&#13;
its various components, on child outcomes, using household- and child-specific sample&#13;
survey data. It will consist of three parts: (1) a household survey; (2) a survey of ECD&#13;
centers; and (3) a participatory beneficiary assessment. For each, surveys will be&#13;
conducted at baseline (by January 1997) and repeated at mid-term (January 1999) and&#13;
finally at the end of the project (January 2001). For the household survey, sampling&#13;
design will have to be developed so as to ensure inclusion of control households that will&#13;
not have access to project-supported ECD centers as well as sufficient coverage of&#13;
households exposed to different project components. The survey of centers will focus on&#13;
physical facilities, involvement of school and PTA committees in center management;&#13;
teachers, financing and the frequency and coverage of school-wide health and nutrition&#13;
interventions. The participatory beneficiary assessment is intended to assess beneficiary&#13;
needs with reference to child development and responses to the services provided by the&#13;
project.&#13;
2.32 The third element of the M&amp;E system will be special studies that (i) address&#13;
policy development issues, (ii) deal with operational research issues, and (iii) evaluate&#13;
any specific inputs not covered by the regular M&amp;E activities (e.g., training and&#13;
supervision). For example, special studies will be commissioned to monitor the&#13;
qualitative changes taking place among parents and communities in behavior and&#13;
attitudes, as well as monitoring such things as the effectiveness and appropriateness of&#13;
curriculum changes as perceived by teachers.&#13;
2.33  At the national level, the overall manager of the component would be the head of&#13;
the Monitoring and Evaluation group within MOE. He or she would chair an M&amp;E&#13;
working group, whose membership would include representatives from the Ministry of&#13;
Education, Ministry of Health, Central Bureau of Statistics, NGOs and technical&#13;
consultants. At the district level, a steering committee for M&amp;E would be established&#13;
under the chairmanship of the DEO, and would include the District Statistics Officer, the&#13;
DICECE Officer and representatives of pre-school committees, and NGOs. This&#13;
committee would oversee all M&amp;E activities in the district.&#13;
2.34 The M&amp;E component will include a significant amount of training for staff at all&#13;
levels: center teachers and workers, DICECE officers and trainers, and NACECE and&#13;
MOE staff. The training will cover maintenance and updating of child and center&#13;
records, computerized data entry, computerized database management, simple data&#13;
analysis, and the use of analysis for planning and implementation purposes.&#13;

Project Cost and Financing                                                   19&#13;
3. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
A. PROJECT COST&#13;
3.1   The total project cost is estimated at US $35 million equivalent, including taxes&#13;
and physical and price contingencies (US$ 6.5 million) but not including an estimated on-&#13;
going contribution by beneficiaries of about US$ 10 million a year or US$ 50 million&#13;
during the project period. The foreign exchange component is about US$ 5.3 million or&#13;
15% of project cost. Project costs by component are summarized in Table 2. Detailed&#13;
project cost tables are provided in Annex H. Project costs are estimated in March 1996&#13;
prices and include physical contingencies of 5% for vehicles, furniture and equipment,&#13;
5% for supplies, and 2% for maintenance. Price contingencies were calculated 4% in&#13;
1996, 6% in 1997 and 6% for each year until 2001.&#13;

3.2   The estimated cost of community capacity building and mobilization is based on&#13;
recent experiences of the NACECE and NGOs such as the Aga Khan Foundation and&#13;
Christian Children's Fund (CCF) in Kenya. Teacher training expenses are based on the&#13;
current training e-penses of NACECE. Training costs are primarily related to board and&#13;
lodging expenses and costs of training materials. Teacher training will be conducted in&#13;
existing training centers such as Primary Teachers Training Complexes. Appropriate&#13;
rental expenses are budgeted for this purpose. The cost of community grants is estimated&#13;
from recent costing exercises of packages of "good practice" early child development&#13;
services. They are estimated on a per capita basis. The health and nutrition component&#13;
will involve a start up cost -such as provision of weighing scales and materials, and a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Cost and Financing                                              20&#13;
recurrent component estimated at US$ 2 per child per year. The preschool to primary&#13;
school transition component involves the development and testing of curriculum,&#13;
orientation of primary school teachers and pedagogic materials. For institutional&#13;
development, it is expected that the inspectorate and NACECE will be strengthened with&#13;
staff and mobility. For monitoring and evaluation, three surveys are planned and a&#13;
computerized MIS system will be installed at the MOE.&#13;
B. RECURRENT COST AND PRICING SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
3.3   Project incremental recurrent costs will be incurred primarily by expenditures for&#13;
administrative support and salaries of incremental personnel involved in project&#13;
implementation. A total of 66 professionals will be re-deployed to ECD by the end of the&#13;
project period from a teacher pool of over 200,000 primary school teachers managed by&#13;
the Teachers' Service Commission. Re-deployment is expected to occur from&#13;
underutilized primary school training facilities to pre-school training. There will be no&#13;
increase in the total strength of the civil service. Funds required for ECD maintenance&#13;
operations at the end of the project period will be US$ 1.5 million a year or about 1.5 %&#13;
of the MOE budget. Additional costs of expanding the pilot interventions such as&#13;
community grants, health and nutrition materials and services will depend on the success&#13;
of the pilots and GOK interest in replicating/expanding them.&#13;
3.4   Households and communities are already spending about US$ 10 million per year&#13;
on community owned ECD centers. They will continue to be the most important source&#13;
of funds for ECD programs in Kenya and the project's sustainability will rest principally&#13;
on their continuing support. A significant part of the project is directed to capacity&#13;
building of parents and pre-school committees which is expected to enhance the capacity&#13;
of communities to generate additional funding for the development of ECD services.&#13;
Parents will continue to pay appropriate fees in the community run preschools. The&#13;
relative contributions from the main sources of funding are shown in the following table:&#13;

C. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.5   The proposed credit of US$ 27.8 million would finance 79. 1% of the project cost.&#13;
It will cover 90% of the foreign exchange expenditures, and 57% of local costs. The&#13;
government will finance US$ 5.3 million or 15% of the total costs. Donors, through&#13;
selected NGOs, will finance 6% of the project cost. Communities and households&#13;
through their cash and in-kind contributions for the development and upkeep of the early&#13;
&#13;

child centers, and through user fees for households with young children enrolled are&#13;
already contributing about US$ 10 per child year and will continue to be responsible for&#13;
the operational cost of the centers during the project period. Table 4 summarizes the&#13;
financing plan for the project.&#13;

4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
4.1   A Project Preparation Team constituted by the Ministry of Education was&#13;
responsible for the preparation of the project. Members of the team have considerable&#13;
experience in managing ECD services in Kenya and in working with donors such as the&#13;
Bernard van Leer and Aga Khan Foundations and UNICEF. With the assistance of Bank&#13;
missions, the team identified a number of project preparation studies to be prepared with&#13;
a Japanese Project Preparation Grant and selected local consultants to carry out the&#13;
studies. The studies included the following: (1) a nationwide sample survey of existing&#13;
ECD services in Kenya intended to provide a descriptive analysis of the characteristics of&#13;
existing ECD centers classified by location and sponsor; (2) a client consultation survey&#13;
to understand the behavior of households with respect to ECD services with the goal of&#13;
identifying the priority ECD related needs of the target households; (3) ECD services for&#13;
under three year-olds to review program experience in providing services for this&#13;
vulnerable group and recommend program options; (4) a financing study to estimate the&#13;
costs of delivering different ECD services in Kenya and recommend options for&#13;
financing; (5) a management study to recommend a structure for the cost-effective and&#13;
efficient management and supervision of ECD services; (6) a training study to review&#13;
existing training programs and capacity, identify training needs under the project and&#13;
resource requirements; (7) a school health and nutrition services study to review existing&#13;
school health programs and make recommendations for linking them to service provision&#13;
in ECD centers; and (8) a study on the transition from pre-school to primary school to&#13;
recommend ways of assessing child readiness for primary school and ensuring a smooth&#13;
transition from pre-school to primary school. Final draft reports of these studies were&#13;
discussed at a workshop in July 1995 with a group of participants from GOK, donors,&#13;
NGOs and managers of ECD services. Donors and NGOs have participated in a number&#13;
of brainstorming and information sharing sessions during the course of project&#13;
preparation.&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
4.2   The project will be implemented over a five year period (1997-2002) in a phased&#13;
manner. Phasing of the various pilots will be determined by the pace of implementation&#13;
of the core activities - viz. the training of teachers and community capacity building&#13;
which are prerequisites for the implementation of the additional pilot activities. The first&#13;
year of the project will be devoted to implementing the core components in about 5,000&#13;
existing centers and in developing and refining the pilot health and nutrition, grants and&#13;
bursaries and primary school transition activities. The baseline survey of the evaluation&#13;
component will also be implemented in the first few months after project launch. The&#13;
pilot activities will be implemented from the second year onwards and will be assessed&#13;
and fine-tuned during a mid term evaluation by the end of the third year. The last two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation                                                  23&#13;
years will be devoted to further expansion and consolidation of the project. Half-yearly&#13;
project reports will be submitted to IDA. Annual work plans and budgets for each fiscal&#13;
year (July to June) will be submitted to IDA in January each year, following a joint&#13;
review of project implementation. The submission of a draft Annual Work Plan and&#13;
Budget for the first year of implementation has been provided to the Bank. A mid-term&#13;
review of the project will be held in February 1999. The results of the evaluation,&#13;
particularly of the pilots, will be used for purposes of structured learning and any&#13;
necessary adjustments in project design and implementation.&#13;
C. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL&#13;
4.3   A draft Project Implementation Manual (PIM) was submitted to IDA on April 1,&#13;
1996. The outline for the manual is provided in Annex I. The Manual lists the districts&#13;
targeted for implementation of the pilot activities and the criteria for their selection. To&#13;
facilitate the process, a ranking of districts on the basis of composite income, nutrition&#13;
and education indicators was developed. On the basis of these indicators, GOK has made&#13;
a preliminary selection of 24 districts for the implementation of the pilot components.&#13;
The further selection of districts for the implementation of each pilot will be made on the&#13;
basis of on-going activities in the districts. The selection of NGO led and GOK led&#13;
districts, similarly, will be based on the extent and nature of NGO presence in selected&#13;
districts. No district will have more than one type of pilot funding and NGO/GOK will&#13;
provide leadership in a different district. Implementation of the pilots at the community&#13;
level is not expected to begin before a full year of preparation including the selection of&#13;
NGOs and training. The PIM lists the activities under each component, persons&#13;
responsible, time table and costs. The manual also provides job descriptions,&#13;
qualifications, recruitment timetables and work routines for key positions at various&#13;
levels. The submission of a final PIM is a condition of Board Presentation. Any&#13;
subsequent changes to the PIM will be subject to clearance by IDA.&#13;
D. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.4   Management and Procedures. Procurement will be managed by the Preschool&#13;
Sub-Division of the Ministry of Education (MOE). Procurement staff would be&#13;
reassigned within MOE and provided with further training and assistance. The head of&#13;
the PPE section who is the Project Coordinator would report to the Permanent Secretary&#13;
of MOE and be further accountable to the Ministerial Tender Board (MTB), MOE, or the&#13;
Central Tender Board (CTB) for procurement decisions above certain thresholds&#13;
specified in GOK procedures. Measures to modify relevant procurement procedures, in&#13;
order to improve efficiency, would be discussed between GOK and IDA in the broader&#13;
context of the next Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR).&#13;
4.5   As part of the PIM, a draft procurement plan has been prepared. For the first year&#13;
of project implementation it would detail the tasks and time periods for processing the&#13;
required procurement packages, including IDA reviews. The procurement plan would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation                                                  24&#13;
updated periodically and reviewed during supervision missions. Draft bidding documents&#13;
for ICB and NCB procurement will be prepared prior to Board presentation.&#13;
4.6  IDA Guidelines for Procurement (1995, revised in 1996) and IDA Guidelines for&#13;
Use of Consultants (1981) would be followed for all project components funded by the&#13;
IDA Credit. The Bank's Standard Documents for Procurement of Goods (1995) and the&#13;
Bank's Standard Form of Contractfor Consultants' Services (1995) would be used for&#13;
all procurement under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures and&#13;
consultancy contracts for Technical Assistance, respectively. Where no relevant contract&#13;
documents have been issued by the Bank, other forms acceptable to the Association shall&#13;
be used. Eligible domestic suppliers of goods bidding on ICB contracts would receive a&#13;
preference of 15% in bid evaluation, in accordance with Appendix 2 of IDA Guidelines.&#13;
4.7   Prior Review. All procurement packages for goods, drugs and medical supplies,&#13;
materials production and maintenance contracts with an estimated contract value above&#13;
US$ 100,000 would be subject to IDA's prior review, in accordance with Appendix 1 of&#13;
IDA Guidelines. All consulting contracts with firms with a contract value above US$&#13;
100,000 or with individual consultants with a contract value above US$ 50,000 would be&#13;
subject to IDA's prior review. In addition, all terms of reference for proposed consulting&#13;
assignments would be subject to IDA's prior review. Bank's standard bid evaluation&#13;
formats will be used in presenting evaluation reports.&#13;
4.8  In order to ensure that appropriate procedures are being followed, the first three&#13;
contracts for goods, irrespective of contract value, would be subject to IDA prior review.&#13;
During supervision missions, IDA would review one in five randomly selected contracts&#13;
which are below these prior review thresholds. Overall, this review process would cover&#13;
100% of ICB contracts and about 60% of NCB contracts.&#13;
4.9   Procurement Methods. The procurement of vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles,&#13;
office equipment, teaching equipment, tools, drugs and medical supplies, etc. would be&#13;
carried out in reasonable packages of similar goods through:&#13;
(a)   International Competitive Bidding (ICB), if the estimated contract value&#13;
per package is more than US$ 100,000.&#13;
(b)   National Competitive Bidding (NCB), if the estimated contract value per&#13;
package is more than US$ 50,000 but less than US$ 100,000, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$ 4.1 million.&#13;
(c)   International Shopping Procedures (IS) in accordance with Section III of&#13;
IDA Guidelines, on the basis of at least three quotations from reputable&#13;
suppliers in two different countries, if the estimated cost per package is&#13;
more than US$ 20,000 but less than US$ 50,000, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$ 100,000. As an alternative to IS, IAPSO procedures will&#13;
be followed as appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation                                                  25&#13;
(d)   National Shopping Procedures (NS) in accordance with Section III of IDA&#13;
Guidelines, on the basis of at least three quotations from local suppliers, if&#13;
the estimated cost per package is less than US$ 20,000, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$ 80,000. Community grants component will also involve&#13;
very small procurement amrounts as the total grant per center will not&#13;
exceed US$ 5000 over the life of the project. Procurement of such goods&#13;
would be by national shopping procedures which would aggregate not&#13;
more than US$ 1,000,000.&#13;
(e)   Pharmaceuticals will be procured by ICB. However, where these are&#13;
required to be distributed in remote areas in small kits over the project&#13;
period, pharmaceuticals will be procured from UNIPAC or UNICEF up to&#13;
an aggregate of US$ 1.2 million may be arranged provided such items are&#13;
available in their stocks. Such arrangements are considered appropriate in&#13;
this case because of the experience gained by the above agencies in&#13;
supplying these kits in the past.&#13;
4.10  Training. Annual training plans identifying the nature of training, persons to be&#13;
trained, training timetable and venue and estimated cost will be reviewed and cleared&#13;
with IDA. Foreign training shall not exceed US$ 120,000 over the life of the project.&#13;
4.11  Technical Assistance Consultancies. The selection of consultants to provide&#13;
technical assistance, as identified in the project components would be carried out&#13;
according to IDA Guidelines, including shortlisting, letters of invitation and evaluation of&#13;
technical and price proposals. Advertisements in the General Procurement Notices would&#13;
be issued for Goods to be procured through ICB. Consulting assignments that will&#13;
become available under this project will also be advertised. This will assist in the&#13;
preparation of the short list for consulting contracts. Selections for short-term&#13;
assignments and the selection of individual consultants for contracts below the prior&#13;
review threshold would follow simplified procedures specified in Part V of the&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
4.12 The selection of NGOs to provide Technical Assistance would be on a&#13;
competitive basis through shortlisting of several qualified NGOs and otherwise, follow&#13;
IDA Guidelines for Use of Consultants.&#13;
4.13  The aggregate cost of consultancies to provide Technical Assistance is estimated&#13;
at US$ 3.2 million.&#13;

E. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.15   The proposed credit would be disbursed over a five-year period. The project&#13;
completion date will be December 30, 2001 and the credit closing date, June 30, 2002.&#13;
The IDA Disbursement Schedule is shown in Table 6.&#13;

4.16 The project would disburse against 100% of foreign exchange costs and 80% of&#13;
local cost of the costs of goods (vehicles, equipment, pharmaceuticals, and leamning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. Required Documentation&#13;
4.17 Disbursements would be made against standard IDA documentation with the&#13;
following exceptions, for which certified Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) would be&#13;
used: (i) contracts for the procurement of goods costing less than US$ 100,000-&#13;
equivalent; (ii) consultant services contracts by firms costing less than US$ 100,000&#13;
equivalent, and by individuals costing less than US$ 50,000 equivalent; (iii) all operating&#13;
costs; (iv) all local training, and overseas training costing less than US$ 10,000&#13;
equivalent; and (v) community grants. SOEs would be certified by the Project&#13;
Coordinator and the MOE.&#13;
3. Special Account&#13;
4.18  In order to facilitate the availability of funds when needed, on the request of&#13;
GOK, an advance out of the IDA credit will be deposited in US dollars in a Special&#13;
Account to be opened in a commercial bank which will be maintained by the Central&#13;
Bank of Kenya. The authorized allocation to the Special Account will be US$ 1 million.&#13;
The Special Account will be established, operated and maintained on terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to IDA. Upon credit effectiveness the Authorized Allocation will&#13;
be withdrawn from the credit amount and deposited in the Special Account. The initial&#13;
deposit will be replenished on receipt by IDA of satisfactory documentary evidence of&#13;
eligible payments made from the Special Account for goods and services required for the&#13;
project. The sub-contracting of the pilot components for health and nutrition and&#13;
community grants to NGOs and the use of the Paymaster General (PMG) to pre-finance&#13;
project activities should considerably reduce Special Account transactions and simplify&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project Implementation                                                  28&#13;
project accounting requirements. Payments to NGOs below the threshold will be&#13;
reimbursed directly from the main credit account after proper documentation and&#13;
approval.&#13;
4.19 Conditions for operating the Special Account will include the provision of&#13;
advances to the PMG, to cover 90 days estimated operating requirements of the DEOs&#13;
included in the project. For this purpose, the amount to be deposited in the Special&#13;
Account will include four months' estimated requirements of the Districts, to enable each&#13;
previous three-monthly advance to be fully justified with each request for replenishment&#13;
of the Special Account, i.e. the advance outstanding (not justified) at any given time will&#13;
not exceed three months' requirements. The PMG account will be used for local&#13;
expenditures only. GOK shall make appropriate arrangements to ensure timely release of&#13;
the funds.&#13;
F. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
4.20 The Project Coordinator in MOE will be responsible for the maintenance of&#13;
accounts and records to reflect, in accordance with Kenyan and International Accounting&#13;
Standards, all project income and expenditure and assets and liabilities. These accounts&#13;
will include integrated cost and management accounts: (i) to reflect the financial&#13;
performance of each component and sub-component of the project to enable timely and&#13;
appropriate decisions to be taken with regard thereto by NECDIC and DECDIC, and to&#13;
permit comparison with annual budget provisions and project appraisal estimates; and (ii)&#13;
to reflect utilization and availability of external funding by category of expenditure and in&#13;
the currency of the lending agreement. These accounts should be the subject of monthly&#13;
and quarterly financial performance reports and should be reconciled annually with the&#13;
audited financial statements of the project which should be produced within three months&#13;
of the end of the period to which they relate. The first financial statements to be&#13;
produced and audited will relate to the period ended 30th June 1997. The establishment&#13;
of a satisfactory accounting system and supporting internal control structure is a&#13;
condition of effectiveness.&#13;
4.21  Audits of the project accounts will be carried out, in accordance with Kenyan and&#13;
International Standards on Auditing, by independent auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Association. Terms of reference for the Audit are included in the PIM. Audit reports to&#13;
be transmitted to the Association within six months of the end of the period audited will&#13;
include a reporting on weaknesses in accounting procedures and internal controls&#13;
revealed as a result of the audit and recommending measures to overcome such&#13;
weaknesses.&#13;
4.22 Assurances were received at negotiations with respect to the following: (1) GOK&#13;
will maintain records and accounts in accordance with sound accounting practices, to&#13;

Expected Benefits and Risks                                             30&#13;
5. EXPECTED BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1   The first few years of a child's life are crucial in the development of human&#13;
capital. Parents are the primary caregivers in early childhood. Improving parenting skills&#13;
and providing information, education and communication support have been shown in&#13;
ECD projects worldwide to be effective mechanisms for improving child development&#13;
outcomes. Successful IDA supported projects include the Tamil Nadu Integrated&#13;
Nutrition Project and a number of ECD projects in Latin America, notably Colombia,&#13;
Chile and Mexico. The quality of ECD programs is the other important determinant of&#13;
impact on beneficiaries. Teacher training and support and parental involvement are&#13;
important ingredients of high quality programs. Teacher-pupil ratios and learning&#13;
materials also affect program quality. The project will significantly improve the quality&#13;
of ECD services in Kenya and improve access for the project groups.&#13;
5.2   At the end of the fifth year of the project 20,000 ECD centers would have been&#13;
improved in terms of quality, and 5,000 new centers would have been established.&#13;
Quality improvements are expected to benefit 1.2 million children. A total of 13,000&#13;
teachers, 85% of whom are women, would have received additional training who are&#13;
expected to handle existing centers and new centers. In addition a total of 8,000 teachers&#13;
who had been previously trained by NACECE will receive refresher courses to improve&#13;
their teaching methods. Through community grants, the project will specifically provide&#13;
access to improved ECD centers to 200,000 children through grants.&#13;
5.3   By providing early childhood education/stimulation, nutrition and health inputs,&#13;
the project is expected to generate the following benefits:&#13;
(a)   Reduction in grade repetition and improvement in completion rates in&#13;
primary schools. These improvements in efficiency will translate into&#13;
economic benefits measured by fiscal savings on the part of the&#13;
government and financial savings for households. The government spends&#13;
US$ 38 per year per child in primary schools while households spend US$&#13;
17 for a total of US$ 55 per child per year (Kenya Poverty Assessment,&#13;
1995).&#13;
(b)   Incremental lifetime eamings of beneficiaries. Earnings differentials of&#13;
individual earners by educational achievement are based on a national&#13;
household data (Welfare Monitoring Survey, 1994). Direct access by the&#13;
poorest 200,000 children to ECD through community grants will provide&#13;
learning opportunities and therefore improve lifetime earnings. This will&#13;
accelerate the rate of human capital accumulation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Expected Benefi ts and Risks                                              31&#13;
(c)   Improved health/nutrition outcomes which translate into incremental&#13;
lifetime earnings of beneficiaries.&#13;
(d)   Incremental earnings for parents (especially mothers) as a result of&#13;
releasing time for economic activities.&#13;
(e)   Increase in schooling participation for young girls, who would be released&#13;
from child-care chores.&#13;
(f)   Incremental earnings for teachers trained in the program.&#13;
5.4   A benefit-cost analysis of the project gave an economic rate of return of 33%, and&#13;
a net present value (NPV) estimated at US$ 94 million, making the investment highly&#13;
desirable from an economic standpoint. This calculation means that each IDA dollar&#13;
spent for ECD translates into roughly US$ 5 of benefits in present values. Only benefits&#13;
(a) and (b) were quantified indicating that these returns are conservative estimates of the&#13;
real economic benefits from the project. A complete description of the cost-benefit&#13;
assumptions is given in Annex J.&#13;
B. IMPACT ON WOMEN&#13;
5.5   About half of those who will benefit from the improved ECD services are girls.&#13;
The project will also ease the burden of child care on school age girls who are often&#13;
forced to drop out of school to look after pre-school siblings. Data from the Kenya&#13;
Welfare Monitoring Survey, 1994, showed that school enrollment for girls fell by half&#13;
when there was a pre-school child in the household. Increasing access to childcare for&#13;
poor households can have a far-reaching impact on opportunities for schooling for girls.&#13;
Similarly, mothers' time will also be released for other activities.&#13;
5.6   More than 85% of ECD teachers are females. Thus, the continued employment&#13;
and participation in training activities of the 20,000 female teachers would be a&#13;
particularly important impact of the project.&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
5.7   The project is rated "C". It would not have any adverse impact on the&#13;
environment. The health and nutrition component will improve the health conditions of&#13;
the children in the pre-school centers.&#13;
D. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
5.8   As an innovative pilot project testing the feasibility of mechanisms such as the&#13;
transfer of grants directly to communities, the project has substantial risk. Poor&#13;
community oversight resulting in community elite capturing project benefits or the&#13;
misappropriation of funds is a risk. IDA involvement could result in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Expected Benefits and Risks                                               32&#13;
bureaucratization of a flexible system for the provision of child development services.&#13;
The tendency to see child care centers as pre-primary schools and parental pressure to&#13;
teach the 3 R's could result in an extension downward of a rote learning system that does&#13;
not serve the holistic developmental interests of young children. Further, the tendency to&#13;
prescribe teacher certification and pay scales that ignore the realities of the market could&#13;
hurt the normal expansion of pre-school services. The project is intended to increase the&#13;
total investment in young children in Kenya. There is a risk that the project will replace&#13;
or reduce other current sources of investment. To reduce these risks, the project will&#13;
involve reputable NGOs with community development experience in Kenya to assist in&#13;
the implementation of the pilot components. It will promote a non-formal approach to&#13;
early child development and apply market principles in respect of teacher certification&#13;
and pay. Grants will be transferred to communities on a matching basis to encourage&#13;
continued community contribution and there will be considerable investment in capacity&#13;
building for the major stakeholders - viz. parents of pre-school children.&#13;
5.9   Another risk is the possibility that investments in ECD will not result in the&#13;
expected improvements to the cohort of children entering primary school, and thereby&#13;
reducing projected economic benefits. The impact of this risk on project outcomes was&#13;
assessed through a sensitivity analysis, and the conclusion is that even with the most&#13;
conservative assumptions on the projected reduction in dropouts and grade repetition at&#13;
the primary level, the NPV of the project would still be positive.&#13;
E. PROGRAM OBJECTIVE CATEGORY&#13;
5.10  The project falls under the Program Objective Category of poverty reduction and&#13;
would support a program of targeted interventions as part of the national program to&#13;
redress the imbalance in economic opportunities, by investing in the human resources of&#13;
the poorest households, and the most backward districts in terms of social sector&#13;
indicators such as malnutrition and poor access to health and education.&#13;

organized and managed by parents' associations, and the rest ire&#13;
sponsored by religious organizati:ns, local authorities, NGOs and&#13;
the private sectcr.   however,  more than two thirds of childfen&#13;
between aces 3-E years do not have access to these services, and&#13;
poorer househol-ds are less likely than others  to benefit from&#13;

9.   The .level of gcvernment budgetary allocation fcr pre-sch?ol&#13;

Ministry of Education budget.  The bulk of investments in BCD are&#13;
borne by parents w1hose budgets are increasingly being sqeezedlby&#13;
com- eting household expenditures.  The gcvernment and donors (such&#13;
as Ber-nard Van Leer Foundacion, UNICEF and the Aga Khan Foumdation)&#13;
provide support for care-giver/teacher training, curriculum and&#13;
materials developmenz, community mobilization and moniObrinc.  The&#13;
low level of overall public and household funding fcr this s9b-&#13;

TEACHER PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT &amp; TRAINING COMPONENT&#13;
Background and Objectives&#13;
1.    This component is intended to equip: (a) ECE teachers with appropriate service&#13;
delivery skills and (b) project staff to manage the ECE program. The specific objectives&#13;
of the component are to train:&#13;
(a)   13,000 previously-untrained ECE teachers in an existing two year in-&#13;
service course, which the project would upgrade&#13;
(b)   8,550 previously-untrained teachers in a five-week Orientation Course&#13;
during the first three years of the project&#13;
(c)   50 teachers a year in each DICECE in two-week specialized courses&#13;
(d)   head-teachers, zonal school inspectors, local authority and other staff in a&#13;
one-month&#13;
(e)   supervisory skills course.&#13;
(f)   250 DICECE staff on community mobilization, communication skills and&#13;
other specialized short courses&#13;
(g)   250 DICECE staff in an existing 9-month training of trainers (TOT)&#13;
course&#13;
(h)   30 NACECE and Ministry of Education staff in management, community&#13;
mobilization and communication and writing skills through short and long&#13;
term courses internally and externally, advanced degree training and&#13;
orientation programs for new staff.&#13;
Program Content&#13;
ECEC Teacher Training&#13;
2.    Training Strategy and Approach. The basic and alternative ECEC teacher&#13;
training courses will be conducted in 6 three-week sessions during school holidays over&#13;
two years. Training will be offered to 13,000 teachers over the project implementation&#13;
period. The two-year courses will take place in the 26 districts with DICECE facilities&#13;
for residential training. The training teams would consist of a combination of DICECE&#13;
staff and external facilitators.&#13;
3.    During the first project year, NACECE will implement a five week Orientation&#13;
course for untrained ECEC teachers. The purpose of this five-week course is to ensure&#13;
that within the first three years of the project, all untrained ECEC teachers get some basic&#13;
knowledge while they await formal training. The Government also will decide whether&#13;
to shorten the two-year basic and alternative courses to reflect skills imparted during the&#13;
five-week orientation course.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
4.    Curricula and Training Materials Development. NACECE panels would&#13;
review current curricula for ECEC teacher training to correct identified weaknesses.&#13;
Curriculum revisions could include more effective approaches to caring/talking to&#13;
children, resource management skills, adult learning, basic reading and writing skills,&#13;
communication, young child health and nutrition and community mobilization. The&#13;
panels also would review training support materials. Modification or development of&#13;
training support materials would be done at NACECE, perhaps by contracting with&#13;
specialized outside groups.&#13;
5.    New curricula and training support materials which would be developed or&#13;
modified include:&#13;
(a)   Revised curriculum for the two year and five week courses&#13;
(b)   Revised TOT curricula&#13;
(c)   A manual for pre-school teachers (to include in addition skills such as&#13;
health and nutrition, parental education, working with school heads,&#13;
linkages with primary schools, self confidence and self reliance skills)&#13;
(d)   A manual for trainers&#13;
(e)   Guidelines for training of supervisors&#13;
6.    Training Output. The 26 fully-fledged DICECEs will continue to conduct the&#13;
regular and alternative ECEC teacher training courses, which currently take two years to&#13;
complete. Most of the fully-fledged DICECEs now have a training staff of 3 to 4, but&#13;
take more staff from the other DICECEs and external facilitators during training as&#13;
necessary. Each fully fledged DICECE can accommodate 100 ECEC teachers at any one&#13;
time in the regular course, resulting in a total output of 2,600 teachers a year. Assuming&#13;
that 2,000 ECEC teachers are currently in training and will graduate in year one of the&#13;
project, 13,000 ECEC teachers could be trained through the regular course over the five-&#13;
year project period.&#13;
7.    The alternative course uses the same curriculum as the regular course, but sets&#13;
different examinations. It is intended for teachers who are below fourth form and come&#13;
from hardship areas such as ASAL and for some traditional Maalim and Duksi teachers&#13;
of the Islamic Integrated Curriculum. If the alternative course continues to be offered in&#13;
each of ten DICECEs for a single batch of 50 teachers, a total of 1,500 teachers of the&#13;
13,000 teachers could be trained in the alternative course during the five-year project&#13;
period.&#13;
8.    The five week orientation course for untrained teachers while they wait to be&#13;
taken to full training courses will consist of 5 modules covering: (1) child development;&#13;
(2) health and nutrition; (3) pre-school activities; (4) parental involvement/education; and&#13;
(5) professional development. DICECEs will have flexibility to schedule the orientation&#13;
training to suit local circumstances. It is estimated that each DICECE will train 50&#13;
teachers every year through this course during the first three years of the project for a&#13;
total of 8550.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
9.    The supervisory skills course would be part of a process of institutionalizing&#13;
responsibility for technical supervision of pre-school teachers at the zonal or local level&#13;
through zonal school inspectors (ZSIs) or primary school head masters.&#13;
10.   As part of the process of strengthening community mobilization (See&#13;
Commentary Mobilization Component), the project would train at least one existing&#13;
Community Development Officer in each district. By strengthening their community&#13;
mobilization and communications skills, the project would develop an additional resource&#13;
to assist communities in the process of managing and sustaining their ECECs more&#13;
effectively.&#13;
Training Venues&#13;
11.   DICECE will continue to carry out the residential component of the teachers' two&#13;
year in-service course in existing institutions. The MOE will formulate a policy on&#13;
rationalization of payments for residential ECEC teacher training whereby institutions&#13;
will be required to keep venue charges constant for reasonable periods and to use rates&#13;
similar to those for training equivalent cadres (e.g. primary school teachers).&#13;
Training of DICECE Staff&#13;
12.   DICECEs will need additional staff and training to meet the above&#13;
responsibilities. DICECE personnel needs are described in Annex F. DICECE staff will&#13;
require two types of training. Existing staff will need short courses in management,&#13;
communication, community mobilization skills and, in divisions where the component&#13;
will take place, on Health and Nutrition. New DICECE staff will need several kinds of&#13;
training including an induction course and orientation programs. NACECE will carry out&#13;
the nine-month induction course for the 250 additional DICECE staff expected to be&#13;
recruited during the five years of project implementation. Induction training will be at&#13;
the rate of 50 DICECE trainers per year. Some DICECE staff will also need higher&#13;
degree training locally or abroad. The DICECEs also will offer slots in training programs&#13;
such as orientation courses on early childhood development and community mobilization&#13;
skills to other officials in the district such as Community Development Officers and staff&#13;
concerned with financial management. Training curricula and materials would be&#13;
reviewed, developed and pre-tested as needed.&#13;
13.   Training needs for current and new staff at a typical DICECE and the first year's&#13;
DICECE-level curriculum development and training schedule are in the Project&#13;
Implementation Plan.&#13;
14.   Short courses need to be developed or identified locally and abroad through which&#13;
DICECE staff can get training. This would include training on management, computer&#13;
skills, specified content of ECD. If an average of two persons from each DICECE are&#13;
targeted for training each year, 500 DICECE staff would need to be reached over the&#13;
project period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex B&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
NACECE Staff Training&#13;
15.   Both existing and new NACECE staff and MOE personnel involved in early&#13;
childhood development will also require training. By Negotiations, NACECE would&#13;
develop a five-year staff development plan to guide that training effort. New NACECE&#13;
staff will receive an internally-organized orientation program of one month. Both new&#13;
and experienced NACECE staff and MOE personnel could take part in short courses of&#13;
up to six months' duration at home or abroad.&#13;
Staffing And Management&#13;
16.   For the training program to be fully operational, some existing staff positions need&#13;
to be filled and new ones created and filled. A fully operational DICECE requires a&#13;
Program Officer (PO) in charge of the institution, six trainers, an accounts clerk, and&#13;
support staff. In order to take community mobilization on a full time basis an additional&#13;
person (Community Mobilization Officer) will also be required. In some of the DICECE&#13;
that will not have enough numbers of teachers to train over five years, the full capacity&#13;
will be developed in due course. It also would develop a resource center to provide staff&#13;
and other interested professionals and communities with reference materials and up-to-&#13;
date information on best practices and developments in early childhood education.&#13;
17.   Current staffing levels at each DICECE and approved levels are shown in the&#13;
project implementation plan. It is envisaged that the approved positions will be filled&#13;
within the five year period bring the program to a full operational level.&#13;
18.   NACECE will manage the training program on behalf of overall project&#13;
management. The professional staff required for the purpose and job descriptions are&#13;
included in the project implementation plan.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
19.   The training component will be monitored both at the district and national levels.&#13;
At the district level, DICECE staff will oversee the day to day running of the program&#13;
while NACECE staff will assist on regular basis. Monitoring instruments will include&#13;
reports, surveys, and visits. An external evaluation will need to be conducted half way&#13;
through the project.&#13;
20.  Initiatives to Explore:&#13;
(a)   Pre-service training&#13;
(b)   Distance Education through radio and TV&#13;
(c)   Regional and Zonal pre-school teacher groups&#13;
(d)   Home-Based care-giver training.&#13;

COMMUNITY CAPACITY BUILDING AND MOBILIZATION&#13;
Background And Objectives&#13;
1.    More than 80% of the 20,000 ECD centers in Kenya are owned and managed by&#13;
communities. These communities have developed ECD centers according to the&#13;
perceived needs, and have been responsible for the development of physical structures,&#13;
payment of teacher salaries and training, contributions to playschool materials, school&#13;
meals. Communities are also responsible for the management of the center.&#13;
2.    Given these responsibilities, community capacity building becomes extremely&#13;
important for the delivery of quality ECD services. The success of the project is largely&#13;
dependent on how much would be achieved in mobilizing communities and building their&#13;
capacity to manage pre-schools. For long term sustainability, communities need to have&#13;
necessary skills, knowledge and decision-making capacity to manage, operate, supervise&#13;
and finance their ECD initiatives.&#13;
3.    The objectives of this component are to:&#13;
(a)   Sensitize communities on the importance and benefits of early childhood&#13;
development&#13;
(b)   Train key community leaders and managers of ECD centers (including the&#13;
preschool committees) to improve their capacity to manage pre-schools.&#13;
(c)   To mobilize communities and increase participation in ECD activities&#13;
through an IEC campaign.&#13;
Description&#13;
(a) Coverage&#13;
4.    While general community mobilization activities will be implemented all over the&#13;
country, community ECD management capacity building will be implemented&#13;
exclusively in the pilot districts. On average, there are 15 zones per district, and 30 pre-&#13;
schools per zone. Priority will be placed on communities that are chosen to implement&#13;
the project components for health and nutrition management and community grant&#13;
schemes.&#13;
(b) Orientation&#13;
5.   In order to succeed in implementing activities for community mobilization, it is&#13;
pertinent to obtain support for ECD and pre-school education from agencies involved in&#13;
providing support to ECD. NACECE would conduct a one day orientation in Nairobi for&#13;
officials and NGOs at the national level. Similarly a one day orientation session will be&#13;
conducted at the provincial level to sensitize DEOs and DDOs from the districts with an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
aim towards building team support for pre-school education through the DDCs and&#13;
DEBs. Subsequently, NACECE and DICECE would sensitize other district officials such&#13;
as the DIS (district inspectors of schools), DSDO, CDA, MOH, and MEO at the districts&#13;
in two day orientation sessions. In addition, DICECE --with cooperation from Ministry&#13;
of Culture and Social Services, DDC, and DEB -- would also sensitize and train the&#13;
divisional and zonal officials such as TAC tutors, the PSI, ZSI, AEO, and head masters&#13;
(HM) of primary schools, as well as the NGOs. This training would be held at the district&#13;
and divisional levels for 3 days for a group of 20 people or four per zone.&#13;
(c) Community Mobilization&#13;
6.    Participatory Development Approaches. The Community Mobilization Officer&#13;
(CMO) of DICECE and a ZIS (Zonal Inspectors of Schools) or HM would form a&#13;
training team both at the divisional and zonal levels. The teams would use Participatory&#13;
Development Approaches (PDA) workshops at the zonal level for a total of 60&#13;
representatives from about 4 communities for three days. The participants would be&#13;
community chiefs, ECD management committee members, PTA members, pre-school&#13;
teachers, and religious leaders. The PDA workshops would introduce the concept of a&#13;
good ECD program, and would include a needs assessment, evaluation of on-going&#13;
activities, and exchange of information related to ECD amongst the communities. The&#13;
workshop would also includes a visit to a demonstration ECD center or a community&#13;
resource center and some on-site practical exercises. At the end of the workshop, trainees&#13;
would be asked to produce a plan of action for their communities for improving their&#13;
ECD centers. The training team would review the plan and give appropriate advice on&#13;
the feasibility of the plan.&#13;
7.    Management Training. One of the major problems identified in the&#13;
administration of ECD centers is that the communities often lack adequate management&#13;
skills. Therefore, NACECE and DICECE would develop a standard training package to&#13;
enable key community members to improve the management of existing ECD centers.&#13;
The standard package would include, inter alia, the following subject areas: group&#13;
dynamics, administration, book keeping, preventive health, nutrition, growth monitoring&#13;
and promotion, inventory control, and annual planning.&#13;
8.    Training for Parents and Caregivers. Parents and caregivers play a key role in&#13;
the growth and development of the children. A program that focuses on children must&#13;
therefore also address itself to the parents and caregivers with a view to building their&#13;
capacity so that they are able to provide quality care for the young children. Here,&#13;
caregivers includes mothers, "ayahs', grandparents, and other adult childminders. The&#13;
training team for this component consists of DICECE and divisional and zonal staff who&#13;
have received the orientation training. A five-day training would be designed and&#13;
conducted for about 20 parents and caregivers at the community which will include&#13;
subjects such as: child growth and development, health and sanitation, nutrition and&#13;
proper diet, responsible parenthood, stimulation and children's learning ability,&#13;
importance of play and space, care for children with special needs, and management of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex C&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
family resources. A participatory approach will be used in order to facilitate sharing of&#13;
ideas and experiences. Activities such as development of toys and other learning&#13;
materials, collection of folk media, food production and preparation demonstrations, and&#13;
visits to relevant institutions will also be included.&#13;
9.    Community Mobilization Activities. It must be understood that the main&#13;
mobilizers of the communities have been and will continue to be the community&#13;
members themselves. Harambee meetings, Barazas, women's group meetings, PTA&#13;
meetings, school committee meetings etc., are important venues for community&#13;
mobilization activities. The project will increase the frequency and quality of existing&#13;
efforts to mobilize communities for ECD.&#13;
(d) Information, Education, and Communication (IEC)&#13;
10.   An IEC strategy will be developed and implemented with the objective of&#13;
increasing participation of the communities in ECD. Useful and easy to understand&#13;
messages would be developed on benefits of pre-school centers and health education and&#13;
feeding programs for young children. Various media would be used such as radio and&#13;
TV programs, posters, and pamphlets. Local such as the folk media could also be&#13;
facilitated by the district and zonal officials led by DICECE. This includes puppet&#13;
shows, children's plays, demonstration of games, and exhibition of children's art work at&#13;
festivals, agricultural shows, and other fares. Through these events and the folk media,&#13;
different communities could have a forum to exchange information on ECD and establish&#13;
linkages amongst each other. The target is for the district, divisional, and zonal members&#13;
to facilitate these types of events at least twice a year at the district and divisional levels.&#13;
Annual picture contests could also be organized by NACECE for the pre-school children&#13;
that would start from the zonal level and conclude at the national level.&#13;
11.   Through these IEC activities, communities with ECD centers would most likely&#13;
be able to obtain useful and important information to enhance their ability in managing&#13;
their centers. However, it is envisioned that communities which do not have ECD centers&#13;
would also be stimulated, motivated and indirectly mobilized to start their own&#13;
educational program for pre-school children.&#13;

HEALTH &amp; NUTRITION PILOT&#13;
A. Summary and Introduction&#13;
1.    The health and nutrition component would develop, test and refine a replicable&#13;
model emphasizing prevention and promotion to optimize health and nutrition standards&#13;
of pre-school children at the community level. The component would initially focus on&#13;
two target groups: &gt;3s who attend ECECs, and children 1-3 years of age who constitute&#13;
the next generation of ECEC beneficiaries. The principal interventions would be&#13;
improved caring practices and community-based health and nutrition services. Collateral&#13;
attention would go to improving growth patterns of children &lt;1 year of age through&#13;
promotion of better maternal breastfeeding and weaning practices.&#13;
2.   It is expected that families would improve their caring practices sufficiently over&#13;
the first few years of implementation for attention then to shift to older children in early&#13;
primary school, for whom other forms of service delivery would be needed.&#13;
3.    The rationale for initially centering on children &gt;1 year of age is: (a) growth&#13;
faltering tends to appear late in the first year of life, gain momentum and result in growth&#13;
failure and stunting of children at around 2 years of age, only some of which is&#13;
subsequently remediable; (b) children &lt;1 year of age have three formally scheduled&#13;
contacts with the health system through KEPI, but none thereafter, and (c) children &lt;1&#13;
year of age are generally under close family supervision which may be increasingly&#13;
diffuse thereafter as other caregivers enter the picture.&#13;
4.    The component would address the five major problems common to preschool&#13;
children throughout Kenya as well as two which are important in specific geographic&#13;
areas. The core interventions would be directed at: (i) growth failure mainly through&#13;
faulty feeding practices; (ii) diarrhea; (iii) acute respiratory infections (ARI); (iv) worms;&#13;
and (v) Vitamin A deficiencies. On a geographic basis, interventions also would include&#13;
malaria and schistosomiasis control.&#13;
5.   Interventions would have to be provided in the community because the distances&#13;
involved preclude obtaining them at other levels of service delivery.&#13;
6.    The operational unit of organization would be the division, which has around 100&#13;
pre-schools on average. The component would be implemented in 5 incremental&#13;
divisions per year, reaching a total of 2,500 ECECs. There would be a spread to cover&#13;
different ecological parts of Kenya and at least one division within each ecological zone&#13;
where child nutrition and health conditions are considered most precarious.&#13;
7.    Highest priority would go to divisions in districts with higher than average&#13;
stunting rates and lower than average ECEC coverage. Implementation for the first year&#13;
might take place in five districts where welfare monitoring data indicate that child&#13;
stunting averages over 40%: Homa Bay, Kakamega, Kilifi, Kitui and West Pokot.&#13;

B. Background&#13;
8.     Community-based interventions against each of the key problems of preschool&#13;
children, their feasibility and likely effectiveness is as follows:&#13;

9.     The interventions would emphasize promotion and prevention rather than cure.&#13;
They would aim at improving family caring practices, since it is recognized that lack of&#13;
parental knowledge and poor feeding, weaning and child care are among the principal&#13;
causes of malnutrition except in those relatively few cases where poverty is the&#13;
overwhelmingly binding constraint. Among the interventions to be promoted would be&#13;
community or family provision of a mid-day snack to ECEC children and improved&#13;
environmental sanitation (e.g. communities could use grants under that component of the&#13;
project to build latrines).&#13;
10.    Interventions against the first five problems and malaria need to be available at&#13;
least monthly (assuming Vitamin A delivery on demand as children need it rather than on&#13;
fixed semiannual dates). Both deworming and schistosomiasis prophylaxis can be&#13;
provided on a campaign basis. A Community Health Fund will be created to meet special&#13;
needs.&#13;
Delivery Options&#13;
11.    The two available mechanisms potentially capable of delivering these services at&#13;
the community level on a fully operational scale are the Ministry of Health (MOH) and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
non-government organizations (NGOs). The for-profit health sector even at village level&#13;
has found little money-making opportunity in promotional and preventive care.&#13;
12.   MOH. Except for immunization, maternal child health (MCH) services to&#13;
younger preschool children through the MOH are currently limited in scope and scale and&#13;
available on an irregular basis. In fact, rising child mortality 1988-93 in the face of rising&#13;
immunization rates indicates that overall MCH services may be declining in quality and&#13;
coverage. However, one option is to try to strengthen and expand MCH services to&#13;
provide the full range of survival and development services to preschool children. This&#13;
could be done in one or a combination of three ways.&#13;
13.   One strategy is to strengthen the availability of services at existing health facilities&#13;
to generate more consumer demand. A second is to get MOH workers to visit ECECs&#13;
routinely and frequently and also attend to the first-level health needs of the entire&#13;
community cohort of preschool children &gt;1 year of age and their parents. Government&#13;
development of a version of the Bamako initiative is a third. The Bamako approach&#13;
involves community selection of a volunteer health worker who receives some training&#13;
,in health promotion and first aid, a basic drug supply and gets to keep the profits from&#13;
drug sales to the community.&#13;
14.   Neither of the first two strategies above appears appropriate for inclusion in the&#13;
proposed project. Evidence to date indicates that the opportunity cost of beneficiary&#13;
travel to MOH facilities outweighs perceived benefits of promotional and preventive&#13;
MCH interventions, including nutrition counseling and detection of sub-acute infections.&#13;
Moreover, uneven response at fixed facilities has reduced consumer confidence in public&#13;
health services at the periphery.&#13;
15.   Getting MOH personnel to visit communities often enough and, when there, to&#13;
spend the time needed for effective MCH promotional and preventive activities also has&#13;
proven difficult. Combining community MCH work with a school or ECEC visit has&#13;
generally not been cost-effective elsewhere and does not seem to have received Kenya&#13;
priority.&#13;
16.   On balance, it appears likely that successful delivery of a community outreach&#13;
program targeted on mothers and pre-school children by present MOH personnel would&#13;
require a fairly substantial reorientation of the public health system in the geographic&#13;
areas to be covered.&#13;
17.   The Government has accepted the main principles of the Bamako initiative as part&#13;
of national health policy. Some limited MOH experiments with Bamako-type programs&#13;
have taken place. The results are reported to be generally positive. However, the MOH&#13;
has yet to develop a national strategy and program for widespread expansion of the&#13;
village-based approach. Whether under its present staffing configuration and operational&#13;
style the MOH could successfully implement a Bamako-type program on an operational&#13;
scale also remains to be determined. Moreover, the Bamako initiative focuses on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
more general health needs of the community as a whole rather than the specific&#13;
requirements of pre-school children.&#13;
18.   Non-Government Organizations (NGOs). A number of NGOs have developed&#13;
and implemented paradigms for community-based health delivery which have included&#13;
one or more parts of the service package described above. Several have also put&#13;
variations on the Bamako initiative in place both before and after its promulgation. Most&#13;
of these efforts also have been relatively small-scale and somewhat limited in scope.&#13;
However, they offer positive lessons particularly in areas of training and supervision.&#13;
C. Detailed Component Description&#13;
19.   With the above experiences and resources in mind, the component would test at&#13;
least one of the following three delivery modes in villages where the ECEC has stabilized&#13;
and an active pre-school committee (PSC) is in operation:&#13;
(a)   GOK model - Pre-school committees selects community child health&#13;
(CCH) aide. Health department at district/division level trains CH aide&#13;
(CCA) and CHW provides technical supervision on monthly basis for first&#13;
six months and as infrequently as quarterly thereafter depending on&#13;
individual performance. MOH supplies scales, growth charts, Vitamin A&#13;
capsules, deworming medication and communications materials.&#13;
(b)   NGO Model - Pre-school committees select CHW. Project contracts with&#13;
NGO such as AMREF which has experience in community health training&#13;
to train and supervise CCHA and provide logistical and material support.&#13;
20.  In each case, the division (around 100 ECECs) would be the unit of service&#13;
organization. Table 2 outlines the basic intervention delivery framework and its&#13;
relationship to problems, process and impact objectives and their indicators.&#13;
Work Routines, Supervision and Training&#13;
21.   Based on experience elsewhere, it is expected that for a population of around&#13;
1,000 persons the GMPA would need to allocate around 53 hours per month to carry out&#13;
the interventions in Table 2. Based on a population of 1,000, with around a 32 per 1,000&#13;
birth rate, initially there would be around 60 children aged 1-3 years of age and around 90&#13;
aged 3-6 years. (Estimated pre-school population growth of around 16% during the&#13;
project period has been excluded from these initial calculations.)&#13;
GMP - monthly weighing of children 1-3 years, plotting weight on growth chart and&#13;
counseling mother: 10 minutes per child, or 10 hours per month. Counseling of&#13;
pregnant women in last trimester/new mothers on lactation management, 10 contacts&#13;
of 15 minutes' duration with groups and individual women, around three hours per&#13;
month. Quarterly weighing of children 3-6 years, plotting weights and counseling&#13;
mother @ 10 minutes per child, avenge of around five hours per month.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
*  Diarrhea management - two 30-minute meetings with four groups of mothers of&#13;
children &lt;3 years of age monthly, or four hours per month.&#13;
&#149;  ARI - one hour baraza for general parent education and eight 15-minute contacts with&#13;
individual mothers, around three hours per month.&#13;
*  Skin Infections - two half-hour talks to groups of mothers, plus average of 12 scabies&#13;
cases monthly for benzyl benzoate administration at 10 minutes each with individual&#13;
counseling, around three hours per month.&#13;
*  Vitamin A - Semiannual mass dosing of 1-3 year olds, 10 per month at six minutes&#13;
each, around one hour per month.&#13;
*  Worms - Semiannual mass dosing preceded by 30-minute talk to two groups of&#13;
parents of 3-6 year old children at ECEC, three hours every six months, or 30 minutes&#13;
per month.&#13;
Malaria - Two 30-minute monthly meetings with groups of parents on malaria&#13;
prevention, recognition and control, around one hour per month.&#13;
-  Schistosomiasis - Annual 30-minute meeting with four groups of parents to prepare&#13;
for MOH administration of praziquantel, or around 10 minutes per month.&#13;
&#149;  Social marketing, spot counseling - Neighborhood visits to hand out materials,&#13;
informal doorstep counseling, etc. 30 minutes daily, or 12 hours per month.&#13;
*  Record-keeping - 30 minutes daily, or 12 hours per month.&#13;
*  Training - Supervisory interaction and in-service training, four hours per month. plus&#13;
eight hours every quarter.&#13;
22.   The CCHA could be an ECEC teacher, a traditional birth attendant, a primary&#13;
school teacher, a previously-trained community health worker, or any other reasonably&#13;
literate, numerate and credible community resident with a commitment to undertake these&#13;
activities and the time to do so. Who would supervise the CCHA depends on which of&#13;
the three delivery models operated in a particular division. However, CCHAs would&#13;
receive monthly supervision for at least the first six months after completion of training,&#13;
and no less frequently than quarterly thereafter, as well as four full days of formal in-&#13;
service training yearly. Only divisions which could assure that supervision frequency&#13;
would be eligible to take part in the component. The supervision routine would be&#13;
developed by the MOH or implementing NGO and approved by the national working&#13;
group (see below).&#13;
23.   CCHAs would receive preservice training for 45 days each in two batches of 50 at&#13;
the district level. Supervisors would receive at least ten days' full-time training; at least&#13;
three days would be joint with CCHAs from the same division. The curricula would be&#13;
approved by the national working group (see below) after development and pretesting by&#13;
either the MOH individually or in collaboration with one or more NGOs under contract.&#13;
24.   Under the MOH delivery option, the component would finance a program to train&#13;
district MOH staff to train CCHAs and supervisors in technical subjects. The community&#13;
mobilization and behavioral change aspects of the training would arranged by NACECE.&#13;
It may choose to have DICECE staff trained for that purpose by the social marketing firm&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
which would prepare communications materials. The District Medical Officer would be&#13;
required to release staff for training as trainers and subsequently to train component&#13;
personnel as required. To even out the training and management load, each district will&#13;
inaugurate the component in one division per year.&#13;
Material Support&#13;
25.   Each CCHA would receive a scale for weighing children in 1 OOg increments&#13;
which could be calibrated in the field. Scales and medications would be procured either&#13;
through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with World Bank&#13;
guidelines or through UNICEF, which the Bank recognizes as equivalent to ICB. If it&#13;
were the procurement agency, UNICEF would arrange their delivery to MOH offices at&#13;
the district level or to NGOs, depending on the service delivery mode in each district.&#13;
26.   Communications materials would be developed under contract with social&#13;
marketing consultants who also might contribute to the development of a component&#13;
communications strategy. To minimize translation and related printing complexities and&#13;
costs, emphasis would be on verbal and visual rather than written communication.&#13;
D. Component Organization and Management&#13;
27.   National Level. Overall manager of the component at national level would be the&#13;
official seconded from the MOH in the MOE office responsible for project coordination.&#13;
He or she would chair a health and nutrition working group. Its membership would&#13;
include representatives of the sections of the MOH most directly concerned with MCH,&#13;
including immunization; the community mobilization office of NACECE, and NGOs&#13;
active in providing outreach health/nutrition services at the periphery. Others with&#13;
relevant skills and experience could also be invited to join. The working group would&#13;
meet at least quarterly. It would: (a) review proposed component budgets and work&#13;
plans; (b) track physical and financial progress of the component, including monitoring&#13;
and evaluation activities; and (c) recommend ways of resolving implementation&#13;
bottlenecks. Each member would be expected to spend at least one day per quarter&#13;
observing component activities in the field.&#13;
28.   District Level. The District ECD Implementation Committee would oversee the&#13;
component at district level and assure coordination among the agencies involved. The&#13;
main tasks at the district level would be to work with division staff to formulate a&#13;
division work plan and budget, to ensure timely implementation and proper monitoring&#13;
and to resolve local operational issues.&#13;
29.   Division Level. DICECE program officers decentralized to the division level&#13;
would have an oversight responsibility in regard to community mobilization for health&#13;
and nutrition activities in pilot project areas. As part of their ECEC supervision, they&#13;
would be expected to review levels of community participation in the health and nutrition&#13;
problem and act as an early warning system for major demand-supply service gaps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
30.   Community Level. Before introducing the pilot program, a plan for introducing&#13;
these services to the community needs to be formulated and carried out. The purpose of&#13;
the plan is to ensure as good a fit as possible between services available through the&#13;
project and the community's priorities and perceptions. By sensitizing both the&#13;
community and service providers in advance, a more favorable implementation climate&#13;
hopefully will emerge.&#13;
31.   At each of these levels, a series of health management committees have already&#13;
been constituted by the MOH for primary health care. These committees will coordinate&#13;
with the ECD Committees in the planning, supervision and monitoring of health activities&#13;
in ECD centers and the communities. The health coordinators at each level will facilitate&#13;
this process.&#13;

ECD COMMUNITY GRANTS SUPPORT COMPONENT&#13;
A. Background And Objectives&#13;
1.    The objectives of this component are:&#13;
(a)   to assist the most needy communities in developing financially viable and&#13;
sustainable ECD services.&#13;
(b)   to assist the most needy preschool children to access ECD services.&#13;
2.    Experience in the last decade indicates that thousands of Kenyan communities are&#13;
interested in the development of ECD services and parents have been willing to provide&#13;
their own share by the providing land, school building and paying fees for operating&#13;
expenditures. However, most of the community/parent-managed ECD centers are&#13;
constrained by low levels of funding. The WB (1995) series of studies on early child&#13;
development show that these community owned and managed early child development&#13;
centers (ECD) rely almost exclusively on parents' fee contributions for its operating and&#13;
maintenance costs, and virtually no direct contributions from government. These centers&#13;
lack sustainable financing since fees are not enough nor are collected regularly and&#13;
therefore are not sufficient to pay for recurrent costs such as pay for the preschool&#13;
teacher/provider, or learning materials, maintenance of facilities or for feeding or health&#13;
services.&#13;
3.    This pilot financing mechanism is intended to test and learn from these pilots&#13;
alternative methods of making these ECD centers financially viable and sustainable over&#13;
the long term . A financing mechanism using trust funds will be tested in&#13;
community/parent-managed ECD centers.&#13;
B. Description Of The Proposed Financing Mechanism&#13;
4.    Overview of Mechanics for the Grants. This pilot will set up an ECD Trust&#13;
Fund for each pre-school in order to provide the school with a steady income stream to&#13;
meet monthly recurrent costs. In order for an ECD center to qualify for the fund, the&#13;
community must initially collect an amount for an ECD Fund. The project will then&#13;
provide a grant which will be added to the ECD Trust Fund account. The minimum&#13;
amount eligible for a grant will be six months operating costs of the center. The&#13;
maximum amount that will be matched over the four years of the project will be KSh&#13;
100,000. The ECD Fund will be held where applicable in a protected interest bearing trust&#13;
account in the nearest approved bank with three signatories designated by the ECD&#13;
Committee (including the chairperson and the treasurer). The Fund can be used to pay&#13;
for eligible expenditures (such as augmenting teachers salaries, learning materials, school&#13;
improvements, bursaries and school health and nutrition). Every month the pre-school&#13;
committee will deposit the fees collected and make withdrawals against pre-approved&#13;
budget for eligible expenditures which must be submitted together with the withdrawal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
request. Every quarter, the statements of expenditure will be sent to DICECE/NGO with&#13;
the monthly budgets attached for accounting and auditing purposes.&#13;
5.    The community would be able to fund a significant proportion of the operating&#13;
expenses of the ECD center. Parents will continue to pay school fees and any savings can&#13;
be used to periodically increase the capital fund. The community will be encouraged to&#13;
further build up the fund by harambee since inflation is likely to eat up the capital if no&#13;
new funds are added or if school fees is not consistently collected.&#13;
6.    This financing mechanism is intended to make the center financially self-&#13;
sustainable beginning in the third year of the project. The purpose of the piloting is to&#13;
understand and learn from the experience. Technical assistance in self-management,&#13;
accounting, fund raising (by income generating activities), planning and budgeting will&#13;
be provided by the community mobilization and capacity building component of the&#13;
project.&#13;
7.    Eligibility Criteria for the Centers. In order for an ECD center to qualify for&#13;
the matching grant, the following eligibility criteria will be applied:&#13;
(a)   The preschool must be community/parent managed.&#13;
(b)   Current (1995) fee per child charged by the preschool should be less than&#13;
K Shillings 3,000 per year. (Reason: preschools charging fees higher than&#13;
this amount are likely to be adequately funded)&#13;
(c)   The center must have an organized preschool committee--at least with a&#13;
chairman, secretary and treasurer--and meet regularly.&#13;
(d)   The center committee members must have undergone training in&#13;
bookkeeping, banking, planning and budgeting.&#13;
(e)   The center must have a bank account, where applicable, with three&#13;
signatories.&#13;
(f)    The center must have a certified record of school attendance, list of pupils&#13;
and information regarding these pupils.&#13;
(g)   The center budget must be affixed on the premises and must be approved&#13;
by the committee.&#13;
C. Criteria for Selection of Pilot Project Areas&#13;
8.    Since the pilot project is intended to test both the technical and administrative&#13;
feasibility of grants, the pilot areas will be selected based on criteria that will allow for a&#13;
systematic evaluation of its impact on children and success (or failure) in administrative&#13;
procedures. The selection should allow for testing of the matching grant administration&#13;
in difficult areas as well as in areas with good administrative infrastructure.&#13;
9.    For purposes of this pilot project, a total of 2,000 preschools will be selected in 14&#13;
districts. The final selection of districts and divisions within these districts will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex E&#13;

determined by MOE using pre-determined criteria and after considering the availability&#13;
of other ECD programs currently sponsored by other donors.&#13;
D. Phasing Of Pilot Project&#13;
10.   The grants pilots will be introduced in the second year up to the fourth year of the&#13;
project. During the first year, the administrative procedures will be firmed up by MOE&#13;
and the selection of the project areas will be determined. During the first year, the&#13;
community mobilization and capacity building is expected to be conducted in the pilot&#13;
areas. This includes the organization/strengthening of the preschool committees, training&#13;
in accounting, management, procurement and banking of key members of the committee,&#13;
and preparing the preschool for the pilot grants. It is also expected that the preschool&#13;
teacher will be given training/orientation, or enrollment in the training courses.&#13;
E. Administrative Procedures&#13;
11.   Grants will be allocated to preschools under the following procedures:&#13;
(a)   Selection of Pilot Areas. Pilot districts and divisions will be selected&#13;
using the above criteria. The selection process will be designed to afford&#13;
maximum transparency and impartiality.&#13;
(b)   Awareness Campaign. News and information of the availability of the&#13;
matching grants will be disseminated throughout the pilot areas.&#13;
(c)   Submission of Grant Application and Certification of Grant Award.&#13;
Applications will be received from the selected divisions. Based on&#13;
criteria for eligibility, the center that will be awarded the grants will be&#13;
notified.&#13;
(d)   Letter of Agreement. After selection of the center, a Letter of&#13;
Agreement will be signed by the NGO/MOE and the Chairperson of the&#13;
ECD Center Committee specifying the terms and conditions of the grant.&#13;
(e)   Disbursement of Grants. Grants will be disbursed into the bank account-&#13;
-a protected Trust Fund-- of the ECD center. The project will disburse the&#13;
grant up to a ceiling of K Shillings 100,000 unless otherwise agreed.&#13;
(f)   Report of Quarterly Statements. Quarterly SOEs will be the basis for&#13;
monitoring the use of the grant, and for evaluating the benefits accruing to&#13;
the receiving ECD centers, and identifying measures to be taken to in&#13;
December, the second in March and the third in July of each year.&#13;
(g)   Auditing. Random audits will be conducted against records maintained&#13;
by the ECD center to verify utilization of the grant.&#13;

PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION&#13;
Overall Project Management and Coordination&#13;
1.    The National Steering Committee. The project will receive overall policy and&#13;
strategic direction from a national, intersectoral ECD Implementation Committee&#13;
(NECDIC) chaired by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education. Members of the&#13;
committee would include the Director of Education, the Chief Inspector of Schools, the&#13;
Senior Deputy Director in charge of Primary Education, the Director of the Kenya&#13;
Institute of Education, the Coordinator of NACECE; the Secretary, Teachers' Service&#13;
Commission, a senior official each from the Ministries of Finance, Health, Culture &amp;&#13;
Social Services, Local Government and Home Affairs, representatives of NGOs and&#13;
nominated experts. The Project Coordinator (see below) would be the Secretary to the&#13;
Committee. The committee would meet at least once a quarter to discuss and approve&#13;
project work plans and budgets, ensure prompt deployment of funds for project activities,&#13;
review project progress and impact and discuss policy issues arising from the&#13;
implementation of the project. The constitution of the NECDIC is a condition for Board&#13;
presentation and assurances will be sought for the maintenance of the committee during&#13;
the project.&#13;
2.    The ECD Section of the Directorate Division of MOE. The ECD section of the&#13;
Ministry of Education will be strengthened and the head, whose qualifications and&#13;
experience will be satisfactory to IDA, will be named Project Coordinator. The Project&#13;
Coordinator will (a) be the Secretary of the ECD Implementation Committee (b) facilitate&#13;
project coordination and implementation and monitor project progress and (c) handle&#13;
IDA's administrative requirements. The ECD section will be strengthened with four new&#13;
professional positions for Monitoring and Evaluation, Health and Nutrition and&#13;
Community Development and Accounting and two support staff. Responsibilities of the&#13;
unit include the preparation of annual work plans in accordance with the Project&#13;
Implementation manual, monitoring of project activities and project finances and&#13;
accounting. The PE would be responsible for managing the information data base and&#13;
conducting analysis of implementation and procurement. Assurances will be sought at&#13;
negotiations for the nomination of a Project Coordinator satisfactory to IDA during the&#13;
project.&#13;
3.    NACECE. The functions of NACECE are being reviewed and the institution&#13;
strengthened to carry out its overall innovation and quality assurance roles. Existing&#13;
positions include 12 professional staff in 6 sections responsible for training, curriculum,&#13;
human growth and development, research and evaluation, resources management and&#13;
community and parental education respectively. The institution is managed by a&#13;
Coordinator and a Deputy Coordinator. Job descriptions of existing staff will be&#13;
redefined and a staff development plan prepared. The filling up of key vacancies will be&#13;
a condition of Board Presentation. NACECE will be provided with necessary equipment&#13;
and supplies including desk top publishing facilities and tools for making play materials&#13;
and the library will be strengthened. NACECE's establishment will be strengthened per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex F&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
existing proposals under consideration of KIE. Funds have been allocated for specialist&#13;
technical assistance for project related activities.&#13;
The District Level&#13;
4.    The District Steering Committee. An intersectoral District ECD&#13;
Implementation Committee (DECDIC) will be constituted at the district level which&#13;
would meet on a monthly basis. The Committee would be chaired by the District&#13;
Education Officer and the Program Officer, DICECE will be the Secretary. Other&#13;
members would include representatives from the Ministries of Health, Culture and Social&#13;
Services, Local Governments and NGOs working in the district.&#13;
5.    DICECE. At the district level, the DICECE will facilitate a consortium of all&#13;
actors involved in the delivery and promotion of ECD services. The DDC and the DEB&#13;
will be used to discuss ECD issues and coordinate resources. The current DICECE&#13;
staffing pattern consists of 6 professionals each in 20 fully fledged DICECEs (those that&#13;
offer residential training) and 4 professionals each in 31 associate DICECEs. However&#13;
only 168 of the 292 positions are currently filled. Under the project, the recommendation&#13;
of the management study undertaken as part of project preparation, to decentralize the&#13;
DICECE staff to the divisional level will be piloted. DICECEs will be staffed up to the&#13;
full existing establishment of 6 trainers and staff strength will be increased to 8 in some&#13;
DICECEs by the end of the project. This will involve the filling up of vacant positions&#13;
(for which the process has been initiated by the Teachers Service Commission), and the&#13;
establishment of essential new positions during the course of the project. DICECE&#13;
positions include a Program Officer in the grade of Senior Lecturer, a Community&#13;
Mobilization Officer and Training Specialist in the grade of Lecturer, and a data analyst.&#13;
A pilot program specialist will be included for each pilot district. The professional staff&#13;
will be supported by a bookkeeper, typist and general helper. The DICECEs will be&#13;
strengthened with necessary equipment and supplies such as computers, audio-visual&#13;
equipment and duplicating machines. Means to improve mobility will be provided. As&#13;
an initial exercise, the DICECE will map ECD facilities in each district, identify all the&#13;
entities providing ECD services including local governments and the private sector,&#13;
identify gaps and areas that are not being served. Annual district plans will be based on&#13;
the baseline information and the decisions of the DDC and DEBs.&#13;
The Community Level&#13;
6.    Pre-school Committees. At the community level, pre-school committees would&#13;
have the principal responsibility for the management of the ECD centers and would be&#13;
trained for the purpose. Those pre-schools that are attached to primary schools and&#13;
managed by statutory pre-school committees, will expand their committees to include the&#13;
pre-school teacher and representatives of parents of pre-school children. Terms of&#13;
reference and composition of these committees are elaborated in the Project&#13;
Implementation Plan. Stand alone pre-schools will be managed by community&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex F&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
committees. These committees would receive training and technical assistance to&#13;
improve their managerial capabilities (see Annex C).&#13;
Supervision&#13;
7.    Strengthening both the quality and the amount of supervision of ECD teaching&#13;
and management practices is an important means that the project will use to improve the&#13;
quality of the centers. Currently, most ECD teachers and committees receive&#13;
considerably less technical guidance than they need. Partly this is because the ECD&#13;
program has expanded so quickly and into even difficult-to-access areas. The sample&#13;
survey conducted as part of project preparation showed that headmasters of primary&#13;
schools attached or linked to pre-schools often provide some supervision. Local&#13;
government sponsored centers are supervised by pre-school supervisors employed by&#13;
local governments. Assistant Inspectors of Schools at the zonal level also visit pre-&#13;
schools attached to primary schools. However, supervisory visits to the majority of ECD&#13;
centers tend to be irregular and even less frequent than once every 90 days, although&#13;
monthly technical supervision particularly of untrained preschool teachers would be a&#13;
more appropriate norm. The lack of a supervision strategy, standards, work routines and&#13;
training affects the quality of whatever supervisory interaction takes place.&#13;
8.    The project would seek to make supervision a more effective tool for improved&#13;
program performance in three ways. First, it would finance the cost of establishing&#13;
supervision protocols which emphasize supervision as an opportunity for problem solving&#13;
and in-service training for ECD teachers rather than as mainly an inspection function.&#13;
Second, the project would finance the training of supervisors in the application of the new&#13;
approach to supervision. Third, by a combination of redeploying and augmenting&#13;
DICECE staff, and training headmasters and primary school inspectors in the supportive&#13;
supervision of pre-schools, the project would raise the frequency, regularity and quality&#13;
of supervision to more satisfactory levels.&#13;
9.    The Inspectorate MOE would be responsible for formulating the new supervision&#13;
standards and work methodology. The protocols would derive from a careful analysis of&#13;
the main performance weaknesses. They would take into account the wide variations in&#13;
educational background and previous experience of ECD teachers as well as the&#13;
difference in professional skills between the 70% who remain untrained and those who&#13;
have completed the pre-service training course. The InspectoratelNACECE also would&#13;
develop and organize training programs to speed the effective adoption of the improved&#13;
approach to supervision.&#13;
10.   The project would test three ways of increasing the frequency, duration and&#13;
effectiveness of ECD teacher supervision. The first innovation would be to increase and&#13;
decentralize DICECE staff to the divisions. Under this option, one DICECE officer in&#13;
the grade of Assistant Lecturer would be assigned at the division level for every 50&#13;
preschools (approximately two officers per division). This ratio would permit one&#13;
supervisory visit to each pre-school every three months. While this is far less than&#13;
desirable, the use of program officers may improve the quality of supervision and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex F&#13;
Page 4 of 6&#13;
stationing them closer to the preschools should increase the supervisory time per visit.&#13;
The core DICECE staff at district level under that scenario would consist of four&#13;
professionals. Divisional DICECE staff would be brought to the district level as needed&#13;
to help teach the residential DICECE pre-service courses for untrained preschool&#13;
teachers. DICECE staff will be provided motorcycles.&#13;
11.   Secondly, the zonal inspectors of schools (ZIS) at the subdivision or zonal level&#13;
will be trained in pre-school supervision and their job descriptions revised to include the&#13;
supervision of pre-schools. The number of ZIS per division would be increased to enable&#13;
them to have a reasonable workload in view of the additional responsibility for about 30&#13;
pre-schools per ZIS. The divisional DICECE officer would supervise and provide in-&#13;
service training to the ZIS and would make regular spot visits to weak centers. Control&#13;
mechanisms will be put in place to ensure proper utilization of vehicles.&#13;
12.   Thirdly, the project would create formal supervisory linkages between head&#13;
teachers of primary school and neighboring ECD centers. Around 40% of centers already&#13;
are either attached or in some way linked to a primary school. Mapping school locations&#13;
would result in clusters of around five preschools for which head teachers would have&#13;
supervisory responsibility. The DICECE would train head teachers in supervision&#13;
methodology and practices. Head teachers would make monthly supervisory visit to each&#13;
ECD teacher in the particular cluster. Bicycles will be made available for purposes of&#13;
inspection.&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
13.   Core components. NACECE will be responsible for implementing the core&#13;
components of Improved Teacher Performance/Training and Community&#13;
Mobilization/IEC. Two implementation models will be tested under the Community&#13;
Trust Funds/Support Grants and Health and Nutrition components. In the first model,&#13;
lead NGOs will be selected to implement the pilots in selected districts subject to&#13;
approval of work plans and budgets by the NECDIC and DECDICs. The NGOs will&#13;
support community based organizations in grassroots implementation. Criteria for&#13;
selection of national NGOs includes an established working relationship with GOK,&#13;
experience in ECD, financial management capacity and the contribution of counterpart&#13;
funds to cover overhead/administrative costs and project activities. In the second model,&#13;
the GOK will implement the pilot component with collaborating agencies at the district&#13;
level. Funds would flow directly to the districts where they would be disbursed&#13;
according to work plans approved by DECDICs and the NECDIC. The Transition Pilot&#13;
will be implemented by the MOE Inspectorate and KIE.&#13;
Project Implementation Manual&#13;
14.   A draft Project Implementation Manual (PIM) was submitted to IDA on April 1,&#13;
1996. The Manual lists the districts targeted for implementation of the pilot activities and&#13;
the criteria for their selection. To facilitate the process, a ranking of districts on the basis&#13;
of composite income, nutrition and education indicators has been prepared. On the basis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex F&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
of these indicators, the GOK has made a preliminary selection of 24 districts for the&#13;
implementation of the pilot components. The further selection of districts for the&#13;
implementation of each pilot will be made on the basis of on-going activities in the&#13;
districts. The selection of NGO led and GOK led districts, similarly, will be based on the&#13;
extent and nature of NGO presence in selected districts. Each district will have one type&#13;
of pilot activity and leadership provided by GOK or an NGO in a district will be mutually&#13;
exclusive. Implementation of the pilots at the community level is not expected to begin&#13;
before a full year of preparation including the selection of NGOs and training. The PIM&#13;
lists the activities under each component, persons responsible, time table and costs. The&#13;
Manual also provides job descriptions, qualifications, recruitment timetables and work&#13;
routines for key positions at various levels.&#13;
15.   Annual project plans for each fiscal year (July to June) will be submitted to IDA&#13;
in January of each year, following a joint review of project implementation. A mid-term&#13;
review of the project will be held in February 1999. The results of the evaluation,&#13;
particularly of the pilots, will be used for purposes of structured learning and any&#13;
necessary adjustments in project design and implementation.&#13;

MONITORING AND EVALUATION COMPONENT&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
1.    The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) component would have three goals: first,&#13;
to track the supply of ECD and other inputs in the project; second, to monitor project&#13;
outcomes, such as increased participation, especially by disadvantaged groups, in ECD&#13;
centers and improved quality of ECD services; and finally, to evaluate the impact of the&#13;
project and its components, wherever possible, on measures of child outcomes, such as&#13;
the cognitive, social and physical development of children.&#13;
B. Framework and Indicators&#13;
2.    The impact on child outcomes of ECD services provided by the project can best&#13;
be viewed as a series of production processes involving different inputs and outputs. The&#13;
ultimate output of this process is the cognitive, social and physical development of the&#13;
child. Among the many inputs determining this outcome are the (unobserved) innate&#13;
ability of the child, socioeconomic status of the family, the environment of the&#13;
community in which the child resides, and the 'output' of ECD services.&#13;
3.    The latter is itself 'produced' by various ECD inputs, such as teaching staff, care&#13;
givers, home facilities, school and classroom facilities, learning materials, and&#13;
community involvement, among other things. The project and its components thus&#13;
represent the first stage of inputs into the 'production' of child development.&#13;
Intermediate outputs of the project would include the total number of children, as well as&#13;
the number of children from underprivileged family backgrounds, participating in ECD&#13;
centers and the quality of ECD services being provided.&#13;
4.    Each set of inputs and outputs in the production process is measurable by various&#13;
indicators. For instance, project inputs can be measured by the amount of funds spent on&#13;
different components, the number of teachers or care givers trained, and the number and&#13;
type of school feeding programs operated. An illustrative list of project output indicators&#13;
would include increased enrollment rates (aggregate and separately for each gender and&#13;
for different age and spatial groups); increased availability of ECD services for children&#13;
from low-income backgrounds; improved quality of learning materials and classroom&#13;
facilities; increased levels of community and parental participation in ECD activities; and&#13;
more comprehensive coverage of immunization and feeding programs.&#13;
5.    Non-project inputs into child quality can be divided into three categories: child-&#13;
level factors (such as age, sex and birth order); household-level variables (such as&#13;
household size, parental age, occupation, education, and family income); and community-&#13;
level variables (such as the availability and quality of existing school and health&#13;
infrastructure).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
6.    Finally, sample indicators of child outcomes would include, inter alia, letter and&#13;
word recognition, language and arithmetic skills, reading skills, and intelligence-test&#13;
scores (cognitive development); age of entry into primary school and grade progression in&#13;
primary school (primary school readiness); weight, height, and sensory motor skills&#13;
(physical development); and peer group interaction and classroom participation (social&#13;
development).&#13;
C. Detailed Description of the Monitoring Component&#13;
(a) Nature of data to be collected&#13;
7.    The existing MOE and DICECE staff at the district, divisional, and zonal levels&#13;
will be used for monitoring purposes. These include the DEO, EO, School Inspectors,&#13;
AEO, ZIS, TACT, and the ECD Officer. In addition, to ensure data reliability and&#13;
utilization of data by final users, it is proposed that most of the monitoring data at the&#13;
center level be collected by preschool teachers and head teachers.&#13;
8.    At the ECD center, monitoring data would be collected by means of three&#13;
instruments: child cards, center registers and wallcharts, and a survey of ECD centers.&#13;
9.    Child Card. Every center would be required to maintain a register. One copy of&#13;
the card would be kept at the center, and another copy would be kept by the child's&#13;
mother. The child card would consolidate information already being collected in the&#13;
admission and attendance records that are maintained by most preschools. In addition to&#13;
basic identification details (such as name, parents' names, address,&#13;
village/zone/division/district of residence, etc.), information would be collected on the&#13;
child's characteristics (viz., age, sex, birth order in the family, type of disability, if any,&#13;
and place of birth) and family background (e.g., parents' occupation, age and education).&#13;
10.   The child card would also include a running health and immunization record that&#13;
would note the dates and results of anthropometic measurements and immunizations&#13;
received by a child. In addition, a running attendance record would note the number of&#13;
days in each month that the child was absent from the center for reasons of ill health,&#13;
nonpayment of fees, or other factors. Finally, an assessment record would note the dates&#13;
and results of any cognitive or social assessments or tests performed on the child.&#13;
11.   Center Register and Wall Chart. In addition, each center would maintain a&#13;
preprinted register and wallchart where aggregated information from the child cards and&#13;
on the center worker's performance would be noted monthly. The center register would&#13;
contain data on no more than 15 monitoring indicators, while the wallchart would report&#13;
even fewer -- say, 8 -- indicators. Examples of these indicators are: center attendance&#13;
rate during the preceding month, number of children immunized, supervisory visits to the&#13;
center, and time spent by the center worker in major activities (e.g., stimulation, teaching,&#13;
health and nutrition, counseling, training, etc.). The wallchart would be put up in a&#13;
location for maximum visibility. It would be erasable, so that the information on it could&#13;
be readily erased and updated each month.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
12.   Survey of Centers. A one-time sample survey of centers participating in the&#13;
project would be undertaken at the time of project initiation. The survey would be&#13;
updated annually to note any changes taking place over the course of the year. A 10%&#13;
probability sample of all centers participating in the project will yield a sufficiently large&#13;
sample size to provide representative monitoring data. This sample will have to be&#13;
stratified by geographical region as well as by project component for retaining&#13;
representativeness.&#13;
13.   The information to be reported would be similar to that covered in the 1994&#13;
Survey of ECD Centers. (Indeed, the same sample of centers selected for the 1994 survey&#13;
could be used.) Briefly, it would include the center's name, address, registration number&#13;
(if any), sponsorship, and the type of attachment (if any) of the center to a primary&#13;
school. In addition, information would be collected on the physical facilities of the center&#13;
(viz., number of rooms in the home, type of classrooms; and numbers of functioning&#13;
toilets, desks, blackboards, water fountains, and play fields). Data would also be obtained&#13;
on the number of school committee and PTA meetings; frequency and coverage of&#13;
school-wide medical and nutritional interventions, such as deworming, growth&#13;
monitoring, and vitamin A supplementation; and frequency and type of school feeding&#13;
programs. In addition, the survey would note the dates and types of specific project&#13;
interventions.&#13;
14.   Finally, the survey would obtain detailed information on each staff member,&#13;
including his/her function (e.g., child care, whether teaching, administration, etc.); date&#13;
and manner of recruitment in the center; initial academic and professional qualifications&#13;
at the time of recruitment; the date, type and duration of any additional training obtained&#13;
while employed at the center; and the value of salary and other benefits received.&#13;
(b) Frequency of Data Collection&#13;
15.   Child cards would be updated continuously, and would contain precise dates of&#13;
events (such as immunizations). For example, information on a child's family&#13;
background would be collected only once, either upon the child's admission in an ECD&#13;
center or at the time of the center's induction into the project (for children already&#13;
enrolled in the center). Likewise, whenever a child would be weighed, his/her weight&#13;
would be recorded, along with the date of the measurement, on the child card. Center&#13;
registers and wallcharts would be updated on a monthly basis. The baseline sample&#13;
survey of ECD centers would be undertaken at the time of project initiation, and updated&#13;
for any changes each year.&#13;
(c) Selection of ECD Centers&#13;
16.   Child cards would be maintained by all centers participating in the project. The&#13;
survey of centers would be administered to approximately 10% of all centers participating&#13;
in any component of the project. Centers will be selected for inclusion in the survey on&#13;
the basis of several criteria, including geographic location, socioeconomic status, and&#13;
participation in various components of the project. A certain number of centers will be&#13;
surveyed in the first year even though the project might not be phased in these centers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
Page 4 of 10&#13;
until a later period. These centers would provide a matched control group in years one&#13;
and two of the project, thus permitting comparison of process outcomes in communities&#13;
exposed and not exposed to the project intervention.&#13;
(d) Who would collect the data?&#13;
17.   Community Health Workers and Head teachers at the ECD center would be&#13;
responsible for maintaining child cards for each of their pupils. Center registers and&#13;
wallcharts would be maintained by the head teacher or other center workers. The survey&#13;
of centers would be undertaken by a team comprised of technical consultants, MOE staff&#13;
and staff from the Central Bureau of Statistics.&#13;
(e) Transmission and Use of Monitoring Data (Management Information System)&#13;
18.   Each quarter, the ECD officer or DICECE officer-in-charge would collect&#13;
information from the child cards, center registers and center wallcharts in each of the&#13;
centers in his/her area, and bring it to the DICECE office. The information would be&#13;
entered in a computerized database at the DICECE office. (In DICECE offices that do&#13;
not have electricity or computers, the information would be entered manually on a coding&#13;
sheet.) Periodically - say, every quarter - the DICECE office would transmit the&#13;
information electronically - or manually in the case of offices not having computers,&#13;
telephones or fax/modems - to the PPE section in the MOE, which would maintain a&#13;
national database of ECD-enrolled children and ECD centers.&#13;
19.   There would be several ways in which the management information system (MIS)&#13;
could be used for district planning purposes. First, trends in enrollments, by age group,&#13;
socioeconomic group, and gender, could be calculated for the entire district as well as&#13;
zones within the district. This would indicate progress that the district and its divisions&#13;
were making in expanding access to and improving equity in the provision of ECD&#13;
services. Likewise, trends in immunization rates, anthropometric indicators, and child&#13;
assessment indicators would provide important evidence on the progress (and&#13;
weaknesses) of the project in specific areas. Comparisons of enrollment rates and other&#13;
indicators across centers participating in various components of the project and those not&#13;
participating in these components, with appropriate controls for other variables, would&#13;
indicate the marginal effects of different project components on project outcomes.&#13;
20.   Second, a system would be set in place whereby the DICECE officer would&#13;
supply certain aggregated information and profiles back to each of the centers in the&#13;
district. For instance, centers would receive information on how their enrollment trends,&#13;
nutritional status indicators or community mobilization efforts compared against other&#13;
centers in the district. The pointing out of specific areas of weaknesses and strengths to&#13;
each center would permit centers to deploy their resources differently or to target their&#13;
ECD services more narrowly to specific age, sex or socioeconomic groups. This is an&#13;
extremely important aspect of the monitoring component, and one whose importance&#13;
cannot be overemphasized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;

21.   Third, the national database would be helpful in evaluating the impact of specific&#13;
project inputs on project outcomes, like national enrollments, teacher quality, and&#13;
participation in ECD by low-income groups. The monitoring data would also supplement&#13;
the mid-term and post-project impact evaluation to be undertaken. To the extent that&#13;
some centers reporting monitoring data would be ones where the project components&#13;
would only be phased in later, one would have a control group of centers not (yet)&#13;
exposed to project intervention.&#13;
D. Detailed Description of the Evaluation Component&#13;
22.   The evaluation component differs from the monitoring component in that it will&#13;
deal with the impact of the project on child outcomes. For a proper evaluation exercise,&#13;
children not exposed to project intervention will be needed as a control (comparison)&#13;
group. This in turn implies that ECD center-based data are not sufficient for evaluating&#13;
the impact of ECD services on child outcomes; the data would have to come from a&#13;
general survey of households, some of whose children have been exposed to ECD&#13;
services and others not.&#13;
23.   The evaluation component will consist of a baseline survey of households to be&#13;
undertaken around the time of project initiation (January - July 1997). The sampling&#13;
design will have to be developed so as to ensure inclusion of control households that will&#13;
not have access to project-supported ECD centers as well as sufficient coverage of&#13;
households exposed to different project components. In addition, the sample will need to&#13;
include a sufficient number of children of different ages in each of the project&#13;
intervention and control groups to undertake cohort-specific analysis. A sample of 5,000&#13;
households may need to be fielded, of which approximately one-half will be drawn from&#13;
the catchment areas of ECD centers participating in the project. The selection of&#13;
communities for surveying will require planning as treatment groups will have to be&#13;
matched to control groups on the basis of socioeconomic, demographic and&#13;
infrastructural characteristics.&#13;
24.   Because the cognitive, social and physical development of children is determined&#13;
by much more than ECD program intervention, the household survey will have to be a&#13;
general-purpose one that obtains information on a wide range of individual-, household-,&#13;
and community-level variables. Because cognitive and social development are important&#13;
outcomes that may be influenced by early childhood education, the baseline survey will&#13;
include well-established psychological tests of cognitive achievement, intelligence, and&#13;
social interaction (administered to, say, a subset of sample children).&#13;
25.   The same households will be resurveyed for a mid-term evaluation in year three&#13;
(January 1999) of the project and once again for the final evaluation at the end of year&#13;
five (viz., January 2001). The repeat surveys will obtain broadly similar data as the&#13;
baseline survey.&#13;
26.   Because of the large size of the data sets generated from the longitudinal&#13;
evaluation surveys and the complex nature of the methodology involved in proper&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
evaluation work, the impact evaluation will need to be undertaken by a group of technical&#13;
consultants and staff from the Central Bureau of Statistics that are familiar with large-&#13;
scale data collection and analysis. This group will work in close collaboration with&#13;
NACECE and the MOE at all stages of the evaluation - survey design, data collection,&#13;
and data analysis. Indeed, since the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) is proposing to&#13;
field a national Welfare Monitoring Survey of Households annually, the project might not&#13;
even need to conduct separate evaluation surveys. With (a) minor modifications,&#13;
including an additional module, to the basic WMS questionnaire, (b) better coordination&#13;
on timing of the surveys with the CBS, and (c) additional purposive over-sampling of&#13;
households in project intervention regions, it might be possible to use the proposed WM&#13;
surveys as the baseline, midterm and post-project evaluation surveys" This will result in&#13;
considerable costs savings.&#13;
E. Detailed Description of Special Studies&#13;
27.  In addition to the monitoring and evaluation exercises described above, there will&#13;
be a need for special studies that: (a) address policy development issues; (b) deal with&#13;
operational research issues; and (c) evaluate anv specific issues or problems not covered&#13;
by the regular M&amp;E activities (e.g., training and supervision). For example, monitoring&#13;
data from the child cards, center registers and wallcharts, and the survey of centers will&#13;
provide quantitative information on project outcomes. They will not permit monitoring&#13;
qualitative changes taking place among parents and communities in behavior and&#13;
attitudes, as well as monitoring such things as the effectiveness and appropriateness of&#13;
curriculum changes as perceived by teachers. For this reason, it would be important to&#13;
supplement the quantitative data on monitoring with qualitative information obtained&#13;
from small focus group discussions with teachers, parents and communities. These could&#13;
be the basis of a special study.&#13;
28.   Another set of special studies would focus on evaluation of specific project&#13;
components. For instance, the issue of which package of health and nutritional&#13;
interventions -- immunization, Vitamin A supplementation, deworming -- is the most&#13;
cost-effective is one that calls for a more focused evaluation. Likewise, the most&#13;
effective mode of delivery in the community mobilization component is an operational&#13;
research issue that is best addressed by a special study devoted entirely to this question.&#13;
29.   Not all of the special studies that need to be undertaken can be described in&#13;
advance; the need for some of them might be felt during the course of the project.&#13;
F. Organization and Management&#13;
30.   At the national level, the overall manager of the component would be the head of&#13;
the Research and Evaluation group within the MOE. He or she would chair an M&amp;E&#13;
working group, whose membership would include representatives from the Ministry of&#13;
Education, Ministry of Health, Central Bureau of Statistics, NGOs active in ECD and&#13;
technical consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex G&#13;
Page 7 of 10&#13;
31.   At the district level, a steering committee for M&amp;E would be established under&#13;
the chairmanship of the DEO, and would include the District Statistics Officer, EO,&#13;
School Inspectors, AEO, ASI, TACT, the ECD Officer, and representatives of parents'&#13;
committees, teachers' committees, and NGOs. This committee would oversee all M&amp;E&#13;
activities in the district. The District Statistics Officer (DSO) would be an important&#13;
player in this activity, since he/she currently is responsible for collection and&#13;
management of all data at the district level. However, in practice, most DSOs, who are&#13;
education officers, allocate their time to several non-data-related activities. For the DSOs&#13;
to be the chief M&amp;E persons in a district, they would have to be released from their other&#13;
duties by the DEO.&#13;
32.   In addition to data collection, management and analysis, the responsibilities of the&#13;
DSO will include dissemination of monitoring information to the District Education&#13;
Board and the District Development Committee and to the division people.&#13;
G. Training and Equipment&#13;
33.   Currently, all preprimary school data are compiled and analyzed manually. A&#13;
computerized management information system (MIS) will be an absolute necessity for&#13;
using large amounts of monitoring data to make quick and appropriate planning decisions&#13;
at the center, district and national level. Computers equipped with fax/data modems are,&#13;
therefore, budgeted for each participating DICECE office. These will be used for data&#13;
entry, cleaning, management and analysis, as well as transmission and receipt of data&#13;
to/from the MOE and NACECE on a continuous basis. In DICECE offices that do not&#13;
have electricity or telephone connections, the provision of computers with fax/modems&#13;
will be staggered, and the project will attempt to find better rental space for these offices.&#13;
In addition, depending upon the availability of funds, the project could provide for a&#13;
computer networking system (including electronic mail facility) within the Ministry of&#13;
Education and NACECE to facilitate intradepartmental communication.&#13;
34.   At this time, all monitoring and evaluation work, as well as analysis of data&#13;
collected at the district level, is done at the national level. However, the capacity for&#13;
undertaking rapid assessments based on data and using these assessments to alter program&#13;
design or implementation remains weak at the national level. The project will provide for&#13;
two new staff positions - data entry person and data analyst - at both the MOE and the&#13;
NACECE. In addition, the project will attempt to build basic data collection,&#13;
management and analysis capacity at the district level. This will involve training of&#13;
District Statistical Officers in data entry, database management, simple analysis of&#13;
monitoring data, and dissemination of monitoring analysis back to the ECD centers.&#13;
Finally, the project will provide minimal training in the maintenance and updating of&#13;
child cards, center registers and center wall-charts to ECD center head-teachers and&#13;
workers.&#13;

Midterm Evaluation&#13;
35.   Midtern evaluation of the project will be undertaken with three instruments: a&#13;
repeat survey of ECD centers, a repeat survey of households, and a participatory&#13;
beneficiary assessment. For the household survey, sampling design will have to be&#13;
developed so as to ensure inclusion of control households that will not have access to&#13;
project-supported ECD centers as well as sufficient coverage of households exposed to&#13;
different project components. The repeat household survey will obtain information on&#13;
household income, household expenditure on preprimary (and primary) education,&#13;
parental education and age, and the nurnber of children and their age, sex, weight, height,&#13;
immunization status, participation in preschool or school, and performance on simple&#13;
cognitive tests. A comparison of the results from the baseline household survey with&#13;
those from the midterm survey, with appropriate controls for project intervention and&#13;
changes in household situations, will indicate the midterm impact of the project on&#13;
outcome indicators.&#13;
36.   The repeat survey of ECD centers will focus on physical facilities, software (i.e.,&#13;
books, learning materials) availability, number of trained teachers, involvement of school&#13;
and parents committees in school management, and frequency and coverage of center-&#13;
wide deworming, growth monitoring and nutritional supplementation activities. As in the&#13;
case of the household survey, a comparison of the results from the baseline survey of&#13;
ECD centers with those from the midterm ECD center survey, with appropriate controls&#13;
for project intervention, will indicate the midterm impact of the project on output&#13;
indicators.&#13;
37.   Finally, the participatory beneficiary assessment will use focus-group discussion&#13;
methods to (midterm) evaluate the impact of the project on community and parental&#13;
attitudes and outlooks toward preprimary education and on classroom practices and ECD&#13;
teacher philosophies. In addition, the beneficiary assessment will try to measure the&#13;
satisfaction of parents and communities with the project intervention and solicit their&#13;
suggestions and comments on changes in project design and implementation.&#13;

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.   Investment in ECD is one of the instruments that the Kenyan government has&#13;
identified to a achieve the World Education Summit goals of (a) universal primary&#13;
education by the year 2000, (b) completion of primary education by at least 80% by the&#13;
year 2000. The proposed project will improve the quality of the present ECD centers in&#13;
Kenya though six related activities that will cover 1.2 million children by the 5th year of&#13;
the project. The first few years of life are crucial in the development of human capital.&#13;
The development of the brain is almost fully completed during this period and the&#13;
adverse consequences of any nutritional or cognitive developmental deficiencies are&#13;
lifelong. Parents are the primary caregivers in early childhood. Improving parenting&#13;
skills and providing key information on a child's developmental needs are widely&#13;
recognized as effective mechanisms for improving child development outcomes.&#13;
Successful Bank projects that have incorporated this approach include the Tamil Nadu&#13;
Integrated Nutrition Project which succeeded in reducing severe malnutrition in infants&#13;
by 50% and a number of ECD projects in Latin America, iiotably Colombia, Chile and&#13;
Mexico. The quality of the ECD programs is another important determinant of its&#13;
eventual impact on beneficiaries. Teacher training and support and parental involvement&#13;
are important ingredients of high quality programs. Teacher-pupil ratios and learning&#13;
materials also affect quality. The project will significantly improve the quality of ECD&#13;
services in Kenya.&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
2.    The Kenya Poverty Assessment Report (Report No. 13152-KE) shows that&#13;
primary school enrollment in Kenya is high by African standards, although still far short&#13;
of universal primary education. Enrollment at the primary level attained in 1994 is at&#13;
73% (net enrollment), and 80% (gross enrollment). However, completion rates in recent&#13;
years had been declining particularly amongst low income households. The most recent&#13;
data from Kenya's Welfare Monitoring System survey of 1994 indicates that of those&#13;
who enrolled in standard 1 in 1986, only 46% completed standard 8 (in 1993). This&#13;
implies a drop-out rate of more than fifty percent. In addition, rates of grade repetition in&#13;
primary school are high. The reduction in the level of wastage in the primary school&#13;
system in Kenya is expected to be one of the main contributions of the ECD project. The&#13;
high drop-out and repetition rates have been due to many school related factors such as&#13;
high pupil-teacher ratios, inadequate textbook provision, and poor classroom&#13;
environment. These may also be related to poor preparation of the child for schooling.&#13;
Available evidence suggests that dropout rates are highest between grades I and 2&#13;
probably due to the inability of the child to adapt to the difficult transition from home to&#13;
the school environment. Experience in primary schools in Latin American countries, in&#13;
the United States and in Turkey indicate that the drop-out and repetition rates can be&#13;
reduced by preschool programs which prepare the child for schooling--socially through&#13;
social stimulation and physically through better health and nutrition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.    The expected benefits from ECD project include:&#13;
(a)   a reduction in the number of repeaters and drop-outs in the early primary&#13;
grades which translates into fiscal savings to the government, and financial&#13;
savings to parents who pay for primary school fees, uniform and&#13;
transportation;&#13;
(b    incremental lifetime earnings for children reached by the program;&#13;
(c)   improved nutritionAhealth outcomes for children reached through the&#13;
nutrition interventions within the ECD program;&#13;
(d)   incremental earnings of the teachers trained under the program because of&#13;
higher or more regular contributions from parents;&#13;
(e)   incremental earnings of parents (mothers especially) as a result of&#13;
releasing their time for economic activities; and&#13;
(f)   increase in schooling participation for young girls, who would be released&#13;
from usual chores of child-minding;&#13;
4.    For purposes of the present analysis, benefit (a) and benefit (b) are calculated and&#13;
included in the benefit streams from the project. Benefits (c) to (f) will be described only&#13;
in qualitative terms.&#13;
5.    Repetition and Drop-out Rates. Table 1 clearly indicates very low retention&#13;
rates in the primary school system in Kenya. Roughly 43% of the school entrants in 1986&#13;
completed the primary schooling cycle in 1993. This implies that about 57% of all&#13;
children entering the system are dropping out.&#13;
6.    The economic consequences of this type of wastage at the primary school level&#13;
are significant. Firstly, each year of grade repetition implies that an extra year's&#13;
expenditures are committed by the government and by parents. Thus, a program that&#13;
reduces repetition means savings for the government and for parents. The government&#13;
spends about $38 per child per year at the primary level, while households spend about&#13;
$17 per child for fees, books, uniforms and harambee contributions. (Kenya Public&#13;
Expenditure Review, WB 1994). The annual savings for the government and households&#13;
would then total roughly $55 per child per year.&#13;
7.    The ECD project is intended to improve the quality of primary school entrants, to&#13;
enable them to complete the primary school cycle on time. Thus, each year that a child&#13;
that progresses to complete the primary school cycle without repetition saves the&#13;
government and parents about $55 per child. An analysis of a student progression flow&#13;
was carried out to test the sensitivity of the benefits from lower repetition and drop-out&#13;
rates. In order to capture the economic benefits arising from the ECD project, a scenario&#13;
"with the project" is compared to a scenario "without the project". The economic benefit&#13;
from the project is the difference between the two scenarios.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

8.    Incremental Lifetime Earnings. Most of the literature on the economic benefits&#13;
from ECD programs focused on the incremental earnings for those who were reached by&#13;
preschool programs. Longitudinal studies indicate that each $1 invested in the program&#13;
had economic returns of $7, based on higher earnings of those who attended the program.&#13;
9.    Estimates of the likely incremental earnings as a result of the Kenya ECD project&#13;
is based on an analysis of household data (Deolalikar, 1995) from the Welfare Monitoring&#13;
Survey of 1994, which compares the likely marginal increase in wages of a person with,&#13;
say, preschool experience compared to someone with no education at all. Wage&#13;
equations were estimated holding individual characteristics (sex, age, etc.) constant. The&#13;
results indicate that an individual who completed preprimary schooling earns about 66%&#13;
more at the margin in daily wages compared to those with no education. Likewise the&#13;
estimates show that those with some primary school eam 210% more than those with pre-&#13;
primary schooling, at the margin. Table 2 shows that the marginal increase in wages&#13;
increases consistently as we move from some primary to primary complete and so on.&#13;
10.   The results from the household surveys were used in calculating the future&#13;
earnings stream, discounted to the present. These benefits accrue at about the 15th year&#13;
from start of the project--or at the time that this cohort joins the labor force.&#13;
11.   A separate set of benefits not quantified in the present analysis is the incremental&#13;
lifetime earnings of those children who would likely complete primary, secondary or&#13;
tertiary schooling as a result of the earlier attendance in ECD programs. Table 3 indicates&#13;
the likely earnings differentials by different schooling levels attained.&#13;
Other Economic Benefits from Early Child Development Interventions (Not&#13;
Quantified)&#13;
There are other economic benefits expected from the ECD project which are difficult to&#13;
quantify, and are therefore not included in the calculation of the project's benefit streams.&#13;
These benefits include:&#13;
Nutrition/Health Benefits. These benefits would result from the inclusion of&#13;
nutrition/health inputs in the ECD program. The economic benefits from nutrition&#13;
interventions is defined in terms, also of the incremental lifetime earnings of those whose&#13;
nutrition have been improved. Studies indicate better school performnance, higher lifetime&#13;
earnings, for those persons who had good early nutrition.&#13;
Release of Parents Time for Economic Activities. In urban areas and in plantation&#13;
areas in rural regions, a proportion of their time is released for productive work with the&#13;
promotion of ECD projects. For example, women who work in tea and coffee plantations&#13;
would benefit from leaving preschool children in ECD centers during their working&#13;
hours. In many parts of Kenya, the use of traditional child care had been declining&#13;
particularly in the urban areas where single mothers are increasing and in rural areas&#13;
where families are now more nuclear than extended. The high opportunity cost of time&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex J&#13;
Page 4 of 8&#13;
of women of reproductive age in Kenya has been observed from household data (Welfare&#13;
Monitoring Survey 1994).&#13;
Release of Young Girls for Schooling. The other effect from the investment is the&#13;
improved schooling participation of older girls. In many instances, the eldest daughter&#13;
handles child care as surrogate to the mother who has joined the labor force. Data from&#13;
the Kenya Welfare Monitoring Survey showed that school enrollment for girls fell by&#13;
50% when there was a pre-school child in the household.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis and Switching Values&#13;
Two crucial assumptions on the benefits streams of the project were subjected to&#13;
sensitivity analyses to test how the economic viability of the project changes under&#13;
various scenarios. The two most important assumptions relate to (1) the reduction rates&#13;
in the drop-out and repetition and (2) incremental lifetime earnings.&#13;
Switching values for the repetition and drop-out rates were used to see what happens to&#13;
the economic rates of return for various levels of school repetition and drop-out rates.&#13;
The basic run presented in Table 4 is based on a conservative assumption of 7 percentage&#13;
point improvement in the completion rates in the primary schools--that is, expectation of&#13;
improvement from the present level of primary school completion of 43% to 50%. The&#13;
sensitivity analysis indicates that the break-even point --or the percentage improvement&#13;
in completion rate required to bring the present value of benefits equal to the investment&#13;
cost of the project---is only 4 percentage points. This indicates that even small&#13;
improvements in the completion rates as a result of the ECD project would already make&#13;
the project economically viable. This is due largely to the cost to the government and to&#13;
parents of sending children to the primary schools. On the other hand, if the project&#13;
increases the completion rates from 7 percentage points to 14 percentage points, the&#13;
economic rates of return of the project increases from 32% to about 49 %.&#13;
A second simulation tested alternative assumptions on increases in lifetime earnings of&#13;
children reached by the project. Since the economy is very difficult to predict, a&#13;
simulation using switching values for future earnings was applied. Using a "no&#13;
increment" assumption for future earnings, the analysis indicates that the economic rate&#13;
of return from the project declines to about 26% from 32% in the 'with incremental&#13;
earnings' assumption. This represents a minimal impact on the returns from the project.&#13;
The reason is that the most of these returns accrue much later - on the 16th year (or 15&#13;
years after children complete preschools).&#13;
A further simulation was done to test the incremental lifetime earning effects from the&#13;
efficiency gained in primary schooling--that is, better progression into higher levels of&#13;
schooling and thus, increase the lifetime earnings. Recall that the base assumptions on&#13;
benefits had calculated only the fiscal savings from lower drop-outs and repetition. If the&#13;
progression rate in primary schooling is indeed realized, future earnings of those who&#13;
completed higher levels of schooling would likely increase by a large factor as seen in&#13;
Tables 2 Wage Regression) and Table 3 Mean Wage By Schooling Level. Using the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex J&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
estimates from the wage differentials at various levels of schooling, incremental earnings&#13;
from improved progression rate could be calculated. The sensitivity analysis using such&#13;
additional project benefits from a progression rate of 14% would result in a substantial&#13;
improvement in the economic rate of return to about 42%.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
The overall evaluation given in a summary table in Table 4 indicates that the Kenya ECD&#13;
project is a highly viable project from the economic point of view. It is estimated that $1&#13;
invested in the project would likely yield an equivalent of about $5 returns in present&#13;
value terms. The economic rate of return is about 33%, which is higher than many&#13;
projects of this nature.&#13;
There are second-round and indirect benefits from the project which are difficult to&#13;
quantify and are excluded from the present calculations. Nutrition and health benefits&#13;
from the nutrition components of the project would provide lifelong impact on&#13;
productivity. It is likely that growth monitoring, and nutrition and health education will&#13;
improve the children's growth and future earnings potential. The ECD program will also&#13;
ease the burden from the elder siblings who do child care tasks--which will therefore&#13;
encourage schooling participation especially for girls. For mothers, it is likely that their&#13;
time for child care would be released for economically productive activities, and would&#13;
thus, increase household incomes. Likewise, benefits can be expected from capacity&#13;
building of community organizations, especially the preschool committees. More&#13;
preschool teachers would be trained in new skills, and therefore would enhance their&#13;
productivity and incomes.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The development objective of the Early
            Childhood Development (ECD) Project is to improve quality
            and educability of children in poor Kenyan households.  The
            project seeks to: (1) improve child cognitive and
            psycho-social development; (2) improve child health and
            nutrition; (3) increase school enrollment at the appropriate
            age; and (4) reduce dropout and repetition rates in lower
            primary school.  An important collaborative objective is to
            improve the human capital potential specifically of poor and
            otherwise disadvantaged pre-schoolers.  The project consists
            of two core components: (1) improving ECD worker training,
            performance, and supervision; and (2) community capacity
            building, mobilization, and parenting education.  Three
            pilot interventions will test options to develop
            cost-effective, replicable models for: (1) improving the
            financing of ECD services in poor communities by way of
            community grants; (2) raising nutrition and health standards
            of pre-schoolers, including those in the particularly
            vulnerable first three years of life; and (3) smoothing the
            transition from pre-school to primary school.
