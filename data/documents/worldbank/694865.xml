ANDHRA PRADESH HAZARD MITIGATION AND EMERGENCY CYCLONE&#13;
RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
Section A: BACKGROUND&#13;
AREA DESCRIPTION&#13;
I.    Andhra Pradesh (AP) covers 274,000 square km on the east coast of India, and it is the&#13;
country's fifth largest state, accounting for 8.4 percent of its total area. It is surrounded by&#13;
Madhya Pradesh and Orissa to the north, Maharashtra to the north and west, Tamil Nadu and&#13;
Karnataka to the south, and the Bay of Bengal to the east. AP is also the fourth most populous&#13;
state, with a predominantly rural population of over 66 million.' Next to Tamil Nadu, the state&#13;
registers the highest proportion of agricultural labor households, and only one of its 23 districts&#13;
is considered non-rural. Its 29,293 villages are grouped into 1,104 mandals, which are basic&#13;
administrative units for regulatory, revenue and development functions. Three distinct&#13;
geographical regions include: Telengana, formerly part of the princely state of Hyderabad&#13;
(which includes the capital city), Rayalaseema, a drought-prone area comprising four districts&#13;
(Chittoor, Kurnool, Cuddapah and Anantapur), and Coastal Andhra, spread along the state's&#13;
1,030 km of fertile lands along the coastline on the Bay of Bengal. Coastal Andhra is divided in&#13;
nine districts, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West Godavari,&#13;
Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam, and Nellore. Among these primarily agricultural districts, Guntur,&#13;
Krishna, and East and West Godavari are renowned for their complex and productive irrigation&#13;
systems, which take advantage of the deltas of two of India's largest rivers, the Godavari and the&#13;
Krishna. East and West Godavari by themselves are among the most prosperous areas of AP, as&#13;
well as most populous, with densities of 670 and 510 persons per sq km respectively, well over&#13;
the state's average of 268 persons per sq km. Sharp social divisions, however, characterize the&#13;
rural communities of the affluent delta and coastal plains, particularly between land-owning&#13;
upper castes and the landless dalits.&#13;
VULNERABILITY TO NATURAL HAZARDS&#13;
2.    In India, the cyclones develop in the pre-monsoon (April to May) and post-monsoon&#13;
seasons (October to December), but most of them tend to form in the month of November.&#13;
Cyclones on the east coast originate in the Bay of Bengal, the Andaman Sea or the South China&#13;
Sea, and usually reach the coastline of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal,&#13;
which are the most vulnerable to these types of hazards. Two of the deadliest cyclones of this&#13;
century, with fatalities of about 10,000 people in each case, took place in Orissa and Andhra&#13;
Pradesh during October 1971 and November 1977 respectively. The states bordering the Arabian&#13;
Sea on the west coast are not completely safe either, as Kerala, Gujarat - and to a lesser extent&#13;
Maharashtra - are also prone to cyclones. With a frequency of four cyclones per year, one of&#13;
which usually becomes severe, the Bay of Bengal accounts for seven percent of the annual&#13;
I   According to the 1991 census.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
tropical cyclone activity worldwide. Despite this relatively low percentage, the level of human&#13;
and property loss that cyclones cause around the Bay is very high. Once the cyclones enter the&#13;
mainland, they give way to heavy rains which often translate into floods, as it was the case with&#13;
the damaging cyclone-induced floods in the Godavari delta, in August of 1986. Many drought-&#13;
prone areas adjacent to coastal districts in eastern maritime states are thus vulnerable to flash&#13;
floods originated by the torrential rains induced by the cyclonic depression. In addition to&#13;
cyclones and its related hazards, monsoon depressions over the north and central areas of the Bay&#13;
of Bengal move until reaching north and central India, including portions of Andhra Pradesh,&#13;
bringing heavy to very heavy rains and causing floods in the inland rivers between June and&#13;
September.&#13;
AP VULNERABILITY PROFILE&#13;
3.     Social and economic life of AP's population is characterized by recurring natural&#13;
disasters. The state is exposed to cyclones, storm surges, floods, and droughts. According to the&#13;
available disaster inventories, AP is the state that has suffered the most from the adverse effects&#13;
of severe cyclones. It has been estimated that about 44 percent of AP's total territory is&#13;
vulnerable to tropical storms and related hazards,2 while its coastal belt is likely to be the most&#13;
vulnerable region in India to these natural phenomena. Khamman district, in the Telengana&#13;
region, is affected by monsoon floods, along with five districts in Coastal AP. Four districts in&#13;
Rayalaseema and five in Telengana experience drought. Along the coastline, the section between&#13;
Nizampatnam and Machilipatnam is the most prone to storm surges. The fertile Delta areas of&#13;
the Godavari and the Krishna rivers, which contribute substantially to the state's economic&#13;
prosperity, face flood and drainage problems, and more so in the aftermath of cyclones.&#13;
4.     More than sixty cyclones have affected AP this century. The incidence of cyclones&#13;
seems to have increased in the past decades, to the extent that severe cyclones have become a&#13;
common event occurring every two to three years, repeatedly and severely affecting the state's&#13;
economy while challenging its financial and institutional resources.3 Almost 29 million people&#13;
are vulnerable to cyclones and their effects in Coastal AP, 3.3 million of whom belong to&#13;
communities located within five km of the seashore. The deadliest cyclone in the last twenty&#13;
years took place in November 1977 killing about 10,000 people. More recently, the May 1990&#13;
cyclone, with a death toll close to 1,000 people, caused about US$1.25 billion in damage in ten&#13;
districts, including the entire coast. Between 1977 and 1992, about 13,000 lives and 338,000&#13;
cattle were lost due to cyclones and floods, and nearly 3.3 million houses damaged.4&#13;
5.     May cyclones are relatively rare in the region, and only about 13 have affected AP in this&#13;
month this century. However, when they badly hit the Delta areas, as it happened in 1979 in the&#13;
Krishna district - where 80 percent of the casualties occurred - the population in danger may be&#13;
higher than usual. May is rice harvesting season, and a good number of itinerant laborers come&#13;
to the delta from less fertile areas of AP in search of work. Since they lack awareness of the&#13;
area's most prevalent hazards, this migrant population is more vulnerable than the permanent&#13;
delta residents. Similarly, entire families have come to the delta districts to engage in activities&#13;

related to shrimp farming, which has taken off recently in the area. They are involved in the&#13;
collection of fingerlings, living for several months a year in makeshift shelters along the&#13;
marshes. The warnings may not reach them on time, and even when they do, their inexperience&#13;
renders them highly vulnerable.&#13;
6.     The Godavari and the Krishna rivers have well-defined stable courses, and their natural&#13;
and man-made banks have usually been capable of carrying flood discharges, with the exception&#13;
of their delta areas. Traditionally, the flood problem in AP had been confined to the spilling of&#13;
smaller rivers and the submersion of marginal areas surrounding Kolleru lake. However, the&#13;
drainage problem in the delta zones of the coastal districts has worsened, thereby multiplying the&#13;
destructive potential of cyclones and increasing flood hazards. Moreover, when a storm surge&#13;
develops, as it was the case during the severe November 1977, May 1990 and November 1996&#13;
cyclones, threats to humans and property multiply as the sea water may inundate coastal areas&#13;
which are already being subjected to torrential rains. Finally, a critical additional factor affecting&#13;
the flood management and the irrigation systems is the lack of maintenance. On several&#13;
occasions, such as the May 1979 cyclone, most of the deaths were occasioned by breaches to the&#13;
chains of tanks and canals, and over-flooding due in part to the choking of drains by silting and&#13;
growth of weeds.&#13;
VULNERABILITY FACTORS&#13;
7.     Several factors have combined to compound natural disaster vulnerability in AP: (i) the&#13;
fact that over 50 percent of cyclones in the region turn into severe storms which often come&#13;
accompanied by storm surges; (ii) the low-lying lands that prevail along most of the Indian&#13;
eastern shore, particularly in the deltas, are subject to widespread flooding and deep inland sea&#13;
water incursion that even a few meters high storm surge can create; (iii) limited capacity for&#13;
disaster management and integrated planning and (iv) high concentrations of population,&#13;
infrastructure and economic activities along the shoreline.&#13;
8.     Simultaneously, flood hazards in the delta areas of the state have been further&#13;
exacerbated by: (i) geomorphologic factors such as soil characteristics in the Krishna delta which&#13;
makes the area poor for the infiltration of flood waters; (ii) interference with the natural delta&#13;
system, for example the construction of canals, channels, drains, etc., that cut across the parallel&#13;
to subparallel beach ridges, which has changed the area's land cover enormously; and related to&#13;
the latter, (iii) lack of maintenance of infrastructure and key elements, i.e., drains, embankments,&#13;
etc. of the flood pTotection and irrigation systems (as it was made evident during the 1996&#13;
disasters); and (iv) the lack of coastal zone and delta management. In the absence of such a&#13;
program, mangroves, which naturally mitigate against storm surges and high winds, are being&#13;
converted into aquaculture ponds or depleted for fuel wood. Shrimp farming, for instance, has&#13;
been intensifying in the region in recent years, without close monitoring of its environmental&#13;
impacts. Over-development and denuding of coastal zones of their protective vegetation belts&#13;
have resulted in increased vulnerability, particularly to storm surges, which are perhaps the most&#13;
devastating cyclonic-related hazard as they usually account for the majority of casualties and&#13;
property losses. Experts agree that it was the disappearance of mangrove swamps coupled with&#13;
significant gaps in the tree shelter belts along the coast that allowed the storm surge during the&#13;
1990 May cyclone to reach up to 20 km inland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
DISASTER MANAGEMENT RECORD&#13;
9.     Cyclone disaster management normally includes storm prediction and tracking,&#13;
preparedness, prevention, impact assessment and response measures. While the GOAP has&#13;
demonstrated a commitment to addressing short-term relief issues, they are less experienced with&#13;
long-term issues involving mitigation and recovery. A relatively efficient warning system, which&#13;
is one of the essential measures of cyclone disaster preparedness, has been established in India.&#13;
Given the existing detection, tracking and forecasting capabilities, it is highly unlikely today that&#13;
the formation of a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal or the Arabian Sea would go undetected.&#13;
Presently, cyclones in these regions are detected and tracked through conventional observations,&#13;
using ten cyclone detection radars with 400 km range and various satellites. Warnings are&#13;
provided through different cyclone warning centers and coordination centers strategically located&#13;
throughout the national territory. Additionally, the India Meteorological Department has&#13;
installed a satellite-based disaster warning system (DWS), with receiving stations at the offices&#13;
of Collectors and the Police.&#13;
10.   In 1971 the Cyclone Distress Mitigation Committee of Andhra Pradesh, organized under&#13;
the advice of the central government a few years earlier, produced a report on the ways to&#13;
improve disaster management in the state. Until 1980s the report's recommendations were not&#13;
incorporated into policy. The massive death toll that occurred in the 1977 motivated authorities&#13;
at the central and state level to adopt a more active stance regarding disaster preparedness. By&#13;
1981, AP has finalized its first Cyclone Contingency Plan. The Relief Department has developed&#13;
manuals, coordination procedures and training programs which have improved the effectiveness&#13;
of these types of actions, as made evident by the dramatic reduction in fatalities during the most&#13;
recent cyclones.&#13;
11.    As the experience of AP helps illustrate, cyclones can be an obstacle to economic and&#13;
social development. The fact that these types of disasters repeatedly affect certain areas of the&#13;
state, thereby making them even more vulnerable, makes it imperative to develop and implement&#13;
a comprehensive disaster management program that can reach district and subdistrict levels&#13;
effectively. For example, many of the districts affected by the most recent disaster had suffered&#13;
the ravages of the November 1977 and May 1990 cyclones, the landfalls of which are less than&#13;
50 km apart. Vulnerability to cyclones has also increased due to rapid development along the AP&#13;
coastline. Effective steps to minimize damage and losses are slow in implementation, while&#13;
some of the thriving economic activities may be developing on highly exposed sites. In this&#13;
respect, some Indian experts have indicated that the cropping pattern in Coastal AP should be&#13;
modified to take into account cyclone occurrence, and that poultry farming may be totally&#13;
unsuitable in the vulnerable areas.5&#13;
12.   In their approach to natural hazards GOAP has been focusing on saving human lives and&#13;
on restoring infrastructure as soon as possible. However justifiable this approach is, it has tended&#13;
to overshadow any concerted effort in long-term disaster mitigation. The relief-focused disaster&#13;
management policy has created amongst the population a "disaster-relief' syndrome which can&#13;
hardly be maintained today: it is increasingly becoming difficult for the state government to&#13;
sustain these frequent expenditures.&#13;
See for example S.B. Synghal. 1992. "Managing Cyclones Emergencies (Andhra - A Case Study)" in World&#13;
Congress on Natural Hazard Reduction, New Delhi, Jan. 10-1 4, 1992. Pp. 245-255,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
13.    Some neighboring states have attempted to develop more comprehensive cyclone&#13;
disaster management schemes. Tamil Nadu, for instance, formulated an "Anti-Disaster Plan,"&#13;
which includes vulnerability analysis, risk mapping, zoning and building regulation, design and&#13;
construction of anti-cyclone community shelters and cyclone-resistant core units for huts, as well&#13;
as programs for improved warning systems. Within AP itself, there are a fair number of institutes&#13;
and centers committed to the study of disasters, and the development of disaster mitigation&#13;
strategies. These resources which can act as repository of and conduit for information, remain&#13;
largely untapped. The development history of the irrigation system in the Godavari delta,&#13;
triggered by the watershed management efforts led by Sir Arthur Cotton in the mid- 19th century,&#13;
already offers an example of the extent to which foresight and investing for the future may help&#13;
in protecting and improving the lives of those living in disaster-prone areas.&#13;
PREVIOUS BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
14.    After the May 1990 cyclone, the Bank approved the Andhra Pradesh Cyclone&#13;
Emergency Reconstruction Project (CERP), consisting of Cr. 2179-IN, Loan 3260-IN, and Cr.&#13;
1665-IN reallocation, totaling US$265 million (the estimated cost of the total project was&#13;
US$380 million). In addition to supporting reconstruction operations in the affected districts,&#13;
Bank assistance was also intended for the development of a Delta Plan to modernize water&#13;
management in the Krishna-Godavari delta and in the coastal area. The CERP closed as planned&#13;
in March 1993, after having fully disbursed the allocated funds. Infrastructure restoration was&#13;
successfully completed, incorporating higher design and construction standards. The&#13;
Implementation Completion Report (ICR # 14662) commented favorably on the project's&#13;
reconstruction component. However, it expressed concern regarding the long-term sustainability&#13;
of the CERP mitigation objectives, since (i) financial allocations for maintenance of project&#13;
works, particularly irrigation and drainage infrastructure, continued to be insufficient; and (ii) the&#13;
technical studies for the delta and other coastal areas, essential for establishment of integrated&#13;
planning schemes in AP's most vulnerable areas, were not completed. As the ICR concluded,&#13;
"the continuing inadequacy of maintenance funding for existing works threatens their&#13;
sustainability, and the failure to identify coordinated follow-up programs for development,&#13;
protection and mitigation in the project area means that a high risk of future disasters continues&#13;
to exist" (p. vi). According to the ICR, the original project design was modified during&#13;
implementation, with substantial increases in the physical targets for irrigation and drainage,&#13;
roads and bridges, municipal services and electricity components. This change was possible&#13;
because of the savings in local currency and the reallocations from the earmarkings for the slow&#13;
disbursing components such as the funds set aside for the delta management studies.&#13;
15.    The ICR's favorable report on the reconstruction of infrastructure was corroborated&#13;
during the November 1996 cyclone. Given higher design standards, the roads constructed under&#13;
the CERP withstood the ravages of this storm with little damage. Similarly, cyclone shelters&#13;
erected under the project were in good condition and were used extensively during the&#13;
emergency period. By contrast, emergency shelters built in the aftermath of the November 1977&#13;
cyclone were in a poor state of repair. The GOAP has not continued construction of additional&#13;
improved infrastructure, including investments into tree shelter belts, nor undertaken programs&#13;
for hazard reduction after the completion of the CERP, as was agreed by the ICR mission in&#13;
1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
THE NOVEMBER, 1996, CYCLONE DISASTER&#13;
16.    The state experienced a series of heavy rains, floods and smaller intensity cyclones&#13;
between June and November 1996. Particularly damaging events occurred between June 12 and&#13;
17, August 25 and September 9, and throughout October. Almost all the Coastal and&#13;
Rayalaseema regions, as well as a few districts in Telengana suffered human losses and damage&#13;
to their infrastructure and economic assets. The four districts comprising Rayalaseema, along&#13;
with East and West Godavari and Prakasam in Coastal AP, and Khammam and Warangal in&#13;
Telengana, were especially hard hit by these events. The affected communities were in an early&#13;
stage of recovery when the most recent cyclone hit AP during the evening of November 6,&#13;
reaching wind speeds between 200 to 250 kmh and giving way to a storm surge of up to 2.2&#13;
meters. It was estimated that 1,057 people died in the cyclone, which brings the total number of&#13;
lives lost in disasters between June and December to 1,689 . As the cyclone entered the mainland&#13;
south of the port of Kakinada, it left a track of about 15 km wide, seriously affecting coastal and&#13;
riverine areas in East and West Godavari, and also causing some damage in the adjoining&#13;
Krishna and Khammam districts. The total damage caused by disasters between June and&#13;
December, including the latest cyclone, is estimated at over US$2 billion, with the cyclone alone&#13;
exceeding US$1.5 billion. These losses stem from the substantial damage to infrastructure (such&#13;
as irrigation, roads and bridges), public buildings, agricultural and cash crops, animal husbandry,&#13;
fisheries, and housing. Major losses occurred in the agriculture sector, specifically coconut,&#13;
mango, cashew, banana, and other horticulture crops, as well as paddy, sugar cane, tobacco and&#13;
cotton. Damage to coconut production in the central delta in East Godavari alone was estimated&#13;
at Rs3O billion (US$850 million). Most of the 600,000 housing units lost were located in this&#13;
same district. About 1,300 kms of roads were damaged, including 210 kms of the National&#13;
Highway 5, which connects East and West Godavari with Calcutta and Madras. The energy&#13;
sector was also impacted since about 40 of the 220 KV and 15 of the 132 KV line towers either&#13;
collapsed or were damaged. As a result, seventeen substations were out of service. The overall&#13;
impact of the latest cyclone on the state's economy was significant, especially considering that&#13;
its finances were already precarious following the loss of revenue due to the 1994 introduction of&#13;
subsidized rice prices, and the prohibition of liquor sales.&#13;
PRE-CYCLONE ACTIONS AND DISASTER RELIEF&#13;
17.    Although wind speeds were the highest experienced in recent history, loss of life was&#13;
relatively low, which indicates that the response mechanism has become more effective. With&#13;
the warning system available, it is possible to alert some people three to five days in advance.&#13;
During the latest cyclone, warnings were timely issued and in the most affected districts about&#13;
200,000 people were evacuated and 800 relief camps established. Search and rescue were led by&#13;
the Army, the Navy and the Air Force authorities, who helped the marooned fishermen and&#13;
villagers reach higher grounds and also recovered the bodies of the dead. However, many of&#13;
those who lost their lives, mostly fishermen who remained at sea, did not heed the warnings.&#13;
18.    Between June and December 1996, the GOAP allocated about Rs2 billion (US$57&#13;
million) for immediate relief and rehabilitation in the cyclone and flood affected areas. In&#13;
response to the November 6 cyclone, revenue staff was deputed to deal with the rehabilitation&#13;
efforts as early as November 9. Few families needed to stay long in the cyclone shelters, as they&#13;
quickly reconstructed their thatch houses with financial assistance from the government. The&#13;
GOAP also called for the donations to the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister 's Cyclone Relief&#13;
Fund, 1996, and requested for outside help to deal with the disaster. The use of ongoing,&#13;
centrally-sponsored programs was requested to help in the recovery, such as the Indira Awaas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
Yojana for the reconstruction activities. The World Bank was also approached with a request for&#13;
assistance. International and national non-governmental organizations (NGOs) started their field&#13;
operations soon after the disaster, committing to the relief so far about US$0.5 million. The&#13;
restoration of essential services such as electrical power supply or the clearance of major&#13;
thoroughfares was done promptly, but according to the old low design standards. The GOAP&#13;
responded well to the emergency, made an effort to coordinate relief assistance by NGOs and&#13;
other parties, and disseminated disaster information on the Internet.&#13;
NEEDS AND PRIORITIES&#13;
19.    The warning system - which encompasses a wide variety of communications from the&#13;
most traditional to the most modern - still has several weak links that can fail under severe&#13;
weather conditions. Some of the tracking equipment (e.g., radar) requires upgrading and state-of-&#13;
the-art software for more accurate prediction of the cyclone's landfall is needed. The capacity for&#13;
reliable high wind speed measurement (in excess of 100 km per hour) is lacking. A fundamental&#13;
element missing in the tracking system in India is a reconnaissance aircraft facility that can&#13;
provide valuable information on the location of the cyclone center, as well as details on its&#13;
intensity and the spatial distribution of winds. Without an access to meteorological observations&#13;
in the upper air in the field of a cyclone at open sea, forecasting, its tracking for 24-36 hours in&#13;
advance and the location of landfall are likely to be insufficiently reliable, especially in view of&#13;
cyclones frequent change of course. As exact as possible location of the cyclone landfall is&#13;
crucial, given that this is the place around which maximum damage would be experienced and&#13;
where pre- and post-disaster management measures would be most needed. Accuracy is also&#13;
required to avoid unnecessarily alarming and evacuating the population, which may further&#13;
worsen the problems that usually exist with the public's perception and understanding of cyclone&#13;
threat. Evacuation is a costly and difficult decision, and frequent and inaccurate warnings tend&#13;
to create the "cry-wolf' syndrome, whereby people do not take warnings seriously.&#13;
20.    Key aspects of long-term disaster mitigation continue to demand urgent attention in the&#13;
state. This is revealed by the fact that as the death toll of recent cyclones has diminished&#13;
considerably, damage to infrastructure and other assets has continued to increase.&#13;
Correspondingly, statistical records for AP indicate that economic losses associated with&#13;
cyclones have been growing since the late 1 960s. The present strategies for development of&#13;
cyclone-prone areas are carried out mostly on an ad hoc basis. Planning at the state level does&#13;
not yet incorporate disaster prevention measures in an integrated manner. The incorporation of a&#13;
strategy for disaster mitigation within an integrated development framework in the high risk area&#13;
would have to bring together the decisions and investment activities of many departments, such&#13;
as agriculture, irrigation, forestry, roads and buildings, and so forth. Traditionally, however, the&#13;
barrier of compartmentalization has made it difficult to find the common ground required for the&#13;
governmental and managerial innovations needed to bring such an approach to fruition. As a&#13;
result, promotion of socio-economic development and restoration of lost assets have rarely been&#13;
accompanied by prevention/mitigation of future disaster impacts. In terms of restoration of&#13;
infrastructure, post-cyclone recovery efforts in AP have been successful. In the absence of a&#13;
comprehensive and integrated development plan, however, many of the programs and&#13;
components included in the recovery efforts have been implemented without a clear&#13;
understanding of their interrelationships and without identifying areas of possible conflicts. In&#13;
addition, as the recent cyclone made evident, lack of maintenance due to inadequate maintenance&#13;
budgets, along with inappropriate design criteria and construction standards used in the high risk&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
areas, continue to be a central factor influencing the high vulnerability of infrastructure in coastal&#13;
AP.&#13;
21.    The experience of recent emergency responses and recovery efforts and the lessons&#13;
learned from the implementation of the CERP, indicate the need to address the following key&#13;
priority issues in order to bring together disaster management and development planning&#13;
activities in the areas vulnerable to cyclones and related hazards in AP: (i) the formulation and&#13;
implementation of long-term hazard reduction and mitigation measures as an essential part of the&#13;
strategy for dealing with the recurring disasters in an affordable and efficient manner; (ii) the&#13;
carrying out of coastal and delta management, watershed management and flood forecasting&#13;
studies to develop mitigation strategies (as originally required under the CERP); (iii) the&#13;
involvement of vulnerable communities in the design and implementation of hazard mitigation&#13;
prograns, and the management and maintenance of hazard reduction structures; (iv) integrated&#13;
actions and initiatives that have a bearing on the management of the coastal areas and the&#13;
upstream watersheds; (v) improved design criteria and construction practices in the high risk&#13;
areas; (vi) community planning of integrated infrastructure restoration through prioritization at&#13;
the District level rather than by the sector Departments; and (vii) adequate operation and&#13;
maintenance budget appropriations to foster sustainable mitigation activities (infrastructure&#13;
damage in the 1996 disasters have occurred primarily due to the poor state of repair of facilities).&#13;
JANMABHOOMI - A VEHICLE FOR COMMUNITY MOBILIZATION&#13;
22.   In the context of an initiative to increase people's self-reliance and ownership of&#13;
essential community assets, GOAP has launched in 1995 the Janmabhoomi program (see&#13;
Attachment 1 1), the purpose of which is to encourage all communities in the state to take an&#13;
active role in the development activities. Janmabhoomi is a three-pronged program, consisting of&#13;
Prajala Vaddaku Paalana (or "the government at the doorstep of the people"), where&#13;
government officials hold "town hall meetings" in villages and neighborhoods to identify&#13;
community needs and offer assistance in attaining them. In micro planning the residents are&#13;
acquainted with the government's programs and assisted in the preparation of their action plans&#13;
for the following years. Sramadanam (or "community works") is the central activity of the&#13;
program, as it involves direct community contribution in labor and/or money towards repairs,&#13;
maintenance and/or construction of community assets. This partnership between the government&#13;
and the people, based on the "matching grant" principle, has to date generated more than 400,000&#13;
Sramadanam works (valued at about US$13 million) and involved about 2,500,000 people. The&#13;
GOAP has volunteered to expand this movement to include community-based hazard reduction&#13;
activities. International experience indicates that true natural hazard vulnerability reduction&#13;
occurs only if the government and the people jointly take appropriate action to minimize the&#13;
risks of future losses. This is especially true in regions such as Andhra Pradesh where the&#13;
dominant hazard (cyclone) has high frequency and where enhancement of quality of&#13;
construction, operation and maintenance are crucial for loss reduction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
Section B: BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
23.   In view of the recurrence and frequency of cyclone and flood disasters, assisting the&#13;
GOAP to mainstream hazard reduction planning becomes a prerequisite for sustainability of&#13;
physical investments. The rationale for Bank involvement is therefore: (a) the Bank's criteria for&#13;
providing emergency recovery assistance (OP 8.50), specifically (i) the frequency of recurring&#13;
emergencies (such as floods and cyclones), and (ii) the prospects for reducing hazards from&#13;
similar natural disasters in the future; (b) the findings of the ICR for the previous Andhra&#13;
Pradesh Cyclone Emergency Reconstruction Project, where the sustainability of infrastructure&#13;
investments was questioned because of the project's failure to address long-term mitigation&#13;
measures; and (c) the benefits of long-term disaster management versus the costs of repeated&#13;
short-term post-disaster reconstruction.&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
24.    The project objectives are (i) to assist the GOAP in preparing and implementing long-&#13;
term cyclone and flood hazard management in high risk areas with enhanced community&#13;
involvement, (ii) enhance the GOIs cyclone early warning capacity; and (iii) to restore lost&#13;
public infrastructure by incorporating improved design criteria, cyclone- and flood-resistant&#13;
siting, construction and quality control measures, so that such infrastructure will withstand the&#13;
intensities of future events.&#13;
25.    The proposed project sets out to ensure that mitigation is given its proper place in&#13;
reconstruction activities (short and medium term investment objectives) and the long-term&#13;
development planning of vulnerable areas. The acute need for immediate repair and&#13;
reconstruction of critical infrastructure would be addressed adequately. Building upon the&#13;
accomplishments of the CERP, every effort would be made to overcome its shortcomings with&#13;
regard to the sustainability of mitigation efforts and deficits in maintenance funds. All&#13;
reconstruction assistance would thus be conditioned upon the firm commitment of the GOAP to&#13;
establish permanent and effective disaster management mechanisms at the state, district and&#13;
local level.&#13;
RECOVERY STRATEGY&#13;
26.   In view of the exorbitant economic and social costs of recurring disasters such as the&#13;
latest AP cyclone, the proposed project adopts long-term disaster management as the guiding&#13;
principle of recovery, in order to avoid related damage to restored assets in future disasters.&#13;
Disaster management mitigates against three types of repeated disaster losses: (i) direct losses&#13;
(capital stock and inventories), (ii) indirect losses (lost income and productive capacity) and (iii)&#13;
secondary losses (decreases in economic growth and development). This model is especially&#13;
forceful in the context of Bank's agenda of poverty alleviation and sustainability of investments&#13;
in countries exposed to recurring natural hazards (such as cyclones). Therefore, the recovery&#13;
strategy for the proposed project would be based on the premise that any future investment in the&#13;
coastal cyclone-and flood-prone regions of AP is non-sustainable in the absence of&#13;
comprehensive cyclone and flood management. The GOAP has already prepared and will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
publish shortly a policy paper outlining its framework and approach to long-term hazard&#13;
reduction in Andhra Pradesh.&#13;
27.    The strategy for Bank assistance would focus on (i) hazard reduction through cyclone&#13;
forecasting, in addition to flood, watershed, coastal and storm surge management; (ii)&#13;
sustainability through, inter alia, close attention to operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) needs,&#13;
alternatives for community management of assets, and the establishment of an adequate&#13;
institutional framework for disaster management; (iii) coordinated recovery and mitigation&#13;
response through restoration of damaged infrastructure, and integrated planning at the district&#13;
and/or watershed levels, with special attention to inter-sectoral (i.e., inter-departmental) issues;&#13;
and (iv) community involvement to ensure ownership of programs and maintenance of assets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
Section C: PROJECT DESCRIPIMON&#13;
PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
28.   The proposed project, estimated to cost about US$220 million, would finance (a) hazard&#13;
management program (comprising 22.1 percent of total project cost including the GOI&#13;
component of 7.2 percent); (b) restoration of damaged public infrastructure (comprising 72.1&#13;
percent of total project cost); and (c) technical assistance for project implementation and&#13;
management, and financing for incremental operating costs on a declining scale. Total costs are&#13;
indicated for each component, in parentheses, in the following paragraphs, which include base&#13;
cost, design and supervision, and physical and price contingencies.&#13;
29.   L.     HAZARD MANAGEMENTPROGRAM. Given the serious risk of loss of life and&#13;
property, it is of paramount importance to establish a program that can promote and coordinate&#13;
prevention, mitigation and preparedness activities in AP, and establish the linkages between&#13;
these activities and development planning of the most vulnerable areas. The program would need&#13;
to encompass a set of inter-related components that would facilitate (i) risk assessments and&#13;
determination of vulnerability levels; (ii) enhancement of state, district and local institutional&#13;
capacity to prevent and mitigate natural hazards; and (iii) acquisition of tools and setting up of&#13;
programs for better disaster preparedness.&#13;
30.   Under this project, the selected prevention, mitigation and preparedness activities to be&#13;
financed are: (a) By GOAP: comprehensive cyclone and flood management studies, leading to&#13;
action plans, institutional and implementation framework; hazard mapping; communications and&#13;
information technology links to facilitate community involvement; and setting up of a&#13;
Vulnerability Reduction Fund; and (b) By GOI: enhancement of the India Meteorological&#13;
Department's early cyclone warning capacity on the East coast of India.&#13;
(a)    GOAP Activities (15 percent of project cost):&#13;
(i)    Cyclone and Flood Management Studies (Total cost Rs592.8 million;&#13;
US$16.3 million equivalent) This sub-component includes carrying out&#13;
of five key studies or activities on long-term hazard reduction,&#13;
developing action plans, setting up of adequate institutional&#13;
arrangements, and the development of an implementation framework.&#13;
These studies/activities include: (i) coastal management including&#13;
rainfall, wind and storm surge modeling, (ii) delta and watershed&#13;
management including water management and flood modeling, (iii)&#13;
cyclone warning, communication and response, awareness raising,&#13;
education and community involvement in hazard reduction activities,&#13;
(iv) development of enhanced design criteria and construction standards&#13;
for use in high risk zones, (v) hazard mapping (derived from coastal&#13;
mapping with 0.5 meter contours), (vi) provision of VHF&#13;
communications, computers and other equipment (according to a&#13;
feasibility study to be completed by May 31, 1997) to the taluka and&#13;
mandal level to enhance the community involvement. The modeling&#13;
studies will require data on floods, rainfall, wind speeds, and so forth.&#13;
Such data are available from agencies such as the IMD, Central Water&#13;
Commission and the state Irrigation Department. It has been agreed that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
it will be the obligation of the GOAP to secure and supply the&#13;
information to the consultants, no later than one month after the&#13;
commencement of the relevant study (at the Inception Report stage).&#13;
Following public participation and debate, the studies would result in the&#13;
development and enforcement of planning regulations for design and&#13;
construction of infrastructure to withstand expected cyclone and flood;&#13;
integrated coastal zone planning and management, including delta and&#13;
flood control structure management; preparedness, emergency response,&#13;
and mitigation and recovery planning; and the mobilization of&#13;
communities to undertake the planning and implementation of hazard&#13;
reduction activities integrated into the developmental activities of the&#13;
districts, talukas and mandals; and the provision of improved&#13;
communications and information technology in the mandals of the State,&#13;
including training for relevant staff in the use and applications of the&#13;
improved communications, facsimile and computer facilities. Major&#13;
civil works for long-term hazard mitigation, however, would not be&#13;
financed under the project. They would be prepared in detail and would&#13;
be available for financing by the GOAP or interested financiers as free-&#13;
standing projects.&#13;
(ii)    Coastal Mapping. (Total cost Rs400.1 million; US$11 million&#13;
equivalent). Completion of the topographic mapping, commenced under&#13;
the CERP, of AP's coastline to 0.5 meter contours, and bathymetric&#13;
mapping of the near shore areas, would be procured to facilitate&#13;
preparation of storm surge analysis, hazard zone mapping, and planning&#13;
of mitigation activities. Base maps required for developing the hazard&#13;
maps are available only from GOI agencies, such as the National&#13;
Remote Sensing Agency, Department of Ocean Development, Survey of&#13;
India and the Geological Survey of India. Mapping would be done by&#13;
one or more of the above agencies or other contractors.&#13;
(iii)   Vulnerability Reduction Fund (Total cost Rs206.4 million; US$5.7&#13;
million equivalent) shall be created by the GOAP as a trust fund for&#13;
hazard reduction activities by affected communities. The GOAP shall&#13;
formulate VRF Charter and define its organization, management and&#13;
operating procedures in agreement with the Bank, prior to July 1, 1997.&#13;
The original endowment of at least US$5 million equivalent shall be&#13;
provided by GOAP no later than October 1, 1997. Additionally, the&#13;
GOAP shall make three more contributions to the fund, each amounting&#13;
to two percent of annual appropriations for infrastructure restoration&#13;
under this project. The additional contributions shall be made by March&#13;
31 in the years 1998, 1999 and 2000. The fund shall retain its&#13;
endowment in perpetuity, investing it in accordance with resource&#13;
management principles of the VRF Charter. Only the investment&#13;
proceeds, i.e., the income generated, shall be used as matching financing&#13;
for hazard reduction activities (see Attachment 4).&#13;
This Fund would be administered by a board of trustees outside of&#13;
government control. The Board will manage the investments through a&#13;
fund manager in accordance with broad guidelines set by GOAP. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
Disaster Management Unit will manage the disbursement of funds to&#13;
communities through the District Disaster Management Committees&#13;
(DDMC), in accordance with criteria acceptable to the Bank. The&#13;
DDMCs will disburse monies to communities on a matching basis, for&#13;
works of not more than Rs500,000 value each. The DDMCs will report&#13;
monthly to the DMU, on their operations. A bi-annual review of&#13;
operations by all the DDMCs will be carried out by the DMU.&#13;
Disbursement of matching financing in excess of Rs500,O00 would&#13;
require prior approval of the DMU. The maximum amount of matching&#13;
financing from the Fund will be limited to Rsl,000,000 for each work.&#13;
The DDMCs would manage and administer the funds approved by the&#13;
Board, develop vulnerability reduction strategies, and mobilize&#13;
enhanced community involvement. Works amenable for community&#13;
works include, inter alia, drain and canal clearing, tank desilting,&#13;
watershed development, reforestation, desilting, clearing sand casting,&#13;
encouragement of diversified livelihood strategies, relocation of&#13;
vulnerable populations, and restoration of livelihoods. Access to the&#13;
Fund will be based on criteria to be agreed with the Bank. Works&#13;
financed out of the Fund would receive a 50 percent matching grant or&#13;
loan.&#13;
(b)    GOI Indian Meteorology Department Activity (7.2 percent of project cost):&#13;
(i)    Enhancement of Early Warning Systems (Total cost Rs571.4 million;&#13;
US$15.7 million equivalent). The India Meteorological Department will&#13;
upgrade six radar facilities on the East coast of India, no later than&#13;
December 31,1999. Under this project, a portion of the equipment&#13;
requirements, including three Doppler radar systems, ten high capacity&#13;
wind speed recorders and 100 cyclone warning dissemination centers,&#13;
would be financed to enhance the early cyclone warning capacity of the&#13;
IMD. Bids will be invited for the three Doppler radar facilities no later&#13;
than June 1, 1998. The IMD will finance the three remaining radar&#13;
facilities with its own funds. The IMD has bids in hand for two Doppler&#13;
radar systems, for which the orders will be placed no later than October&#13;
1, 1997. One other Doppler radar facility being developed by the Indian&#13;
Space Research Organization will also be deployed no later than&#13;
December 31, 1999. The Doppler radars would provide valuable&#13;
information on the velocity structure of tropical cyclones which is&#13;
currently not available and would improve cyclone tracking. The&#13;
Doppler radar capacity would become operational at the six radar sites at&#13;
Calcutta, Paradip, Visakhapatnam, Machilipatnam, Madras, Karaikal.&#13;
Training of technical IMD staff is also included as a crucial instrument&#13;
for building the scientific and technical skills of IMD's operational&#13;
personnel working in the cyclone warning system. IMD technicians and&#13;
scientists will receive training in India and abroad, according to a&#13;
training plan agreed with the Bank.&#13;
31.   II     RESTORATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE (72.1 percent of project cost) This&#13;
component includes the following activities:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
(a)    Electric Power Facilities (Total cost Rs1228.4 million; US$33.7 million&#13;
equivalent). The component will assist the Andhra Pradesh State Electricity&#13;
Board (APSEB) to complete the repair, upgrade and strengthen the network in&#13;
order to mitigate against similar calamities in the future. The component&#13;
includes: strengthening of existing 132 KV and 220 KV transmission lines to&#13;
withstand cyclonic winds and floods experienced in 1996; construction of new&#13;
132 KV and 220 KV transmission lines and substations to improve the reliability&#13;
of supply; provision of standby capacity and augmenting total supply;&#13;
construction of new 33 KV lines with 12.5 meter spun concrete poles to provide&#13;
alternate feed to those 132 KV and 33 KV substations that do not have such&#13;
facility; construction of new 11 KV lines with 9.0 meter spun concrete poles to&#13;
provide each village a reliable feeder to supply essential loads such as pump&#13;
houses, and hospitals; and provision of additional communications facilities to&#13;
reduce reliance on PLCC facilities which become unavailable during power&#13;
failures. APSEB will undertake a review of design and construction standards to&#13;
adopt improved criteria to suit varying hazard vulnerability of the different&#13;
districts. All new 33 KV and 11 KV lines will be routed along road sides to&#13;
provide easier access for repairs during emergencies. A detailed description of&#13;
the component is provided in Attachment 5.&#13;
(b)   Irrigation Drains and Flood Banks. (Total cost Rs1397.6 million; US$38.4&#13;
million equivalent). The component would include: (a) drainage works&#13;
comprising the completion of improvements to minor drains in the six delta&#13;
districts where the major and medium drains were completed during CERP, so&#13;
that drainage of the entire valley and sub-valley is completed under this project;&#13;
rehabilitation of eight major and 23 medium drains in the delta districts to&#13;
improve their capacity; replacement of fourteen masonry structures across main&#13;
drains including three outfall structures at the junction of main drains with the&#13;
Godavari river for effective functioning of the drainage system; and (b) flood&#13;
embankment works, which would comprise the repair and reconstruction of&#13;
damaged and other vulnerable flood embankments in the districts of East and&#13;
West Godavari (Pip, the Gautmi Right and Left banks), Khammam&#13;
(Bhadrachalam) and Warangal (Ramannagudem). New flood banks that involve&#13;
land acquisition will not be financed under the project. See Attachment 6 for&#13;
further details on Irrigation and Drainage.&#13;
The improvement of the drainage network will be done to Indian Standard&#13;
Guidelines (IS Code 8835 of 1978) and criteria agreed and adopted for drainage&#13;
works under the CERP, based on a maximum three day rainfall of 387&#13;
millimeters, with a return period of 25 years. The repair and strengthening of the&#13;
existing flood embankments in Pip, the Gautmi Right and Left banks will be&#13;
done to Indian Standard for River Embankments (IS Code 12094 of 1978) and&#13;
design criteria for flood protection embankment sections as prescribed by the&#13;
Government of India's Central Water Commission. Implementation of the flood&#13;
embankments on the Godavari would commence following further technical&#13;
studies to assess and quantify the effect on the Right bank of the Godavari, its&#13;
effectiveness and suitability in the context of the overall action plan for hazard&#13;
reduction planning, and Bank's prior approval. If the construction involves land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement of people, the construction will not be undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
(c)    State Roads and Bridges. (Total cost Rs1,859.7 million; US$51.1 million&#13;
equivalent). The roads and bridges component comprises both short-term&#13;
recovery and long-term mitigation. Short-term restoration of damaged roads&#13;
would be done through the repair of damaged roads by raising submerged&#13;
sections, building protective walls, revetments for vulnerable sections and&#13;
reconstruction of damaged strategic bridges. Long-term mitigation would be&#13;
addressed through construction of new bridges to connect areas that were totally&#13;
cut off during the cyclone periods, replacing frequently submerged causeways&#13;
with high level bridges, raising of embankments, increasing of waterways,&#13;
construction of additional culverts and drains to improve cross drainage and&#13;
strengthening foundations and superstructures. Road widening requiring land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement of people will not be undertaken. Where road&#13;
widening involves resettlement of people, the relevant stretch will be abandoned&#13;
or the widening will not be done.&#13;
(d)    The above works comprise: 592 kilometers of roads and 27 bridges having a&#13;
total length of 1,834 meters for short-term recovery, and 192 kilometers of roads&#13;
and 19 bridges of total length of 2,115 meters for longer-term hazard reduction.&#13;
Severely damaged road pavements will be strengthened and widened from 3.5&#13;
meters to 5.5 meters, and a few sections will be widened to provide 7.0 meter&#13;
two lane consistent with traffic densities. Hydrology and flood data for design&#13;
would be coordinated with the Irrigation Department. In built up areas, raising of&#13;
road formation, construction of longitudinal drains and concrete pavements&#13;
would be provided. State roads will be designed for a ten year life to Indian&#13;
Road Congress Standards (37: 1984 and 64: 1990) for pavement design, as&#13;
adopted in the last Bank-financed Cyclone Reconstruction Project. Treatment&#13;
proposed will take account of present condition and likely deterioration based&#13;
on realistic maintenance interventions. Roads that are in a bad state of disrepair&#13;
will be built from subgrade to minimize costly bituminous treatment.&#13;
Consultants, satisfactory to the Bank will be engaged no later than January 1,&#13;
1998, to carry out independent design checks and periodic supervision for&#13;
bridges, to assure design and construction quality. If any of the technical studies&#13;
reveal that any displacement will be necessary or that any indigenous people will&#13;
be affected, GOAP will ensure that that R&amp;R should be undertaken in&#13;
accordance with the properly adapted R&amp;R policy which had been agreed for the&#13;
proposed AP III Irrigation Project.&#13;
(e)    Panchayati Raj Roads and Bridges. (Total cost Rs495.9 million; US$13.6&#13;
million equivalent). A network of key rural access and feeder roads that were&#13;
damaged, and where villages were completely cut-off during floods would be&#13;
upgraded under the project. The works would include strengthening or&#13;
reconstruction of causeways and bridges to provide all weather access. No road&#13;
widening would be carried out. Any road works that involve land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement of people will not be financed under this project. Pavement&#13;
construction would comprise waterborne macadam with a 15 mm thick layer of&#13;
premix bitumen. (see Attachment 7).&#13;
(f)    Public Buildings. (Total cost Rs248.0 million; US$6.8 million equivalent).&#13;
Works under this component comprise the repair and reconstruction of collapsed&#13;
or damaged public buildings in fifteen districts. The buildings are mainly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
primary and secondary schools, health centers and hospitals that fall under the&#13;
State and the Panchayati Raj administration. Old buildings of stone and mud&#13;
mortar construction will be reconstructed in the same locations. Buildings of&#13;
more recent construction that primarily suffered roof damage, will be repaired&#13;
through the provision of new roofs of improved design. Roof designs will&#13;
incorporate measures to reduce lift through the provision of shorter eaves, roof&#13;
trusses designed for the appropriate wind loads and suitable anchoring to&#13;
withstand a wind speeds of at least 200 kilometers per hour. The allocation of&#13;
Rs248.0 million will be distributed equally between the State Roads and&#13;
Buildings Department and the Panchayati Raj Department. As school and&#13;
hospital buildings are mostly of standard design, repair of reconstruction will be&#13;
undertaken following review and certification of the design solutions by an&#13;
independent structural engineer, acceptable to the Bank, engaged no later than&#13;
July 1, 1997.&#13;
(g)    Mitigation Works - Watershed Management (Total cost Rs272.9 million;&#13;
US$7.5 million equivalent). This component addresses long-term hazard&#13;
reduction in districts that are vulnerable to infrequent cyclones, high winds, flash&#13;
floods, and sandcasting. People in these critically water starved districts are&#13;
unprepared for the infrequent water-related disasters. Apart from awareness&#13;
raising and education to prepare them for dealing with such disasters, this&#13;
component would promote community watershed management activities for&#13;
hazard reduction. The activities would include: construction of contour bunds,&#13;
micro level check dams, percolation tanks and afforestation and pasture&#13;
development, comprising construction activities that can be undertaken by the&#13;
communities themselves. The method of implementation would follow the same&#13;
approach adopted in the AP Forestry Project's joint forest management program,&#13;
where communities undertake the work through watershed associations. This&#13;
will be part of the vulnerability reduction activities proposed as an integral part&#13;
of the Janmabhoomi program The districts included for this component are&#13;
Nellore, Anantapur, Chittoor, Karimnagar and Adilabad. Details of the&#13;
component are provided in Attachment 8.&#13;
(h)    Mitigation Works - Cyclone Shelters (Total cost Rs9O.2 million; US$2.5&#13;
million equivalent). The cyclone shelters to be constructed under this project&#13;
will have dual use, doubling as school buildings, or any other public use&#13;
requested by the community. The project will provide for the construction of&#13;
about 140 cyclone shelters in areas that frequently experience cyclones, winds&#13;
and storm surge. Though over 800 cyclone shelters have been constructed after&#13;
the 1977 and 1990 cyclones, their utility has been limited where they have been&#13;
constructed primarily as cyclone shelters. These shelters are not maintained&#13;
either by the Panchayats or the community, and they are often in a dilapidated&#13;
condition. Following the 1990 cyclone an L-shaped shelter was constructed&#13;
which was vastly superior to the circular shelters. Construction of the cyclone&#13;
shelters will be carried out following agreement with the Bank on the design and&#13;
functions for which it will be put at non-emergency times.&#13;
(i)    Mitigation Works- TreeShelterBelts (Total cost Rsl 12.7 million; US$3.1&#13;
million equivalent). The project will finance the continuing GOAP program of&#13;
shelter belt plantation up to 2 kilometers from the shore line. This would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
comprise planting of casuarina equestifolia up to 500 meters from the shore line&#13;
including harvesting plantations that have reached maturity, mangrove&#13;
plantations in the estuarine and backwater areas, and afforestation in areas&#13;
beyond 500 meters, with the aim of providing tree crops for the use of the&#13;
community. No land acquisition will be required for this activity.&#13;
32.   IH    TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE to be financed under the project includes incremental&#13;
operating costs, consultancies, training and equipment, as detailed below:&#13;
(a)    Incremental Operating Costs (2.5 percent of project cost: Total cost Rs202.9&#13;
million; US$5.6 million equivalent). Provision has been made in the project&#13;
costs to finance incremental operating costs of project management and&#13;
implementation, on a sliding scale, starting with 80 percent in the first year, 60&#13;
percent in the second year, and 25 percent in the third year. Expenditures eligible&#13;
for reimbursement out of the proceeds of the Loan/Credit would include fees and&#13;
salaries of staff hired for or fully dedicated to project management and&#13;
implementation activities, including the costs of the Disaster Management Unit.&#13;
(b)    Consultancies, Training and Equipment (4.5 percent of project cost: Total cost&#13;
Rs329.2 million; US$9.0 million equivalent) component (other than Hazard&#13;
Management Program) includes:&#13;
(i)    Consultancies (other than hazard management studies), which entail&#13;
financing of consultants for conducting design checks, quality assurance&#13;
and certification, technical audit and other project management&#13;
activities.&#13;
(ii)    Training includes capacity building of: (i) the GOAP agencies to&#13;
respond efficiently to cyclone and flood disasters; public education&#13;
campaigns, awareness raising and disaster planning information;&#13;
cyclone-resistant low-cost housing design development; training of&#13;
population at risk in adequate house construction techniques; facilitating&#13;
the involvement of governments, CBOs, NGOs and the public at large in&#13;
disaster management planning (community participation, e.g. via&#13;
Janmabhoomi); a provision of US$200,000 has been made in the project&#13;
for training of GOAP officials in the fields of hazard management (for&#13;
DMU, R&amp;B Department and SADA), flood modeling (for the Irrigation&#13;
Department), and hazard mapping and other applications (for APSRAC);&#13;
and (ii) IMD will provide training for its scientists and technicians in the&#13;
fields of modeling and early warning techniques and in the operation of&#13;
the early warning facilities, in accordance with a training plan to be&#13;
prepared no later than September 1, 1997 (a provision of US$150,000&#13;
has been for this purpose). The first overseas training of IMD staff will&#13;
commence no later than March 1, 1998.&#13;
(iii)   Equipment would be provided for (i) setting up of an extensive VHF&#13;
communications network in the flood and cyclone-prone districts, (ii) an&#13;
information network for raising awareness and mobilizing people for&#13;
hazard reduction activities, (iii) facsimile and computers and associated&#13;
software in the mandals of the state, and (iv) vehicles and other office&#13;
equipment needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
PROJECT COST AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
33.    The total estimated project cost is Rs8,007.9 million (US$220 million equivalent)&#13;
inclusive of physical and price contingencies, with a foreign exchange component of US$79.5&#13;
million. Taxes and duties are estimated at about US$33 million (15 percent of total project&#13;
costs). Base costs have been determined on costs estimated at February 1997 prices. Table I -&#13;
Summary Project Costs, indicates total component cost inclusive of physical and price&#13;
contingencies, in Rupees and US Dollars, and the local and foreign component breakdown.&#13;
Detailed project costs, including phasing are given in the Attachment 3.&#13;
34.    The Loan/Credit would finance US$150 million (68 percent) of total project cost net of&#13;
taxes and duties. The Loan would be US$50 million and the Credit would be SDR 72.1 million&#13;
(US$ 100 million equivalent). The GOAP would finance US$66.9 million (30 percent) of project&#13;
cost, and GOI, through the budget of IMD, would finance US$3.1 million (2 percent) of project&#13;
cost. Parallel financing of about US$30 million has been agreed with NABARD to finance minor&#13;
irrigation works and rural roads. The AP State Electricity Board has received a loan of about&#13;
US$30 million to finance immediate restoration works of the electricity facilities. No Project&#13;
Preparation Facility nor trust funds have been used in project preparation.&#13;

Section D: HAZARD REDUCTION STUDIES, OTHER CONSULTANCIES, TRAINING&#13;
AND EQUIPMENT&#13;
35.    A range of relevant baseline studies for the development of useful hazard maps to&#13;
delineate hazard zones indicating frequency and intensity of "design" events would be&#13;
undertaken by the GOAP, through the proposed Disaster Management Unit (see Section E). The&#13;
disaster management function is necessarily multi-hazard oriented, as it has to be designed to&#13;
address the set of hazards impacting the whole state, particularly cyclones, floods, storm surges&#13;
and droughts. The following studies/activities related to hazard reduction would be carried out&#13;
under the proposed project: (i) integrated coastal zone management including wind, rainfall and&#13;
storm surge modeling; (ii) delta and watershed management, including flood modeling and water&#13;
management; (iii) coastal (topographic and bathymetric) mapping of land and near shore areas to&#13;
0.5 meter contours, for preparation of hazard maps; (iv) hazard mapping; (v) development of&#13;
enhanced design standards and construction practices in high risk areas; (v) cyclone warning,&#13;
communication and response, and awareness raising, education and community involvement in&#13;
hazard reduction activities. The results of these studies and associated technical assistance will&#13;
address the fundamental issues of hazard exposure of AP and will provide the basis for an&#13;
efficient, comprehensive multi-hazard mitigation and response capacity. Accordingly, three&#13;
disaster management products will be developed on the basis of these studies: (i) comprehensive&#13;
vulnerability assessment; (ii) operational disaster response; and (iii) a statewide disaster&#13;
mitigation strategy.&#13;
36.   Other project management and implementation related technical assistance to be funded&#13;
under the project include: (i) consultancy for quality assurance and certification; (ii) consultancy&#13;
for design checks of bridges and periodic supervision; (iii) consultancy for technical audit of&#13;
interventions at the taluka and mandal levels; (iv) consultancies for design checks and periodic&#13;
supervision of large bridges, and for design of public buildings; (v) consultancy for setting up&#13;
Vulnerability Reduction Fund; (vi) specialist consultants for the Disaster Management Unit; (vi)&#13;
consultancy for developing cyclone-resistant house designs; (vi) training of functionaries at the&#13;
taluka and mandal level; (vii) study tours and workshops for training in hazard management;&#13;
(viii) VHF and other communications systems to link up vulnerable villages; (ix) equipment for&#13;
upgrading AP Remote Sensing Applications Center; (x) computers, software, and office&#13;
equipment for the taluka and mandal centers; and (xi) training, in India and abroad, for IMD's&#13;
technicians and scientists in the maintenance of the early warning systems, and in modeling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
SecEton EISITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJ1ECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
POLICY FRAMEWORK&#13;
37.    The GOAP has an Emergency Response and Recovery Plan to deal with evacuation and&#13;
the immediate aftermath of annual cyclones, wind, storm surge and floods. The plan has been&#13;
tested over a number of years, working reasonably well as the reduction in the death toll after the&#13;
most recent disasters indicates. Short-term relief operations and recovery activities have also&#13;
improved over the years. However, the property and financial loss due to natural disasters&#13;
continue to grow, while the GOAP has not sufficient capacity to deal effectively with long term&#13;
mitigation issues. As part of the project formulation, the GOAP has prepared a draft policy&#13;
framework (to be revised) stating concretely its approach to (i) natural hazard reduction,&#13;
including short, medium and long-term measures, as the strategy for dealing with the frequently&#13;
occurring disasters; (ii) community involvement, including strategies for peoples' mobilization&#13;
to share capital costs and maintenance of community assets, and possible links to existing&#13;
community participation schemes such as Janmabhoomi; and (iii) project implementation&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD&#13;
38.   As specified by the Bank's guidelines for emergency recovery assistance, the project&#13;
would be implemented over a three year period. The closing date of the Loan/Credit will be July&#13;
31, 2000.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT&#13;
39.    The lack of long-term hazard management planning and control has led to a number of&#13;
environmental problems in the coastal districts. These include: the denudation of forest cover&#13;
along the coast due to widespread aquaculture activities; insufficient development control&#13;
leading to construction on natural waterways; encroachment on natural water bodies, such as the&#13;
Kolleru Lake, near Wijayawada; the siting of infrastructure without consideration of hazard&#13;
risks; and the lack of maintenance of infrastructure assets, such as roads and the irrigation canal&#13;
and drainage system in the delta areas.&#13;
40.    The project is classified as a category B project according to the World Bank&#13;
Operational Directive (OD) 4.01 on Environmental Assessment, and it does not require a full&#13;
environmental assessment. Instead, environmental screening will be undertaken for core&#13;
infrastructure, namely, electric power facilities, roads and bridges, irrigation works, and public&#13;
buildings. Although the project deals with mitigation of future hazards and restoration of existing&#13;
facilities, the extent to which the disaster was precipitated and exacerbated by unsuitable&#13;
environmental practices would be taken into account and corrective measures would be built into&#13;
restoration of infrastructure. Special provisions would be built into the terms of reference for&#13;
consultants engaged for infrastructure restoration, to ensure that environmental screening would&#13;
lead to the implementation of mitigation activities. Where consultants are not used for the bulk&#13;
of infrastructure restoration, the DMU will ensure that all implementing agencies undertake&#13;
environmental screening, according to the terms of reference agreed with the Bank, prior to start&#13;
of implementation of each sub-component. If the environmental screening identifies a potentially&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
negative environmental impact, DMU would require that implementing agency undertake&#13;
additional studies, using consultants, to prepare a mitigation plan for the consideration of the&#13;
DMU. If approved, the implementing agency would carry out the proposed mitigation measures.&#13;
In the case of severe negative environmental impacts, the DMU will consult the Department of&#13;
Environment and Forests for their advice (see Attachment 17).&#13;
41.   Works that involve land acquisition and resettlement of people will not be undertaken in&#13;
this project. The GOAP has standard arrangements to deal with the encroachers of objectionable&#13;
lands. The arrangements include people voluntarily moving any structures they may have erected&#13;
(usually associated with seasonal agricultural activities) while drain cleaning or other repair&#13;
works go on, and return to their original locations upon completion of the works. If loss of any&#13;
crops is involved, it is compensated. In view of the fact that GOAP has a procedure in place to&#13;
deal with such situations and that these procedures are being implemented when necessary, the&#13;
Bank review found them satisfactory.&#13;
42.   The construction of new flood banks in the delta region will be undertaken only&#13;
following model studies including land acquisition assessment, which are yet to begin. If it is&#13;
determined that the above or other works involve resettlement of people, such works will not be&#13;
financed from the proceeds of the Loan/Credit.&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
43.   Institutional arrangements for a comprehensive, long-term disaster management program&#13;
in Andhra Pradesh would be developed on three levels: (a) policy: the AP Disaster Mitigation&#13;
Council; (b) technical: the AP Disaster Management Unit; and (c) community: District (Taluka&#13;
and Mandal) Disaster Management Committee. This framework would be put in place&#13;
immediately and operationalized as soon as possible for start of project implementation. The&#13;
DMU would also provide a basic structure for implementation of the proposed project and&#13;
preparation of the AP hazard management program. The three year project implementation is&#13;
envisaged as the period for the development of a fully-fledged state disaster management&#13;
program.&#13;
(a)    AP Disaster Mitigation Council (APDMC) would be created, with Chief&#13;
Minister as the chairman, and will have key ministers and prominent figures&#13;
from public life as members. The Council will set the policy agenda for long-&#13;
term hazard reduction in the State, conduct periodic reviews and approve long-&#13;
term hazard reduction action plans, respond to any new natural disaster in the&#13;
state in a manner consistent with the declared policy, and review reports on the&#13;
progress in implementation of the action plans. In conformity with his state-wide&#13;
Janmabhoomi community participation initiative, Chief Minister can&#13;
additionally provide leadership for mobilization of communities to take part in&#13;
hazard reduction of elements of infrastructure that have a direct impact on their&#13;
economic activities. For example, communal "ownership" of maintenance and&#13;
cleaning minor and medium canals and drains (either through self-help or&#13;
through the employment of small contractors) lend themselves well to the&#13;
community participation concept of the proposed project.&#13;
(b)   AP Disaster Management Unit (DMU) would be created in the Department of&#13;
Finance and Planning, under the Secretary of Finance as the head, but would be&#13;
managed by a full-time Project Director. The Unit would be a permanent body,&#13;
and would be responsible for managing the development of the hazard&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
management program initially, in addition to managing and coordinating&#13;
implementation of the infrastructure restoration program. The DMU would be&#13;
responsible for managing: hazard mapping, development of action plans for&#13;
hazard reduction, development of standards for construction, siting and&#13;
monitoring, hazard mitigation, damage assessment, inspection and enforcement,&#13;
public information and training, and environmental monitoring. The Unit would&#13;
have the responsibility for the management of the project, inter-departmental&#13;
coordination, management of hazard reduction related consultant studies, and for&#13;
the planning and development of long-term hazard reduction action plans for the&#13;
state. Initially, the Unit would have a skeletal staff comprising a&#13;
communications expert for community outreach activities, a disaster&#13;
management expert, a transport engineer, an irrigation engineer and an&#13;
environmental specialist. Other specialist experts, such as wind experts will be&#13;
retained on an as needed basis. The Unit would be gradually staffed as its&#13;
activities expand. DMU will use the services of the Shore Area Development&#13;
Authority (SADA) and/or the Environmental Protection Training and Research&#13;
Institute (EPTRI) in Hyderabad to assess the potential environmental impacts,&#13;
conduct required environmental analyses, and propose any needed&#13;
environmental mitigation. All technical and administrative sanctions for civil&#13;
works shall contain a note indicating that the required environmental screening&#13;
and the resultant environmental mitigation requirements have been addressed&#13;
satisfactorily and the cost for these works is included in the proposal. Details on&#13;
the environmental screening process with an analytical checklist and&#13;
environmental analysis are provided in Attachment 17.&#13;
At the end of three years, DMU would become the lead unit for planning and&#13;
management of long-term hazard mitigation activities in Andhra Pradesh. The&#13;
Unit would use the services of the existing PMU in the Department of Finance&#13;
for procurement and disbursement functions and the AP Remote Sensing and&#13;
Applications Center for specialized services. It would collaborate with the&#13;
Disaster Management Center at the Rural Development Academy in Hyderabad,&#13;
Center for Disaster Management, GOI, and agencies in other states where&#13;
similar activities are being undertaken, such as YASHADA's Disaster&#13;
Management Center in Pune, Maharashtra. All funds for the project activities&#13;
would be appropriated under a separate head in the Ministry of Finance and&#13;
would be passed on to the respective sector departments for project&#13;
implementation according to their needs, and on recommendations of the DMU.&#13;
The DMU would undertake programs to mobilize NGO and private sector&#13;
support for hazard reduction activities, as well as for special initiatives in&#13;
insurance and investment. Hazard reduction action plans would be implemented&#13;
by the state sector departments and communities themselves, as described&#13;
below. Further details on the DMU are provided in Attachment 10.&#13;
(c)    District Disaster Management Committee (DDMC) as well as taluka, mandal&#13;
and village level committees, would be organized to institutionalize community&#13;
involvement in hazard reduction. DDMC would be chaired by the Collector, and&#13;
would include, inter alia, the Joint Collector, the CEO Zilla Parishad, the&#13;
APRSAC district representative and the District Public Relations Officer. Sub-&#13;
district organization on the mandal and village levels would be structured on a&#13;
similar basis, to reflect the importance of public participation and understanding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
of natural disaster reduction. The DDMCs will be responsible for organizing ant-&#13;
monitoring community -based hazard reduction activities, as well as administer&#13;
allocations approved from the Vulnerability Reduction fund.&#13;
(d)    Community Managed Works in Hazard Reduction. Current cash hand-outs in&#13;
response to losses are one-off events that contribute little to enhance community&#13;
resilience against future disasters. Simultaneously, the funds available for&#13;
maintenance of vital infrastructure have become less adequate, and&#13;
responsibility for maintenance of even minor irrigation works has devolved out&#13;
of the hands of the primary beneficiaries - the communities for which the&#13;
infrastructure has been created in the first place. While it has become&#13;
increasingly difficult for the government to cover routine operations and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) costs because of budgetary restrictions, the people, for a&#13;
variety of reasons, have chosen to surrender their own responsibilities for&#13;
maintenance to government agencies. A situation of enhanced dependency has&#13;
arisen where the people have come to rely on government for all kinds of&#13;
assistance. In the end, local users do not perceive these assets as their own and&#13;
do not feel committed to their long-term maintenance - a major source of&#13;
increased vulnerability.&#13;
The departments responsible for maintaining communal assets have generally&#13;
operated in isolation from the public, relying on their own expertise to provide&#13;
solutions which citizens are expected to accept with very little questioning.&#13;
Projects are undertaken for people rather than with people. To foster sustainable&#13;
mitigation processes at the local level, much more that the simple physical&#13;
rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure is required. A concerted effort to link&#13;
rehabilitation to long term mitigation plans which involve local communities in&#13;
more systematic and effective ways is called for under the project's mitigation&#13;
objectives. This objective reinforces the current emphases by the State to&#13;
increase citizens' self-reliance and involvement in the decisions that affect their&#13;
lives directly. It also implies the development of an integrated approach to the&#13;
provision of infrastructure which includes all the stakeholders in the elaboration&#13;
and development of sustainable options - both public and private, governmental&#13;
and non-governmental. Along with coordination of activities at all levels - from&#13;
sub-mandal micro-planning to State-wide integrated planning - it is also&#13;
necessary to give a more central involvement to citizens and their organizations,&#13;
including NGOs, CBOs, and so forth. While it is unlikely that people have the&#13;
expertise to execute and maintain large infrastructure investments, they do have&#13;
a central role to play in the maintenance of local physical assets.&#13;
As part of the long-term mitigation objectives of the project, vulnerability&#13;
reduction would become an integral part of community level development&#13;
activities in AP. The aim should be to associate the execution of physical works&#13;
more closely with the local context in which they are prioritized. The project&#13;
will focus on the incorporation of community in the widest sense (CBOs, NGOs.&#13;
the private sector) into long-term disaster mitigation planning and to marry such&#13;
planning with the on-going developmental activities at State, district and sub-&#13;
district levels. The aim would be to enhance local ownership of public assets,&#13;
build up expertise and strengthen existing institutions in the pursuit of more&#13;
sustainable development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
Where repair and maintenance of canals and drains has been deficient, and when&#13;
this impacts directly their economic activities, agricultural communities in AP&#13;
have shown a willingness to contribute towards the cost of such repairs and&#13;
maintenance. Additionally, recent initiatives led by the Chief Minister of AP&#13;
have been directed to mobilizing people to undertake various activities in their&#13;
communities either on a 100 percent voluntary basis or on community&#13;
contributions of up to 50 percent, for which matching funds are provided by the&#13;
government. For one of this initiatives, Sramadanam ("community works")&#13;
under the Janmabhoomi program (see Attachment  11), Rs2,000 million has been&#13;
budgeted for the FY 97/98. Building upon these programs, communities would&#13;
be mobilized under the project to carry out hazard reduction activities for&#13;
maintenance of infrastructure elements that are basic to their social and&#13;
economic activities, and particularly those related to maintenance of minor&#13;
drains, as well as watershed and joint forest management. The proceeds of the&#13;
Vulnerability Reduction Fund would also be used to finance activities directly&#13;
linked to hazard reduction. This would be compatible with the community works&#13;
included in Sramadanam, which focuses on collective village and ward cleaning&#13;
and general village cleanliness, including cleaning of drains, dealing with water&#13;
stagnation, repairs to drinking water sources, garbage disposal and maintenance&#13;
of trees.&#13;
Works under the project may be carried out either by the communities or sector&#13;
departments upon receipt of the beneficiary contribution (of up to 50 percent).&#13;
Provision exists for District Collectors to award piece work or work order&#13;
contracts for small works, such as minor irrigation drain cleaning, valued at less&#13;
than Rs200,000 each contract. This initiative is being used to encourage&#13;
community involvement by matching half the cost contributed by the&#13;
community. Additionally, GOAP passes on funds, amounting to RsI00,000 at a&#13;
time to community cooperatives for activities such as watershed management&#13;
and joint forest management under the AP Forestry Project. GOAP would&#13;
supervise works done by the community through the respective sector&#13;
departments to ensure that sound engineering standards are followed.&#13;
(e)    The Vulnerability Reduction Fund (VRF) shall be created by the GOAP as a&#13;
trust fund for hazard reduction activities by affected communities. The GOAP&#13;
shall formulate VRF Charter and define its organization, management and&#13;
operating procedures in agreement with the Bank, prior to July 1, 1997. The&#13;
original endowment of at least US$ 5 million equivalent shall be provided by&#13;
GOAP no later than October 1, 1997. Additionally, the GOAP shall make three&#13;
more contributions to the fund, each amounting to two percent of annual&#13;
appropriations for infrastructure restoration under this project. The additional&#13;
contributions shall be made by March 31 in the years 1998, 1999 and 2000. The&#13;
fund shall retain its endowment in perpetuity, investing it in accordance with&#13;
resource management principles of the VRF Charter. Only the investment&#13;
proceeds, i.e., the income generated, shall be used as matching financing for&#13;
hazard reduction activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
FLOW OF FUNDS&#13;
44.    One hundred percent of the proceeds of the Loan/Credit will be passed on to the&#13;
Government of Andhra Pradesh, by the Government of India, on the standard terms of assistance&#13;
to the states. The GOAP will appropriate funds for the proposed project to a separate head under&#13;
the Department of Finance and Planning, which will pass on the project funds to the spending&#13;
departments on the recommendations of the DMU.&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
45.   Project Implementing Agencies. The AP Disaster Management Unit will have overall&#13;
responsibility for project implementation. It will engage additional specialist assistance to&#13;
supervise project implementation, so that there is greater ownership and the Bank inputs to&#13;
project supervision could be minimized. The DMU will be responsible for carrying out all hazard&#13;
mitigation studies, developing action plans, mobilizing community involvement in hazard&#13;
reduction, and developing the institutional and regulatory framework for long-term hazard&#13;
reduction. The DMU will also maintain consolidated project accounts, monitor progress and&#13;
report to the GOAP and the Bank, as required. Implementation of infrastructure sub-sectors&#13;
would be carried out by the respective agencies, namely AP State Electricity Board (APSEB) for&#13;
electric power facilities; Irrigation Department for drains and flood banks; Roads and Bridges&#13;
Department for State roads and bridges, and State buildings; Panchayati Raj Department for rural&#13;
roads, cyclone shelters and PR buildings; the District Rural Development Agency for watershed&#13;
management; the AP Forestry Department for tree shelter belts; and the Indian Meteorology&#13;
Department for early warning systems. On behalf of the GOAP, the DMU will organize the&#13;
preparation of coastal mapping, and subsequently zonal hazard mapping. Apart from the DMU,&#13;
which is a new agency, all other agencies are well experienced in their respective activities, and&#13;
have the capacity to undertake the works under the project. The infrastructure departments&#13;
specifically, have spare capacity due to the downturn in investment activities that have resulted&#13;
from the State's fiscal difficulties over the last two to three years.&#13;
46.   Project Implementation Plan. The PIP prepared by the GOAP will be further refined to&#13;
include all activities including the hazard reduction studies and training. The PIP at present&#13;
concentrates on infrastructure components and their procur^-ment plans. The revised PIP would&#13;
contain: project management arrangements including financing; implementation plans of each&#13;
sector department including the hazard reduction activities conducted by the DMU;&#13;
implementation arrangements for the IMD component; training plans for GOAP and IMD staff;&#13;
and procurement plans for each activity indicating the type of procurement, details of contract&#13;
packages and the scheduling of contracts. Final PIP is expected to be ready by the end of April,&#13;
1997.&#13;
47.    Enhanced Design Criteria. Convincing evidence exists that all infrastructure that was&#13;
constructed to enhanced design standards under the last Cyclone Reconstruction Project was able&#13;
to withstand the intensities of cyclones, wind, and floods that occurred during the past year.&#13;
Infrastructure repaired or reconstructed under this project will be done to enhanced standards&#13;
which will be subject to be review and approval by the Bank. Such enhanced standards are&#13;
available for electricity services and roads (see Attachment 12). Higher standards of design&#13;
would be developed or adopted for roads and bridges, electric power facilities, irrigation&#13;
facilities, public buildings, and emergency shelters. Design criteria proposed to be used in the&#13;
repair and reconstruction of infrastructure under the project have been agreed with GOAP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
Enhanced design standards to be used for each infrastructure sub-sector would include an&#13;
environmental screening process, identifying components requiring environmental analysis and&#13;
possible mitigation measures. Design, siting and construction of irrigation structures and flood&#13;
banks that are dependent on the findings of the technical studies will be undertaken only after the&#13;
above mentioned factors have been confirmed and verified.&#13;
48.    Design and Construction Criteria, Quality Assurance and Certification. Reconstruction&#13;
of infrastructure would only be done when design features are incorporated to ensure that the&#13;
structures can withstand the intensities of expected cyclones and floods. Internationally&#13;
experienced quality assurance consultants would be appointed to undertake random supervision&#13;
across all sub-sectors to assure design and construction quality and to ensure that works&#13;
undertaken meet the project objectives. These consultants would certify that the works have been&#13;
constructed to the specified standards. This control effort will not substitute for the normal&#13;
superintendence that is normally provided by the implementing agencies, as quality assurance&#13;
checks will be done on no more than about 10 to 15 percent of the total works. Simultaneously,&#13;
these consultants would assist the GOAP in building their own institutional capacity to enforce&#13;
design and construction standards in the long-term.&#13;
49.    TechnicalAudit. Substantial effort will be directed towards establishing communication&#13;
and technological facilities at the taluka and mandal levels for communities to participate in&#13;
hazard reduction activities, awareness raising, education, and micro level planning which will be&#13;
fully integrated into everyday community life. These funds have been provided for setting up of&#13;
communications, computer hardware and software, and for training of functionaries. The GOAP&#13;
has agreed that a technical audit will be carried out every six months to assess the use of&#13;
facilities provided, training of functionaries, the delivery of outputs, such village databases,&#13;
micro level plans, communities taking over simple infrastructure assets, and communities&#13;
contributing to maintenance of infrastructure that have a direct linkage to their economic&#13;
activities. The results of the audit will be used at the mid-term review to introduce appropriate&#13;
changes to the program. The project would finance the consultants that would undertake this&#13;
technical audit.&#13;
50.   Mid-Term Review. A mid-term review will be held in December 1998, to assess (i)&#13;
whether the project objectives are likely to be achieved; (ii) the commitment and actions of the&#13;
GOI towards timely enhancement of the early warning system in the jurisdiction of the Indian&#13;
Meteorological Department; (ii) the commitment and actions of the GOAP towards instituting&#13;
regulations and enforcement of incentives/disincentives to reduce hazards; (iv) the overall&#13;
progress made in the infrastructure restoration program; (v) the robustness of the community&#13;
participation programs including the involvement of women; and (vi) the need for any changes&#13;
or restructuring of the project.&#13;
51.   Performance Indicators. Full list and discussion of project monitoring indicators is&#13;
presented in Attachment 14 and it will be used by the implementing agencies for progress&#13;
monitoring. A selected list of performance monitoring indicators will be agreed with GOAP and&#13;
IMD at the time of project launch. Two types of performance monitoring indicators will be&#13;
utilized for monitoring the progress in implementation of the proposed project: (i) program&#13;
performance indicators, which would allow to measure progress made toward the fulfillment of&#13;
the stated short- medium- and long-term mitigation and recovery objectives, as described for&#13;
each of the proposed project components; and (ii) project performance indicators, which would&#13;
monitor procurement procedures, contract preparation and approval, and general disbursement&#13;
issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
PROCUREMENT&#13;
52.   ProcurementManagement. Procurement management will be done through three&#13;
instruments: (a) Procurement plan. (b) Fully empowered Committee of Secretaries which has&#13;
been created with powers to deal with procurement decisions irrespective of their value. This&#13;
Committee will comprise of the Project Director of the DMU, Secretary (Works and Projects,&#13;
Department of Finance) and the concerned sector department Secretary. The Committee will&#13;
meet as and when necessary, but at least once in ten days, to ensure that decisions on award of&#13;
contracts are taken within the period of initial validity (see Attachment 13 for details on powers&#13;
and responsibilities of the Committee of Secretaries and Chief Engineers). (c) Chief Engineers,&#13;
whose financial threshold for procurement decisions would be raised to allow them to accept&#13;
bids of up to 40 percent above cost estimates. The GOAP has issued all the necessary&#13;
government orders, prior to negotiations, for the above arrangements. The sector department&#13;
Chief Engineers will be responsible for all procurement activities up to the financial powers&#13;
prescribed for them. The existing Project Management Unit (PMU) will provide necessary&#13;
support to the DMU for procurement administration. Where procurement decisions exceed the&#13;
prescribed powers of Chief Engineers, the sector departments will process these matters through&#13;
the Project Director, DMU, who will obtain clearance from the Committee of Secretaries.&#13;
53.   Procurement Procedures for Works. Procurement of works would be done in&#13;
accordance with World Bank Guidelines. The following procedures will be applied: (i) standard&#13;
bidding documents approved for use in India, will be used without exception; (ii) due to the&#13;
relatively small size and the wide spatial distribution of civil works, all civil works costing more&#13;
than US$25,000 equivalent each, and up to an aggregate value of US$101.3 million, will be&#13;
procured using national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank; (iii) civil&#13;
works contracts costing less than US$25,000 equivalent each, up to an aggregate value of US$25&#13;
million, will be procured using other procedures, including direct contracting, through NGOs or&#13;
communities, or on the basis of three price quotations, or under unit rate/piece rate system. Such&#13;
works would include: small works of an emergency nature, or small works carried out by&#13;
through community contributions or through NGOs or using community labor; (iv) force account&#13;
procedures, up to an aggregate value of US$2 million, will be used only in the last resort with the&#13;
approval of the Bank.&#13;
54.   Procurement Procedures for Materials, Equipment and Vehicles. Contracts for&#13;
materials, equipment and vehicles costing more than US$200,000 equivalent each, up to an&#13;
aggregate value of US$ 38 million, will be procured under international competitive bidding&#13;
procedures. Contracts for materials, equipment and vehicles, valued less than US$200,000&#13;
equivalent each and more than US$25,000 in value each, up to an aggregate value of US$11.1&#13;
million, will be procured following the NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. National&#13;
shopping procedures will be used for the procurement of equipment, materials and vehicles&#13;
costing less than US$25,000 equivalent each, up to an aggregate value of US$1 million&#13;
equivalent.&#13;
55.   Procurement of Consultant Services. As arrangements for procurement of consultants&#13;
for two studies (i.e., coastal zone management, and delta and watershed management) are well&#13;
advanced, and the Bank and GOAP had agreed in December 1996 on the procedures to be used,&#13;
all consultant services for these two studies will be procured in accordance with Guidelines for&#13;
the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
(August 1981). Procurement of all other consultants services will be undertaken according to the&#13;
Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997).&#13;
Consultant contracts valued at less than US$ 50,000 equivalent each for individuals, or&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent each for firms, up to an aggregate value of US$2 million equivalent,&#13;
would be procured using sole source procedures. Coastal mapping, estimated to cost not more&#13;
than US$ 10 million and available only through the Government of India's agencies (e.g.,&#13;
National Remote Sensing Agency, Survey of India, Department of Geological Survey and&#13;
Department of Ocean Development) will be procured through sole source procedures acceptable&#13;
to the Bank.&#13;
56.    Prior Review Requirements. The World Bank's prior review and approval will be&#13;
required for bid documents, bid evaluations and award decisions for: works estimated to cost&#13;
US$ 300,000 equivalent or more, and contracts for groups of materials, equipment and vehicles&#13;
estimated to cost US$ 200,000 equivalent or more will be required. Consultant contracts valued&#13;
at US$ 100,000 for firms and US$ 50,000 for individuals and all sole source consultancies,&#13;
including terms of reference for all consultancies will be subject to prior review.&#13;
57.    Estimating of Costs. The use of out of date schedules of rates for preparing cost&#13;
estimates has frequently been cited as the reason for delays in contract awards, because of the&#13;
need to justify and obtain approvals from higher authorities. As the FY 97/98 schedule of rates&#13;
would not be ready until September 1997, the GOAP has instructed all sector departments to&#13;
update the FY 96/97 schedule by adding the average of the increase in the rates for the past three&#13;
years, for use in preparing cost estimates. In addition, GOAP has agreed to hire consultants to&#13;
assist in the streamlining of schedule of rates and procedures for their compilation, to suit current&#13;
construction methodologies and labor output, under the proposed AP III Irrigation Project.&#13;
GOAP should complete this updating in stages giving priority to the bill items of work taken up&#13;
in this Project. The GOAP gave assurances that the updating of the schedule of rates will be&#13;
completed in one year.&#13;
58.    Procurement Monitoring. Procurement information will be collected and recorded as&#13;
follows: (a) prompt reporting of contract award information by the Borrower; (b)&#13;
comprehensive quarterly reports to the Bank, by the Borrower, indicating: (i) revised cost&#13;
estimates for individual contracts and the total project; (ii) revised timing of procurement&#13;
actions, including advertising, bidding, contract award and completion time for individual&#13;
contracts; (iii) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement; and (iv)&#13;
a completion report by the Borrower within three months of the loan/credit closing.&#13;
59.    To the extent practicable, vehicles required for the project will be hired at rates fixed in&#13;
accordance with the GOAP procedures acceptable to the Bank. This item of expenditure will be&#13;
eligible for disbursement under incremental operating costs, on a sliding scale.&#13;
DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
60.   Disbursement Categories and Percentages. The proceeds of the Loan/Credit would be&#13;
disbursed against eligible expenditures at the following percentages: 70 percent of expenditures&#13;
for civil works, 100 percent of foreign expenditures for materials, equipment and vehicles, 100&#13;
percent of local ex-factory expenditures for materials, equipment and vehicles, 80 percent of&#13;
local expenditures for other materials, equipment and vehicles procured locally, and 100 percent&#13;
for consultant services and training. Expenditures in respect of incremental operating costs for&#13;
project management and implementation will be financed on a sliding scale starting at 80 percent&#13;
in the first year, sliding down to 60 percent in the second year and to 25 percent in the third year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
Technical assistance funds earmarked for the hazard management studies and coastal mapping&#13;
will not be re-allocated for any other purpose, and any unused funds will be canceled. However,&#13;
if GOAP receives coastal maps, with 0.5 meter contours, at a lower cost or as a grant, the Bank&#13;
may consider re-allocating such funds for other uses.&#13;
61.   Retroactive Financing. The GOAP has incurred expenditure for over US$40 million for&#13;
infrastructure restoration following the cyclone, some of which could be eligible for&#13;
reimbursement from the proceeds of the Loan/Credit. These works have been procured using&#13;
national competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank. Retroactive financing will be&#13;
provided for eligible expenditures, of not more than US$ 15 million equivalent, incurred after&#13;
November 6, 1996 - the date of the major cyclone.&#13;
62.   SpecialAccount. To facilitate project implementation, a Special Account would be&#13;
established in US Dollars at the Reserve Bank of India with an initial deposit of US$ 12.5&#13;
million, equivalent to not more than four months average projected expenditures, from which all&#13;
eligible project expenditures would be disbursed. The Government of India will advance to the&#13;
GOAP central assistance every year, for the life of the project and in accordance with the&#13;
procedures established between GOI and the states for this purpose. The GOAP will make&#13;
similar advances to the implementing agencies promptly after such releases through setting up&#13;
letters of credit, release of funds and government orders, in accordance with standard procedures&#13;
for financing state expenditure.&#13;
63.   Statement of Expenditures. Disbursements against civil works contracts of value less&#13;
than US$300,000 equivalent, contracts for materials, equipment and vehicles of value under&#13;
US$200,000 equivalent, and consultant contracts valued at less than US$100,000 each, training&#13;
and incremental operating costs, would be made against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). All&#13;
other disbursements will be made against full documentation.&#13;
64.   Accounts andAudits. Project accounts would be maintained according to the following&#13;
guidelines:&#13;
(a)    The project accounts would be maintained under a separate heading and&#13;
appropriate sub-headings by each department or agency. The accounts prepared&#13;
by each participating department/agency will be consolidated by the DMU to&#13;
form project accounts. Each department/agency would submitted to the DMU&#13;
required documentation for all non-SOE expenditures, and retain the necessary&#13;
documentation for all SOE expenditures, for inspection by the Bank and for&#13;
audit.&#13;
(b)    The monthly summaries, prepared to support the sub-SOEs, would provide the&#13;
basic building block for the project accounts maintained by the DMU with&#13;
appropriate cross-referencing to allow the paper trail to be followed. Non-SOE&#13;
expenditures would be separately incorporated into the accounts, and copies of&#13;
the related documentation will be retained for inspection.&#13;
(c)    The project accounts would be summarized on an ongoing basis to show: (i)&#13;
actual versus planned expenditure for each quarter and year to date; (ii) how&#13;
Bank-financed and GOAP-financed expenditures are finalized by component&#13;
and category; (iii) actual versus planned expenditures to date: and (iv) appended&#13;
to the project account would be a listing of the Withdrawal Applications for the&#13;
period concerned, showing the amounts reimbursed. Unaudited project accounts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
with this attachment would be submitted by the DMU, as part of the quarterly&#13;
report.&#13;
(d)    Consolidated project accounts, including SOEs, accompanied by an auditor's&#13;
report, will be submitted annually to the World Bank, no later than six months&#13;
after the end of the fiscal year.&#13;
(e)    The auditor's report, accompanied by a Summary Statement of the Special&#13;
Account would be submitted to the World Bank no later than six months after&#13;
end of each fiscal year.&#13;
65.   Progress Reporting. The DMU will prepare a quarterly progress report indicating&#13;
physical and financial progress, in an agreed format, showing the physical and financial progress&#13;
of each project component, compared against the agreed plan with an explanation for the reasons&#13;
for deviation, and the remedial action proposed or taken. Progress made on achievement of the&#13;
agreed performance indicators should be incorporated in the report. The quarterly report will&#13;
incorporate the quarterly accounts referred to above. The quarterly report will be submitted to the&#13;
World Bank within four weeks after the end of each quarter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Section F: FINANCIAL -ANECONOMIC JI$TMCATION&#13;
MAJOR PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
66.   Discussion of economic justification is in Attachment 16.&#13;
67.   Project Benefits. The major benefit of the project would be putting in place long-termn&#13;
cyclone and flood hazard reduction measures that would reduce the loss of life, damage to&#13;
property and impact to productive capacity in future cyclones and floods. In particular, (i) timely&#13;
and adequate completion of repair and/or reconstruction of basic infrastructure to higher design&#13;
and construction standards would help restore economic activity on a more sustainable basis, and&#13;
diminish hardship of the affected population; (ii) prevention of salinity intrusions and storm&#13;
surges, along with improvement in watershed management, would lead to more stable&#13;
agricultural production and income in the highly vulnerable districts, which would also be&#13;
beneficial to AP as a whole considering that this sector is so central to its economic prosperity;&#13;
(iii) the involvement of local communities would also result in enhanced sustainability of the&#13;
restored infrastructure and cyclone and flood hazard mitigation structures, as they would take&#13;
greater care of these assets; and (iv) the enhancement of institutional capacity via the new&#13;
disaster management framework which would be in place at the end of project implementation&#13;
would further ensure that the economic and social impact of future disasters is minimized.&#13;
68.   The proposed project approaches natural hazard management and long-term mitigation&#13;
within the framework of environmental management. By emphasizing an integrated approach to&#13;
delta and coastal zone management connected to the flood and cyclone disaster management&#13;
planning, the proposed project would contribute to correct inadequate environmental practices&#13;
that are increasing the vulnerability of the coastal plain. In addition to saving lives and property,&#13;
the project would have a positive effect on the environment by supporting watershed and coastal&#13;
management, thereby helping to control natural resource depletion (especially naturally-&#13;
occurring mitigation elements such as mangroves), reduce vulnerability of irrigation and&#13;
transport infrastructure, and increase coastal defense.&#13;
69.   Project Risks. Two major risks have been identified: (a) GOI may fail to enhance the&#13;
early cyclone warning capacity. As a result, the desired benefit for the GOAP of saving lives&#13;
through early warning, timely evacuation and appropriate behavior would be impaired. To&#13;
safeguard against this risk, the Bank has secured assurances that IMD will enhance its early&#13;
cyclone warning capacity according to a schedule of agreed dates (See below Paragraph 41 .viii&#13;
and Section C of Technical Annex on IMD component). And (b) GOAP may falter on&#13;
committing adequate resources for the maintenance of restored assets. This risk has been&#13;
mitigated by a covenant requiring GOAP to fund not less than the maintenance levels&#13;
recommended in the Tenth Finance Commission and in consistency with agreements to be&#13;
reached for two other currently proposed Bank-financed projects for AP.6&#13;
6   AP Irrigation III and AP States Roads Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
.Setion G: PERFORMANCE MONITORNG INDICATORS&#13;
70.   Two kinds of indicators would be considered for monitoring progress of the proposed&#13;
project: (i) program performance indicators, which allow to measure progress made toward the&#13;
fulfillment of the stated short-, medium- and long-term mitigation and recovery objectives, as&#13;
described for each of the proposed project components; and (ii) project performance indicators,&#13;
which measure the flow of the project with respect to procurement procedures, contract&#13;
preparation and approval, and general disbursement issues. When necessary, initial values of&#13;
some performance indicators would be established to provide a baseline to evaluate the extent to&#13;
which target values for each objective are being met (see Attachment 14).&#13;
71.   The natural hazard mitigation objectives of the project require specific indicators to&#13;
measure progress toward cyclone and flood vulnerability reduction in the target areas. This&#13;
implies the need to measure advances in the Hazard Management Program including (i)&#13;
undertaking of the hazard studies and development of action plans; and (ii) social, environmental&#13;
and economic issues such as levels of community involvement, enhancement of institutional&#13;
capacity for disaster management, changes in peoples' disaster perception and in their attitudes&#13;
toward disaster mitigation, as well as community and government commitment to sustaining&#13;
mitigation works through the amounts channeled via the Vulnerability Reduction Fund. The&#13;
restoration objectives require to measure the extent to which essential assets of the road,&#13;
drainage and electricity networks that were affected by the recent disaster are being timely and&#13;
appropriately repaired and/or reconstructed. Simultaneously, an important component of the&#13;
long-term mitigation objectives is to facilitate the involvement of CBOs, NGOs and the public at&#13;
large in disaster management planning and to ensure that public campaigns are being undertaken&#13;
to raise people's awareness regarding cyclone and flood hazards. To gather the necessary&#13;
information to measure progress toward these ends a monitoring plan has been devised. The&#13;
latter includes: (i) changes in peoples' hazard awareness; (ii) levels of community involvement&#13;
and commitment; (iii) changes in peoples' perceptions; and (iv) degree of commitment to long-&#13;
term mitigation objectives on the part of government officials at the sub-district level.&#13;
72.   Proposed indicators to monitor project performance would be: (i) average duration of&#13;
procurement procedures from launching of bids to contract awards (in calendar days) by year;&#13;
(ii) average duration of preparation, signature and approval of contracts (in calendar days) by&#13;
year; (iii) percentage of contracts implemented within the scheduled time frame (by year); (iv)&#13;
percentage of contracts implemented with no cost overrun (by year); and (v) percentage of&#13;
payments processed or transmitted to IDA within 30 days after receipt of invoice or due date (by&#13;
year).&#13;

LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE RECENT DISASTER&#13;
1.    Several lessons have been learned as a consequence of the damages incurred during the&#13;
October and November 1996 floods and cyclone:&#13;
(a)    A large number of 220 KV and 132 KV towers could not withstand the high wind&#13;
velocities of 220-250 km/hour. The present system in the coastal region is designed to&#13;
withstand a maximum wind velocity of 150-180 kmh. Remedial measures to strengthen&#13;
selected 220 KV and 132 KV towers are necessary.&#13;
(b)    The prestressed concrete poles used for 33 KV and 11 KV lines have not responded&#13;
satisfactorily to high wind velocities. Nearly 17,000 poles collapsed during the November&#13;
cyclone in West Godavari district alone. Furthermore, the mild steel fabricated structures&#13;
could not withstand the cyclone. Conversely, the spun concrete cylindrical poles which&#13;
were used under the Bank's CERP project for constructing 713 km of 1 I KV lines and&#13;
643 km of 33 KV lines withstood the fury of the cyclone very well. Critical 33 KV and 11&#13;
KV lines should use round spun concrete poles.&#13;
(c)    For 11 KV and 33 KV lines using pre-stressed concrete poles, the Board's practice is to&#13;
pour concrete to the foundation of every fifth pole; the other four poles are just buried in&#13;
the ground. Such poles have been uprooted from the soil during floods as well as cyclones.&#13;
This practice needs to be changed.&#13;
(d)    The design of 11 KV and 33 KV lines with pin insulators has not proven satisfactory for&#13;
severe cyclonic conditions as conductors have become loose from the bindings.&#13;
Suspension insulators with clamps for conductors have proved to be superior.&#13;
(e)    Distribution transformers are placed by APSEB on concrete or steel platforms without&#13;
anchoring. Many of these have toppled during cyclones. Routine provision of anchor&#13;
bolts or strapping to hold transformers in place is essential.&#13;
(f)    Many 33 KV and 11 KV lines pass through fields, several kilometers away from the road.&#13;
Access to these lines became almost impossible after heavy rains due to flooding and&#13;
slushy land. It is necessary that routing of critical lines should be alongside roads.&#13;
(g)    The transmission line towers in the area are designed for a wind pressure of 150 kg/cm&#13;
(wind velocity of 180 km/hour). It is necessary to adopt a higher standard for the coastal&#13;
areas in view of the wind velocities in excess of 200 km/hour experienced in the latest&#13;
disaster.&#13;
(h)    APSEB depends primarily on powerline carrier (PLC) for communications in normal&#13;
times. During system collapse, as it happened after the November cyclone, the PLC&#13;
system becomes unavailable, thereby making communication difficult. VHF and UHF&#13;
communications facilities should be made available for the coastal systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
(i)    Restoration of supply to essential services such as public health centers, water works,&#13;
telephone exchanges, etc., took longer than necessary since no special higher reliability&#13;
feeders are provided for such facilities.&#13;
DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS&#13;
2.    In light of the experience of the floods and cyclone in October/November, 1996, APSEB&#13;
would review and revise the current design and construction standards. After the cyclone of 1990&#13;
and consequent to the CERP, some distribution facilities were constructed with more stringent&#13;
design standards (e.g., use of spun concrete poles for 1 1 KV and 33 KV lines). These facilities&#13;
were not damaged during the floods and cyclone of 1996. However, APSEB has continued to&#13;
apply lower standards to save initial capital cost.&#13;
3.    In order to provide a sound basis for the revision of design and construction standards,&#13;
APSEB should undertake a detailed study that reviews and recommends appropriate standards&#13;
taking into account the different vulnerability levels of the districts. Terms of reference for such a&#13;
study are provided in Attachment 15.&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.     After the floods and the cyclone, APSEB restored supply to most consumers in the affected&#13;
areas by carrying out repairs rapidly. Some of the repairs are of temporary nature, while most of&#13;
the restoration work was undertaken without assessing the need for upgrading the current design&#13;
and construction standards. The objective of the proposed project regarding the electricity network&#13;
is to assist APSEB in taking the necessary measures to complete the repair works while carrying&#13;
out the upgrading and strengthening of the network to diminish the impact of future disasters.&#13;
ACTIVITIES&#13;
5.     The activities included under this component are: (a) strengthening the existing 132 KV&#13;
and 220 KV transmission lines so that they can withstand cyclonic winds and floods; (b)&#13;
constructing some new 132 KV and 220 KV transmission lines and substations to improve the&#13;
reliability of supply, provide standby capacity and augment total supply capability; (c)&#13;
constructing new 33 KV lines with 12.5 meter spun concrete poles to provide alternate feed to&#13;
those 132 KV and 33 KV substations that do not have such facility; (d) construct new 1 1 KV lines&#13;
with 9.0 meter spun concrete poles so that each village has such a reliable feeder available to&#13;
supply essential loads such as pump houses, hospitals etc. and (e) provide additional&#13;
communication facilities to reduce reliance on PLCC facilities which become unavailable during&#13;
power failures. All new 33 KV and 11 KV lines will be routed along the road side for easier repair&#13;
access during emergencies.&#13;

HAZARD REDUCTION MEASURES&#13;
8.     The following mitigation measures for the distribution system are proposed:&#13;
(a)    33 KV lines emanating from a 132 KV or 220 KV substations feeding different 33 KV&#13;
substations in the cyclone-prone districts as alternate source of supply;&#13;
(b)    11 KV main lines emanating from a 33 KV or 132 KV sub-stations to cover all en-route&#13;
villages only. The proposed line is up to the entrance of the villages in the vulnerable districts;&#13;
(c)    Lines will be run along the road to facilitate easy erection, maintenance and rectification and&#13;
quick restoration of power supply in case of breakdowns or damages in the event of a cyclone;&#13;
(d)    In the coastal districts, the lines will be run on PSCC spun poles with a provision for multi-&#13;
circuits i.e., 3 to 4 lines, one 33 KV, one 1 1 KV and one or two LT lines; and&#13;
(e)    A reliable communication system that functions even during emergencies.&#13;
9.     The following mitigation options for the transmission system are proposed:&#13;
(a)    Tower strengthening;&#13;
(b)    Replacement of jointed conductor and earth wire;&#13;
(c)    Foundation and copings strengthening; and&#13;

IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
LI.    APSEB has adequate capability, organization and manpower to implement the proposed&#13;
activities. There would be no need for consultants for project design or construction management,&#13;
except for the study recommended in paragraph 3. During project implementation, there will be a&#13;
central cell in the APSE Board's main office in charge of monitoring the progress of works, coordinating&#13;
the supply of materials to the field, completing the accounts from the various districts, monitoring and&#13;
submitting reimbursement claims, and overseeing general project-related activities. The central cell will&#13;
also submit to the Bank detailed design reports - for review and comments for all components of&#13;
the project - and monthly progress reports.&#13;
O&amp;M ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
12.    APSEB has adequate and satisfactory O&amp;M arrangements in place for the type of&#13;
facilities that are being created under the project. The Board operates and maintains over 6,900&#13;
km of 220 KV lines, 9,900 km of 132 KV lines, 14,000 km of 33 KV lines and 380,000 km of 11&#13;
KV lines. It will not be necessary to increase O&amp;M budget provisions to any special extent on&#13;
account of the project.&#13;

AP HAZARD MITIGATION AND EMERGENCY CYCLONE RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE&#13;
PROJECT SCOPE&#13;
1     The GOAP and the Bank have identified the following two critical areas for emergency&#13;
recovery in the irrigation and drainage sector in the areas affected by the cyclone and floods of&#13;
1996, for funding under the project:&#13;
(a)    Drainage network: reconstruction and rehabilitation of drainage network.&#13;
(b)    Flood Embankments: reconstruction and rehabilitation of damaged flood banks.&#13;
2.    The project would not provide funding for restoration of a very large number of small&#13;
tanks. The GOAP has already secured funding of about US$34 million (Rs. 1180 million) from&#13;
NABARD for restoration of four large dams and construction of 101 new minor tanks/sources. In&#13;
addition GOAP has sought funding from NABARD for restoration of large number of minor&#13;
irrigation sources in eleven districts of the state damaged during the 1996 floods.&#13;
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
3.    The project will provide support for the following sub-components under the Irrigation and&#13;
Drainage component. Construction of new drains or new flood banks will be undertaken only if no&#13;
displacement of people is involved. If the studies reveal the need to acquire land or displace people,&#13;
construction of such new flood banks or drains will be deleted from the project:&#13;
(a)   Improvement to Drainage Network in the delta: US$34.1 million (Rs779.3 million); and&#13;
(b)   Improvement to Flood Embankments and construction of flood banks to protect one town&#13;
and four villages: US$11.8 million (Rs413.4 million)&#13;
TOTAL of Irrigation and Drainage Component: US$45.9 million (Rs 1192.7 million)&#13;
4.    Drainage Network (US$34.1 million, Rs779.3million). The major objective of&#13;
improvement to the drainage system is to complete the minor drains in the six delta districts, where&#13;
the improvement of a large number of major and medium drains was executed under the CERP, so&#13;
that the drainage of the entire valley/sub-valley is completed under the present project.&#13;
Improvement to 8 major drains and 23 medium drains in these districts, which have been identified&#13;
as essential to achieve the aforesaid objective is also included in the project. Two of the 8 major&#13;
drains proposed for improvement under the project are the leftover work of the CERP 1990&#13;
project. The project will also include replacement of 14 masonry structures across main drains&#13;
including three outfall structures at the junction of main drains with the Godavari river, as these&#13;
old structures are dilapidated and their replacement is essential for effective functioning of the&#13;
drainage system in the delta. The following table gives the district wise picture of the extent of&#13;
work involved under this component.&#13;

DESIGN STANDARDS, STATUS OF DESIGNS AND PLANNING&#13;
6.     Drainage Network The improvement to the drainage network will follow the Indian&#13;
Standard Guidelines (IS Code No: 8835 - 1978) and the criteria agreed and adopted for drainage&#13;
schemes improved under CERP 1990, which was based on a maximum three day rainfall with a&#13;
return period of 25 years. The alignments of all drains proposed to be improved under the project&#13;
are to follow the existing drain locations on ground. However detailed hydraulic designs based on&#13;
the agreed criteria have yet to be done, and therefore the present estimated cost is on prorata cost&#13;
per km of minor drains, based on costs for similar work executed in 1996. The estimated cost of&#13;
AP Hazard Mitigation and Emergency Cyclone Recovery Project&#13;
Attachment 6: Irrigation and Drainage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
medium and major drains is based on cumec/km rate based on actual work executed in the recent&#13;
past. It has been agreed that the implementation of this work will be subject to Bank's clearance&#13;
after the technical studies to establish its effectiveness and suitability in the context of the action&#13;
plans for hazard reduction planning, which is a main objective of this project are completed.&#13;
7.    Flood Embankments. Detailed studies will be carried out for the new flood banks&#13;
required to protect villages at risk. However, if any of the works involve displacement of people or&#13;
acquisition of land, these works will be deleted from the project. The repair and rehabilitation of&#13;
the existing flood banks in PIP, Gautmi Right and Left banks will follow the Indian Standard&#13;
Guidelines for planning and design of River Embankments (IS Code No. 12094-1987) and the&#13;
design criteria for flood protection embankment sections as prescribed by the Central Water&#13;
Commission (CWC) of the GOI. For improvement of existing tidal banks in West Godavari, the&#13;
standards agreed and adopted for Krishna Eastern Tidal Banks in Krishna district in the CERP&#13;
1990 will be followed. The estimation of present cost (1996 prices) is based on the actual length of&#13;
the embankments and finalized principal levels of the embankment based on the afore-mentioned&#13;
standards. However the exact cross-section of the embankments has to be designed based on test&#13;
results of soil to be used, and detailed cross-sections of the existing embankments. Final estimates&#13;
are expected to be ready by May 31,1997, for timely procurement and commencement of work by&#13;
December 1997.&#13;
8.    For flood protection works to Bhadrachalam town (Khammam district) which is a new&#13;
work, detailed field surveys have been carried out and detailed designs have been approved by the&#13;
Central Design Organization and are based on the above-mentioned IS code and CWC Guidelines.&#13;
The present cost, at 1996 prices, is based on detailed estimates. However, further studies to assess&#13;
and quantify the effect of the proposed embankment on the opposite bank of Godavari River are&#13;
necessary. The final design and alignment of the flood embankment to protect Ettapaka and&#13;
Marakala villages (Khammam district) and Etumagaram and Ramannagudem villages (Warangal&#13;
District) are yet be worked out, so the current cost estimates are approximate. The conditions for&#13;
implementation of these works will be similar to those indicated above for Bhadrachalam. If the&#13;
construction of any of the above embankinents involves displacement of people, the works will be&#13;
deleted from the project.&#13;
SPECIFICATIONS AND QUALITY CONTROL&#13;
9.    Construction works under the Irrigation and Drainage Component will be carried out by&#13;
the Irrigation Department, GOAP, through its field formations. AP Standard Specifications&#13;
currently applicable to these works and the construction practices recommended in the USBR&#13;
Earth Manual, Concrete Manual and Drainage Manual will be followed for execution of works&#13;
under the project. Suitable Check Lists and O.K. Card system for construction control will be&#13;
developed by the Chief Engineer Major Irrigation who is in charge of both the sub-components of&#13;
the Irrigation and Drainage Component of the Project and controls six field circles headed by&#13;
Superintending Engineers for these works.&#13;
10.   In view of the fact that a large amount of work, in both physical and financial terms, has&#13;
to be executed under this emergency project, it is essential that due attention is paid to ensure high&#13;
quality of works in the field. An independent Quality Control Unit headed by a Superintending&#13;
Engineer exists in the Irrigation Department, which reports to the Chief Engineer Central Designs&#13;
Organization. He has four Executive Engineers and supporting technical staff to assist him. This&#13;
Unit has designated technical staff for works in each field circle. This independent Quality Control&#13;
AP Hazard Mitigation and Emergency Cyclone Recovery Project&#13;
Attachment 6: Irrigation and Drainage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
Unit will furnish reports on quality of works simultaneously to the Engineer-in-Chief, the Chief&#13;
Engineer Designs and the Chief Engineer Major Irrigation.&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR HAZARD REDUCTION&#13;
11.   Dam Safety Assurance Program. In order to ensure that the dams are continuously&#13;
maintained in good health to withstand the forces of nature, an institutional mechanism to&#13;
implement a Dam Safety Assurance Program (DSAP) in the state is essential.&#13;
I1.    The various steps to implement a Dam Safety Assurance Program are:&#13;
(a)    Setting up a State Dam Safety Organization (DSO) in the State Irrigation Department,&#13;
headed by an officer of level not less than a Superintending Engineer, to be designated as&#13;
Director DSO. The DSO will be provided with adequate number of Executive Engineers&#13;
and Assistant Engineers and other technical staff. The Director DSO will be responsible&#13;
for monitoring the implementation of the DSAP in respect of all dams in the state&#13;
(covering dams maintained by various departments of the state as well as private parties, if&#13;
any). He will report to the Chief Engineer Designs and Engineer-in- Chief Irrigation. The&#13;
Director DSO will also be the Member Secretary of the State Dam Safety Committee (see&#13;
below).&#13;
(b)    A State Dam Safety Committee (SDSC) will be set up under the chairmanship of the&#13;
Secretary Irrigation Department and all Chief Engineers will be members of this&#13;
committee. The Director DSO will be the Secretary of the SDSC. The SDSC will meet at&#13;
least once in three months to review the implementation of the DSAP, described below.&#13;
(c)    The various actions required to achieve a satisfactory Dam Safety Assurance Program are:&#13;
(i) Bi-annual (pre-monsoon and post monsoon) inspections of all dams by the field officials&#13;
in charge of the dam maintenance at the level of designated authority depending on the&#13;
size/hazard potential of the dam or dams. These inspections should be carried out and&#13;
inspection reports on prescribed formats sent by the inspecting officer to the Director DSO&#13;
and the Chief Engineer concerned.&#13;
(ii) Evaluation of the bi-annual report by the DSO to assess the safety condition of the dam&#13;
and reporting to concerned Chief Engineer of action. Annual repairs or special repairs,&#13;
where found necessary on the basis of this evaluation will be the responsibility of the&#13;
concerned Chief Engineer.&#13;
(iii) DSO to carry out, independently, Phase I inspections of all large dams (as per&#13;
definition by International Commission of Large Dams) in accordance with "Guidelines&#13;
for Safety Inspection of Dams" issued by the Central Water Commission in the year&#13;
1987. All dams having a maximum height of more than 15 meters and /or having a gross&#13;
storage capacity of more than 60 million cum will fall in this category. All large dams in&#13;
the state will go through a Phase I inspection once in a five year cycle. The Director DSO&#13;
will prepare evaluation report of Phase I inspections and present the same in the SDSC,&#13;
pointing out the names of dams requiring detailed Phase II investigations (as per CWC&#13;
Guidelines of 1987). SDSC will fix priorities and time schedule for such Phase II&#13;
investigations to be carried out through the Chief Engineer Designs and Chief Engineer in&#13;
charge, or through consultants.&#13;
(iv) Based on the result of Phase II investigations, which will cover both the structural as&#13;
well as hydrologic analyses, designs for remedial works to dams will be carried out and&#13;
thereafter implemented to bring the dam to a safe condition according to the currently&#13;
AP Hazard Mitigation and Emergency Cyclone Recovery Project&#13;
Attachment 6: Irrigation and Drainage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
standards of India. The SDSC will decide on the prioritization for carrying out remedial works and&#13;
provide special funds for the purpose.&#13;

ROADS AND 1I:IDGES&#13;
1.    This attachment provides details of the project proposals by District for both the State&#13;
Roads and Buildings (R&amp;B) Department and the Panchayati Raj Engineering Department.&#13;
Depending on bid prices received during implementation, the restoration costs of roads and bridges&#13;
proposed could exceed the funds allowed under this component. In such an eventuality, the&#13;
selection of roads and bridges for restoration will follow the prioritization arrived at under the joint&#13;
consultations between the Departments and the District authorities.&#13;
2.    All road works will be carried out to enhanced standards given in Attachment 12.&#13;
3.    Any road works that require land acquisition or requires the displacement of people, will&#13;
be deleted from the project. If it is necessary to displace people for road widening, the relevant&#13;
section of the road will be excluded from the project or the widening will not be undertaken.&#13;
OBECTIVE AND STRATEGY&#13;
4.    The main objective of the proposed investments is to create a reliable road network that&#13;
connects vulnerable areas to select nodal centers from where transport, relief and rehabilitation&#13;
operations can be coordinated in the event of a natural disaster. To this effect, some important&#13;
arterial roads, which serve large populations, are proposed to be improved to standards that can&#13;
withstand cyclonic rains and floods. The thrust of the project is on the creation of a dependable&#13;
road connections between vulnerable areas and the National Highways which can then act as links&#13;
to important centers from where relief operations, like food and medical supplies, can be effectively&#13;
channeled. The development of these roads will also help the vulnerable population salvage&#13;
whatever agricultural produce they can and convey them to the market centers. Both State&#13;
Highways and Major District Roads have been considered as per the need of the area, as&#13;
articulated by the District representatives.&#13;
PRIORITIZATION OF PROPOSALS&#13;
5.    Prioritization has been based on vulnerability and hazard mitigation. Wherever the general&#13;
road condition is found to be bad due to its poor sub-grade or the roads are considered crucial for&#13;
cyclone mitigation, they have been accorded a higher priority. Wherever link or alternate routes&#13;
are required for the NH, they have been considered along with linkage to other important corridors&#13;
of State Highways. The ERR for most of the roads included in the project vary between 12 percent&#13;
and 20 percent.&#13;
6.    Improvement to the selected set of road stretches has been accorded the highest priority in&#13;
a process of consultation at the District and State levels. Critical damaged road sections were&#13;
identified in various districts and prioritized on the basis of the population they served and their&#13;
criticality within the network. The pre- and post-disaster status of such roads were assessed and&#13;
the major bottlenecks identified in each of the affected districts. Detailed cost estimates for repair&#13;
and restoration using both existing and improved specifications were calculated. The implication&#13;
of using better specifications on O&amp;M expenses was also estimated. Based on these, the priority I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
and 2 options were arrived. Some important Panchayati Raj roads connecting (a) vulnerable&#13;
settlements to link roads (b) settlements to cyclone shelters are also being proposed.&#13;
7.    The proposed improvements, in the form of strengthening the existing crust and widening&#13;
of the carriageway of the roads, are listed below:&#13;
Widening of Carriageway:   3.80M to 5.50M (1/L) or 7.00 M (DIL) with gravel shoulders&#13;
Strengthening:             Building additional crust with:&#13;
1) Profile correction course with Bituminous Macadam layer&#13;
50mm thick&#13;
2) Bituminous Macadam/Dense Bituminous Macadam layer of&#13;
50mm thick&#13;
3) Bituminous concrete wearing course 25mm thick&#13;
Bridges:                   Reconstruction of collapsed structures and construction of high&#13;
level bridges at existing bed level/low level causeways which&#13;
cause obstruction during floods.&#13;
8.    Embankments will be raised to a minimum of 0.60 to 1.0 above average ground level and&#13;
formation is proposed to be widened to 9M to 12M as per standards of IRD. The embankment is&#13;
proposed to be protected at vulnerable areas such as canal/drain banks with revetment/retaining&#13;
walls using geo-textile. Drains are also proposed within village limits in combination with concrete&#13;
pavements in low lying areas.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
9.    The R&amp;B and PR departments will implement the project. They have the capabilities and&#13;
experience required to execute the task. Under the CERP with World Bank assistance, these&#13;
departments successfully completed 90 projects and two other projects, executed with assistance&#13;
from the Asian Development Bank, are nearing completion under R&amp;B as per schedule. These&#13;
departments also have separate cells to execute extemally aided projects. This functions under the&#13;
direct supervision of the Engineers-in-Chief of the respective departments.&#13;
DETAILED PROPOSALS&#13;
10.   The list of roads arrived at following the above prioritization is attached. Table 1 provide&#13;
the list of state roads under the R&amp;B Department. Tables 2a and 2b lists the rural roads under the&#13;
responsibility of the Panchayati Raj Engineering Department. Any land acquisition or road&#13;
widening that involves displacement of people will be excluded from the project. If any stretches&#13;
of roads scheduled for widening involve displacement of people, the relevant stretch will be&#13;
dropped from the project or the widening will not be undertaken.&#13;

AP HAZARD MITIGATION AND EMERGENCY CYCLONE RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
MITIGATION WORKS&#13;
Sub-Component 1: Tree Shelter Belts&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.    The main objectives of this sub-component are to: (i) increase protection of life and&#13;
property from the cyclonic storms, gales and tidal waves; (ii) increase protection from deposition of&#13;
sand and salt brought in by the high wind speeds; (iii) stabilize sand dunes from shifting and of&#13;
water course embankments; (iv) prevent floods and consolidate river banks and canal bunds; (v)&#13;
increase the area under tree cover, thereby creating better environmental conditions along coastal&#13;
zones; (vi) make fuel, fodder and construction materials available to the people; and (vii) improve&#13;
the social and economic conditions of coastal residents.&#13;
PLAN OF ACTIVITIES&#13;
2.    The following strategies are proposed: (i) raising shelter belt plantations in R.F. and&#13;
government lands; (ii) replanting of Casuarina fields damaged during the November 1996 cyclone;&#13;
(iii) raising mangrove plantations; (iv) raising seedlings for distribution to the local communities;&#13;
(v) production of genetically superior clonal seedlings of Casuarina; and (vi) public information&#13;
and extension (See Table I below for district-wise targets of each strategy). To ensure the&#13;
sustainability of this mitigation measure, local communities will be involved and awareness will be&#13;
created with respect of the need to manage and protect these plantations. The notion of 'Joint&#13;
Forest Management' with the local people will be adopted in the raising and maintenance of shelter&#13;
belt plantations.&#13;

SCOPE&#13;
3.     Since the maximum mitigative benefits can only be achieved if the shelter belts are&#13;
extended all along the coast, implementation of this component is proposed for the 74 coastal&#13;
mandals of Srikakulam, Vizayanagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West Godavari,&#13;
Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam and Nellore.&#13;

has been raising plantations of Casuarina equisitifolia since 1977. These plantations are on&#13;
revenue lands handed over to the department and on reserved forest lands. There are wide gaps in&#13;
the shelter belt plantations, due to segments of government and privately-owned lands without any&#13;
tree cover. The government lands can easily be planted to diminish the gaps.&#13;
5.     Some of the existing plantations have matured and are becoming old. To be effective as&#13;
shelter belts, the trees need to be kept fit and healthy through periodic culling and replanting, which&#13;
helps the shelter belt and increases State revenues. Mature trees also need to be harvested to avoid&#13;
pilfering. It is proposed to harvest mature plantations in a phased manner and replant the felled&#13;
areas with Casuarina. The felling of these plantations will be planned in a way that whenever the&#13;
harvest is taken up, a mature crop (over four-years old) will be left standing to perform the&#13;
function of a shelter belt. Planting will be done at two meters by two meters intervals in all the&#13;
forest and government lands.&#13;
6.     Replanting of shelter belt plantations damaged during the November 1996 Cyclone.&#13;
During the recent cyclone, Casuarina plantations covering about 800 ha and distributed in four&#13;
series of Kandikuppa area planted from 1984 to 1995 in East Godavari were completely damaged.&#13;
These plantations absorbed the shock of the cyclonic storm and protected the population and&#13;
infrastructure in their immediate hinterland, while experiencing damage that resulted in a high&#13;
number of broken crowns and branches, and uprooted trees. Harvesting of these plantations is&#13;
taking place under the responsibility of the Forest Department. These plantations need to be&#13;
replanted immediately to raise the shelter belt again. Replanting will be done with Casuarina, by&#13;
working on 400 ha during 1997 and the other 400 ha during the 1998 planting season. For this&#13;
activity, traditional planting techniques used by the Forest Department for this species will be&#13;
followed.&#13;
7.     Raising of mangrove plantations. Mangrove forests form an important, delicate and&#13;
dynamic ecosystem in the shore area, principally in the inter-tidal zones laying along sheltered&#13;
shores, estuaries, tidal creeks, back waters, fringing reefs, salt marshes and coastal mud flats.&#13;
Mangroves are also effective shelter belts against the effects of cyclones. They contain, however, a&#13;
highly specialized and sensitive community of plant species and associated fauna which cannot&#13;
survive under different conditions. Mangroves suffer from heavy biotic pressure due to gazing and&#13;
pilferage of fuel wood and small timber. Consequently, they have been disappearing rapidly. It is&#13;
intended to plant all the available and suitable areas along the coast with mangrove plantations.&#13;
8.     Beneficiary oriented nursery programs. To guarantee the sustainability of the activity,&#13;
people need to be encouraged to grow trees in their own lands. It is proposed to raise and&#13;
distribute free of charge a large number of fodder, fuel and small seedlings to the people, so that&#13;
they can increase the tree cover of their farmland and around their houses. High value fruit&#13;
seedlings such as cashew and coconut (up to 15 plants) will be made available to the farmers living&#13;
AP Hazard Mitigation and Emergency Cyclone Recovery Project&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
within the 500 meters zone, which will also help improve their economic situation. In general,&#13;
planting of coconut will be encouraged around the field bunds and selected community centers.&#13;
9.      To take up afforestation on a large scale, a significant number of seedlings will have to be&#13;
raised. It is proposed to raise nurseries of fodder, small timber, cashew and coconut seedlings with&#13;
help from the beneficiaries. The beneficiary-oriented nursery program will be developed similarly&#13;
to the rural employment programs. Each beneficiary will have to raise 25,000 bag plants and&#13;
100,000 naked seedlings. The beneficiary will be provided by the Forest Department with bags,&#13;
soil mixture and planting material or seed. For their effort, beneficiaries will be paid Rs 1,000&#13;
p.m. during the seven-month nursery period (February to August). At the end of the work,&#13;
beneficiaries will be paid the difference between the estimated cost - according to estimates&#13;
prepared for the individual requirements stated above - and the money already paid, plus a bonus&#13;
of three paise for every bag plant and 0.5 paise for every naked seedling produced. The goal is to&#13;
raise 100,000 bag plants and 500,000 naked seedlings annually through the beneficiaries in each&#13;
coastal mandal. Fifty thousand coconut seedlings per district will also be raised annually through&#13;
beneficiaries for distribution to the public in coastal mandals.&#13;
10.    Production of genetically superior clonal seedlings. The Forest Department has&#13;
identified genetically superior clones of Casuarina equisitifolia with higher yield of fuel wood,&#13;
timber and crown formation. It is proposed to raise these clonal seedlings in large numbers and&#13;
supply the farmers for planting in their lands. Given the technical nature of this activity, it will be&#13;
fully undertaken by the department. The goal is to raise 400,000 seedlings annually.&#13;
11.    Information dissemination and extension. It is of utmost relevance to develop tree&#13;
plantation as a viable and attractive economic alternative. Efforts will be made to educate people&#13;
through information dissemination campaigns, audio-visual aids, seminars, workshops, field visits&#13;
and training programs. The supervisory staff will be trained to meet the demands of this&#13;
challenging scheme. Circulation of literature and information, visit to successful sites and&#13;
exchange of experiences among members of different communities will be the cornerstone of the&#13;
program. Extension through schools, adult education centers and voluntary organizations will also&#13;
be taken up. Special efforts will be made to ensure women's participation, using the existing&#13;
women's thrift and credit institutions as entry points.&#13;
PROJECT COSTS&#13;
12.    Project costs are estimated at Rs100 million. The plantations raised under this scheme will&#13;
have to be maintained until the year 2001/2002. See Table 2 below for more detailed information.&#13;

Sub-Component 2: Cyclone Shelters&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
13.   The main objectives proposed are: (i) make an adequate provision through community&#13;
shelters and associated spaces/structure to save human lives and livestock, ensure their sustenance&#13;
during a disaster, and safeguard basic assets need by people to survive after the disaster; and (ii)&#13;
bring deteriorated or damaged shelters to adequate levels of structural safety and functional use by&#13;
repairing them to enhanced standards whenever necessary.&#13;
STRATEGY&#13;
14.    The strategies proposed are:&#13;
a) to conduct an appraisal of the viability of cyclone shelters as an emergency response measure&#13;
as opposed to evacuation or strengthening of existing public and/or private buildings.&#13;
b) to identify critical settlements based on district wise hazard mapping and focus on the repair,&#13;
upgrade or new construction of shelters in high risk zones.&#13;
c) to construct all new shelters as school buildings to ensure its adequate upkeep.&#13;
d) to redesign shelters in storm surge risk zones and appraise the effectiveness of existing shelters&#13;
in the event of a storm surge.&#13;
e) to appraise the status of other existing public buildings in vulnerable settlements which may be&#13;
strengthened to serve as emergency shelters.&#13;
f) to appraise the adequacy of shelter location with respect to the settlement pattern and&#13;
community characteristics of high risk habitations.&#13;
PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS&#13;
15.   In low surge areas, where the tides vary from one to two meters, the shelters will be&#13;
located on higher lands and will have a raised plinth. Options for high surge areas are being&#13;
investigated. In these areas the shelter shall have an RCC framed structure, using concrete of&#13;
strength not less than M20 with increased cover thickness. The building will be designed for a&#13;
heavy cyclonic wind velocity of 250 kmh, in addition to the dead and live loads recommended by&#13;
the National Building Code (NBC). Experiences from other countries prone to storm surges will&#13;
be analyzed as part of the process to identify the appropriate structural design for emergency&#13;
shelters in areas of AP facing similar vulnerable conditions.&#13;
MAINTENANCE&#13;
16.    The District collectors will be responsible for putting shelters to use as schools or other&#13;
community purposes during normal times. Under the Janmabhoomi program, local communities&#13;
have assumed the responsibility of maintaining public buildings such as schools, primary health&#13;
centers, dispensaries, etc. Shelters that are also schools will be covered by this program, thereby&#13;
ensuring that they will be properly maintained.&#13;

PROPOSALS&#13;
17.    Construction of cyclone shelters would be taken up across the nine coastal districts, giving&#13;
priority to villages close to the shore with few permanent buildings. Three types of shelter design&#13;
have been used in AP: circular, "L" shape and rectangular. The "L" shape design was found to&#13;
be the most suitable, and was used during the CERP. New cyclone shelters are proposed to be&#13;
constructed in Prakasam, Nellore, Khamman, and East and West Godavari, at an estimated cost of&#13;
Rs900,000 (see Table 1 below for total cost of the cyclone shelter component). Construction&#13;
activity will be undertaken by the Panchayati Raj Department, while future maintenance will be the&#13;
responsibility of the respective district.&#13;

Sub-Component 3: Watershed Management&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
18.    The concept of combating drought was initiated by the GOI in 1971. The main objective&#13;
of the program was restoration of ecological balance through an integrated development on a&#13;
watershed basis. Initially, it was a sectoral program and it had its own shortcomings. However,&#13;
the Watershed Development Program has undergone many refinements over this period.&#13;
19.    The Drought Prone Area Program was introduced in Andhra Pradesh in 1975, in 69&#13;
erstwhile blocks, in 8 districts. The program was extended to I 1I1 blocks covering 12 districts in&#13;
1995. A major change in the approach of the Watershed Management Program was introduced in&#13;
1995-96 by focusing the Watershed Program on population participation. Under this approach,&#13;
total emphasis surrounds organizing the village community of each watershed into a viable&#13;
sustained unit. The watershed beneficiaries both directly and indirectly dependent on the watershed&#13;
will be grouped into the Watershed Associations with one of the members as the President of the&#13;
Association.&#13;
20.   In addition to the Watershed Association, an executive body called a Watershed&#13;
Committee will be formed to implement the day-to-day activities of the Watershed Development&#13;
Program. The members of the Watershed Committee will be nominated by the Watershed&#13;
Association. Each Watershed Committee will consist of 11 to 12 members from different sections&#13;
of beneficiaries, including women.&#13;

Attachment 8: Mitigation Works&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
21.    An intermediate body called a Project Implementing Agency (PIA) will be in charge of&#13;
about 10 Watersheds of 500 ha. each. These PlAs will preferably be selected from Non-&#13;
Governmental Organizations/Voluntary Organizations with sufficient experience in rural&#13;
development programs. These PIAs will help guide the Watershed Committees and Watershed&#13;
Associations. Each PIA will necessarily have a teamn of experts in Agriculture, Forestry, Minor&#13;
Irrigation and Social Services.&#13;
22.    At district level, the District Rural Development Agency is the model agency for the&#13;
implementation of the programs. It will be assisted by a multi-disciplinary team, consisting of&#13;
subject matter specialists in Agriculture, Forestry and Minor Irrigation Sectors to co-ordinate and&#13;
oversee the successful implementation of the program at district level.&#13;
FUNDING&#13;
23.    The funds related to the works component will be provided directly to the Watershed&#13;
Committees. Funds for administrative expenses will be retained at the DRDA/PIA level.&#13;
TRAINING&#13;
24.    One of the most important aspects of the program will be imparting training to all field&#13;
functionaries at the district level, the PIA level and all beneficiaries of watershed villages directly&#13;
or indirectly concemed with the program. Participatory rural appraisal will be adopted for the&#13;
implementation of the program.&#13;
25.    The project is proposed to be extended to one district in the Coastal Andhra Region, i.e.&#13;
Nellore, and two districts in Telangana, i.e. Karimnagar and Adilabad. Anantapur is classified as&#13;
a desert district by the Government of India and Desert Development Program in operation.&#13;
Serious water shortages are experienced in both districts for agriculture and drinking. Nellore, one&#13;
of the districts in coastal Andhra Pradesh, has maximum area under Wasteland category. The&#13;
Northern part of the district falls adjacent to the Rayalaseema districts and shares similar&#13;
geography, soil and climatic factors. There are serious limitations regarding the availability of&#13;
ground water.&#13;
26.    Chittoor, Karimnagar and Adilabad are covered with degraded forests in a major portion&#13;
of the region. Deforestation over a period of 3 decades has resulted in loss on catchment areas for&#13;
the Godavari basin in Karimnagar and Adilabad districts, hence water shortages are very common.&#13;
PROJECT PERIOD&#13;
27.    The estimated project period is three years, and is proposed to commence in July 1997.&#13;
Each watershed covers approximately 500 ha., which may be coterminous either to a village or one&#13;
or two villages. We anticipate the active participation of not only the state holders but also the&#13;
village community as mentioned above.&#13;
PROJECT COST&#13;
28.    Proposed cost for each watershed is Rs2O.00 lakhs. Per hectare cost is Rs4000/-. In the&#13;
first year it is proposed to spend Rs6.00 lakhs and in the second and third years Rs7.00 lakhs each.&#13;

METHODOLOGY&#13;
29.   Watersheds will be selected by taking into consideration the water shortage based on&#13;
National Remote Sensing Agency/AP State Remote Sensing Agency studies coupled with&#13;
orientation and enthusiasm of the local people to take up watershed works. Planning, Project&#13;
Formulation, cost implementation, monitoring, and social audit will be taken up by actively&#13;
involving the local people.&#13;

D.AFT GAP PICY STATEMENT ON LONG-TERM HAZARDMITIGAION;&#13;
1.    The draft policy statement prepared by the GOAP on its long-term hazard reduction&#13;
strategy was reviewed during negotiations. Based on these discussions, the Bank and the GOAP&#13;
agreed on the principles that would be incorporated in the policy statement. It was agreed that the&#13;
revised policy statement will be published in the official Gazette during April 1997.&#13;
2.     The GOAP policy statement will incorporate the following:&#13;
(i) Objectives. Objectives of the proposed policy would be to: develop action plans, and a&#13;
planning and implementation framework for hazard reduction, and to reduce people's dependency&#13;
on govermment, and to encourage self sufficiency and responsible use of resources.&#13;
(ii) Needfor a new approach. In addition to the debilitating effects of continuous&#13;
disasters there are a number of factors that have prompted GOAP to rethink is policy. Among them&#13;
are: the inability of government to bear the continuing heavy cost of relief and rehabilitation; the&#13;
expectation of the public that government should assist them every time; legal and illegal economic&#13;
activities that exacerbate the impact from such events ( the denudation of forest cover; the impact&#13;
of aquaculture activities); inadequate coastal, delta, water and watershed management policies and&#13;
practices; inappropriate design criteria and construction practices for public and private&#13;
infrastructure and building construction in the high risk zones, lack of proper planning and&#13;
development control that contribute to vulnerability from natural hazards; and the unavailability of&#13;
appropriate insurance schemes for individual risk management&#13;
(iii) Work plan. In order to develop a long-term hazard reduction program, and achieve&#13;
the expected goals of such a program, it is necessary to do the following:&#13;
(a) Creation of a Disaster Mitigation Council, headed by the Chief Minister, to develop&#13;
policy and to oversee the development of long-term hazard reduction programs;&#13;
(b) Formation of a permanent Disaster Management Unit to manage the preparation of a&#13;
long-tern hazard reduction program, action plans and policy, planning and implementation&#13;
framework, and its policy implementation;&#13;
(c) Creation of District Disaster Management Committees;&#13;
(d) Creation of a Vulnerability Reduction Fund for helping communities to undertake&#13;
hazard reduction activities on a matching grant basis;&#13;
(e) Undertaking of hazard reduction studies: coastal and delta management studies;&#13;
watershed management studies; enhancing of GOI's early warning capability through&#13;
deployment of state of the art equipment; early waming and community awareness raising&#13;
programs; preparation of hazard maps for high risk zones; and developing design criteria&#13;
for high risk zones.&#13;
(f) Undertaking hazard mitigation works, such as watershed management in critically&#13;
water-starved areas, planting of tree shelter belts, and provision of emergency cyclone&#13;
shelters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
(iv) Outputs. Expected outcomes of the work plan are:&#13;
(a) a revised policy for long-term hazard reduction;&#13;
(b) planning and development control of economic activities, siting and construction of&#13;
new infrastructure in hazard-prone zones for reduction of future hazards;&#13;
(c) a design and building code for high risk areas;&#13;
(d) planning and development control framework for coastal, delta water and watershed&#13;
management;&#13;
(e) measures and incentives for communities to take responsibility for hazard management&#13;
in their communities; and&#13;
(f) insurance schemes for individuals to protect themselves against natural hazards.&#13;
(v) Completion. Schedule for preparation of hazard reduction program require the work&#13;
on the studies to commence at the end of 1997, with the expected date of completion in December&#13;
1999.&#13;
(vi) Public Participation. Methodology for informiing the public and solicitation of views&#13;
on emerging proposals must be developed. Periodic seminars and workshops; statutory mandated&#13;
public hearings of planning and development control proposals that represent the core framework&#13;
for participants.&#13;
(vii)  Implementing Agency. The preparatory studies and the development of action&#13;
plans and the framework for hazard management will be carried out by the Disaster Management&#13;
Unit in the Department of Finance and Planning, headed by the Secretary of Finance, GOAP.&#13;

THE AND)HRA PRADESII DISASTER MANAGEMENT UNIT&#13;
1.    The AP Disaster Management Unit (DMU), envisaged as a permanent nodal unit, will be&#13;
created in the Department of Finance and Planning, under the Secretary of Finance (see Figure 1:&#13;
Organizational Chart on page 5 of this attachment). The Unit will be headed by a full-time Project&#13;
Director who will be responsible for day-to-day operations. It will be responsible for overall&#13;
management and coordination of the project, inter-departmental coordination, environmental&#13;
screening and clearance of sub-projects, management of hazard reduction related consultant studies&#13;
and for planning and development of long-term hazard reduction action plans for the State. It will&#13;
also act as the secretariat for the Disaster Mitigation Council headed by the Chief Minister.&#13;
Initially, the Unit will have a skeletal staff and will retain specialists for specific tasks. It will be&#13;
staffed throughout the implementation period and its capacity built up to enable full management&#13;
of the hazard reduction programn, by the end of the project. The small core staff will include a&#13;
disaster management expert, a communications/public information expert, a transport engineer, an&#13;
environmental engineer and an irrigation engineer. Other experts will be contracted from&#13;
appropriate government departments and centers or from the private sector.&#13;
RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER UNITS, AGENCIES, INSTITUTES, AND DEPARTMENTS&#13;
2.    The DMU will use the services of the existing PMU in the Department of Finance and&#13;
Planning for procurement and disbursement functions and other agencies for specialized services.&#13;
It will collaborate with other centers, institutes and agencies - within the State and beyond -&#13;
engaging in similar or related activities. Following the principle established for the CERP, the&#13;
DMU will require each sector department to create disaster mitigation 'cells'. These cells will&#13;
provide technical consultation on and review of best loss reduction practices associated with&#13;
maintenance of existing infrastructure and qualification of new capital investment. The cells would&#13;
be specifically responsible for disaster loss reduction activities and will be located in the main&#13;
implementing departments such as the Forest Department, Roads and Building Department, Major&#13;
and Minor Irrigation Department, Rural Development, Panchayati Raj and Engineering&#13;
Department, and the APSEB. Senior specialists serving in the DMU will provide liaison with the&#13;
key departments, provide training and tools, and provide oversight for disaster management&#13;
programs initiated in each department. The DMU will also serve to provide accurate, consistent&#13;
data on damage in future disasters and to evaluate the effectiveness of loss reduction measures.&#13;
3.     The DMU will also work closely with other public agencies at the state, district, and local&#13;
levels to provide appropriate technical information, professional training, and public information&#13;
on disaster loss reduction. The existing relevant agencies of the Government of Andhra Pradesh&#13;
(GOAP) with which the Unit will have working relationships are:&#13;
(a) Andhra Pradesh Remote Sensing and Applications Center&#13;
(b) Commissioner for Relief&#13;
(c) Shore Area Development Authority&#13;
(d) Kolleru Development Authority&#13;
(e) Bureau of Economics and Statistics&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
(f) Center for Economic and Social Studies (CES)&#13;
(g) Andhra Pradesh Academy for Rural Development&#13;
4.     Relevant agencies of the Government of India (GOI) with which the DMU will have to&#13;
work are:&#13;
(h) National Center for Disaster Management of the Indian Institute of Public&#13;
Administration&#13;
(i) India Meteorological Department&#13;
(j) Central Water Commission&#13;
(k) Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune&#13;
(1) National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA)&#13;
(m) Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI)&#13;
SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS&#13;
5      The functions of the DMU will include: hazard mapping, development of action plans for&#13;
hazard reduction, development of standards for siting design construction and maintenance. The&#13;
DMU will develop programs for hazard loss reduction including inspection of facilities,&#13;
certification of compliance with hazard mitigation standards, provide environmental clearances,&#13;
and create the incentive schemes to encourage appropriate reduction measures. In addition, The&#13;
Unit will provide technical and administrative support to the Andhra Pradesh Disaster Mitigation&#13;
Council, which is the policy level Cabinet committee headed by the Chief Minister.&#13;
6.     Furthermore, the DMU will serve as a point of contact with disaster management units in&#13;
other states (such as the Maharashtra Disaster Management Center at Yashada in Pune) and other&#13;
intemational centers of disaster management such as the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center&#13;
(ADPC) and various centers in the United States disaster response system.&#13;
7.     At the conclusion of this project, the DMU will become the authoritative source for&#13;
information on all phases and all aspects of disaster mitigation planning and implementation in&#13;
Andhra Pradesh. It will initiate and coordinate hazard management and vulnerability reduction&#13;
programs throughout the state. The DMU will utilize the resources of modern science and&#13;
engineering for the development of tools which will be useful at the local level in guiding decisions&#13;
to reduce future disaster losses of life and property.&#13;
8.    Job descriptions need to be developed for the key staff of the DMU. Sample job&#13;
descriptions for the Disaster Management Expert and the Communications Expert are given below:&#13;
9.     Position Description for Key Staff of the DMU:&#13;
(a) Hazard Management Specialist&#13;
Responsibilities: The Hazard Management Specialist will be principally in charge of the&#13;
development and dissemination of hazard maps, contraction standards, and materials&#13;
relevant to the reduction of future losses due to cyclone, wind, coastal flooding, and flash&#13;
flooding. The specialist will work in close cooperation with the scientists who apply the&#13;
flood and storm surge models to prepare useful hazard maps at appropriate scale and with&#13;
appropriate impact intensity scales for the hazard prone areas of Andhra Pradesh.&#13;

The Hazard Management Specialist will specifically:&#13;
(i) work closely with the community of engineers, architects, builders, and public and&#13;
private developers who are responsible for the siting and design of human settlements and&#13;
facilities in the coastal zone and flood plains of Andhra Pradesh.&#13;
(ii) initiate and manage useful dialogue between the developers and the users of hazard&#13;
data and maps.&#13;
(iii) review specific design and construction standards on a regular basis to ensure that&#13;
they represent current scientific and engineering knowledge and to ensure that these are&#13;
socially acceptable and cost-effective. These reviews should be based on the advice of&#13;
nationally recognized specialists.&#13;
(iv) oversee the preparation of policy studies to inform government on key questions of&#13;
mitigation policy.&#13;
(v) work closely with the Communications and Community Participation Specialist to&#13;
prepare scientifically correct materials for broad public distribution on hazard awareness,&#13;
appropriate response to warnings, appropriate post-disaster actions, and most importantly&#13;
disaster mitigation measures which can be incorporated into normal day to day activities.&#13;
Qualifications: The Hazard Management Specialist requires a technical background in a&#13;
civil engineering, architecture, or planning field. The candidate should have at least a&#13;
Master's degree with some experience with research in the discipline. Ideally, the&#13;
candidates will have some experience of public service in an agency with land use planning&#13;
or construction responsibilities. The candidates should not have only a narrow technical&#13;
experience but must also be familiar with the social, economic, and political constraints&#13;
which influence public policy. Some training in social science or economics would be&#13;
desirable. Finally, the candidate will need excellent communication and interpersonal&#13;
skills as a significant component of this job will involve bringing together diverse&#13;
communities of expertise and application.&#13;
(b) Communications and Community Participation Specialist&#13;
Responsibilities: The Communications Specialist will manage the development of&#13;
information and training materials on hazard awareness, disaster preparedness and&#13;
response, and disaster mitigation for responsible officials at the local level and the general&#13;
public in hazard prone areas. This responsibility will include non-technical descriptions of&#13;
cyclones, floods, and storm surge phenomena and their relationship to disaster damage.&#13;
The Communications Specialist in conjunction with the Hazard Management Specialist&#13;
will develop a range of training programs on response to disaster warnings, disaster&#13;
preparedness and response related to protection of life and property and measure for future&#13;
disaster loss reduction. Training programs will be developed in conjunction with NAID&#13;
(?), Janrnabhoomi, and the Ministry of Education. The Communications Specialist will&#13;
furthermore be primarily responsible for the system of delivery of disaster (cyclone)&#13;
warnings. This warning function will require interaction with radio broadcasters, police,&#13;
the military, and other relevant communications resources. The Communications&#13;
Specialist will also oversee the establishment and expansion of a disaster communications&#13;
system consistent with the broader objective of enhanced, two-way communication with&#13;
the mandal and village level. Through this system and by any other means at hand, the&#13;
AP Hazard Mitigation and Emergency Cyclone Recovery Project&#13;

AP HAZARD MITIGATION AND EMERGENCY CYCLONE RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND THE JANMABHOOMI PROGRAM&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    GOAP's experience has been invaluable in ensuring more effective disaster response, as&#13;
was evident in the aftermath of the November 1996 cyclone. Because of the availability of a&#13;
functioning relief capacity much loss of life was avoided, and speedy relief provided to the affected&#13;
areas. However, most of the resources mobilized to deal with the emergency were in the form of&#13;
cash hand outs and temporary measures to 'patch up' the damage and destruction suffered by the&#13;
infrastructure. While these relief measures are important, they can only address the effects rather&#13;
than the causes of most of the disaster losses.&#13;
2.    The November 1996 cyclone served to highlight the limitations of the existing maintenance&#13;
and repair capacity to cope with emerging circumstances which have intensified environmental&#13;
degradation and vulnerability to natural hazards. Physical infrastructure built many years ago was&#13;
not designed to cope with the excessive rainfall received in November. Additionally, neglect over&#13;
the years has resulted in increased deterioration. As a result many weakened irrigation bunds were&#13;
breached, resulting in widespread flooding. Inadequate maintenance over the years has also&#13;
resulted in many roads, drainage systems and irrigation canals which can hardly meet current&#13;
demands.&#13;
3.    The lack of maintenance is attributed to a variety of factors that would need to be targeted&#13;
if the effects of cyclones and other natural hazards are to be minimized if long-term sustainability&#13;
is to be enhanced. Failure to maintain the physical infrastructure has been mainly associated with a&#13;
decline of public funds available for this activity and the limited involvement of the local users in&#13;
the design and long-term maintenance of the infrastructure.&#13;
FROM DISASTER RELIEF TO LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
4.    Along with the physical rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure, it is necessary to focus&#13;
on a concerted effort to link rehabilitation to long-term mitigation plans which involve local&#13;
communities in more systematic way. If investments are intended to be more than short term&#13;
measures the approach to community development needs to be restructured. In particular,&#13;
rethinking on the following aspects of mitigation planning should be considered: (i) sustainability&#13;
of institutions; (ii) coordination and integration of activities; (iii) community involvement; and (iv)&#13;
government support.&#13;
5.    The institutions that underpin the construction of drains, canals, and roads need to be&#13;
strengthened; the organizations entrusted with their maintenance need to be rethought, and the&#13;
procedures governing citizen participation in their upkeep need to be overhauled. This implies the&#13;
development of an integrated approach to the provision of infrastructure which includes all the&#13;
stakeholders in the elaboration and development of sustainable options - both public and private,&#13;
governmental and non-governmental.&#13;
6.    Coordination of activities at a variety of levels is required - from sub-mandal micro-&#13;
planning and disaster-preparedness activities, to State-wide integrated planning which links the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
relief operations of the State with longer term sustainable development strategies. This involves all&#13;
departments of government working in a more integrated manner to ensure that individual efforts&#13;
do not duplicate or compromise the efforts of others. Integration of activities would also require a&#13;
broader focus that would include not only the coastal zones and delta regions but also the&#13;
watersheds which feed into them. It is evident that environmental degradation upstream and&#13;
excessive run-off, coupled with restricted drainage facilities downstream, have exacerbated the&#13;
negative effects of excessive rain and cyclone damage to irrigation and drainage facilities and to&#13;
roads and physical infrastructure more generally.&#13;
7.     The rhetoric of integrated development, with citizens at the center of decision making, is&#13;
widespread. Translating that rhetoric into reality is difficult. There is evidence that indicates that&#13;
such an integrated approach is being developed in a variety of sectors - as for instance in forestry&#13;
or watershed management. There is a concerted attempt through the Prajala Vaddaku Paalana&#13;
(PVP) and Janmabhoomi programs to combine the traditions of self-help with the development of a&#13;
micro-planning capacity to design and execute small but significant interventions which enhance&#13;
self reliance and sustainability. Small check dams and afforestation programs reduce run off in&#13;
watersheds, periodic clearing of drains prevents waterlogging. But unless these particular one-off&#13;
events are seen as parts of a program which engages citizens in a concerted and sustained way they&#13;
are unlikely to succeed. The challenge is to shift the dominant view from one which focuses on the&#13;
construction of physical assets (or products) to one which emphasizes processes of which these&#13;
products are merely a means to an end.&#13;
8.     While it is recognized that citizens are unlikely to have the expertise to execute and&#13;
maintain large infrastructural investments, it is recognized that they do have a central role to play&#13;
in the 'grass roots' maintenance of physical assets that directly affect their lives. In a resource-poor&#13;
environment, the ability of government to respond to requests decreases and the responsibilities of&#13;
government itself are questioned. The entitlements of citizens are also being rethought as attitudes&#13;
to subsidies and support are renegotiated. Institutions of civil society (Community-based&#13;
organizations, as well as Non-Governmental Organizations) demand greater involvement in&#13;
decisions that affect people's lives. There is greater room for private sector involvement. There is a&#13;
significant restructuring of the ways in which resources are deployed and priorities negotiated.&#13;
TACKLING RISKS AND VULNERABILITY THROUGH STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY&#13;
PARTICIPATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL&#13;
9.     While the present proposal recognizes the importance of restoring assets lost or destroyed&#13;
as the result of a particular disaster, it also wishes to nurture the development of mechanisms that&#13;
can reduce the risks and vulnerabilities that are exposed by such disasters and thus help in their&#13;
long term mitigation. It will do this by strengthening and reorienting existing institutions at State,&#13;
District and Community levels.&#13;
10.   At the community level a program for enhancing the flow of information about the links&#13;
between disaster mitigation and the reduction of long term vulnerability will be developed for&#13;
integrated watershed management and forestry projects in vulnerable areas. A program for the&#13;
development of regular maintenance of minor drainage and canal maintenance will be developed to&#13;
build on existing mechanisms and to enhance citizen control over and involvement in water use in&#13;
the irrigated areas of the deltas of coastal Andhra and in public health and sanitation systems in&#13;
urban areas. The objective would be to make the reduction of vulnerability an integral part of&#13;
community level development activities. The aim of this component of the project is to associate&#13;
the execution of physical works more closely with the local contexts in which they are prioritized.&#13;
Dissociating them from such contexts ignores the processes associated with their identification as&#13;
AP Hazard and Emergency Cyclone Recovery Project&#13;
Attachment 11: Community Involvement and the Janmabhoomi program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
priorities, and the institutions responsible for their execution. More concerted efforts to&#13;
decentralize decision-making about investment priorities will be developed and incorporated into&#13;
district development plans.&#13;
11.    Focus on priority communities. Disasters invariably strike the most vulnerable in ways&#13;
which diminish their abilities to withstand further losses. The project will thus focus more&#13;
systematically on the incorporation of wider elements of civil society (CBOs, NGOs, the private&#13;
sector) into longer term disaster mitigation planning, and to marry such planning with the on-going&#13;
developmental activities at State, district and sub-district levels. The aim would be to enhance local&#13;
ownership of public assets, build up expertise, and strengthen existing institutions in the pursuit of&#13;
more sustainable development. There is evidence to indicate that some forms of economic activity&#13;
serve to exacerbate rather than reduce the risks of loss due to natural disasters, through enhanced&#13;
environmental degradation and a focus on unsustainable activities (over-exploitation of natural&#13;
resources which increase soil erosion, over-concentration on particular species is frequently at the&#13;
expense of bio-diversity).&#13;
12.    From the immediate to the long term. There is a need to disaggregate by event and&#13;
differentiate more systematically between those subject to particular risks before particular courses&#13;
of action can be delineated. First there are those affected by the current cyclone and the inmmediate&#13;
need to attend to their losses and reconstruct their livelihoods (those requiring immediate attention).&#13;
Secondly there are those who are evidently vulnerable to unnatural yet recurring disasters (those&#13;
requiring attention in the medium term, say one to three years). These include those affected by&#13;
flooding as well as those affected by drought as well as those occupying vulnerable locations - on&#13;
'objectionable' land for example. It is usually the marginal and poorest populations within the&#13;
community who are affected most severely and directly - those dry land farmers cultivating the&#13;
most marginal of lands, as well as those local people engaged in the riskiest forms of employment&#13;
in areas where lifeline services are the least adequate - fishermen for example. Thirdly there are&#13;
those activities which need to be incorporated as part of a long-term planning and mitigation&#13;
program. While all three are required, in the current project it is likely that only the first two sets of&#13;
priorities can be systematically addressed. However it is through the project that the foundations&#13;
for the third set of long term priorities might be built.&#13;
CURRENT ACTWIVTIES AIMED AT STRENGTHENING CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT AT THE&#13;
LOCAL LEVEL IN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE STATE.&#13;
13.    There are a number of current interventions in the state aimed at building sustainable&#13;
development at the community level. These have been largely sector-driven with few cross-sectoral&#13;
synergies except where the District Administrations have sought to try and build them. There are&#13;
two Bank projects that are likely to provide a basis for strengthening community participation in&#13;
the State. They are the Andhra Pradesh Forestry Project, which has a growing focus on Joint&#13;
Forest Management, and the District Poverty Initiative Project currently under preparation in six&#13;
districts in the State (viz. Adilabad, Mahboobnagar, Srikakulam, Visianagram, Anantapur and&#13;
Chitoor).&#13;
14.    The Joint Forest Management component of the AP Forestry Project has been&#13;
strengthened following the recent mid-term review of the project. It is anticipated that 1600 Forest&#13;
Protection Committees will be formed under the auspices of the project. Joint Forest Management&#13;
is the development of a partnership between villagers and the Forestry Department for the&#13;
development of degraded forest land with the fruits of such upgradation shared equally between&#13;
villagers and the forest department. This is a major effort to involve those who derive their&#13;
livelihoods from forest products and to allow villagers to be centrally involved in the protection of&#13;
AP Hazard and Emergency Cyclone Recovery Project&#13;
Attachment I 1. Community Involvement and the Janmabhoomi program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
forests. It is a major shift in the ways in which the Forestry Department has traditionally viewed&#13;
the villagers. Recognizing that they are unable to ensure forest protection without the help of&#13;
villagers, they are changing from being policemen of forests to facilitators in their sustainable&#13;
development.&#13;
15.    The District Poverty Initiative Project aims to identify, with the stakeholders at the&#13;
District level, the most marginal and vulnerable populations and target interventions towards them&#13;
in an integrated way. If disaster mitigation is perceived to be an attempt to achieve sustainability&#13;
by reducing vulnerability and risk to natural hazards, then the approach being adopted by the&#13;
project is closely allied to that being suggested by the Hazard Mitigation and Emergency Cyclone&#13;
Recovery Project. The District Poverty Initiative Project makes central use of Social Assessments&#13;
as an instrument for the involvement of local communities in defining their priorities. The work is&#13;
being carried out with the help of local NGOs and social sc ence research organizations in the&#13;
State. These Social Assessments will provide the template on which an integrated development&#13;
strategy for support of the most vulnerable will be built.&#13;
16.   Other government programs. Both projects build on more conventional interventions to&#13;
alleviate poverty and create development opportunities, such as the Integrated Rural Development&#13;
Program, the Drought Prone Areas Program, the Integrated Child Development Services Program,&#13;
the Employment Guarantee Scheme, the Weaker Section Housing Program, and the DWCRA&#13;
savings and credit program.&#13;
17.   Recent State initiatives. Additionally the current State government has placed&#13;
considerable emphasis on engaging the cooperation of citizens in government programs, in&#13;
enhancing self reliance and in village or neighborhood micro-planning activities. There is a&#13;
tradition of collective work for community projects (shramdan). The Prajala Vaddaku Paalana&#13;
(PVP) program ('Government at the doorstep of the People') was launched at the beginning of&#13;
November in 1995. Its aim was to link people's participation in the decision making process by&#13;
responding to people's needs and enhancing the accountability of government agents to the people.&#13;
Three rounds of the PVP Program were held in November and December of 1995 and in February&#13;
1996. These involved visits by representatives of the district administration to each settlement with&#13;
a population of more than 200. The results of the program were mixed but they provided important&#13;
opportunities for citizens to criticize government work, and to suggest ways in which they might&#13;
contribute to government efforts through 'shramadanam' activities. Two 'shramadanam' drives&#13;
were held in January and July of 1996&#13;
18.    Building on these efforts government launched the 'Janmabhoomi 'program at the&#13;
beginning of January 1997. This involved an intensive village outreach exercise held between 1st&#13;
and 8th of /January. It aimed to build on the PVP and 'shramadanam' initiatives, and is inspired by&#13;
the community development program ('Saemaul Undong') developed in South Korea in the 1970s.&#13;
The focus of the Janmabhoomi program is on participatory micro-planning as a basis for collective&#13;
prioritizing and for building the capacity of local level administrative capacity through the&#13;
Panchayati Raj system. Under this system many powers and responsibilities are to be devolved to&#13;
the Panchayat level. The government recognizes that:&#13;
"for social development to take place effectively and on a sustainable basis, close&#13;
involvement and participation of the people as well as planning and action at the&#13;
grassroots level is essential." I&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

19.    Development is perceived as more than the construction of civil works. Emphasis is placed&#13;
on strengthening the Panchayati Raj institutions which are seen as the:&#13;
"idealframeworkforformulation, planning and execution of the programs of&#13;
economic development and social justice, as they are ideal institutions for convergence,&#13;
integration, prioritization and coordination of the programs at the grass-roots level&#13;
for ensuring prompt and efficient delivery of the services to the beneficiaries. Active&#13;
participation of the people through the institution of Gram Sabhas (village assemblies) in&#13;
the set up would ensure transparency and accountability of the system and, therefore, the&#13;
Gram Sabhas should be strengthened " 2&#13;
20.    The content of the Janmabhoomi program focuses on ten basic minimum needs, the&#13;
seven defined in the 9th Five Year plan (e.g., safe drinking water, primary health care, primary&#13;
education, public housing assistance, basic nutrition through the midday meals program,&#13;
electrification of all settlements, and streanlining the Public Distribution System (PDS)) along&#13;
with growth and growth-related infrastructure, employment and social security. The program had&#13;
three basic components:&#13;
(a) PVP - obtaining representations from the people and indicating actions taken following&#13;
previous visits&#13;
(b) Shramadanam - with a focus on collective village and ward cleaning with a focus on&#13;
general cleanliness involving cleaning of drains, tackling water stagnation, repairs to&#13;
drinking water sources, garbage disposal as well as maintenance of trees&#13;
(c) Micro-planning - the collection of basic data about the settlements as sensitization of&#13;
villagers to the availability of government programs, followed by the development of an&#13;
action plan for the coming years (what can be immediately achieved and what is required&#13;
over a five year time period). Cooperation with all development agencies such as local&#13;
NGOs, village committees of one sort or another, in the achievement of these goals is&#13;
sought&#13;
21.   The January 1997 Janmabhoomi exercise provided a timely forum for initiating systematic&#13;
Vulnerability Assessments and understanding people's livelihood strategies, their priorities in&#13;
dealing with disaster-preparedness and their willingness to join with Government in overcoming the&#13;
threats of frequently recurring disasters. From this exercise a more systematic plan for priority&#13;
intervention can be drawn up. Priorities for immediate, medium and long term interventions can be&#13;
assessed with the people themselves. NGOs should be encouraged to be involved wherever they are&#13;
available and willing to link with the systematization of this intervention. The exercise reached&#13;
56,366 habitations of 200 persons or more and undertook 434,979 'sramadanam works' with an&#13;
approximate value of Rs. 49 million. Over 2,500,000 people are estimated to have been involved.&#13;
The exercise has generated a formidable data base on which future activities for village&#13;
development are to be based and has generated considerable local enthusiasm.&#13;
22.    Cross-sectoral community involvement. Proposals for physical infrastructural&#13;
investments under the project can be systematically linked to micro-level plans for rehabilitation&#13;
and disaster preparedness which can be perceived as continuities of the current direction. Emphasis&#13;
should be given to the rehabilitation of community assets and on attempts to obtain the systematic&#13;
involvement of local groups in this work. The focus for such plans will vary from the construction&#13;
of flood banks to wasteland development and more effective watershed management. Major&#13;
attention needs to be given to the formation of water user groups and to ensuring that they pay&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
systematic attention to disaster-preparedness in their on-going work. The aim would be to provide&#13;
cross-sectoral community involvement in a variety of sectorally determined programs wherever&#13;
possible. Matrix I (included at the end of this attachment) identifies the sectoral proposals and the&#13;
potential areas for greater community participation and cross sectoral interventions. A template for&#13;
a program for disaster mitigation/sustainable development can thus be developed at the community&#13;
level.&#13;
23.    Community involvement in regeneration offorest cover, and coastal zone shelter belt&#13;
consolidation. Part of the project proposal relates to the work of the Forestry Department in&#13;
regenerating denuded forest cover, and in consolidating the coastal zone forest belt. These activities&#13;
are not dealt with under the current AP Forestry Project being undertaken with Bank assistance.&#13;
There is considerable room in both the regeneration of forest cover, and in the consolidation of the&#13;
coastal forest belt for community participation on similar lines to those currently being dealt with&#13;
in the State under Joint Forest Management Schemes. These schemes involve the development of&#13;
Forest Protection Committees at the village level to jointly manage denuded forest areas around the&#13;
village and share in the products thus derived.&#13;
24.    Coastal Zone Shelter Belts. At least two of the seven objectives proposed are conducive&#13;
to greater community participation (e.g., making fuel, fodder and construction materials available&#13;
to the people, and improving the economic status and living conditions of the people.). It is noted&#13;
that seedlings will be distributed to the community, and that large numbers of fodder, fuel and&#13;
small seedlings will be raised and distributed to the people free of cost. It is assumed that the&#13;
beneficiaries will help in the development of seedling nurseries. Detailed proposals for rewarding&#13;
beneficiaries are given in the proposal. Efforts will also be made to educate people through mass&#13;
publicity, audio visual aids, seminars, workshops, field visits and training programs to get the&#13;
meaningful support of the people. Special efforts will be made to enlist women's participation and&#13;
the existing women's thrift and credit institutions may be used as entry points&#13;
25.    As noted in the Government's proposal the raising of shelter belts requires a good mix of&#13;
strategic interventions and tools. Rather than merely seeing local people as 'beneficiaries' of&#13;
department largesse it is perhaps more in the spirit of self reliance and sustainability to encourage&#13;
partnerships with local people to make them guardians of the forest cover in return for access to&#13;
forest products on a sustainable basis, and with the active support and facilitation of the Forest&#13;
Department. Through partnerships with people the department can build local support for the&#13;
development of forest cover and thereby avoid pilferage. Wherever possible, on new plantations as&#13;
well as on those being regenerated the active partnership of the local populations will be solicited&#13;
and arrangements made for local access to forest products. The principles underpinning the Joint&#13;
Forest Management schemes being developed elsewhere in the State should serve as a model for&#13;
these activities, and local responsibility for sustainable forest cover encouraged&#13;
26.    Watershed Management in Critically Water Starved Areas. The project proposal points&#13;
to a long history of excessive land use, through agriculture and animal husbandry which has&#13;
resulted in depletion of renewable natural resources (soil, water and forests). The objectives of this&#13;
part of the project are to restore degraded forest areas in order to meet the wants of local people&#13;
and with the willing cooperation of neighboring villagers, participatory management of forest&#13;
resources is envisaged. The following components are envisaged:&#13;
(i) raising of fuel, fruit, fibers and NTFPs;&#13;
(ii) reforestation and soil and moisture conservation work on barren hills;&#13;
(iii) seedling distribution and planting on marginal farm lands, field bunds and homesteads;&#13;
and&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
(iv) publicity and extension work.&#13;
27.    There are multiple opportunities for the development of partnerships between the Forest&#13;
Department and the local people, considering that local users of the forests can become their best&#13;
guardians. The work of policing and regenerating degraded forest land can be shared by both sets&#13;
of stakeholders. Pilferage and smuggling by outsiders can thus be minimized and sustainable forest&#13;
development encouraging which will result in a decrease in run-off and of flash floods thereby&#13;
mitigating some of the effects of excessive rainfall.&#13;
28.    District Disaster Mangement Committtees (DDMC) for Natural Hazard/Vulnerability&#13;
Reduction. DDMCs will be developed at the District level to link vulnerability reduction/hazard&#13;
mitigation with environmental protection and wider development efforts proposed through the&#13;
evolving Janmabhoomi program. The State accepts that one of the aims of the Janmabhoomi&#13;
program is the reduction of vulnerability from natural hazards. The DDMC will consist of the Joint&#13;
Collector, the APSRAC representative, the concemed revenue officers, the CEO of the Zilla&#13;
Parishad and other officers involved in relief operations, in addition to the District Rural&#13;
Development Officer and Forest Officer. It will act as the nodal agency for: (i) disaster&#13;
preparedness; (ii) responding to particular disasters; (iii) recovery from particular disasters; and&#13;
(iv) mitigating the effects of natural hazards and reducing vulnerability.&#13;
THE DEVELOPMENT OF VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS/AUDITS FOR INTEGRATED&#13;
MICRO-PLANNING FOR DISASTER PREPAREDNESS&#13;
29.    These will be the first stages in the development and implementation of a&#13;
hazard/vulnerability reduction strategy. These will provide, inter alia:&#13;
(i)    a social audit of vulnerability, and the bases for the development of indicators to measure&#13;
declining risk and vulnerability. (This will include a quality audit of existing provision);&#13;
(ii)   an analysis of the social capital and institutional capacity available in communities for&#13;
mobilizing community support for disaster mitigation;&#13;
(iii)   an inventory of organizations/institutions available at the localtmandal level to deal with&#13;
the 'up-stream' and 'down-stream' issues associated with Disaster-preparedness;&#13;
(iv)   an inventory of existing and proposed schemes that can be used as bases for short,&#13;
medium, and long-term rehabilitation;&#13;
(v)   the identification of 'focal points' in the local communities for disaster preparedness and&#13;
sustainable development;&#13;
(vi)  the bases for transforming local relief operations into longer term disaster-preparedness&#13;
and mitigation efforts;&#13;
(vii)  an understanding of the immediate human resources required in the District Administration&#13;
to address longer term development efforts;&#13;
(viii)  the basis for the development of educational and training efforts to address longer term&#13;
environmental improvement programs - environmental education linked to particular&#13;
prioritized sets of activities;&#13;
(ix)   the basis for commissioning of studies/action programs in particular priority districts with&#13;
the help of national and intemational institutions.&#13;

OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PARTICIPATORY VULNERABILITY&#13;
ASSESSMENTS/AUDITS&#13;
30.    A Participatory Vulnerability Assessment (PVA)is a time-bound integrated set of activities&#13;
aimed at:&#13;
(i)    analyzing the causes of vulnerability;&#13;
(ii)   vulnerability mapping - identifying vulnerable groups, activities, areas within the&#13;
community with the community's own involvement through participatory appraisal&#13;
methods;&#13;
(iii)   contributing to the elaboration of a set of vulnerability priorities (short, medium and long&#13;
term) to be addressed;&#13;
(iv)   engaging all stakeholders in the process of participatory assessment;&#13;
(v)    reviewing the successes and failures of current programs;&#13;
(vi)   establishing criteria and methods for identifying vulnerable groups, activities and areas;&#13;
(vii)  developing reliable indicators for vulnerability reduction which can be used to evaluate&#13;
progress over time, and act as benchmarks for achievements;&#13;
(viii)  identifying the practical boundaries around which realistic activities can be accomplished&#13;
(e.g. small watersheds and drainage systems;&#13;
(ix)   identifying extemalities likely to impede vulnerability reduction (upstream effects of flash&#13;
floods, upstream silting, soil erosion, forest cover denudation,&#13;
(x)    advise on institutional mechanisms appropriate for channeling support.&#13;
31.    The Vulnerability Assessments will be carried out under the auspices of the proposed State&#13;
Disaster Mitigation Agency with technical support from appropriate professional institutions&#13;
including the Academy of Rural Development. Wherever possible local NGOs and associated&#13;
research capacity will be utilized to facilitate their execution. Work plans, participatory research&#13;
methodologies and participatory approaches cannot be defined in any detail as they will be&#13;
expected to reflect particular local realities.&#13;
PILOT VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS&#13;
32.   In order to map out the potential ways in which a vulnerability assessment might be&#13;
approached, three pilot assessments will be undertaken in three contrasting districts - one where the&#13;
effects of the cyclone were most acute, and where flash flooding caused most damage and one&#13;
representing a drought prone area (West Godavari, Khammam and Anantapur Districts for&#13;
example). These pilot assessments would provide important information about the parameters of&#13;
vulnerability analysis in the three regions of Andhra Pradesh (The Andhra Coast, Telengana and&#13;
Rayalaseema). Two villages at different level of development will be chosen in each of the Districts&#13;
providing a total of six case studies. These case studies will be used as a base for elaborating the&#13;
strategy of the September 1997 Jahnmabhoomi exercise. This latter will act as the launch pad for a&#13;
more sustained approach to vulnerability assessment. The objectives of the pilot studies in&#13;
vulnerability assessment are to:&#13;
(i)   to elaborate participatory methodologies for use in scaling up the experiment&#13;
(ii)   to work through the modalities of implementing such assessments&#13;
(iii)  to map out the likely costs of the production of vulnerability action plans&#13;

(iv)   the types of interventions to be chosen in reducing vulnerability from natural hazards&#13;
(v)    to assess the likely training needs required for scaling up this exercise&#13;
The studies will be carried out by a multi-disciplinary team consisting of:&#13;
(a)    a forest officer&#13;
(b)    an IAS officer of the rank of Collector&#13;
(c)    an engineer of the rank of superintending executive engineer&#13;
(d)    an NGO representative with expertise in Participatory Assessment methods&#13;
(e)    a Communications expert&#13;
(f)    local facilitators to be chosen and oriented in advance&#13;
33.    At least 2 women would be part of this team. The exercise would be conducted over a&#13;
period of three months and would be completed by mid June in time to feed the results into the&#13;
planning process for the September round of the Janmabhoomi exercise. These pilot studies will&#13;
involve three stages:&#13;
34.    The collection, compilation and analysis of all available information about vulnerability in&#13;
a particular community (including GIS data, data from the last Janmabhoomi exercise, as well as&#13;
information where appropriate and available on the environmental context in which the community&#13;
is located, and information available in the Revenue office - to take one month&#13;
35.    The presentation of this information to the community, and the development, through&#13;
participatory appraisal methodologies, of a draft action plan. - to take one month. The&#13;
representation to the community of the results of the vulnerability assessment for comments and&#13;
amendments, and the development of a costed, time bound development plan for the next five&#13;
years, indicating sources of finance, proposed community contributions, priority interventions,&#13;
institutional arrangements. - to take one month. These pilot studies should also provide the basis&#13;
for the elaboration of a 'Vulnerability Index' through which interventions might be prioritized as&#13;
vulnerability assessments and Action Plans are expanded in the State&#13;
36.   Assessment of Training Needs. Following the pilot studies an assessment of training&#13;
needs will be undertaken with the assistance of national and international experts. The results of&#13;
the training needs assessment will be the basis for building a State training capacity and&#13;
strengthening existing institutions within the State to undertake such training and effectively&#13;
support District activities in Vulnerability Reduction&#13;

AP HAZARD MITIGATION AND EMERGENCY CYCLONE RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
ENHANCED DESIGN STANDARDS&#13;
1.     Given the recurring nature of cyclones and floods in AP, and the continuous damages that&#13;
they inflict upon vital infrastructure, enhanced design criteria and cyclone/flood conscious siting&#13;
are proposed under the project. All infrastructure restoration financed under the project would be&#13;
designed to the standards indicated below. It would be the responsibility of the DMU to ensure that&#13;
the implementing agencies use these standards without exception. In addition to its rn-house&#13;
resources, the DMU will use the services of consultants including the Quality Assurance consultant&#13;
to ensure compliance and certification.&#13;
ELECTRICITY&#13;
2.     The existing electricity network, namely 33 and 11 KV lines, are designed for a wind&#13;
pressure of 100 kg/m2 and a wind load of 280 kg. The transmission towers are designed for a&#13;
wind pressure of 150 kg/m2. The criteria proposed with regard to electrical installations is to&#13;
make the towers and distribution lines capable of withstanding higher wind speeds (e.g., cyclonic&#13;
velocities). Respectively, pressure and wind load resistance will be increased to 220 kg/m2 for the&#13;
lines and to 500 kg for the transmission towers comprising the sections of the network included in&#13;
the project. The REC has laid down the specifications which will be adopted. Existing and&#13;
enhanced criteria for this component are compared in Table I below.&#13;

ROADS&#13;
3.    The Roads and Bridges (R&amp;B) component comprises State and Panchyati (PR) roads,&#13;
which fall under the responsibility of the R&amp;B Department and the PR Engineering Department,&#13;
respectively. With regard to roads, the specifications prescribed by MOST and the Indian Road&#13;
Congress (IRC) are proposed to be adopted for the project. The specifications for PR roads and&#13;
R&amp;B roads are indicated in Table 3a and 3b at the end of this attachment.&#13;
BUILDINGS&#13;
4.    Works under this component include the repair and reconstruction of collapsed / damaged&#13;
public buildings such as schools, health centers and hospitals which fall under the R&amp;B and PR&#13;
administration in the affected districts. The reconstruction of buildings will generally be done&#13;
under the Indian Standard specifications, namely IS-456, IS-875 and IS-1893. The dead and live&#13;
loads and wind loads of all combinations will be computed and the worst case will be assumed for&#13;
the design. Wind speeds consistent with the Indian Standard Code, but not less than 200 km/h -&#13;
the wind speeds experienced in the recent cyclone.&#13;
5.    In general, the buildings included in this component are proposed with RCC frame with&#13;
deeper foundation on elevated grounds as to avoid submergence of the main structure during a&#13;
cyclonic event. A richer concrete mix of M 200 will be used, Building specifications for other&#13;
components, which are currently in use and specified in the National Building Code (NBC) will be&#13;
adopted in all the works proposed under the project. Other building practices that would be adopted&#13;
are: larger cover to reinforcing bars, better compacting of concrete, improved design of roof&#13;
covering with shorter eaves to prevent uplift, appropriate roof slopes and stronger anchoring.&#13;
CYCLONE SHELTERS&#13;
6.    The shelters are designed as RCC frame structures with non-load bearing filler walls.&#13;
Specific structural details are as follows:&#13;
(a) Loads: The shelter is designed for a basic wind pressure of 350 kg/m2 as per IS: 875-11964.&#13;
However, the reduction in basic wind pressure recommended in clause 4.2.2, Part IV, of the&#13;
National Building Code of India is not considered to ensure the extra safety of the building during a&#13;
cyclone. Floor and roof are designed for a live load of 500 kg/m2 as per Is-875-1964.&#13;
(b) Foundations: The structure shall be supported by under-reamed pile foundations with the top&#13;
of the pile cap at 2 feet below ground level to keep the piles free from scouring action. The piles&#13;
and pile caps are designed as per IS-2911-1973.&#13;
(c) Design Criteria: The RCC members are designed on the basis of ultimate strength (estimated&#13;
using the appropriate load factors recommended in IS-4566-1964). Frames are analyzed by using&#13;
the stiffness matrix method using computer-aided design.&#13;
(d) Design Stress Adopted:&#13;
(i) concrete - M200 grade with a cube strength of 200 kg per sq.cm.&#13;
(ii) steel - TOR steel grade 40 with yield stress of 4250 kg per sq.cm. Under reamed piles&#13;
are designed using mild steel.&#13;
(e) The designs furnished are for guidance during execution and shall be checked prior to execution&#13;
and safety ensured with reference to field conditions.&#13;

An independent structural engineer will be employed to check design solutions developed&#13;
by the Departments.&#13;
DRAINAGE AND FLOOD BANKS&#13;
7.     The Indian Standard Institution specifies the recommended design criteria. The guidelines&#13;
prescribed under the relevant IS Codes will be followed. The list of IS codes proposed for use are&#13;
presented in Table 2 below. The design standards and criteria for the works included in this&#13;
component would be monitored with respect to the outcome of the proposed hazard reduction&#13;
studies. The latter would help ensure that through improved design criteria, construction practices&#13;
and quality control measures, infrastructure will withstand future disasters better. The Planning,&#13;
Design and Monitoring Unit (PDMU) and the Quality Control Unit (QCU) of the Irrigation and&#13;
CAD Department will, in consultation with the required consultants, specify what standards should&#13;
be finally applied regarding flood control and drainage works.&#13;

I PROCUREMENT RSPONANGEMIEIES&#13;
PROCUREMENT RESPONSIBILITIES&#13;
1.    Infrastructure components will be implemented through the sector departments under the&#13;
overall coordination of the DMU. The sector departments will submit tenders decisions above the&#13;
prescribed limits of the Chief Engineers to the Cofmiittee of Secretaries through the DMU. The&#13;
DMU will function as the secretariat for the Committee and arrange for the reviews.&#13;
2.    The DMU will use the services of the already functioning PMU (with its two procurement&#13;
engineers) for procurement matters and to process procurement documentation for the Committee&#13;
of Secretaries.&#13;
3.    Flood Control and Drainage: All works within this component will be implemented by&#13;
the Irrigation and CAD Department. Implementation activities of the reconstruction program will&#13;
be managed by the Chief Engineer (CE), who will report directly to the DMU. The CE will be&#13;
assisted by Superintending Engineers, Executive Engineers, Supporting Engineers and a Quality&#13;
Control Unit (QCU). Since this component's activities cover eight districts, a Planning, Design&#13;
and Monitoring Unit (PDMU) will be established within the Department for (i) coordination with&#13;
the DMU; (ii) inter-district coordination; (iii) monitoring of the construction program; (iv)&#13;
submission of reimbursement applications; (v) preparation of quarterly reports; and (vi)&#13;
appointment of consultants. The CE will directly supervise the activities of the Quality Control&#13;
Unit (QCU) of the Department, created to make recommendations regarding construction standards&#13;
and methods, and to ensure their implementation in the field.&#13;
4.     Electricity (Transmission and Distribution): The APSEB will undertake the&#13;
implementation of works under this component. The cost of each estimate for the procurement&#13;
program will, in this case, exceed the powers of sanction of the Chief Engineer, and they will&#13;
therefore be approved by the Board. The Board will enhance the powers of the CE and arrange to&#13;
clear award decisions within a week of their submission to the Board. Alternatively, decisions on&#13;
contracts larger than an agreed threshold will be referred to the DMU and the Committee of&#13;
Secretaries.&#13;
5.    Roads and Buildings: A specialized organizational setup, headed by the Chief Engineer&#13;
will be established to ensure that the construction program is timely accomplished. This&#13;
organizational setup will include four circles (each covering a certain number of districts) and 12&#13;
Executive Divisions with 38 subdivisions. The specialized circles will also attend to the works&#13;
included under the Buildings component. The Panchayati Raj (PR) Engineering Department will&#13;
handle rural roads, PR public buildings and the cyclone shelters.&#13;
COMMITTEE OF SECRETARIES&#13;
6.     Under the project, the Committee of Secretaries, with a similar structure and powers as the&#13;
Committee created for the implementation of the CERP, will be established. The competence of&#13;
the Chief Engineers will be limited to the approval of tenders up to 25 percent in excess of the&#13;
estimated rates. The Committee of Secretaries will have full powers to approve tenders which fall&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
beyond the financial competence of the Chief Engineers. Members of the Committee would be&#13;
Secretary (Finance), Secretary Works and Projects, and the Secretary of the concerned department.&#13;
The Committee of Secretaries will met about once ever ten days.&#13;
FUNDS FLOW ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
7     The schemes included in the project will be clearly listed under the functional budgetary&#13;
head of each department to ensure their identity. The procedure for release of funds to the various&#13;
departments depends upon the institutions or departments executing the scheme. In the case of&#13;
works departments, such as Irrigation or Roads &amp; Buildings, allocations are made through a&#13;
system of Letter of Credit. In this case, the Works and Project Wing of the Finance Department&#13;
will issue an authorization to the Chief Engineer indicating the amount of funds needed for project&#13;
implementation by the respective Department for a given period. In turn, the Chief Engineer /&#13;
Head of the Department will distribute the amount - also in the form of an authorization - among&#13;
the various field functionaries, e.g., Executive Engineers, who are the ones directly making the&#13;
payments for the work carried out at this level.&#13;
8.    In the case of the Forest Department, the expenditure is incurred by the Field Officers&#13;
through a system of issue of cheques to the extent of funds placed at their disposal. For the&#13;
APSEB, funds are released by way of a loan through a government order.&#13;
9.     Each of the Departments or Agencies receiving funds under the project will summarize&#13;
every month their project expenses and furnish it to the DMU within five days of the completion of&#13;
the month for submission of reimbursement claims.&#13;

PERFORMANCE MONITORING   ICATORS   777:7f&#13;
1.    Two kinds of indicators would be considered for monitoring progress of the proposed&#13;
project: (i) program performance indicators, which allow the evaluation of progress made toward&#13;
the fulfillment of the stated short, medium and long-term mitigation and recovery objectives, as&#13;
described for each of the proposed project components; and (ii) project performance indicators,&#13;
which measure the flow of the project with respect to procurement procedures, contract preparation&#13;
and approval, and general disbursement issues. When necessary, initial values of some&#13;
performance indicators would be established to provide a baseline to evaluate the extent to which&#13;
target values for each objective are being met.&#13;
PROGRAM PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
2.     The natural hazard mitigation objectives of the project require indicators to measure&#13;
progress toward cyclone and flood vulnerability reduction in the target areas. This implies the need&#13;
to measure advances in the Hazard Management Program including (i) undertaking of the hazard&#13;
studies and development of action plans; and (ii) social, environmental and economic issues such as&#13;
levels of community involvement, enhancement of institutional capacity for disaster management,&#13;
changes in peoples' disaster perception and in their attitudes toward disaster mitigation, as well as&#13;
community and government commitment to sustaining mitigation works through the amounts&#13;
channeled via the Vulnerability Reduction Fund. This type of indicators, illustrated below,&#13;
requires field work. The restoration objectives require the measurement of the extent to which&#13;
essential assets of the road, drainage and electricity networks that were affected by the recent&#13;
disaster are being timely and appropriately repaired and/or reconstructed.&#13;

involvement of CBOs, NGOs and the public at large in disaster management planning, and to&#13;
ensure that public campaigns are being undertaken to raise people's awareness regarding cyclone&#13;
and flood hazards. To gather the necessary information to measure progress toward these ends a&#13;
monitoring plan has been devised. This plan would include activities to measure:&#13;
(i) changes in peoples ' hazard awareness. A survey would be administered at the&#13;
beginning of project implementation in a selected area in East Godavari, before any&#13;
specific campaign is initiated, to establish a baseline. Questionnaires would be&#13;
administered every year up to the end of the project, for a total of 4 measurements.&#13;
(ii) levels of community involvement and commitment A series of workshops would be&#13;
organized to engage people at the comnmunity level in disaster management planning. These&#13;
workshops should include CBOs, local NGOs, and other community groups, with especial&#13;
emphasis on the most vulnerable population segments The workshops would enable the&#13;
AP Hazard Mitigation and Emergency Cyclone Recovery Project&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
creation of a database with the profiles of participants, from which a representative sample&#13;
can be interviewed to measure the extent to which they understand the relevance of&#13;
collaborating with government in the disaster mitigation schemes being put in place.&#13;
(iii) changes in peoples 'perceptions. A panel study would be designed to follow up a&#13;
specific community in two of the most vulnerable districts, and a specialized instrument&#13;
would be administered throughout project implementation. Visits would be done according&#13;
to the schedule for the public campaign and the dissemination of the results of the&#13;
vulnerability studies.&#13;
(iv) degree of commitment to long-term mitigation objectives on the part of govemment&#13;
officials at the sub-district level. Structured interviews with a selected sample of officials&#13;
from the two most affected districts would be undertaken at the start, middle and end of&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
PROJECT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
4.     Proposed indicators to monitor project performance would be:&#13;
(i) Average duration of procurement procedures from launching of bids to contract awards&#13;
(in calendar days) by year&#13;
(ii) Average duration of preparation, signature and approval of contracts (in calendar days)&#13;
by year&#13;
(iii) Percentage of contracts implemented within the scheduled time frame (by year)&#13;
(iv) Percentage of contracts implemented with no cost overrun (by year)&#13;
(v) Percentage of payments processed or transmitted to the Bank within 30 days after&#13;
receipt of invoice or due date (by year)&#13;

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES&#13;
32.    When completed, the project should broadly have developed the following main results.&#13;
(i)    design criteria to be adopted for irrigation structures, drains and flood banks etc.,&#13;
to withstand cyclone, wind, floods and storm surges.&#13;
(ii)    broad ranges of intensities of hazard factors for application of new design criteria.&#13;
(iii)   cost-benefit relationships with application of the recommended design criteria.&#13;
(iv)   feasibility report on varying design criteria within the vulnerable zones.&#13;
(v)    design criteria and construction practices for high risk areas.&#13;
(vi)   special provisions, that may be found necessary, for enforcement of the new&#13;
design criteria.&#13;
(vii)   uniform building code for high risk and coastal area.&#13;
33.    The existing practices of design of infrastructure relating to:&#13;
(i)    Irrigation and drainage generally conform to Indian standards on various disciplines, such&#13;
as river valley development and civil engineering materials etc. Wind forces, flood frequencies,&#13;
storm-run-off, hydraulic and structural design of structures, energy dissipation arrangements, soil&#13;
engineering and foundation design etc. form the core group parameters. A Classified List of Indian&#13;
Standards on River Valley Development and Civil Engineering published by the Bureau of Indian&#13;
standards, New Delhi, can be a good source of standards available on these topics. The design&#13;
procedures also refer to standard text books, such as Open Channel Hydraulics and Hydrology&#13;
Handbook by Vente Chow and various other standard textbooks on hydraulics, soil mechanics,&#13;
structural engineering, etc. Certain Manuals, e.g., Guidelines for Estimation of Flood Discharges&#13;
published by CWC are good reference sources whenever special problems are encountered for&#13;
design studies undertaken at institutions like CWPRS (in Pune) and APERL (in Hyderabad).&#13;
(ii)    Buildings being constructed by R&amp;B and Panchayati Raj Departments conform to&#13;
National Buildings Code (NBC), Indian Standards codes on Reinforced cement concrete, wind&#13;
forces, seismic forces, foundations etc., and&#13;
(iii)   The Roads conform to the specifications indicated by the Ministry of Surface Transport&#13;
(MOST) and Indian Roads Congress (IRC) and standard text books/codes on pavement designs.&#13;
34.    Sectional Committees of Bureau of Indian Standards periodically review the codes of&#13;
practice and revise if found necessary.&#13;
35.    Special solutions for design of foundations of structures where soils met with negligible&#13;
shear parameters or near nil values in coastal districts drains are often arrived at by indigenous&#13;
methods - which require refined solutions.&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
36.    Consultant's services will cover: roads and bridges, irrigation and drainage, electric&#13;
facilities, water supply and sewerage facilities, and public and private buildings (including multi-&#13;
story buildings).&#13;
37.    The Consultant will specifically:&#13;
(a)    Review and document design criteria and construction practices for each&#13;
infrastructure subsector that would have a linkage to hazards such as cyclone,&#13;
wind, floods and storm surge;&#13;
AP Hazard Mitigation and Emergency Cyclone Recovery Project&#13;

(b)    Document the intensity and frequency of occurrences of each of the hazard factors&#13;
and prepare broad ranges of their intensities for application of the new design&#13;
criteria, in agreement with the infrastructure construction agencies,&#13;
regulating agencies (such as the Relief Commissioner) Central and concerned&#13;
State agencies and in conformity with up-to-date hazard maps available;&#13;
(c)    Conduct sensitivity analyses to determine the cost and benefit relationship for the&#13;
enhanced design criteria and construction practices, clearly indicating which of the&#13;
factors are essential;&#13;
(d)    Using available hazard maps determine the high risk areas to each type of hazard,&#13;
and investigate the feasibility of varying design criteria within the vulnerable&#13;
zones;&#13;
(e)    Recommend for each infrastructure sub-sector, the design criteria and&#13;
construction practices suitable for use in clearly demarcated vulnerable high risk&#13;
areas of Andhra Pradesh;&#13;
(f)    Specify any special provisions required for enforcement of the new design criteria;&#13;
and&#13;
(h)    Prepare a draft Coastal and High Risk Area Uniform Building Code.&#13;

Modeling and Analysis&#13;
OBJECTIVE&#13;
41.   The objective of this study is to improve the scientific and operational capability of the&#13;
India Meteorological Department (IMD) and to provide timely, complete and accurate predictions&#13;
of critical characteristics of cyclonic storms in the Bay of Bengal. The addition of six Doppler&#13;
radar stations covering the coastal area of AP will provide new information on the location and&#13;
intensity of cyclones approaching the coast. These data along with improved satellite monitoring&#13;
of weather systems in the Bay of Bengal will make possible the improvement of event specific&#13;
predictions of landfall, rainfall and wind speed. This improved information will facilitate the&#13;
modeling of cyclones and their associated impacts and the identification of areas exposed to&#13;
potentially damaging wind and flooding.&#13;
42.   Modeling of the cyclone process makes possible the real time estimation of projected&#13;
rainfall and storm surge. This information when related to adequate topographic mapping permits&#13;
to identify high risk hazard zones. Detailed mapping of high risk hazard zones may be used to&#13;
direct population and investment to relatively safer areas, thus reducing future disaster losses.&#13;
SCOPE&#13;
43.   This modeling and analysis will include the meteorological and oceanographic aspects of&#13;
the cyclone phenomenon. First priority is given to the application of modeling and analysis to&#13;
phenomena likely to affect the territory of Andhra Pradesh. This work should lead to a general&#13;
enhancement of cyclone prediction and forecasting in the region.&#13;
44.   The modeling effort will require extensive meteorological, topographical, hydrological and&#13;
bathymetrical data as input. Access to this material, where it is available, and collection of&#13;
relevant data when unavailable, are critical to the success of the project. IMD's must lead a&#13;
coordinated effort of key GOI organizations including the Survey of India, the Department of&#13;
Ocean Development and the Central Water Commission in order to accomplish this task.&#13;

OBJECTIVE&#13;
50.   The long term objective of this study is to achieve sustained and effective flood&#13;
forecasting, flood control and water management in the coastal zone, the Krishna and Godavari&#13;
Deltas and upland watersheds subject to flash flooding; thus protecting human lives, crops,&#13;
property and infrastructure investments.&#13;
SCOPE&#13;
51.   This project includes three-interrelated areas: (i) the coastal zone which includes the&#13;
roughly 1000 km coast of Andhra Pradesh and ancillary areas inland (including all areas subject to&#13;
coastal flooding); (ii) the deltas of the Krishna and Godavari rivers (which include the coastal zone&#13;
areas); and (iii) upland watershed subject to flash flooding. These upland watersheds contribute to&#13;
the hydrologic systems of the deltas and the coastal zone.&#13;
52.   The primary focus of the study is to introduce hazard related information into the&#13;
integrated, comprehensive programs associated with these three areas. This work will be&#13;
conducted largely on the basis of data specific to Andhra Pradesh. Leadership will lie with state&#13;
level agencies such as the Irrigation and Drainage Department. Substantial input would be&#13;
expected from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Central Water&#13;
Commission(CWC).&#13;

OBJECTIVES&#13;
58.    The objective of the study would be to evolve appropriate design and construction&#13;
standards for transmission, distribution and substation facilities in the coastal areas of Andhra&#13;
Pradesh to mitigate the impact of cyclones and floods that frequently hit the coast. Specifically,&#13;
the consultant(s) conducting the study will:&#13;
*  Review existing design criteria and construction practices&#13;
* Review international practices for design and construction of facilities in disaster prone areas.&#13;
*  Select possible design criteria that may be applicable to Andhra Pradesh.&#13;
* Evaluate the cost/benefits of different alternatives.&#13;
*  Review intensity and frequency of floods and cyclones and classify areas into different risk&#13;
zones.&#13;
*  Recommend appropriate design criteria and construction practices for different areas.&#13;
*  Apply these to existing facilities and future plans.&#13;
*  Recommend a phased remedial plan with clearly defined priorities.&#13;
*  Prepare cost estimates and implementation timetables.&#13;
Outline Terms of Reference for Community Based Hazard Reduction:&#13;
Integrated Mitigation, Warning and Response&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
59.    To a great extent, the GOAP has assumed the responsibility of replacing the assets and&#13;
resources lost to the disasters which frequently affect the state, thereby facing a continuous drain of&#13;
public funds. Vulnerable populations have come to rely heavily on the state government for the&#13;
satisfaction of their post-disaster needs. As the levels of dependency on government emergency&#13;
and relief assistance have increased, incentives for sharing the responsibility for disaster&#13;
preparedness and management have diminished significantly among local communities in the&#13;
cyclone and flood prone areas. Given current fiscal constraints, however, official programs such&#13;
as emergency shelters cannot continue to depend completely on government resources for their&#13;
AP Hazard Mitigation and Emergency Cyclone Recovery Project&#13;
Attachment 15: Outline TOR for Consultancies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
maintenance and/or management. As part of a sound strategy for community development,&#13;
vulnerable populations should be involved in hazard reduction activities at the local level.&#13;
OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY&#13;
60.   The long-term objectives of the study are to (i) reduce the financial and psychological&#13;
impact of disasters on the affected populations and the GOAP; and (ii) increase the levels of&#13;
disaster preparedness among vulnerable populations and industries.&#13;
61.   The short-term objectives of the study, considering the project implementation period and&#13;
the overall hazard activities to be undertaken by the GOAP under the project, are to address&#13;
shortfalls and reconunend programs and activities that would improve (i) the accuracy of warnings;&#13;
(ii) warning effectiveness at the taluka and mandal level, including a degree of warning redundancy&#13;
necessary to ensure reliable warnings and an adequate response level among the target audience;&#13;
(iii) individual and community involvement in disaster preparedness and mitigation; (iv)&#13;
effectiveness of warning response mechanisms at all levels, including district, taluka, mandal,&#13;
community and individual; and, (v) communications systems at the taluka and mandal level,&#13;
particularly computer-based systems with Internet links and the capacity to access relevant data on&#13;
warning and mitigation issues as well as related community development information.&#13;
62.   These objectives will be accomplished in two phases:&#13;
(a) Phase 1 - Assessment. It will consist of a thorovtgh analysis of (i) state and local&#13;
capacity at various levels and different respects, including, inter alia, individual,&#13;
community, institutional and technical capacity, and (ii) the needs of vulnerable&#13;
populations.&#13;
(b)  Phase 2 - Design and Implementation. Drawing from the information and&#13;
recommendations gathered during Phase I, it will entail the design and undertaking&#13;
of hazard reduction programs through locally-focused activities supported with local&#13;
financing and in-kind contributions, along with GOAP and international funds.&#13;
Specific Phase II activities are only suggested in this TOR as an indication of what&#13;
can be done, since a precise and elaborated plan will be the responsibility of the&#13;
consultants. The latter should provide the final list and content of activities.&#13;
63.   The programs addressing the above objectives should be based on a two-way dialogue&#13;
between the government and the target populations in vulnerable areas. Issues to cover should&#13;
include local needs, capacities and appropriate disaster preparedness and response mechanisms.&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
64.    Overall study outcome Once completed, the study will lead to the following general&#13;
results:&#13;
(a)  a link with the other sub-components and studies included in the project, to ensure&#13;
the overall compatibility and integration of data, paradigms and planning&#13;
recommendations being produced, such as data and findings on flood modeling,&#13;
hazard mapping, demographics, et cetera.&#13;
(b)  improved forecast precision and reduced time-lag between IMD's landfall prediction&#13;
and community/individual emergency response.&#13;
AP Hazard Mitigation and Emergency Cyclone Recovery Project&#13;
Attachment 15: Outline TOR for Consultancies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
(c)  reduced negative impact of disasters on financial resources of GOAP and affected&#13;
populations.&#13;
65.    All studies and assessments shall be made in conjunction with the other studies called for&#13;
in the Project with full utilization of the data and findings in these studies as they become available.&#13;
It is expected that the consultants will form a close working relationship with DMU, which will&#13;
provide free and easy access/exchange of data between the various studies included in the Project.&#13;
66.   All activities in the project should be coordinated and worked through and in conjunction&#13;
with the activities being developed in the Janmabhoomi Program. The latter should be used as&#13;
support for the many community hazard reduction activities to be implemented under these TOR.&#13;
67.   The study will be implemented in two phases: Phase 1, which will identify the needs and&#13;
strategies for addressing these needs, and in which implementation in high priority projects will&#13;
begin where appropriate. All activities listed below will take place during this phase, unless&#13;
specifically designated "phase 2" (in which the studies, designs and recommendations of the first&#13;
phase are acted on through program implementation as appropriate). Phase 1 and phase 2 are&#13;
further addressed below.&#13;
PROJECT TASKS AND PRODUCTS&#13;
68.   The following are the major tasks to be undertaken by the consultants in cooperation with&#13;
the GOAP, to achieve the immediate objectives of the study. It is, however, left to the professional&#13;
judgment of the consultants to make any necessary supplements in order to achieve the immediate&#13;
objective of the study leading to the long-term project objectives. In this respect, the consultants&#13;
will make recommendations and design activities that promote the development of one or more of&#13;
three disaster management products: (i) a comprehensive vulnerability assessment; (ii) operational&#13;
disaster response; and, (iii) a state-wide disaster mitigation strategy.&#13;
69.   The improvement of lines of communication between IMD forecasting and individuals in&#13;
villages and towns on the AP coast which builds on the improvement in IMD forecasting is an&#13;
expected outcome from the acquisition of radar and other equipment by the IMD.&#13;
70.    The consultants shall assess the suitability and identify problems of current process of&#13;
disseminating warnings from the time a forecast is made by the IMD to the receipt of this warning&#13;
by the vulnerable populations. Recommendations for additional equipment shall be made if found&#13;
appropriate. Alternative means of communicating the warnings will be examined and at least one&#13;
redundant mechanism will be recommended. Output: Recommendations for improvements in&#13;
existing transmission of waming and additional mechanisms identified to provide redundancy.&#13;
EFFECTIVENESS OF WARNING&#13;
71.    The consultants shall assess the warning system for effectiveness. Constraints to an&#13;
effective warning which elicits a reasonable and protective response will be identified, and&#13;
recommendations made, if appropriate, which could remove these constraints. The consultants&#13;
shall examine particularly the constraints imposed by "waming fatigue" and recommend&#13;
mechanisms and programs which address this phenomenon As part of this assessment, the&#13;
consultants shall also examine elements of the composition of the present warning messages, with&#13;
consideration to technical and anthropological issues which affect warning effectiveness and&#13;
identify areas where warnings can be made more effective and pervasive, i.e. improvement of Air&#13;
India Radio (AIR) effectiveness for waming.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
72.   Phase 2. The consultants shall design and assist in the implementation of appropriate&#13;
programs which improve warning effectiveness. Outcomes: Recommendations and proposals&#13;
which will result in a more effective warning, and better responses to warnings. Implementation of&#13;
programs which address constraints to an effective warning system.&#13;
ALTERNATIVE WARNING MECHANISMS&#13;
73.   The consultants shall identify, where appropriate, alternative low-cost warning&#13;
mechanisms, and local informal warning mechanisms which could augment the existing technical&#13;
systems. Among the mechanisms which the consultants should examine are GIS fishing boat&#13;
locators, and the utilization of an enhancement of folk warning systems. Outcome: Proposals for&#13;
augmenting present systems with alternative and informal warning mechanisms.&#13;
COMMUNITY VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS&#13;
74.   In conjunction with the participation of people in vulnerable coastal and nrverine&#13;
communities, the consultants shall conduct participatory vulnerability assessments in 15 per cent of&#13;
villages in the high hazard areas of Andhra Pradesh. The consultants shall help these communities&#13;
identify priorities for immediate, medium and long term interventions for hazard reduction and&#13;
identify ways in which they can address these needs.&#13;
75.   The consultants shall also identify local lead institutions capable of implementing&#13;
community hazard awareness programs and providing leadership for preparedness. These&#13;
institutions could be, inter alia, fishing cooperatives, marketing networks and organizations and&#13;
maritime authorities.&#13;
76.   It is envisioned that pilot activities begun in these communities will provide the basis for&#13;
similar and improved projects in all villages in vulnerable zones.&#13;
77.   Phase 2. The consultants shall assist communities in high hazard areas in designing and&#13;
implementing mitigation programs. It is envisioned that these programs would have a significant&#13;
contribution by the community, but would also receive matching financial assistance from the&#13;
Vulnerability Reduction Fund and/or the GOAP. Outcome: Recommendations for and&#13;
implementation of (in phase 2) activities for community designed and administered hazard&#13;
reduction.&#13;
COMMUNITY AWARENESS AND PREPAREDNESS&#13;
78.   The consultants shall identify ways to increase awareness and preparation for cyclone and&#13;
floods in vulnerable communities but not limited to: (i) provision of incentives for community and&#13;
individual preparedness; (ii) education on effective responses, evacuation procedures, and for&#13;
municipal government's public awareness campaigns as appropriate, and (iii) education on safety&#13;
during disasters. Output: Proposals for increasing hazard awareness and preparation for floods&#13;
and cyclones.&#13;
EFFECTIVENESS OF CYCLONE AND FLOOD RESPONSE&#13;
79.   The consultants shall perform an assessment of existing district taluka and mandal level&#13;
response mechanisms including, but not be limited to, an assessment of systems and equipment.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
80.   The consultants shall examine the constraints on response to cyclone and floods by&#13;
individuals in high hazard areas, and propose programs which will assist individuals in responding&#13;
more effectively to cyclones and floods. Output: Proposals for improving institutional and&#13;
individual responses to cyclone and flood warnings.&#13;
SHELTER IMPROVEMENT&#13;
81.    Community Emergency Shelters. The consultants shall examine the shelters available to&#13;
the populations of high hazard areas and assess the shelters suitability and capacity to safely house&#13;
local populations which might be expected to use the shelter. In conjunction with the community,&#13;
the consultants shall identify appropriate uses of the shelter when not required for shelter from&#13;
flood or disaster, help the community to identify needs and mechanisms which will improve the off-&#13;
disaster use and maintenance of the shelter, identify sheltering and relief needs during times of&#13;
flood and cyclone, and develop plans and design programs to address these needs. The consultants&#13;
shall help communities in high risk areas to identify buildings in the community to provide&#13;
sufficient shelter for the population, and work with the GOAP to provide additional emergency&#13;
shelter infrastructure if required.&#13;
FAMILY HOUSING - SHELTER&#13;
82.   The consultants shall examine existing programs for housing improvement in vulnerable&#13;
areas and make recommendations for integration of hazard mitigation elements into these&#13;
programs. The consultants shall examine the economic trade-of of investing in housing upgrade&#13;
versus participating in a hazard fund or insurance for post-disaster housing replacement or&#13;
rehabilitation. Where appropriate, the consultants will recommend additional initiatives which will&#13;
promote the strengthening of existing housing and building of new housing to standards of&#13;
construction which will improve the resistance of the housing to wind and inundation. Such&#13;
programs should address, inter alia, placement of openings in houses, roof design and roof/frame&#13;
connections, house siting, bracing and other simple and easily implemented engineering techniques&#13;
and use of water resistant materials.&#13;
83.    Recommendations for family housing improvement will be made within the economic&#13;
context of vulnerable families. All recommendations must be able to be implemented by families&#13;
with few monetary resources. Addressing this issue, the consultants recommendations will&#13;
consider, inter alia, the use of inexpensive locally available materials, incentive schemes for&#13;
housing improvement such as combining material and upgrading requirements with programs for&#13;
subsidized improved building materials and training for unskilled and indigent families in better&#13;
techniques for self-constructed cyclone and flood resistant housing.&#13;
84.   All proposals for housing improvement shall include plans for independent monitoring of&#13;
the programs to insure that funds are used efficiently in improving poorly constructed housing&#13;
among the most vulnerable populations.&#13;
85.   Phase 2. The consultants shall assist the state and community in implementing programs&#13;
designed under phase 1. Outputs: Sufficient community shelter for all vulnerable populations;&#13;
shelter maintenance programs in place; and improved resistance to wind and water in family&#13;
housing.&#13;

DISASTER PREPAREDNESS&#13;
86.   The consultants shall identify and suggest design for activities which will assist&#13;
communities and institutions in high hazard occupations to prepare for flood, cyclones and for the&#13;
inevitable losses from disaster. The designs should assure that they will be sustained long term by&#13;
the organizations or institutions which they serve, with a minimum of assistance for the GOAP or&#13;
other donors. The areas to be examined should include: mutual assistance programs (fisherman&#13;
coops, agricultural co-opts and other local trade organizations, economic improvement via&#13;
preparedness, such as subsidized insurance programs, marine safety programs and involvement of&#13;
local business groups (i.e. Lion's clubs) in the development of prograns for mutual assistance&#13;
and/or disaster insurance.&#13;
87.   Phase 2. As directed by the Disaster Management Unit, the consultants shall assist trade&#13;
organizations and other institutions in implementing preparedness programs. Output: Proposals&#13;
for self-standing preparedness programs and institutions which prepare vulnerable groups to&#13;
mitigate losses due to disasters.&#13;
COMMUNITY ACCESS TO INFORMATION - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS&#13;
88.    The Consultants shall assist in the development of a community based Internet access&#13;
system. The project will provide, under a separate component, the necessary equipment to allow&#13;
local (village level) leaders, organizations and institutions access to a variety of information over&#13;
the Internet, especially information which can assist local leadership in developing disaster&#13;
mitigation and preparedness programs. The system will primarily allow a more direct contact&#13;
between the state government and activities at the village level.&#13;
89.   In the context of their other activities at the community level and in conjunction with local&#13;
leadership, the consultants shall design a program for use of a local Internet access system which&#13;
will give maximum access to information from the Internet to a broad spectrum of local leaders and&#13;
organizations. The programs' design shall anticipate impediments to a free and broad access and&#13;
will recommend mechanisms to insure that such impediments are minimized. These&#13;
recommendations shall be developed through dialog with the District Disaster Management&#13;
Committees, the Disaster Management Unit (DMU) and the Disaster Management Council.&#13;
Acting on the comments of these groups, the consultants will, afterwards, refine recommendations&#13;
for the organization of the system for approval.&#13;
90.    The consultants shall provide the necessary oversight to begin real-time operation of the&#13;
system and troubleshoot initial problems in the system for six months after start up of the system.&#13;
Outputs: Proposal for village level accessible communication links. Installation of the village&#13;
level system and training for management staff.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION OF HAZARD MITIGATION, WARNING IMPROVEMENT AND&#13;
PREPAREDNESS PROJECTS&#13;
91.    The consultant shall provide general technical oversight for implementation of all&#13;
programs, report on a regular basis to the DMU on progress of the implementation and assess the&#13;
implementation of the programs in the context of the overall and immediate objectives of the&#13;
project outlined above.&#13;
92.   As directed by DMU, the consultant shall take an active role in assisting communities,&#13;
organization, mandal leadership and other organizations and groups as appropriate in implementing&#13;
prograrns designed under this project.&#13;

ECONOMICANALYSIS                       7777 &#13;
1. The econonic rationale for cyclone emergency planning and mitigation is based on the premise&#13;
that the better the recuperative capacity of an economy - that is the economy's disaster planning&#13;
measures to minimize damage and the implementation of post-cyclone recovery operations - the&#13;
lower the immediate and long-term damage inflicted on the economy. The degree of local&#13;
recuperative capacity to be built is influenced by the vulnerability specific to the region in question.&#13;
2. Vulnerability to natural disasters of a particular region depends both on the frequency and&#13;
magnitude of these disasters, and on the economic and social profile of the exposed region. Even&#13;
though a hurricane may be severe, if it occurs in a unpopulated region with little economic activity,&#13;
the impact may be insignificant. Similarly, if an economically developed and densely populated&#13;
region is subject to earthquakes having occurred as frequent as once in a century, the low&#13;
probability of the incident may not justify investments beyond emergency relief and response. It is&#13;
the coexistence of the two aspects of vulnerability - physical and socio-economical - that would&#13;
call for mitigation measures.&#13;
3. From an economic perspective, investments into local recuperative capacity are deemed to be&#13;
beneficial provided that the present value of the averted losses through mitigation measures&#13;
outweigh the present value of the cost of mitigation over a specified time period. The costs of&#13;
mitigation are defined as the investment costs incurred for the mitigation measures plus the annual&#13;
cost of maintenance. Averted losses include the direct and indirect damage - that is the costs to&#13;
replace lost or damaged assets and inventories (direct), and induced hardship on population and&#13;
long-term impacts on macroeconomic variables (indirect), respectively - that could be prevented&#13;
through investment into mitigation. The extent of damage avoided depends on both the physical and&#13;
socio-economic vulnerability.&#13;
4. Physical Vulnerability. Between 1891 and 1969, about 450 cyclones of various degrees of&#13;
intensity - which tended to increase over the years as evidenced by wind velocities - occurred in&#13;
the Bay of Bengal, generating damage in the coastal districts of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh,&#13;
Orissa, West Bengal and Bangladesh. One or two cyclone storms hit or skirt the 1030 kilometers&#13;
long coast of Andhra Pradesh annually. As presented in table 1 below, the coastal districts of&#13;
Andhra Pradesh were subjected to 60 cyclone storms during this century, 25 of which were severe&#13;
in terms of impact.&#13;
5. In addition to the frequency of occurrence, there is a combination of factors that render the&#13;
coast of Andhra Pradesh physically vulnerable to cyclones and related storm surges. The low-lying&#13;
lands, typical for the Eastern shore of India, permit storm surges, even of a few meters height, to&#13;
inundate far into the hinterland, causing widespread flooding and sea water incursion not only in&#13;
the coastal region. This natural calamity is exacerbated by man-made physical vulnerability as for&#13;
instance the disappearance of mangrove forests due to commercial shrimp farming along the coast.&#13;
In places with significant gaps in tree shelter, tidal waves have reached into the hinterland further&#13;
than in places with protective vegetation. Moreover, the low permeability of the soils in the Krishna&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
delta combined with poor maintenance of the drainage, that would - if not clogged - ensure the sea&#13;
water to flow back to the sea, tend to increase the period and area of submersion.&#13;

6. Social and Economic Vulnerability. With over 66 million inhabitants, Andhra Pradesh is the&#13;
fourth most populous state in India. Much of its population is located in the more prosperous and&#13;
fertile districts along the coast, where population densities are in many districts more than twice the&#13;
state's average. As presented in table 2 below, human lives lost from severe cyclones during the&#13;
past two decades amount to almost 17,000, with almost 100 million people having been affected&#13;
either through permanent relocation, temporary loss of shelter or other adversities from cyclones.&#13;

daml.: '5 g"ihave been discounted with an annual rate of ten percent over a twenty year period, under&#13;
.t. ;i:umptions that two percent, five percent, ten percent, fifteen percent or twenty percent,&#13;

Snm.11"in. Upact as the recent one would only occur once in a century (probability = 0.01), to the&#13;
assi  ,boni) that there is a likelihood of the incidence of a cyclone of 30 percent each year&#13;
= lit   0.30).&#13;
10. Y e v,,pected present value of benefits for the proposed investment into mitigation can hence&#13;
be c   : efd as the sum of the discounted averted costs weighted by the probability of occurrence.&#13;

The costs of mitigation for current proposed project have been defined as the sum of thirty pi- m.rrc rll&#13;
of the cost of infrastructure restoration and hundred percent of the cost of mitigation (see&#13;
attachment 1). Annual costs of ten percent have been assumed for maintenance, discounted ov,.. the&#13;
period of twenty years and added to the initial investnent costs. The present value of the mitii .oj&#13;
cost would then amount to US$200 million.&#13;
11. The area shaded in table 3 below, represent the scenarios where the net benefits are negat&gt; .&#13;
over the twenty year period observed. When the probability of a cyclone is assumed to be ten&#13;
percent (p=O. 10), the net benefits start become positive when fifteen percent of damage is assninr;(;1&#13;
to be prevented by the investmnent. Both assumption are fairly conservative, given that three&#13;
cyclones with a comparable damage record have hit the coast of Andhra Pradesh during the last&#13;
twenty years, and twenty-five severe cyclones (p=0.25) have affected the coastal districts durinw.&#13;
this century. In addition, the percentage of damage prevented in the presence of minor and med. nm&#13;
intense cyclones is likely to exceed the twenty percent margin assumed at the top end of these&#13;
projections.&#13;

13. Taking for instance figure 3 above, one can see as indicated by the vertical lines that, under the&#13;
probability that ten cyclones would hit the coastal region of Andha Pradesh (p=O. 10), net benefits&#13;
would be materialized in the twenty percent damage avoidance scenario already within five years&#13;
and in the fifteen percent damage avoidance scenario within eight-and-a-half years. With the&#13;
averted cost curve being steeper than then investment cost curve, one can also see from figure 3,&#13;
that net benefits would be realized if a longer time period would be considered. In figure 4 and 5,&#13;
net benefits would be materialized in the twenty, fifteen and ten percent scenarios, but not in the&#13;
case of only two percent of damage being avoided by the mitigation measures.&#13;

14. The consideration of alternative type of investments into mitigation have been omitted from&#13;
this analysis, mainly because the project in consideration is an emergency lending operation that&#13;
requires speedy and immediate implementation, but also because international experience on&#13;
hazard prevention and mitigation was included in the project design. Accordingly, the question that&#13;
sought to be answered in this analysis is rather if investment into cyclone hazard mitigation would&#13;
pay-off in the short and long-run.&#13;
15. The assessed damage on which this analysis is based does not include intangible costs like loss&#13;
of life, or indirect costs as loss of employment or long-run macroeconomic impacts. The two billion&#13;
US Dollars reflect only the direct damage to infrastructure, agriculture, industry and housing&#13;
(replacement cost). Despite having omitted these additional costs and given the very conservative&#13;

AP HAZARD MITIGATION AND EMERGENCY CYCLONE RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS&#13;
Outline of the Procedures for Environmental Screening and Assessment&#13;
1.    The GOAP will ensure that sub-project implementing agencies observe systematic&#13;
procedures for environmental analysis during project planing and implementation. The Disaster&#13;
Management Unit (DMU) will be responsible for providing environmental clearances for each sub-&#13;
project supported under the project. Detailed evaluation criteria, recommended checklists,&#13;
questionnaires, and other analytical approaches will be developed jointly between the DMU and&#13;
other concerned line departments such as Environment and Forests, Irrigation, Roads and&#13;
Buildings, Panchayati Raj, State Electricity Board, Environmental Protection Research and&#13;
Training Institute (EPRTI) and the Shore Area Development Authority (SADA).&#13;
INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL BRIEF&#13;
2.     Prior to initiation of any disbursement under this project, the concerned implementing&#13;
agency will prepare an initial environmental brief for submission to the DMU as part of the overall&#13;
sub-project proposal. The purpose of the environmental brief is to provide sufficient information to&#13;
the DMU to determine if a project sub-component can proceed or if more detailed environmental&#13;
impact assessment (ETA) is required before the proposal can be approved.&#13;
3.     The format of the brief should be simple yet comprehensive. It should describe all aspects&#13;
of the project proposal and the environmental benefits and adverse impacts which may be&#13;
associated with the proposal. Due to the wide range of possible sub-projects, the format should be&#13;
flexible. However, the format of the brief should contain certain basic information. At a minimum,&#13;
the following elements should be included in the environmental brief:&#13;
4.     Sub-Project description. This section should describe the details of the proposed sub-&#13;
project(s). It should provide information on the background to the sub-project (i.e., nature and&#13;
extent of damages), proposed activities to be funded, and the basic justification and rationale for&#13;
the proposal.&#13;
5.    Description of environmental concerns. A brief description of likely environmental&#13;
irnpacts associated with the proposed activities should be prepared The description could be in the&#13;
form of a checklist, impact matrix or other suitable presentation format. The environmental&#13;
analysis should address several types of impacts and, where appropriate, should include description&#13;
of environmental benefits as well as adverse aspects of the proposal. Potential impacts should be&#13;
described under major headings such as (a) land use modification; (b) disturbance to aquatic or&#13;
terrestrial habitats; (c) proximity to protected areas, designated zones, or areas of concern (e.g.,&#13;
wetland area); (d) air and water pollution; (e) public health; and (f) land acquisition or resettlement&#13;
requirements.&#13;
6.     The environmental brief should include an appropriate scale reference map(s) clearly&#13;
illustrating the location specific context of the project. The map should illustrate significant&#13;
terrestrial and aquatic habitats, protected areas, land use, cultural heritage sites or other location&#13;
specific information which may be needed to evaluate the possible impacts of the proposal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
7.    Description of environmental mitigation. To the extent possible, the environmental brief&#13;
should also describe any mitigation activities or alternative approaches which could be undertaken&#13;
to offset environmental damages. The section would describe responsibility for implementing any&#13;
mitigation plan and should indicate budget and staff needs where appropriate..&#13;
INTER DEPARTMENTAL CONSULTATIONS.&#13;
8.    Prior to submission of the environmental brief to the DMU, the implementing agency will&#13;
carry out inter-departmental consultations with relevant GOAP and GOI agencies that would have&#13;
an interest in or be impacted by, the proposed sub-project. Following these consultations, the&#13;
implementing agency will submit the package to the DMU for final review and clearance.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND CLEARANCE&#13;
9.     Each completed sub-project proposal will be reviewed by the environmental specialist of&#13;
the DMU. Based on this review, the DMU will determine whether the project can proceed as&#13;
described or whether a more detailed environmental impact assessment (EIA) will be required.. If&#13;
an EIA is required, the DMU will prepare a detailed terms of reference for this assessment. The&#13;
implementing agency will then be required to complete the EIA as defined by the DMU. The ETA&#13;
will be subsequently reviewed by the DMU upon its completion. The DMU will rely on the use of&#13;
consultants or other independent experts, such as SADA or EPRTI, to review projects with&#13;
significant environmental impacts.&#13;
10.    The DMU will, in addition, prepare detailed guidelines and criteria to assist in the review&#13;
of sub-project proposals. Where sub-projects are determined to have significant environmental&#13;
impacts requiring further EIA, an appropriate process for public review and consultation will be&#13;
inplemented. The DMU will institute a systematic process for monitoring sub-projects where&#13;
environmental issues are considered significant. The details of the monitoring plan will be project&#13;
specific and developed as part of the EIA process.&#13;

PUBLIC BUILDINGS&#13;
OBJECTIVE&#13;
1.    The primary objective is to repair and strengthen public buildings that house critical&#13;
infrastructure and/or fulfill essential public service functions, in order to (i) enable the continued&#13;
functioning of critical services during and after a disaster, and (ii) enable them to serve effectively&#13;
as shelters during emergencies.&#13;
STRATEGY&#13;
2.    The strategy proposed consists of: (i) identification of critical public buildings based on the&#13;
district vulnerability reduction plan, along with the identification of settlements lacking cyclone and&#13;
storm surge resistant buildings; (ii) identification and rehabilitation of buildings that can be&#13;
upgraded at limited additional cost; and (iii) identification and repair of buildings that have&#13;
suffered extensive damages. The R&amp;B Department and the Panchayati Raj Department will&#13;
undertake the implementation of the necessary works. Responsibility for maintenance will fall to&#13;
the respective department, in collaboration with the local community through community schemes&#13;
such as the Janmabhoomi program.&#13;
3.    The prioritization of investments is based on (i) location: emphasis is to be given to&#13;
buildings located in high risk areas which have few other pucca buildings that can serve as shelters&#13;
during an emergency; (ii) function: focus will be on buildings housing critical functions, such as&#13;
hospitals, power generation units, etc.; and (iii) extent of damage: focus will be on buildings that&#13;
were badly damaged and whose present state may pose a threat to its users. Restoration of school&#13;
buildings was given a high priority since they are not only centers for learning, but are often the&#13;
only permanent public facility in a settlement and a wide range of social and developmental&#13;
activities tend to revolve around them. Speedy restoration of damaged schools will help in&#13;
restoring the normal functioning of these activities.&#13;
PROPOSALS&#13;
4.    The estimated cost of the proposed restoration of damaged buildings maintained by the&#13;
R&amp;B Department totals Rs 101 million (see Table 1 below). The estimated cost of the proposed&#13;
restoration of damaged buildings maintained by the Panchayati Raj Department is also presented in&#13;

            The Andhra Pradesh Hazard Mitigation and
            Emergency Cyclone Recovery Project's objectives are (1)
            to help the state government prepare and implement a hazard
            management program in high risk areas, and restore public
            infrastructure lost last year, according to the
            hazard-resistant criteria for infrastructure sites,
            construction, and quality control; and (2) to enhance
            India's cyclone early warning capacity. The project
            will finance (1) a hazard management program promoting
            selected prevention, mitigation, and preparedness activities
            for water-related disasters; (2) the restoration of damaged
            public infrastructure, including irrigation drains and
            flood-banks, roads and bridges, public buildings, and
            mitigation works; and (3) technical assistance for project
            implementation and management, and financing for incremental
            operating costs on a declining scale.
