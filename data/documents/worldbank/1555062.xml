OWNERSHIP AND EFFICIENCY IN URBAN BUSES&#13;
Efficiency in urban bus operation depends on, among other things,&#13;
the institutional form of the bus business. For certain cities in LDCs&#13;
where there are parallel private and publicly owned operations, it is&#13;
demonstrated that the costs of private provision are between 50 percent to&#13;
60 percent of those of publicly owned concerns. Additional evidence is&#13;
adduced to show that the quality of private bus services is not markedly&#13;
inferior and usually superior to the public bus operation.&#13;

OWNERSHIP AND EFFICIENCY IN URBAN BUSES&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
One of the characteristic features of urban bus services is creeping,&#13;
if not galloping, municipalization or nationalization. The rationalizations&#13;
for public ownership vary in detail but all have a common theme: the need to&#13;
integrate and coordinate services and avoid the wastes of competition. This&#13;
objective does not require public ownership; suitably regulated private bus&#13;
companies could perform in a similar way to those of a nationalized concern.&#13;
But public ownership is thought to make it easier to implement plans for&#13;
coordination--and in particular to insure that certain unprofitable but&#13;
"socially necessary" services are provided.  Claims that nationalization&#13;
would reduce costs are the corollary of the elimination of alleged wasteful&#13;
competition. Route "rationalization" and the introduction of efficient large&#13;
fleet maintenance procedures are meant to produce significant reductions in&#13;
cost for the publicly owned concern.&#13;
So far as we are aware, there have been no scholarly evaluations of&#13;
the extent to which nationalization has achieved the aims of integration,&#13;
coordination and rationalization. This may well be because the concepts are&#13;
difficult to define in any meaningful sense. With costs it is another matter.&#13;
It is incumbent on analysts of public transport to investigate the costs of&#13;
transport and how such costs vary with respect to the institutional form.&#13;
The main purpose of this paper is to compare the costs of services of pri-&#13;
vately owned buses with costs of the nationalized cmpanies. The associated&#13;
issue, the range of size of firm over which there are economies or disecon-&#13;
omies of scale, is not tackled. If there are economies of scale, above the&#13;
300 to 400 bus concern, then these should operate in favor of the nationalized&#13;
corporation--and if there are diseconomies, then the contention of the&#13;
"nationalizers" or "integrators" is discredited. Nor do we attempt rigorously&#13;
to identify the sources of the differences in cost of the public and private&#13;
sectors--although some general explanation of the differences observed in,&#13;
for example, wage costs are tentatively suggested.&#13;
One main drawback of this study is the limitation of the sample.&#13;
We have examined the data of three cities in LDCs and more casually two in&#13;
developed countries where there are similar bus operations in the private&#13;
and public sectors. The cities tended to choose themselves since there are&#13;
few examples where public buses and substantial numbers of private buses&#13;
operate under similar conditions with similar routes and in the same factor&#13;
markets. This selectivity is important because it might be suggested that&#13;
the existence of a large number of privately owned buses testifies to the&#13;
failure of nationalization. 1/ Thus it may be alleged that we have selected&#13;
1/   The opposite charge that the private sector has ruined the nationalized&#13;
corporation cannot be substantiated in our cities. The nationalized&#13;
corporation had the authority to grow; what it lacked were financial,&#13;
operational, and administrative means. The private sector has been&#13;
tolerated, not encouraged, because of the failure of the public sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
only hopeless situations. We shall bring evidence to suggest that this is not&#13;
the case; but the issue can be satisfactorily settled only by the accumulation&#13;
of more evidence than we are able to present here.&#13;
II. DATA ON COSTS&#13;
Evidence on relative costs comes in two basic forms. First, there&#13;
are the results of cost investigations or inquiries by experts. In some cases&#13;
this takes the form of examining accounts, but in most cases the records are&#13;
insufficiently illuminating and the experts usually substitute vigorous&#13;
inquiries directed at operators and direct observation reinforced by their&#13;
experience and general knowledge. What emerges is a comparison of unit costs.&#13;
The second form is to infer the relative costs from one usually well-known&#13;
fact: the amount of money needed to cover the deficit of the municipalized&#13;
or nationalized bus company, and from one axiom, namely, that if private&#13;
operators persist in offering their services, they will be making at least&#13;
normal profits. For example, suppose there is a publicly owned bus company&#13;
which covers half its cost by a subsidy and that in the same city private&#13;
operators run virtually identical services at the same fare, then provision-&#13;
ally it may be concluded that the costs of the public operation are twice&#13;
those of the private operator.&#13;
Of the two forms of evidence, the latter is preferred. The subsidy&#13;
is normally a matter of public record and is open for all to see. Similarly,&#13;
the level of fares is not a difficult matter to observe and cannot easily be&#13;
obfuscated. Conditions of the service are also issues upon which the outsider&#13;
can make judgments. On the other hand, the cost evidence is more subjective&#13;
and open to varied interpretations. Many investigators have substantial expe-&#13;
rience only in the public sector and they quite naturally are apt to apply&#13;
the standards which they think are appropriate, especially with respect to&#13;
maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and perhaps also labor costs. It&#13;
is not unusual to find that such experts suggest that the private operators&#13;
cannot conceivably be covering their true costs and that they are incipient&#13;
bankrupts busily eating their seed corn. 1/ It is also troublesome to have&#13;
to estimate what are "normal profits" as a constituent of cost.&#13;
1/   The classic statement of this position with respect to the trucker but&#13;
equally applicable to bus operators, repeated many times in the litera-&#13;
ture, is the Salter Report of 1933.&#13;
"(the trucker) is able to purchase his vehicle on the&#13;
installment system and is often tempted to force his way&#13;
in by offering rates which are completely unremunerative&#13;
and which necessarily lead to bankruptcy which, nevertheless,&#13;
does not discourage others--or perhaps even himself--from&#13;
following the same course in perpetual succession....."&#13;
This strange description was found to be quite inconsistent with the&#13;
facts--indeed unregulated truckers had lower bankruptcy rates than&#13;
virtually all other industries in the period 1920-1933. See W. McLeod&#13;
and A.A. Walters "A Note on Bankruptcy Rates in Road Haulage Industry,"&#13;
Journal of Industrial Economics, 1956.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Another generic problem with these comparisons is that the extent&#13;
of regulation, both overt and covert, and political direction varies consid-&#13;
erably and sometimes to an extent unknown. Private operators, although they&#13;
may be ostensibly legally free to pursue their own policies, often have the&#13;
threat of nationalization held over their heads in order to get them to con-&#13;
form to what is thought to be in the interests of the political regime then&#13;
in power. We have tried to elicit the nature and extent of this political&#13;
or bureaucratic control, but there is no doubt much that we have not&#13;
uncovered. 1/&#13;
A. Subsidies and Fares&#13;
Comparison of costs of a publicly owned bus company and those of&#13;
private concerns can be useful only when the two are operating in virtually&#13;
the same environment under the same conditions. Calcutta, Istanbul and&#13;
Bangkok were three LDC cities in which we could identify such parallel&#13;
public companies and private operators. Each city has a publicly owned bus&#13;
company operating parallel with privately owned buses. One is naturally&#13;
cautious about drawing conclusions from a self-selecting sample of this kind.&#13;
Is it not true, for example, that the very fact that private operators are&#13;
tolerated attests to the failure of these public companies? In other cities&#13;
it may be suggested that public competition has been a "success" and we have&#13;
simply picked out the basket cases. Perhaps so, but there is much circum-&#13;
stantial evidence against this argument. In many low-income countries public&#13;
bus companies have large and increasing deficits. 2/ Furthermore, a study&#13;
of OECD countries in 1975 showed that subsidies were ubiquitous ranging from&#13;
11% to 70% of operating cost (i.e., excluding large capital costs) with an&#13;
average of 37%. 3/&#13;
In Calcutta, Istanbul, and Bangkok the public bus companies cover&#13;
about 60%, 37%, and 72% of their total costs with their revenue. For the&#13;
three cities we have the following data on deficits (excluding interest on&#13;
accrued deficits):&#13;
1/   In an earlier study, Lim (1978) looked at the effect of ownership&#13;
(public or private), competition (strong or weak direct competition&#13;
between buses and other modes), and fleet size on cost efficiency for&#13;
nine Asian cities. Only the form of ownership had anywhere near a&#13;
statistically significant effect on cost. A test of the average cost&#13;
per bus seat mile, adjusted to reflect relative prices and cost of&#13;
living, showed private bus costs to be lower than public bus costs.&#13;
Lim's results are contrary to conventional wisdom.&#13;
2/   Idem.  Besides Bangkok, Calcutta and Istanbul, these include Bombay,&#13;
Madras, Jakarta, Manila, Karachi and Cairo.&#13;
3/   OECD (1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Deficit ($)     Total Revenue/Total Cost (%)&#13;
Calcutta         1976       8 million                   0.60&#13;
Istanbul         1977      35 million                  0.37&#13;
Bangkok /a       1978      17.6 million                 0.72&#13;
/a   Part of the interest on accrued deficit could not be&#13;
eliminated from the costs.&#13;
Calcutta deficits began in 1962/63 and have increased every year (doubling&#13;
between 1972 and 1977). Istanbul's deficit has increased fourfold since 1973,&#13;
the first year for which data are available. In Bangkok the public operator&#13;
has had a deficit since 1976 when the nationalized company was formed and the&#13;
deficit is expected to increase substantially.&#13;
But in each of these three cities private operators also ply, with&#13;
the same fare, carrying a substantial proportion of bus ridership (75% in&#13;
Calcutta and 60% in Istanbul, and an uncertain 40-50% in Bangkok) and they&#13;
earn a profit at least sufficient to induce them to stay in business. They&#13;
also pay taxes. The most rapid growth in private operators' share of the&#13;
total bus fleet and ridership in Calcutta and Istanbul has occurred after&#13;
some years of public ownership. These data do not discredit the tentative&#13;
hypothesis that private operators provide similar bus services at lower cost.&#13;
The differences can be impressive. In Istanbul, with the same fares, a&#13;
minibus owner makes about LT 20,000 (US$1,100) profit per year per bus and&#13;
the public operator loses LT 1.15 million (US$64,000) per year per effective&#13;
bus (see Annex 3). 1/&#13;
The use of these data on subsidies to adduce the relative costs of&#13;
private and public bus operations involves the assumption that the private&#13;
operators are making only normal profits. Since there is, in all cities,&#13;
a persistent pressure on the authorities (or others) by incipient private&#13;
operators for licenses (or other "authorization") to run a bus, one may&#13;
suspect that profits were probably above normal. Thus the ratio of revenue&#13;
to cost in the publicly owned enterprise is an underestimate of the ratio of&#13;
the costs of the private firms to the costs of the publicly owned concern.&#13;
We conclude therefore that the ratio of private costs to public costs is&#13;
likely to be lower than the range 0.37 to 0.72 observed in the sample cities.&#13;
These are, of course, indirect estimates and need to be checked against the&#13;
material from studies of cost.&#13;
1/   In high income countries, a study of Australian public transport (Wallis,&#13;
p. 9) states: "for a typical suburban route now run by a public operator&#13;
and subsidized at the 60% level, transfer to a private operator might be&#13;
expected to reduce the subsidy required by some two-thirds, assuming no&#13;
change in fare level."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. Cost Comparisons&#13;
We now examine what evidence is available on the costs of the&#13;
private and publicly owned concerns in the cities.&#13;
Calcutta: Prior to 1966, Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC)&#13;
had a monopoly of service within the corporate limits. Through an inability&#13;
to meet the growth in demand, CSTC lost its monopoly (Thomas, 1977). By 1978&#13;
Calcutta was served by approximately 940 publicly owned CSTC buses, 1,500&#13;
private (usually owner operated) buses, and a large fleet of smaller para-&#13;
transit vehicles which will not be considered here. Some characteristics of&#13;
the private and public bus services are delineated in Annex 1.&#13;
According to figures quoted by private operators to a Government of&#13;
India Taxation Enquiry Board, the cost of operation in 1978 was about Rs 3.35&#13;
per km or Rs .096 per seat-km. Considering the forum, it is possible that&#13;
this figure is an overestimate. Based upon CSTC accounts, public buses in&#13;
1978 cost about Rs 6.32 per km or Rs .113 per seat-km.&#13;
Since buses in Calcutta are almost always full--often more than&#13;
three times as many passengers as seats during peak periods--cost as a func-&#13;
tion of capacity (seated and standing) better reflects vehicle utilization&#13;
and is more meaningful. Based upon gross capacity, private buses are even&#13;
less expensive relatively with a cost of Rs .051 per capacity-km for private&#13;
buses and Rs 0.78 per capacity-km for public ones. These figures show private&#13;
buses to cost 53% of public bus costs on a km basis, 85% on a seat-km basis&#13;
and 65% on a capacity-km basis. 1/&#13;
Bangkok is served by some 4,000 publicly owned Bangkok Mass Transit&#13;
Authority (BMTA) buses, about 10,000 private buses and minibuses and a large&#13;
number of smaller private public transport vehicles. Reliable financial sta-&#13;
tistics are unavailable for public and private operators. Therefore, in&#13;
this case, one can only look at the "bottom line." BMTA was created in 1976&#13;
through the consolidation of 22 private and 2 public companies.     Though some&#13;
of these companies were profitable, in 1978 BMTA covered only 70% of its costs&#13;
(not including interest on accumulated debt). Annex 2 gives further details&#13;
on transport in Bangkok.&#13;
In FY77-78 BMTA lost Baht 350 million (US$17 million), and in&#13;
1979-80 it would have been Baht 950 (US$47 million) provided that there is&#13;
no more than 10% reduction in its passenger rate. The BMTA can break even by&#13;
doubling the fare to Baht 2 (US$0.10). In July 1979 it was decided to raise&#13;
the fare to Baht 1.5 but even so it is expected to continue to require a&#13;
subsidy of about Baht 500 million (US$25 million) in 1979-80.&#13;
1/   Evidence to counter the argument of selectivity bias may be adduced by&#13;
comparing the cost of private bus operation in Calcutta with the public&#13;
operators in Bombay (BEST) which is considered to be the most efficient&#13;
public company in India (Commerce). Even so, the private operators'&#13;
cost is lower per km.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Istanbul is served by approximately 750 publicly owned Istanbul&#13;
Electric Tramways and Tunnel (IETT) buses, about 3,500 privately owned (one&#13;
half owner operated) minibuses and midibuses, and a very large fleet of dolmus&#13;
(exclusive and s'ared-ride taxis) and 100 IETT trolley buses which will not be&#13;
considered here. Some characteristics of the public bus and private minibus&#13;
services are presented in Annex 3.&#13;
In 1977 the cost of operation for an IETT bus was about LT 20-23&#13;
effective km or LT 0.5-0.55 per seat-km. In the same year minibuses cost&#13;
LT 2.7 per km or LT 0.27 per seat-km. Minibuses, even on a seat-km basis,&#13;
cost under half as much to operate, and provided service to almost twice as&#13;
many passengers as the stage bus without subsidy.&#13;
Australia. In 1975 Australian cities with over 10,000 population&#13;
had 9,120 buses, of which 4,168 (46%) were owned by private companies. A&#13;
study of average costs for a sample of public and private operations in&#13;
1972-73 gave the result presented in Table 2.1.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
The far right column shows the unit cost of the bus system as a proportion&#13;
of the figure for MTT in Hobart (a fairly typical public operator in terms of&#13;
its average cost). On average, unit private bus costs were estimated to be&#13;
between 50% and 65% of those of the typical public operator. 1/&#13;
New York Metropolitan Area: In 1974-75 a study estimated the&#13;
average cost of public bus operation to be about 11% to 15% higher per hour than&#13;
private bus operation. The weighted average private bus costs per vehicle-hour&#13;
in 1974 and 1975 were $19.76 and $21.40. For the public operator the costs&#13;
per vehicle hour were $22.14 and $23.82 respectively. 2/ The relatively small&#13;
difference in cost may be a result of the stringent regulation of private&#13;
operators and the extensive unionization in the New York area. In this study&#13;
average cost rose with size of the firm. The two largest operators with&#13;
2,400 and 1,400 buses respectively had a mean cost of $24.40 per vehicle hour.&#13;
Nine smaller bus firms with a maximum of 310 buses had an average aggregate&#13;
cost of $18.05. This is an interesting observation because public operators&#13;
tend to be large and private bus firms tend to be small with the owner-&#13;
operator common in low-income countries.&#13;
1/   The study countered the charge that a simplified comparison of average&#13;
cost per km would not account for different operators running different&#13;
services in different operating conditions as follows: "However, the&#13;
results quoted here are a summary of more complex analyses in which,&#13;
wherever possible, costs of the various operators were subdivided into&#13;
several components and in particular into components which would be&#13;
expected to vary with the hours operated, the distance run and the&#13;
number of buses in the fleet (by the method described in Travers Morgan&#13;
1978). Unit costs for each component were then used to synthesize the&#13;
costs for various operators to run a typical public bus operation&#13;
(actually MTT Hobart). The relative costs obtained were very similar&#13;
to those already presented. Other analyses on this subject (Gilmour&#13;
1974) reached the same conclusion when using similar methods to compare&#13;
the Melbourne public and private bus operations.&#13;
Thus it is safe to conclude that, on average, the unit costs for private&#13;
operators in Australian urban areas are only between one-half and two-&#13;
thirds of those of public operators in providing a similar service."&#13;
(Wallis, 1979, p. 4).&#13;
2/   These figures are based on data in Annex 4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Table 2.2- brings together the summary results for the five cities.&#13;
Because of the rough nature of operating cost data and the limited scope for&#13;
interpretation, the cost comparisons should be taken as a tentative corrobora-&#13;
tion of the implications of the data on subsidies. It seems that private&#13;
operators with a substantial subsidy can provide about the same service as&#13;
public operators. 1/&#13;

/a   Based on implied costs, not on cost study.&#13;
1/   It does not follow that private operators are always and everywhere less&#13;
costly than public operators. One study, Fouracre and Maunder (1979),&#13;
shows that in Surabaya (Indonesia) the public operator of large buses had&#13;
seat mile costs which were only 50% of those of the minibus operators.&#13;
This appears to be a neat reversal of the general rule found in other&#13;
cities where the cost evidence has been broadly consistent with the&#13;
figures for Surabaya. Our credibility is stretched, however, by the fact&#13;
that private minibuses are flourishing and earning profits. Thus, if the&#13;
average minibus profit on turnover were only 1% and if the load factor of&#13;
buses and minibuses were the same, the public bus corporation would earn&#13;
more than 50% profit on turnover, and probably 200% to 300% on capital.&#13;
Jacobs Fouracre and Maunder (1979) report that profits of buses (1976)&#13;
were only 27% of turnover which suggests that the load factor of minibuses&#13;
is much higher than buses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Questions concerning the quality of the service are tackled next.&#13;
C. Private Operators--Exploitation and Quality&#13;
Table 2.3 lists most of the many charges made against private bus&#13;
operations. The four main criticisms are that private operators exploit labor,&#13;
have poor financial practices, contribute to traffic anarchy, and that levels&#13;
of service deteriorate. The evidence is now examined.&#13;
One concern shared by many observers from high income countries is&#13;
that private operators pay low wages for long hours. In all cases we have&#13;
examined, employees of the private companies were paid lower wages with fewer&#13;
benefits than their counterparts in the public sector. However, private bus&#13;
employees seemed to be earning normal or above normal wages. In Istanbul and&#13;
Calcutta private bus. workers earn more than the average income for bus riders.&#13;
1/ Because of the greater flexibility of labor contracts in the private&#13;
sector (e.g., the driver doing simple maintenance and repairs, and employment&#13;
of part time-workers), the wage cost per bus hour are likely to be much&#13;
lower than the wage costs in the public sector. Wage costs of the private&#13;
sector are not inflated by the absenteeism characteristic of public operators.&#13;
And by maintaining market wage rates and non-restrictive labor practices&#13;
the private operators maintain appropriate capital-labor ratios and insure&#13;
that there is no inefficient substitution of capital for labor.&#13;
1/   In Istanbul drivers earn about LT 50,000/year and in 1973, 90% of all&#13;
households earned less than that (Sanli 1977). In Calculata drivers&#13;
earn about Rs 1,000/month and conductors Rs 500/month. The average&#13;
income of bus riders in the same year was Rs 547/month (Thomas 1977).&#13;
Even the "lowly" caller in Calcutta earned Rs 75/month which is about&#13;
the Rs 100/month earnings of a slum household in Calcutta (Commerce&#13;
1978). In some cities private bus and minibus employees receive pensions&#13;
and other benefits (Buenos Aires, for example) and the operators remain&#13;
competitive.&#13;

It is often alleged that private bus operators make inadequate&#13;
financial and insurance provisions and live from hand to mouth (or from fare&#13;
box to gas tank), thus skimping on depreciation and maintenance of their&#13;
vehicle. In some cases (Bangkok, and the early days of the minibus in&#13;
Hong Kong), it is suggested that, through the operation of the loan shark&#13;
and protection rackets, they fall into the hands of gangsters and racketeers.&#13;
It is difficult to test all these assertions. But some clearly are&#13;
not generally true. In Calcutta and Istanbul, private firms have much better&#13;
maintained buses than the publicly owned concerns (Commerce 1979, Thomas 1977).&#13;
Observers in Bangkok claim that private minibuses often overload and are&#13;
unsafe--but it is not clear that on the average they are worse maintained&#13;
than the public buses. One would expect that the standard of maintenance&#13;
and safety of passengers in the private sector would respond to passenger&#13;
demand. The clientele gets as much safety as it wants at the going price.&#13;
It would be patronizing to impose higher or even Western standards (and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
costs) of road safety on people whose priorities lie elsewhere. 1/ One might&#13;
expect owner-operators to drive more carefully to protect their investment&#13;
and generally to take better care of their vehicles than would hired drivers.&#13;
Huddard, in an unpublished study of accidents in Mombasa, where common wisdom&#13;
is to attribute the majority of accidents to the minibuses (mutatus), found no&#13;
significant increase in accident rates between 1972 when there were no mutatus&#13;
and 1977/78 when 1,270 mutatus were in operation. Sanli, discussing Istanbul,&#13;
suggests that differential financial constraints (high interest rates, high&#13;
taxes, etc.) on private bus operations contribute to overloading, poor driving&#13;
habits, and too long hours. But there seems to be no concrete evidence to&#13;
support the allegation of "higher accident rates." The charge in unproven.&#13;
The most common fault attributed to private bus operators, partic-&#13;
ularly in low-income countries, is that they contribute to congestion. Such&#13;
allegations need to be put in perspective. For example, in Bangkok there are&#13;
about 12,000 paratransit vehicles in operation and over 220,000 private cars,&#13;
with the former running near full occupancy during peak periods and with the&#13;
latter rarely being occupied by more than two people. The culprit is the car,&#13;
not the bus.&#13;
In any case, in order to reduce congestion, traffic rule enforcement,&#13;
priority lanes for buses and private minibuses, separate and distinct minibus&#13;
stops, and a host of traffic management techniques for all traffic can be used&#13;
to improve traffic flow. And the private sector has contributed some ingenious&#13;
systems of its own. To maintain orderly and evenly spaced running, in Calcutta&#13;
a private bus driver must pay a fine to the driver behind him if he runs late&#13;
(Roth 1979).&#13;
The most persistent charge against private operators is that they&#13;
serve only profitable routes and that where they ply levels of service deteri-&#13;
orate. In Calcutta and Istanbul, however, the public operators have first&#13;
choice of routes. -There is some evidence that they choose the most desirable&#13;
profitable routes and leave the less desirable routes to the private operators.&#13;
In Calcutta, the private operators are also generally restricted to areas&#13;
outside the city center with much poorer road conditions. In Bangkok, the&#13;
minibuses serve the sois (usually narrow and sometimes unpaved side roads)&#13;
where buses cannot ply. In Istanbul, minibuses have served profitably routes&#13;
dropped by IETT. Sanli, p. 6, observed that "it is also the dolmus and espe-&#13;
cially the minibus system which provides transport service to the squatter&#13;
areas (settlements declared illegal by the municipality) where substantial new&#13;
growth takes place but provision of essential service, including municipal bus&#13;
transport, has been withheld." This evidence seems to counter the charges&#13;
that private operators only serve the "best" or most profitable routes.&#13;
1/   There is, of course, the issue of third party costs of accidents, but this&#13;
is general to all vehicles and is not particular to private bus operators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Another charge is that the private bus operators take only the&#13;
"cream" of the traffic peak.  But such "creaming" may benefit publicly owned&#13;
bus operators because it reduces resource requirements for the peak. It has&#13;
been estimated, for example, that the public bus concern in Bangkok would need&#13;
40% more buses to serve the peak and this would increase its deficit substan-&#13;
tially. The "cream" is apparently not always good for the healt., of the&#13;
nationalized firm.&#13;
Other arguments suggesting levels of service deteriorate when&#13;
private operators ply have been discredited by empirical evidence. In&#13;
Calcutta private buses were more evenly spaced, marginally more comfortable&#13;
and less subject to breakdown, and have "better general appearance and per-&#13;
formance" (Thomas 1977, p. 19) than publicly owned buses. In Istanbul (SAMAD&#13;
(1979)) and in Chiengmai (Fouracre (1977)) and most other cities where they&#13;
operate minibuses had faster operating speeds than the public buses. Since&#13;
private operators often find it profitable to use minibuses, levels of service&#13;
improve through increased frequencies of public transport services.&#13;
Thus, it appears many of the problems described in Table 2.3 are&#13;
figments of the imagination. Some involve impositions of Western standards&#13;
on LDCs and some have much cheaper alternative solutions.&#13;
III. CONCLUSION&#13;
Where public and private operators both ply at the same fare,&#13;
private operators provide equivalent if not better services at no subsidy&#13;
(or two-thirds less in the case of Australia) and public operators require&#13;
massive subsidy support. Private operators generally appear to be 50-65%&#13;
less expensive than public buses and in addition they usually pay large sums&#13;
of money into government treasuries. Obviously cost is only one side of the&#13;
coin with level of service being the other. We have attempted to show how&#13;
often the charges against private operators are not supported by the data&#13;
and, even if they were, there are much more cost effective solutions than&#13;
banning them. Because of restriction on fares, demand far exceeds supply&#13;
in many cities, and if the private operators were quickly removed from the&#13;
scene the public operators could carry the total traffic only with greatly&#13;
increased subsidy. In addition, these private operators have cropped up&#13;
locally, respond quickly and efficiently to the market, often provide a&#13;
myriad of other services (such as works buses, goods movement, delivery&#13;
services, etc.), use local expertise and materials rather than imported,&#13;
and are very adaptable.&#13;
Finally one may reflect that the disparities between public and&#13;
private ownership are so large there is a good prima facie case for opening&#13;
up all nationalized bus monopolies to private operators of either buses or&#13;
minibuses. The implications of such a policy are, however, far beyond the&#13;
objectives of this paper.&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BUS COSTS IN CALCUTTA&#13;
Calcutta is served by approximately 940 publicly owned CSTC buses,&#13;
1,500 private buses and a large fleet of minibuses, deluxe buses, taxis&#13;
and rickshaws. Some characteristics of Calcutta's bus services are presented&#13;
in Table 1. Only about 47% of the buses of the publicly owned bus fleet are&#13;
effectively in operation on a given day. CSTC also suffers from undercapital-&#13;
ization leading to overaged vehicles (Thomas (1977) and an effective trade&#13;
union leading to very high manning and benefit levels (Thomas (1977)). CSTC&#13;
has suffered from high absenteeism accounting for a 10% loss in effective bus&#13;
kilometers, and high fare leakage of about 20% of revenues.&#13;
The 1,500 privately owned buses generally are owned by owner&#13;
operators, who are members of route associations which set schedules and fines&#13;
for late running. Fares are set at the same rate as public buses, and entry&#13;
and routes are regulated by local authorities. Private buses do not often&#13;
directly compete with public buses and tend to serve routes outside the&#13;
central business district (Thomas (1977)).&#13;
Private and Public Bus Costs&#13;
In 1978 private operators reported their costs to be Rs 3.35 per km&#13;
to a Government of India Taxation Inquiry Board. (Parker's estimate yearly&#13;
cost Rs 231,000). If one accepts estimates of daily mileage of 200 km and&#13;
uses a utilization of 90% or 330 days per year, this suggests a cost per km&#13;
of Rs 3.5 (or 5% more than operator estimates) which is well within the errors&#13;
of calculation of such figures. The cost per seat-km for the 35 passenger&#13;
buses is .096 and per capacity (66 passengers) km is Rs .051 (Table 2.2)&#13;
According to their accounts CSTC buses cost Rs 184 million&#13;
(Rs 505,342/day) in 1977/78 to operate. Based upon a total daily kilometerage&#13;
of 80,000 the cost per bus-km is Rs 6.317. The bus fleet has an average&#13;
seating capacity of 56 seats and therefore costs Rs .113 per seat km and has&#13;
an average full capacity of 81 passengers costing Rs .078 per capacity km.&#13;
The average capacity was based upon a fleet of 45% double-deckers with&#13;
72 seats and a capacity of 96; 3% articulated buses with 98 seats and a&#13;
capacity of 130, and 52% single-deckers with 34 seats and a capacity of 66&#13;
passengers (Thomas (1977)).&#13;
A Consistency Test&#13;
CSTC covers about 60% of its total operating costs. Private operator&#13;
costs are about 65% of public costs per capacity-km. Based upon this alone the&#13;
private operators should be covering about 92% of these costs. However, fare&#13;
leakage on public buses is estimated to be about 20% and for private buses has&#13;
been estimated to be near zero because of family control and because wages for&#13;
all crew members are based upon a percentage of daily revenues (Business India&#13;
(1979)). If fare leakage is below 12%, private operators on an average would&#13;
be making a profit, even with our rough private bus cost estimates.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BUS COSTS IN BANGKOK&#13;
The publicly owned BMTA was created in 1976 through the consolidation&#13;
of 22 private and 2 public bus companies. Most of the private companies were&#13;
profitable at the time of consolidation. Today, BMTA covers 70% of its costs.&#13;
With most of its maintenance on private contract, BMTA had over 92% avail-&#13;
ability for its fleet with only a 3% breakdown rate in 1978.&#13;
Private minibuses began to expand rapidly in 1975. Guesstimates&#13;
of their numbers are that about 6,000 were operating by 1977. Their numbers&#13;
dropped when BMTA became fully operational and then rapidly increased to about&#13;
10,000 to 12,000 when it became apparent that BMTA could not meet the demand&#13;
(Jamieson MacKay (1979)).&#13;
Minibuses operate on fixed routes, often on BMTA routes, with the&#13;
route number marked on the vehicle. The flat fare of Baht 1 was the same as&#13;
for BMTA buses up to July 1979, although it may be higher late at night and&#13;
in certain sparsely populated areas where bus services are marginal. There&#13;
are no effective controls on the number of vehicles in operation, routing,&#13;
fares, times of operation, vehicle types and standards, or entry into the&#13;
market.&#13;

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BUS COSTS IN ISTANBUL&#13;
Istanbul is served by 750 publicly owned IETT buses, about 3,500&#13;
privately owned minibuses and midibuses, and a large fleet of Dolmus, taxis&#13;
and trolleybuses. With its in-house maintenance, only about 60% (or 450) of&#13;
the buses of its publicly owned bus fleet were effectively in operation on&#13;
the average in 1978. IETT had high manning and wage levels, a severe revenue&#13;
shortage due to concessional fares (20% of travel), fares fixed in money&#13;
values and decreasing in real terms, and poor operating and maintenance&#13;
conditions. In 1977 IETT had a deficit of LT 725 million (63% of total&#13;
operating cost) or about LT 0.4 per bus-km.&#13;
The 3,300 privately owned minibuses operate at least 300 days per&#13;
bus per year (over an 80% level of utilization) (Sanli (1977)). Fares are&#13;
set at about the same level as public bus fares but are slightly higher for&#13;
journeys of over 12 km. Fares, entry and routes are regulated by local&#13;
authorities although illegal operations exist and are tolerated (Sanli (1977)).&#13;
Minibuses do not directly compete with public buses since most of their routes&#13;
serve areas outside the central business district.&#13;

LT 50,000 for a minibus license (Sanli) depreciated over 8 years at 10%&#13;
interest.(Note that this is depreciation in current and not historical&#13;
values.) Annual profit is also derived from Sanli's figures:&#13;
Net revenue:  LT 300/day for 300 days                  LT 90,000&#13;
- depreciation           LT 30,000&#13;
- maintenance &amp; tires    LT 34,150&#13;
- license fees           LT  4,500         68,650&#13;
LT 21,350&#13;
This is 12% of revenue and a rate of return of at least 20% on capital.&#13;
(Sanli estimated the average profit of LT 35,000-55,000 per vehicle for&#13;
paratransit generally in Istanbul.)&#13;
/c   Not available.&#13;
A Consistency Test&#13;
IETT covers 37% of its cost. According to these estimates private&#13;
operators provide seat-km at 51% of IETT cost. Therefore, based upon these&#13;
estimates and allowing for the full 20% concessionary fares, minibuses would&#13;
be covering only about 88% of their costs. However, Sanli's interviews sug-&#13;
gested that there was a 12% profit on revenues. The difference between a&#13;
12% loss and a 12% profit is, of course, considerable, but in view of the&#13;
sources of the data, not unbridgeable. The obvious sources of discrepancy&#13;
are: (a) minibus costs have been much overestimated; (b) minibuses have&#13;
higher load factors; and (c) fare leakages are lower for minibuses.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Efficiency in urban bus operation
            depends on, among other things, the institutional form of
            the bus business. For certain cities in LDCs where there are
            parallel private and publicly owned operations, it is
            demonstrated that the costs of private provision are between
            50 percent to 60 percent of those of publicly owned
            concerns. Additional evidence is adduced to show that the
            quality of private bus services is not markedly inferior and
            usually superior to the public bus operation.
