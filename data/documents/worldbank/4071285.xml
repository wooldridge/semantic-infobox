FOREWORD&#13;
&#13;
Development is about people. But to measure development and see its effect on people, we need good statistics. Statistics that tell us&#13;
&#13;
that life expectancy in the last 40 years has gone up 20 years in developing countries, more than in all the time before that. That litera-&#13;
&#13;
cy has improved. That infant mortality and maternal mortality have decreased. And that fewer people are living in extreme poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
However, the statistics also tell us that malnutrition and disease still claim the lives of millions of young children. That millions more never&#13;
&#13;
receive a primary education. And that in countries at the center of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, life expectancy has been falling. Of the 6 billion&#13;
&#13;
people on the planet today, 5 billion live in developing countries. But in the next 30 years the world's population will grow by 2 billion--from&#13;
&#13;
6 billion to 8 billion--and all but 50 million of them will live in today's developing countries. What will their lives be like? We hope, much&#13;
&#13;
better than today.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Millennium Development Goals set specific targets for improving people's lives. They were proposed and adopted by the General&#13;
&#13;
Assembly of the United Nations--not as vague and lofty statements of our good intentions, but as a practical guide to what can and should&#13;
&#13;
be accomplished by the international community in the opening quarter of the 21st century. That is why they were presented so clearly,&#13;
&#13;
with precise, quantified targets, based on widely accepted statistical indicators. Setting goals and measuring progress toward them in a&#13;
&#13;
transparent process is a proven management technique for holding our focus, avoiding wasteful diversions of effort, and encouraging&#13;
&#13;
robust public discussion of both means and ends.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Since the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals another important step in deepening the international consensus on develop-&#13;
&#13;
ment was the Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development. At Monterrey developing countries recognized the need to put reduc-&#13;
&#13;
ing poverty and achieving the human and environmental goals of the Millennium Declaration at the center of their development programs.&#13;
&#13;
Developed countries accepted an obligation to uphold their share of a partnership for development by providing resources, opening trade,&#13;
&#13;
and relieving the burden of debt on the poorest countries. That consensus requires monitoring not only the outcomes in developing&#13;
&#13;
countries--but also the policies and actions of rich countries and development agencies to meet their commitments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A comprehensive development strategy calls for a comprehensive set of statistics. Any user of World Development Indicators recognizes&#13;
&#13;
the many gaps in sound, available information. At the World Bank we are committed to working with our partners to improve the quality&#13;
&#13;
and availability of development statistics. This effort starts with strengthening national statistical systems in developing countries. But it&#13;
&#13;
must be matched by a commitment of the international community to provide the necessary technical and financial support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank's mission statement asks us to "fight poverty with passion and professionalism for lasting results." Ultimately, it is the&#13;
&#13;
results that count. If we act now with realism and foresight based on good information, if we think globally and allocate our resources&#13;
&#13;
accordingly, we can make a lasting difference in people's lives.&#13;

PREFACE&#13;
&#13;
Four years have passed since the Millennium Development Goals sharpened the focus on measuring the results of development--not the&#13;
&#13;
number of projects undertaken or the dollars spent, but the improvements in people's lives. The emphasis on quantitative targets and&#13;
&#13;
the requirement for monitoring progress on country poverty reduction strategies have increased the demand for statistics. And that&#13;
&#13;
showed us how deficient the statistical systems are in many parts of the developing world. Good statistics are not just a technical issue--&#13;
&#13;
they are a development issue, requiring concerted action by the entire global community. As Trevor Manuel, South Africa's minister of&#13;
&#13;
finance, has put it, "If you can't measure it, you can't manage it."&#13;
&#13;
    That is why data, statistics, and indicators are at the heart of the results agenda. Governments need them. Politicians need them.&#13;
&#13;
Managers of development programs need them. And citizens need them--to hold governments accountable for their actions and their results.&#13;
&#13;
    The global effort to improve the quality of development statistics has three pillars:&#13;
&#13;
    ·   Strengthening the capacity of developing countries to produce, analyze, and use reliable statistics.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   Providing financial support to countries expanding their statistical capacity.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   Improving the quality and availability of international statistics for monitoring global progress.&#13;
&#13;
    Much is already happening. Around the world, 37 developing countries have prepared strategic plans to guide their statistical devel-&#13;
&#13;
opment. The African Development Bank is systematically carrying out statistical assessments in 47 countries in that region, a key step&#13;
&#13;
in identifying shortcomings and constraints and in better targeting support. The Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building, managed by&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank, has provided grants to support statistical projects in more than 60 countries.&#13;
&#13;
    Interagency cooperation is much stronger than it was even two years ago. Joint efforts have improved the measurement of such indi-&#13;
&#13;
cators as child mortality and immunizations. And the International Comparison Program is proceeding with an ambitious plan to measure&#13;
&#13;
purchasing power parities in more than 100 countries.&#13;
&#13;
    Much has been achieved, but much remains to be done. The Second Roundtable on Development Results--held at Marrakech,&#13;
&#13;
Morocco, and sponsored by the multilateral development banks and the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for&#13;
&#13;
Economic Co-operation and Development--identified six broad sets of actions to improve national and international statistics:&#13;
&#13;
    ·   Mainstream the strategic planning of statistical systems and help all low-income countries prepare national statistical develop-&#13;
&#13;
        ment strategies by 2006.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   Strengthen preparations for the 2010 censuses. A core source of development statistics, censuses underpin the ability to moni-&#13;
&#13;
        tor progress toward the Millennium Development Goals.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   Increase financial support for statistical capacity building. Countries that adopt good policies for their statistical systems should&#13;
&#13;
        receive the financial support they need for their statistics.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   Set up an international household survey network to coordinate and improve the effectiveness of international survey programs.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   Undertake urgent improvements needed to monitor the Millennium Development Goals for 2005.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   Increase the accountability of the international statistical system.&#13;
&#13;
    Good quality information is not produced overnight. We plan today for better information tomorrow. In doing so, we must be careful&#13;
&#13;
not to overburden fragile national systems. We must also recognize that the cost of making mistakes and allocating resources inefficiently&#13;
&#13;
can dwarf the cost of producing good statistics.&#13;
&#13;
    World Development Indicators reflects the strengths and weaknesses of the international statistical system. As development statis-&#13;
&#13;
tics improve, the results will appear here--as we continue striving to meet the needs of policymakers, researchers, commentators, and&#13;
&#13;
interested citizens. You can find out more about our products at http://www.worldbank.org/data. And you can send queries and comments&#13;

PARTNERS&#13;
&#13;
Defining, gathering, and disseminating international statistics is a collective effort of many people and&#13;
organizations. The indicators presented in World Development Indicators are the fruit of decades of work&#13;
at many levels, from the field workers who administer censuses and household surveys to the committees&#13;
and working parties of the national and international statistical agencies that develop the nomenclature,&#13;
classifications, and standards fundamental to an international statistical system. Nongovernmental organ-&#13;
izations and the private sector have also made important contributions, both in gathering primary data and&#13;
in organizing and publishing their results. And academic researchers have played a crucial role in develop-&#13;
ing statistical methods and carrying on a continuing dialogue about the quality and interpretation of statis-&#13;
tical indicators. All these contributors have a strong belief that available, accurate data will improve the&#13;
quality of public and private decisionmaking.&#13;
   The organizations listed here have made World Development Indicators possible by sharing their data&#13;
and their expertise with us. More important, their collaboration contributes to the World Bank's efforts, and&#13;
to those of many others, to improve the quality of life of the world's people. We acknowledge our debt and&#13;
gratitude to all who have helped to build a base of comprehensive, quantitative information about the world&#13;
and its people.&#13;

International Monetary Fund&#13;
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was established at a conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire,&#13;
United States, on July 1­22, 1944. (The conference also established the World Bank.) The IMF came into&#13;
official existence on December 27, 1945, and commenced financial operations on March 1, 1947. It cur-&#13;
rently has 184 member countries.&#13;
    The statutory purposes of the IMF are to promote international monetary cooperation, facilitate the&#13;
expansion and balanced growth of international trade, promote exchange rate stability, help to establish a&#13;
multilateral payments system, make the general resources of the IMF temporarily available to its members&#13;
under adequate safeguards, and shorten the duration and lessen the degree of disequilibrium in the inter-&#13;
national balance of payments of members.&#13;
    The IMF maintains an extensive program for developing and compiling international statistics and is respon-&#13;
sible for collecting and reporting statistics on international financial transactions and the balance of payments.&#13;
In April 1996 it undertook an important initiative to improve the quality of international statistics, establishing the&#13;
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) to guide members that have, or seek, access to international cap-&#13;
ital markets in providing economic and financial data to the public. In 1997 the IMF established the General Data&#13;
Dissemination System (GDDS) to guide countries in providing the public with comprehensive, timely, accessible,&#13;
and reliable economic, financial, and sociodemographic data. Building on this work, the IMF established the Data&#13;
Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) to assess data quality in subject areas such as debt and poverty. The&#13;
DQAF comprises dimensions of data quality such as methodological soundness, accuracy, serviceability, and&#13;
accessibility. In 1999 work began on Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), which sum-&#13;
marize the extent to which countries observe certain internationally recognized standards and codes in areas&#13;
including data, monetary and financial policy transparency, fiscal transparency, banking supervision, securities,&#13;
insurance, payments systems, corporate governance, accounting, auditing, and insolvency and creditor rights.&#13;
    The IMF's major statistical publications include International Financial Statistics, Balance of Payments&#13;
Statistics Yearbook, Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, and Direction of Trade Statistics Yearbook.&#13;

International Telecommunication Union&#13;
Founded in Paris in 1865 as the International Telegraph Union, the International Telecommunication Union&#13;
(ITU) took its current name in 1934 and became a specialized agency of the United Nations in 1947. The&#13;
ITU is unique among international organizations in that it was founded on the principle of cooperation&#13;
between governments and the private sector. With a membership encompassing telecommunication poli-&#13;
cymakers and regulators, network operators, equipment manufacturers, hardware and software developers,&#13;
regional standards-making organizations, and financing institutions, ITU's activities, policies, and strategic&#13;
direction are determined and shaped by the industry it serves.&#13;
    The ITU's standardization activities, which have already helped foster the growth of new technologies such&#13;
as mobile telephony and the Internet, are now being put to use in defining the building blocks of the emerging&#13;
global information infrastructure and in designing advanced multimedia systems that deftly handle a mix of&#13;
voice, data, audio, and video signals. ITU's continuing role in managing the radio-frequency spectrum ensures&#13;
that radio-based systems such as cellular phones and pagers, aircraft and maritime navigation systems, scien-&#13;
tific research stations, satellite communication systems, and radio and television broadcasting continue to&#13;

Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&#13;
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) was set up in 1948 as the&#13;
Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) to administer Marshall Plan funding in Europe. In&#13;
1960, when the Marshall Plan had completed its task, the OEEC's member countries agreed to bring in&#13;
Canada and the United States to form an organization to coordinate policy among industrial countries. The&#13;
OECD is the international organization of the industrialized, market economy countries. Representatives of&#13;
member countries meet at the OECD to exchange information and harmonize policy with a view to maxi-&#13;
mizing economic growth in member countries and helping nonmember countries develop more rapidly.&#13;
   The OECD has set up a number of specialized committees to further its aims. One of these is the&#13;
Development Assistance Committee (DAC), whose members have agreed to coordinate their policies on&#13;
assistance to developing and transition economies. Also associated with the OECD are several agencies or&#13;
bodies that have their own governing statutes, including the International Energy Agency and the Centre for&#13;
Co-operation with Economies in Transition.&#13;
   The OECD's main statistical publications include Geographical Distribution of Financial Flows to Aid&#13;
Recipients, National Accounts of OECD Countries, Labour Force Statistics, Revenue Statistics of OECD&#13;
Member Countries, International Direct Investment Statistics Yearbook, Basic Science and Technology&#13;
Statistics, Industrial Structure Statistics, Trends in International Migration, and Services: Statistics on&#13;

T&#13;
   he Millennium Development Goals put the world community on a time table. When 189&#13;
&#13;
member states of the United Nations adopted the Millennium Declaration in September&#13;
&#13;
2000, they looked backwards to 1990 and ahead to 2015 and gave themselves 25 years&#13;
&#13;
to produce substantial improvements in the lives of people. At the time, it was clear that in&#13;
&#13;
many places development progress had slowed and would have to be accelerated if the&#13;
&#13;
ambitious targets of the Millennium Development Goals were to be achieved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
As in the past four editions, this section of World Development Indicators reviews progress&#13;
&#13;
toward the major development goals. Until recently we have been gauging progress toward&#13;
&#13;
the Millennium Development Goals based on the record of the 1990s. Now, we are closer&#13;
&#13;
to 2015 than to 1990, and we are getting our first look at the record of the 21st century.&#13;
&#13;
There are hopeful signs. Global poverty rates continue to fall. Fewer people are living in&#13;
&#13;
extreme poverty, after an increase in the late 1990s. In countries that have laid a good&#13;
&#13;
foundation for growth, indicators of social development are also improving. But progress is&#13;
&#13;
uneven. Slow growth, low educational achievement, poor health, and civil disturbances&#13;
&#13;
remain obstacles for many.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It is still too early to conclude that the world as a whole is on track to achieve the&#13;
&#13;
Millennium Development Goals--or that it is not. What is clear is that the goals remain a&#13;
&#13;
great challenge and that hard work lies ahead.&#13;

lines may be set even higher.                                                         weaker. In looking ahead, income distribution is assumed to&#13;

Over the next 11 years gross domestic product (GDP) in low- and                       will fall to 12.7 percent--less than half the 1990 level of&#13;

   New estimates of poverty rates, based on reexamination of                          the $1 a day poverty line in China will dominate global totals. In&#13;
household survey data back to 1981, show that global trends in                        Europe and Central Asia and in the Middle East and North Africa,&#13;

and the East Asia and Pacific region. GDP per capita more than                        tion of current trends will cut poverty rates to half their current&#13;

from 56 percent to 16 percent. Poverty also fell in South Asia                        reach or exceed the target. But growth and poverty reduction are&#13;
over the past 20 years, and while the decline was not as rapid,                       proceeding more slowly in Latin America and the Caribbean,&#13;
almost 50 million fewer people were living in extreme poverty by                      which will not reach the target unless growth picks up. The most&#13;
2001. But in Sub-Saharan Africa, where GDP per capita shrank                          difficult case is Sub-Saharan Africa, where poverty has increased&#13;

in 2001, and an additional 140 million people were living in                          11 years, unless there is a major change in prospects.&#13;

Note: Goals, targets, and indicators effective September 8, 2003.&#13;
a. For monitoring country poverty trends, indicators based on national poverty lines should be used, where available. b. An alternative indicator under development is "primary completion&#13;
rate." c. Among contraceptive methods, only condoms are effective in preventing HIV transmission. Since the condom use rate is only measured among women in union, it is supplemented by&#13;
an indicator on condom use in high-risk situations (indicator 19a) and an indicator on HIV/AIDS knowledge (indicator 19b). Indicator 19c (contraceptive prevalence rate) is also useful in track-&#13;
ing progress in other health, gender, and poverty goals. d. This indicator is defined as the percentage of 15- to 24-year-olds who correctly identify the two major ways of preventing the sexual&#13;
transmission of HIV (using condoms and limiting sex to one faithful, uninfected partner), who reject the two most common local misconceptions about HIV transmission, and who know that a&#13;
healthy-looking person can transmit HIV. However, since there are currently not a sufficient number of surveys to be able to calculate the indicator as defined above, UNICEF, in collaboration&#13;
with UNAIDS and WHO, produced two proxy indicators that represent two components of the actual indicator. They are the percentage of women and men ages 15­24 who know that a person&#13;
can protect herself from HIV infection by "consistent use of condom," and the percentage of women and men ages 15­24 who know a healthy-looking person can transmit HIV. e. Prevention&#13;
to be measured by the percentage of children under age five sleeping under insecticide-treated bednets; treatment to be measured by percentage of children under age five who are appropri-&#13;
ately treated. f. An improved measure of the target for future years is under development by the International Labour Organization.&#13;

   he ultimate aim of development is to improve human welfare in a substantial way. But&#13;
&#13;
development has often bypassed the poor, and so attacking poverty directly through its&#13;
&#13;
many dimensions has become an urgent global priority.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
To accelerate progress in human development, economic growth is, of course, necessary.&#13;
&#13;
But it is not enough. Because the most significant asset of people poor is their labor, the&#13;
&#13;
most effective way to improve their welfare is to increase their employment opportunities&#13;
&#13;
and the productivity of their labor through investments in human capital--the product of&#13;
&#13;
education and improvements in health and nutrition. Thus freedom from illiteracy (figure&#13;
&#13;
2a) and freedom from illness are two of the most important ways that poor people can&#13;
&#13;
escape poverty. But although developing countries have made large investments in&#13;
&#13;
human capital, assisted by the private sector and official development agencies,&#13;
&#13;
good health and basic education remain elusive to many. To reinforce this paramount&#13;
&#13;
task of development, the Millennium Development Goals set specific targets for&#13;
&#13;
poverty reduction, education, status of women, and health, among others, in order to&#13;
&#13;
measure improvements in people's&#13;
                                      2a&#13;
lives (see section 1 for a fuller&#13;

The challenge for governments is&#13;
                                       80&#13;
formidable. They need to provide&#13;

&#13;
best available grouped data.&#13;
&#13;
   The distribution data have been adjusted for house-&#13;
&#13;
hold size, providing a more consistent measure of per&#13;
&#13;
capita income or consumption. No adjustment has&#13;
&#13;
been made for spatial differences in cost of living&#13;
&#13;
within countries, because the data needed for such&#13;
&#13;
calculations are generally unavailable. For further&#13;
&#13;
details on the estimation method for low- and middle-&#13;
&#13;
income economies, see Ravallion and Chen (1996).&#13;
&#13;
   Because the underlying household surveys differ in&#13;
&#13;
method and type of data collected, the distribution&#13;
&#13;
data are not strictly comparable across countries.&#13;
&#13;
These problems are diminishing as survey methods&#13;
&#13;
improve and become more standardized, but achiev-&#13;
&#13;
ing strict comparability is still impossible (see About&#13;
&#13;
the data for table 2.5).&#13;
&#13;
   Two sources of noncomparability should be noted in&#13;
&#13;
particular. First, the surveys can differ in many&#13;
&#13;
respects, including whether they use income or con-&#13;
&#13;
sumption expenditure as the living standard indicator.&#13;
&#13;
The distribution of income is typically more unequal&#13;
&#13;
than the distribution of consumption. In addition, the&#13;
&#13;
definitions of income used usually differ among sur-&#13;
&#13;
veys. Consumption is usually a much better welfare                                                          Data sources&#13;

indicator,   particularly   in  developing   countries.                                                     The data on distribution are compiled by the World&#13;
&#13;
Second, households differ in size (number of mem-                                                           Bank's Development Research Group using pri-&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
E&#13;
    conomic development has led to dramatic improvements in the quality of life in&#13;
&#13;
developing countries, producing gains unparalleled in human history. But the picture is far&#13;
&#13;
from entirely positive. Gains have been unevenly distributed, and a large part of the world's&#13;
&#13;
population remains desperately poor. At the same time, natural resources--land, water,&#13;
&#13;
and forests--are being degraded at alarming rates in many countries, and environmental&#13;
&#13;
factors such as indoor and outdoor air pollution, waterborne diseases, and exposure to&#13;
&#13;
toxic chemicals threaten the health of millions of people. Addressing these concerns,&#13;
&#13;
successive international conferences, including the latest World Summit on Sustainable&#13;
&#13;
Development,      have   reaffirmed   the  commitment     to  eliminate      poverty        through&#13;
&#13;
environmentally sound and socially responsible economic development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
If the vision of a world without poverty is to be realized, sustainable development is the&#13;
&#13;
key. A healthy environment is central to the international development agenda and an&#13;
&#13;
integral part of meeting the Millennium Development Goals (see section 1, World View).&#13;
&#13;
The Millennium Development Goals call for integrating principles of environmental&#13;
&#13;
sustainability into country policies and programs and reversing environmental losses. This&#13;
&#13;
requires measuring and monitoring the state of the environment and its changes as well as&#13;
&#13;
the links between the economy and the environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Given such close links, there is a strong argument for developing indicators that integrate&#13;
&#13;
economic activity and environmental change. One approach that appears to hold much&#13;
&#13;
promise is environmental accounting. Aimed at deriving "greener" measures of national&#13;
&#13;
income, savings, and wealth, environmental accounting adds natural resources and&#13;
&#13;
pollutants to the assets and liabilities measured in the standard national accounts. But&#13;
&#13;
preparing full-fledged integrated environmental and economic accounts is costly, and not all&#13;
&#13;
countries are doing so. In the absence of such integrated accounts, physical indicators and&#13;
&#13;
descriptive statistics can provide useful information for monitoring the state of the&#13;
&#13;
environment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Many such indicators are presented here, but despite greater awareness of the importance&#13;
&#13;
of environmental issues and efforts to improve environmental data, information on many&#13;
&#13;
aspects of the environment remains sparse. The available data are often of uneven quality,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                  2004 World Development Indicators  113&#13;

I&#13;
   n 2002 the world economy grew by 1.9 percent, a slight increase from 1.3 percent in&#13;
&#13;
2001, but below the 2.7 percent annual average in the 1990s. The world's recorded&#13;
&#13;
output--and income--grew by more than $1.1 trillion. Lower-middle-income economies saw&#13;
&#13;
the fastest growth, followed by low-income economies. Upper-middle-income economies,&#13;
&#13;
affected by slowing investment and widespread uncertainty in financial markets,&#13;
&#13;
experienced negative growth. High-income economies, accounting for 81 percent of the&#13;
&#13;
world's gross domestic product (GDP), almost doubled their growth over 2001, from 0.9&#13;
&#13;
percent to 1.6 percent (figure 4a).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Over the past decade economic growth was fastest in East Asia and Pacific (averaging 7.3&#13;
&#13;
percent a year) and South Asia (5.4 percent). Leading this growth were China and India,&#13;
&#13;
each accounting for more than 70 percent of its region's output. These two regions even did&#13;
&#13;
comparatively well in 2002, with East Asia registering 6.7 percent growth--demonstrating&#13;
&#13;
its continuing recovery from the financial crisis in 1998, when annual growth fell to 0.7&#13;
&#13;
percent--and South Asia recording 4.3 percent growth, a slight decline over 2001.&#13;

  Collecting and tabulating trade statistics are diffi-&#13;

cult. Some developing countries lack the capacity to&#13;

report timely data; this is a problem especially for&#13;
&#13;
countries that are landlocked and those whose terri-&#13;
&#13;
torial boundaries are porous. As a result, it is nec-&#13;
&#13;
essary to estimate their trade from the data reported&#13;
&#13;
by their partners. (For further discussion of the use&#13;

5 STATESAND MARKETS&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
S&#13;
    uccessful development requires that states complement markets, not substitute for&#13;
&#13;
them. States should focus on providing a good business environment--in which contracts&#13;
&#13;
are enforced, markets function, basic infrastructure is provided, and people (especially poor&#13;
&#13;
people) are empowered to participate. Government institutions can support the development&#13;
&#13;
of markets in many ways--by providing information, fostering competition, enforcing&#13;
&#13;
contracts, and helping to make credit available to entrepreneurs. By leveling the playing&#13;
&#13;
field, governments create opportunities for poor people to participate in markets and&#13;
&#13;
improve their standards of living and give them hope for a better future for their children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Good governance matters for long-term growth, but good policies and effective government&#13;
&#13;
spending also have immediate effects on people. Many governments are working with&#13;
&#13;
service providers and beneficiaries to improve public service delivery. For example, in&#13;
&#13;
Bangalore, India, a civil society group introduced report cards in 1994 rating user&#13;
&#13;
experiences with public services. The reports of poor quality and corruption were widely&#13;
&#13;
publicized, leading to improvements in service delivery and public governance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This section covers a broad range of indicators showing how effective and accountable&#13;
&#13;
government, together with energetic private initiative, produces employment opportunities&#13;
&#13;
and services that empower poor people. Its 12 tables cover three cross-cutting&#13;
&#13;
development      themes:   private  sector   development,    public   sector      policies,         and&#13;
&#13;
infrastructure, information, and telecommunications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Creating the conditions for private sector development&#13;
&#13;
Investment is the foundation of growth, and most investment comes from the private&#13;
&#13;
sector. But governments play an important role in providing a predictable environment in&#13;
&#13;
which people, ideas, and money work together productively and efficiently. This allows&#13;
&#13;
private firms operating in competitive markets to be the engines of growth and job creation,&#13;
&#13;
providing opportunities to escape poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Governments around the world are expanding opportunities for improved investment and&#13;
&#13;
business climates. State-owned enterprises are being privatized, trade barriers are being&#13;
&#13;
reduced, and improvements in regulations that enhance business activity are contributing&#13;
&#13;
to greater business opportunities and growth.&#13;

6 GLOBALLINKS&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I&#13;
  n the past 20 years the global economy has become increasingly integrated. International&#13;
&#13;
financial flows have grown. More people are on the move. And countries are exchanging&#13;
&#13;
more goods and services. In 2002 trade in goods and services as a share of world output&#13;
&#13;
reached 54 percent, up from 31 percent in 1980 (figure 6a). Several rounds of tariff&#13;
&#13;
reductions and expanding trade in services have spurred growth in trade among high-&#13;
&#13;
income economies. Developing economies' trade has recovered from a slowdown in the&#13;
&#13;
1980s. Since 1992 the share of trade in their output, measured in constant dollars, has&#13;
&#13;
been growing as fast or faster than that of the high-income economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Still, there are many obstacles to global integration. National policies that protect home&#13;
&#13;
industries from competition or subsidize their output distort patterns of trade and prevent&#13;
&#13;
developing countries from reaching their full potential. The movement of people, an&#13;
&#13;
important mode of trade in services, remains particularly restricted. Risk and uncertainty&#13;
&#13;
also inhibit the flow of finance, while development assistance may be directed more by&#13;
&#13;
political considerations than by development opportunities. Table 6.1 highlights additional&#13;
&#13;
trends in global integration.&#13;

apply just one criterion in all circumstances. For this                                                                    remain in a country for humanitarian reasons.&#13;

notes to the table for other breaks in comparability&#13;
&#13;
between countries and over time.&#13;
&#13;
  Data on the size of the foreign labor force are also&#13;
&#13;
problematic. Countries use different permit systems&#13;
&#13;
to gather information on immigrants. Some countries&#13;
&#13;
issue a single permit for residence and work, while&#13;
&#13;
others issue separate residence and work permits.&#13;
&#13;
Differences in immigration laws across countries,&#13;
&#13;
particularly with respect to immigrants' access to&#13;
&#13;
employment, greatly affect the recording and meas-&#13;

urement of migration and reduce the international&#13;

comparability of raw data. The data exclude tempo-&#13;

PRIMARY DATA DOCUMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank is not a primary data collection agency for most issues other&#13;
&#13;
than living standards surveys and debt. As a major user of socioeconomic data,&#13;
&#13;
however, the World Bank places particular emphasis on data documentation to&#13;
&#13;
inform users of data in economic analysis and policymaking. The tables in this&#13;
&#13;
section provide information on the sources, treatment, and currentness of&#13;
&#13;
the principal demographic, economic, and environmental indicators in World&#13;
&#13;
Development Indicators.&#13;
&#13;
    Differences in the methods and conventions used by the primary data&#13;
&#13;
collectors--usually national statistical agencies, central banks, and customs&#13;
&#13;
services--may give rise to significant discrepancies over time both among and&#13;
&#13;
within countries. Delays in reporting data and the use of old surveys as the base&#13;
&#13;
for current estimates may severely compromise the quality of national data.&#13;
&#13;
    Although data quality is improving in some countries, many developing coun-&#13;
&#13;
tries lack the resources to train and maintain the skilled staff and obtain the&#13;
&#13;
equipment needed to measure and report demographic, economic, and environ-&#13;
&#13;
mental trends in an accurate and timely way. The World Bank recognizes the need&#13;
&#13;
for reliable data to measure living standards, track and evaluate economic&#13;
&#13;
trends, and plan and monitor development projects. Thus, working with bilateral&#13;
&#13;
and other multilateral agencies, it continues to fund and participate in technical&#13;
&#13;
assistance projects to improve statistical organization and basic data methods,&#13;
&#13;
collection, and dissemination.&#13;
&#13;
    The World Bank is working at several levels to meet the challenge of improv-&#13;
&#13;
ing the quality of the data that it collates and disseminates. With a view to&#13;
&#13;
strengthening national capacity the Bank conducts technical assistance, training,&#13;
&#13;
and surveys at the country level in the following areas:&#13;
&#13;
·   Poverty assessments in most borrower member countries.&#13;
&#13;
·   Living standards measurement and other household and farm surveys with&#13;
&#13;
    national statistical agency partners.&#13;
&#13;
·   National accounts and inflation.&#13;
&#13;
·   Price and expenditure surveys for the International Comparison Program.&#13;
&#13;
·   Projects to improve statistics in the countries of the former Soviet Union.&#13;
&#13;
·   External debt management.&#13;
&#13;
·   Environmental and economic accounting.&#13;

     The Atlas conversion factor for any year is the average of a country's           when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large mar-&#13;

            Four years have passed since the
            Millennium Development Goals sharpened the focus on
            measuring the results of development-not the number of
            projects undertaken or the dollars spent, but the
            improvements in people's lives. The emphasis on
            quantitative targets and the requirement for monitoring
            progress on country poverty reduction strategies have
            increased the demand for statistics. And that showed us how
            deficient the statistical systems are in many parts of the
            developing world. Good statistics are not just a technical
            issue- they are a development issue, requiring concerted
            action by the entire global community. As Trevor Manuel,
            South Africa's minister of finance, has put it,
            "If you can't measure it, you can't manage
            it." That is why data, statistics, and indicators are
            at the heart of the results agenda. Governments need them.
            Politicians need them. Managers of development programs need
            them. And citizens need them-to hold governments accountable
            for their actions and their and their results. World
            Development Indicators, the World Bank's statistical
            publication, presents the most current and accurate
            information on global development on both a national level
            and aggregated globally. This information allows readers to
            monitor the progress made toward meeting the Millennium
            Development Goals, endorsed by the United Nations and its
            member countries, the World Bank, and a host of partner
            organizations in September 2001. This report contains over
            80 tables and over 800 indicators for monitoring progress
            for 152 economies and 14 country groups, as well as basic
            indicators for a further 55 economies. There are key
            indicators for the latest year available, important regional
            data, and income group analysis. The report presents
            analyses that center on six themes: World View, People,
            Environment, Economy, States and Markets, and Global Links.
            The latter theme touches such topics generally described as
            movement of goods, financial flows and aid, and the movement
            of people.
