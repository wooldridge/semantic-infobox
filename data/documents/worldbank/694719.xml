THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:             Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros&#13;
Beneficiary:          Ministry of Education&#13;
Targeted Intervention:  Yes&#13;
Credit Amount:        Interim Trust Fund Credit of SDR 5.1 million (US$ 7.0&#13;
million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:                Standard IDA terms, with 1 0-year grace period and 40 years&#13;
to maturity&#13;
Commitment Fee:       0.50% on undisbursed credit balance, beginning 60 days after&#13;
signing, less any waiver&#13;
Project Description:    The project would support investments in the first two priority&#13;
sub-sectors identified in the Government's Program for the&#13;
Reinforcement of Education and Training, namely primary&#13;
education and vocational training. To ensure effective and&#13;
timely implementation of the project, it would also support&#13;
local capacity building in the planning, execution,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of sector management.&#13;
The project would improve learning at primary level&#13;
through increased participation in quality education.&#13;
Participation would be improved through: (a) establishment&#13;
of local school committees with financial and managerial&#13;
authority on public primary schools; and (b) provision of&#13;
adequate infrastructure through improvement grants to&#13;
participating communities in targeted areas. Quality of the&#13;
teaching-learning processes would be improved through: (a)&#13;
development of better management practices to monitor&#13;
delivery  of  the  study  program;  (b)  provision  of&#13;
teaching/learning materials, both for class and individual&#13;
learning activities; (c) changes in the teaching-learning&#13;
methods used by teachers in the classroom; (d) changes in the&#13;
supervision practices to develop and monitor implementation&#13;
of effective teaching practices; and (e) support to development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Comoros: Third Education Project&#13;
of learning assessment and education information systems at&#13;
regional and central levels of the MOE.&#13;
The project would improve competencies of skilled workers&#13;
through the establishment of an autonomous, flexible and&#13;
effective demand-driven training system in which training&#13;
institutions and employers will get grants from the&#13;
Government.   The  establishment of a  performing&#13;
vocational training system would be achieved through the&#13;
creation of a small, autonomous institution -- the Office for&#13;
Vocational Training (OVT) -- managed by an independent&#13;
council.  Competencies and skills would be developed&#13;
through (a) support for management and the initial financing&#13;
of a Vocational Training Fund (VTF) which would finance&#13;
one part of the expenses of training linked to the execution of&#13;
sub-projects which respond to needs identified in the labor&#13;
market; (b) support for the development of training modules&#13;
which lead to a qualification and the training of the trainers;&#13;
and (c) support for the reorganization of existing vocational&#13;
training institutions in order to develop autonomous&#13;
management, as well as modular programs adapted to the&#13;
labor market.&#13;
The project would support the development of effective&#13;
project management capacities among staff in the Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU) and improve competencies of MOE&#13;
authorities in planning, execution, monitoring and evaluation&#13;
of the sector program.&#13;
Financing Plan:       IDA  US$7.0  million, Government US$0.3  and  Local&#13;

ISLAMIC FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF THE COMOROS&#13;
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   With GDP per capita estimated at US$460 (1996), the majority of the population&#13;
of the Comoros (504,000 in 1996) lives in relative or near-poverty. On the other hand,&#13;
the country has a favorable income distribution, with very few people at the extremes of&#13;
wealth or poverty, a functioning traditional safety net which is supported through&#13;
remittances from abroad (estimated at US$40 per year, per capita) and communities&#13;
which have demonstrated cohesiveness, interest in the development process, willingness&#13;
to pay for quality services, and ability to take responsibility for management. The 1994&#13;
Poverty Assessment I concluded that major improvements in poverty reduction had to&#13;
come through: (a) overall economic growth, with equity; and (b) improved public&#13;
services to the poor, especially primary education and primary health care.&#13;
1.2   These recommendations are fully consistent with the Government's long-term&#13;
strategy --supported by the Bank-- to accelerate growth through increasing productivity in&#13;
agriculture and developing the small-scale and informal sectors, while expanding into&#13;
new areas such as tourism, export processing and financial and other business services.&#13;
Of these areas, agricultural growth as well as small scale manufacturing and services will&#13;
benefit the poor, provided access to relevant training programs is improved. In the social&#13;
sectors, the priority is to improve the accessibility of basic services by attracting clients&#13;
through the quality and reliability of health and education. This in turn calls for a well-&#13;
balanced program of expenditures in these core sectors. This approach is in line with the&#13;
Mini-CAS (June 1995) which recommends continued assistance to macro-economic and&#13;
structural reforms initiated in the early 1990's through a proposed structural adjustment&#13;
credit, and support to sectoral operations in the Agriculture / Environment and Education&#13;
sectors.  These proposed operations would complement the on-going FY92 Road&#13;
Maintenance, the FY94 Small Enterprise Development, the FY94 Population and Human&#13;
Resources Development (PHRD) and the FY97 Pilot Agricultural Services projects.&#13;
1.3   The Government is aware that the present education system is not producing the&#13;
basic skills required for national development and the reduction of poverty. Following&#13;
the democratization process initiated in the early 1990's, the Government of the Comoros&#13;
held a National Conference in 1992, which was followed by the National Consultation on&#13;
The World Bank (September 1994). Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros - Poverty and Growth&#13;

Education (the "Etats Gen&amp;raux") in June/July 1994 2 and the preparation of a Program&#13;
for the Reinforcement of Education and Training (PRET) 3 in 1996. During negotiations,&#13;
the Goverrnent confirmed its commitment to implement the PRET, in particular the&#13;
objectives of its first five-year program (1997-2002). The program's goals are to improve&#13;
access to quality basic education and develop skills for the labor market. The underlying&#13;
strategies include targeting of programs to the poor, enhancing the relevance of education&#13;
and training, improving internal and external efficiency, and strengthening management&#13;
capacity to support these policies and measures.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT&#13;
1.4   Since independence in 1975 the country has experienced considerable economic&#13;
change in trying to adjust its economy to the external environment. Following a decade&#13;
of growth bubble generated by externally-financed infrastructure projects, real GDP&#13;
slowed significantly from an annual average of 6 percent in the early 1980's to 0.6 percent&#13;
over 1985-1995. This led to a decline in real per capita income by an annual average of&#13;
about 2 percent during the past decade, and the emergence of chronic financial problems&#13;
in the late 1980's. The decline in economic performance is a manifestation of the&#13;
country's developmental constraints, which include a narrow export base, weak&#13;
institutional capacity exacerbated by poor economic management, as well as an&#13;
unfavorable private sector environment. To address its macroeconomic imbalances and&#13;
remove some of the structural constraints to growth, the government launched an&#13;
adjustment program in 1991.&#13;
1.5   The Adjustment Program.   The adjustment program  made progress in&#13;
liberalizing imports and removing price controls on several commodities.  It also&#13;
improved the environment for private sector activity and made some progress in reducing&#13;
the fiscal burden arising from the parastatal sector. These led to major improvements in&#13;
budgetary as well as external current account deficits in 1992-93. During that period,&#13;
there was also a strong economic recovery, accounted for mainly by the improved&#13;
performance of agriculture, manufacturing and tourism.&#13;
1.6   In January 1994, the Comorian Franc (CF) was devalued by 33 percent in foreign&#13;
currency, in concert with the 50 percent devaluation that was effected by other CFA&#13;
countries. The economy's response to this devaluation was mixed. Slow down of&#13;
economic activities in trade and agriculture was responsible for a real GDP decline&#13;
averaging 2.3 percent a year in 1994-95. Tourism growth had some compensatory effect&#13;
in 1994, with tourist arrivals registering a 20 percent increase, but this was dampened by&#13;
the coup of September 1995. Exports performance for traditional commodities was poor&#13;

because of the depressed market of vanilla and cloves, even though new export products&#13;
were starting to develop. With major shortfalls in revenues and an increase in current&#13;
expenditures, the country's fiscal performance in 1994 and 1995 was weak. By end of&#13;
1995, salary arrears for civil servants accumulated up to six months -- and reached 9&#13;
months by end of 1996 -- and external arrears reached US$43 million. The inflation rate&#13;
rose by some 20 percent in 1994 but stabilized at about 7 percent in 1995. In 1996, real&#13;
GDP grew by 1 percent as tourism picked up and the private sector started to regain&#13;
confidence after the March presidential election, and the rate of inflation dripped to 3.5&#13;
percent as prices stabilized. However, public finances remain difficult.&#13;
1.7   Economic reforms in the Comoros have been complicated by the parallel efforts at&#13;
introducing political reforms. The country's political landscape has been historically&#13;
characterized by turbulence associated with attempts to reconcile modem governance&#13;
with ancestral traditions. The latest phase of political change was initiated in 1990 with&#13;
reforms aimed at bringing the country from one party rule to representative government.&#13;
A multiparty Constitution was approved by referendum in June 1992. Since that time,&#13;
however, the political situation has remained fragile, given the recent history of frequent&#13;
changes in government and several coup attempts.&#13;
1.8   Presidential and legislative elections held in March and December 1996,&#13;
respectively, represent a major landmark in the country's political transition process, and&#13;
it is anticipated that this would usher in a period of stability. New private investments are&#13;
forthcoming in the hotel expansion, fishing and manufacturing industry. The new&#13;
Government has recognized the need for the country to improve its economic&#13;
management and performance, and has started to take measures to improve budgetary&#13;
revenues and cut expenditures. The devaluation of January 1994 has brought some&#13;
improvement in the country's competitiveness, and continued membership of the&#13;
Comoros in the Franc zone will provide a degree of stability based on prudent monetary&#13;
policy. However, internal adjustment needs to be continued through compression of&#13;
public expenditures and of the real cost of services and labor. The deepening of tax&#13;
reforms is also needed to remove tax-induced distortions and strengthen government&#13;
revenue base. The new Government is preparing a second adjustment program to support&#13;
these reforms as well as consolidate the gains from the earlier adjustment efforts, and has&#13;
requested support from the Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). A&#13;
Structural Adjustment Credit and an IMF Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility&#13;
(ESAF) are being prepared for Board consideration in the first half of FY98.&#13;
C. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING&#13;
1.9   Modeled after the French system, the education and training system in the&#13;
Comoros is structured around four levels delivered in corresponding types of school.&#13;
These are: primary (grades I - 6) in primary schools; lower secondary (7 - 10) in collges;&#13;
upper secondary (11 - 13) in lyc&amp;es; and post-secondary (13 and above) in teacher,&#13;
technical and management training institutes. In addition, a large proportion of children&#13;
attend the coranic school, while modem pre-schooling is rudimentary (only 6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
kindergarten were registered in 1995) and mostly concentrated in the capital (Moroni).&#13;
Like in most African countries, the demographic structure of the population represents a&#13;
major burden on public finance with about 20 percent of the total population attending&#13;
school and growing at approximately 2,7 percent per year. Starting from a very low base&#13;
in the mid-1980's, private education witnessed a rapid expansion in recent years,&#13;
especially at secondary level.&#13;
1.10  The Government is aware that the present education system is not producing the&#13;
basic skills required for national development and the reduction of poverty. More than&#13;
one-third of school-age children do not attend formal schooling at primary level and,&#13;
among those who complete the 6-year primary cycle, only about 40 percent continue to&#13;
lower secondary schooling. In 1995-96, net enrollment ratios (the latter take out over-&#13;
and under-age children and repeaters) at primary and lower and upper secondary levels&#13;
were estimated at 55, 9 and 2 percent, respectively. Girls represented nearly 45 percent&#13;
of enrollees at each level. However, these figures mask an inequitable distribution of&#13;
services between the three islands. In 1995-96, girl's enrollment ratios were significantly&#13;
lower than those of boys in 9 of the 15 school districts, especially in Anjouan. Access to&#13;
primary education is constrained by limited space in existing classrooms. The vast&#13;
majority of the 262 public primary schools (1996) were built more than 15 years ago,&#13;
using space norms (less than 30 m2 per classroom) that are not adequate for the current&#13;
size of classes (national average of 39 pupils) and site planning which does not provide&#13;
for sanitary facilities and a minimum size courtyard. At secondary level, the capacity of&#13;
the existing public colleges (41) and lycees (9) is underutilized, mainly due to restricted&#13;
entrance at lower secondary level and recent expansion of private education, and MOE&#13;
has already started rationalizing the school map with the closing of 5 collges and I&#13;
lycees in 1994.&#13;
1.11  In addition, low internal efficiency and quality limit participation in education.&#13;
Low internal efficiency is reflected by the gap between net and gross enrollment ratios at&#13;
primary, lower and upper secondary levels, the latter estimated at 83, 26 and 15 percent,&#13;
respectively by level. A cohort analysis shows that, allowing for a maximum of three&#13;
repetitions, for 1,000 children entering Grade 1, only 174 are expected to enter the lower&#13;
secondary cycle, 87 the lower secondary cycle and 25 to pass the Grade 13 examination&#13;
(baccalaureat).   The system must provide 14 years of schooling per student who&#13;
completes the primary cycle. This situation is due in large part to the poor level of&#13;
quality of public education. During the period 1991-1994, sporadic teacher strikes have&#13;
also shortened dramatically the number of effective school days in the last four years to&#13;
less than 100 days, compared with the stated norm of 160 school days per academic year.&#13;
In 1994-95, at least 20 percent of public primary classrooms have been closed for lack of&#13;
teachers. Shortages of school materials and poor management also contributed to the&#13;
deterioration of quality. In 1993, the MOE conducted a national learning assessment at&#13;
the end of Grade 6 which concluded that pupils achieved scores in French and math were&#13;
4   Including the "Colkges Islamiques".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
generally comparable to scores that French Grade 4 students would have achieved on&#13;
similar tests -- assuming that the curricula are very similar between the two countries.&#13;
1.12  Demand for quality education is high. In reaction to deteriorating conditions in&#13;
public schools, a growing number of parents and local authorities, mostly in the largest&#13;
villages and in dynamic communities, chose private for-profit schooling. In 1995-96,&#13;
enrollments in private schools continued increasing, representing 10 percent at primary,&#13;
39 percent at lower secondary and 32 percent at upper secondary levels (compared to 4,&#13;
22 and 9 percent in 1993-94). This shows an increasing demand and willingness to pay&#13;
for private secondary education.  While this development of private schooling is&#13;
welcomed, it raises issues of equity, sustainability (e.g. if public schools resume normal&#13;
operations) and quality assurance. Moreover, during the last two years, this development&#13;
led to further deterioration of public education, especially for the poor. Teaching staff in&#13;
private schools are recruited among civil servants who retain their public position but&#13;
often neglect their obligations to public schools. The Government is moving prudently,&#13;
considering a range of policies and measures to encourage development of quality private&#13;
schooling, while at the same time improving equitable access to quality education and&#13;
improving efficiency of public provision of education services. Measures that are being&#13;
considered include: improved accreditation system for private schools, better control of&#13;
teacher assignments and presence in public schools, and cost recovery for publicly-&#13;
provided services to private schools (e.g. teacher in-service training, standardized&#13;
examinations).&#13;
1.13  Unemployment, underemployment and low productivity are features of poverty in&#13;
the Comoros as in many developing countries. In the Comoros, the main factor&#13;
perpetuating poverty across generations is the low level of education among the poor&#13;
which limits their employment and trade options as well as their mobility. In addition,&#13;
relatively high wages (in foreign country terms) and low productivity contribute to&#13;
poverty by making the Comoros uncompetitive in international markets.&#13;
1.14 The labor market in the Comoros is not well known. The last comprehensive&#13;
manpower survey was conducted in the early 1980's; it has not been updated since, thus&#13;
making it difficult to assess the changing needs of the labor market, particularly in the&#13;
areas of tourism, commerce and trade, and the informal sector. The 1991 population&#13;
census indicates that the formal sector is small with about 21,000 employees in services,&#13;
6,000 public civil servants and 1,000 employees in private manufacturing. In the&#13;
Comoros, the main factor perpetuating poverty across generations is the low level of&#13;
education among the poor which limits their employment and trade options as well as&#13;
their mobility. Employment is expected to benefit from changes enhancing the business&#13;
environment and employment creation, such as improvement in the legal system, trade&#13;
liberalization, better access to credit and better land tenure, which are supported by an&#13;
Data from the Poverty Profile confirm the existence of a positive correlation between schooling&#13;
attainment and income level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
FY94 IDA-financed Small Enterprise Development Project and the proposed FY97 Pilot&#13;
Agriculture Services Project.&#13;
1.15  The vocational training system consists of six public training institutions which&#13;
altogether have a capacity of about 1,000 students. These institutions are under the&#13;
Ministries of Education (ENTP - Ecole Nationale Technique et Professionnelle; ENAC -&#13;
Ecole Nationale d'Administration et de Comptabilite; and the CNH - Centre National&#13;
Horticole), Agriculture (ENA - Ecole Nationale d'Agriculture; ENP - Ecole Nationale&#13;
des Peches), and Health (ENS - Ecole Nationale de Sante). The latter three closed in&#13;
recent years after having trained technicians and skilled workers who were employed&#13;
mostly in government agencies. The Second Education Project assisted in the creation of&#13;
ENTP and ENAC and financed civil works, equipment and development costs. Technical&#13;
assistance was provided under the French and Belgian bilateral assistance programs.&#13;
Private provision of training started only recently and is still embryonic.  Also,&#13;
community-supported apprenticeship schemes have been initiated and are supported by&#13;
the Community Development Fund (FADC) supported under the IDA-financed PHRD&#13;
Project.&#13;
1.16  The main issues of the current vocational training system are: (a) inadequate&#13;
training programs that serve poorly the needs of the labor market; (b) the absence of&#13;
reliable information on labor market to guide decisions on training strategies and&#13;
programs; (c) poor quality of training due to low levels of qualification of instructors and&#13;
insufficient financial resources; (d) the absence of the private sector in the planning,&#13;
management and financing of training; and (e) high costs of training due to inefficient use&#13;
of resources.&#13;
1.17  Post-secondary education available in the Comoros consists of teacher training,&#13;
agriculture, a business school and the school of health sciences, which overall provide&#13;
about 400 student-places.  Two teacher training institutions (IFERE or Institut de&#13;
Formation et de Recherche en Education), one in Grande Comore and one in Anjouan&#13;
(which was refurbished and equipped under the Second Education Project) offer pre- and&#13;
in-service training to teachers at primary and lower secondary levels. A large number of&#13;
students (estimated at about 1,000 in 1995) go abroad for university studies. Given its&#13;
priorities and resource availability, the government has agreed with donors to limit the&#13;
number of scholarships abroad to those provided by donor funds.&#13;
D. FINANCING OF EDUCATION&#13;
1.18  Public financing of education in the Comoros compares favorably with Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa (SSA) countries. The share of public education expenditure in GDP&#13;
averaged 4.0 percent in the early 1990's, slightly above SSA comparable countries, and&#13;
private financing (both for- and not-for profit) accounted for an additional 25-35 percent&#13;
of public expenditure. During the period 1991-1995, GDP grew by 1.3 percent p.a. on&#13;
average while at the same time total public recurrent expenditure decreased by 6 percent&#13;
p.a. as a result of government's effort to reduce public expenditure and control the deficit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
Against this unfavorable economic situation, the share of public education expenditure&#13;
was maintained at approximately 25 percent of total government spending, reflecting the&#13;
sustained priority to the social sectors and to the education sector in particular. However,&#13;
total public expenditure in the sector in 1994 (actual) and 1995 (budgeted) fell below the&#13;
1990 level in real terms. And since the share of salaries in total education expenditure&#13;
was maintained, non-salary expenditures, especially on operating expenditure and&#13;
consumables, were hard hit. The 1996 recurrent budget for education proposed a&#13;
significant increase --12.5 percent in real terms compared to 1995-- raising the share of&#13;
education in total public expenditure to 29.1 percent (26.1 percent in 1995). A significant&#13;
part of that increase, however, was allocated to salaries to the detriment of materials and&#13;
consumables.&#13;

1.19   The Government is addressing the following issues: (a) the need to encourage&#13;
participation of parents, local communities, private enterprises and the beneficiaries in the&#13;
financing of education, especially at secondary and tertiary levels, in return for shared&#13;
responsibility between the Government and its partner, as well as greater accountability.&#13;
Specific measures include: establishment of local boards and decentralization of decisions&#13;
to the local authorities; establishment and implementation of objective criteria for&#13;
selection of students and award of fellowships at secondary and tertiary levels; and&#13;
transparent accounting and financing systems with regular audit reports; (b) the need to&#13;
increase allocations to non-salary expenditure, especially for operating expenditure to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
support functioning of schools, inspection and supervision of teachers, in-service training,&#13;
provision of teaching-learning materials and maintenance of the information system; (c)&#13;
policies and measures to improve the effectiveness of public spending on education,&#13;
including the strict application of norms regarding the number of school-days during the&#13;
academic year and the monitoring of performance at all levels of the system; and (d) the&#13;
need to appoint an additional 100 primary level teachers whose positions have been&#13;
approved in the context of the Civil Service Reform, but not yet filled, as well as recruit&#13;
additional teachers who will be needed for enrollment expansion.&#13;
1.20  Non-salary Expenditure.   To protect "vital" non-salary expenditure the&#13;
Government is envisaging fixed levels of budgetary resources to priority operations&#13;
which would be monitored closely. Starting in 1995 the MOE budgeted a block transfer&#13;
to schools for the opening of the 1995-96 academic year.  During negotiations,&#13;
agreements were reached on further measures to be introduced in 1997. These include&#13;
provision of budgetary resources to ensure: (a) a minimum of two visits of the district&#13;
Inspectorate to each primary school; (b) a minimum of 10 working days of in-service&#13;
training per year, to be organized at the school and district levels; (c) a provision of at&#13;
least 600 FC (US$1.70) per pupil, per annum, to purchase teaching-learning materials;&#13;
and (d) two school census per academic year (November and June) to monitor the&#13;
performance of the education and training system.&#13;
1.21  Salary Expenditure. Salaries represent nearly 80% of total public recurrent&#13;
expenditure on education, comparable to most developing countries around the world.&#13;
The current composition of these expenditures in the Comoros prevents further&#13;
economies and/or reallocation of expenditure within the sector (from salary to non-salary)&#13;
for two reasons. First, as a result of the Civil Service Reform initiated in 1991 under&#13;
MERCAP, the total number of staff positions in MOE has been reviewed and determined&#13;
after extensive studies and internal reorganizations. Thus, further reductions of salaries&#13;
that could be generated from streamlining or downsizing are difficult. Second, an&#13;
additional 100 teaching positions in public primary schools have remained vacant since&#13;
mid-1996. This is due to delays in implementing staff reductions in other parts of&#13;
government, which would have freed positions within the agreed upon ceiling and&#13;
allowed the MOE to recruit teachers in accordance with its approved staffing plan. Thus,&#13;
there is an urgent need to recruit additional teachers at primary level, which will increase&#13;
the share of expenditure on salary in MOE over the total government budget for salary&#13;
while at the same time complying with aggregate number of positions and total salary&#13;
bill.&#13;
1.22  Effectiveness. Of all issues in the financing of education in the Comoros, the&#13;
reduction of the wastage of public resources and poor management bears the most&#13;
promising pay-off, but is also the most difficult to address. During the period 1991-1994,&#13;
the public education system has been paralyzed by frequent strikes --called by teachers'&#13;
unions as well as by other constituencies-- with the net effect to dispense less than 60% of&#13;
the expected 160 days of schooling per academic year. This has had an immediate and&#13;
profound impact on public finance, quality of schooling, learning outcomes of students,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
morale of staff in MOE and the level of public confidence on education. Since the&#13;
Government kept paying salaries --albeit with delays from 2 to 6 months-- to civil&#13;
servants on strike, approximately 40% of the salary bill has been wasted. Moreover,&#13;
frequent, unexpected and uncontrolled strikes have left thousands of students with&#13;
disrupted instruction and an absence of follow-up. In recent years, larger number of&#13;
parents decided to send their children to private schools which multiplied rapidly in all&#13;
parts of the country, especially at secondary level and in the capital. However, as noted&#13;
above (para. 1.12), most of the new private schools recruited their teaching staff among&#13;
qualified teachers in public schools, thus preventing exertion of pressure from teachers&#13;
and parents to reach an agreement to the labor conflicts.&#13;
1.23  During the first half of 1995, the Government adopted a strong position vis-a-vis&#13;
the unions, announcing that it would not pay salaries for a two-month strike in late 1994.&#13;
That decision was reverted by the next Government in October 1995, in the wake of&#13;
presidential elections. Other promising measures were also implemented before the&#13;
September 1995 coup. They included participation of Government authorities in open&#13;
public debates (organized by a private television network established in Moroni) to raise&#13;
awareness and justify policies adopted by government. Also, representatives of teachers'&#13;
unions were invited to participate, as full members, to steering committees in charge of&#13;
preparing the 1995-96 academic year and of recruiting and training primary level&#13;
teachers. In addition, the MOE initiated discussions with representatives of the private&#13;
sector with the view to ensure that minimum requirements for public service are met by&#13;
those teachers who cumulate teaching in public and private schools.&#13;
1.24  These measures point to the need for continued dialogue with the various partners&#13;
to re-establish an ethos in the education sector. Promising strategies aim at: presenting&#13;
the Government's policies in a clear, transparent and objective manner, through the media&#13;
while at the same time inviting other partners to participate in the resolution of problems;&#13;
encouraging participation of all stakeholders in the decision-making process at the level&#13;
which is most appropriate for the resolution of the issue; setting clearly and disseminating&#13;
widely the goals and objectives of the system in operational terms that can be measured&#13;
and reported back regularly; and collecting and disseminating information on key&#13;
financial and technical performance indicators.&#13;
1.25  Parficipation, Responsibility and Accountability. One of the merits of the&#13;
extensive consultations which have taken place in the sector over the last 2 years is the&#13;
recognition of the need to change the role of govermnent from a universal and unique&#13;
provider of free education to one of partner with important, but limited resources. This is&#13;
not new in the Comoros since local communities have been traditionally actively&#13;
involved in the financing, management and operation of social services (para. 1.1).&#13;
However, over the years parents and students got accustomed to stipends for teachers&#13;
trainees and students at technical training institutions, free boarding for all students and&#13;
unlimited number of years of fellowship for tertiary level education abroad. In recent&#13;
years, measures have been implemented to cut back or eliminate these expensive and&#13;
ineffective incentives: stipends to instructor trainees have been abolished in 1994;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
boarding facilities in secondary schools have been closed gradually over the last decade;&#13;
and regulations have been introduced to limit the number of fellowships, identify priority&#13;
areas of study and instigate students to complete diligently their study program.&#13;
1.26  Other measures and actions are needed. Their aim is to encourage participation of&#13;
parents, local communities, private enterprises and the beneficiaries in the financing of&#13;
education, especially at secondary and tertiary levels where public funds will continue to&#13;
finance a large part of the costs for a limited number of individuals. Policies to promote&#13;
shared responsibility and enhanced accountability include: establishment of local boards&#13;
and decentralization of decisions to the local authorities; establishment and&#13;
implementation of objective criteria for selection of students and award of fellowships at&#13;
secondary and tertiary levels; and transparent accounting and financing systems with&#13;
regular audit reports.&#13;
E. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM FOR THE REINFORCEMENT&#13;
OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING&#13;
1.27  The production of the Program for the Reinforcement of Education and Training&#13;
(PRET) is the culmination of a process initiated by the Government in early 1994 and&#13;
supported by the Bank under the Second Education Project (closed in October 1994) and&#13;
a first advance under the Project Preparation Fund (PPF) (approved in January 1995),&#13;
with complementary financing from a Japan PHRD Grant approved in June 1994. This&#13;
process involved direct participation of about 200 representatives from Government,&#13;
regional and local authorities, villages' notability (notables), parents, teachers and&#13;
students, public and private enterprises, and national consultants. In addition, the MOE&#13;
commissioned 11 studies conducted by more than 30 local consultants with assistance&#13;
from 4 international consultants.&#13;
1.28  The Program presents a long term vision of the directions of change, and the&#13;
investment priorities in the first phase (1997-2002) of a development program that spans&#13;
over two decades (to the horizon 2015). The overall goal is in harmony with the&#13;
development objectives of the Comoros: to improve the quality of life of the Comorians&#13;
at the same time as giving priority to economic growth and to an equitable distribution of&#13;
basic social services. This is to be achieved through closer and more cost-effective&#13;
collaboration between schools and communities, as well as between training institutions&#13;
and the labor market. During the first five-year period, priority would be given to&#13;
improving access to quality basic education, developing a performing manpower training&#13;
system and strengthening managerial capacity to lead, monitor, evaluate and sustain&#13;
measures and actions outlined in the program. During the same period, low cost priority&#13;
investments would be made to improve quality and efficiency of secondary, tertiary and&#13;
pre-schooling education.&#13;
1.29  The program rests on two complementary strategies. First, the aim is to improve&#13;
learning outcomes of students in their immediate environment, namely the classroom and&#13;
the school they attend. Second, the aim is to empower village communities in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
management of schools and those involved in economic activities in the design,&#13;
implementation and evaluation of priority initiatives in training.&#13;
1.30  The choice of these strategies draws on economic, institutional and political&#13;
analyses. In the economic plan, the priority sectors of basic education and manpower&#13;
training are informed by analyses of the viability and of externalities which demonstrate&#13;
their impact on improving the quality of life, especially for the poor. In the institutional&#13;
plan, recent studies undertaken by MOE indicate the need, on the one hand, to lighten and&#13;
to recenter the role of the federal state institutions and, on the other hand, to empower the&#13;
primary beneficiaries (youth, their families, the village and employers) by means of&#13;
contracts involving partnership and productivity. Finally, in the political plan, the&#13;
strategy rests upon the principle of participation of local communities in education, which&#13;
was enunciated as a consequence of the Etats Ggneraux of education and embodied in the&#13;
PRET.&#13;
1.31  The PRET has been defined by the principal partners of the State: the Ministry of&#13;
Education, the Ministries of Finance and of Planning, of Agriculture and of Production,&#13;
as well as the Chamber of Commerce, economic and social partners, and employers. The&#13;
major orientations of the program have equally formed the basis of consultations within&#13;
Government and with international agencies such as UNDP, UNICEF, UNESCO,&#13;
ISESCO, the French Cooperation, the European Union and CIDA.&#13;
1.32  The current version of the financial plan estimates that priority investments for the&#13;
initial five-year period (1997-2002) total FC 12.0 billion (or US$34.0 million), including&#13;
FC 3.5 billion from Government, FC 1.0 billion from local communities and FC 7.5&#13;
billion (or US$21 million) from the donor community. The share of investments by sub-&#13;
sector would be aligned on the priorities, with primary education receiving more than&#13;
60%, vocational training 12-15%, institutional strengthening 10-12%, and secondary and&#13;
tertiary education about 7-8% each. Although there has not yet been firm commitments&#13;
by donors, an estimated FC 5.6 billion (or US$16.0 million) could be made available in&#13;
the short- to medium-term. The last of a series of informal meetings took place in March&#13;
1997 with the participation of representatives from donors present in the Comoros,&#13;
namely: UNDP, UNICEF, ISESCO, the European Union, the French Cooperation, China,&#13;
India, the Islamic League and the African Muslim Agency. To secure appropriate levels&#13;
of financing for its Program the Government plans to organize donor consultations in&#13;
June 1997.&#13;
F. IDA ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
1.33  Since the early 1990's, IDA's assistance strategy for education has been to&#13;
promote Government ownership and development of sectoral strategies. As part of these&#13;
efforts, the FY87 Second Education Project funded investments in primary, secondary&#13;
and technical education that aimed at strengthening the human and managerial capacity of&#13;
the Ministry of Education (MOE) and providing materials to schools. In the footsteps of&#13;
studies financed under the project and with further assistance from a Japan PHRD Grant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
administered by the Bank, the Government organized Etats GenJraux in June/July 1994&#13;
with a view to update its strategy in the sector (para. 1.27) and MOE prepared a Program&#13;
for the Reinforcement of Education and Training in March 1996 (para. 1.28).&#13;
G. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.34 Lessons learned from the recently completed Second Education Project include&#13;
the need to: (a) base project design on government's own strategy in the sector; (b)&#13;
establish realistic and substantively agreed targets with shareholders; (c) develop an&#13;
overall financing plan for the sector, including projected sectoral recurrent costs and&#13;
government counterpart funding of specific program activities; (d) design programs with&#13;
a view to involve all technical ministries and agencies in unison with national&#13;
government initiatives on public service reform, rationalization of the fiscal situation and&#13;
improvement of public management; (e) clearly define technical assistance needs; and (f)&#13;
coordinate all aid projects by the MOE, preferably by a single unit. These lessons have&#13;
been incorporated in the design of the proposed project.&#13;
H. DONOR ASSISTANCE IN THE SECTOR&#13;
1.35 The Government is firmly committed to associate representatives of the donor&#13;
community in the process of preparation of projects and sub-projects to support&#13;
implementation of the proposed program. Specifically, participation was sought from&#13;
UNDP, UNESCO, UNICEF, ISESCO, the European Union and the French Cooperation&#13;
who have already expressed their interest to finance preparatory work and/or to&#13;
participate in the financing of the proposed program. At the invitation of Government,&#13;
three specialists from UNESCO, the Resident Representative of UNICEF, one specialist&#13;
from ISESCO, and a team of French Cooperants Techniques joined workshops on quality&#13;
of education and/or committees in charge of the preparation of detailed projects and sub-&#13;
projects under each of the six programs (including the three priority) defined in the PRET&#13;
(para. 1.28).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT&#13;
2.1   The project would support investments in the first two priority sub-sectors&#13;
identified in the PRET, namely primary education and vocational training. To ensure&#13;
effective and timely implementation of the project, it would also support local capacity&#13;
building in the planning, execution, monitoring and evaluation of project-financed&#13;
activities. During Appraisal, agreement was reached on the PRET, including its major&#13;
goals, objectives, priorities, strategies and action plans.  During Negotiations, an&#13;
agreement was reached on a Letter of Development Policy for the sector.&#13;
First Objective: Improve Primary Education&#13;
2.2   The project would improve learning at primary level through increased&#13;
participation in quality education.&#13;
(a)   Participation would be improved through: (i) establishment of local&#13;
School Committees with financial and managerial authority on public&#13;
primary schools; and (ii) provision of adequate infrastructure, including&#13;
classrooms, fresh water and latrines, and storage facilities for educational&#13;
materials.&#13;
(b)   Quality of the teaching-learning processes would be improved through: (i)&#13;
development of better management practices to monitor delivery of the&#13;
study program; (ii) provision of teaching/learning materials in sufficient&#13;
quantities, both for class and individual learning activities; (iii) changes in&#13;
the teaching-learning methods used by teachers in the classroom; (iv)&#13;
changes in the supervision practices to develop and monitor&#13;
implementation of effective teaching practices; and (v) support to&#13;
development of learning assessment and education information systems at&#13;
regional and central levels of the MOE.&#13;
2.3   As a result of the project, learning in primary education would improve in the&#13;
following areas: reading, writing and speaking of French and Arabic; basic math&#13;
operations; application of basic skills in real life situation; and social behavior (hygiene&#13;
and civics). Annex 1 provides a summary description of the end-of-cycle profile&#13;
describing expected learning outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
Second Objective: Improve Skilled Labor Training&#13;
2.4   The project would improve competencies of skilled workers through the&#13;
establishment of an autonomous, flexible and effective demand-driven training system.&#13;
(a)   The establishment of a performing vocational training system would&#13;
be achieved through the creation of a small, autonomous institution -- the&#13;
Office for Vocational Training (OVT) -- managed by an independent&#13;
board.&#13;
(b)   Competencies and skills would be developed through (i) support for&#13;
management and the initial financing of a Vocational Training Fund&#13;
(VTF) which would finance one part of the expenses of training linked to&#13;
the execution of sub-projects which respond to needs identified in the&#13;
labor market; (ii) support for the development of training modules which&#13;
lead to a qualification and the training of the trainers; and (iii) support for&#13;
the reorganization of existing vocational training institutions in order to&#13;
develop autonomous management, as well as modular programs adapted&#13;
to the labor market.&#13;
2.5   As a result of the project, apprentices and workers would improve their&#13;
qualifications and increase their productivity in the workplace. This would be achieved&#13;
through the establishment of a competitive, demand-driven system based on sub-projects&#13;
designed jointly between employers and trainers, delivered through short ad hoc modular&#13;
programs, and using existing training facilities available in the Comoros or the region.&#13;
Third Objective: Develop Effective Project Management&#13;
2.6   The project would support the development of effective project management&#13;
capacities among staff in the Project Management Unit (PMU) and improve&#13;
competencies of local authorities in planning, execution, monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
project-financed activities. Throughout the execution of the project, staff in the PMU at&#13;
central and regional levels, as well as local leaders of initiatives implemented under the&#13;
project would be exposed to, and use, a variety of techniques and tools in needs analysis,&#13;
problem-solving, communications, planning and programming, basic accounting, and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation activities.&#13;
B DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Objective 1: Improve Primary Education (estimated cost of US$4.5 million, or 65%&#13;
of total base cost)&#13;
2.7   To improve learning through increased participation in quality education, the&#13;
Government has identified priority outcome areas at the completion of the primary cycle&#13;
and the improvements in the priority factors which influence learning in French, math and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
social/civic behavior. These are detailed in Annex 1 and summarized in Chart 2.1 below.&#13;
To improve participation, the Government has identified two priority areas that the&#13;
project will support: community participation and improved infrastructure. To improve&#13;
quality, it has identified five priority areas: management of schools, teaching-learning&#13;
materials,  teaching  methods,  supervision  and  learning  assessment.    A   better&#13;
understanding of the interaction between these factors is being developed through pilot&#13;
projects initiated in June 1996 in two public primary schools located in underserved&#13;
areas, one in Anjouan and one in Moheli.&#13;

Component 1.1: Improved Participation in Primary Education&#13;
2.8    Community  Participation.   The  Comoros have a long  history  of active&#13;
community participation in the provision of social and humanitarian services.&#13;
Experiences gained through implementation of the FY93 Population and Human&#13;
Resources Development Project show a great potential which remains largely&#13;
unexploited. In the health sector, community participation extends to management and&#13;
governance of village health centers. Residents elect representatives to local or sub-&#13;
district Boards of Governors which have been made responsible for the management of&#13;
subsidies transferred from the Treasury and funds collected at local level. The experience&#13;
has been generally satisfactory. However, delays in transfers of budgetary resources from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
the Treasury to the local Boards, compounded with arrears in the payment of salaries to&#13;
civil servants, have mitigated the encouraging results achieved on the institutional front.&#13;
2.9   The Ministry of Education is firmly committed to extending a similar approach to&#13;
the education sector. This decision is endorsed by a large segment of community leaders&#13;
who participated in the regional and national consultations (the Etats Generaux de&#13;
l'education). The center piece of the strategy is to delegate authority and responsibility to&#13;
School Committees (Conseils d 'icole) which would comprise a majority of&#13;
representatives from the community and parents.&#13;
2.10  The project would assist in establishing School Committees and supporting their&#13;
development in schools located in the poorest areas of the Comoros. The School&#13;
Committees would be involved in three areas of responsibility: construction and&#13;
maintenance of the infrastructure; textbooks; and operating funds. With assistance from&#13;
the MOE project implementation team, the School Committees would prepare and submit&#13;
school projects (Projets d'cole) to MOE for construction and/or rehabilitation of their&#13;
school. At the completion of works, the School Committee would be responsible for&#13;
maintaining these facilities. Also, they would collect and administer user's fees for&#13;
textbooks distributed at the school level, as well as an annual budget for school-related&#13;
activities (excluding staff salaries and direct transfers to the schools) financed in part by&#13;
MOE and by the community.  Details of their specific functions and expected&#13;
contributions are being worked out in the course of a pilot phase during academic year&#13;
1996-97, through participative workshops involving leaders of existing community&#13;
groups, local and international NGOs, teachers and School Heads, and staff in MOE.&#13;
During appraisal, agreement was reached on an action program for the establishment of&#13;
School Committees, including the production of a standard legal document, the definition&#13;
of their mission, composition, roles and responsibilities, and the establishment of such&#13;
Committees on an experimental basis. During negotiations, a Manual of Procedures was&#13;
reviewed and agreed upon.&#13;
2.11   The project would finance specialist services, equipment, materials and&#13;
development costs needed for the production of training materials, development of&#13;
management tools and familiarization of representatives to their use, networking of&#13;
committees to share experiences, and monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of&#13;
these School Committees.&#13;
2.12  Improved Infrastructure.- The existing school infrastructure is neither capable&#13;
nor adequate to accommodate existing enrollment at primary level. The vast majority of&#13;
the existing 262 public primary schools (1995) were built more than 15 years ago, using&#13;
space norms (less than 30 m- per classroom) that are not adequate for the current size of&#13;
classes (national average of 39 pupils) and site planning which does not provide for&#13;
sanitary facilities and a minimum size courtyard. Moreover, maintenance has been&#13;
neglected for lack of funds and poor management. Of the existing 1,119 classrooms, a&#13;
survey (April 1995) found that more than half require major repairs of the roof (37%),&#13;
doors and windows (51%), walls and floor (22%). Furniture is also in short supply and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
storage capacity inadequate. The survey found that in addition to the existing 12,280&#13;
benches, another 12,600 were needed in existing public schools to accommodate the&#13;
student population.&#13;
2.13  The Government's strategy is to assist local communities in providing adequate&#13;
infrastructure through financial participation in the construction and furnishing of&#13;
classrooms.   Recent experiences conducted under the FADC  demonstrate that&#13;
communities contribute between 15-25 percent of total costs of construction and provide&#13;
regular maintenance of buildings. Local contributions would include provision of an&#13;
adequate site, provision of basic inputs (rock, gravel, wood, etc.), payment of salaries to&#13;
locally-appointed workers, and supplies for regular maintenance.&#13;
2.14  The project would finance construction / rehabilitation, furnishing and equipping&#13;
of about 220 classrooms located in the poorest areas of the three islands. These areas are&#13;
characterized by lower-than-average enrollment ratios (especially for girls), difficult&#13;
access to school (mostly hilly areas), and acute poverty. At the completion of the project,&#13;
220 classrooms would have been refurbished or constructed in about 120 schools,&#13;
providing an additional 3,600 student-places to accommodate increased participation. By&#13;
2002, net enrollment rates of boys and girls are expected to reach 78% and 69%,&#13;
respectively, compared to 61% and 50% in 1995.&#13;
Component 1.2: Improved Quality of Primary Education&#13;
2.15  Better management practices. At the school level, management is seen as a&#13;
perfunctory function, consisting mainly in transmitting orders and requests from distant&#13;
offices to staff and students in the school.  Except for a short period following&#13;
Independence during which local authorities gained power and were made accountable to&#13;
parents, the management and monitoring of staff and the supervisory functions related to&#13;
educational programs and teaching-learning processes have been under the control of&#13;
inspectors, pedagogical advisors and administrative staff in the Regional Offices, officials&#13;
in MOE and political leaders. Selection and appointment of School Heads have been&#13;
traditionally made by political authorities in MOE, which explains the high turn-over rate&#13;
in recent years.&#13;
2.16  As part of the strategy to improve quality of primary schooling, MOE recognizes&#13;
the central role of the School Head as a manager and a catalyst in the change process to&#13;
improve learning. In this new approach, the School Head is expected to: (a) assist and&#13;
guide the School Committee; (b) plan school activities and monitor their implementation;&#13;
(c) promote participation to primary schooling in the community by encouraging parents&#13;
to send their children to school; (d) monitor attendance of students and staff; (e) provide&#13;
professional support to teachers, particularly in preparing detailed lesson plans,&#13;
monitoring progress along the program of instruction, helping teachers to cope with&#13;
difficult situations, and coordinating professional development activities; and (f) organize&#13;
and maintain school records.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
2.17  The project would support the introduction of measures to professionalize the&#13;
recruitment, selection and development of School Heads, and would fund in-service&#13;
training programs and development costs for the introduction and maintenance of basic&#13;
management tools at the school level. These tools would include, inter alia: (a) monthly&#13;
timetable of school activities; (b) attendance registers for staff and students; (c) student&#13;
records (personal and academic); (d) accounts for the school-managed budget; (e)&#13;
inventory of furniture, equipment and teaching-learning materials; (f) reports from the&#13;
School Committee meetings, staff meetings, Inspector's visits and development activities&#13;
for teaching staff (journees pedagogiques); and (g) a set of administrative circulars.&#13;
2.18  The project would finance specialist services, equipment, materials and&#13;
development costs needed for the production of training materials, development of&#13;
management tools, training of School Heads in their use, and monitoring and evaluation&#13;
of the performance of School Heads.&#13;
2.19 Teaching-Learning Materials. In the 1980's the MOE decided to produce&#13;
textbooks in the country. Although heavy investments were made with international&#13;
assistance, a smaller than expected number of manuscripts were ready by the early 1990's&#13;
and did not meet expected standards. In 1992, the Government decided to purchase&#13;
textbooks readily available on the market and launched an international competitive&#13;
bidding process to provide textbooks in the core subjects (French, math and&#13;
geography/social sciences) at the primary and lower secondary levels. With financial&#13;
assistance under the Second Education Project (US$1.5 million), MOE procured 196,675&#13;
textbooks and teachers' guides which were distributed to all public primary schools in the&#13;
country by end of 1994. In 1995, MOE started a cost-recovery policy aimed at financing&#13;
the replacement cost of these textbooks. Lessons learned from experience point to the&#13;
critical importance of associating local communities in the decision-making process and&#13;
management of textbooks at the school level, and the need for training teachers to the use&#13;
of these materials.&#13;
2.20  Availability and quality of other teaching-learning materials are uneven. A very&#13;
small number of local communities have set up a modest library on their own funds.&#13;
Children attending public schools have no access to supplementary reading materials,&#13;
reference books, posters and charts. Schools have no printing or duplicating equipment,&#13;
and classroom equipment is minimal or absent. Budgetary problems have also reduced&#13;
public resources available for consumables (chalk, notebooks, paper).&#13;
2.21   The project would support the provision of an initial set of basic teaching-learning&#13;
materials, equipment for printing and duplicating documents locally, in-service training&#13;
of teachers in the use of these materials, training of local officials in the management of&#13;
textbooks at the school level, and development costs for these training programs. School&#13;
Committees would be expected to participate in the financing and to be accountable for&#13;
the distribution and use of these materials. Teaching-learning materials would include,&#13;
inter alia: (a) one textbook per pupil in basic subjects (French, math, social studies); (b)&#13;
one teacher guide per subject and per grade; (c) a small collection of reference materials&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
in each school (e.g. dictionary, maps, etc.); (d) school implements which would be shared&#13;
at the school level (e.g. compass, square, scissors, etc.); (e) sports equipment (football&#13;
and volleyball); and (f) gardening equipment.&#13;
2.22   The project would finance teaching-learning materials, equipment, specialist&#13;
services and development costs needed for the production of training materials, training&#13;
of teaching staff and members of the School Committees, and monitoring and evaluation&#13;
of the use and impact of these inputs on learning.&#13;
2.23   Teaching-learning Methods. Anecdotal evidence 6 suggests that teachers use a&#13;
limited number of group learning activities, do not use teachers' guides efficiently, and&#13;
rarely assign homework to pupils. Teachers tend to replicate the teaching methods that&#13;
they have observed when they were themselves students at primary and secondary level&#13;
or during pre-service teacher training. Since the early 1980's, the curriculum emphasizes&#13;
child-centered and discovery approaches in the teaching-learning process.   Some&#13;
approaches have been incorporated in pre-service training programs and in-service&#13;
activities aimed at upgrading the qualification of teachers, but there is no systematic&#13;
follow-up in real classroom  situations.   Teachers are expected to participate in&#13;
professional development activities organized during the school year (journees&#13;
p&amp;dagogiques). However, between 1991 and 1994, frequent strikes and interruptions&#13;
have limited the effectiveness of these activities.&#13;
2.24   Teachers and administrators in the Comoros, like in many other countries, are&#13;
generally reluctant to change existing practices. However, there was a general consensus&#13;
during the Etats Generaux on the urgent need to enhance the quality of teaching through&#13;
a diversification of the repertoire of individualized and group learning activities, as well&#13;
as the development of continuous assessment techniques and complementary remediation&#13;
activities. Specifically, teachers are expected --and recognize the need-- to use problem&#13;
solving approaches, peer group learning and learning-how-to-learn approaches. Also,&#13;
teachers are expected to use more efficiently teaching-learning materials to prepare&#13;
lessons and class activities, and to enrich the learning experience of pupils through&#13;
homework and immediate feedback to pupils.&#13;
2.25   The project would support teacher development activities aimed at using a wider&#13;
range of effective teaching-learning methods in the classroom; preparing and conducting&#13;
lessons; managing time in the classroom; assigning and marking homework; and&#13;
monitoring pupils achievement. These activities would be conducted by Inspectors and&#13;
Conseillers Pedagogiques in the CIPR, in close collaboration with staff from the IFERE.&#13;
At the end of the project, more than 75% of teachers in project-area schools would use a&#13;
The 1993 evaluation of learning outcomes (tvaluation de l'efficicacite du systeme educatif) provides&#13;
some indications on the impact of selected factors in the child environment (e.g. homework, access to&#13;
a library) on achievement. Also, in the context of the preparation of the project, participants in&#13;
workshops on factors determining the quality of primary education stressed the importance of&#13;
adopting a variety of individualized and group learning activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
variety of teaching-learning methods in the classroom; all teachers would use their&#13;
teachers' guides effectively; and all teachers would assign homework to pupils with&#13;
emphasis on enrichment and remediation.&#13;
2.26 The project would finance the development, delivery, monitoring and evaluation&#13;
of in-service training activities for teachers in the project-area schools, as well as&#13;
materials, equipment, specialist services and development costs needed for the production&#13;
of these materials and reports.&#13;
2.27  Supervision Practices. Less than 5% of public primary schools are visited&#13;
regularly by Inspectors and pedagogical advisors (conseillers pedagogiques).&#13;
Consequently, teachers' and School Heads' performance is not assessed and discussed&#13;
with the view to overcome weaknesses and improve effectiveness of the teaching process.&#13;
Traditionally, Inspectors have focused mostly on administrative regulations and norms,&#13;
thus neglecting instructional leadership. As mentioned above (para. 2.15), the role of&#13;
School Heads has been restricted to perfunctory functions.&#13;
2.28  In the course of the MOE restructuring in 1993, 15 inspection districts (CIPR -&#13;
Circonscription d'Inspection Pedagogique Regionale) were established. In 1994, staff&#13;
were appointed (15 Inspectors and 30 advisors), facilities rehabilitated (7 financed under&#13;
the Second Education Project) and equipment and materials distributed. A CIPR attends&#13;
an average of 17 public primary schools located within a maximum distance of 20-30&#13;
kilometers. In close collaboration with the regional research and training institutes&#13;
(IFERE - Institut de Formation des Enseignants et de Recherche en Education), the&#13;
CIPRs initiated in-service training activities. Conditions that constrain improvement&#13;
include inadequate management of existing resources, lack of operational skills in&#13;
pedagogy, constant tension between professional duties and administrative matters, and&#13;
the lack of necessary resources required for efficient operations. In 1995-96, with support&#13;
from the French Cooperation, about 400 teachers were inspected, and reports prepared&#13;
and transmitted to MOE. Based on that successful experience, an annual program of&#13;
inspection was prepared for 1996-97, and is being carried out.&#13;
2.29 Staff in MOE recognize the importance of supervision to improve learning and the&#13;
need to enhance the effectiveness of the CIPR, especially in the areas of in-service&#13;
training, instructional leadership and improvement of management and pedagogical&#13;
practices. To provide the engine for quality improvement, the PRET stresses the need to&#13;
reorganize supervisory mechanisms with the view to support school-based reforms which&#13;
would lead to improvements in learning achievement. Under this new approach,&#13;
supervision of School Heads would be the responsibility of Inspectors in the CIPRs and&#13;
in-service personnel in IFERE in order to increase the frequency and intensity of school&#13;
visits. Simultaneously, supervision of teachers and coordination of in-service training&#13;
activities would be the responsibility of School Heads who, in turn, would be accountable&#13;
for children's learning in the school.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
2.30   Complementary to the enhancement of supervision function at the school level by&#13;
the School Head (paras. 2.16 and 2.29), the project would assist in improving school&#13;
inspection services at the school and district levels. These services would include: (a)&#13;
two visits per year to each school; (b) one annual performance assessment of School&#13;
Heads and teachers by the Inspector; (c) guidance and leadership in the design of&#13;
professional development activities in close collaboration with the School Heads, with&#13;
the view to link them to the curriculum and the daily work of teachers; and (d)&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of school-based training activities, and monitoring of the&#13;
feedback at the school and classroom levels. These activities would form part of the&#13;
contracts to be negotiated and signed between School Committees and MOE's regional&#13;
offices (paras. 2.10 and 2.11).&#13;
2.31   The  project would  finance  equipment, materials, specialist services  and&#13;
development costs needed for the production of training materials, training of supervisory&#13;
staff, and monitoring and evaluation of the impact of supervision on learning.&#13;
2.32   Learning Assessment and Education Information Systems. In 1993, the MOE&#13;
conducted a national learning assessment at the end of Grade 6 with the assistance of the&#13;
French Cooperation 7.  The detailed results have been used in the updating of the&#13;
curriculum in 1994-95. The MOE plans to undertake bi-annual assessments starting in&#13;
1998.  Also, starting in 1992 with assistance from the French Cooperation and IDA,&#13;
MOE developed an education information system. The initial steps which have been&#13;
implemented successfully include: census of teaching and administrative staff and&#13;
development of a data base on personnel employed by the Ministry; a comprehensive&#13;
school map which includes a map for the location of each public school, a detailed&#13;
inventory of facilities (public and private), and surveys on the physical conditions of&#13;
infrastructure, equipment and materials; enrollment statistics in both public and private&#13;
schools in the country; and a set of norms which formed the basis for administrative&#13;
decisions on allocation of staff, closing and/or consolidation of existing schools and&#13;
provision of materials.&#13;
2.33   Under the PRET, these encouraging developments need to be extended with the&#13;
view to enhance institutional capacity in planning, monitoring, evaluating and informing&#13;
decisions in the key areas of learning assessment and effective use of public resources.&#13;
The project would support: (a) two national learning assessments at Grade 6 (1998 and&#13;
2000); (b) implementation of a school map process which would guide regional and local&#13;
authorities in planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating investments and school&#13;
The main conclusions are: Comorian pupils in Grade 6 achieve scores in French and math that are&#13;
generally comparable to scores that Grade 4 students in France would have achieved on similar tests -&#13;
-assuming that the curriculum are very similar between the two countries. In French, the major&#13;
weaknesses were observed in the space representation, reading of sentences and writing of short&#13;
stories. Also, results in spelling are lower than expected when the test questions are formulated&#13;
differently than in the teaching situation. In math, results are weak in geometry, measurement and&#13;
problem solving exercises. On the other hand, achievements are better than expected in activities&#13;
requiring application of a technique or use of a formula.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
operation; and (c) production of annual performance monitoring reports (tableau de&#13;
pilotage).&#13;
2.34  The project would  finance equipment, materials, specialist services and&#13;
development costs needed for the bi-annual learning assessments, production of reports,&#13;
staff training, development of systems and procedures. and monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
the impact of these inputs on institutional capacity.&#13;
Objective 2: Improve Skilled Labor Training (estimated cost of US$1.0 million, or&#13;
14% of total base cost)&#13;
Component 2.1: Establish a Performing Vocational Training System&#13;
2.35   To address the issues facing training, the Government plans to launch a reform of&#13;
the vocational training system in line with the goals identified during the Etats Gen&amp;raux&#13;
and in the PRET. The objective of the reform is to establish a cost-effective system to&#13;
develop the skills and qualifications needed for the labor market, including the informal&#13;
sector. The proposed system would be characterized by: (a) a light structure, with&#13;
administrative and financial autonomy; (b) an independent management under a Board of&#13;
Directors comprising representatives of the private (for the majority of seats) and public&#13;
sectors; (c) financed jointly by the public and private sector. At the end of the project, the&#13;
private sector is expected to finance 100% of the demand-driven training programs, while&#13;
the Government, with financial participation from communities and trainees, is expected&#13;
to finance modular training programs to youth and for the informal sector, particularly in&#13;
agriculture; and (d) accountable for its results through annual external audits.&#13;
2.36  The proposal for a new vocational training system was designed and agreed upon&#13;
between representatives of the Government, the Chamber of Commerce, the private&#13;
sector, and the civil society. Chart 2.2 below shows the institutional arrangements of the&#13;
proposed system. Its main functions would be to:&#13;
(a)   assess training needs and plan the evolution of the system according to&#13;
demonstrated needs;&#13;
(b)   organize and implement demand-driven training sub-projects aimed at&#13;
providing skills through modular instruction designed in close&#13;
collaboration with employers and in line with job requirements;&#13;
(c)   offer development opportunities to the informal sector through tailor-made&#13;
modular programs adapted to the conditions of the sector;&#13;
(d)   offer the youth opportunities to access skills training and to enter the labor&#13;
market;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
(e)   prepare modular training programs and train instructors for efficient&#13;
delivery; and&#13;
(f)   coordinate the development of existing training institutions which would&#13;
be reorganized to deliver the training programs described above. Financial&#13;
and administrative autonomy would be granted to these institutions.&#13;

based programs&#13;
2.37 The Office of Vocational Training (OVT) would be under the responsibility of the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education, and managed by an independent&#13;
Board (Conseil d'Administration) with representatives from employers, the Chamber of&#13;
Commerce and the Ministries of Finance, Planning, Education and Employment.&#13;
Representatives of the private sector would be designated by employers' associations,&#13;
labor unions and the Chamber of Commerce, as well as from voluntary associations&#13;
(NGOs, village committees, etc.). The President of the OVT would be a Board member&#13;
elected among its members.&#13;
2.38  The OVT would be managed by a Director, assisted by an administrative officer.&#13;
The Director would be responsible for implementation of policies and programs approved&#13;
by the Board. Also, the Director would coordinate activities of the two administrative&#13;
units under its authority, namely the Vocational Training Fund and the Program&#13;
Development and Instructor Training Unit. During negotiations, agreement was reached&#13;
on an action program for the establishment of the Office for Vocational Training,&#13;
including the production of its legal documents, the definition of its mission and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
objectives, the composition of its Board and the recruitment of its members, and the&#13;
appointment of its Director.&#13;
2.39  The project would support the creation of the Office of Vocational Training&#13;
(OVT). The project would finance rehabilitation of facilities to house the OVT, office&#13;
equipment, materials, specialist services and development costs for the establishment of&#13;
the Office, the development of management systems and procedures, the conduct of a&#13;
study on the financing of vocational training, the production of its reports, and the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of the new vocational training system.&#13;
Component 2.2: Develop Competencies for Skilled Labor&#13;
2.40  To develop competencies and skills needed by the labor market in the Comoros,&#13;
the Office would promote a three-prong strategy consisting of: (a) implementation of a&#13;
demand-driven training system that can respond quickly and effectively to employer's&#13;
needs and market signals for qualified workers. This would be achieved through the&#13;
establishment of a Vocational Training Fund; (b) development of capacities to design&#13;
modular training programs in close collaboration with employers and to train instructors.&#13;
This would be achieved through the creation of a Program Development and Instructor&#13;
Training Unit in the OVT; and (c) changes in the statute, financing, management and&#13;
incentive systems of the existing training institutions. This would be achieved through a&#13;
reorganization of existing centers with a view to develop autonomous management as&#13;
well as modular programs adapted to the labor market.&#13;
2.41  Vocational Training Fund. The project would establish a Vocational Training&#13;
Fund (VTF) and make an initial contribution to its funding equivalent to US$400,000.&#13;
The Fund would address specific financial and quality issues related to reorienting the&#13;
training system to a demand-driven system. It would encourage public and private&#13;
institutions to provide relevant (e.g. market- and skill-driven) training to both the formal&#13;
and informal sectors on a competitive basis.  Similar approaches have been used&#13;
effectively to promote market and employer incentives to develop and upgrade worker&#13;
skills and production technology in other countries, notably in the Philippines, Singapore,&#13;
Kenya and Madagascar.&#13;
2.42  This component would be gender sensitive in several ways: training sub-projects&#13;
would be flexible and make provision for increasing women's productivity and revenues.&#13;
Particular attention would be paid to women's access to skills training and technology&#13;
suitable for upgrading their enterprises or cooperatives, or for bringing them to the sector.&#13;
For instance, depending on the sector, between 20 to 50 percent of entry-level skill&#13;
training would be targeted to women's entry in the sector and disadvantaged groups. In&#13;
order to sensitize female students to enter non-traditional technical fields of productive&#13;
work, this component would support outreach efforts and inclusion of gender awareness&#13;
in leadership and entrepreneurship training, and training materials development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
2.43  The VTF would be managed by the Director of OVT, under the authority of the&#13;
OVT Board. Training sub-projects would be executed by public and private institutions&#13;
which would compete for Fund resources under pre-defined qualification and selection&#13;
criteria.&#13;
2.44 The VTF would support the financing of a demand-driven training contract&#13;
scheme to approved public and private sector training providers on a competitive basis.&#13;
Sub-projects would be eligible for funding which: respond to relevant skill requirements,&#13;
both technical and management; are gender-sensitive; and are targeted to the poor. The&#13;
upgrading of the training capability of contractors, such as training of trainers, could also&#13;
be included in a training contract. Employers who provide on-site skill training would be&#13;
eligible to a reimbursement of up to 100 percent (within approved ceilings) for upgrading&#13;
training equipment related to skills upgrading and technology development. The contract&#13;
scheme aims to award up to 50 training contracts for various courses and services on a&#13;
competitive basis. An average of 12 sub-projects are expected to be submitted to the&#13;
Fund annually, ranging from community-based initial training for apprentices to&#13;
enterprise-based skill upgrading and advanced tailor-made courses. Training groups&#13;
would comprise 12-18 trainees each. An estimated total of 800 entrepreneurs and&#13;
employees are expected to benefit from contract training.&#13;
2.45  As a partial cost recovery strategy, beneficiaries are expected to pay minimal&#13;
training fees, similar to those currently charged by the National Horticulture Center&#13;
(Centre National Horticole) or the community-based apprentice scheme. Once the&#13;
training scheme has proven itself, flexible but competitive fee paying arrangements&#13;
would be worked out between the Chamber of Commerce, voluntary associations (for- or&#13;
not-for-profit) and the training institutions.  Contracts would specify the financial&#13;
contribution of each party (the employer, beneficiaries, the training institution and the&#13;
Fund), and reimbursement would be justified on the number of trainees trained.&#13;
However, cumulative financing for any given enterprise or institution would be possible&#13;
within reasonable limits of the indicative annual allocation (to avoid a concentration of&#13;
funds on one type of training or beneficiaries). During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached on a Manual of Procedures for use of the VTF.&#13;
2.46  The project would finance an initial contribution to the Vocational Training Fund,&#13;
office equipment, materials, specialist services and development costs for the&#13;
establishment of the Fund, the development of its systems and procedures, the production&#13;
of its reports, and the monitoring and evaluation of the Sub-projects.&#13;
2.47 Program Development and Instructor Training (PDIT) Unit. At the request&#13;
of the VTF, the Program Development and Instructor Training Unit would assist the&#13;
training institutions in designing modular programs and in training instructors in the&#13;
delivery of these modules. The type of training to be financed under the Fund calls for&#13;
approaches and methods that are very different from those currently promoted in supply-&#13;
driven training institutions offering academic (as opposed to vocational) qualifications.&#13;
Changes are needed not only in the upgrading or learning of new skills in job analysis,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
determination of basic skills and competencies and training design, but also in the&#13;
management culture of the institutions responsible to prepare and deliver contract-based&#13;
training.&#13;
2.48  The project would support PDIT Unit staff development activities in the areas of&#13;
preparation of proposal, design of training programs and modules, instructor training, and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of training. Particular attention would be given to the&#13;
assessment of skills and competencies acquired during training which are in line with job&#13;
requirements, and their impact on productivity of skilled labor and enterprises hiring&#13;
them.&#13;
2.49  The project would finance office equipment, materials, specialist services and&#13;
development costs for the establishment of the Unit, the development of its methods, the&#13;
production of its reports, and the monitoring and evaluation of its activities.&#13;
2.50  Institutional Development for the Existing Vocational Training Institutions.&#13;
For the new system to be effective, existing training institutions will have to adapt to the&#13;
demand-driven delivery of services. During the start-up phase, three centers would be&#13;
reorganized with the view to strengthen their autonomy and accountability. These are:&#13;
the ENTP, the ENAC and the CNH. Their statutes would be revised and they would be&#13;
transferred under the authority of the OVT.  A substantial part of their recurrent&#13;
expenditure would continue to be financed by public funds through an annual budget&#13;
transfer to cover salaries and operating costs of existing full-time training programs&#13;
which are expected to be reviewed in the light of experience gained through contract-&#13;
financed training. However, an increasing part of their budget would be expected to be&#13;
generated from contracts financed either under the Fund (para. 2.44) or external sources.&#13;
Investment expenditures, mostly to acquire new equipment essential to deliver contract-&#13;
based training, would be financed through the Fund and/or self-generated revenues.&#13;
Participation from the private sector, for- as well as not-for profit, would be encouraged.&#13;
2.51  Once the new structures are in place and training institutions have gained&#13;
experience in contract-based training, the OVT would conduct a study on the financing of&#13;
vocational training institutions (public and private) with the view to increase the&#13;
participation of employers in training of their employees, to assess the cost-effectiveness&#13;
of various ways of delivering training and to design public financing mechanisms to meet&#13;
the goal of the new vocational training system.&#13;
2.52  The project would support technical assistance and development costs related to&#13;
the reorganization of existing vocational training institutions and the conduct of a study&#13;
on the financing of vocational training (para. 2.51). As pointed out above (para. 2.50),&#13;
the financing of recurrent and investment expenditure is expected to be borne by the&#13;
Treasury through budgetary transfers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
Objective 3: Develop Effective Project Management (estimated cost of US$0.8&#13;
million, or 11% of total base cost)&#13;
2.53  In 1994, the MOE created a central unit to coordinate all projects in the education&#13;
sector, the Centre National de Gestion et d'Execution des Projets d'Education&#13;
(CNGEPE). This unit took over the responsibility for implementation of the Second&#13;
Education Project, thus integrating staff from the project implementation unit (Bureau&#13;
d'Ex&amp;cution du Projet Education - BEPE) which had been created to coordinate&#13;
implementation of the Second Education Project. In the course of the preparation of&#13;
PRET, the CNGEPE played a key role, providing technical support and secretariat&#13;
functions to the Steering Committee in charge of the national consultations and the&#13;
preparation of the sector development plan.&#13;
2.54 To assist in implementation of the Program, the CNGEPE is expected to continue&#13;
to play a coordination role vis-a-vis the donors and the various agencies responsible for&#13;
implementation of various projects and sub-projects. In particular, it would seek co-&#13;
financing arrangements with national and international donors, coordinate the various&#13;
projects negotiated and financed under the Program, follow-up on implementation of the&#13;
Government's Program for the Reinforcement of Education and Training, and prepare&#13;
progress reports for dissemination to Government and the public.&#13;
2.55  In consultation with donors, the MOE decided to establish, as appropriate,&#13;
separate project implementation units to supervise implementation of project-financed&#13;
activities and manage the day-to-day operations. Accordingly, the project would support&#13;
the establishment of an independent Project Management Unit (PMU) which would liaise&#13;
with CNGEPE to ensure efficient coordination of activities under the PRET. The roles&#13;
and responsibilities, as well as the staffing of the PMU, are detailed in Chapter 3 on&#13;
Project Implementation. During negotiations, agreement was reached on an action&#13;
program for the establishment of a PMU under the Ministry of Education, including its&#13;
structure and its composition and the recruitment of the regional officers.&#13;
2.56  The project would support the creation of the PMU. The project would finance&#13;
rehabilitation of facilities to house the PMU, office equipment, materials, specialist&#13;
services and development costs for the establishment of the PMU, the development of&#13;
management systems and procedures, the production of its reports, and the monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of the new vocational training system.&#13;
2.57  During negotiations, agreement was reached on a detailed project implementation&#13;
schedule for the period between Appraisal and the end of 1998 including detailed Terms&#13;
of Reference for specialist services, a procurement plan for works, goods and technical&#13;
assistance services to be procured during that period, and performance indicators to be&#13;
monitored.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
3.1    Summary of Project Costs. The total project cost is estimated at US$7.5 million&#13;
equivalent, including Government's (US$0.3 million) and communities' / beneficiaries'&#13;
(US$0.2 million) contributions, contingencies, and taxes on supplies procured locally.&#13;
The base cost is estimated at US$7.0 million. Total contingencies (US$0.5 million)&#13;
represent 7 percent of the base cost. Detailed project costs by year, purpose, component&#13;
and category can be found in Annex 2.&#13;

3.2    A detailed identification of the classrooms construction or rehabilitation was&#13;
processed during project preparation. Cost estimate for construction or rehabilitation are&#13;
based on the costs currently used -- including provision of sanitary facilities on the school&#13;
ground, basic equipment and furniture: US$21,250 for construction of a classroom of 40&#13;
pupils (including community participation), and an average of 60 percent of that cost for&#13;
rehabilitation.&#13;
3.3   The cost estimate for equipment and vehicles was prepared by the Government&#13;
and reviewed by the Appraisal mission. The lists were prioritized according to need and&#13;
projected student cohorts, and costed on the basis of recent catalogues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
3.4   The unit cost of foreign and local consultants are based on actual costs for similar&#13;
services during project preparation. Unit costs for the implementation team are based on&#13;
actual cost.&#13;
3.5   The cost estimate for training sub-projects was finalized by Government officials&#13;
during project preparation. The average cost of a sub-project is estimated at US$8,000.&#13;
The training sub-projects would be partially financed by the Training Fund (90 percent on&#13;
average) and the beneficiaries (the remaining amount, or 1 0 percent on average).&#13;
3.6   Contingencies Allowances.  Project costs include a physical contingency&#13;
allowance (US$0.2 million) equal to a 2 percent increase in the estimated costs of all&#13;
project inputs. Price contingencies are estimated on the basis of the implementation&#13;
schedule and on a price increase of 3.7 percent p.a. for local costs and 2.3 percent p.a. for&#13;
foreign costs. Total price contingencies represent 5 percent of the base line cost and&#13;
physical contingencies.&#13;
3.7   Foreign Exchange Costs. The direct and indirect foreign exchange component&#13;
of US$4.5 million, or 60 percent of total estimated project cost, was estimated as follows&#13;
for each type of expenditure: (a) civil works, US$1.8 million; (b) equipment and vehicles,&#13;
US$0.8 million; (c) textbooks and instructional materials, US$0.6 million; (d) consultant&#13;
services and training, US$0.6 million; (e) training fund, US$0.3 million; and (f)&#13;
incremental operating costs, US$0.4 million.&#13;
3.8   Taxes. Project costs include local and indirect taxes on supplies procured locally,&#13;
which are estimated to be about US$0.5 million equivalent.  Direct imports and&#13;
consultant fees will be exempt from tax and duties.&#13;
3.9   Incremental Recurrent Costs. During Negotiations, agreement was reached on&#13;
annual counterpart financing requirements and annual budget provisions sufficient to&#13;
cover additional recurrent costs resulting from the project. The financial impact of the&#13;
project will be carefully examined during annual reviews.&#13;
3.10  Project Financing. The proposed ITF Credit of US$7.0 million will finance 100&#13;
percent of foreign costs, 95 percent of local costs for civil works, equipment, textbooks&#13;
and instructional materials, and 90 percent for operating costs, for an aggregate of about&#13;
93 percent of total project costs.&#13;
3.11   During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following policies and&#13;
measures which would be confirmed in a Letter of Development Policy to be submitted&#13;
to IDA before Board presentation:&#13;
(a)   provision of adequate budgetary support for non-salary expenditures and&#13;
the part which would be delegated to local School Committees. The initial&#13;
budget would be no less than 120 million FC in 1997 and transferred to&#13;
the schools in time for the start of the 1997-98 academic year (by end of&#13;
October 1997 at the latest). The level of the budgetary support for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
subsequent years would be determined annually in the context of the&#13;
Review of Public Expenditure in the sector;&#13;
(b)   an action program, including a timetable and performance indicators, on&#13;
the recruitment of approximately 100 teachers, in accordance with the&#13;
agreed upon numbers in the civil service reform program;&#13;
(c)   the regular payment of salaries to teachers and staff in MOE;&#13;
(d)   the enforcement of the prescribed number of school days (160) during the&#13;
academic year; and&#13;
(e)   a freeze on the replacement of managerial and supervisory staff in existing&#13;
Directorates, Services or schools until detailed job descriptions and&#13;
profiles have been approved by MOE and selection procedures modified to&#13;
ensure application of the minimum basic requirements for each job and&#13;
transparency in the process of recruitment.&#13;
B. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.12  All Bank-financed procurement of goods and services under the Project will be in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines. The Interim Trust Fund eligibility rules will apply.&#13;
Table I below summarizes the project elements as well as their estimated costs and&#13;
proposed methods of procurement.  The Borrower's procurement regulations and&#13;
procedures have been reviewed by IDA. IDA standard bidding documents will continue&#13;
to be systematically used for local procurement. ICB procurement will use the Bank's&#13;
relevant Standard Bidding Documents. Selection of consulting firms will be done on the&#13;
basis of the Bank's standard letter of invitation and form of contract. Under the project,&#13;
procurement procedures will be undertaken as summarized in Table 3.2 below and&#13;
described in the following paragraphs. The aggregate amounts provided include taxes&#13;
and duties.&#13;

3.13   Civil Works. Civil works include: (a) construction and rehabilitation of primary&#13;
classrooms and/or schools in deprived areas, with the participation of local communities&#13;
(US$2.67 million equivalent) (b) rehabilitation of an existing building for the MOE's&#13;
PMU (US$50,000) and (c) rehabilitation of an existing building for the OVT&#13;
(US$40,000). Based on experience gained during implementation of the PHRD project,&#13;
in particular its community development fund (FADC), it is anticipated that&#13;
approximately 40 percent of civil works for construction and rehabilitation of primary&#13;
schools (or US$1.0 million equivalent) will be carried out by local communities&#13;
according to procedures specified in the Manual of Procedures agreed by IDA. The&#13;
remaining 60 percent of works (or US$1.7 million equivalent, each estimated to cost&#13;
US$30,000 or less) will be carried out by small enterprises that already exist in the&#13;
Comoros, and procured under lump-sum, fixed-priced contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written&#13;
invitation. Civil works for rehabilitation of PMU and OVT (estimated to cost about&#13;
US$90,000) would be procured under contracts awarded under National Competitive&#13;
Bidding (NCB) procedures. It is expected that procurement for all civil works will be&#13;
managed by the PMU with the assistance of private firms to be selected by the PMU&#13;
through procedures acceptable to IDA. All works will be monitored by the contracted&#13;
private firm(s). Architectural designs will use the norms currently applied in the&#13;
Comoros and agreed by IDA.&#13;
3.14 Equipment and Vehicles. The equipment and vehicles financed by the project&#13;
(US$1.1 million equivalent) include: (a) office equipment and furniture, and vehicles&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
(US$0.44 million); and (b) equipment and furniture for classrooms (US$0.66 million).&#13;
To the extent possible, goods will be grouped into packages of US$100,000 or more, and&#13;
procured through ICB in accordance with Bank procurement procedures (January 1995).&#13;
Goods which cannot be grouped into these packages would be grouped to the extent&#13;
possible in packages of US$20,000 or more per contract to be procured through NCB,&#13;
provided that the aggregate amount of such procurement does not exceed US$600,000.&#13;
Goods that cannot be grouped into packages of US$20,000 would be procured through&#13;
national shopping, based on quotations obtained from at least three reliable suppliers,&#13;
provided the aggregate amount of such procurement does not exceed US$100,000.&#13;
3.15  Textbooks and Instructional Materials. Textbooks and instructional materials&#13;
(US$600,000) will be procured through ICB. The contracts will be in conformity with&#13;
standard Bank documents. Reference books and library books (US$100,000) estimated&#13;
to cost less than US$20,000 equivalent per contract up to an aggregate amount not to&#13;
exceed US$100,000 would be procured through international shopping, and contracts will&#13;
be in conformity with standard Bank documents. Distribution of textbooks and materials&#13;
to schools will be procured through NCB.&#13;
3.16  Consultants Services and Training. The project will finance approximately 54&#13;
person-months of foreign consultant services and 13 person-months of local consultant&#13;
services for management, procurement, auditing and various sectoral and technical&#13;
services, including training, totaling the aggregate amount of US$700,000 equivalent.&#13;
Consultants' services would be procured in accordance with the provision of the&#13;
Guidelines. Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers&#13;
published by the Bank in January 1997.  Annex 3 provides a detailed plan for&#13;
consultancies and training activities financed under the project.&#13;
3.17 Training Fund. The Training Fund of US$0.4 million will finance about 90&#13;
percent of the costs of training sub-projects including: (a) identification, preparation,&#13;
supervision and evaluation; (b) purchase of equipment and instructional materials; and (c)&#13;
training of trainers. Implementation and financing of each sub-project will be governed&#13;
by a tripartite contract between OVT, the beneficiary(ies) and the institution providing&#13;
training, according to procurement procedures specified in the Manual of Procedures&#13;
agreed by IDA.&#13;
3.18 Review by IDA. The PMU will ensure that Bank guidelines are followed for&#13;
procurement of goods and services, and will maintain procurement documents and&#13;
contracts required for ex-post reviews. During project execution, civil works contracts&#13;
and for packages of goods above the threshold of US$50,000 will be subject to IDA's&#13;
prior review. The threshold for prior review of consultant services will be US$50.000 for&#13;
contracts with consulting firms, and US$25,000 for contracts with individual consultants.&#13;
All other contracts will be subject to selective post review during the supervision&#13;
missions. Contracts for training sub-projects financed by the Training Fund amounting to&#13;
US$15,000 or more, as well as the first three applications to be submitted by OVT for&#13;
approval, irrespective of amounts involved, will be subject to prior review by IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
3.19 Procurement Schedule. Based on implementation schedules in Annexes 3 and 4,&#13;
procurement arrangements and the procurement schedule will be prepared for each year,&#13;
and the first year program will be prepared before effectiveness.&#13;
C. DISBURSEMENTS, ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT&#13;
3.20   Disbursements will be in accordance with guidelines set out in the Disbursement&#13;
Handbook. The project is expected to be completed over a five-year period, by end of&#13;
June 2002, and the Credit is expected to be closed by December 31, 2002. The proposed&#13;
allocation of the Credit is shown in Table 2. All applications to withdraw proceeds from&#13;
the Credit will be fully documented, except for expenditures for training, recurrent costs,&#13;
and for contracts with a value of US$50,000 (US$25,000 for individual consultants) or&#13;
less for goods and services for which reimbursement may be made against certified&#13;
statements of expenditures (SOEs).  The PMU  will be responsible for preparing&#13;
withdrawal applications and SOEs to be submitted to IDA, and will indicate on the SOEs&#13;
the nature and origin of any goods and the payment date. These will be retained along&#13;
with all other supporting documentation for review by Bank supervision missions and&#13;
independent auditors.&#13;

3.21   Special Accounts. To ensure that funds will be available when needed, two&#13;
Special Accounts (SA) in US$ will be established in a local commercial bank under&#13;
conditions applicable to IDA. One, with an initial deposit of US$350,000, will be in the&#13;
name of the PMU, and the other, with an initial deposit of US$150.000, will be in the&#13;
name of OVT. The amounts have been estimated to cover about four months of&#13;
expenditures, and would be withdrawn form the Credit account after effectiveness. PMU&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
and OVT would have the right to draw directly on these accounts for project expenditures&#13;
without prior approval by the Ministry of Finance. Two signatures would be required for&#13;
each payment, from among three people designated by the Ministry of Finance from the&#13;
staffs of each PMU and OVT on the nomination of the agency concerned. The Special&#13;
Accounts would be replenished on the basis of documentary evidence, provided to IDA&#13;
by PMU and OVT, of payments made from the accounts for goods and services required&#13;
for the project that are eligible for financing under the Credit. All supporting documents&#13;
will be retained by PMU and OVT, and made available for review by periodic Bank&#13;
supervision missions and external auditors.&#13;
3.22 Project Accounts. The Government will open a project account in a local&#13;
commercial bank, and pay into it its budgeted contribution to the project estimated for&#13;
1998 equivalent of about FC27 million. It will open two advance accounts in local&#13;
currency, operated by PMU and OVT, with initial deposits from the project account&#13;
equivalent to FC10 million and FC3 million respectively, to cover the Government's&#13;
contribution to project expenditures. Evidence of the initial deposits is a condition of&#13;
credit effectiveness. Thereafter, the Government will deposit each semester an amount&#13;
equal to the amount of the initial deposit into each of the Project accounts. The advance&#13;
accounts will be replenished regularly from the project account on the basis of&#13;
appropriate evidence of payment for the purpose of the project.&#13;
3.23  Auditing. Computerized accounting systems will be developed and implemented&#13;
prior to project effectiveness in the PMU and the OVT. PMU and OVT will maintain&#13;
separate accounts for all project activities, in conformity with international accounting&#13;
practices, to record all project expenditures, commitments and reimbursements. The&#13;
appointment of an independent auditor under a contract acceptable to IDA will be a&#13;
condition of effectiveness. The auditor's report will also include a separate opinion with&#13;
respect to SOEs, the Special Accounts and a statement of the adequacy or otherwise of&#13;
the accounting system and internal audit controls. During negotiations, the Government&#13;
gave assurances that annual audit reports, of reasonable scope and detail, will be&#13;
submitted to IDA within six months after the end of each fiscal year. Also, detailed terms&#13;
of reference for the recruitment of an auditor who would assist the Project Management&#13;
Unit and the Office for Vocational Training in setting appropriate project accounts&#13;
accounting procedures and who would audit the use of funds under the PPF were&#13;
reviewed and agreed upon.&#13;
3.24  Reports.  The PMU manager and OVT Director will be responsible for&#13;
submitting to IDA: (a) quarterly reports that will include project monitoring based on&#13;
agreed monitoring indicators (input and outcome) to be agreed upon at negotiations, a&#13;
summary of progress in procurement, and a definition of a work program with&#13;
monitorable outputs for the following three-month period; (b) periodic evaluation of the&#13;
training and skills of the technical assistance provided; (c) a report on the mid-term&#13;
evaluation of project progress; and (d) an Implementation Completion Report no later&#13;
than six months after the Closing Date of the Credit. During negotiations, an agreement&#13;
was reached on the content and format of annual reviews of work programs, including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
assessment of progress on performance indicators and preparation of detailed action plans&#13;
for the following period. Levels of budgetary resources, financial commitments and&#13;
disbursements from the Credit would be revised annually, and agreements would be&#13;
sought on adequate provisions of local funds (through the country's annual budget,&#13;
financing from local communities or participation of beneficiaries).&#13;
D. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
3.25  In line with strategic orientations which prioritize the empowerment of school&#13;
heads, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, partnership with community and&#13;
employers, the management of the project will be light, but effective. It will be oriented&#13;
towards the achievement of the goals of the Program for the Reinforcement of Education&#13;
and Training, the achievement of measurable objectives and the evaluation of&#13;
performance.&#13;
3.26  In order to improve access to quality primary education and to strengthen the&#13;
management of the education system, a Project Management Unit will have the task of:&#13;
(a) directing local and regional teams which will negotiate contracts of activities with&#13;
institutions and with parent-teacher associations; (b) coordinating the implementation of&#13;
programs of activities in close collaboration with the relevant local authorities; and (c)&#13;
measuring the achievement of defined objectives and evaluating the impact of measures&#13;
and actions which have been introduced on learning outcomes and the enrollment of&#13;
students.&#13;
3.27  The PMU would be placed under the authority of the Minister of Education. It&#13;
would liaise with the National Center for the Management and Implementation of&#13;
Education Projects (CNGEPE) to ensure efficient coordination of programs and projects&#13;
supporting the Government's PRET. Staff of the PMU would be hired under contract by&#13;
means of a transparent selection process and remunerated under the Credit: (a) a Project&#13;
Coordinator whose office will be located in Moroni; (b) a financial manager responsible&#13;
for keeping the books of the project and for managing the Credit; (c) a procurement&#13;
specialist responsible for the management of purchases and contracts of goods, works and&#13;
services; and (d) three regional coordinators, one officer per island, who will be&#13;
responsible for planning, coordinating, monitoring and the control of activities financed&#13;
under the Credit. Professional services required for specific operations will form the&#13;
object of separate contracts of employment, negotiated locally in accordance with&#13;
detailed terms of reference.&#13;
3.28  The management of activities will be supported by operational terms of reference&#13;
in contracts approved by the PMU. So as to reduce the cost of management, the project&#13;
will use existing resources in the Comoros in the form of contracts of services, for&#13;
example:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
(a)   for the rehabilitation and construction of classrooms, the PMU will engage&#13;
the services of engineering firms for the preparation of bidding documents,&#13;
the evaluation of bids and the supervision of work;&#13;
(b)   school furniture and educational materials will be procured by the central&#13;
office of the PMU in Grande Comore or by regional offices through&#13;
bidding procedures or through local consultation in accordance with Bank&#13;
procedures;&#13;
(c)   for quality inputs in education specified in the school-based contracts and&#13;
for the services of the MOE, each contract will specify outputs and&#13;
indicators of performance. Reimbursement of cost incurred will be in&#13;
accordance with the amounts indicated in the contract on the basis of&#13;
verification of observed results and supporting documentation.  For&#13;
example, the implementation of management tools in public primary&#13;
schools, the introduction of new educational methods and training to use&#13;
educational aids will be programmed in each school and approved by the&#13;
School Committee before submission to the PMU. Actual expenditure for&#13;
these activities and the respective contributions of the community, the&#13;
parent-teacher association and the school staff will be indicated in the plan&#13;
of action and will be reimbursed subject to confirmation of the services&#13;
rendered.&#13;
3.29 The programming of activities of the PMU will be submitted to the Bank for&#13;
review on October 31 of each year, at the latest. The proposed annual work plans and&#13;
budget for the next fiscal year will include details of proposed budgetary allocations and&#13;
disbursement estimates, and proposed procurement activities. Regional programming&#13;
will cover a horizon of two school years, namely the current year and the next, thus&#13;
permitting the coordination of rehabilitation operations and the provision of educational&#13;
materials with the beginning of the school year in September. Programming will&#13;
include: (a) a list of contracts and commitments negotiated with schools and the services&#13;
of the MOE; (b) a budget for current operations and for those operations which will begin&#13;
in the course of the school tern, accompanied by disbursement estimates; (c) projected&#13;
commitments and expenditures which shall be paid in the course of the 18-month period&#13;
following the commencement of the period indicated; and (d) a detailed plan of expected&#13;
results of measurable outputs which can be verified, as well as the evaluation to be&#13;
undertaken.&#13;
3.30 The PMU will apply the regulations of the Project Implementation Manual&#13;
approved by the Bank. This manual will include:&#13;
(a)   bidding procedures for rehabilitation work and the construction of&#13;
classrooms;&#13;
(b)   procedures for the procurement of school furniture, equipment,&#13;
educational materials and school supplies;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
(c)   model contracts between the school management committees and the&#13;
PMU. These contracts will specify the commitments and responsibilities&#13;
of each party, the nature of works and services, the objectives, indicators&#13;
of performance, the contribution of each party, schedule of payment and&#13;
the sanctions to be applied in the case of failure to meet the terms of&#13;
contract;&#13;
(d)   forms for the monitoring of the advancement of activities, for account&#13;
keeping and for the measuring of expected results and the certification of&#13;
services;&#13;
(e)   tools for the evaluation of results, including a list of indicators of&#13;
performance of the system, the results of evaluation of the learning&#13;
achievements of students in the schools which have benefited from&#13;
support by the project, and observations by officers of the PMU.&#13;
E. PROJECT MONITORING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
3.31  Project Monitoring. The PMU and the OVT will send IDA quarterly reports on&#13;
project progress that will include: (a) a summary statement on the status of execution of&#13;
each project activity; and (b) a table showing compliance with project covenants, and&#13;
progress in implementing agreed policy objectives. During Appraisal, an agreement was&#13;
reached on establishment of a management information system to enable the MOE to&#13;
track annual monitoring indicators; the establishment of the management information&#13;
system will be a condition of effectiveness.&#13;
3.32  Monitoring will be important to measure the effects of the project on primary&#13;
education and vocational training, and on the system-wide effects of the program's&#13;
(PRET) proposed policy actions. Indicators will include: enrollment and pass rates;&#13;
attendance to school; resource mobilization levels and cost recovery rates; teaching staff&#13;
performance; school supervision performance; and indicators showing the state of&#13;
maintenance of schools. Annex 5 provides a list of outcomes and performance indicators&#13;
to be agreed during negotiations.&#13;
3.33  Supervision.  The project will not require special supervision arrangements&#13;
except during the start-up phase. Supervision missions will be planned to coincide with&#13;
important implementation milestones. The first full IDA mission will take the form of a&#13;
project launch workshop, continuing and expanding the working format developed with&#13;
MOE and the CNGEPE during the project preparation and appraisal process. The&#13;
workshop will confirm annual implementation targets, review monitoring procedures and&#13;
review the Procedure Manuals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
3.34  The project has been classified as C ("No appreciable environment impact"). The&#13;
environmental impact of the proposed project is expected to be neutral. There would be&#13;
environmental disruptions associated with the construction of small primary schools.&#13;
However, the project would improve the sanitary environment of about 120 existing&#13;
schools, which lack basic sanitary facilities, and provide such basic facilities for all new&#13;
construction. The project will finance teaching-learning materials and teacher training to&#13;
incorporate environmental education in the existing curriculum at primary level. Also,&#13;
under the Vocational Training Fund, training sub-projects could be approved for training&#13;
workers in the field of environmental protection.&#13;
G. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT&#13;
3.35  The economic analysis of the project includes: (a) an assessment of potential&#13;
savings that would be generated from an improvement in internal efficiency at primary&#13;
level; (b) an examination of equity issues including distribution of public spending on&#13;
education, and geographic, gender and income disparities; (c) an analysis of the&#13;
consistency of the education sector budget with the overall macroeconomic framework;&#13;
and (d) an examination of the rationale for public intervention in vocational training and&#13;
the rate of return associated with vocational training.&#13;
3.36  Internal Efficiency.  In a context of severely constrained public resources,&#13;
savings generated through improvement of internal efficiency can be substantial. Based&#13;
on 1993-94 data, computation of student flows shows that it takes on average 4.9 times&#13;
longer to produce a primary-school graduate in the Comoros than in a system with no&#13;
repetition or dropouts. As a result of measures to be implemented during the project, it is&#13;
expected that reductions in the drop-out and repetition rates would: (a) reduce the average&#13;
number of student-years to produce a graduate from 29.6 to 8.1; (b) generate savings up&#13;
to 350,000 FC per graduate; and (c) increase the number of children completing Grade 4&#13;
by 88 percent (or from 48 percent to 90 percent of the cohort completing Grade 4).&#13;
3.37  Equity. The Gini coefficient associated with the distribution of public spending&#13;
on education is currently 0.46. Analysis shows that et ceteris paribus: (a) increasing&#13;
primary enrollment ratio and (b) increasing unit spending in primary education would&#13;
reduce the Gini coefficient significantly. For example, a one-point increase in primary&#13;
enrollment ratio reduces the Gini coefficient by about 2 percent, while an increase in unit&#13;
spending of 5,000 FC reduces the Gini coefficient by about 1.3 percent. The analysis has&#13;
also permitted to identify underserved districts for targeted intervention, on the basis of&#13;
gross and net enrollment ratios, new entrants in Grade 1 and gender disparities.&#13;
3.38  Sustainability.  In terms of financial sustainability, the investments planned&#13;
under this project will require that the Government undertake a series of measures to&#13;
increase public revenues, to allocate sufficient levels of public resources to education, and&#13;
to rationalize expenditures in the sector. During appraisal, agreement was reached on: (a)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
a sustainable Public Expenditure Program (both investment and recurrent) for the period&#13;
1997-1999; and (b) the level and composition of the recurrent budget for salary and non-&#13;
salary expenditures. Proposals for alternative investment and recurrent budgets were&#13;
discussed with Government in the context of a joint Bank/IMF mission that visited the&#13;
Comoros in January/February 1997. These proposals are described in Section C of Annex&#13;
6.&#13;
3.39 Vocational Training. While there is a need for government to reassess its role as&#13;
provider and principal financier of technical education, government intervention is still&#13;
desirable for two reasons. First, there are acute coordination problems in the Comoros.&#13;
Most enterprises are too small to individually incur the overhead costs of training&#13;
programs, and since the cost of coordinating with other enterprises in the sector is high,&#13;
the demand for training is likely to be sub-optimal. By acting as coordinator and&#13;
facilitator, the Government can usefully contribute to the well-functioning training&#13;
system. Second, there are externalities associated with some vocational training&#13;
schemes that are not captured by the beneficiaries of the training. There is a risk that&#13;
private demand for training be sub-optimal from a social viewpoint. The proposed&#13;
Vocational Training Fund will discriminate between the different training schemes. In&#13;
areas where there is a presumption that benefits are captured by the beneficiaries, the&#13;
Fund's contribution will be limited to support government's role of facilitator and&#13;
coordinator. In areas where there are large external benefits, the Fund might subsidize&#13;
part of the training scheme. Thus, the Fund would be used as an instrument to modulate&#13;
the form of government intervention and the extent of public financial involvement.&#13;
Based on a quick survey conducted during project preparation, the rate of return of&#13;
vocational training is estimated at 27 percent.&#13;
3.40  Consistency with CAS.  The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the&#13;
Comoros calls for: enhanced competitiveness for sustained growth; human capital&#13;
development, poverty reduction, and population growth control; and protection of the&#13;
environment.  In the education sector, the CAS objectives are to: (a) protect real&#13;
expenditures in the sector; (b) improve efficiency of staff through effective deployment&#13;
and control at school level; and (c) improve participation in quality education, especially&#13;
for girls, and upgrade competencies of workers in a changing environment (export-led&#13;
and private-sector based economic development).&#13;
3.41  The CAS also supports broadening the support base for, and building of greater&#13;
local ownership of development operations. The CAS proposes that the Third Education&#13;
Project place greater management and financial responsibility and accountability at the&#13;
school level than in the past.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
4.1   The benefits would include improved access to quality basic education especially&#13;
for the poor, improved learning and academic achievement at primary level, increased&#13;
enrollments and internal efficiency. Also, the quality of school-level infrastructures and&#13;
teaching/learning processes would be improved using collaborative mechanisms and&#13;
improved management systems in MOE. Apprentices and workers would improve their&#13;
qualifications and increase their productivity in the workplace. The establishment of a&#13;
competitive, demand-driven training system based on training sub-projects designed&#13;
jointly between employers and trainers would improve internal and external efficiency of&#13;
the training system.&#13;
B. RiSKS&#13;
4.2   There are three risks foreseen at this point.  First, the recently appointed&#13;
Government may not be committed to put the structural adjustment program back on&#13;
track and provide appropriate level of public resources in the sector. The 1992-94&#13;
implementation record on structural reform indicates that a sound macro-economic&#13;
framework can be worked out. An agreement with the IMF and the Bank on an agenda&#13;
for further structural reforms would mitigate that risk. Second, MOE's capacity to follow&#13;
through on commitments and the local communities' ability to take responsibility on&#13;
school management remains largely untested. Third, teacher unions may continue to&#13;
disrupt operation of the public education system, especially if salaries are not paid on&#13;
time and if vacant positions are not filled quickly. To minimize these risks, the Bank will&#13;
seek endorsement of stakeholders to achieve the goals, policies, orientations and action&#13;
plans outlined in the PRET. To this end, IEC campaigns and activities aimed at&#13;
supporting the change process would be organized throughout 1997 to build consensus in&#13;
the footsteps of the consultative process initiated in 1994 during the Etats Generaux de&#13;
l'education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Section A:   Primary Education: Internal Efficiency&#13;
In a context of severely constrained public resources, savings that can be made by&#13;
improving internal efficiency may be one of the precious few alternatives left to ensure&#13;
that adequate resources are allocated to the subsector. This section examines the present&#13;
internal efficiency status of public primary schools and assesses whether there is room for&#13;
improvement. If savings from gains in efficiency are potentially high, then there are&#13;
potentially equally high payoffs to improving student flow.&#13;
The table below summarizes the present status of repetitions and dropouts in primary&#13;
schools in the Comoros.&#13;

The information above can be usefully condensed into the following indicators:&#13;
* Number of student-years to produce 77 primary school graduates = 2,282&#13;
* Number of student-years to produce one primary school graduate = 29.6&#13;
*  Wastage ratio = 4.9&#13;
* Percentage of initial cohort that passes CM2 without repetition = 1%&#13;
*  Survival rate to CM2 allowing for 2 repetitions = 31 %&#13;
* Percentage of cohort that completes CE2 = 48%&#13;
In other words, it takes on average 4.9 times longer to produce a primary-school graduate&#13;
in the Comoros than in a system with no repetition or dropouts. Such a system is but a&#13;
distant ideal, and one may argue that those savings are theoretical. For that reason, the&#13;
wastage ratio associated with a more realistic4 scenario for improvement in internal&#13;
efficiency is also computed. Table 3a shows what improvements result from improving&#13;
internal efficiency, and the potential savings per graduate produced vis-a-vis both the&#13;
long-term ideal and the more realistic medium-term target.&#13;

Most of the potential savings can be generated in the medium term with very realistic&#13;
targets for improvements in internal efficiency. In addition to the savings in the&#13;
education system, speedier graduation means that students spend less time at school, so&#13;
that both direct and opportunity costs incurred by households are lower.&#13;
The improvements in the system can also be read in education terms, as in table 3b.&#13;
Table 3b: Education indicators&#13;
Present          Medium-term target&#13;
% of cohort completing primary    8%            67%&#13;
% of cohort completing grade 4  48%             90%&#13;
These indicators can be computed regularly during and after project implementation and&#13;
could be used to monitor progress against the benchmarks established in tables 3a and 3b.&#13;
Resources freed up by improving internal efficiency can be utilized in two ways: (i) the&#13;
intake of students could be reduced without changing the number of graduates, and the&#13;
savings generated could be allocated anywhere else within or outside the education&#13;
system; or (ii) the savings could be used to increase the intake of students and thereby of&#13;
graduates. In view of the fact that university primary enrollment is a declared objective&#13;
of the GOC, it is appropriate that the freed-up resources be allocated to accommodate&#13;
more children in the school system.&#13;
The question then is how best to use these savings in order to increase enrollment; in&#13;
other words, what are the most cost-effective ways of achieving this objective. The&#13;
community-based approach retained in the GOC strategy and adopted in this project&#13;
could indeed be the best instrument by which to determine what the most cost-effective&#13;
investments are for each school if only because the stakeholders are given a real&#13;
opportunity to analyze problems, prioritize corrective actions, mobilize staff, and change&#13;
the school environment as appropriate. This heuristic process is more likely to yield the&#13;
best mix of inputs and measures to correct a malfunctioning school than is a&#13;
deterministic, top-down approach. The following additional elements militate in favor of&#13;
the community-based approach: (i) by giving communities an opportunity to create and&#13;
manage assets, their role in the education sector changes from that of consumers to that of&#13;
stakeholders; (ii) stakeholders are informed of the financial and social cost implications&#13;
of low efficiency and are therefore more concerned about dropout and repetition; and (iii)&#13;
the system would be building upon an existing track record of strong communal ties and&#13;
community involvement in the creation and management of assets.&#13;
&#13;

Section B:   Equity Issues&#13;
Judgments about equality of distribution of education benefits depend upon the particular&#13;
criterion - of which there exist many - for measuring the distribution of benefits. Four&#13;
such equity indexes are computed here which, while they do not exhaust the equity&#13;
question, help to show that the proposed investment will lead to less inequality, and that&#13;
it will favor disadvantaged groups/sectors.&#13;
B. 1   Equity in the Distribution of Public Spending on Education&#13;
A first way of addressing the equity issue is to look at who benefits from system-wide&#13;
public spending in education: the more students progress in the education system, the&#13;
6&#13;
more public resources they cumulate . Equity in this particular sense therefore hinges&#13;
upon two elements: the enrollment ratio and the level of public spending per student at&#13;
each level. Table 4a below shows the enrollment ratio and unit cost structure in the&#13;
Comoros which is the basis for the assessment on the status of equity.&#13;

of one hundred representative school-age children.&#13;

Finally, the information can be used to compute a Gini coefficient (table 4c). The&#13;
computed value of 0.46 indicates that there is still room for improvement in the equality&#13;
of spending of public resources in education&#13;
Table 4c: Summary Information and Gini Coefficient&#13;

Derived Gini coefficient        0.46&#13;
Charts 2a and 2b9 below indicate the potential effects on the Gini coefficient of (a)&#13;
increasing the primary enrollment ratio from 89 to 100, and (b) increasing unit public&#13;
spending in primary education, both of which are objectives towards which the project&#13;
contributes. A similar analysis demonstrates that a ceteris paribus increase in enrollments&#13;
or unit spending in upper secondary will cause the Gini coefficient to worsen. The equity&#13;
analysis therefore suggests freeing up public resources from upper secondary level and&#13;
reallocating these resources at primary level. The accompanying policy recommendation&#13;
would be a greater reliance on the private sector for the provision of education at upper&#13;

The charts above clearly indicate that a ceteris paribus increase in primary enrollments&#13;
significantly improves the equity status of public spending in education (a one-point rise&#13;
in the primary enrollment ratio reduces the Gini coefficient by about 2%). Increased&#13;
public unit spending in primary education also improves the Gini coefficient (an increase&#13;
in unit spending of FC 5,000 reduces the Gini coefficient by about 1.3%). The obvious&#13;
limitation of the above analysis is that it does not help determine whether the absolute&#13;
level of unit costs by subsector is adequate.&#13;
B.2    Geographic disparities&#13;
Another possible source of inequit,y is geographical coverage. Charts 3a, 3b, and 3c&#13;
below plot representation indexes ° for each of the school-districts (CIPRs). Those&#13;
districts that are under-represented are pointed out.&#13;

Cumulative percentages of population age 7 by CIPR&#13;
From the charts above, it is obvious that the CIPRs which need particular attention are&#13;
Hamahame and Uziwani in Grande Comore, and Domoni, Nyumakele and Sima in&#13;
Anjouan. To maintain inter-island equity, the CIPR of Fomboni (Moheli) is also&#13;
regarded as needing priority attention.&#13;
B.3    Gender disparities&#13;
The representation index for net primary enrollments was also calculated separately for&#13;
males and females. Table 5 below indicates that there is a slight overall bias in the&#13;
Comoros in favor of males. Disaggregation by island shows a more complex picture:&#13;
Grande Comore shows equal representation of both sexes, while Anjouan exhibits serious&#13;
under-representation of girls in primary schools.&#13;

Interestingly, the gender analysis yields the same priorities as the geographic one. The&#13;
project's focus on expanding enrollments and improving the learning environment in&#13;
Hamahame, Uziwani, Fomboni, Domoni, Nyumakele and Sima therefore simultaneously&#13;
addresses gender and geographic inequities.&#13;

B. 4   Income disparities&#13;
The last equity issue addressed here is whether there is an enrollment bias against poor&#13;
people. Table 6"1 below indicates that schooling attainment at primary level is only&#13;
loosely related to income level. Biases are more significant at secondary level - access to&#13;
school is then more obviously related to income level.&#13;
By focusing on primary education, the project can therefore be said to favor that sub-&#13;
sector which discriminates least against poor households.  The effect of project&#13;
involvement in secondary technical schooling upon equity is rather more difficult to&#13;
assess. First, participation in secondary technical education exhibits a lower income bias&#13;
than for upper secondary education and above - in other words, it seems that technical&#13;
education is less inaccessible to poorer students than is general secondary education. But&#13;
since technical education does display some degree of income bias, it could be argued&#13;
that the project accentuates an anti-poor bias. However, the mode of delivery proposed by&#13;
the project is very different from the traditional system which does seem to favor students&#13;

from wealthier households - if only because they are the ones most likely to reach lower&#13;
secondary which is a pre-requisite for entry in the existing vocational training programs.&#13;
The proposed delivery mode is demand-driven and benefits the enterprise and its&#13;
employees - there is therefore no a priori reason why this system should favor wealthier&#13;
over poorer employees.&#13;

Section C:    Budget execution in the education sector and sustainability&#13;
The most important issue that remains to be addressed is that of the sustainability of&#13;
education projects. Budget allocation as such does not seem to be a problem. Chart 5&#13;
below shows that the education sector has been relatively spared in a context of fiscal&#13;
austerity.&#13;

The amount allocated to the education sector consistently represents twenty percent or&#13;
more of total government expenditures. However this budget allocation is largely&#13;
theoretical - the actual amount disbursed is far lower and payment is erratic. The&#13;
situation as far as salary goes is the same as in the rest of the civil service (in January&#13;
1997, payment arrears reached an estimated ten months); non-salary budget execution in&#13;
the education sector, shown in chart 6 below, is equally unpredictable.&#13;

Part of the problem can only be dealt with at the macroeconomic level (all measures&#13;
aiming at improving government finances through better tax and customs administration,&#13;
civil service reform, line item budget management ("gestion par poste budgetaire") and&#13;
through resumption of growth. A number of savings measures can also be implemented&#13;
at the education sector level to ensure that adequate resources are allocated in order that&#13;

the proposed activities be carried out. The project supports three such series of measures:&#13;
(a) savings generated by improving the internal efficiency of the system; (b) savings&#13;
realized through the rationalization of general and technical secondary schools; and (c)&#13;
core operation support in the education sector.&#13;
The remainder of this Section is a proposal for alternative investment and recurrent&#13;
budgets. These budget proposals are believed to be more realistic in view of the likely&#13;
levels of donor involvement and of government finances. These proposals were discussed&#13;
with GOC both during the joint Bank/IMF mission that visited the Comoros in January&#13;
1997 and the Education Sector mission that visited the Comoros in late February.&#13;
A. Investment Budget&#13;
To support the objectives of the Program for the Reinforcement of Education and&#13;
Training (PRET), the following "realistic" 14 investment plan is proposed for the period&#13;
1997 to 2001.&#13;

14  The PRET (May 1996 draft) envisages an investment program of FC 13.2 billion over a five-year&#13;
period, of which 12.1 would financed by external assistance; the breakdown by year looks as follows:&#13;
(billion FC)                 1997      1998      1999      2000      2001      Total&#13;

15  Note: the exchange rate as of January 1997 was 400 FC/US$&#13;
16 External assistance is mostly comprised of FF6 million envisaged by the French Cooperation over a&#13;
period of 3 years, and US$6.3 million IDA credit (excluding US$0.71 million for Project Preparation)&#13;
over a period of 5 years.&#13;

Comoros has a poor record for both salary and non-salary budget execution (cf. chart 6&#13;
above). This record provides the motivation for "core operatinon" approach which&#13;
allocates resources to those categories that are essential to allow the system to function&#13;
and puts a cap on the other non-essential categories. To ensure a functioning and&#13;
sustainable education system in the Comoros, (i) teachers salaries must be paid regularly;&#13;
(ii) adequate resources must be allocated at school-level and for critical support systems&#13;
in order that "core operations" be carried out; and (iii) other non-salary expenditures need&#13;
to be capped. These three elements are discussed in turn now.&#13;
B. I Salaries&#13;
Realistic wage bill projections for 1997 would require adding to the 1995 wage bill&#13;
(FC2.55 billion), (i) the salary payments of the 300 recruits of 1996, and (ii) salary&#13;
increases. The sum of these two items is estimated at FCO.3 billion. The results from the&#13;
two surveys in 1996 will permit a better estimate of wage bill for 1997.&#13;
The issue of payment of salary arrears17 also has to be addressed. It is unlikely that the&#13;
GOC will be able to pay these arrears in one installment - what is proposed instead is a&#13;
payment plan staggered over a period of three years; for example, two months in 1997,&#13;
18&#13;
four months in 1998 and the final four in 19991 .&#13;
For this budget category, the objectives in 1997 would therefore be two-fold: (i) ensure&#13;
the timely payment of salaries - i.e. no accumulation of additional arrears; (ii) pay a&#13;
portion (two months) of the salary arrears for 1995-1996.&#13;
B. 2 "Core operations"&#13;
"Core operations" would include the following: (a) transfering to schools the minimum&#13;
budgetary resources to provide teaching and learning materials for all primary and&#13;
secondary schools at the start of each year - the necessary funds are estimated at FC120.6&#13;
million; (b) ensuring that pedagogical visits of inspectors and pedagogical advisors to&#13;
schools are carried out regularly; an amount of FC 10.1 millions would be needed to fund&#13;
this activity; (c) organizing exams; this task would cost an estimated FC60.9 million; and&#13;
(d) carrying out a school/staff census every six months - which would cost an estimated&#13;
FC10 million. The total amount needed for these core operations is estimated at FC201.6&#13;
million.&#13;
17 An estimated ten months in January 1997.&#13;
18 If 2 months salary arrears are reimbursed in 1997, then a further FC425 million have to be budgeted.&#13;

B. 3 The ceiling non-salary budget&#13;
The projected cap for non-salary expenditures in 1997 is estimated by applying a small&#13;
growth coefficient (5%) to the 1995 non-salary budget from which spending for primary&#13;
and secondary (already included in the "core operations"), as well as tertiary (reliance on&#13;
private funding) have been subtracted. This amount is estimated at FC582 million.&#13;

Note that the proposed budget for 1997 (FC3.63 billion), is lower than the 1995 budget&#13;
(FC3.79 billion). It should therefore stand a better chance of being effectively disbursed.&#13;

Section D:   Vocational Training: Rationale for Public Intervention and Feasibility&#13;
D. I   Public intervention in vocational training&#13;
No general case can be made for public provision of vocational training, but a case can be&#13;
made for public intervention in vocational training. There is little or no dispute as to the&#13;
need to rationalize publicly-provided vocational training schools - the supply-driven&#13;
approach that currently exists has proven to be a failure. The proposed change to a&#13;
demand-driven system that is responsive to expressed needs is most urgent. While there&#13;
is a need for Govemnment to give up on its role as provider and principal financier of&#13;
technical education, there are reasons to believe that some forms of government&#13;
intervention in the field is still desirable and necessary.&#13;
The first reason is that there are acute coordination problems in the Comoros. Most&#13;
enterprises are too small to individually incur the overhead costs of training programs,&#13;
and since the cost of coordinating with other enterprises in the sector is high, the demand&#13;
for training is likely to be sub-optimal. By acting as coordinator and facilitator, the&#13;
Government can usefully contribute to the well-functioning training system.&#13;
The second reason is that there are externalities associated with some vocational training&#13;
schemes that are not captured by the beneficiaries of the training. Once again there is a&#13;
risk that private demand for training be sub-optimal from a social viewpoint. The&#13;
proposed Vocational Training Fund, which will be the principal instrument for furthering&#13;
the new technical training policy, will have to discriminate between the different training&#13;
schemes. In those areas where there is a presumption that benefits are captured by the&#13;
beneficiaries, the Fund would restrict its intervention to that of facilitator and coordinator:&#13;
fees paid by beneficiary firms and individuals will then have to cover the direct training&#13;
costs. In areas where there are large external benefits, the Fund might subsidize part of&#13;
the training scheme. According to its diagnostic of the particular distortion that is&#13;
causing sub-optimal outcomes in the training market, the Fund is therefore able to&#13;
modulate the form of its intervention as well as the extent of its financial involvement.&#13;
D.2   Rates of return&#13;
For lack of appropriate wage and cost data, it has not been possible to conduct a full-&#13;
fledged cost-benefit analysis. Based on a number of interviews carried out with private&#13;
sector employers'9 during the June 1996 and March 1997 missions, it was however&#13;
19  Included meeting with representatives of the tourism industry, small-scale textiles, fisheries,&#13;
construction, and informatics. The mission also met with the employer's union (OPACO) and with&#13;
the Association for the Promotion of the Private Sector (APSP).&#13;
&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report                                                   Annex 6&#13;
Third Education Project                                                   Page 15&#13;
possible to carry out a very rough estimate of rates of return for vocational training using&#13;
the short-cut method (see equation 1 below).&#13;
ROR = (Wvoc - WSEC)/(training duration * (unit cost of training + WSEC))  (1)&#13;
Estimated average unit cost of training: FC140,000 per year. Average duration of&#13;
training: 2.5 years. Average annual salary for a lower secondary school leaver:&#13;
FC360,000; average annual salary for a holder of a vocational training diploma:&#13;
FC700,000.&#13;
ROR = (700,000 - 360,000)/(2.5 * (140,000 + 360,000)) = 27%&#13;
This rough calculation indicates that the scheme is feasible. The proposed demand-&#13;
driven approach supported by the Vocational Training Fund is also likely to be superior&#13;
to the existing system. On the cost side, the new system will see a reduction in the&#13;
duration of training but an increase in unit cost: the likelihood is that overall costs in the&#13;
two systems would be comparable. On the benefit side however, the supply-driven&#13;
system offers no guarantee that the trainees will find employment, whereas the&#13;
beneficiaries of the training in a demand-driven system are, for the most part, already&#13;
employed and will, at worst, go back to their previous job with only a minimal salary rise.&#13;
Where Wvoc is the salary at labor market entry of a vocational training scheme graduate and WSEC is&#13;
the corresponding salary for a secondary school graduate.&#13;

            The Third Education Project will support
            investments in the first two priority sub-sectors identified
            in the Government's program for the Reinforcement of
            Education and Training, namely primary education and
            vocational training.  To ensure effective and timely
            implementation of the project, it will also support local
            capacity building in the planning, execution, monitoring and
            evaluation of sector management.  The project will improve
            learning at primary level through increased participation in
            quality education.  Participation will be improved through:
            (a) establishment of local school committees with financial
            and managerial authority on public primary schools; (b)
            provision of adequate infrastructure.  Quality of the
            teaching-learning processes will be improved through: (a)
            development of better management practices to monitor
            delivery of the study program; (b) provision of
            teaching/learning materials, both for class and individual
            learning activities; (c) changes in the teaching/learning
            methods used by teachers in the classroom; (d) changes in
            the supervision practices to develop and monitor
            implementation of effective teaching practices; and (e)
            support to development of learning assessment and education
            information systems at regional and central levels of the
            Ministry of Education (MOE).  The project will also improve
            competencies of skilled workers through the establishment of
            an autonomous, flexible and effective demand-driven training
            system in which training institutions and employers will get
            grants from the Government.  The establishment of a
            performing vocational training system will be achieved
            through the creation of a small, autonomous institution: the
            Office of Vocational Training (OVT).  Competencies and
            skills will be developed through: (a) support for management
            and the initial financing of a Vocational Training Fund
            (VTF); (b) support for the development of training modules;
            and (c) support for the reorganization of existing
            vocational  training institutions.  Finally, the project
            will support the development of effective project management
            capacities among staff in the Project Management Unit (PMU)
            and improve competencies of MOE authorities in planning,
            execution, monitoring and evaluation of the sector program.
