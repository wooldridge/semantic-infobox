THE CAPITAL GOODS SECTOR IN LDCs: A CASE FOR&#13;
STATE INTERVENTION?&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report, 1979&#13;
This study examines the case for the state promotion of machinery&#13;
production in LDCs. It begins by setting out the rationale for capital&#13;
goods manufacture in a range of semi-industralized developing countries.&#13;
The study then delineates the principal features of machinery production&#13;
which distinguish it from the consumer goods or process industries, with a&#13;
view to identifying the particular constraints to efficient operations in the&#13;
capital goods sector. The threefold typology of constraints which emerges&#13;
from this examination underlines the case for, and suggests the modalities&#13;
of, state intervention in the sector.&#13;

The Capital Goods Sector in LDCs:&#13;
A Case for State Intervention?&#13;
Summary and Conclusions&#13;
1.        This study explores three aspects of capital goods production in&#13;
developing countries. Part I sets out the case for the development of&#13;
machine-manufacturing industries in LDCs. Part II attempts to identify and&#13;
evaluate the constraints which lower the current efficiency of production&#13;
operations in LDC capital goods sectors, and which determine the dynamic&#13;
efficiency of LDC machine manufacture in the longer term.     Part III draws&#13;
up the case for state intervention in the sector.&#13;
Part I: The Rationale for Capital Goods Production in LDCs&#13;
2.        The most general argument marshalled in support of capital goods&#13;
production in LDC economies where export inelasticities constrain capital&#13;
goods imports, is that the expansion of domestic capital goods supply provides&#13;
the means for overcoming the problem of transforming savings into investment&#13;
and thereby serves to accelerate growth.&#13;
3.        The second argument stems from the need to "deepen" the industrial&#13;
structure: in certain LDCs, e.g., the semi-industrial LDCs, such as Korea&#13;
and Brazil, the pattern and volume of final and intermediate goods manufacture&#13;
has proceeded to the point where considerations of scale no longer argue&#13;
against backward integration into capital goods production.&#13;
4.        Mlachinery production and export /1 may also be appropriate for such&#13;
middle income countries as Korea, Brazil and Mexico. Faced with the&#13;
situation of current (and possible future) increases in wage levels and the&#13;
prospect of competition from LDCs which enjoy a larger (unskilled) wage advan-&#13;
tage, these countries may be induced, unless productivity increases compensate,&#13;
to move into the production of commodities which do not use unskilled labor&#13;
intensively.&#13;
5.        Further arguments for industrial deepening by selected LDCs are&#13;
provided by the move towards the adoption of protectionist regimes by certain&#13;
industrialized countries.   The curbs on traditional LDC exports (textiles,&#13;
footwear), which affect a wide range of LDCs, point to the need for restruc-&#13;
turing export baskets and production both within and between LDCs. The&#13;
capital goods sector provides one of the logical options for development:&#13;
the sector's products are relatively unaffected by protectionist measures;&#13;
LDC penetration of developed country markets is still at an early stage;&#13;
moreover, LDC machinery exports by virtue of their relative skill intensity do&#13;
not pose as large a threat (as do traditional exports) to the employment in&#13;
developed countries of unskilled labor - the group which appears to enjoy&#13;
little inter-industrial mobility, and provides some of the most vociferous&#13;
support for protectionist sentiment in DCs.&#13;
6.        Recent trends in international trade do in fact herald the move&#13;
to greater LDC concentration on capital goods exports.&#13;
(a) The growth rate of LDC machinery exports outstripped the growth rate&#13;
of LDC traditional exports over the period 1972-76.&#13;
/1 By virtue of their skill-intensity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
(b) LDC machinery exports have been exploiting the largest/fastest-&#13;
growing markets for capital goods, e.g., the US, Japan.&#13;
(c) Despite the large weight of relatively simple products such as&#13;
sewing machines, bicycles, etc., in LDC machinery /1 exports,&#13;
the data (e.g., for Brazil, Argentina, the Republic of China)&#13;
suggests that a beginning has been made in integrating back from&#13;
these products into more diversified and complex lines of machinery.&#13;
This was the historical pattern in the US.&#13;
(d) The most rapidly growing market exploited by LDCs is the combined&#13;
LDC market itself: about 45% of LDC capital goods exports was&#13;
absorbed by developing countries in 1975/76.&#13;
7.        One rationale for this faster growth lies perhaps in the alleged&#13;
"appropriateness" of LDC exports to LDC needs. This is because: (a) income&#13;
levels determine the type/quality of final products consumed, and the latter&#13;
in turn determines the nature and quality of the capital goods which are&#13;
required to produce the final products;/2 and (b) LDCs tend to produce&#13;
equipment which is more in line with LDC relative factor endowments, more&#13;
specifically LDC skill endowments.                                   1&#13;
8.        Certain middle-income LDCs are currently (and potentially) relatively&#13;
well-endowed with skilled labor, trained engineers and technicians; this&#13;
should confer a relative advantage in the production and marketing of capital&#13;
goods, both activities being relatively skilled labor-intensive.&#13;
9.        Despite the emphasis on the exploitation of scale economies in&#13;
capital goods production, certain equipment-producing sectors in the US,&#13;
Japan and Germany are characterized by small-sized firms. Small-sized firms&#13;
apparently succeed in capturing scale economies and in exhibiting competitive&#13;
efficiency, where the product range is successfully restricted to one or a&#13;
few products produced in large volume, or where the organizational require-&#13;
ments of production militate against large size. In these sectors, the&#13;
relatively smaller size of LDC firms /3 (conditioned in part by capital&#13;
constraints, prevailing organizational practices, etc.), would appear to&#13;
confer an advantage.&#13;
10.       Production conditions currently in existence in other LDC sectors&#13;
may confer an externality on capital goods production; machine repair skills&#13;
and facilities already available in certain regions of LDCs may provide the&#13;
seedbed for the start of production operations.&#13;
/I Defined as SITC 7.&#13;
/2 This is not, however, an argument for the encouragement of capital goods&#13;
of low quality per se, but for capital goods embodying simpler specifi-&#13;
cations and performance levels.&#13;
/3 Relative to the average DC firm size.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
11.       Similarly, the capital goods sector may transmit valuable external&#13;
economies to other sectors: (a) capital goods production activity may create&#13;
pools of skilled labor proficient in repair work. This may increase efficiency&#13;
in the user industries: downtimes may be reduced, and the purchase of second-&#13;
hand equipment /1 accommodated, thereby allowing LDCs to gain access to a&#13;
wider spectrum of available techniques; (b) the consequent increase in&#13;
engineering skills may encourage the indigenous planning and setting up of&#13;
production (e.g., as in turnkey projects), and also accommodate an increase&#13;
in the domestic procurement of capital goods by improving the economy's&#13;
ability to translate and match equipment norms to indigenous production&#13;
conditions/capabilities; (c) capital goods production by facilitating the&#13;
introduction of modern technological/organizational systems of factory&#13;
management could influence the speed of innovation within the sector, and the&#13;
efficiency of client industries.&#13;
Part II: The Efficiency of Capital Goods Production: Possible Constraints&#13;
and Choices&#13;
Factors Affecting Static Efficiency&#13;
12.       Since the factors which determine the efficiency of capital goods&#13;
production have much to do with the special attributes which distinguish the&#13;
industry from the consumer goods and process industries, it is important to&#13;
point to these features at the very outset. These characteristics relate not&#13;
merely to the extreme diversity of products, or the varied production sequences&#13;
available for the manufacture of the same end-product, but also to the preva-&#13;
lence of "interdependencies in capital goods production": the malleability in&#13;
use of each piece of capital equipment, the possibilities of grouping diverse&#13;
end-products for processing on the same machine or in the same production&#13;
operation, and the heightened scope for complementarities between specific&#13;
factors of production. The importance of these interdependencies derives in&#13;
the main from the typically lumpy nature of the equipment and skills used in&#13;
machinery production, and the consequent need to effect scale economies. To&#13;
facilitate exposition, however, we shall deal with these interdependencies in&#13;
LDC machinery production in terms of their influence on the major elements of&#13;
the cost structure: labor, material inputs, and capital and overhead factors.&#13;
Labor&#13;
13.       Current cost comparisons (for the same machine design) between&#13;
LDCs and DCs reveal that the LDC comparative advantage in machine production&#13;
generally lies in labor use, despite the higher labor intensities of production&#13;
usually observed in LDCs. The advantage derives in general from the relatively&#13;
low LDC wage levels, rather than from high physical labor productivity, for&#13;
despite commendable levels of operator efficiency per machine task, plant&#13;
output per man-hour in LDCs is usually lower than in DCs.&#13;
/1 Performance norms are sometimes difficult to re-establish after relocation&#13;
of the equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv -&#13;
14.       Where labor productivity per machine task is observed to be low, it&#13;
may be due to the following reasons:&#13;
(a) the quality of skills available (even in middle-income LDCs) may&#13;
not be adequate for, or wholly appropriate to, the needs of capital&#13;
goods production; and&#13;
(b) the lower performance standards may be due to poor training, and&#13;
to the commonly observed predilection of firms to train only for&#13;
specific rather than for a wide range of machine tasks, a consequence&#13;
of the divergence between private and social net benefits.&#13;
15.       Lower plant-wide worker productivity may be due to a number of&#13;
causes outside the plant's control, e.g., poor raw material quality and supply&#13;
inelasticities, economy-wide incentive systems which militate against factory&#13;
discipline, etc., but the available studies also document the effects of poor&#13;
management - in terms of poor plant layout and flow of work, inadequate pro-&#13;
duction scheduling, inventory control, and planning of auxiliary activities,&#13;
etc. - on plant output per man-hour. However, it is important to point out&#13;
that the crude copying of DC management norms does not guarantee performance&#13;
standards in LDCs: adaptation of modern production-cum-organizational techniques&#13;
to the requirements (and qualities) of other complementary factors available&#13;
in LDCs appears to be crucial.&#13;
Material Inputs&#13;
16.       The most common inputs consist of special steels, castings, forgings&#13;
and components.&#13;
17.       Steel supply problems in LDC machine production usually stem from&#13;
the poor quality of supplies, and from the limited range of specialty steels&#13;
available. They are exacerbated, however, by LDC attempts to effect import&#13;
substitution in steel production: the application of a protective trade&#13;
regime usually encourages prices to rise above international levels; attempts&#13;
to phase the steel sector's construction and production plans with those of&#13;
the machine-building sectors often starve the capital goods sectors of&#13;
essential raw materials.&#13;
18.       Castings, Forgings and Component Manufacture.    The widely observed&#13;
supply inefficiencies in these areas are usually a consequence of poor&#13;
material supplies (e.g., of pig iron, steel and sand used in foundry activities),&#13;
inadequate technical standards and know-how, and organizational problems.&#13;
The latter stem largely from decisions regarding the extent of subcontracting&#13;
of component manufacture and the degree of specialization considered feasible&#13;
for LDC foundry and forge operations. The problems associated with high&#13;
rejection rates, the pooling of demands from disparate machinery producers&#13;
(for the purpose of capturing scale economies), the scheduling of shipments,&#13;
etc., which arise in the case of specialized component/casting production,&#13;
are often so overwhelming that the decision to specialize (and therefore to&#13;
exploit scale economies adequately) is often abandoned in favor of vertically&#13;
integrated machine-building operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
v&#13;
Capital and Overheads&#13;
19.       The efficiency of capital use in the equipment-producing industries&#13;
hinges on three related factors: (a) The first relates to the need to spread&#13;
indivisible investment capacities over large volumes of output. Scale economies&#13;
are, however, not so much a function of the total investment volume per plant,&#13;
but of the capacity installed for the production of an individual product, and&#13;
ultimately of the length of run or "batch size" per individual mark ne.      In the&#13;
progression of plant scale possibilities (from organization according to&#13;
"one-off," through "series" to "mass production") efficiency tends to increase&#13;
when the product range is limited and output per product increased, and when&#13;
bottlenecks/excess capacities are overcome through the subcontracting of&#13;
component manufacture or through the adoption of specialization by process.&#13;
(b) The organizational implications of production where scale economies are&#13;
sought to be ensured are not trivial. Aside from the decision to specialize,&#13;
the correct choice of equipment, the identification of common parts/sub-&#13;
assemblies per machine operation, the possibilities for "capacity sharing,"&#13;
the particular mode of production organization (e.g., according to whether&#13;
production is by "series" on general-purpose machines, or by "mass" on&#13;
special-purpose machine tools arranged in continuous flow lines) have important&#13;
implications for the requirements of labor skills, materials handling&#13;
capacity, inventory scheduling, quality control, etc. (c) For an LDC setting&#13;
up production, the complexity of the decisions, the imperatives of scale, the&#13;
seductiveness of the "latest technology", and the bias towards capital&#13;
intensity induced by the pattern of tax and interest rate subsidies generally&#13;
prevalent in LDCs, usually tilt the investment decision in favor of new&#13;
investments in large size plants, and against the alternative of upgrading&#13;
existing capacity. Inevitably, and as a further consequence, the range of&#13;
buy-out decisions is restricted through the in-house installation of critical&#13;
capacities. The large-sized capacities installed, the restricted use of&#13;
subcontracting, and the inexperience of the new firm in production and&#13;
capacity scheduling, usually lead to decisions to extend the range of products&#13;
(to exploit installed capacities). This reduces the range of output per&#13;
product per firm in the restricted LDC market, and sets in motion a sequence&#13;
of developments which work against the logic of scale economies (by product&#13;
line), and of specialization.&#13;
20.       The available evidence for India, Brazil and Korea, for example,&#13;
confirms the tendency towards large firm size, the prevalence of inadequate&#13;
scales in individual product lines, and the existence of trends towards&#13;
product diversification as an answer to problems associated with capacity&#13;
utilization.&#13;
21.       To sum up, an appraisal of the factors which determine the current&#13;
efficiency of LDC capital goods production suggests that a number of simple&#13;
but carefully orchestrated measures taken at the shop floor level,      to&#13;
improve labor skills, plant layout, quality of materials and parts inputs,&#13;
operating and maintenance practices, tooling usage, product and materials&#13;
testing facilities, scheduling, etc., might serve to raise performance&#13;
levels and current capabilities in LDCs.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- vii -&#13;
could be garnered by the DC innovator through the medium of technology&#13;
transfer arrangements, as against those which could be secured through export&#13;
to the particular LDC as well as to the LDC's potential export markets.&#13;
Moreover, in the case of a new innovation, technology transfer is usually&#13;
accompanied by prohibitions on LDC exports.&#13;
27.       Third, the resource costs of technology tranfer, encompassing the&#13;
physical items which embody the technology (e.g. blueprints, tooling) as well&#13;
as the know-how in the form of support engineering and adaptive activities,&#13;
are apt to be high for machinery technology transfer. The resource costs of&#13;
transfer are particularly high for "leading edge" technology which is charac-&#13;
terized by "few applications, a short elapsed time since development, and&#13;
limited diffusion," and are determined closely by the size, and technical and&#13;
managerial experience of the transferee. It is possible that the frequent&#13;
adoption of the technology transfer route by LDCs is due in part to an&#13;
inadequate appreciation of the magnitude of the associated transfer costs.&#13;
28.       A large part of the explanation for the paucity of LDC design&#13;
innovations may lie in the joint operation of an array of factors such as&#13;
the general application of import substitution regimes, oligopolistic market&#13;
structures, etc., which induce LDCs to opt for the stability of market shares&#13;
and for satisficing behaviour. It is only when competitors attempt to increase&#13;
market shares that LDC firms attempt to counter with design improvements.&#13;
In these circumstances foreign technology purchase appears to be a quicker&#13;
and surer route to product innovation than indigenous R&amp;D.&#13;
29.       The small size of the market for the existing design provides yet&#13;
another explanation. The restricted LDC market limits learning, restricts&#13;
scale economies in research, and accentuates the divergence between the&#13;
private and social benefits and costs associated with innovative effort.&#13;
Part III: The Case for State Intervention&#13;
30.       The case for state intervention in the mechanical engineering        )&#13;
industries rests -on three factors: (a) The operation of externalities; (b) the&#13;
relevance of infant industry arguments; and (c) the efficacy of planning in&#13;
reducing uncertainty.&#13;
(a)  Externalities&#13;
31.       It was pointed out that individual LDC plants undertake less&#13;
than the optimum degree of labor training to minimize losses induced by the&#13;
pirating of labor by competing firms. This works against increases in "labor&#13;
productivity." There appears to be a strong case, therefore, for government&#13;
programs for direct vocational training, for the subsidization or organiza-&#13;
tion of self-financed schemes of in-plant training, or for training through&#13;
the operation of multiple shift work.&#13;
32.       Part II pointed out that plant efficiency in labor use, materials&#13;
use, and management arrangements for the exploitation of scale economies&#13;
through subcontracting, and the choice of systems of know-how and management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- viii -&#13;
which are appropriate to LDC factor endowments, could be improved signi-&#13;
ficantly "if technical expertise on production were available to management."&#13;
Large firms may possess resources for the hiring of such know-how but small&#13;
firms generally do not. A case therefore exists for the organization of a&#13;
government program for the dissemination of pre-investment technical know-how,&#13;
for technical assistance in "best practices," and for the organization and&#13;
systematization of technical information. Similar gains are likely to result&#13;
from the organization of centralized engineering consultancy services,&#13;
particularly for the conception, setting up, and operation of turnkey&#13;
plants. An associated need relates to the establishment of nation-wide&#13;
standards for the mechanical engineering industries and for determining the&#13;
appropriate timing for a switch to systems of standardized fasteners, tooling&#13;
(and some types of parts) and for the production of these standardized parts&#13;
and tools in specialized plants. These steps would confer benefits which&#13;
individual plants acting atomistically would be unable to attain.&#13;
33.       Private calculations of returns and risk restrict indigenous&#13;
industriai R&amp;D and LDC export efforts in international capital goods&#13;
markets. The external economy argument therefore buttresses the case for&#13;
government support of R&amp;D (through tax and other incentives, contract&#13;
research, encouraging the pooling of private efforts, etc.) and Governments'&#13;
attempts to organize or support large-scale marketing efforts for LDC&#13;
machinery exports.&#13;
(b) Infant Industry Arguments&#13;
34.       Part II pointed to the need for large volumes of output for the&#13;
spreading of overhead costs and for learning.   In LDCs characterized by small&#13;
markets it is therefore important to reserve the domestic market for domestic&#13;
producers, and to enlarge the total market by encouraging exports. The first&#13;
step is usually sought to be ensured by outright prohibitions or quotas.&#13;
However, since this introduces inefficiencies in the equipment-using industries&#13;
through the restriction of the choice set, more preferable policy tools&#13;
appear to be the imposition of tariffs or the direct subsidization of&#13;
production for limited periods (long enough for learning to be effected).&#13;
Interest rate subsidies which are in use in certain LDCs are less appealing&#13;
because they encourage the use of capital relative to labor.    One variant of&#13;
the interest rate subsidy is the provision of overhead services at subsidized&#13;
rates. Government programs to encourage exports (including the operation of&#13;
free trade areas, joint LDC production facilities, etc.) would serve the dual&#13;
purpose of enlarging the market, encouraging quality improvements and ensuring&#13;
international competitiveness.&#13;
35.       Part II outlined the importance of learning and of the adoption of&#13;
technologies and organizational modes which are in keeping with LDC factor&#13;
endowments. Learning appears to be facilitated by the adoption of machine&#13;
designs where the intrinsic properties of the machine (rather than its&#13;
special features) are important, and by high volumes of cumulative output.&#13;
These learning effects are important to bear in mind for LDCs where foreign&#13;
technology imports are monitored or where technical assistance programs are&#13;
organized to help small firms choose apprcpriate techniques. Again LDC&#13;
licensing and investment monitoring authorities tend invariably to mistake&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ix -&#13;
large firm size for large individual product volume. It is important&#13;
therefore, to ensure that individual machine markets are not fragmented by&#13;
government licensing policy, that government-subsidized funds flow to small&#13;
(subcontractors) as well as to large-sized firms, and that funds flow not&#13;
only to the new but also to the old existing firms which, by operating large&#13;
runs, can exploit their accumulated experience.&#13;
(c) The Reduction of Uncertainty&#13;
36.       The establishment of the lumpy investments which characterize&#13;
machinery production, the full utilization of equipment and the concomitant&#13;
adoption of efficient forms of technical organization, subcontracting, etc.&#13;
are predicated on the stability of demand for the LDC equipment sector's&#13;
current product mix. Therefore some degree of indicative macro planning&#13;
appears to be warranted to ensure the availability of prior information on&#13;
the timing of investments in the domestic equipment-using sectors and the&#13;
planned phasing of the raw material-producing sectors with the mechanical&#13;
engineering industries.&#13;
37.       The need for stable demand patterns translates itself into an&#13;
argument for a stable rate of growth, since the growth of the mechanical&#13;
engineering sector is determined by the growth rate of the economy. Hence&#13;
governments contemplating economy-wide stabilization policies must concomit-&#13;
tantly draw up measures for the support of the engineering industries&#13;
if recession is to be averted.&#13;
38.       An additional rationale for sector and subsector planning (whether&#13;
funded by government or by private industry) derives from the very complexity&#13;
of the production decisions involved in capital goods manufacture: equipment&#13;
producers should have a better framework for determining trade-offs and for&#13;
sharpening perceptions than their "traditional bookkeeping framework of&#13;
aggregate financial transactions." A related service would consist of the&#13;
acquisition, processing and dissemination of international marketing informa-&#13;
tion which is "critically important" for determining the optimum degree of&#13;
"product differentiation" for exports.&#13;

The Capital Goods Sector in LDCs: A Case for State Intervention? /1&#13;
Introduction&#13;
This study attempts to explore three questions relating to the&#13;
development of capital goods production in LDCs. Its first concern (elabora-&#13;
ted in Part I) is to examine the case for setting up mechanical engineering&#13;
production facilities in developing countries. Part II attempts to identify&#13;
and evaluate, in the context of the available empirical evidence, the con-&#13;
straints which mar the efficiency of capital goods production. Some of these&#13;
bottlenecks work against the full exploitation of a sector's current capabil-&#13;
ities, thereby reducing the current static efficiency of capital goods&#13;
production; yet other constraints are important in the context of a dynamic&#13;
framework where the ability to innovate is important for continued competi-&#13;
tiveness. The study then attempts in Part III to draw up the case for govern-&#13;
ment policies which might aid in nurturing the mechanical engineering&#13;
industries in LDCs. The evidence which the study attempts to marshal is&#13;
unfortunately somewhat anecdotal and sporadic in its coverage./2 This is&#13;
partly because the number of LDCs following self-conscious policies of&#13;
capital goods industry development has till recently been fairly small.&#13;
Moreover, the focus of discussions on industrial policies in even these&#13;
countries has tended more to the general questions of import substitution and&#13;
export promotion than to the particularities of capital goods industries per&#13;
se. This was true, for example, in India, Brazil and Mexico. Again, as in the&#13;
case of the genre of development literature relating to the issue of choice&#13;
of techniques in LDCs, the sparseness of discussion is due perhaps also to&#13;
the importance of, and the economists' unfamiliarity with, some of the&#13;
engineering dimensions of capital goods production./3&#13;
I. The Rationale for Capital Goods Production in LDCs&#13;
Constraints on Imports. The most generally heard argument in favor&#13;
of capital goods production in LDCs runs in terms of their contribution to&#13;
the growth process. In economies where balance of payments difficulties&#13;
/1 I am greatly indebted to Howard Pack. As the numerous footnotes indicate,&#13;
I have drawn extensively on his unpublished paper "The Capital Goods&#13;
Sector in LDCs: A Survey," 1978.&#13;
/2  I have attempted to illustrate the propositions set out in this study,&#13;
by examples from the empirical literature on Brazil, India, Mexico,&#13;
Argentina, and the Republics of Korea and China. I have also referred&#13;
extensively to the experience of the Soviet Union during the period&#13;
1927-37, when it was grappling with precisely the same sets of problems&#13;
as those LDCs which are currently attempting to establish capital goods&#13;
production.&#13;
/3 The Soviet Union, however, appears to be a striking exception. The&#13;
literature on Soviet industrialization during the period 1927-37&#13;
appears to display a very keen understanding of the economic cum&#13;
engineering issues involved. Also remarkable was the Soviet-willing-&#13;
ness to experiment with alternative modes of production organization&#13;
(specialization by product and specialization by process) and concomi-&#13;
tantly with series production and mass production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
impose limits on imports of capital goods, the expansion of domest,c capital&#13;
goods production is seen as the means of overcoming the pcoolLfli of trans.&#13;
forming savings into inveatment and accelerating growth0    Indeed, in several&#13;
LDCs the products of the machinery sector constitute the single mo5t important&#13;
component of gross fixed capital formation (e.g. 41% in (orea in lS77), and&#13;
at the same time contribute a very large share to th2 total import 'oill: 27%&#13;
of total Korean imports in 1977 consisted of machinery and zquipme.a;&#13;
capital goods contributed 49% to Indian imports of manufacturas in 1.976.&#13;

principal industrial nations: the European Economic Community, Canada, Japan&#13;
and the United States. While one of the major avowed targets of these&#13;
measures was Japan, the concentration of the restrictive measures on textiles,&#13;
clothing, footwear, shipbuilding, steel, electrical consumer goods, elec-&#13;
tronics and other miscellaneous manufactures, has meant that the restrictive&#13;
trade measures will have quite far-reaching implications for a wide range of&#13;
developing countries. Not only are the current exporters of these products&#13;
3everely hit, the measures have also dealt a blow to those LDCs which were&#13;
gearing up for the exploitation of potential comparative advantage opportu-&#13;
nities in the affected sectors. Thus the resurgence of protectionism has hit&#13;
not merely the three major East Asian exporters - Hong Kong, the Republic of&#13;
Korea, and the Republic of China (ROC), which together account for about one&#13;
third of LDC manufactured exports and which market over 60% of their textile&#13;
and clothing exports (comprising the bulk of their manufactured exports) to&#13;
the industrial countries - but also LDCs with somewhat more diversified&#13;
industrial structures: Brazil, India, Mexico and Argentina; the newly&#13;
emerging LDC exporters: Colombia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand and&#13;
Turkey; and even countries at relatively lower levels of development:&#13;
Bangladesh, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. The curbs on traditional LDC exports&#13;
(textiles, footwear) point to the need for restructuring export baskets and&#13;
production, both within individual LDCs and between LDCs.&#13;
Indeed, the three major East Asian exporters are looking to their&#13;
machinery industries to fulfill the role of leading sector in their future&#13;
export strategies. Brazil, Mexico and India, though somewhat less dependent&#13;
on exports of textiles and clothing (these export categories constitute&#13;
between one quarter and one third of their total manufactured exports, as&#13;
opposed to Korea's one third), are also attempting to rely on non-traditional&#13;
engineering products to register expansions in their manufactured export&#13;
totals. For the newly emerging exporters (Colombia, Malaysia, Morocco,&#13;
etc.) the expansion of their traditional exports will depend not only on&#13;
movements in their own wage-productivity indicators, relative to trends in&#13;
competing LDCs, but also on the degree to which the established exporters&#13;
diversify. They, too, will need to explore possible comparative advantage&#13;
opportunities in the light engineering sectors, and to determine whether the&#13;
time is ripe for laying the groundwork for a more substantial development of&#13;
their machinery industries in the future. The case for capital goods produc-&#13;
tion is strengthened by the fact that mechanical engineering goods /1 exports&#13;
are not yet subject to trade restrictions; that developed country market&#13;
penetration by LDCs is still at an early stage (if Korean penetration of the&#13;
US market can be considered a guide);/2 that LDC machinery exports by virtue&#13;
of their relative skill intensity do not pose a threat to the continued&#13;
employment in developed countries of unskilled labor - the group which&#13;
appears to enjoy little mobility between industries;/3 and finally that&#13;
/1   Save for electronics products, electrical household appliances, ship-&#13;
building, which in the UN trade classification are grouped with&#13;
capital goods (i.e. in SITC group 7).&#13;
/2   See Tables 2A, 2B, 2C for Korean shares in imports of machinery&#13;
into the US, Japan and Germany (Federal Republic).&#13;

sentiment in DCs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
within the category of LDC non-traditional exports, capital goods have&#13;
registered one of the fastest growth rates in recent years.&#13;
Changing Comparative Advantage among LDCs. Though comparable data&#13;
are somewhat difficult to muster, recent economic trends in individual middle-&#13;
income developing countries (Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, Turkey, Yugoslavia,&#13;
Argentina and Brazil) suggest that the process of LDC export diversification&#13;
may receive an additional impetus from the potential loss of competitiveness&#13;
in traditional export areas, which may have been induced by the sor what&#13;
rapid rise in wage rates in some of these economies. [Between 1972 and 1976,&#13;
for example, the nominal wages for urban production workers and for manufac-&#13;
turing workers rose by 254% and 288% respectively in Korea, compared to&#13;
increases of 126% and 145% in the Philippines (Manila and suburbs) and&#13;
Thailand, respectively./1] Unless the effects of wage increases are compen-&#13;
sated for by increases in labor productivity (and/or declines in other input&#13;
costs), the middle-income LDCs are likely to face severe competition from the&#13;
newly emerging exporters such as Colombia, Thailand, the Philippines and&#13;
Malaysia.&#13;
Expanding World Trade in Capital Goods.   Recent trends in LDC&#13;
exports do in fact herald the move to greater concentration on capital goods&#13;
exports. While growth rates of traditional manufactured exports from LDCs&#13;
have been remarkable over the period 1972-76 (clothing exports from developing&#13;
market economies,/2 for example, have grown at the rate of about 32% in&#13;
current terms), the performance of LDC exports of machinery (category SITC 7)&#13;
was as remarkable.  For the group of developing market economies the growth&#13;
rate registered in current prices was about 35% over the same period. This&#13;
has been responsible for the changing composition of LDC-manufactured exports.&#13;
Exports of machinery and equipment from developing market economies /3&#13;
comprised 19% of their total manufactured /4 exports in 1972; by 1976 their&#13;
share had risen to 23%. Moreover, the share of developing market economies&#13;
in world trade in machinery also rose from 2.3% in 1972 to 3.4% in 1976 (see&#13;
Table 1)./5&#13;
- A further disaggregation of the LDC export picture by geographical&#13;
destination suggests that LDC machinery exports have indeed been&#13;
exploiting the most important growth markets for equipment imports.&#13;
Penetration of both the Japanese and US markets (the two largest&#13;
importers of capital goods) appears to have proceeded apace: the&#13;
shares of developing market economies in total US and Japanese imports&#13;
of machinery appear to have risen from 6% to 9% and from 4% to 16%&#13;
/1 For Manila and suburbs, the statistic refers to the trend in unskilled&#13;
labor wage rates in the period 1972-76; for Thailand, it refers to the&#13;
manufacturing wage trend over 1972-75. These data are presented only to&#13;
convey a rough idea of wage trends; definitions, coverage and accuracy&#13;
may vary widely'between countries.&#13;

74 Defined as SITC categories 5, 6, 7 and 8, excluding 68.&#13;
/5 Admittedly the expansion of electronics exports played a large part in&#13;
the growth of LDC capital goods exports, but some degree of diversification&#13;
has been taking place. See the following para.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
respectively, over the period 1972-76 (see Table 1). A look at the&#13;
commodity composition of LDC machinery exports to developed coun-&#13;
tries /1 confirms that the bulk of the exports is concentrated in&#13;
relatively low technology/labor-intensive lines of manufacture, e.g.,&#13;
office machines, telecommunications equipment, sewing machines and&#13;
automotive equipment. These are obviously areas in which DC compara-&#13;
tive advantage is beginning to diminish because of the high labor&#13;
content of production. The evidence does, however, point to some&#13;
progress in the diversification of LDC exports into more complex lines&#13;
of industrial machinery. Despite the decline in world trade in 1975,&#13;
Brazil registered exports of textile equipment, paper and pulp-making&#13;
machinery, construction and mining equipment, and power transformers&#13;
to the US and Europe; Argentina exported mechanical handling and&#13;
packaging machinery to Europe; India, machine tools and pumps to the&#13;
US and Western Europe; and Singapore, exports of ball and roller&#13;
bearings, construction and mining equipment, pumps and centrifuges,&#13;
powered tools and mechanical handling equipment. Though these exports&#13;
were admittedly of low volume and somewhat sporadic (see Tables 2B, 2C&#13;
and 3), and despite the fact that some of the capital goods exports are&#13;
in the nature of durable consumer goods and the production processes&#13;
involved are either assembly operations or relatively simple technolo-&#13;
gically, the data imply that a beginning has been made in production&#13;
(and marketing) and that it may be possible either to integrate&#13;
backwards from these end-products to more sophisticated lines of&#13;
capital goods manufacture, or to expand the products available to&#13;
include machines with more complex specifications or finer tolerances.&#13;
The evidence suggests that the Republic of China, for example, integ-&#13;
rated backwards from the production of sewing machines, agricultural&#13;
machinery, bicycles and textile equipment, into the production of&#13;
machine tools, while the Argentinian auto industry had a significant&#13;
impact on the development of the machine tool industry./2 This was&#13;
also the pattern in the US, where the development of the machine tool&#13;
industry derived great impetus from the prior expansion of the small&#13;
arms, sewing machine, bicycle, and automobile industries./3&#13;
- An even faster growing market for LDC machinery exports has been the&#13;
developing countries themselves; the 1972-76 growth rate of exports to&#13;
developing country destinations was about 39% compared to an overall&#13;
LDC manufactured exports growth rate of about 35% (see Table 1, and also&#13;
Tables 4A and 4B).&#13;
The "Appropriateness" Argument. This faster growth rate is often&#13;
rationalized in terms of the greater "appropriateness" of LDC exports in&#13;
meeting LDC needs.&#13;
/1 See Table 3. Here again, the rubric "capital goods" encompasses all&#13;
machinery listed under SITC 7.&#13;
/2 See Cortes, Mariluz: "Argentina; Technical Development and Technology&#13;
Exports to Other LDCs," IBRD Draft (Mimeo), March 1978, p. 34.&#13;
/3  Rosenberg, N:   "Technological Change in the Machine Tool Industry,&#13;
1840-1910," Journal of Economic History, December 1963.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- One variant of this idea is an offshoot of the hypothesis that income&#13;
levels in LDCs determine the quality of final products consumed, and&#13;
the latter in turn determine the quality of the capital goods required&#13;
to produce the final consumer goods, eog., the quality of 6teel&#13;
utensils used in India does not require the use of special purpose&#13;
machine tools of strict tolerances. The concept of "appropriateness"&#13;
bears further elucidation however0   One concomitant cf the Idea&#13;
(though it is difficult to substantiate TigoTously) is that :iDC demand&#13;
schedules may be more sensitive to price than DC demsnd schedules for&#13;
the corresponding class of producto/1 This in turn suggests two&#13;
alternative norms for production. The equipment produced ir the LDC&#13;
may simply be an earlier or less sophisticsted or scaled-down version&#13;
(though by no means inferior in performance for specific puTposes) of&#13;
a machine currently produced in the DCs (eogoD a straighlt sttch&#13;
sewing machine, bicycles with no gears) or it may simply embody poorer&#13;
quality specifications0 In both cases costs and prices may have been&#13;
lowered relative to DC levels to achieve competitiveness in LDC&#13;
markets0  It is important to emphasize at this point, however, that&#13;
the latter route, the lowering of price vla the sacrifice of quality&#13;
specifications to suit current LDC market requireme2ats, does not&#13;
appear to be the appropriate route for growth0 Exports of low quality&#13;
LDC equipment are apt to be especially vulnerable to competition from&#13;
domestic equipment of similar lot quality and produced in other&#13;
LDCs0/2  The market for such loaquality products tends to be income=&#13;
inelastic, and is apt to diminish wyith the process of groith; further,&#13;
the memory of low performance is difficult to erase in a martet in&#13;
which, relative to consumer goods. quality is ultiDately an important&#13;
attributeO Thus3, as the ROC and Korean equipent industries&#13;
demonstrate, it is the quality end of the asrket which holds out the&#13;
promiae of faster technological advance and faster growtho Consider-&#13;
ations of dynamic efficiency therefore Ergue against the sacrifice of&#13;
qualityo&#13;
Within the clEas of capital goods, LDC firms tend aslo to produce&#13;
machinery which ic more in line with LDC relative factor endowments0&#13;
bmsden /3 cites the case of the successful exports of machine&#13;
tools from the Republic of China to the Philippines0    ROC equipment&#13;
minimized investment outlays in the short run; given the lazbor intensity&#13;
of ROC equipment relative to that of the higher priced (higher quality)&#13;
machine tools available from other sources1  R8C equipaent inimized&#13;
total costs over the life of the machine1, as well0&#13;
Given that the type of machine equipment lnstalled determines the nature&#13;
of the production process (eogo., whether one-off1, series or mass&#13;
production, to use a convenient classification), the use of LDC&#13;
/   ]oth (price) intercept and slope may be lower0&#13;
/2 At the low quality end of the machine tool markLnet, foreign&#13;
iaports were not able to compete on price terms against domestic equipment&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
equipment is more likely to dictate production skill requirements&#13;
(managerial, engineering, and labor) which are likely to be better&#13;
suited to LDC skill availabilities. The Soviet /1 attempt to arrive&#13;
at appropriate organizational norms in the metal-working industries&#13;
during the First Plan provides an interesting case in point. The&#13;
planners attempted to match labor demands to availabilities by&#13;
adopting production organization techniques (i.e. continuous flow&#13;
methods) which would use semi-skilled labor intensively and economize&#13;
on the use of skilled labor. This need to observe the imperatives of&#13;
the "appropriateness" concept is a theme which recurs later in yet&#13;
other contexts.&#13;
Factor Endowments. An additional argument in favor of equipment&#13;
production is that the capital goods sector, even in DCs, is labor-intensive,&#13;
specifically skilled-labor-intensive./2 A number of LDCs: the Republic of&#13;
China, Korea, Hong Kong, particular regions in India, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina&#13;
and Malaysia have a substantial pool of skilled workers /3 and/or of trained&#13;
engineers and technicians. Unless the wage advantage is nullified by lower&#13;
labor productivities, the wage costs in these countries should confer a&#13;
competitive advantage in machinery production and marketing./4 A corollary&#13;
of this argument is that the incidence of machine production as between LDCs&#13;
(conditions with respect to other factors such as capital supply being equal)&#13;
will largely be a function of the relative endowments of skilled and unskilled&#13;
labor of competing LDCs.&#13;
Considerations of Firm Size. The size structure of firms in the&#13;
capital goods industries of DCs also reinforces the case for machine production&#13;
in LDCs. The skeptics hold that. owing to capital supply constraints, prevailing&#13;
organizational practices and norms etc., equipment-producing firms in LDCs&#13;
are typically small relative to DC firms. They point out further that equip-&#13;
ment production is characterized by very large-scale economies deriving mainly&#13;
from the lumpy investments embodied in industrial machines, as well as the&#13;
high set-up times for specific machine processes based on series operations:&#13;
efficiency considerations therefore dictate the large-scale production of a&#13;
restricted range of machine types per firm, and for each machine type, when&#13;
the logic of specialization is carried to its limit, they also suggest the&#13;
subdivision of operations down to the point where the mass output of a single&#13;
machine item or component is achieved on a single machine. This minimizes&#13;
down-times, and set-up times (via a high degree of tooling), reduces the&#13;
required amount of materials handling and even the need for frequent re-&#13;
scheduling. Thus the logic of large-scale operations seems inevitably to&#13;
/1 Granick, David., Soviet Metal-Fabricating and Economic Development. The&#13;
University of Wisconsin Press, 1967, Chapter 3.&#13;
/2 The literature on comparative advantage usually runs in terms of two fac-&#13;
tors, labor and capital. This tends to obscure the fact that the ineffi-&#13;
ciency of material input use often jeopardizes the competitiveness of LDC&#13;
machinery exports. We discuss this point later.&#13;
/3 See, however, Part II for the caveats to the arguuent about skilled labor&#13;
availabilities in LDCs.&#13;

of coexistence of large and small firms (classified by s:ze of employment)0/l&#13;
Indeed a close look at the product structure of fiL.bis across size classes&#13;

coexistence of firms covering the whole Gpectrum o.- 5ize clasesO     The&#13;
imperatives of scale (generated by the need to spread high volumes of output&#13;
across large individual machine capacities) may hazv    pzecipitated the breaking&#13;

entities: thus the subcontracting of parts and cowiponents ';o separ2t2 3UpplieT&#13;
firms, and the existence of small firms producing high volumes of output of&#13;
individual items/products, may be a logical outcome of the nature of the&#13;
technical operations involved in machine productioa. Pack /2 points out,&#13;
further, that the established pattern of coerz½stence of smZafT and large fi£rm&#13;

Batala (Punjab, India), Coimbatore and Madras (in Tamil Nadu,&#13;
India), or in Incheon (near Seoul, Korea) were in fact facilities&#13;
for the repair of machinery and of consumer durables.&#13;
(b) The skills generated in the process of capital goods production may&#13;
be useful in machinery-using sectors where the continuity of&#13;
machine utilization may be jeopardized by the nonavailability of&#13;
repair and maintenance personnel./l Further, greater acquaintance&#13;
with machine construction may increase the range of options avail-&#13;
able for machinery purchase by LDCs: the repair of LDC machines&#13;
may be more easily done by LDC repairmen familiar with LDC construc-&#13;
tion norms, and this in turn may broaden the spectrum of machine de-&#13;
signs which might be adopted, or the sources of LDC technology which&#13;
could be tapped; the purchase of second-hand equipment may be more&#13;
feasible because start-up problems (performance norms are diffi-&#13;
cult to reestablish /2 when equipment has been moved to a new&#13;
environment) may be reduced due to the availability of adequate&#13;
repair and maintenance men familiar with the technology embodied in&#13;
older vintages of imported machinery.&#13;
(c) An associated type of skill which equipment production might help to&#13;
foster is the engineering skills required, not so much for production,&#13;
but for the planning and setting up of production: the engineering&#13;
consultancy groups which are required for the choice of technology&#13;
and equipment, the planning and phasing of construction (and&#13;
operation), the laying down of norms for the flow of work, inventory&#13;
control, etc., and to translate and match equipment norms to&#13;
indigenous conditions/capabilities. The costs of such services&#13;
could form a significant share of set-up costs for plants estab-&#13;
lished in LDCs. A recent check on the cost components of Japanese&#13;
turnkey plant exports to the Middle East revealed that engineering&#13;
costs, despite scale economies and considerable Japanese experience&#13;
in the field, were in the range of 10-15% for power generation,&#13;
petrochemical and cement plants and for iron and steel mills./3&#13;
(d) A further externality which capital goods production in LDCs might&#13;
confer on the rest of the economy, is related to the creation of&#13;
yet another form of intangible capital: namely a modern technologi-&#13;
cal organizational system of factory management. -As we shall see in&#13;
Part II, improved managerial efficiency is likely to affect not only&#13;
the current costs of the equipment-producing sectors, but also to&#13;
forco the pace of learning, and therefore the speed and quality of&#13;
improvements/innovation in machine production. This, in turn, is&#13;
likely to influence significantly the current as well as the future&#13;
efficiency of the equipment industry's client sectors.&#13;

IIo The Efficiency of Capital Goods Production: Possible Constraints&#13;
and Choices&#13;
Special Characteristics of the Industry&#13;
Before we enumerate the principal factors which appear to determine&#13;
the efficiency of capital goods production in LDCs, it might be well to&#13;
delineate those characteristics of mechanical engineering production or&#13;
technology which distinguish it from consumer goods production, or ! om&#13;
process industries./l The complexities of mechanical engineering goods&#13;
production are due not merely to the extreme diversity of products, or the&#13;
varied production sequences which may be adopted for the same end-product&#13;
(these complexities also characterize some process industries), but also&#13;
by the malleability in use of capital equLpment: each piece of mechanical&#13;
equipment can usually be used to produce multiple products0 Further, seemingly&#13;
diverse end-products may be broken down into component parts or subassemblies&#13;
in such a fashion that it is possible to form groups of common components&#13;
which might be machined together on the same piece of equipment0 Alternatively&#13;
the production process Ltself can be broken up into subprocesses such as&#13;
casting or forging operations so that disparate end-products can be&#13;
jointly processed in the same facility0 The importance of these so-called&#13;
interdependencies /2 in mechanical engineering production arises from the&#13;
typically lumpy nature of the production equipment and the consequent need&#13;
to effect scale economies. The production decision is further complicated&#13;
by the fact that the very "upiless" of the equipment may itself be a&#13;
function of the scale of outputo0 Another set of characteristics&#13;
which are not entirely absent in particular consumer goods industries, but&#13;
appear to apply with special force in the mechanical engineering gcods&#13;
sectors, stems from the apparently greater interdependence between factors&#13;
of production: the efficiency in use of individual factors way be&#13;
subject to wider dispersion depending on the efficiency of the complementary&#13;
factors0 To put it differently, the scope for complementarities between&#13;
certain types of productive factors appears to be larger: the efficiency&#13;
of material or capital use may depend quite crucially on the efficiency of&#13;
the labor force, or the form of production organization; labor, material,&#13;
and capital productivity may be determined very closely by the firm"s planning&#13;
and management capabilitieso/3&#13;

"Industrial Investment Analysis under Increasing Returns," IBRD (mimeo)&#13;
Sept0 178, Chapter 15.&#13;
/2 A convenient term because it highlights the singular nature of the&#13;
solutions adopted in capital goods production (as opposed to those&#13;
adopted in the typical consumer goods production process) in ennuring&#13;
scale economie30 Scale economies could of course be achieved for a&#13;
given piece of equipment without resort to joint production or sharing0&#13;
/3 As we pointed out in Part I, for example, differing managerial efficiency&#13;
may explain the co-existence of very large and small firms within&#13;
particular sectors of capital goods industries in developed countries0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Factors Affecting Static Efficiency&#13;
In the section which follows, we will attempt to look beyond those&#13;
complementarities and to isolate for purposes of exposition the major elements&#13;
of the cost structure of LDC machinery production. While total cost (or&#13;
total factor productivity) is obviously determined not only by the physical&#13;
productivities of individual factors and the shares in unit cost of each&#13;
of the factors of production,/1 but also by the rentals of each factor, we&#13;
shall concentrate on the determinants of the physical productivities of&#13;
individual factors with an occasional nod at the determinants of factor&#13;
prices and the financial elements in cost. To set the scene, as it were,&#13;
we present here, data on the cost structure of a Swiss spinning machine&#13;
manufacturing firm and its Indian licensee. The comparison suffices both to&#13;
highlight the orders of magnitude involved in a breakdown of costs by factors&#13;
of production, and to point to the sources of the potential cost advantages&#13;
which LDC firms might enjoy relative to DC competitors.&#13;
/1 The following analytical construct utilized by Salter and Pack is&#13;
instructive.&#13;
p = WI + Pmm + Pkk&#13;
where W, Pm' Pk are the prices of the inputs labor, materials and&#13;
capital; 1, m and k, are the requirements for labor, materials and&#13;
capital per unit of output; and P denotes average unit cost.&#13;
dp= (dW + dl) w (dm + dPm) m + (dk + dPk) k.&#13;
p      W     1       m    Pm        k      Pk&#13;
where w, m, k are the shares in unit cost of labor, materials and&#13;
capital. Movements in dP may be taken to reflect changes in costs over&#13;
time for any particular producer or to represent the cost differential for&#13;
a particular capital good between two competing producers.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Labor: The extent of the labor cost advantage is determined by&#13;
labor productivity. Two aspects are distinguished: (a) operator efficiency&#13;
per machine task or the number of units (machine components) produced per&#13;
operator-hour, at a given machine, and (b) plant output per man-hour. The&#13;
empirical evidence, presented in several unpublished IBRD reports on the&#13;
machinery sectors of India and Korea,/l and by Leff on Brazil's capital goods&#13;
industry, suggests that operator efficiency at a given task is fairly high&#13;
and sometimes comparable to levels achieved in developed countries; plant-wide&#13;
labor efficiency, however, is usually significantly lower./2     Moreover, the&#13;
range and complexity of the factors which affect plant output per unit of&#13;
labor suggest that improvements in plant-wide efficiency may not be easy&#13;
to ensure.&#13;
(i) Labor Productivity per task&#13;
Part of the lower labor productivity per machine task in LDCs may&#13;
be due: (a) to the fact that while, as in some middle income LDCs, pools of&#13;
skilled labor (skilled relative to the needs of the traditional consumer goods&#13;
industries) do exist, the quality of skills are not sufficient for machinery&#13;
production. The skills /3 needed run in terms of the ability to read machine&#13;
designs, manipulate measurements, deal in trigonometrical concepts, etc./4.&#13;
(b) Some of the low labor productivity is due simply to poor training. Training&#13;
is often conducted with poor machine tool equipment. Complaints such as this&#13;
were heard even in India's premier machine tool plant. They were common also&#13;
in Korea. Again in the case of in-plant training, labor is often trained at&#13;
one particular machine task in order to minimize the risk and magnitude of&#13;
loss from labor turnover; however, this reduces the flexibility of the labor&#13;
/1 These unpublished reports pertain to the textile machinery, tractor,&#13;
commercial vehicle, steel forging, and foundry industries in India, and&#13;
to the machinery sector in Korea&#13;
/2  Leff seems to suggest, however, that plant-wide efficiency was not lower&#13;
in certain segments of the Brazilian capital goods sector in the 1960s,&#13;
relative to that in 'counterpart' DC factories.&#13;
/3 In other LDCs, where the available labor may possess a modicum of the&#13;
relevant skills, the "proletarianisation" of labor may not yet have&#13;
taken root. Machinery producers in established industrial areas such as&#13;
Coimbatore and Bangalore in India still complained in 1972 of the&#13;
rather significant turnover rates among skilled laborers, occasioned by&#13;
return migration to rural areas or smaller towns.&#13;
/4 The 1927-37 Soviet experience appears to have run counter to this point.&#13;
The employment of large numbers of relatively "raw" labor did not&#13;
apparently pose any additional technical constraints to the achievement&#13;
of productivity gains in the medium term. Indeed, there appear to have&#13;
been fairly large gains in productivity (of the order of 75%) within the&#13;
space of 4-5 years even in the general purpose factories which were&#13;
judged to be relatively intensive in the use of highly skilled labor.&#13;
However, it is important to point out that the recruitment of raw labor&#13;
was accompanied by extensive formal and on-the-job training, increase in&#13;
the number of work shifts, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
foras in switching between different tasks.Qe)The effects of poor training&#13;
are often compounded by the fact that the senior engineering personnel in&#13;
supervision jobs are unaware of the particular characteristics of their&#13;
machines. The unpublished IBRD Korea machinery report details the lack of&#13;
knowledge of machine capabilities - the use of wrong cutting speeds,&#13;
inappropriate cutting practices, poor tooling, the wrong use of machines,&#13;
little use of jigs and fixtures - which undermine worker efficiency.&#13;
(ii) Labor Productivity per Plant&#13;
While lower plant-wide worker productivity may in certain LDCa&#13;
be traced to causes outside the particular plant's control eOgOg, to hold-ups&#13;
in the delivery of raw material supplies   the poor quality of raw Emterials and&#13;
economy-wide incentive systems *which militate against factory discipline (all&#13;
of these characterized the Indian machine tool sector in 1972 in varying&#13;
degrees)D part of the explanation often lies in poor management. The IBRD Korea&#13;
machinery report details instances of: (a) poor plant layout and flW of work&#13;
(poor lighting, congestion, etco); (b) inadequate scheduling of production;&#13;
(c) poor inventory control; (d) inadequate planning of activities considered&#13;
auxiliary to the main production activities), e.g., conveyor systems), etc.&#13;
Similar problems appear to have characterized the Indian machine tool&#13;
scctor in 19720 The overall productivity of PraEga Hachine Tools, for example,&#13;
improved significantly following the adoption of a simple expedient: the&#13;
building of ramps to connect separate machine shops where the difference in&#13;
elevations posed problems for parts tranofer0 Inattention to auxiliary&#13;
otrmetures, and the centralization of storage facilities for parts and&#13;
CfQTRilo without adequate arrangements for regular materials delivery on a&#13;
predtetrm3lned  chedule, hampered regular production activities at the Stalin-&#13;
grad tractor plant during the first half of the 1930so /1&#13;
However, while relatively simple remedial measures can indeed effect&#13;
significant improvements in labor productivity at the margin, both at a given&#13;
machine task and plant-wide, the Soviet experience in the metnl=workhing&#13;
industries suggests that considerable experience is necessary if the impact&#13;
of specific technological-organizational systems of factory organization&#13;
on worker and overall plant performance is to be anticipated0 Soviet machine&#13;
inductry planners of the 1930s believed that it was possible to overcome&#13;
skilled labor scarcities by pushing through the adoption of the most modern&#13;
continuous flow mass production methods (practiced in the West) in which each&#13;
machine tool and operator was kept at work on only one part, or a very small&#13;
number of partso Such a production organization, which reduced the compleuity&#13;
of taeks per worker and increased the number of nachine units per supervisor,&#13;
would, it was felt, economise on the use of highly skilled workers, supervisors,&#13;
aud technical and engineering personnel, while shifting labor demand to semi-&#13;
skilled workers with general education0 However), the experiment proved&#13;
unsuccessful: there appears to have been a grave miscalculation of the&#13;
requirements of supervision and production planning, and of the heightened&#13;
need for stricter quality control at the level of each production operation&#13;
and at interprocess transfer points so as to obviate the need for repeat&#13;
operations. These requirements appear to have been greetly increased for&#13;
/1  Granick, David, opO citO, Chapter 20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
tontinuous flow operations at least partly because of the "employment of&#13;
untrained and relatively irresponsible workers" unused to factory discipline&#13;
with inadequate ability to comprehend written instructions on technical&#13;
matters, etc. In contrast, as already noted, the available evidence /1&#13;
points to the fact that the growth of (plant-wide) labor productivity was&#13;
fairly rapid (of the order of 75%) in the older, more general-purpose factories.&#13;
This suggests that the crude copying of the most modern organizational&#13;
techniques does not necessarily guarantee performance standards; experience&#13;
indicates that modern production-cum-organizational techniques, when trans-&#13;
planted to LDCs, require a considerable period of assimilation and adaptation&#13;
on home ground./2 We deal with some of these questions later in the sections&#13;
on Capital and Overheads)and Dynamic Efficiency.&#13;
Materials Inputs: The material inputs which figure significantly&#13;
in machine production include special steels, castings, forgings and&#13;
components.&#13;
(i) Steel&#13;
Steel supply problems in LDCs usually stem from their poor quality.&#13;
Consequently rejection rates are high and performance standards low relative&#13;
to those in DCs. A second area of difficulties, the limited range of specialty&#13;
steels available, is sometimes a mixed blessing. Performance specifications&#13;
have often to be downgraded, but this is not the whole story. The need to&#13;
preserve performance norms in the face of materials inadequacy has induced&#13;
some of the most valuable innovative work in LDCs; machine designs have been&#13;
more closely adapted to the requirements of the job at hand, and the inttinsic&#13;
properties of the materials available have been better mastered. The operation&#13;
of these externalities, however, does not suffice to take away from the&#13;
magnitude of the supply deficiencies.&#13;
In part, these supply problems can be traced back in specific&#13;
instances to LDC attempts to set up steel production facilities in tandem&#13;
with the development of their machine industries, and also to their associated&#13;
attempts to encourage import substitution in the steel industry with the help&#13;
of a regime of quantitative restrictions and tariffs. The IBRD study of the&#13;
Indian forging industry, for example, documents that at the start of the 1970s&#13;
Indian steel prices, set at about 50-60% above world prices, were responsible&#13;
for a 20-30% increase in the costs of Indian forgings. The problems of&#13;
phasing construction and production plans in indigenous iron and steel mills&#13;
with the needs of machine production is compounded by long gestation lags&#13;
dictated by the very lumpy investments which are needed to ensure economies&#13;
of scale, or the adoption of the more modern production techniques in the&#13;
/1 The evidence on the "failure" of continuous flow production is indirect:&#13;
Soviet management appears to have retreated from full-blown continuous&#13;
flow operations to series production (and a wider product mix) in the&#13;
mid-1930s.&#13;
/2 This runs counter to the Gerschenkronian hypothesis that the "latest"&#13;
production and organization techniques can be adopted efficiently by&#13;
"backward" LDCs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15 &#13;
steel sector itself./1   The history of the Soviet steel industry provides an&#13;
interesting case in pointo Thus, the deliberate Soviet decision to scrap&#13;
existing steel mill construction projects in favor of building up-to-date&#13;
capacity ensuring specialisation and economics of scale in the steel industry,&#13;
implied that the phasing of the Soviet eoi.t; :.c * b:ic_;-i!- sector fell&#13;
completely out of step with the time schedule o£ the Soviet steel industry0&#13;
The equipment industries were starved of their principal raw matezials0    This&#13;
was responsible not only for the Soviet declscion to monitor severely the&#13;
allocations of scarce steel supplies, but also fcr the decision to alter&#13;
radically the product mix in a series of equ    touilding plants which had&#13;
originally been established to produce nonprl ority itewso The recult was an&#13;
enormous waste of resources, as in the testile mEchinery sector0    The raw&#13;
material bottleneck also had other far-zeaching consequences: the inability&#13;
to ensure a consistent quality of materials fneant, for example, that the&#13;
highly mechanized nature of production. in the agricultural equipment industry&#13;
on the principle of drill-=based machinery operations was totally inappro-&#13;
priate; more traditional lathe-based production techniques, which do not&#13;
require materials supplies of such strIct specifications, might have proved&#13;
more suitable0   Here again the adoption of very specialized foms of produc-&#13;
tion was based on an inadequate appreclation of the complementarity of&#13;
material quality requirements and the organizational mode of production, and&#13;
this in turn reduced the possibilities of relatively facile reconversions of&#13;
plant to other types of product mix.&#13;
(ii)  Castings, Forgings and Moan, z-: i4anufacture&#13;
Uhile the quality of pig iron, steel, sand, etc., available to the&#13;
foundry and forging industries is an im o-:;:   determinant of the cost of&#13;
cactinge, forgings and couponents delivered to tZ.e fachine-building industries,&#13;
it is significant that the technical staclaeds achieved in foundries and&#13;
forges, even in LDCa with some history of founndy/forge operations, are&#13;
generally low./2   In India, the IBRD mission wJas of the opinion that 65% of&#13;
Indian foundries would require more thfi five yezrs to produce castings of&#13;
international quality at competitive priceso/3 'Te Norea machinery report&#13;
details the problems: inadequate treatwent, cleaning and processing of sand&#13;
for molds, poor composition of sand, poor pl2nt layout, wastage of materials&#13;
at the forging stage which imposes costs at a later stage of machine finishing0&#13;
Finally, the organizational aspects of foundries, forges and component&#13;
manufacture have exercised planners in several LDCs as well as in the Soviet&#13;
Union0  This concern has stemmed from the possibility of setting up specialized&#13;
/1  Rhee and Uestphal in their paper, "Planning F'uture Import Substitution&#13;
and Export Expansion in Korea's Mechanica2 Engineering Industries,"&#13;

machinery industry complexes and the planned metal industry complexes,"&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
foundries and forges, and specialized facilities for the machining of a&#13;
limited set of parts, to service a wide range of user plants/industries. This&#13;
involves the principle that specialization by process can ensure scales of&#13;
production which would lie "beyond the bounds of possibility for vertically&#13;
integrated factories producing a complete product." Thus the inefficiencies&#13;
involved in the production of limited volumes of disparate final machine&#13;
products (as is the case in LDCs) could be mitigated by the setting up of&#13;
common foundries to produce castings of roughly similar dimensions and degree&#13;
of design complexity.&#13;
The literature on machine-building industries in developing&#13;
countries does not, however, point to any successful experiments in special-&#13;
ized foundries and forges. The difficulties of coordinating schedules with&#13;
the principal customers, of organizing timely shipments and of ensuring&#13;
quality, appear to be too onerous for the successful functioning of separate&#13;
large-scale foundry and forge facilities. The Soviet 1930s experiment with&#13;
the regional foundry set up in Moscow appears to have taken over 20 years to&#13;
yield the expected cost economies, and even then it was probably achieved&#13;
after a narrowing of its role to a supplier of castings for machine tools&#13;
alone./l Suggestions for setting up centralized foundry facilities at&#13;
Changwon, the new machinery industry complex in Korea, appear to have been&#13;
rejected in favor of vertical integration in individual large plants. In&#13;
India, some amount of castings are produced for outside customers in foundry&#13;
facilities owned by large machine building plants, e.g. HMT, The Mining and&#13;
Allied Machinery Corporation, etc., but these are necessarily ad hoc arrange-&#13;
ments in the nature of jobbing./2&#13;
Capital and Overheads:/3 The efficiency of capital use in the&#13;
equipment industries appears to hinge on three related factors: (a) the need&#13;
to spread the high overhead costs associated with indivisible investments&#13;
(and individual machine capacities) over large volumes of output; (b) the&#13;
need to evolve efficient forms of organization for planning the operations&#13;
and use of all three factors of production: labor, materials and capital; and&#13;
(c) the need to undertake the upgrading of current capabilities in existing&#13;
firms and to check the uninhibited tendency (characteristic of certain LDCs)&#13;
towards new investments in large-sized firms.&#13;
(i) Scale Economies&#13;
As we have discussed before, one of the distinguishing features of&#13;
equipment production is that it is subject to significant economies of scale.&#13;
To elaborate a little, scale economies are a function, not so much of the&#13;
total volume of investment concentrated in a single plant, but of the capacity&#13;
installed per plant for the production of an individual product. Taking the&#13;
/1 Granick, David: op. cit., p. 154.&#13;
/2 Argentina appears to be a striking exception. Component manufacture&#13;
appears to be well-established and to have attained a high degree of&#13;
technical development. See Cortes, op. cit., p. 30.&#13;
/3 This section draws heavily on Granick, David: op. cit. Chapter 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
argument a step further, a major determinant of the magnitude of scale&#13;
economies is the length of run per individual machine. This is why "lot" or&#13;
"batch" size is so important for equipment production, which is organized on&#13;
concepts of "series productiono" Production according to series refers to&#13;
the organization of simultaneous operations on a number /1 or "batch" of&#13;
product units (or parts) of more or less identical designo The `bctch`&#13;
refers to the number of units worked on in immediate succession by both labor&#13;
and the given item of equipment. Normally each machine or worker w2oks on&#13;
each unit per batcho   Obviously then, the larger the lot size1, the -oze&#13;
intensive the utilization of a given piece of equipment or specialized&#13;
worker /2 (eog. highly skilled fitters, set-up men, etco)    In more complex&#13;
situations, the products/parts to be machined or assembled may not be of&#13;
identical designo However, processing in batch is possible because either&#13;
disparate parts require identical machining or common parts or subansemblies&#13;
can be identified0 In the limit when the number of parts is very large,D&#13;
gseries production" might shade into "mass production" where both wnchineo&#13;
and workers work permanently on identical products (and identical pazts of&#13;
products)./3&#13;
Thus both series and mass production require production 'li large&#13;
volume, and since scale economies are limited to the capacity devoted to an&#13;
individual product, efficiency may be furthered by limiting each plcnt to a&#13;
single product, or at the very least to a small range of products0    lowever,&#13;
since the optimum utilization rate of individual machine capacitien is rarely&#13;
identical, it follows that bottlenecks or excess capacities might be avoided&#13;
through the expedient of subcontracting a part or machining activity (which&#13;
is intensive in the use of the critical equipment) to a separate production&#13;
entity which can itself achieve economies of scale by pooling orders from&#13;
diverse plants for the same component or machining activity0 Pushed to a&#13;
logical extreme, specialization then involves specialization by proceess&#13;
Thus, as in the case of foundry/forge operations (see the section on Material&#13;
Inputs), individual plants concentrating component production through the&#13;
pooling of technically similar orders achieve ranges of scale econoamie&#13;
per process which a vertically integrated plant cannot0&#13;
/1  Any number greater than two0&#13;
/2  Lamyai Rhee and Westphal suggest in their paper: "Factor Substitution,&#13;
Returns to Scale and the Organization of Production in the Mechanical&#13;
Engineering Industry," IBRD Draft, July 7, 1973, that indivisibility of&#13;
labor skills is of at least as much importance as capital indivisibility0&#13;
/3  It is interesting to note, in a more historical context, that the superiority&#13;
of American factory organization relative to the British, noted by British&#13;
Government Commissions during the years following the Great Exhibition&#13;
of 1851, was attributed primarily to the "adoption in most branchez of&#13;
industry of the 'manufacturing principle,' the production in large numbers&#13;
of standardized articles on a basis of repetition O       the principle&#13;
lending itself "to the use of mechanical methods1, particularly to the&#13;
development of automatic 'special purpose' machines designed foz a single&#13;
operation0"  See Burn, Duncan L. "The Genesis of American Engineering&#13;
Competition, 185070,," in Hughes, Thomas Parke, ed01, The Development of&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
(ii) Organizational Requirements&#13;
The organizational implications of production which seeks to ensure&#13;
scale economies are not trivial. Decisions have to be taken simultaneously&#13;
on several fronts: the decision to specialize by product/process, the&#13;
correct choice of equipment (given the scale of the market, the type of&#13;
raw materials and labor used, and therefore the sequence of production&#13;
adopted), the identification of common parts or subassemblies per machine&#13;
operation, the decision to "share" capacity between disparate parts which&#13;
require similar processing, the choice of a particular mode of organization&#13;
(whether "one-off"/l "series" or "mass" or a mix of both) etc. All these&#13;
decisions'&gt;tturn, have rather important implications for the requirements of&#13;
labor skills, materials handling capacity, inventory scheduling, quality&#13;
control, etc. Series production with general purpose machines, for example,&#13;
may require significantly higher complements of highly skilled workers;&#13;
however, continuous flow operations carried out with a newly industrialized&#13;
work force require a higher proportion of supervisors, technicians and&#13;
engineers. Again, while mass production requires fairly close scheduling of&#13;
work both within and between shops, once the schedule has been satisfactorily&#13;
worked out and enforced, production planning under continuous flow is far&#13;
less complicated than under series production; however, since both workers&#13;
and shops must produce on time under continuous flow operations, the schedule&#13;
has to be paced to the efficiency of the least efficient worker; a slowing&#13;
dowr. throws the whole operation out of gear. Again, since efficiency dictates&#13;
minimisation of machine down-times, both series and continous flow require&#13;
careful planning of inventories, materials flow and- maintenance; however, not&#13;
only are the requirements more onerous under continuous flow, the obligatory&#13;
"freezing" of norms may even be inappropriate in the fluid conditions of an&#13;
LDC where levels of efficiency, low to start with, are being upgraded with&#13;
the accretion of experience. Finally, the greater the need for accuracy in&#13;
tolerance limits, the greater the cost escalations resulting from the need to&#13;
remachine parts in the event of shortfalls in quality.&#13;
While LDCs are on the whole less likely to opt for full-scale mass&#13;
production (except perhaps in the auto industry), the problems outlined above&#13;
are not totally irrelevant. The distinction between series production and&#13;
mass production is at best hazy: production in LDCs often adopts a series&#13;
approach to mass production: different parts from diverse end-products will&#13;
be run as a continuous flow operation or part of a plant's equipment may be&#13;
arranged in continuous flow lines. A proper amalgam of the two, which involves&#13;
a shift away from the continuous mass output of a single part on a single&#13;
machine, requires, if anything, a significant effort at redesign of parts and&#13;
analysis of the alternative operational possibilities of given machine&#13;
capacities in order to achieve a commonality of parts between machine&#13;
products of different designs and to concentrate "machining operations into&#13;
the least possible number of working places".&#13;
/1 "One-off" refers to a production operation which turns out only one unit&#13;
of a final product, e.g., one unit of steel plant equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(iii) Firm Size&#13;
For an LDC setting up equiphisnt pro&amp;uctioon, the complexity of the&#13;
decisions involved, the cost minimizing effects 0f scelae and the seductive-&#13;
ness of the "latestt" technology, usually tilt the investment decision&#13;
against the upgrading of established plants, and i' favor of newi investments&#13;
in large-sized plantso   Apart from the scale TaetoT (uhich is sought to be&#13;
ensured from the start by the emphasis on lezeoo), D the decision to under-&#13;
take new investment is based on the following rctioaslo. Thrzec i    no need to&#13;

Further, tax and interest rate subsidies designed to 1nduce investment into&#13;
new areas of production usually encourage large o,e0/2 Again the very&#13;
inexperience of new units, and the consequent high initial costs of Identi-&#13;
fying and developing supplier networks, reinforces the tendency of new firms&#13;
to reotrict the range of buy-out decislons in order to reduce downtimes on&#13;
more regular capacity: critical capacities aze th    efcore ? natalled in-house.&#13;
But this in turn enlarges the problem of meshing i-3chinz csapacittecS and the&#13;

below half that figure. It was no wonder then that the enterprise sought to&#13;
diversify its product range. The Korean machinery report documents a similar&#13;
failure to "concentrate on a fairly small number of products," and the inability&#13;
to achieve large cumulative output, as well as the inability to realize&#13;
sufficient specialization through a complex subcontracting system. The IBRD&#13;
study on the textile machinery industry in India noted that of the 250-280&#13;
(textile machinery) component suppliers in India in 1975, only about 10 could&#13;
have been said to have produced components of acceptable quality. Of 20&#13;
plants visited by the mission, 10 had their own foundries.&#13;
While the available literature (e.g. the IBRD studies on the Indian&#13;
Foundry, Forge, Textile Machinery, and Commercial Vehicle industries, and of&#13;
the Korean Machinery Sector), identifies problems of inadequate plant layout&#13;
and operations, the weak management of materials, work-in-process and finished&#13;
product inventories, and the somewhat cavalier attitude towards machine&#13;
maintenance and quality control, there is little discussion, however, in the&#13;
empirical literature of the complex interrelationships between modes of&#13;
production organization, types of labor demand, maintenance requirements,&#13;
quality norms, inspection methods, planning and scheduling. Granick's&#13;
account and evaluation of alternative modes of organization in the Soviet&#13;
metal-forming industry during the period 1928-37 constitutes an obvious&#13;
exception. Moreover, recent experimental work by Rhee and Westphal on&#13;
questions of scale and interdependence in Korean mechanical engineering&#13;
industries may also be seen as an attempt to bridge this gap./1 This is not&#13;
to say that managers in LDCs /2 are totally unaware of the interdependence of&#13;
decisions in these seemingly diverse areas. The setting up of separate&#13;
branches of Hindusthan Machine Tools in Hyderabad and Pinjore, and the&#13;
shipping out of excess capacities from the main works in Bangalore, were&#13;
obviously designed both to achieve a greater balance of machine capacities by&#13;
appropriate groupings of machine tools as well as to reduce production&#13;
scheduling problems at the Bangalore plant.&#13;
To sum up, even a brief tour d'horizon of the factors affecting&#13;
static efficiency in the capital goods sector suggests that a number of&#13;
simple but carefully directed measures taken at the level of the shop floor&#13;
might serve to raise performance levels and current capabilities in LDC&#13;
machinery manufacture: measures designed to improve labor skills, plant&#13;
layout and flow of work, the quality of castings and components, operating&#13;
practices, the maintenance of machines, tooling usage and auxiliary systems,&#13;
product and materials testing, etc. These measures could serve to effect&#13;
cost reductions of a once-and-for-all nature. For an LDC firm to effect a&#13;

/2 At the time of the author's visit to Praga Machine Tools, the management was&#13;
debating the relative merits of organizing production by product line as&#13;
opposed to organization according to process, for a group of its older,&#13;

Cooper Engineering.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

continuous lowering of its cost curve requires the repeated adoption of&#13;
improvements by the management in the organization of the firm. NoweverT&#13;
this introduces issues which belong properly in the realm of dynamic effi-&#13;
ciency.&#13;
Considerations of Dynamic Efficiency&#13;
Two routes are open to firms attempting to maintain competitiveness&#13;
in the long run0 The first consists of continuous attempts at cost reduction;&#13;
either through improvements in the utilization of input factors and changes&#13;
in the manufacturing process, or through incremental product quality changes.&#13;
The second route consists of major design innovations. Both require R and Do&#13;
The empirical literature suggests that little R&amp;D is currently undertaken&#13;
by LDC firms. Pack /1 surveying the available evidence concludes that the&#13;
little R&amp;D which is in fact undertaken is designed to effect cost reductions&#13;
rather than design innovations0&#13;
Cost Reduction and Incremental Innovation. The first route, that&#13;
of incremental innovation in product design and processes of manufacture,&#13;
when pursued over the long term0 generally requires increasing specialization&#13;
and economies of scale0/2 This is because, as the firm progresses doEn its&#13;
learning curve, the incremental benefits from cost reductions generally tend&#13;
to become smaller,/3 and hence to be worthwhile must be reaped over larger&#13;
volumes of oututo    The successful adoption of such cost reductions then&#13;
depends on the efficiency with which such incremental innovations are inter-&#13;
nalized; in other words0 successful cost reduction depends on the efficiency&#13;
of organization and managemento The literature on capital goods production&#13;
suggests, however, that the achievement of optimal forms of technological and&#13;
managerial organization poses problems of a different order from those&#13;
involved in the once-and-for=all improvementS referred to above. While&#13;
certain solutions for relatively simple scheduling or for plant operation&#13;
problems can indeed be absorbed through interplant contacts and the employment&#13;
of consultants, domestic and foreign, the know-how required for the continued&#13;
adoption of optimum organizational arrangements of factors of production for&#13;
purposes of cost reduction appears to be more difficult to come by without&#13;
in-plant RD&amp;E. The literature seems to suggest that the adoption of these&#13;

more innovative solutions is not necessarily ensured by the pressures of&#13;
competition or by more thorough arrangements for foreign technology transfer.&#13;
The work of Rhee and Westphal, which utilizes rather complex programming&#13;
algorithms to arrive at utilization levels for indivisible labor and capital&#13;
and to study the implications of scale and interdependence for certain levels&#13;
of material costs, underlines the complexity of the decision-m-king processes&#13;
involved./1 DC firms have an edge in the identification and development of&#13;
efficient forms of technical organization because of their access to managers&#13;
with long experience. In LDCs, because of the novelty of the sector and the&#13;
occurrence of different operating conditions, this experience has to be&#13;
acquired deliberately through the working out of problems on home ground.&#13;
Managers in machine tool firms in India returned again and again to the&#13;
importance of accumulating indigenous experience and of committing enough&#13;
"mistakes" if a certain "know-how" is to be internalized, even after a&#13;
"successful transfer of foreign technology" has occurred.&#13;
Granick cites the case of the two Soviet tractor plants at Stalin-&#13;
grad and Kharkov which provides a neat illustration of the "need for working&#13;
out technological processes on home ground." The Stalingrad plant, opened in&#13;
1930, was built with extensive help from American companies responsible for&#13;
the detailed engineering and design of individual shops and with thorough&#13;
arrangements for the large-scale training of Soviet engineers, foremen and&#13;
skilled workers in American factories as well as in the Soviet plant. The&#13;
Kharkov plant opened at the end of 1931, built on the Stalingrad model and for&#13;
the same output volume, but with fewer foreign technicians and workers and&#13;
with Russian-built equipment functioning according to the newly developed&#13;
norms of planning and scheduling worked out at the Stalingrad plant, was able&#13;
to exhibit superior performance. Apparently a great deal of information on&#13;
production design, the location of ancillary facilities, the requirements of&#13;
maintenance, etc., which "was not gleaned from observation abroad or from&#13;
foreign consultants could be learned from even a very brief period of opera-&#13;
tion of the first Russian tractor plant."&#13;
The importance of such learning, the necessity of working out solu-&#13;
tions to "mistakes," leads one back to the need to "experience" large volumes&#13;
of cumulative output,/2 and to spread cost reductions over larger scales of output.&#13;
Moreover, if Alchian's insights into the behaviour of learning curves in airframe&#13;
production can be generalized, the stability of progress functions appears to&#13;
depend on the continuity of production./3&#13;

against DC competitors in export markets, and against iaported foreign&#13;
equipment in the domestic market, and in order to ensure the competitiveness&#13;
of the capital goods industry's client sectors (if an import-substituting&#13;
regime prevails), it is important that LDC machine vaanufacture be able to&#13;
offset the cost reductions which DC competitors are able to effect through&#13;
continuous d'-ign improvements./1 The question, of couiTse, arises as to&#13;
whether it is necessary for an LDC to undertake expensive R!D eupenditures&#13;
when it is possible to buy out new innovations in design as and when they are&#13;
evolved in the DCso&#13;
(i)  The Case Against Foreign Technoloy Purchase&#13;
First, design changes evc,ved in DCs are usually undertaaken&#13;
as a response to a different set of preveailing factor&#13;
priceso They tend generally to be capital saving or to be&#13;
built on material specikications and standards hAich differ&#13;
considerably from those relevant to LDCs.&#13;
iu* Moreover, they are built for optimum utilization at scales&#13;
which may not be immediately within the --.% of LDC producers0&#13;
Adoption of DC designs is therefore often based on an&#13;
inadequate appreciation of the extent of the market open to&#13;
LDCs (sales depend both on r,:;.E.1on and m ,         efforts)&#13;
and of the costs of production incTrred for the adaptation&#13;
of material specifications to local LDC evailabilities0&#13;
This explains the concentration of LDC innovative ef0orts on&#13;
material input substitutionslo/2&#13;
It is arguable, therefore, that R&amp;D opzrations undertatten in&#13;
LDCs may tend in the directioa of design innovations which&#13;
best exploit LDC factor availabilties0 indeed, if undertaken&#13;
early enough, it may be possible to u?grade LDC equiygent&#13;
sufficiently to avoid a soltuation of technical dominance&#13;
which an improved DC machine design is able to achieve,&#13;
despite,the embodied labor"saving iwprovements, primarily&#13;
due to the extent of the reduction of equipment cost which&#13;
the innovation is able to effect.0/3&#13;
the argument for foreign technology purchase also assumes&#13;
that licensors are continuzlly willing and able to transmit&#13;
the latest designs0 Obvicasly the willingness of DC firms&#13;
to license technology will depend on the expected payoff&#13;
/1  The accumulation of small process improve,dents for a given design may, of&#13;
course, add up to significant product development0&#13;
/2  See Pack, opo cit., for evidenceO&#13;
/3  Pack analyzes the conditions:   (a) lnitial capital-labor ratios of DC and&#13;
LDC equipment; (b) the relative factor prices; and (c) the relative rates&#13;
of reduction in all input prices    equipment, labor and material - which&#13;
determine the point at which DC equipment e ill technically "dominate" LDC&#13;
equipment, despite the labor-saving bias of innovation0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

from technology transfer or license sales compared to the&#13;
earnings from potential exports directed at the LDC seeking&#13;
the license, as well as at the LDC's own export markets.&#13;
The DC producer's willingness is also conditioned by the&#13;
degree of competitiveness characterizing the international&#13;
market for the particular equipment design and the innovative&#13;
stage reached by its own competitors /1.&#13;
iv.  Again if the technology transfer route is taken by the DC&#13;
innovator in the case of a new innovation (as could happen&#13;
if the LDC market was subject to quotas), the transfer is&#13;
usually accompanied by agreements restricting export./2&#13;
v, Even if DC licensors were willing to transmit the newest&#13;
technology, the empirical evidence suggests that the resource&#13;
costs of technology transfer can be fairly high, so that the&#13;
ability of DC licensors to transfer the technology and the&#13;
ability of LDC purchasers to absorb the technology may be&#13;
limited. Teece, studying the resource costs of 26 technology&#13;
transfer arrangements carried out by multinational firms,&#13;
concludes that the common view that "technology is nothing&#13;
but a set of blueprints that is usable at nominal cost to&#13;
all," and that "the marginal cost of successive application&#13;
is trivial compared to the average cost of research, develop-&#13;
ment and application", is erroneous./3 Technology transfer&#13;
costs include, apart from the cost of physical items such as&#13;
tooling, equipment and blueprints which embody the new&#13;
technology, the costs of transferring the information&#13;
without which the hardware cannot be effectively utilized.&#13;
They include the costs of pre-engineering technology&#13;
exchanges, engineering costs, R&amp;D costs associated with the&#13;
solution of unexpected problems and the adaptation and&#13;
modification of technology during the transfer, the pre-start-&#13;
up training costs, and the "excess manufacturing costs&#13;
representing the learning and debugging costs incurred&#13;
during the start-up phase" before the plant achieves per-&#13;
formance specifications. It is these support activities&#13;
which constitute "the crux of the process of technology&#13;
transfer."&#13;

to manufacture cement plants with any existing internationally reputed&#13;
producer.&#13;

Typically the costs of technology tT&amp;nsfer cGooca4ted with&#13;
machinery projects appear to be higher than tha costo ascociated&#13;
with process industries (chemicals and p     cs-.m refining)0&#13;
Whereas transfer costs averaged only 192 of total project costs for&#13;
all 26 projects in the Teece sampleG theo uachinory project transfer&#13;
costs ranged from 24% to 59% (the one aveeptina involved a 10%&#13;
transfer cost share). The Teece study aloo uac@rlinad the critical&#13;
importance of the transferor's own aaroEiAeTy with t'ne new tech-&#13;
nology, the age of the technology , and thu mkbe of firms using&#13;
similar or competitive technology. The soot dfficult gnd hence&#13;
costly technology transfers are characteriaed "by few applications,&#13;

Thus °°leading edge"° technology is aPt tO a  ino  a snate eo  flux;&#13;

transfers difficult0 Further, the Teece study oeezerved that the&#13;

were also important determinants of the cooto of trankser0 Inter-&#13;
estingly enough , the effects of the age of the teehnology9 the&#13;
number of firms with identical technology and transferee size&#13;

The magnitude of the transfer costs and the importance of the diffusion&#13;
procCso (as well as the critical importance of e   a   -hsc      n and size of the&#13;
transferee) suggest that at least for the l'L-'9 tora esnpSrienced LDC firms&#13;
it oight be in the firm's interest to undertalte Ladigenuou R&amp;D to maintain&#13;
dynamic competitiveness0 The author's interviteo with Indian machine tool&#13;
firms suggest that at least one explanation for the poucity of intrv=plant&#13;
design innovations stems from the inaccurate forecaoting of the magnitude of&#13;
theDe trenefer costs./3 But obviously this is not tho whole explanation for&#13;

(ii)  The Prevalence of Foreign Technolo     Purchaaa.     lT.Z Explanations&#13;
A large part of the explanation piobebly lies in the joint operation&#13;
of an array of factors which induce LDC fims to opt for stability of market&#13;
/R  Each additional application enables the   _:o ''0o to acquire additional&#13;
knouledge about the technology by obeerving the effects of different&#13;
operating parameters on production, and also to transfer experienced&#13;
operstors and engineers from older plants to the new plant to assist&#13;
starztup and training0 The age of the innovation determines the stabil-&#13;
ity of engineering designs and the transferor0s hnowledge of manufactur-&#13;
ing procezseso&#13;
/2  It is important to note, however, that the number of machinery-technology&#13;
transfer cases included in the total Teece sample of 26 was only 9. Con-&#13;
sequGntly, the effects of sampling variability on his results may be&#13;

shares, rather than for profit maximization. The rather general application&#13;
of import substitution regimes in LDCs (Brazil, India, Korea) reduces the&#13;
threat of foreign competition, and the oligopolisitic /1 market structure&#13;
usually characteristic of LDC equipment industries introduces an element of&#13;
stability which reduces the need for R&amp;D. It is only when a competing&#13;
domestic producer attempts to increase its market share by undertaking&#13;
research or the purchase of a foreign design license that domestic producers&#13;
are induced to retaliate. The usual option chosen to counteract the domestic&#13;
competitor's headstart is to buy out a different foreign license./2 An even&#13;
more important factor is perhaps the limited size of the current domestic&#13;
market for particular items of machinery,/3 which implies that the market for&#13;
the improved product, which is apt to cut into the market for the existing&#13;
design, is likely to be even smaller. The limited size of the market has&#13;
other pernicious effects: it limits the extent of learning, militates against&#13;
the achievement of scale economies in research, and accentuates the force of&#13;
all those factors in the production environment of LDC firms which tend to&#13;
cause a divergence between private and social benefits and costs.&#13;
III. The Case for State Intervention&#13;
The case for state intervention rests on three factors: (a) the&#13;
existence of external economies in the mechanical engineering sectors; (b)&#13;
the relevance of the infant industry (or increasing returns to scale) argument&#13;
for intervention; and (c) the efficacy of planning exercises in reducing&#13;
uncertainty./4&#13;
(i) External economies which cause a divergence between private and&#13;
social benefits and costs, appear to characterize mechanical engineering&#13;
industry operations in a number of areas. We saw in Part II that, while LDC&#13;
comparative advantage in machinery production generally stems from the&#13;
relatively low wages paid to labor (and the relative labor intensity of&#13;
production operations), the advantages of a low wage are sometimes nullified&#13;
/1 Though about 128 registered firms operated in the Indian machine tool&#13;
sector in 1972, the market was clearly dominated by three large firms.&#13;
/2 Pack has a comprehensive discussion of LDC satisficing behavior in the&#13;
unpublished piece referred to on p. 1.&#13;
/3 The low growth of the major user industries, e.g., general engineering,&#13;
automobiles, etc., is usually cited as an important explanation for&#13;
the paucity of innovational effort in the area of precision machine&#13;
tools in India. See Business India, "Machine Tools, Narrowing the&#13;
Technology Gap," No. 26, March 5-18, 1979, pp. 51-52.&#13;
/4 In some areas of state intervention, arguments (a), (b), (c) may&#13;
coexist. While the effects of external economies and learning in infant&#13;
industries may be similar, in that both may lead to increasing returns to&#13;
scale, the conceptual distinction is maintained here, because the second&#13;
phenomenon belongs properly in the dynamic context, while the first may&#13;
operate in a static framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
by poor labor productivity0 One evident cause of low labor productlv4ty&#13;
was found to be poor labor training0 It was pointed out also that individual&#13;
plants undertook inadequate or partial laoor training in ozder to minimize&#13;
losses caused by the bidding away of labor by competing fi.rTs, after the&#13;
labor traini-N had occurred. The indivi6ual firm, faced with the possibility&#13;
of a loss of such investment in intangible capita.l preferred to undertake&#13;
less than the socially optimum degree of investment0 There appears to be a&#13;
fairly strong case, therefore, for the establisiment of government programs for&#13;
direct vocational training,L but more importantly, for the initiation and&#13;
subsidization of a scheme for in-plant training of labor, preferably on-the-&#13;
job./2  Such a program of in-plant training might be self-financing, as in&#13;
Britain, where a tax levied on firms in the mechanical engineering industries&#13;
is used to subsidise on-the-job training in those firms which have set up&#13;
approved programs.&#13;
A variant of on-the-job training which does not require subsidiza-&#13;
tion, but is predicated on the existencz of' a substantial market for the&#13;
output of the engineering sector1, is a deliberate policy of increasing the&#13;
number of work shifts0   This route was pushed to some extent in the Soviet&#13;
metal-fabricating industry of the 1930so .Tts scope may, however, be limited:&#13;
increased shift work generally gives rise to an increased demand for tech-&#13;
nicians and supervisory personnel1, a deuand which the Soviets, for example1,&#13;
were unable to meet adequately in the 1930s./3 Shift wozk also results in&#13;
some loss of individual responsibility for worrk and for maintenance of&#13;
equipmento These losses might become untenable for an LDC intent on the&#13;
simultaneous development of factory discipline0&#13;
Part II also outlined the significant itprovements which could be&#13;
achieved in plant layout, flow of work and operating practices generally,&#13;
"if technical expertise on production were available to management01     Large&#13;
firms might possess the resources for the hiring of domestic and foreign&#13;
know-how, but small firms usually do not:0  2owever, efficiency in the small&#13;
firm may confer an externality on the rest of the sector via the increased&#13;
possibilities of subcontracting0   Thus, a govern eat p2roagm for lechnical&#13;
assistance through "engineers and production people experienced in the 'best&#13;
practices' in operations, use of machineoc flaoz of uork, could have an almost&#13;
immediate payoff in improved operationoi." The o-ganiEsation of technical&#13;
assistance arrangements has an additiongl rationale0   1.We found in 2?arts I and&#13;

management which are in keeping with factor endowments in LDCs. However, the&#13;
need to adhere to the logic of "intermediate" (as opposed to the "latest")&#13;
production and organization stages may not be immediately obvious, and the&#13;
range of possible technical and organizational options may be unknown,&#13;
particularly to small firms. It is here that a pool of engineering skills&#13;
organized for the dissemination of pre-investment assistance would confer a&#13;
range of social benefits which individual plants acting atomistically would&#13;
be unable to attain. Engineers conversant with "best practices" operating in&#13;
the West in the 1950s and 1960s, for example, might provide a useful starting&#13;
point for particular LDCs. The idea of organizing technical data banks (an&#13;
idea popular in certain "technology" circles) seems much less appealing, if&#13;
only because, for successful application, the choice of technology has still&#13;
to be worked out by engineers with know-how capable of matching available&#13;
techniques to specific LDC capabilities.&#13;
A similar gain is likely to result from the organization of central-&#13;
ized engineering consultancy services, particularly for the conception,&#13;
setting up, and operation of turn-key plants. In LDCs facing rapid expansion&#13;
in sectors such as power generation, and petroleum refining capacity (i.e.,&#13;
sectors which demand large volumes of plant equipment), the availability of&#13;
engineering personnel may represent a crucial bottleneck within individual&#13;
plants. The demand for such engineering services, however, is apt to rise&#13;
rapidly at a time of significant increase in equipment demand, because of the&#13;
need to match the specifications stipulated in the technical designs being&#13;
adopted by the client sectors to the capabilities, both current and potential,&#13;
of existing producers in the LDC equipment-building sectors./l While it&#13;
might not be possible for individual machine-building plants to carry&#13;
engineers with the requisite skills on their permanent payrolls, it might be&#13;
possible for them to hire engineering services from a centralized pool as the&#13;
need arises.&#13;
Another lacuna, noted in Korea and India, in contrast to the best&#13;
run Western machinery and metal-working establishments, relates to the&#13;
nonavailability of "technical material available to the machine operator and&#13;
first line supervisors": that is standardized technical material which helps&#13;
improve the accuracy or quality of operator functions. The organization and&#13;
systematization of such information (in the form of condensed technical&#13;
handbooks, wall charts, tabular materials, etc.) is usually outside the&#13;
capabilities of small machine-building firms in LDCs. The-requirements and&#13;
usefulness of centralizing such information make it an appropriate function&#13;
for a government institute associated with the mechanical engineering sector.&#13;
An associated need, identified in several LDCs starting out on&#13;
capital goods production (Brazil, India, and the Soviet Union, for example),&#13;
relates to the standardization of materials and parts used by machinery&#13;
firms.&#13;
The opportunities for the purchase of foreign technology world-wide&#13;
means that there exist at any one time in the typical LDC mechanical engin-&#13;
eering industry machine designs and operations based on disparate standards,&#13;

the private costs of a disruption in production caused during the process of&#13;
adoptiou of national standards. In other wordo, nzt gains t-yill accrue from&#13;
nationmidde standardization due both to the narrowing of the range of product&#13;
types p@E achine in the equipment-producing firms and to the poosi,bilities&#13;
for undaertking the production of standardized fasteners and toolin3 in&#13;
opcialigad plants 02 The appropriate timing for the introduction of norms&#13;
for atandardied tooling, etc., is then a function of the volume of national&#13;

opposed to basic and applied research)./L /2&#13;
Finally, the external economy argument supports the case for&#13;
state aid in the organization of marketing facilities for the export of LDC&#13;
mechanical engineering equipment. The requirements for machinery exports&#13;
differ considerably from those for the export of traditional consumer goods./3&#13;
Machinery is bought on specifications, quality, performance and reputation.&#13;
Buyers often place orders incorporating special custom features: this&#13;
requires a sales engineering capacity, incorporating design and technical&#13;
capability. Buyers also require the assurance of a reliable service engineer-&#13;
ing network. LDC governments might help ensure product quality by setting up&#13;
(and possibly leasing the services of) centralized facilities for both mate-&#13;
rials and final product testing. These services may otherwise be beyond the&#13;
reach of individual machinery producers./4 Sales and service engineering&#13;
might be taken care of by large-scale trading companies either set up or&#13;
subsidized by the state for the purpose of enlarging the ambit of export&#13;
activity to cover smail and medium firms which would otherwise be deterred&#13;
from export activity by the prospect of initially large overheads.&#13;
(ii) Infant Industry Support&#13;
The second set of arguments for state intervention derives from the&#13;
relevance of the infant industry argument to the case of mechanical engineering&#13;
goods production. We noted in Part II the importance of economies of scale&#13;
for machine-building activities. Large volumes of output were necessary for&#13;
the spreading of overhead costs (both capital, highly skilled labor and R&amp;D),&#13;
as well as for the accretion of learning (though in the case of learning large&#13;

stitutes a "leading sector" in terms of the pace of technology change&#13;
worldwide, the major advanced semiconductor technology firms in the US,&#13;
Japan and Europe are receiving a varied range of explicit and implicit&#13;
support from their governments (R&amp;D and production subsidies, the&#13;
establishment of R&amp;D laboratories, availability of venture capital,&#13;
conditions facilitating merger, etc.). I am indebted to Magdi Iskander&#13;

domestic market against foreign competitors, is usually z-1-.-;l     through&#13;
outright prohibitions on the import of `similars" or through oc.;:0c./2&#13;
However, since quantitative restriction measures reduce the choice set of&#13;
equipment designs available to machinery users by drastically llmlt;'.g&#13;
foreign competition, they tend to encourage inef'Liciencies in the domestic&#13;
machine-building industries0 A more preferable pol:icy tco7. would be the&#13;
imposition of tariffs /3 for a limited period of time (the o-).:.ocl b1ing&#13;
announced in advance) during which domestic producers cou:.d hope to takse&#13;
advantage of the domestic market to progress downm zhelz learning cu.rOveso  The&#13;
possibility of foreign import, though at a higher price, serves to retain a&#13;
salutary element of competition0   Foreign imports could alwanys be resorted to&#13;
if quality slipped badly in the domestic plant. Nowever, here too ths&#13;
judicious organization of centralized domestic enginering services (or of&#13;
foreign consultancy services) by the state, of the sozt recoueadee In&#13;
III(a), in tandem with the application of protection, wsu.ole go some way&#13;
toward ensuring quality0   An alternative measure ewould be the 6irect&#13;
subsidization of production for a limited period0 Korea, for exanple,&#13;
subsidizes the use of investment funds in the mechanical eLgineeszrn   Industries&#13;
(rates of return are hypothesized to be low in the wachInLsery industrzies,&#13;
particularly because of long gestation periods; mozeover    r capl.tal market&#13;
is insufficiently developed)0   This, however, has the demerit that cm interest&#13;
rate subsidy tends to encourage the use of capital reelative to labor0.  A&#13;
variant of the interest rate subsidy would be the provislon of ovs2ehead&#13;
services (industrial site and service facilities) at subsldized ra 2eSo/4&#13;
/1  However, if the stability of the learning curve iu sought, to be ensured,&#13;
stable output volumes are required, and thio Iln tur pcjintS to 'ahs need&#13;
for large scales of production, if a short leazrins period Is a L30&#13;
simultaneously desired0&#13;
/2  This also has the merit of not involving any budgetary operations0&#13;
/3  The height of the tariff should take adequate account of the inefficiencies&#13;
of domestic subcontractors (if the government~ is also seeking t.o develop&#13;
the supplier industries)O   This was pointed oLt to me by ;i-2C*. :sLtander.&#13;
/4  Subsidies appear to have played an important part 1n stare pol:'cies for&#13;
the promotion of the engineering industries in Prus31a anc, Japn.0   The&#13;
first hydraulic press and steam engines in Germany were produced in state&#13;
subsidized factories, while in Meij1i Japan, government subsidles were&#13;
used to foster shipbuilding and marine engineering products. Sze U000&#13;

Machine-building firms enjoying tariff protection might be more&#13;
easily induced to strive for quality if the state were to use suasion as well&#13;
as incentives (subsidies and arrangements for centralized marketing) to&#13;
encourage early export. Moreover, exports of domestic machines would also&#13;
help enlarge the size of the market facing the domestic producer./1 The&#13;
market might be further enlarged if LDC governments were to conclude agree-&#13;
ments for the setting up of free trade areas and planned production facilities&#13;
for LDC mechanical engineering products.&#13;
Before we move on to the third major rationale for state intervention&#13;
in the capital goods sector, however, it might be well to explore a little&#13;
further the relevance of the argument for scale economies in two important&#13;
areas of policy and to tie in the concerns, voiced in Part II, about the size&#13;
structure of LDC firms and the nature of the technology absorption and learning&#13;
process.&#13;
As we saw in Part II, attempts to follow the Gerschenkronian route&#13;
of adopting the "latest" technology are sometimes self-defeating: in these&#13;
cases intermediate production technologies were judged to be more attuned to&#13;
LDC capabilities. An additional argument for going the intermediate stages&#13;
/2 route is the fact that the "latest" technology often delivers a sophis-&#13;
ticated machine with a restricted LDC market. Moreover, a sophisticated&#13;
machine with a wealth of features is not always the most appropriate design&#13;
for facilitating learning. Indeed, experienced machine toolmakers in India&#13;
suggested that a sturdy design with an assured high volume market was a more&#13;
appropriate vehicle for learning in LDCs. These learning effects may be&#13;
important to bear in mind for LDCs where foreign technology licenses are&#13;
monitored,/3 or where engineering expertise is being set up to assist small&#13;
firms in the choice of techniques [see Part III(a)].&#13;
A second area where policy needs to be appropriately designed to&#13;
take account of scale economies is that of investment allocation in the&#13;
mechanical engineering industries. As we saw in Part II, the size of the&#13;
/1 Subsidies have additional merit. Since they are a strain on the budget,&#13;
there is ultimately some pressure to get rid of them. Moreover, entry&#13;
into export markets may induce firms to maximize profits rather than&#13;
to satisfice (see Parts II and III(a)].&#13;
/2 Nota bene: this is not, however, synonymous with arguments for "reinvented&#13;
intermediate technology." The "latest" technology might be relatively&#13;
easy to assimilate if other complementary factors were available and&#13;
industry know-how internalized." The American foundry industry was able&#13;
to adopt the most modern German casting techniques in the latter half of&#13;
the nineteenth century because immigrant German skilled labor and engin-&#13;
eers were available to man the foundry shops. See D.L. Burn, in Hughes,&#13;
T.P., op. cit. pp. 101-112.&#13;
/3   One school of thought contends that LDC royalty rates for foreign&#13;
technology licenses are set too low to accommodate adequate technology&#13;
transfer.&#13;

The first iosue, reacting to the need f$r      hljeTa ieaind paitterns,&#13;
translates itself into an argument for a stabLe rate - ' .-c    Y   Th.L;e mechanical&#13;
engineering sectors are distinguiohable from the -onasux er -.cc6z, industries in&#13;
that the growth of the sector is a function, not co much of the level of&#13;
nationiaml inoeD, but of the growth rate of the econouy. Uence it in important&#13;
foe governments contempleting economywide yt-wll:. .on policos (rarticularly&#13;

promotion of enports of engineering goods following the onuet of recession in&#13;
So far we have referred to the need for EcrcTc planning0   The discus-&#13;

management in LDC equipment firms. Recent work by Rhee and Westphal has&#13;
pointed to the payoffs involved in ensuring economies of scale (and to a&#13;
lesser degree from taking account of interdependencies)./I While the models&#13;
utilized have not yet been tested operationally in LDCs, the complexity of&#13;
the issues dealt with suggests /2 that "producers should have a better&#13;
framework for costing their products than the traditional bookkeeping framework&#13;
of aggregate financial transactions" and that the industry should have access&#13;
to arrangements for "man-model-computer iterations" of mechanical engineering&#13;
processes, manned by teams of economists and engineers. Such arrangements&#13;
need not necessarily be funded by government; they could equally well be set&#13;
up and funded by private industry, but with access to government technical&#13;
information systems. A related service, which could be performed either&#13;
singly or jointly by the private sector and government, concerns the acquisiton,&#13;
processing and dissemination of international marketing information which is&#13;
"critically important in determining the optimum product differentiation for&#13;
an export market."&#13;

            The capital goods sector in LDCs : a case
            for state intervention
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This study examines the case for the
            state promotion of machinery production in LDCs. It begins
            by setting out the rationale for capital goods manufacture
            in a range of semi-industrialized developing countries. The
            study then delineates the principal features of machinery
            production which distinguish it from the consumer goods or
            process industries, with a view to identifying the
            particular constraints to efficient operations in the
            capital goods sector. The threefold typology of constraints
            which emerges from this examination underlines the case for,
            and suggests the modalities of, state intervention in the sector.
