                         groundwork for improved power system planning and fuel supply by&#13;
                         providing the tools and other support necessary to enhance in-house&#13;
                         capability to prepare, implement and operate current and future&#13;
                         projects.&#13;
&#13;
Benefitsand Risks:       Benefits: The rehabilitation of the Hartha Power Station Units 2 and 3&#13;
                         will provide an additional 400MW to the national grid benefiting&#13;
                         electricity consumers all over Iraq. The project is expected to directly&#13;
                         impact approximately 1 million households for a period of 20 years&#13;
                         and supply power to grid-connected industrial consumers.&#13;
                         Risks: The main risks are the incidence of corruption due to a weak&#13;
                         control environment, slow progress due to unfamiliarity with the&#13;
                         Bank's guidelines and procedures, low level of competition and&#13;
                         therefore high prices due to perception of poor security and a structure&#13;
                         that i s not conducive to efficient operation of the sector.&#13;

                                   BACKGROUNDAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
Country Background&#13;
&#13;
1.      Large oil reserves and abundant natural and human resources enabled Iraq to attain the status&#13;
of a middle-income country inthe 1970s. Income per capita rose to over US$3,600 inthe early 1980s.&#13;
Today, Iraq's human development indicators are among the lowest in the region. Per capita income&#13;
dropped to about US$770-1,020 by 2001. The 2005 income per capita of US$1,200 i s about one-third&#13;
of what Iraqis enjoyed 25 years ago. Surveys suggest that poverty has worsened in recent years and&#13;
unemployment i s estimated at about 30%. Today, most Iraqis have limited access to essential basic&#13;
services, including electricity, water supply, sanitation, and refuse collection. Electricity supply, upon&#13;
which essential services such as water supply, sanitation and hospitals rely, remains unreliable. In&#13;
1990, prior to the Gulf War, the total installed generating capacity was 9,295MW with a peak demand&#13;
of about 5,100 MW. Approximately 87% of the population had access to electricity. A combination&#13;
of wars, sanctions, looting and vandalism has, however, severely affected the entire power system&#13;
infrastructure in Iraq. Duringthe 1991Gulf War the electricity system suffered severe damage: several&#13;
transmission lines were put out of service, substations were damaged, and power generation&#13;
equipment was the most severely affected. The available capacity was reduced to 2,325MW and&#13;
power cuts of up to fifteen hours or more were common2. In some areas there was no supply at all.&#13;
Currently available generating capacity i s inthe range of 3,600 to 4,50OMW, against a peak demand in&#13;
the summer of 2006 of 9,600MW. Only about 80% of the population currently has access to&#13;
electricity, and the reliability of supply i s poor. In November 2006, electricity available from the main&#13;
grid averaged about 7 hours per day in Baghdad and about 10 hours a day nationwide. The situation&#13;
has not substantially changed.&#13;
&#13;
InternationalResponse&#13;
&#13;
2.       During the summer of 2003, at the request of the international community, the World Bank&#13;
and the United Nations produced a joint United Nations/World Bank Iraq Needs Assessment. The&#13;
total reconstruction needs, excluding oil and security expenditures, were estimated at around US$35.8&#13;
billion. The report served as a basis for an International Donor Conference in Madrid in October of&#13;
2003, where donors pledged about US$32 billion for the period 2004-2007. The United Nations and&#13;
the World Bank each established multi-donor trust funds. Most of the funds deposited in the trust&#13;
funds have beencommitted to projects that are being implemented.&#13;
&#13;
3.       The major donor to the power sector i s the United States (US) which has earmarked about&#13;
US$4.3 billion for the electricity sector3. About US$1.6 billion i s being spent on generation, US$1.7&#13;
billion on transmission and controls and about US$l billion on distribution. The United Nations&#13;
Development Program through the UN Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) i s spending about US$170 million on&#13;
various projects in the power sector, and Japanese bilateral grant assistancei s providing about US$200&#13;
&#13;
2 United Nations/World Bank Joint Iraq NeedsAssessment: Electricity (p. 1) October 2003.&#13;
&#13;
  The original allocation was US$5.5 billion, but US$1.2 billion was reallocated to address security issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
million. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation has in principle allocated up to about US$1.5&#13;
billion to the electricity sector. The United Kingdom's Department for International Development&#13;
currently has US$120 million committed to emergency infrastructure projects in power, water, fuel&#13;
supply, and sanitation in southern Iraq. It i s expected that the power supply situation will improve as a&#13;
result of these investments, particularly if the fuel supply can be appropriately addressed. However,&#13;
the quantity and quality of supply remains highly unsatisfactory and major investment are still needed&#13;
to restore power supply to acceptablelevels.&#13;
&#13;
4.'      The reconstruction of Iraqhas been hampered by a number of hurdles, includinggovernment&#13;
bureaucracy, corruption, and security concerns. More than three years since the invasion, Iraqis still&#13;
complain of a lack of electricity.&#13;
&#13;
5.       The Ministry of Electricity (MOE) reports that many of its projects funded by the Iraq Relief&#13;
and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF) are still not fully completed. This i s due to a number of factors&#13;
including project delays, cost overruns due to increased security cost, and the constant risk of&#13;
insurgent attacks, which are diverting reconstructionresourcesto pay for security.&#13;
&#13;
6.       The Government of Iraq(GOI) i s preparing an "International Compact for Iraq" - as was done&#13;
in the case of Afghanistan - to provide a framework for the country's economic transformation and&#13;
integration into the regional and global economy, in partnership with the international community and&#13;
based on a shared vision. The Government's reform program i s expected to be implemented with&#13;
financial and technical support from the international community.&#13;
&#13;
The Electricity Sector&#13;
&#13;
7.       While some of the damage of the 1991 war was repaired and about 4,500MW of generating&#13;
capacity was available in 2002, power supply remained unreliable throughout the 1990s and load&#13;
shedding and unplanned power outages were frequent. In 2004, the situation deteriorated again,&#13;
particularly during the summer when demand was at its peak.&#13;
&#13;
8.       In 1999, Iraqreorganized its electricity sector. The sector was separatedfrom the Ministry of&#13;
Industry, and the Commission of Electricity (COE) was established on June 21, 1999. In 2003, the&#13;
MOE was created to replace the COE. MOE i s responsible for both the policymaking and the&#13;
electricity supply throughout the country. The operational functions (power generation, transmission,&#13;
load dispatch and distribution) are no longer autonomous corporatized entities, but were reorganized&#13;
into 18 geographically baseddirectorates within MOE.&#13;
&#13;
9.       The MOE i s working on the repairs and upgrading of the electricity system to provide its&#13;
consumers with reliable electricity. In November 2006, MOE presented a new Master Plan for the&#13;
sector for the years 2006-2015. The main objectives of the Master Plan are:&#13;
&#13;
             Develop and increaseexisting system to cover the incremental power demand;&#13;
             Stop a further deterioration of the system by executing an efficient maintenance program&#13;
             and commencing comprehensive rehabilitation of the power plants as well as transmission&#13;
             and distribution networks;&#13;
             Improve the performance and efficiency of the electricity system by maintaining&#13;
             sustainability and stability of power supply and increasing the reliability;&#13;

             to 3,700 kWhlyear by 2009.&#13;
&#13;
10.      MOE estimates the total cost of the plan for the period 2006 to 2015 at about US$27 billion,&#13;
of which US$15 billion would be required over the next three years. The available resources from the&#13;
budget, donor funding and the private sector may not be sufficient and MOE may not have the&#13;
capacity to implement this ambitious plan. However, it provides a comprehensive rehabilitation and&#13;
reconstruction plan on the basis of which priority investments can be determined and feasibility and&#13;
other economic studies be conducted.&#13;
Key Issues in the Electricity Sector&#13;
&#13;
11.      Deteriorated Infrastructure and Unreliable and Inadequate Fuel Supply. The physical and&#13;
operating conditions of the existing generation stations are such that many unitsneed refurbishment or&#13;
even replacement. Some new generating units (mainly gas turbines) were installed, but they often&#13;
cannot be operated because of fuel supply problems. The transmission and distribution networks&#13;
suffered substantial damage duringthe 1991 war and since the 2003 conflicts. This situation combined&#13;
with the lack of generating capacity makes it impossible to meet current demand. As a result, some&#13;
networks are heavily loaded and are subject to repeated interruptions in addition to load shedding due&#13;
to the lack of available generating capacity. Besides the security of pipelines, natural gas - which is&#13;
the most efficient fuel types for most generation plants in Iraq- i s often not readily available.&#13;
&#13;
12.      Weakened Capacity. Iraqi staff has good skills in repair and maintenance. It has ensured&#13;
continued operation of the power plants despite the shortage of standard spare parts and incomplete&#13;
commissioning by contractors who had to evacuate when war broke out. However, there is a need to&#13;
expose the staff to the latest technological developments and best practices in operation, maintenance,&#13;
planning, design, and contract management to ensure efficient and sustainable operation of the power&#13;
system. Equally important i s to train staff in conducting and overseeing feasibility and environmental&#13;
impact studies.&#13;
&#13;
13.      Uncertainty of Availability of Funds and CumbersomeBureaucratic Procedures. Uncertainty&#13;
about available budgetary allocations from the Government and donor funding has been an important&#13;
factor for rehabilitation efforts not having yet led to the desired results. Inadequate coordination&#13;
between projects financed from donors and from the MOE has also led to delays. Available funding&#13;
from all sources is unlikely to be sufficient to fully implement the recently prepared needs-based&#13;
electricity sector Master Plan. An additional issue i s the need to improve planning, project preparation,&#13;
procurement, project management, and implementation. The Master Plan could also be further&#13;
optimized to reduce the shortfall in financing. In the context of the proposed project, the Bank will&#13;
provide assistanceinthis area.&#13;
&#13;
14.      Inadequate Tarifs, Low Cost Recovery, and Increased Cost of Doing Business. Prices of&#13;
petroleum products, fuel, and electricity are still distorted and do not reflect production costs or&#13;
international market prices. Although billing has been partially reinstated, collection remains difficult&#13;
because of the current security situation. This problem i s further exacerbated by the fact that the cost&#13;
of doing business has been increasing due to insecurity: security costs often amount to 30% to 50% of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the total cost of a project. In the long term, the adjustment of electricity prices to improve cost&#13;
recovery and ensure rationale economic investment choices i s one of the key elements in improving&#13;
the financial viability of the electricity sector.&#13;
&#13;
15.     Institutional Structure, Regulatory Reform and Colporatization. The currently centralized&#13;
structure of the MOE may not be the best option for the future of Iraq electricity sector. Possible&#13;
reforms could start with reverting back to the autonomous arrangements that were in place in 1999.&#13;
However, modernization of the current legal and regulatory framework i s also requiredin view of the&#13;
recent decision by MOE to open the electricity sector to private investment. Over time private sector&#13;
participation in the construction and manufacturing companies will increase if conditions are right and&#13;
the correct signals are given. MOE has to give careful consideration to moving away from direct&#13;
management of the electricity utilities and instead focusing on formulating sound electricity policy for&#13;
creating a favorable investment climate and a clear regulatory framework. The Bank i s providing&#13;
assistance in this area through economic and sector work and through the Public Private Infrastructure&#13;
Advisory Facility (PPMF).&#13;
&#13;
Bank Responseand Strategy&#13;
&#13;
16.     The World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) has financed fifteen projects amounting to about&#13;
US$410million. Twelve of the ITF projects (for education, health, water supply/sanitation and urban&#13;
services, community infrastructure, private sector development, social protection and a household&#13;
survey), amounting to US$403 million, are implemented by the Government of Iraq and three are&#13;
Bank-executed programs, of which two are for capacity building and one for assistance to the&#13;
household survey. After a slow start, implementation i s accelerating. Contracts awarded from ITF&#13;
grant money have doubled since January 2006 and now total about US$166 million. About US$ 74&#13;
million has been disbursed. Contracts for an additional US$ 150 million are in advance stages of&#13;
tendering. This is a considerable achievement, considering that Iraq has pervasive implementation&#13;
weaknesses regardless of the financing source and lacks recent experience with international donor&#13;
procedures, and has not borrowed from the Bank for 25 years. An Iraqi consulting firm carries out&#13;
fiduciary verification of the ITF projects and reports monthly on progress. Three IDA financed&#13;
projects have been approved (the US$lOO million Third Emergency Education Project - November&#13;
2005, the US$135 million Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project -June 2006 and the US$40million&#13;
Dokan and Derbandikhan Emergency Hydropower Project - December 2006), but these projects are&#13;
not yet effective. The Bank i s making efforts with the Government to accelerate effectiveness. The&#13;
Bank's implementing arrangements seek to ensure Iraqi ownership and strengthen institutional&#13;
capacity, which contrasts with the implementation arrangements used by some donors which have&#13;
bypassed Iraqi institutions. Those projects have often experienced serious operational deficiencies&#13;
once "handed over" to Iraqi agencies.&#13;
17.     The Bank prepared a Second Interim Strategy (ISN) for Iraq (discussed by the Executive&#13;
Directors on September 15, 2005), which seeks to guide the development of efficient, transparent and&#13;
accountable institutions as a means of supporting economic activity. The ISN stresses the need to&#13;
restore basic service delivery. The importance of power to the provision of other basic services cannot&#13;
be underestimated.       Electricity i s central to sustainable economic, social and environmental&#13;
development as well as to poverty reduction and is paramount to Iraq's overall development process.&#13;
In this context, the Government of Iraq has asked the Bank's financial support for the Emergency&#13;
Electricity Rehabilitation Project (EERP).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Iraqreceived six IBRDLoans between 1950and 1973, the last of which closedin 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18.      As indicated inthe ISN, Government priorities for the US$500 million IDA allocation are for&#13;
education, electricity, transport and water supply. As per the Government's request that 17 percent of&#13;
donor support be earmarked for projects in the KRG, the KRG explicitly requested that its share of the&#13;
US$500million IDA allocation be concentrated inpower (US$40 million) androads (US$45 million).&#13;
The two IDAprojects for KRGhave now been both approved by the Bank's Executive Directors.&#13;
&#13;
19.      For the electricity sector, the Bank plans to support the Government with reconstruction and&#13;
expansion assistance, as well as provide advice on several of the aspects affecting efficient operation&#13;
and sustainability of the sector, as follows:&#13;
&#13;
         As planned under this project, provide investment financing for reconstruction, rehabilitation&#13;
         and constructionof new facilities, as well as technical assistance for institutional development&#13;
         and capacity building. The Bank would also assist in ensuring that projects are prepared&#13;
         properly, the bidding process i s transparent and therefore attract the interest of donors, other&#13;
         financiers and possible the private sector.&#13;
         Advisory support to the Government, including: (i)    review of the electricity sector structure&#13;
         and legal and regulatory framework to help the Government adopt a structure conducive to&#13;
         more efficient and sustainable operation; (ii)preparation of a strategy for private sector&#13;
         participation; (iii)&#13;
                            preparation of a strategy for conversion from use of crude oil to natural gas&#13;
         for power generation; (iv) review of planning methodology and criteria to ensure least cost&#13;
       * development; and (v) design tariff reform to ensure tariffs are cost-reflective while protecting&#13;
         the poor.&#13;
         A long time relationship with the power sector in Iraq i s anticipated including possible&#13;
         additional World Bank lending to help with the implementation of priority projects in MOE's&#13;
         master plan&#13;
&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
&#13;
20.      Inresponseto the tremendous needto rehabilitate and restore basic infrastructure facilities and&#13;
services throughout Iraq, initial donor support was primarily directed to financing priority investments&#13;
in the power and water sectors, as well as to improving key social services. Despite the relatively&#13;
large resources channeled by the US and Japan for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the&#13;
electricity sector, current power supply meets only about 50% of the demand.&#13;
&#13;
21.      The proposed project is fully consistent with the World Bank's ISN for Iraq, which was&#13;
prepared in consultation with the GOI, and submitted to the World Bank's Board of Directors in&#13;
September 2005. The ISN, guided by Iraq's NationalDevelopment Strategy of July 2005, emphasizes&#13;
the need for rapid rehabilitation of critical infrastructure services and institutional support as pre-&#13;
requisites for long-term sustainable recovery.&#13;
&#13;
22.      The GO1selected the Hartha power plant based on a rapid result approach. The combination&#13;
of rehabilitation and technical assistance will ensure an increase in generation capacity and&#13;
stabilization of the national grid when the rehabilitation i s complete. This project will have the&#13;
potential to add urgently needed capacity in a relatively short period of time and at an economical cost&#13;
since: (i)most of the equipment required has already been procured under the O m , (ii)          technical&#13;
expertise is available on-site through sufficient domestic labor skills and experience, and (iii)      the&#13;
security conditions have been relatively stable inthe southern region.&#13;
&#13;
23.  '   In addition, the Bank's experience in capacity building and project preparation will help&#13;
ensure effective future rehabilitation and sustainable performance of the plants. Assistance to improve&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
planning, project preparation and implementation, includingfuel supply will be provided as part of the&#13;
proposed project. The Bank i s also providing advisory services that will assist in reforming the sector&#13;
to ensure commercial operation and sustainable development. The most urgent tasks include: (i)a&#13;
review o f the current institutional electricity sector structure; (ii)     help with formulating a strategy for&#13;
private sector participation; and (iii)  assistance with formulating tariff policies to ensure they are cost-&#13;
reflective while protecting the poor. The first two issues will be addressedthrough the Bank economic&#13;
and sector work planned for the current fiscal year, together with a PPIAF financed study that will&#13;
provide options for electricity sector reform and private sector participation. Issues related to the&#13;
electricity tariff policy are being addressedas part of the Bank's broader dialogue on tariff and subsidy&#13;
issues.&#13;
&#13;
24.      Given the Bank's experience with infrastructure reconstruction projects and institution&#13;
building in conflict-zones, it is in a good position to assist the Government to complete the project&#13;
successfully. It also permits the Bank to remain engaged with the Government's power sector&#13;
rehabilitation and reconstruction plans, and to play a lead role in the donor community to attract other&#13;
donor financing.&#13;
&#13;
LessonsLearned inIraq&#13;
&#13;
25.      Recent experience in Iraq has highlighted the importance of professional due diligence&#13;
on projects prepared by Iraqis, and the need to bring them to a level of feasibility study at an early&#13;
stage of preparation. If possible, assistance should also be provided to the Iraqis to prepare final&#13;
designs and bidding documents, so as to ensure quick disbursements and rapid impact. Disbursement&#13;
expectations should be realistic given the strategy of fostering ownership by the Government.&#13;
&#13;
26.      Additionally, focusing on implementation arrangements during project preparation has&#13;
proven to be of great importance. The PMT concept utilized in previous projects has proven to be&#13;
quite effective and i s being considered by other donors. The PMT consists of staff seconded on a full-&#13;
time and/or on a part-time basis from various departments within the implementing agency, and&#13;
supported from time to time by consultants. In that regard, it i s imperative to get high level support&#13;
and the PMT appointed as early as possible inthe project preparation cycle.&#13;
&#13;
27.      It is also important to focus on how the supervision by the Bank will be optimized&#13;
considering the restriction of Bank staff to travel to Iraq. The use of local engineers employed by&#13;
the Bank to discharge this function i s one viable option that has been adopted by the ongoing water&#13;
projects and local engineers will also be used for the proposed project. In addition, the Fiduciary&#13;
Monitoring Agent (FMA) will support the Bank in its efforts by, inter alia, visiting project sites to&#13;
check on physical progress, providing assistance to the PMT, monitoring compliance with&#13;
procurement and financial management requirements for the components financed from the Iraq Trust&#13;
Fund Grant.&#13;
&#13;
28.      Early collaboration with other donor agencies has proven vital in previous emergency&#13;
operations, such as Afghanistan. Accordingly, the Bank will provide support to the MOE to&#13;
strengthen its ability for donor coordination and management of reconstruction programs. In this&#13;
regard, the Bank has organized several electricity sector donors' meetings, the last of which was held&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
`/AUS$75,000grant       from the Public Private Infrastructure Facility to review issues and options for private&#13;
sector participation in generation has been approved and the study started in November 2006.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
in Amman in September 2005, to discuss the role of each donor, coordination issues and outstanding&#13;
sector issues. 7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
29.      In line with these lessons, the project design has been kept simple and the number of&#13;
contracts will be kept to a minimum. Support and advisory services to the MOE and the PMT are&#13;
included. In addition, the Bank has conducted generic training, including project management,&#13;
procurement, financial management, and environmental and social safeguards, for staff members of&#13;
ministries associated with infrastructure. This will continue duringthe coming months to ensure client&#13;
readiness prior to project implementation.&#13;

&#13;
Objectives&#13;
&#13;
30.      The objectives of the project are to: (i)alleviate the current power supply shortfall by restoring the&#13;
base load generation capacity of the Hartha Power Station Units 2 and 3 to 400 MW; and (ii)lay the&#13;
groundwork for improved power system planning and fuel supply by providing the tools and other support&#13;
necessary to enhance in-house capability to prepare, implement and operate current and future projects.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectDescription&#13;
&#13;
31.      All units of the Hartha Power Station are designed to use natural gas as the primary fuel firing the&#13;
boilers, but they can also use heavy fuel oil (HFO) as well as crude oil, if natural gas i s not available. MOE&#13;
prefers the use of natural gas over HFO or crude, for both economic and environmental reasons. Natural gas&#13;
i s not currently available, because of problems with the collection, processing and compression capacity, but&#13;
the Ministry of Oil is working on restoringHFO supply to the Hartha power plant. Hartha Units 1and 4 are&#13;
currently being operated on crude oil. Under the current fuel supply plan Hartha will be operated on HFO&#13;
until suchtime as gas supply becomes available. The timingof this latter option remains uncertain.&#13;
&#13;
32.      The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$l50 million. It consists of the following&#13;
components:&#13;
&#13;
Component 1: Rehabilitationof HarthaPower StationUnits2 and3 (US$144million)&#13;
&#13;
Component 1.1: Hartha power plant (800 MW) is located at the Shatt Al-Arab river, about 33km from&#13;
Basra and 25km from the Iranian border, and was commissioned in 1979. Units 1and 4 have been running&#13;
most of the time since then, but Units 2 and 3 have been mostly out of operation since the first Gulf War.&#13;
Rehabilitation of Units2 and 3 was initiated with assistanceunder the OFFP and equipment for an estimated&#13;
US$l20 million has been delivered to the site. The proposed project will consist of completing supply of&#13;
materials, rehabilitation and commissioning of units 2 and 3 of the Hartha power plant to restore to as close&#13;
as possible their original capacity of 400MW and ensure an additional operational life of 20 years. The&#13;
tender document will take account of the equipment and materials already supplied under the OFFP. The&#13;
main components comprise the boilers, condensers, turbines, governors, generators, transformers and control&#13;
equipment. The bidders will be encouraged to form joint ventures with local contractors, which would&#13;
reduce the project cost and create local employment. Most equipment will be replaced rather than repaired.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7 / Most donors active in the electricity sector, including the Bank, participated in the conference held in&#13;
November 2006, where MOE presented its Master Plan (see footnote 3)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Component 1.2: Support in bid evaluation, construction supervision and further support to MOE up to the&#13;
end of the defects liability period.&#13;
&#13;
Component 1.3:         Implementation of the agreed recommendations of the Environmental and Social&#13;
Management Plan (ESMP)&#13;
&#13;
Component 1.4: Incremental operational cost of the PMT such as office equipment, travel and per-diem but&#13;
excluding salaries of IraqiPMT staff.     *&#13;
&#13;
Component 2: Support Services (US$6 million)&#13;
&#13;
Component 2.1:       Consultancy support and training to Iraqi MOE staff in the preparation of least cost&#13;
reconstruction and expansion plans, feasibility studies and advisory services for future projects including&#13;
projects related to securing fuel supply and reducing gas flaring. Priority will be given to assisting MOE&#13;
with completing a feasibility study and related consulting services for the Mansuria Project (development&#13;
of a gas field and the construction of a 2xl23MW simple cycle plant with a possible expansion to a&#13;
combined cycle project) and other possible oil and gas field developments, in close cooperation with the&#13;
Ministry of Oil. Support for least cost planning will complement the development of planning tools already&#13;
provided or to be provided through alternative financing. Such tools would include software and measuring&#13;
instrumentsfor all stages of power systemplanning.&#13;
&#13;
Component 2.2: Regional and overseas training for staff in the technical areas of operations, maintenance,&#13;
planning, environment and general project management; as well as in financial, legal and general&#13;
management aspects of power utilities.&#13;
&#13;
Component 2.3: Independent audits for the project.&#13;
&#13;
Component 2.4: Office equipment for the PMT in Baghdad and at Hartha, such as office equipment and&#13;
operational costs such as travel and per-diembut excluding salaries and benefits of Iraqi PMT staff.&#13;
&#13;
Component 2.5: Miscellaneous short term consulting services that may be required for the Hartha project,&#13;
such as an independent review of project implementation, as well as other advisory services for the power&#13;
sector that may be required by the MOE.&#13;
&#13;
Project Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
&#13;
33.      The project will be implemented over a period of about 4 years, starting January 15, 2007&#13;
through December 31, 2010. The estimated total cost of the project is US$l50 million, and it i s&#13;
proposed to be financed through: (i)       US$124 million from IDA; (ii) million from the World&#13;
                                                                                US$6&#13;
Bank ITF ;and (iii)     US$20 million from the GOI's resources. Project costs by component are shown&#13;
in Table Ibelow. A detailed description of the project costs is shown inAnnex IV.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
* /The incremental cost of the PMT will first be financed from the ITF, but this provision has been included to&#13;
be able to cover incremental PMT cost after the closing date of the ITF&#13;
9 /The ITF Grant closing date assumes that the ITFtermination date (currently set at December 31, 2007) will be&#13;
extended until December 31,2010. Should the ITF termination date not be extended, the Recipient would need&#13;
to seek additional sources of financing for completing the activities funded from the grant.&#13;

&#13;
ProjectManagement Structure&#13;
&#13;
34.     The MOE will be the implementingagency of the IDA Credit and the Recipient of the ITF&#13;
Grant. A few other Iraqi institutions such as the Ministry of the Environment, the MOPDC and the&#13;
MOF will be associated indirectly with the project for clearances and reviews in accordance with&#13;
national requirements. The ISRB has reviewed and cleared the proposed project. The organizational&#13;
structure of MOE i s provided in Annex V.&#13;
&#13;
ImplementationArrangements&#13;
&#13;
35.     The day-to-day functions of the project including procurement, financial management and&#13;
administration will be the responsibility of a PMT reporting to the Minister of MOE. The PMT was&#13;
recently established with core staff seconded, on a full-time and part-time basis, from existing&#13;
technical and financial units. Many of these staff have attended initial training courses and workshops&#13;
organized by the World Bank, UN agencies and other bilateral donors. The PMT will closely&#13;
coordinate its daily activities with the different departments of the ministry, consultants and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
contractors. The members of the PMT include a PMT Director, a project site director, two&#13;
procurement specialists, two project engineers, one financial management specialist, one&#13;
environmental safeguards specialist, one administrative assistant, and one legal advisor.&#13;
&#13;
36.      The PMT will be supported, from time to time, by consultants of different expertise to assist&#13;
with final designs, tender documents, tendering evaluation, and supervision of works. The consultants&#13;
will also provide on-the-job training. The support services component provides financing for&#13;
additional professional training locally or with internationalinstitutions.&#13;
&#13;
37.      Internationalexperts were recruited to assist the MOE to complete the specification and tender&#13;
document for rehabilitation of Units 2 and 3 of the Hartha Power Station. The tender document takes&#13;
into account of the equipment and materials already supplied under the OFFP. Experts from DFID&#13;
provided support to the Bank team for the review of alternative rehabilitation scenarios and&#13;
possibilities for supplying natural gas fuel for the power station.&#13;
&#13;
38.      A MIMwas developed by the Bank in 2005 to assist Iraqi authorities with implementation of&#13;
Bank-financed projects. A Project Implementation Manuel (PIM) relating to issues specific to the&#13;
project will be prepared by the PMT and updated from time to time.&#13;
&#13;
39.      The Bank, as the Iraq Trust Fund Administrator, will supervise ITF-financed activities in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. Until security conditions allow travel&#13;
throughout Iraq possible for international Bank staff, donors require the Bank to engage a Fiduciary&#13;
Monitoring Agent (FMA) to help ensure that donor funds are disbursed only for the purposes intended&#13;
by the ITF and to support the Bank in carrying out its supervision function for donor-financed&#13;
activities. The FMA is an independent consulting firm contracted to monitor the physical progress of&#13;
ITF-financed activities and compliance with applicable Bank procedures.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement&#13;
&#13;
40.      General: Procurement for this project will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 and "Guidelines:&#13;
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and the&#13;
provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. Detailed description of the procurement methods and&#13;
consultant selection methods are specified in the Procurement Annex (Annex 6). The PP is also&#13;
attached (Annex 6) and will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project&#13;
implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. A General Procurement Notice was&#13;
published in the United Nations Development Business (UNDB) and dgMarket in October 2005. An&#13;
SPN for pre-qualification for the Hartha Supply and Installation contract and two calls for Expression&#13;
of Interest for the ESIA and consultancy services for Hartha have also been made. Advanced&#13;
procurement of eligible contracts awarded between January 1, 2007 and the date of effectiveness of&#13;
IDA Credit and ITFGrant would be allowed.&#13;
&#13;
41.      Procurement of Works and Goods: Works and Goods procured under the project will consist&#13;
of supply and installation of equipment for Units 2 and 3 of the Hartha power plant using ICB&#13;
procedures, supply of maintenance and control equipment usingICB and NCB procedures, and supply&#13;
of office equipment needed for project implementation using national competitive bidding (NCB)&#13;
procedures. For ICB of works and goods, the SBD of the Bank will be used. For procurement of goods&#13;
costing less than US$500,000, the SBD for NCB of the MIM will be used. Simple works costing less&#13;
than US$lOO,OOO will be procured following the procedures of procurement of minor works on the&#13;
basis of quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written&#13;
invitation. Shopping of Goods will be used for supply contracts costing less than US$lOO,OOO.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42.      Selection of Consultants: Consultants' services procured under this project will include:&#13;
engineering consultants to supervise rehabilitation of the Hartha Power Station; specialized firms and&#13;
individuals to assist the PMT in project implementation, including establishment of Monitoring aand&#13;
Evaluation systems (M&amp;E),training of MOE staff in procurement, financial management, and project&#13;
management; procurement consultants to prepare procurement post reviews; auditors to prepare&#13;
auditing of financial accounts; and other consultants for provision of specialized technical fields.&#13;
Shortlists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent per contract&#13;
may be composed entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7&#13;
of the Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
43.      Operating Costs: To support the Project Management Team, the Grant will finance part of the&#13;
expenditures directly related to project implementation. These could include: (i)    transportation and&#13;
travel includingper diem allowance for PMT staff in travel status; (ii) office equipment; (iii)expenses&#13;
associated with fiduciary requirements such as audits and environmental matters; and (iv) any other&#13;
project management support costs as agreed by MOE and the Bank, but excluding staff salaries and&#13;
benefits. Some of these items will be procured using MOE administrative procedures for shopping,&#13;
satisfactory to the IDA.&#13;
&#13;
Assessment of MOE Capacity with Procurement&#13;
&#13;
44.      Taking into account the existing information on the overall environment for procurement in&#13;
Iraqand inparticular within the MOE, the overall procurement risk i sjudged to be high.&#13;
&#13;
45.      MOE is currently implementing projects financed by the Iraqinational budget (about US$700&#13;
million in 2006) as well as other sizable infrastructure projects financed by donors. This reflects that&#13;
the MOE i s capable of implementing all project components financed under the IDNGrant using its&#13;
own staff and facilities. Moreover, the PMT, with the assistance of Bank staff has prepared the pre-&#13;
qualification document and carried out the pre-qualification process for the Hartha rehabilitation&#13;
component of the project. The PMT has also, with the assistance of consultants, compiled the bidding&#13;
document for the same component. The Bank, however, would work closely with the PMT and other&#13;
staff of the MOE to build knowledge inBank procurement guidelines and procedures.&#13;
&#13;
46.      There i s no centralized procurement department in the current organizational structure of the&#13;
MOE. Procurement is carried out by each department of the MOE through a specialized unit.&#13;
International and local procurement are closely coordinated with the Department of Administrative&#13;
Affairs and Department of Technical Affairs.&#13;
&#13;
47.      Procurement activities under the project will be carried out by the PMT. Qualified&#13;
procurement staff has already been appointed to the PMT. Some have already been trained in Bank&#13;
procurement procedures through attendance of workshops organized from time to time by the Bank in&#13;
Amman. These training courses will continue to be made available. Alternatively, such training will&#13;
be obtained through attending formal courses in international institutions that deliver training on Bank&#13;
procurement.&#13;
&#13;
48.      Construction supervision and site progress reporting will be the responsibility of the project&#13;
site director at the Hartha power plant near Basra. Overall procurement functions will be handled by&#13;
the PMT in Baghdad. The project site director i s a member of the PMT.&#13;
&#13;
49.      Given that the procurement environment which prevailed in Iraq during the last two decades&#13;
which was different from the norms of acceptable international practices and the legal and regulatory&#13;
changes introduced by the then CPA, public procurement will predictably bear a high level of risk in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the near future. The risk lies essentially in the lack of good laws and regulations, absence of modern&#13;
standard documentation, lack of training of concerned staff in procurement, lack of effective law&#13;
enforcement which would increase the risk of looting and the damaging of facilities, and the inability&#13;
of Bank procurement staff to supervise projects in the field.&#13;
&#13;
50.      On the positive side, however, Iraq has a wealth of procurement and engineering staff that&#13;
may be retrained rapidly to operate a reformed procurement system and use new procurement&#13;
documents and tools as they become available. About eight of the MOE staff already received training&#13;
courses in procurement, financial, and project management that were organized by the World Bank in&#13;
Jordan.&#13;
&#13;
Recommendations and Action Plan to BuildMOECapacity&#13;
&#13;
     -   Two procurement staff will be assigned to the PMT. These two officers will receive both&#13;
         formal and ad-hoc procurement training on efficient handling of the procurement activities&#13;
         underthe project.&#13;
     -   An international consulting firm will be recruited to assist the PMT with the supervision of&#13;
         construction at the Hartha Power Station and in establishing a procurement monitoring and&#13;
         reporting system.&#13;
     -   Series of training sessions and workshops will be carried out during project launch and&#13;
         throughout project implementation. The target audience would be PMT staff and other&#13;
         employees of the MOE.&#13;
     -   The MIM would be adapted in the PIM to the particular circumstances of the project and&#13;
         MOE. The MIM provides standard procurement documents, evaluation reports, progress&#13;
         reports, and filing requirements that would be followed throughout project implementation.&#13;
     -   The thresholds for prior review by the Bank are set at a low level, to allow Bank staff to&#13;
         provide hands-on training to the staff of the PMT.&#13;
     -   A Project Launch Workshop would be held in Arabic (or with Arabic translation) soon after&#13;
         IDNGrant signing. All staff involved in the implementation should attend the workshop and&#13;
         it will be most critical that this staff be assigned on time.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement&#13;
&#13;
51.      The IDA Credit and the ITF Grant are scheduled to close by June 30, 2011 and September 30,&#13;
2010'O, respectively. The counterpart funds for the project are allocated in the MOE's captial&#13;
expenditure and operational budgets up to project completion. The Disbursement Section of Annex 7&#13;
shows the allocation of the three sources of finance proceeds by component and according to&#13;
expenditure category, and provides a disbursement schedule.&#13;
&#13;
52.      The Bank's strategy in Iraq i s to ensure ownership and strengthen institutional capacity by&#13;
financing operations that are implemented by Iraqi ministries and other recipient entities. Trained&#13;
PMTs will facilitate implementation and help ensure compliance with the Bank's fiduciary and&#13;
safeguards requirements.         The project will finance specialized technical support in procurement,&#13;
financial management, and other areas, as needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IoThe ITF Grant closing date assumesthat the ITFtermination date (currently set at December 31,2007) will be&#13;
extended until December 31,2010. Should the ITF termination date not be extended, the Recipient would need&#13;
to seek additional sources o f financing for completing the activities funded from the grant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53.     As a further measure of control, disbursements will be made primarily through direct&#13;
payments. Once authorized direct payments will be made by the World Bank directly to contractors',&#13;
consultants', or suppliers' commercial bank accounts, or other financial intermediaries that are capable&#13;
of receiving funds transferred through the international banking system. Retroactive financing of&#13;
eligible project expenditures incurred from January 1, 2007 until the date of signing the Financing&#13;
Agreement will be allowed up to an aggregate amount of about 20 percent of the Credit and Grant&#13;
respectively.&#13;
&#13;
54.     Project management support activities and payments below the threshold of $75,000 normally&#13;
will be made through payments by the Recipient from its own resources, which will be periodically&#13;
reimbursed by the World Bank upon presentation of relevant supporting documents, including proof of&#13;
payment, and signed withdrawal applications. Both PMTs and the main financial counterparts from&#13;
the implementing agencies will be exposed to training in Bank disbursement procedures.&#13;
&#13;
55.     In accordance with the Country Financing Parameters approved for Iraq of September 2005,&#13;
the IDA Credit and ITF Grant can finance up to 100 percent of project expenditures. For most&#13;
contracts 100 per cent of expenditures will be paid, the exception i s the main rehabilitation contract,&#13;
which will be jointly financed by IDA (up to 85 per cent) and MOE (15%). The MOE will also&#13;
contribute to the project through the assignment of PMT staff and by covering part of the PMT&#13;
operational cost.&#13;
&#13;
56.     The supporting documentation for the expenditures claimed through statement of expenditures&#13;
(SOEs) will be maintained at the MOE and made available for review by Bank representatives upon&#13;
request; any documentation relating to SOEs will be retained for up to one year from the date the Bank&#13;
receives the final grant audit report. The PMT and the main financial counterparts from the MOE will&#13;
be subject to intensivetraining inBank disbursement procedures.&#13;
&#13;
FinancialManagement&#13;
&#13;
57.     The project is multi-financed through three sources: an IDA Credit, an ITF Grant and a&#13;
Government contribution. The MOF i s the representative of the Recipient of the Credit and will sign&#13;
the financing agreement, while the MOE will sign the Grant agreement as the Recipient of the ITF&#13;
Grant. This i s the first project inthe Iraqportfolio that would combine both ITFand IDA financing. In&#13;
addition, it i s the first project to provide counterpart funds. These conditions are expected to create&#13;
some additional challenges to the flow of funds and adoption of the FMarrangements.&#13;
&#13;
58.      A financial management assessment was undertaken through several meetings with&#13;
representatives from the MOE for the purpose of determining whether the ministry's FMarrangements&#13;
are acceptable to the Bank and to help in defining the areas that need additional arrangements or&#13;
enforcement of controls. Based on the results of the assessment, the financial management risk, as a&#13;
component of the fiduciary risk, and which i s a combination of country, sector and project specific&#13;
factors i s high. In light of the Bank Second Interim Strategy Note covering ITF and IDA-financed&#13;
projects executed by the Iraqi Government, the project financial resources, extended through the IDA&#13;
Credit, will be managed through the framework of the MOE systems, regulations, controls, and as&#13;
disclosed in the legal agreements.&#13;
&#13;
59.      Consequently, the following measures are introduced to help diminish the risk, simplify&#13;
financial transactions, and ensure that the financial management systems at the MOE are fully&#13;
responsive to the Bank's fiduciary requirements:(i) the engagement of a dedicated financial officer in&#13;
Baghdad and an accountant at the Hartha site to follow on the project financial activities; (ii)&#13;
                                                                                               payments&#13;
to most contractors, consultants and vendors will be made through direct payment method, while&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
payments below the threshold of US$75,000 will be reimbursed to MOE upon presentation of&#13;
supporting documentation and proof of payment; (iii)   maintain close coordination and timely flow of&#13;
information between the project site at Hartha and the PMT financial officer in Baghdad to ensure&#13;
sufficiency of supporting documents for the malung of the payment from either source of funds; (iv)&#13;
using a spreadsheet application to follow on the project accounts and to generate the project reports;&#13;
(v) having a Fiduciary Monitoring Agent inside Iraq to monitor the project activities funded by the&#13;
ITF. The support provided to the PMT by the FMA, will also help the PMT administrating the IDA-&#13;
funded activities; (vi) the engagement of an independent auditor, with international experience&#13;
acceptableto the Bank, to performthe project audit and issue an independent auditor opinion; and (vii)&#13;
documenting project arrangementsin a chapter of the PIMbased on the MIM.&#13;
&#13;
60.     The project has been design in such a way that the joint financing of contract is avoided as&#13;
much as possible. It is anticipated that only the main rehabilitation contract will be jointly financed&#13;
from IDA and MOE's own budgetary resources. As part of the financial monitoring report, MOE will&#13;
maintain quarterly disbursement plans to ensure that MOE's counterpart funds will be released in a&#13;
timely manner. The financial management arrangements and identified risks are detailed in Annex 7.&#13;
&#13;
Environmental and Social Safeguards&#13;
&#13;
61.     This project is classified as a Category "A" under World Bank Safeguard Policies OP 4.01. In&#13;
accordance with the revised Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment Framework of&#13;
April 2006, and in view of the emergency nature of this project, a comprehensive Environment and&#13;
Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) will be prepared during the implementation in accordance with OP&#13;
4.01. Approval by the Bank of the ESIA i s a condition for disbursement of funds for the main&#13;
rehabilitation contract. Since Hartha units 1and 4 are now being operated largely with crude oil and&#13;
given the potential adverse health impact resulting from the burning of crude oil, a rapid risk&#13;
assessment has been carried out as part of project preparation, in addition to the preparationof the full&#13;
ESIA.The Project will not involve resettlement.&#13;
&#13;
62.     The rapid risk assessment evaluated emission dispersion from the Hartha power plant. For this&#13;
purpose, atmospheric dispersion modeling was used to define potential air quality impacts associated&#13;
with the two currently operational units (units 1and 4 at a nominal capacity of 400 MW) as well as the&#13;
impacts that may arise upon the rehabilitation of two additional units (units 2 and 3, reaching a&#13;
combined capacity of 800 M W for all units operating together). Emissions were simulated for a&#13;
complete meteorological year considering various scenarios (before/after rehabilitation, type of fuel&#13;
used - crude oil, HFO, and natural gas emission control measures) to assess potential near-field&#13;
exposure and health impacts at shodnear distances or within plant vicinity (up to 1.5 km) and at far&#13;
field or long distances reaching the Kuwaiti and Iranian borders. The dispersion modeling was&#13;
conducted usingprimary constituents of concern that are linked to power generation, namely, SOzand&#13;
particulate matter (PM).&#13;
&#13;
63.     The contribution of the plant to SOzlevels can be significant at nearby distances representing&#13;
a potential high risk that need to be alleviated in the evaluation of alternatives during the&#13;
implementation of the ESIA (see below). This contribution added to the background levels, may&#13;
exceedWorld Bank guidelines of daily concentrations of 125 micrograms/m3. The contribution risk of&#13;
SOzbecomes less significant at receptors along the Iraqi-Iranian and Iraqi-Kuwaiti borders (far field&#13;
simulations).&#13;
&#13;
64.     Similarly, the contribution risk of the plant to P M levels i s likely to be less significant than&#13;
S02, at both the near and the far fields, because of the desert nature of the region which i s generally&#13;
associatedwith high background P M levels in comparison to the plant's contribution and exceeding on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
their own World Bank guidelines of daily concentrations of 70 microgramdm3. The ESIA will&#13;
evaluate the suitability of the World Bank guidelines to the region given its desert nature that is&#13;
characterized with elevated backgroundconcentrations.&#13;
&#13;
65.     An English and Arabic non-technical summary of the rapid risk assessment was disclosed in&#13;
Iraq at MOE's website in November 2006 as well as in the Bank's info shop (see Annex 8). This was&#13;
considered necessary to: (a) alert the public and the Board that such an approach is of a very&#13;
exceptional nature in view of the situation in Iraq; (b) inform the MOE, local NGOs and various&#13;
stakeholders of the potential health impacts of burningcrude oil and that the use of this fuel is of a&#13;
temporary nature; and (c) minimize to the extent feasible any residual Bank exposure and risk of&#13;
criticisms from such stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
66.     A comprehensive ESIA will be carried out as a follow up to the risk assessment. The Terms&#13;
of Reference (TOR) for the ESIA are included in Annex 8. A PHRD grant has been obtained in place&#13;
to finance the ESIA and the consultants started their work in December 2006. The ESIA i s expected&#13;
to be completed at the latest by April 2007. The outcome of the ESIA will be an Environmental and&#13;
Social Management Plan (ESMP) including mitigation, monitoring, and capacity building-training as&#13;
well as a timetable for its implementation. Inthis context, the various known elements of the expected&#13;
mitigation measures may include a feasibility study for the remaining two units 1 and 4 which have&#13;
been in operation for the past 25 years (rehabilitation vs. replacement with a new plant), improvement&#13;
in fuel quality (less sulfur content) or the usage of alternative fuel (natural gas), or the installation of a&#13;
scrubber system. The analysis of alternatives in the ESIA will examine such options taking into&#13;
consideration the availability of funds at this time as well as future activities at the site. The full extent&#13;
of the mitigation measures and the cost of such measures will not be known until after the ESIA is&#13;
completed. However, an amount of US$ 5 million has been allocated to implement various elements&#13;
of the EMSP during the rehabilitation of units 2 and 3 including the feasibility study related to units 1&#13;
and 4 to minimize the healthrisks.&#13;
&#13;
67.      In the event that funds currently earmarked for the implementation of the ESMP are&#13;
insufficient including the possible use of contingencies in the IDA Credit, the Bank seek agreement, at&#13;
negotiations, on a covenant obligating the Government to implement the agreed mitigation measures&#13;
identified in the EMSP in accordance with a specific time table, possibly with World Bank funding in&#13;
a next operation, with funding from other donors or from the Government's own resources&#13;
&#13;
68.      The project is located along the Shatt Al-Arab river, which forms the borders between Iraq&#13;
and Iran, and hence is an international waterway. In accordance with OP 7.50 (International&#13;
Waterways), the MNAVP has determined on October 14 2005 that the proposed project falls within&#13;
the exceptions to the notification requirement under Paragraph 7 (a) of the Policy.&#13;
Project Supervision&#13;
&#13;
69.      Considering the unfamiliarity of the Iraqi counterparts with Bank guidelines and procedures,&#13;
strong supervision efforts including frequent field visits would be needed, particularly during the early&#13;
stages of project implementation. Should the security situation prevent Bank staff and international&#13;
consultants from traveling to Iraq during project implementation, project supervision would primarily&#13;
rely on local staff and consultants and other donor partners in Iraq, supported by Bank staff and&#13;
international consultants working from outside Iraq. Regional consultants with branch offices in Iraq&#13;
could also be recruited to assist with project implementation.The PMT will prepare quarterly progress&#13;
reports in a format agreed with the Bank. The FMA will support the bank in carrying out the&#13;
supervision with respect to the activities financed from the ITF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
70.      Reporting to ITF Donors. The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger accounts in&#13;
respect of the funds deposited by the donors with the Bank under the ITF. Within ninety (90)days of&#13;
the end of each quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31), the Bank will prepare,&#13;
on a cash basis, an un-audited statement of receipts, disbursements, and fund balance with respect to&#13;
the ITF and forward a copy to each donor. Each such statement will be expressed in United States&#13;
Dollars, the currency in which the ITF funds will b e maintained by the Bank. In addition, within one&#13;
hundred and eighty (180) days of the completion of all disbursements relating to activities financed&#13;
from the ITF, the Bank will prepare on a cash basis an un-audited financial statement of receipts,&#13;
disbursements, and fund balance with respect to the ITFand forward a copy to each donor. The Bank&#13;
will furnishto the donors:&#13;
         (a)     on a semi-annual basis, a consolidated report describing the operations of the ITF&#13;
                 (including contributions, disbursements, and implementationprogress inthe preceding&#13;
                 six months; and&#13;
         (b)     on an annual basis, a management assertion, together with an attestation from the&#13;
                 Bank's external auditors, concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based&#13;
                 financial reporting for trust funds as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
71.      The Bank will require a financial statement audit of the ITF to be performed by the Bank's&#13;
external auditors on an annual basis. The costs of such an audit, including the internal costs of the&#13;
Bank with respect to the audit, will be charged to the ITF. The Bank will provide each donor with a&#13;
copy of the auditor's report.&#13;
&#13;
72.      The Bank will maintain close consultation and coordination with the donors. The Bank will&#13;
provide each donor to the ITF with semi-annual reports on its quarterly ex-post evaluation of the&#13;
activities undertaken by the FMA. Within six months of completion of the activities, or of full&#13;
disbursement of the contributions, whichever comes later, the Bank will provide a final progress report&#13;
to each donor, together with a copy of the independent review of the performance of the FMA. Upon&#13;
request by any donor, the Bank will send to such donor the draft and final reports received by the Bank&#13;
from the FMA on the activities financed by the contributions&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
73.      Performance indicators for the project have been identified during project appraisal and will&#13;
be measured annually during supervision (Annex 2). The MOE will work with consultant(s) to&#13;
establish a monitoring baseline against which performance can be measured. Annual reviews by the&#13;
MOE would be carried out to track compliance with IDNGrant conditions and highlight lessons from&#13;
implementation. A mid-term review i s scheduled for June 2008 and a final project review i s&#13;
scheduled for June 2010 to evaluate overall project accomplishments. Furthermore, an independent&#13;
MA has been appointed and funded by the World Bank to assess compliance with the Grant&#13;
Agreement, as stipulated in the Trust FundConditions.&#13;
&#13;
                        FINANCIAL AND ECONOMICJUSTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
74.      The analysis in Annex 10 shows that, among the relevant alternatives considered, the&#13;
rehabilitation of the Hartha power station i s the most effective way of delivering the electricity needed.&#13;
This preliminary economic analysis compares the levelized energy cost (US cents/ kWh) of&#13;
rehabilitating of Hartha (400 MW) with that of a new 390 MW Combined Cycle Gas Turbine power&#13;
plant.&#13;
&#13;
75.      The hypotheses usedin the calculations are shown inAnnex 9. The prices usedfor heavy fuel&#13;
oil and natural gas are border prices, and are much higher that the current transfer costs from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Ministry of Oil to the Ministry of Electricity which are reportedly the equivalent of a few US cents per&#13;
barrel.&#13;
&#13;
76.      The hypothesis has been made that both Hartha and the combined cycle power plant will use&#13;
heavy fuel oil to generate electricity. Natural gas may be an option in the future but there i s&#13;
uncertainty about its availability.&#13;
&#13;
77.      Equipment cost in Iraq can be relatively high mainly due to the security situation. About&#13;
US$120 million worth of equipment has already been purchased and i s available at the site of Hartha&#13;
power station. This cost can be considered as a sunk cost and has no bearing on the decision of&#13;
whether to proceed with the rehabilitation of Hartha or build a new combined cycle power plant.&#13;
&#13;
78.      The project will help in the acquisition of needed additional equipment and installation to&#13;
refurbish Units 2 and 3. Bidding for this additional equipment may yet turn out lower than what was&#13;
forecast. Recent bids for the rehabilitation of Hartha ranged from US$95 million to US$145 million.&#13;
US$130 has been usedinthe analysis.&#13;
&#13;
Results&#13;
&#13;
79.      The results of the analysis are shown inthe following table:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                       Hartha                    4.92lkWh&#13;
                                                  5.07lkWh&#13;
&#13;
80.      Hartha has the lowest levelized cost per kWh at 12% discount rate than a comparable size&#13;
combined cycle power plant. With a capital cost increase of lo%, the levelized cost for Hartha&#13;
remains the lowest.&#13;
&#13;
81.      Other benefits not quantified include: (i)&#13;
                                                  the existence of a competent workforce familiar with&#13;
the operation of steamplant at Hartha; and (ii) no additional land acquisition is necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        RISKS AND BENEFITS&#13;
&#13;
82.      This projectwill be implementedina very highriskand conflict prone environmentwith&#13;
elements of both localized civil conflict and post conflict reconstruction. The major risks to the&#13;
project are the: (i) security issues, (ii)administrative turnover due to political changes, (iii)limited&#13;
institutional and implementation capacity, (iv) project sustainability (financial), and (v) unfamiliarity&#13;
with Bank safeguards and procedures (accountability, FM, and procurement). To mitigate these risks,&#13;
the project design of each module will be kept simple. The project will include training and planning&#13;
and implementation support components to minimize fiduciary risks.&#13;

83.       Given the electricity supply shortagesin Iraq, the insufficiency of donors' support to the&#13;
sector, and the huge gap between MOE's own capital budget and its strategic and operational&#13;
targets, the project will increase the Hartha power plant's capacity, which is currently supplying&#13;
electricity to the national grid. The rehabilitation of Units 2 and 3 will further strengthen and increase&#13;
the plant's contribution, thereby benefiting cities severely affected by power shortages across Iraq.&#13;

                                 Annex 3: Detailed Project Description&#13;
&#13;
1.           The objectives of the project are to: (i) alleviate the current power supply shortfall by restoring&#13;
the base load generation capacity of the Hartha Power Station Units 2 and 3 to 400 MW, and (ii) the         lay&#13;
groundwork for improved power system planning and fuel supply by providing the tools and other support&#13;
necessary to enhance in-house capability to prepare, implement and operate current and future projects.&#13;
Rehabilitation of Hartha would be a first step towards a long term solution for the power plant, including&#13;
units 1and 4. Inamving at the long term solution, the environmental implications of continuing to runthe&#13;
units on HFO and as steam cycle only will be studied.             A possible option would be to convert the&#13;
rehabilitatedpower plant to combined cycle and thus achieve an efficiency of over 50%, compared to under&#13;
35% achievable on steamcycle only mode.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectDescription&#13;
&#13;
2.           All units of the Hartha Power Station are designed to use natural gas as the primary fuel firing&#13;
the boilers, but they can also use heavy fuel oil (HFO) as well as crude oil, if natural gas i s not available.&#13;
MOE prefers the use of natural gas over HFO or crude, for both economic and environmental reasons.&#13;
Natural gas cannot currently be made available, because of problems with the collection, processing and&#13;
compression capacity, but the Ministry of Oil i s working on restoring HFO supply to the Hartha power plant.&#13;
Hartha Units 1and 4 are currently being operated on crude oil. Under the current fuel supply plan Hartha i s&#13;
expected to continue to be operated on HFO, but it is not yet sure when the supply of natural gas can be&#13;
resumed, but over the mediumterm this might be possible.&#13;
&#13;
3.           The total cost of the proposed project i s estimated at US$l50 million, over 90% of which would&#13;
be for rehabilitation of Hartha Power Station. It consists of the following components:&#13;
&#13;
Component 1: Rehabilitationof Hartha Power Station Units2 and 3 (US$144 million)&#13;
&#13;
1.1     Hartha Power Station (800 MW) is located at the Shatt Al-Arab river, about 33km from Basra and&#13;
25km from the Iranian border, and was commissioned in 1979. Units 1and 4 have been runningmost of the&#13;
time since then, but Units2 and 3 have been mostly out of operation since the first Gulf War. Rehabilitation&#13;
of Units 2 and 3 was initiated with assistance under the OFFP and equipment for an estimated US$120&#13;
million has been delivered to the site. The proposed project will consist of completing supply of materials,&#13;
rehabilitation and commissioning of units2 and 3 of the Hartha Power Plant to restore to as close as possible&#13;
their original capacity of 400MW and ensure an additional operational life of 20 years.              The tender&#13;
document will take account of the equipment and materials already supplied under the OFFP. The following&#13;
are the main components to be supplied, installed and commissioned:&#13;
&#13;
    0    two boilers, each with 660 t/h steamcapacity;&#13;
    0    six sets of feed pumps;&#13;

    0    two generator voltage bus ducts;&#13;
    0    equipment for a complete water treatment plant of 100m3/h;&#13;
    0    auxiliary equipment, requiredfor connection of boilers with existing turbines and generators;&#13;
    0    one fuel oil pump;&#13;
    0    two process control systems;&#13;
    0    DistributedControl System (DSC) for all four units;&#13;
    0    steel structure for boilers, taking into account that 20% of the steel structure of boiler (2) i s already&#13;
         constructed;&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
                         Annex 4: Project Implementation Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
1.       The Bank's strategy for Iraq seeks to ensure local ownership and strengthen institutional&#13;
capacity by financing operations that are implemented by Iraqi institutions. Based on experience&#13;
gained through the ITF-financed projects, the proposed management structure for the EERP will be&#13;
similar. It adopts the PMT model, whereby staff from various departments within the implementing&#13;
ministry and its agencies is seconded on a full-time and/or on a part-time basis to work in the PMT,&#13;
with support from outside consultants. The PMT model will provide the skills needed for effective&#13;
project implementation, and yet permit the reintegrationof PMT staff.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The Ministry of Electricity (MOE)will be the implementing agency of the IDA Credit and the&#13;
Recipient of the ITF Grant. A few other Iraqi institutions such as the Ministry of the Environment, the&#13;
Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation (MoPDC), and the Ministry of Finance (MOF)&#13;
will be associated indirectly with the project for clearances and reviews in accordance with national&#13;
requirements. The organizational chart of MOE i s provided inAppendix 4.1.&#13;
&#13;
3.       The PMT will be responsible for managing all project activities, including contract&#13;
management, supervision and quality control, reporting, and administration of project funds. Making&#13;
payments to suppliers, consultants and contractors, and ensuring that funds are disbursed according to&#13;
Bank guidelines and procedures will also be the responsibility of the PMT.&#13;
&#13;
4.       The PMT was recently established with core staff seconded, on a full time and part time basis,&#13;
from existing technical and financial units of MOE. The members of the PMT include a PMT&#13;
Director, a project site director, two procurement specialists, two project engineers, one financial&#13;
management specialist, one environmental specialist, one administrative assistant, and one legal&#13;
advisor. Some of the core staff has attended initial training courses and workshops organized by the&#13;
World Bank, UNagencies, USAID, and other bilateral donors. All contracts financed through the IDA&#13;
Credit and ITF Grant will be signed by the Minister or a senior manager of MOE officially designated&#13;
by the Minister.&#13;
&#13;
5.     The PMT will be supported by experienced consulting firms to assist with pre- contracts award&#13;
services and construction supervision. Expressions of Interests for such services have been advertised&#13;
and recruitment of qualified consultant(s) is expected in early 2007. The consultants will also provide&#13;
on-the -job training to the PMT and other MOE staff.&#13;
&#13;
6.       International experts were recruited to assist the MOE to prepare pre-qualification documents&#13;
and to complete the technical specifications and tender documents for the principle contract for&#13;
rehabilitation of Units 2 and 3 of the Hartha Power Station. A total of seven firms and joint ventures&#13;
applied for pre-qualification, however, only one company was judged to meet all the prequalification&#13;
requirements. To encourage wider competition from qualified companies, the MOE is recommending&#13;
to proceed with open tendering using modified post qualification requirements. The project team i s&#13;
preparinga revised submission to the OPRC endorsing the request of the Client.&#13;
&#13;
7.      A MIM was developed by the Bank in 2005 to assist Iraqi authorities with implementation of&#13;
Bank-financed projects. A PIM relating to issues specific to the project will be prepared by the PMT&#13;
and updated from time to time.&#13;

                            Annex 5: Electricity Sector Background&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
1.       In 1999, Iraq, as one of the leading countries in the region, reorganized its electricity&#13;
sector. The electricity sector was separated from the Ministry of Industry and the Commission of&#13;
Electricity (COE) was established by the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) Decree No&#13;
195 on 21st June 1999. Under the Decree, the sector remained a Government monopoly with&#13;
COE responsible for the supervision and management of all the activities related to electricity&#13;
including a stable and reliable electricity system. The COE was headed by a Commissioner, who&#13;
reported to the Council of Ministers and was responsible for policy making, strategic planning&#13;
and regulation. COE also provided corporate services and operate the National Dispatch Centre.&#13;
Reporting to the COE were three regional generating and transmission (400KV and 132KV)&#13;
companies and four regional distribution companies, as well as four other companies responsible&#13;
for power construction, manufacturing of equipment and IT. Key decisions on tariffs and large&#13;
projects were taken by the Council of Ministers, but once the annual budgets were approved, the&#13;
companies had a reasonabledegree of autonomy. However, in 2004, this structure was abolished&#13;
and the electricity sector i s now run as one Government department. The COE became the&#13;
Ministry of Electricity (MOE). Reportedly, the Ministry now employs about 50,000 persons.&#13;
&#13;
2.       MOE recently prepared a Master Plan" 2006 to 2015, which aims at restoring reliable&#13;
electricity supply throughout the country and having a reserve generation margin of about 10% by&#13;
2015. Close coordination on fuel supply issues with the Ministry of Oil is envisaged. The total&#13;
costs of implementing the Master Plan are estimated at about US$27 billion over the period 2006&#13;
to 2015. The Master Plan anticipates improvements inbilling and collection, tariffs, efficiency of&#13;
supply, organizational structure of the power sector, capacity building, the legal and regulatory&#13;
framework and private sector participation, but not much work has been done so far to formulate&#13;
detailed plans. In the initial years, cost recovery i s expected to be modest and successful&#13;
implementation will heavily depend on Government budgetary resources. The Ministry of&#13;
Electricity i s aware of the need to seek additional from funding official donors and through&#13;
private sector participation if it wants to achieve the targets specified in the electricity master&#13;
plan. Improving MOE's capacity to implement projects i s another constraint, which need to be&#13;
addressed.&#13;
&#13;
3.       The challenges that Iraqfaces inthis sector are not only physical innature; apart from the&#13;
issues related to security, there are also financial, economic, and institutional issues, which are&#13;
hampering effective planning and strategic management of sector activities.&#13;
&#13;
Current Situation&#13;
&#13;
4.       The reported total installed generating capacity in Iraq i s about 11,12OMW, of which 40&#13;
per cent are thermal steampower plants largely fuelled by HFO or in some cases crude oil, 38 per&#13;
cent natural gas power plants and 22 per cent hydro power plants. However, over the last few&#13;
years, the available generating capacity has only been in the range of 3,600Mw to 4,5OOMw,&#13;
against a recorded summer peak demand in 2006 of about 9,600MW. Fuel supply problems are&#13;
also severely affecting generation capacity availability. Average daily load shedding ranges&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The Master Plan was presentedat a workshop organizedby the Government of Iraq and UNDP held at&#13;
the DeadSea inJordanfrom November5 to 7,2006&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 29&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
between 12 to 16 hours a day. The Baghdad area i s most affected because of prevailing security&#13;
situation and sabotage of the 400kV transmission system.&#13;
&#13;
5.      The main transmission voltages are 400kV (with a primary transformer capacity of&#13;
16,000 MVA) and 132kV with a length of about 4,000 and 12,000 km respectively.                The&#13;
distribution network has about 12,000 km of 33kV lines and 71,000 km of llkV lines. The&#13;
Baghdad area i s the main load center in the country and it consumes about 27 per cent of the total&#13;
load. The Basra area consumes about 9 per cent of the load. About 58% of the energy is&#13;
consumed by households and about 16 percent by the government and its agencies. About 14&#13;
percent i s industrial load, 8 percent commercial and 4 per cent agriculture load. The average per&#13;
capita consumption has reduced to about I100 kWh/per person per year.&#13;
&#13;
Master Plan for the Electricity System&#13;
&#13;
6.      In 2006, the Ministry of Electricity prepared a master plan for the electricity system,&#13;
which was presented at a conference organized by the Government of Iraq and UNDPat the Dead&#13;
Sea inJordan. The Executive Summary of the plan is attached.&#13;

&#13;
1.0Background&#13;
&#13;
Imge oil reserves and abundant natural and human rcsoufces enabled Iraq to atKain the status of a&#13;
middle-income country in the 1970s. However three MWS and international economic sanctions have&#13;
stifled economic growth and development and dcbilitated basic infrastructure and social services. The&#13;
above factors, combined with deIiberatelooting and vandalism has inflicted significant damage to Iraqi&#13;
infrastructure including the electricity system.&#13;
&#13;
The electric power system in Iraqhas deteriorated from one of the best in the Middle East region to a&#13;
condition where the system has become extremely inreliable. The average per capita electricity&#13;
consumptionhas reduced to about 1100 kWh/person ptsr year, which is much less than the average per&#13;
capita electricity consumption of neighboring countrieb. Compounding the overall lack of genetation,&#13;
the Iraqigrid suffers deficiencies in the transmission and distribution sectom. The dramatic reduction in&#13;
availability of electricity supply to people in Iraq has significantly affected their day to day life and&#13;
ixidu&amp;al, agiculturnl, commercial andother sectorsheavily dependon elemicity are getling worse and&#13;
worse. Inorder to provide secure and adequate power supply to people in Iraq, a MHster Planhas been&#13;
preparedby Ministryof Electricity WOE)to cover the pcriod2006-2015.&#13;
&#13;
The plan has been prepared in spite of the cxtrcrne difficulties in obtaining relatcd information and&#13;
powerrequirementsunderthe prcsentcircumstancesprevailingin the country.&#13;
&#13;

    (6) Capacity building o iMuEstaff.&#13;
&#13;
3.1 Power Generation&#13;
&#13;
The Iraqi power grid suffers larger power shortage due to several reasons, such as the suspension of&#13;
implementation of larger generation projects. deterioration of generation capacity of existing power&#13;
plants due to scarcity of spare parts, p r maintenance, sabotage of fuel lines and lack of trained skills&#13;
and abilities of the technical staffs. The situation has risen to such a level that the h y i power grid could&#13;
supply only about 4500 MW of power which i s well below the national power demand of 9600 MW for&#13;
the year 2006. Hcncc, load shedding is still very common and insome areas supply i s available only for&#13;
a few hours per day.&#13;
&#13;
3.1.1 LoadForecast&#13;
&#13;
The pdniary factor for formulation of power system expansion proposals and their timing is based on&#13;
the load forecast. Thcreforc it is important that the load forecast should be reasonably accurate and the&#13;
growth rates applied are waiistic. Thus the Master Plan is sensitive to the load forecast, yet thc forecast&#13;
is the most difficult assessment to be madedue to presenceof severaluncertain factors.&#13;
&#13;
The maximumload of the electricity system for tie year 2006 is about 9600 MW includingloads of&#13;
KRG (Erbil, Sulaymania, andDuhok). The presentgeneratingcapacity could mect only 50%of thc load&#13;
demand at present. The shortage in power leads to impose load shedding and the situation could bring&#13;
back to nomialonly after year 2009 with the implementation of proposalsin the Master Plan.&#13;
&#13;
Analysis has shown that the compound loads will grow at a rate of 7% pcr annum as an average. With&#13;
this growth rate, the present demand will double at the year 2015. I"ig.3.1 d-kowsthe power balance for&#13;

3.1.3 ic'uclSupply Requirement for the Operationof Power Plants&#13;
&#13;
'I'he Ministry of Oil (MOO) has reviewed the 10-year Masrer Plan, particularly the fuelloil requirement&#13;
for generation plants prepared by the MoE. MOOhas wmslyxed the requirement of various types of oil,&#13;
fuel andgas for the operationof existing andproposedpower plantsup to the year 2015. MoEandMoO&#13;
have closely coordinated the plant retirement plans of power stations arid refineriedgas stations and&#13;
prepared the fuel supply plans accordingly. MOOhas prcparedcost estimates and investment plans to&#13;
reinforce and develop the oil processing and distribution facilities to meel the fuel/oil requirement of&#13;
MoEprojects.&#13;
&#13;
3.2 Power Transmission&#13;
&#13;
la order to provide the clectricity to customers, the bulk power from generating stations has to be&#13;
transmitted to grid substations which are situated away from Generation stations. The transmission&#13;
network in Iraq is configured to receive supply through 400 kV and 132 k V lines. The mnsmission&#13;
network i s prcscntly expmlencing several problems such as frequent failures due to lack of maintenance,&#13;
overloading of some lines espially durmg outages.&#13;
&#13;
A large number of substations, originally planned and designedgeographically to cover most of the load&#13;
centers in the areas are old and badly vandalized during and after the disturbances. Hence, the&#13;
transmission network inIraqshould be rehabilitated and upgraded to bringthe generatedpower from the&#13;
existing as well proposed power plants to the Ioad mnters. Necessary upgrading and new line additions&#13;
have been identified in the Mkqtcr Plan and the summary of the proposed lransmissionsystem is given&#13;
intable 3.3 &amp; table 3.4 below.&#13;

3.3 Dish.ibutionSystem&#13;
The distribution systemconsists of 33 kV, 11k V *andlow voltage (400 V) lines. The responsibilities of&#13;
 Distribution General Directorates are delivery of power supply to consumers in all categories;&#13;
domestic, industrial commercial, agricultural and governmental, according to the consumer agreement&#13;
 and opcration and maintenance of the distribution network to ensure continuous and stable power&#13;
 supply to the consumers.&#13;
&#13;
 However, the distribution system has suffered severely from a lack of spares, little or no preventive&#13;
 maintenance for a number of years and insufficient augmcntation to cater for new loads. As a result,&#13;
 supply is stili extremely unreliable. Network voltage levels are ofm outside accepted limits, technical&#13;
 and non-technical losses itrt: very high and bwakdowns are carnmonplace. Properly planned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

rehabilitation, developrncnt and expansion of Iraqi electricity distribution system have become of the&#13;
utmostimportance. Inorder to addressthe aboveproblems following proposals havebeen identified in&#13;
the MasterPlan.&#13;

&#13;
3.4 Controlandcommunications&#13;
&#13;
The control and communications system plays a vital role in power system operation.&#13;
The control centers monitor andcontrol electrical substations, power plants and transmission lines inthe&#13;
substations while the communication system ensure the ffow of information to the control centers for&#13;
their operation.&#13;
&#13;
The requirement of a proper control and communication system is addresscd in the Master PIan and&#13;
following proposals have been included to establish a National Dispatch Center             and 3 Regional&#13;
Control Centers (KCC) during 2006-2010. Furthermore, wireless microwave systems for entire country&#13;
and communication system for RCCs also are identified in the Master Plan. During 2011-2015, it is&#13;
proposed to establishFiber Optic Round Wire (FOGW) communication systemfor MoE.&#13;

3.5 EnvironmentalImpact Assessment of the formulated Projects&#13;
&#13;
Importance of environmental impact assessment during construction and operation o f elechical&#13;
installations in the power systmi (generation, transmission and distrihntion) to achieve sustained&#13;
development of the power sector has been recognized.&#13;
&#13;
MoE has a separate department which addresses on environmcnttil issues and officers are stationed at&#13;
appropriate facilities to monitor environmental related activities. Hence, MoE has committed to review&#13;
the activities related to environment by closely monitoring and introducing proper solutions to the&#13;
proMems in all the activities concerned such as construction, optxation and maintenance of pawer&#13;
plants, to caoperate with national institutes involved in the environmental issues and to buildcapacity of&#13;
the MoEpersonnelworking in the related areas to manageenvironmental impacts control plans.&#13;
&#13;
3.6 Capacity 'Building&#13;
&#13;
In order to ensure thc rehabilitation and sustained development of electric power system in Iraq, the&#13;
skills of the MoE!staff, amounting to about 7500, nced to be improved while investment activitics are&#13;
being conducted in parallel, This has been identified as a priority, since most efforts made so far are&#13;
being targeted on the execution of projects in Ihe generation, transmission and distribution systems. A&#13;
plan has been developed and prepared for training of staff in electricity generatian, transmission and&#13;
distribution a~asfor the execution of rehabilitation and new projects. Required facilities for training&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Procurement ArrangementsandProcurementSchedule&#13;
&#13;
1.       Procurement for this project will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's Guidelines:&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated May 2004, Guidelines: Selection and&#13;
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, dated May 2004, and the provisions stipulated in&#13;
the Financing Agreement. For each contract to be financed by the Credit and the ITF, the procurement&#13;
methods or consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review&#13;
requirements, and time frame are reflected in the Procurement Plan (PP). The PP will be updated, as&#13;
required, to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. A&#13;
General Procurement Notice was published in the United Nations Development Business (UN&#13;
Development Business on-line) on October 31, 2005 and will be revised after the project i s approved by&#13;
the Bank's Board of Executive Directors.&#13;
&#13;
2.       To simplify the procurement process, the number of contracts will be minimized. To facilitate&#13;
project implementation, MOE will hire qualified consulting firms and individual consultants to assist&#13;
them to implement all project components, including training on procurement and project management,&#13;
supervision of the principle contract for rehabilitation of Hartha Power Station and supervision of goods&#13;
and works contracts for the environmental mitigation measures.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Procurement of Works.        Works procured under this project will include the supply and&#13;
installation of equipment for rehabilitation of Units 2 and 3 of the Hartha Power Station using ICB&#13;
procedures, and supply and installation of goods for the environmentalmitigation measures. Procurement&#13;
of works will be mainly carried out using ICB and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures.&#13;
Works estimated to cost more than US$5 million equivalent per contract will be procured using&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. The NCB standard bidding documents for&#13;
procurement of works, which were prepared as part of the MIM, will be used for other works. Simple&#13;
works costing less than US$lOO,OOO will be procured following procedures of minor works on the basis&#13;
of quotations obtained from three qualified contractors in responseto a written invitation.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Procurement of Goods. Goods procured under this project will include control and testing&#13;
equipment, equipment for the environmental mitigation measures, IT and office furniture, vehicles, and&#13;
other equipment and supplies needed for project implementation. Procurement will be done using the&#13;
Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for all ICB. The NCB SDB for procurement of goods,&#13;
which were prepared as part of the MIM, will be used for contracts estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$200,000. Shopping procedures will be used for procurement of goods of small value estimated at&#13;
US$lOO,OOO or less per contract.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Selection of Consultants. Consultants' services procured under this project will include: (i)&#13;
selection of consultants to provide engineering services, such as reviewing, updating and finalizing&#13;
detailed designs, preparing tender documents, and construction supervision; and (ii)    selecting specialized&#13;
consulting firms and individuals to assist the PMT in project implementation, and training of staff on&#13;
procurement, financial management, project management and other technical fields, as needed. The&#13;
selection method will mainly be a Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) and advertising for&#13;
expressions of interest (EOI) in the UNDB and local newspapers. International consulting firms may not&#13;
be interested in some contracts while the security situation i s volatile. Accordingly, it i s possible that&#13;
shortlists for consultants' services for some contracts may be composed entirely of nationallregional&#13;
consultants. It i s also expected that consulting offices associated with local universities may be included&#13;
in the shortlists. University-based consultants will not be given preference over private consultants.&#13;
Shortlist of consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent per contract may&#13;
be composed entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provision of paragraph 2.7 of the&#13;
Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;

                                                      37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.       Oueratinz Costs To support the Project Management Team,'the Grant will finance part of the&#13;
expenditures directly related to project implementation. These could include: (i)         transportation and travel&#13;
including per diem allowance for PMT staff in travel status; (ii) office equipment; (iii)expenses&#13;
associated with fiduciary requirements such as audits and environmental matters and (iv) any other&#13;
project management support costs as agreed by MOE and the Bank, but excluding staff salaries and&#13;
benefits. Some of these items will be procured using MOE administrative procedures for shopping,&#13;
satisfactory to the IDA.&#13;
&#13;
7.       Assessment of MOE Capacity to Implement Procurement. An assessment of the MOE capacity&#13;
to implement procurement was prepared by Nazaneen Ali, local procurement staff, and reviewed by&#13;
A. Amir Al-Khafaji, PAS. This assessment is based on discussion with MOE staff and the findings of the&#13;
.OPRfor Iraq prepared in 2005. The standard agency procurement assessment report is available in the&#13;
ProjectFile.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Procurement Risk Assessment, The procurement risk i s rated high. The risks with procurement&#13;
were identified and documented inthe MOE procurement capacity assessment. They included: (i)               the lack&#13;
of adequate procurement laws and regulations, and of modem documentation practices; (ii)                 poor habits&#13;
acquired by procurement staff from the previous era, which will take time to modify; (iii) limited&#13;
experience of procurement staff in the use of Bank procurement guidelines and international sound&#13;
procurement practice; (iv) limited access of international Bank procurement staff to supervise the project&#13;
in the field; (v) delays in implementingthe procurement plan due to lack of experience in procurement&#13;
planning and the volatile security conditions in Iraq; (vi) increase in prices of contracts due to limited&#13;
competition; (vii) possible looting/damage of construction sites; and (viii) delays inbid submission and/or&#13;
implementationdue to poor security conditions.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Corrective measures that have been agreed include: (i)        assigning two procurement officers at the&#13;
PMT on a full-time basis; (ii)recruiting a consulting firm to assist the PMT in pre-contract award&#13;
 services, establish procurement monitoring and reporting systems, and carry out construction supervision;&#13;
and (iii) usingthe MIMto develop a PIM. See procurement risk table below.&#13;

2. Pre-qualification: Pre-qualification of contracts will be conducted for works contracts estimated to&#13;
cost more than US$10 million. It i s expected that pre-qualification will be conducted for one works&#13;
contract.&#13;
&#13;
3. Reference to (if any) Project operationaWrocurement Manual: The Project Management Team&#13;
(PMT) will prepare a Project Implementation Manual (PIM) by the start of the project. The PIM will be&#13;
based on the Iraq Master Implementation Manual (MIM) financed under the Capacity Building Trust&#13;
Fundfor Iraq.&#13;
&#13;
4. Any Other Special Procurement Arrangements: Advance procurement and retroactive financing&#13;
under this project i s allowed for eligible contracts awarded from January 1, 2007 until effectiveness of the&#13;
IDA Credit and ITFGrant.&#13;
&#13;
5. Other Special Procurement Arrangements: None.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
6. Procurement Packages with Methods and Time Schedule: It i s expected that one civil works&#13;
contract will be procured using ICB procedures. Other works contracts will be procured using NCB.&#13;
However, given the security conditions in Iraq, internationalhegional contractors may be reluctant to&#13;
submit bids, and local contractors, which do not have a history of producing financial statements or&#13;
providing information on their financial performance, may not be in a position to satisfactorily respond to&#13;
bids' financial criteria. This may need to be taken into consideration during the preparation of bidding&#13;
documents by, for example, reducing the financial requirements for qualifying bidders. Goods will be&#13;
procured using ICB, NCB or shopping, depending on contract value. There i s no domestic preference&#13;
under the project. A detailed procurement plan i s attached (Appendix 6.2).&#13;

Appendix 6.3: Assessment of MOE Capacity to Implement Procurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.   An assessment of the MOE's procurement capacity has been carriedout by the project team. This&#13;
assessment is based on discussions with MOE staff inIraq and during the pre-appraisal mission inJuly&#13;
2006 as well as the findings of the OPR for Iraq prepared in 2005. The standard agency procurement&#13;
assessment report i s available in the project file.&#13;
2.    MOE i s one of the largest employers in Iraq. It has about 10,000 employees. MOE i s currently&#13;
implementing projects financed by the Iraqi national budget (US$200 to US$300 million in 2006) as&#13;
well as other sizable infrastructure projects financed by donors. Large projects (US$50- 100 million)&#13;
were implemented by MOE during the OFFP, following un procurement guidelines. Experience,&#13;
however, during this period i s predominantly in procurement of equipment and machineries. National&#13;
and international tender documents and technical specifications are usually prepared by the design and&#13;
planning departments of MOE and evaluations are carried out in accordance with national procedures.&#13;
There i s no specialized procurement department in the current organizational structure of MOE.&#13;
International procurement i s carried out by the directorate for planning and economy.            Local&#13;
procurement i s carried out by each directorate of MOE through a specialized unit. International and&#13;
local procurement are closely coordinated with the directorates of administrative and financial affairs.&#13;
There are separate committees for bid opening, and bid analysis and study, which are most often&#13;
standing committees with members having 6-month appointments; however, the latter may be formed&#13;
on an ad-hoc basis. The bid opening committee opens and tabulates the bids. The analysis and study&#13;
committee evaluates the bids and recommends selection of a preferred bidder. However, national&#13;
regulations allow negotiations to take place concurrently with the three lowest evaluated bidders. Once&#13;
negotiations are completed the committee seeks approval from management and the minister, before&#13;
the commercial department executes the contract.&#13;
Procurement activities under this project will be carried out by the project management team (PMT)&#13;
reporting to the minister. The pmt will be staffed entirely of MOE staff that i s transferred from their&#13;
existing departments to work, on full-time or part-time basis, as pmt staff. The pmt will closely&#13;
coordinate its daily activities with the different departments of MOE.&#13;
Given that the procurement environment which prevailed in Iraq during the last two decades was&#13;
different from the norms of acceptable international practice and the numerous legal and regulatory&#13;
changes introduced by the CPA, public procurement will predictably bear a high level of risk in the&#13;
near future. The risk lies essentially in the lack of good laws and regulations, absence of modem&#13;
standard documentation, lack of training of concerned staff on bank procurement guidelines,&#13;
unfamiliarity with sound international procurement practices, and inability of bank procurement staff&#13;
to supervise projects inthe field.&#13;
On the positive side; however, Iraq and MOE have a wealth of procurement and engineering staff that&#13;
may be retained rapidly to operate a reformed procurement system and use new procurement&#13;
documents and tools as they become available. Some MOE staff has already receivedtraining courses&#13;
inprocurement, financial, andproject managementthat were organized by the World Bank inJordan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Recommendations and Action Plan to Buildthe Agencies Capacity&#13;
&#13;
        At least one procurement officer will be assigned full-time to PMT. He or she will receive&#13;
        both formal and ad-hoc procurement training to efficient handling of the procurement&#13;
        activities under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     45&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 An internationalconsultingfirm will be recruitedto assist the PMT with preparation of tender&#13;
 documents as well as associatedprocurement activities.&#13;
 Training sessions and workshops on procurement will be carried out throughout project&#13;
 implementation. The target audience would be PMT staff and other employees of MOE.&#13;
 A Master ImplementationManual (MIM)for Iraq was prepared by Bank consultants in 2005.&#13;
.The MIM would provide standard procurement documents, evaluation reports, progress&#13;
 reports, filing requirements that would be followed throughout project implementation.&#13;
 The thresholds for prior review by the Bank are set at a low level, to allow Bank staff to&#13;
 provide hands-on training to staff of the PMT.&#13;
 A Project Launch Workshop would be held in Arabic (or with Arabic translation) soon after&#13;
 Credit signing. All staff involved inproject implementation should attend the workshop.&#13;

&#13;
Financial Management (FM)&#13;
&#13;
FMAssessment&#13;
&#13;
1.       An assessment of the financial management (FM) arrangements at MOE and those proposed&#13;
for the project was undertaken, remotely, during meetings in Beirut and Amman. The purpose o f the&#13;
assessment was to determine whether these arrangements were acceptable to the Bank in providing&#13;
reasonable fiduciary assurance that the proceeds of the both the ITFGrant and IDA Credit are used for&#13;
the purposes for which they were granted with due regard to economy, efficiency and the sustainable&#13;
achievement o f the project's development. The documentation o f the assessment i s available in the&#13;
project files.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Based on the result o f the assessment, the FM risk, as a component o f the fiduciary risk, and&#13;
which i s a combination o f country, sector and project specific factors is high. In light of the Bank&#13;
Second Interim Strategy Note covering ITF and IDA-financed projects executed by the Iraqi&#13;
Government, the project financial resources, extended through the IDA Credit, will be managed&#13;
through the framework o f MOE financial systems, regulations, and controls, where they do not&#13;
contradict the legal financing and grant agreements. Consequently, a number o f measures are&#13;
introducedto mitigate the weaknesses identified and render the MOE FMarrangements acceptable for&#13;
the proposed project. Paragraph 5 below reflects these arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Country FM Risk: A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) has not yet been&#13;
undertaken for Iraq; however, Iraq has been defined as one o f the "high risk-weak control&#13;
environment countries" that requires special attention, from the Bank, at various levels. Major&#13;
reasons for this categorization are the impact o f the security conditions and years o f isolation, the&#13;
weaknesses o f the public FM system, the inefficiencies o f the banking system, the very low ranking in&#13;
the Corruption Perception Index for 2005, and the various reports issued by independent auditors and&#13;
other donors, including the InternationalMonetary Fund-World Bank April 2005 report on Iraq Public&#13;

5.       MOE FMArrangements Background:&#13;
&#13;
The M O E has three major general directorates whose functions are Power production, distribution,&#13;
and transmission. It has over 21 directorates distributed all over Iraq. At the Ministry HQ,nine&#13;
departments exist, including departments o f Communication and Control, Planning and Studies,&#13;
Economical and Commercial Affairs, Administrative and Finance, Training and Development, and&#13;
legal. MOE follows the Iraqi public FM laws, including the Unified Accounting System that sets the&#13;
rules o f the accounting books, periodic reports, pre-disbursements controls and auditing requirements.&#13;
The Administrative and Finance department has four sections: General Budget, Expenditures, Payroll,&#13;
and Fixed Assets. It has about 11employees. The Internal Control department, that does both ex-ante&#13;
and ex-post audits, reports directly to the Minister. The Inspector General function exists in MOE as&#13;
an independent system responsible for execution, adaptation o f rules deterring financial fraud and&#13;
corruption.&#13;
&#13;
Projects implemented by MOE are financed through advances maintained by the projects accountants&#13;
and disbursed upon the authorization of the DG at the directorate where the projects are held. Foreign&#13;
currency denominated payments can only be authorized by the Minister, while the DG at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        49&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
directorate can authorize IQD payments up to an equivalent of US$500,000. These advances are&#13;
replenished based on trial balances submitted by the accountants to the Administrative and Finance&#13;
department, in addition to expenditures supporting documents. The Administrative and Finance&#13;
department reviews all projects' trial balances, consolidates them, and send them to the MOF. Budget&#13;
allocations are made by the MOF to the MOE quarterly; however, delays are frequently experienced.&#13;
For investment budget, the allocations are made based on instructions from MOPDC. The MOE&#13;
investment budget reached about US$700 million in 2006, while the operating budget is usually&#13;
around US$SO million. The MOE maintains one US$ account at Trade Bank of Iraq, another one at&#13;
Rafidain Bank, and three IQD accounts at Rafidain and Rasheed Bank. Bank accounts are also&#13;
maintained at the governorates.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Project FM Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
    6.1. Internal Control:&#13;
        6.1.1.Staffing: The PMT is supported by an experienced Financial Officer (FO), assisted by&#13;
              an accountant that will be located at the Hartha site. The FO will         undertake the&#13;
              responsibilities of maintaining financial records including contracts' payments, ensuring&#13;
              timely payments authorization, submitting withdrawal applications to the Bank, and&#13;
              preparing periodic reports and financial statements. The accountant will provide the FO&#13;
              with periodical monitoring reports neededto processpayments.&#13;
&#13;
        6.1.2.ClearDocumented Procedures: The PMT will draft and use a PIM based on the MIM&#13;
              prepared for all Bank projects implemented in Iraq. The manual will clearly disclose&#13;
              each PMT member job description, the payment verification, authorization and&#13;
              execution processes, authority limits, as well as physical control of assets, especially&#13;
              spare parts, and equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        6.1.3.Zndependent VeriJication: The Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA) will monitor and&#13;
              report on the ITF-fundedproject activities (see paragraph 12).The external auditor will&#13;
              report, in his management letter, on any deficiency in the project FM system and&#13;
              controls that i s considered pertinent, and will provide recommendations for its&#13;
              improvement.&#13;
&#13;
    6.2. Budgeting: The PMT will maintain a project budget and detailed disbursement plan per&#13;
         quarter. This plan will be developed based on the initial procurement plan and estimated&#13;
         payments cycles, and revised upon need. It will be used as a determinant to the timing of the&#13;
         budget allocations and as a monitoring tool to analyze budget variances and managecash.&#13;
&#13;
    6.3. Accounting: Based on the number of the contracts and the frequency of payments,&#13;
         spreadsheet applications will be used to record the project's financial transactions and&#13;
         generate reports. Proceduresfor protecting the data and preventing losses will be maintained.&#13;
&#13;
    6.4. Financial Reporting: The PMT will be responsible for preparing the following:&#13;
        6.4.1.QuarterZy Interim un-audited financial reports/FMRs as part of the quarterly project&#13;
              progress reports, and submittingthem to the Bank within 30 days from the quarter then&#13;
              ended. The proposed format of the reports will be agreed upon by the negotiations.&#13;
              These reports consist of a statement of sources and uses of funds by component;&#13;
              statement of uses of funds by category of expenditure; both comparing actual and&#13;
              planned expenditures; and list of contracts' commitments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   50&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        6.4.2.AnnuallyProject Financial Statements (PFS), and submitting an audited PFS with the&#13;
              independent auditor opinion having to the Bank not later than six months after the end of&#13;
              each fiscal year. The PFS include: (i)statement of sources and uses of funds by&#13;
              component, (ii) statement of uses of funds by category of expenditures; and (iii) list of&#13;
              contracts' commitments.&#13;

9.      Auditing Arrangements: An external independent auditor acceptable to the Bank and with&#13;
international experience will be engaged to carry out the project audit in accordance with international&#13;
standards of auditing, issue the required independent opinion, and prepare the management letter. The&#13;
audit TORSinclude performing an SOE review for the audit period covered. The audit report and&#13;
management letter will be submitted by the PMT to the Bank not later than six months after the end of&#13;
eachfiscal year. An escrow account will be usedto pay the auditor after the project's closing date.&#13;

10.     Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA): As required by the term of the ITF, the Bank engages&#13;
an independent firm to operate as FMA for all ITF-financed projects. The FMA staff will be granted&#13;
regular access to the project documents and sites by MOE in order to perform its duties for the ITF-&#13;
financed activities of the project. The FMA i s engagedby the Bank to:&#13;
        - Monitor the physical progress of ITF-financed activities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

         - Verify that the projects' financial management and procurement arrangements and internal&#13;
         controls are being implementedin line with Bank procedures;&#13;
         -  Provide advice and technical support to the PMTs relating to the projects' financial&#13;
         management and procurement arrangements and the generation of periodical and reliable&#13;
         financial reports for ITF-financed activities.&#13;
&#13;
The FMA has already been carrying its responsibilities in the entire current ITF-financed project and&#13;
generating usefulreports.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Supervision: Where security conditions make travel to Iraq impossible for Bank staff,&#13;
supervision missions will be undertaken from an alternative location. Close monitoring of financial&#13;
management arrangements will be conducted through out the project life. Supervision during the first&#13;
year will be conducted about 3-4 times a year. The FO and accountant will get an intensive training on&#13;
FM arrangements before the project start and also will attend all the capacity building workshops&#13;
conducted by the Bank for all projects.&#13;

Disbursement&#13;
&#13;
1.      The Banks strategy in Iraq i s to implement projects though the Iraqi Ministries (rather than&#13;
Project Implementing Units outside government structures), ensuring that appropriate and effective&#13;
financial controls are in place over the use of funds provided by the Bank, while at the same time&#13;
working together to strengthen the Ministries' own financial control processes and procedures. Taking&#13;
into consideration the high risk environment assessed for the project, including the assessed high&#13;
financial management risk, the disbursement arrangements will compensate by continuing to use&#13;
appropriate disbursementmethods. The disbursement methods used will be:&#13;
&#13;
      o Direct Payments to suppliers and consultants for eligible expenditures, for disbursements&#13;
            over US$75,000.&#13;
&#13;
       reimbursement to the MOE for eligible expenditures paid from the MOE resources. The&#13;
            MOE will submit monthly reimbursement applications, or whenever expenditures reach&#13;
            US$75,000 or more.&#13;
&#13;
      o Special Commitments to facilitate payments under Letters of Credits for prior review&#13;
            contracts for the importation of goods as agreed inthe procurement plan.&#13;
&#13;
2.      These are the disbursement methods that have been approved for both the ITF and IDA-&#13;
financed projects under implementation. Extensive training will be provided to the existingMOE PMT&#13;
FO and accountant. Supporting documents, e.g., copies of invoices and receipts, or Statement of&#13;
Expenditures (SOE) are required to be provided with all requests to disburse funds. The SOE&#13;
thresholds are detailed in the Disbursement Letter. The original copies of the supporting&#13;
documentation will be maintainedby the MOE and made available for review by Bank representatives&#13;
upon request.&#13;
&#13;
3.      In accordance with the Country Financing Parameters approved for Iraq of September 2005,&#13;
the IDA Credit and ITF Grant can finance up to 100 percent of project expenditures. For most&#13;
contracts 100 per cent of expenditures will be paid, the exception i s the main rehabilitation contract,&#13;
which will be jointly financed by IDA (up to 85 per cent) and MOE (15%).          The MOE will also&#13;
contribute to the project through the assignment of PMT staff and by covering part of the PMT&#13;
operational cost.&#13;

                               of the Hartha Power Plant, inBasra, Iraq&#13;
&#13;
                                           DECEMBER 2006&#13;
&#13;
Introduction&#13;
Worldwide electric power is considered as an important factor for the development of national&#13;
economies. Its availability and reliability have significant positive impacts on the national economic&#13;
output (GDP), energy security, and quality of life. However, electric power generation using fossil&#13;
fuels i s inherently associatedwith the release of air pollutants that have potential adverse effects on the&#13;
environment and public health. The combustion of fossil fuels at power plants to generate electricity&#13;
produces significant amounts of air pollutants in the form of sulfur oxides (SO,), particulate matter&#13;
(PM), nitrogen oxides (NO,), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), metals, etc. all emitted in the&#13;
smoke stack of a power plant. A large number of studies worldwide linked these emissions to a wide&#13;
range of adverse environmental and health effects.&#13;
&#13;
In this context, The World Bank, in coordination with the Iraqi Ministry of Electricity (MOE), has&#13;
agreed to finance the rehabilitation of two generating units (currently out of order) in an already&#13;
existing power plant located inAl-Hartha, South of Iraq. The operation of these additional two units is&#13;
expected to increase overall plant emissions and potential exposure, but since they will be usingmore&#13;
efficient technology compared to the original units,the overall environmental impact i s expected to be&#13;
less, if compared to the operation of the four original units. Moreover, the proposed project will&#13;
displace distributed generation usingdiesel which have a higher negative environmental impact.&#13;
&#13;
A rapid risk assessment of potential exposure of stack emissions before and after the rehabilitation of&#13;
the plant was conducted with the primary goal to define far field exposure risk along the Iraqi&#13;
international borders with Iran and Kuwait. The results of this assessment are anticipated to be used as&#13;
guidelines for a planned full Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the proposed&#13;
plant rehabilitation.&#13;
&#13;
Project description&#13;
Al-Hartha power plant (HPP) i s located inA1Hartha area, Basra Governate, South of Iraq. The plant i s&#13;
about 20 km north of Basra city and 25 km west of the Iranian border. Shatt A1 Arab river passes in&#13;
the immediate vicinity of the plant. Cooling water for the generation units is diverted through a water&#13;
intake along the river. The plant was first commissioned in 1979 and consists of 4 generation units&#13;
(200 MW each) with a total designcapacity of 800 MW.Each unit has a separate emission stack that&#13;
i s connected to an independent boiler. Units 1 and 4 are currently operational and produce about 195&#13;
and 150 MW, respectively. In contrast, units 2 and 3 have not been in use since the first Gulf War in&#13;
1991. The Iraqi Ministry of Electricity (MOE) is currently negotiating with the World Bank to finance&#13;
the rehabilitation of units 2 and 3 with the goal of adding 400MW to the national grid. The&#13;
rehabilitation of the Hartha Power station, the major component of the Emergency Electricity&#13;
Reconstruction Project of which the total cost i s estimated at US$l50 million. It i s proposed to be&#13;
financed from: (i) an IDA Credit of US$124 million; (ii)      a US$6 million grant from the World Bank&#13;
Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) and; (iii)US$20 million from the MOE's capital budget resources. The plant&#13;
was initially designed to operate on natural gas as the primary fuel. In the absence of natural gas, the&#13;
units can be operated usingeither heavy fuel oil (HFO) or crude oil. Currently, due to the difficulties&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    55&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
inproviding adequatequantities of natural gas for the operation of the plant, the two worlung units (1&#13;
and 4) are operated on crude oil with a sulfur content of 3.7%. As such, the plant may be associated&#13;
with relatively high emissions which will increase with the introduction of two additional units.&#13;
&#13;
Atmosphericdispersionmodeling&#13;
&#13;
The risk assessment was conducted to evaluate emission dispersion from the Al-Hartha power plant.&#13;
For this purpose, atmospheric dispersion modeling was used to define potential air quality impacts&#13;
associated with the two currently operational units (1and 4) as well as the impacts that may arise upon&#13;
the rehabilitation of the two additional units (2 and 3, reaching a combined design capacity of 800&#13;
MW for all units operating together). The BREEZEISC GIS Pro model, an advanced Windows based&#13;
version of the U S Environmental Protection Agency Industrial (USEPA) Source Complex Short Term&#13;
3 (ISCST3) model, was used to assess the impact of gaseous emissions on ambient air quality in the&#13;
region. The model, which is commonly used for regulatory and impact assessment purposes,&#13;
incorporates features that enable the user to estimate concentrations from a wide range of sources and&#13;
can simulate an unlimitednumber of sources, source groups, and receptors. Emissions were simulated&#13;
for a complete meteorological year considering various scenarios (before/after rehabilitation, type of&#13;
fuel used-crude oil, HFO, and natural gas-, emission control measures) to assess potential near-field&#13;
exposure and health impacts at shodnear field distances or within plant vicinity (up to 1.5 km) and at&#13;
far field or long distances reaching the Kuwaiti and Iranian borders. The dispersion modeling was&#13;
conducted usingprimary constituents of concern that are linkedto power generation, namely, SO2and&#13;
particulate matter (PM). Other indicators such as NO,, VOCs, PMlo, PM2.5,or others will be simulated&#13;
as neededin the full ESIA.&#13;
&#13;
Note that emission dispersion simulations are limited by the accuracy of the input data and the&#13;
inherent limitations of the specific models used. While site-specific data were used to the extent&#13;
possible to develop emission and air quality modeling inputs, data were not available at times and,&#13;
thus, assumptions were adopted as needed. Since no on-site emission testing was available, emission&#13;
rates of SO2were estimated on the basis of the fuel quantity and quality. The SO2emission rates were&#13;
found by assuming that the HFO and crude oil sulfur content will be entirely convertedto SO2.On the&#13;
other hand, emission rates of total particulate matter were calculated in accordance with the AP-42,&#13;
Emission Factor document, UUEPA.These emission factors will be measured and ascertained during&#13;
the implementation of the full ESIA and the simulations repeated with the values obtained, if&#13;
significantly different.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Backgroundair qual&amp;&#13;
&#13;
In the past two decades, air quality monitoring in Iraq has been limited and intermittent, mainly&#13;
focused in Baghdad. The limited data revealed consistently high levels of PM in the atmosphere&#13;
(annual average of 225 to 603 pg/m3 with maximum daily levels reaching 1,249 to 8,800 pg/m3,&#13;
probably during desert sand storms), while levels of SO2(annual average of 26 to 47 pg/m3)remained&#13;
generally acceptable. In the absence of detailed quantitative data of emission sources and&#13;
environmental quality, a recent study assessed air quality in the cities of Baghdad, Basra, and Mosul&#13;
by using a Decision Support System (DSS). While reportedfor different years, simulated levels of P M&#13;
(annual average of 10 to 30 pg/m3)and SO2(annual average of 70 to 90 pg/m3)were inconsistent with&#13;
previous measurements ascertaining the need for field monitoring and validation with comprehensive&#13;
data at the time of the study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   56&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Azkqualz;tystandards&#13;
&#13;
Recent Iraqi ambient air quality standards for PM and SO2have been proposed by the Ministry of&#13;
Environment. They are higher than the World Bank recommended guidelines as outlined below and&#13;
therefore the Bank guidelines were used in the risk assessment and will be adopted during the&#13;
implementation of the ESIA.&#13;
&#13;

It i s important to recognize that all simulated concentrations represent incrementalincreasesassociated&#13;
with the operation of the HPP and as such do not account for background or other nearby sources in&#13;
the study area since such data are not available. Background levels at various locations in the plant&#13;
region will be measured during the implementation of the full ESIA. At this time, background levels&#13;
outlined above for Baghdad are outlined below in the summary of simulated results as guidelines that&#13;
needto be better defined.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The contribution of the plant to SO2 levels can be significant at nearby distances representing a&#13;
potential high risk that need to be alleviated in the evaluation of alternatives during the&#13;
implementation of the ESIA. This contribution added to the background levels, may exceed World&#13;
Bank guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                57&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The contribution risk of SO2becomes less significant at receptors along the Iraqi-Iranian and Iraqi-&#13;
Kuwaiti borders (far field simulations). Similarly, the contribution risk of the plant to P M levels i s&#13;
likely to be equally less significant, at both the near and the far fields, because of the desert nature of&#13;
the region which is generally associated with high background PM levels in comparison to the plant's&#13;
contribution and exceeding on their own World Bank guidelines. The ESIA will evaluate the&#13;
suitability of the World Bank guidelines to the region given its desert nature that i s characterized with&#13;
elevated background concentrations.&#13;
&#13;
Future activities&#13;
&#13;
The rapid risk assessment forms a basis for further simulation and sensitivity analysis for PM and SO2&#13;
as well as other indicators of concern, whereby, site-specific data, stack emission characterization,&#13;
background air quality monitoring, and meteorological conditions are essential to obtain in order to&#13;
better define potential exposure and ascertain simulated results. In this context, a comprehensive&#13;
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the Hartha plant will be conducted prior to&#13;
initiating of construction activities. The ESIA shall include an examination of the direct and indirect&#13;
effects of the proposed Project as well as an analysis of alternatives to develop an Environmental and&#13;
Social Management Plan (ESMP) that provides mitigation, monitoring, and institutional&#13;
strengthening-capacity building-training actions to be integrated into the design and implementation of&#13;
the Project. As part of this process, it i s plannedthat a series of public consultations will be undertaken&#13;
and that environmental and social studies be disclosed to the public. Note that while the full extent of&#13;
the mitigation measures will not be known until after the ESIA is complete, an amount of US$2&#13;
million has been allocated to implement various elements of the ESMP during the rehabilitation of&#13;
units2 and 3 including the feasibility study relatedto units 1and 4.&#13;

 Terms of Reference for the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment for the rehabilitation&#13;
                     of the Hartha Power Station inBasra, Iraq, September 2006&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1. The Iraqi Ministry of Electricity (MOE) is responsible for both policymaking and the electricity&#13;
supply throughout the country. The actual shortfall in generation capacity approached 50% last&#13;
summer (4,500MW vs. a demand of approx. S,OOOMW), despite the ongoing major rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance works on existing generating plants as well as transmission and distribution systems. To&#13;
date, most repair programs have been of a short term nature and focused on improving generation,&#13;
transmission and distribution reliability of existing assets. The MOE's current priorities are to (i)&#13;
improve power supply through power import, (ii)improve gas fuel supply (through the Ministry of&#13;
Oil), (iii)develop new thermal generation, and (iv)rehabilitate existing thermal generation and&#13;
combustion turbine generation. In this context, the World Bank i s currently in discussions with the&#13;
MOE to finance the rehabilitation of the Hartha Power Plant (Units 2 &amp; 3) with the goal of adding&#13;
400MW to the national grid. This project will be supplemented with consultancy services for&#13;
engineering and project management, the supply of testing equipment, and support services for least&#13;
cost development planning to promote future projects.&#13;
&#13;
2. Environmental screening&#13;
3. The project will be processed as an Emergency Recovery Project. Considering the emergency&#13;
situation and the current security conditions in Iraq, the Environmental and Social Screening&#13;
Assessment Framework designed for Iraq will be used for this project. The main component of the&#13;
Project i s the financing of Units 2 and 3 of the Hartha Power Station and the Project i s therefore rated&#13;
as category "A" with no direct adverse social impacts and no land acquisition will be required.&#13;
However, the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) will also include the existing units&#13;
1 and 4 which are under operation and are presently using crude oil. Under Bank guidelines for&#13;
emergency projects, the ESIA will be prepared during project implementation and before initiation of&#13;
construction activities. The Bank has conducted a rapid assessment encompassing a preliminary air&#13;
quality dispersion modeling to assess under the present design assumption the potential health risks&#13;
and trans-boundary pollution to Iran or Kuwait using particulate matter emissions as an indicator due&#13;
to the burning of crude oil. The ESIA consultant will have access to the rapid assessment will be&#13;
required to conduct further simulations for testing various mitigation scenarios and conducting a&#13;
comprehensive sensitivity analysis that will ensure the environmental safety of the plant emissions&#13;
under any operating condition including variations in number of stacks, fuel type, emission control&#13;
technologies, as well as meteorologicalchanges.&#13;
&#13;
4. Scope of Analysis&#13;
The analysis shall include an evaluation of the alternatives to the proposed Project, includingthe "no-&#13;
action alternative" and an examination of the direct and indirect effects of the proposed action. It shall&#13;
also include the development of a comprehensive Environmental and Social Management Plan&#13;
(ESMP) that provides a proposed framework for mitigation, monitoring, and institutional&#13;
strengthening-capacity building actions to be integrated into the design and implementation of the&#13;
Project. As part of this process, it is planned that a series of public consultations will be undertaken&#13;
and that environmental and social studies be disclosed to the public.&#13;
&#13;
5. World Bank Environmental and Social Policies&#13;
The TOR have been prepared to support the preparation of an ESIA that is in compliance with the&#13;
environmental and social policies and procedures of the World Bank. World Bank Safeguard Policies&#13;
involve mechanisms for integration of environmental and social issues into decision-making and are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   59&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
complemented by a Policy on Disclosure of Operational Information. The WB Safeguard Policies&#13;
encompasses two main types of policies namely, environmental and social. Environmental policies&#13;
include Environmental Assessment, Natural Habitats, Forestry, Pest Management, Safety of&#13;
Dams, and Projects involving international waters; while social policies include Indigenous&#13;
People, Cultural Property, Involuntary Resettlement, and Projects inDisputedAreas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B. OVERVIEW OF APPLICABLEWORLD BANK SOCIAL &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL&#13;
      SAFEGUARDPOLICES AND RELATED REQUIREMENTS&#13;
&#13;
6. The ESIA Consultant shall conduct a full review of the Bank's Social and Environmental&#13;
Safeguard Policies and related requirements. A preliminary review of the proposed Project indicates&#13;
that several World Bank Environmental Policies might be triggered.&#13;
&#13;
OP4.01 Environmental Assessment&#13;
           -&#13;
Category "A" environmental assessment i s required since the project may be associated with diverse&#13;
and significant environmental impacts during the construction and operation phases. The&#13;
environmental assessment should include an analysis of the potential positive and negative physical,&#13;
biological, socio-economic, and cultural property impacts from the proposed Project. It should identify&#13;
and evaluate direct, indirect and cumulative impacts from the proposed Project inthe zone of influence&#13;
to be definedby the Consultant and would extend beyond the plant area to include also trans-boundary&#13;
pollutants as the power plant is near the Iranian and Kuwaiti borders. Under current procedures of the&#13;
World Bank, all environmental assessments for category "A" projects require that the studies be&#13;
prepared by an independent consultant that has no conflict of interest resulting from having been the&#13;
lead consultant and/or member of a consortium or joint venture responsible for undertaking the&#13;
feasibility and designstudies for the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
OP4.12 International waters&#13;
           -&#13;
The Al-Hartha Power Stationpumpscooling water from the Shatt Al-Arab waterway and discharged it&#13;
back after usage to the same location. Shatt Al-Arab i s considered an International waterway between&#13;
Iraq and Iran thus triggering the Bank's Safeguard policy OP/BP 7.50 on the subject matter. Therefore,&#13;
it i s requiredto ascertain whether riparian agreements are inplace and to ensure that riparian states are&#13;
informed of and do not object to project interventions. It should be noted that the volume of pumped&#13;
water and the quality of discharged effluent are not known or have not been reported to be at issue&#13;
between the riparian countries inthe past.&#13;
&#13;
7. Inaddition, another World Bank policy or consideration that i s necessary in a project of this scope&#13;
include:&#13;
&#13;
BP 17.50 -Disclosure of OperationalInformation&#13;
The proposed Project i s subject to the provisions of this Policy and other related World Bank&#13;
requirements concerning the disclosure of environmental and social information. These requirements&#13;
include making the ESIA and its supporting studies available in draft and final versions at the World&#13;
Bank, Washington, D.C., and with involved governmental authorities (Ministries of Electricity, Oil,&#13;
Environment, Water and Agriculture) within Iraq. Key documents should be made available in both&#13;
Arabic and English.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   60&#13;

the mission o f each shall be included by the consultant in the ESIA report and within the context o f the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
23. In Iraq, while existing environmental laws and regulations may not be integrated within a well-&#13;
articulated environmental policy framework, analysis o f environmental management and legal-&#13;
institutional frameworks and capacities shall be conducted by the consultant and included within the&#13;
ESIA report. It i s important to outline sector-specific environmental laws and regulations and put in&#13;
the context o f the proposed project. Iraqi ratified international conventions of relevance to the&#13;
proposed project shall also be presented and analyzed in the ESIA.&#13;
&#13;
24. In the context o f the proposed project, several standards may be adopted including ambient air&#13;
quality, occupational noise exposure limits, noise guidelines in different zones, effluent quality river&#13;
discharge standards, water and soil quality standards, etc. As such, the consultant shall identify,&#13;
summarize, synthesize, and analyze relevant Iraqi environmental standards and will also use the&#13;
guidelines set forth the World Bank's on pollution abatement and prevention handbook (PAAH)&#13;
which ever are the strictest. Annex A provides the general guidelines extracted from the PAAH. The&#13;
Consultant i s also required to consult the chapter on power plant described in the PAAH. Relevant&#13;
international standards shall also be described and adopted where feasible and applicable provided that&#13;
they are stricter than the PAAH and acceptable by the Government o f Iraq. Such standards could be&#13;
promulgated by the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Commission (EC), the US&#13;
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration&#13;
(OSHA), the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), etc.&#13;
25. The consultant shall review relevant World Bank Safeguard Policies as listed in Section B and&#13;
ensure their integration within the framework o f the ESIA.&#13;
&#13;
TASK5. DESIGN    AND CONDUCT OFA SOCIALASSESSMENT&#13;
&#13;
26. While minimal social impacts are expected, a Social Assessment shall be conducted as part o f the&#13;
ESIA to determine how the Project will affect local communities and serve as a broader analysis of&#13;
Project related social issues beyond those concerning potential impacts and risks. The Consultant must&#13;
seek advice from World Bank social specialists to resolve issues in interpretation of good practice&#13;
guidelines&#13;
(http://www. worldbank.org/socialanaly sis).&#13;
&#13;
27. The Consultant shall conduct a literature review and collect relevant information available at&#13;

&#13;
28. Baseline conditions define the characteristics of the existing and projected future environment&#13;
with or without the project implementation. Elements of the environment include its physical (climate&#13;
and meteorology, surface and groundwater quality, geology and soil, topography, noise levels, air&#13;
quality, traffic, rivers and waterways, coastal parameters), biological (terrestrial, marine, and riverine&#13;
biodiversity including flora, fauna, rare or endangered species, sensitive habitats, significant natural&#13;
sites), and socio-economic characteristics (population, land-use, planned development activities,&#13;
community structure, employment, distribution of income, goods and services, recreation, public&#13;
health, cultural properties, customs, aspirations, and attitudes).&#13;
&#13;
29. Existing basic documents (such as topographical and geological maps, technical documents on&#13;
climate and meteorology, geology, hydrogeology, road characteristics, water quality/quantity, etc.)&#13;
shall be collected, reviewed, synthesized, and analyzed. Additional information shall be sought from&#13;
various government agencies, academic or research institutions, and/or consulting firms. To the extent&#13;
feasible residents and professionals shall be consulted to validate information from other sources and&#13;
identify potential gaps in the technical data. Field surveys shall also be conducted where existing site-&#13;
specific information i s expected to be inadequate or incomplete.&#13;
&#13;
30. It i s particularly important to accurately identify any additional lands that could be required by the&#13;
GO1 for the Project. In such case, it is essential to identify any involuntary relocation of people and&#13;
any individuals whose livelihoods may be affected by the Project. The numbers, locations, and socio-&#13;
economic conditions of the affected people shall be fully documented, to assist the GO1in meeting the&#13;
objectives of World Bank OD 4.12.&#13;
&#13;
TASK7.ANALYZEPOTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTALAND SOCIALIMPACTS&#13;
3I.The potential anticipated environmental and social impacts associated with the proposed project&#13;
both at the construction and operational phases are typically associated with air quality, noise, traffic,&#13;
seawater/ surface water, groundwater and soil, biodiversity, landscape, waste generation, resource use,&#13;
health and safety, and socio-economics. The consultant shall use both qualitative and quantitative&#13;
(using analytical and mathematical means) approaches to assess the potential impacts. In addition, the&#13;
consultant shall distinguish between significant positive and negative impacts, direct and indirect&#13;
impacts, and immediate and long-term impacts as well as identify impacts, which are unavoidable or&#13;
irreversible.&#13;
&#13;
32. The assessment of impacts i s directly related to the definition of sensitive receptors. As such, the&#13;
consultant shall identify sensitive receptors located on-site and its surroundings and assess each&#13;
potential impact separately in the air shed and watershed of the project&#13;
&#13;
33. For each impact being identified,the following shall be provided:&#13;
&#13;
    Description of the major issues&#13;
    Documentationof the cause and effect relationships between planned project activities&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
   Description of methods usedto predict impacts&#13;
   Assessment of significance of predicted direct, indirect, cumulative and trans-boundary impacts&#13;
   and their relative risks&#13;
   Methods or approachesto assigning impact significance&#13;
   Justification for the choice of methods used to predictenvironmental impacts&#13;
&#13;
34. Although not exhaustive, the following factors, which may have environmental impacts, shall be&#13;
considered in the ESIAfor all phases of the project namely, construction and operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Task 7.1. Air quality&#13;
&#13;
35. The consultant shall assess at least the following air quality impacts using three types of fuel or a&#13;
combination thereof; Namely crude only, HFO and natural gas. The Consultant will also carry out a&#13;
dispersion model of the major pollutants ( PMlO and PM2.5, SOX, NOx, and Polycyclic aromatic&#13;
hydrocarbons ( PAH)&#13;
   Emissions from construction activities&#13;
   Emissions from construction equipment and trucks&#13;
   Stack emissions&#13;
   The introduction of natural gas to the Power Station is expected to have significant positive impacts&#13;
   on the environment, notably on air quality, by replacing other fuels which combustion i s inherently&#13;
   associatedwith highemission rates of a variety of air pollutants (carbon oxides, sulfur oxides,&#13;
   nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, hydrocarbons, etc). Inthis respect, the consultant shall assess&#13;
   the positive impact on air quality resulting from shifting the power station to natural gas.&#13;
   Accidental gas / fuel leaks at pipelines, compressor stations, and regulating stations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Task 7.2. Noise&#13;

&#13;
48. The ESMP consists of the recommended actions to mitigate both the environmental and social&#13;
issues. The ESMP consists of two discrete sections. which are described in detail below:&#13;
&#13;
   Resettlement and Land Acquisition Plan&#13;
   EnvironmentalManagement Plan&#13;
&#13;
Task 9. Resettlementand Land Acquisition Policy Framework and Plan&#13;
&#13;
49. If OD 4.12 i s triggered, the Consultant shall develop a project-specific Resettlement and Land&#13;
Acquisition Policy Framework, as well as a Resettlement and Land Acquisition Plan. This Policy&#13;
Framework will provide a detailed review of the potential need for involuntary resettlement and the&#13;
general approach, procedures and general principles of compensation for residents, relocations,&#13;
compensation for the involuntary acquisition of land, compensation for temporary disruption,&#13;
compensation for damage to crops, and compensation and/or costs for removal and replacement of&#13;
plantings. The Resettlement and Land Acquisition Plan shall also provide detailed involuntary&#13;
resettlement cost estimates (including entitlements of different categories of affected people) that need&#13;
to be included in the project and incorporated into the overall project budget.&#13;
&#13;
50. Any required land acquisition additional to that already owned by the Power Station shall be&#13;
included in the Resettlement and Land Acquisition Plan by the Consultant so as to comply with World&#13;
Bank OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement. The Resettlement and Land Acquisition Plan shall be&#13;
based on up-to-date and reliable information regardingthe scale of the proposed resettlement and land&#13;
acquisition and its impact on the affected people, including legal issues involved. At a minimum, the&#13;
Plan shall cover the following elements: (a) an inventory of lands to be acquired and the numbers of&#13;
affected persons and assets; (b) description of compensation and other resettlement entitlements to be&#13;
provided; (c) consultations with affected people about acceptable alternatives; (d) institutional&#13;
responsibility for implementation; (e) a timetable and budget; (f) participation of affected people in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   68&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
design and implementation of the resettlement program; (8) grievance redress system; and (h)&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of resettlement implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Task IO. Environmental Management Plan&#13;
51. The consultant shall prepare an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to identify: (1) the&#13;
mitigation measures that address the identified potentially adverse impacts, (2) the monitoring&#13;
program that verifies compliance with the recommended mitigation measures and that monitors for&#13;
unanticipated impacts that might arise, (3) the institutional structure, strengthening and training&#13;
required to implement the mitigation and monitoring plans. The Consultant shall use the format&#13;
provided as an attachment for the preparation of the different EMPtables (Annex B).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TASK10.1.ENVIRONMENTAL       MITIGATION PLAN&#13;
&#13;
52. The primary adverse environmental impacts that are expected with the construction and operation&#13;
phases can be eliminated or minimized by careful planning and staging of construction activities, the&#13;
adoption of proper management practices during operation, and relying on effective environmental&#13;
monitoring and training to support management decisions. The consultant shall devise a mitigation&#13;
plan to propose several potential impact-mitigation or control measuresthat shall earn the project more&#13;
acceptability, by reducing or eliminating to the extent possible many of the expected impacts that were&#13;
outlined above. Mitigation measures are intendedto reduce the effect of potentially significant impacts&#13;
on the environment. Thus, they are highly dependent on the significance of the predicted impact, the&#13;
nature of the impact (permanent vs. temporary), or the phase of the project (construction vs.&#13;
operation).&#13;
&#13;
53. For each negative environmental and social impact (during both the construction and operation&#13;
phases), the consultant shall identify and describe (wherever applicable):&#13;
   Corresponding protectionmeasuresto mitigate or offset damaging impacts from project activities&#13;
   Costs and benefits for eachrecommended mitigation measure developed to resolve a significant&#13;
   environmental issue&#13;
   Appropriateness and cost effectiveness of mitigation measures&#13;
   Technology usedin each mitigation measure, including information regarding its prior effective&#13;
   use, the range of environmental conditions under which it i s effective, and the level of skills&#13;
   requiredto operate and maintainthe technology&#13;
   Time schedule for implementation of each mitigation measure, showing that it will be in use before&#13;
   the project impacts are felt&#13;
   Interventionlocation(s) for each of the proposed mitigation measures (on an appropriately scaled&#13;
   map)&#13;
   Concerned parties responsible for implementing the mitigation measures and the required&#13;
   personnel&#13;
   Definingcompensation to affected parties for impacts which cannot be mitigated&#13;
&#13;
TASK10.2.ENVIRONMENTAL       MONITORING PLAN&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
54. The development and implementation of a continuous, long-term monitoring plan is a crucial step&#13;
towards ensuring the sustainability of the Power Station and associated infrastructure within the&#13;
surrounding environment. Establishing a database that will be continuously updated will provide a&#13;
clear indication of potentialenvironmental degradation that will allow remedial action at an early stage&#13;
thus limiting irreversible damage. The consultant shall develop a monitoring plan within the ESIA&#13;
report. The monitoring plan should be implemented at the construction phase and be maintained&#13;
throughout the entire lifetime of the project. The main objectives of the monitoring plan include: 1)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   69&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
monitoring the performance of the Power Station and associated infrastructureand the effectiveness of&#13;
mitigation measures; 2) identifying the extent of the environmental and social impacts predicted in the&#13;
ESIA on sensitive receivers; 3) determining project compliance with regulatory requirements; and 4)&#13;
recommending further mitigation measuresif found to be necessary.&#13;
&#13;
55. Monitoring indicators of air quality, noise levels, traffic, surface and groundwater quality, soil,&#13;
biodiversity, landscape, waste management practices, resource use, health and safety, and socio-&#13;
economics shall be proposed by the consultant. For certain indicators, sampling and chemical analysis&#13;
are necessary in order to assess the extent of the impact, while other indicators require visual&#13;
inspections and photographic documentation by experienced and specialized personnel. As such,&#13;
indicators to be monitored, monitoring locations, analysis methods, equipment required, frequencies,&#13;
field procedures, responsibilities, implementingparties, as well as relevant standards and budgetary&#13;
requirements shall be defined by the consultant. Monitoring locations shall be depicted on detailed&#13;
maps.&#13;
&#13;
TASK10.3.INSTITUTIONAL    STRENGTHENING-CAPACITY      BUILDING&#13;
56. The consultant shall review the authority and capability of institutions at local, provincial,&#13;
regional, and national levels and recommend steps to strengthen or expand them so that the&#13;
management and monitoring plans in the ESIA can be implemented. The recommendations may&#13;
include the preparation of         new laws and regulations, new agency functions, inter-sectoral&#13;
arrangements, management procedures and training, staffing, operation and maintenance training,&#13;
budgeting, and financial support.&#13;
57. Appropriate environmental management, in the context of the Power Station, dictates that&#13;
construction and operation be implementedinaccordance to the current state of the art and knowledge&#13;
regarding environmental protection. This can be accomplished by hiringcompetent personnel with the&#13;
appropriate educational and professional background and instituting periodic and systematic training&#13;
programs with site-specific plans that are adequate for protecting the general public and the&#13;
environment contributing to the mitigation of potential environmental impacts as well as raising&#13;
environmental awareness among contractors and operators. For this purpose, the consultant shall&#13;
develop an environmental training course whereby personnel who will be involved in the construction&#13;
and operation of the various components of the proposed project will be required to attend prior to the&#13;
initiation of project activities. Similarly, personnel involved in monitoring activities during both&#13;
construction and operation shall attend similar courses and workshops to ensure their ability to&#13;
implementthe monitoringplan.&#13;
&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the project are to:
            alleviate the current power supply shortfall by restoring
            the base load generation capacity of the Hartha Power
            Station Units 2 and 3 to 400 MW; and to lay the groundwork
            for improved power system planning and fuel supply by
            providing the tools and other support necessary to enhance
            in-house capability to prepare, implement and operate
            current and future projects. This technical annex focuses on
            the financial and economic benefit of the project by giving
            specific data on costs, procurement plans, project
            implementation, project supervision, financial management,
            environmental and social impacts, and economic analysis.
