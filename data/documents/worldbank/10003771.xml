            Poor Integration of Water and Sanitation in PRSPs&#13;
&#13;
            With the increased prominence of Poverty Reduction A major premise in the PRSP approach is that the&#13;
            StrategyPapers(PRSPs)insettingnationalpolicyagendas participatory process of developing a PRSP will help&#13;
            and mobilizing resources within developing countries, it build political commitment. Donors and civil society&#13;
            is becoming increasingly important for sectors to engage can, through supporting such participatory processes,&#13;
            in the PRSP process. However, the Water and Sanitation help provide the external impetus needed to ensure&#13;
            Sector (WSS) has been poorly integrated into PRSP and that poverty reduction remains on the political agenda.&#13;
            budgetary processes, contrasting sharply with sectors However, there is no guarantee that this will create&#13;
            suchasEducationandHealththatarelentgreaterpriority commitment. It is still inconclusive whether participatory&#13;
            in PRSP documentation, and subsequently benefit from processes can build the levels of political commitment&#13;
            larger resource allocations.                                      required for PRSPs to become instruments that can be&#13;

            This brief examines why WSS has not fared well in PRSP&#13;
            processes in Africa. Based on a study commissioned&#13;
            by the Water and Sanitation Program­Africa, the paper&#13;
            analyzes the integration of WSS in PRSPs in three Sub-&#13;
            Saharan African countries ­ Uganda, Zambia and Malawi&#13;
            ­ and compares this to generic experiences in Education&#13;

            Factors behind a successful PRSP process&#13;

            Successful PRSP processes rely on a combination of                                                                  Uganda©ODI&#13;

The `WatSan &amp; PRSPs' project was coordinated by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), in partnership with WaterAid,&#13;
and in collaboration with the Water and Sanitation Program-Africa, as well as with researchers and policy specialists in the&#13;

                                        Three common features can be identified from sectors                                 support, because, ex ante, they tend to have larger&#13;

                                           below, Uganda is far ahead of Zambia and Malawi&#13;

            reduction strategy paper (PRSP) processes in Africa. Based
            on a study commissioned by the water and sanitation
            program-Africa, the paper analyzes the integration of WSS in
            PRSPs in three Sub- Saharan African countries - Uganda,
            Zambia and Malawi - and compares this to generic experiences
            in education and health sectors. It provides recommendations
            on how WSS actors can better align themselves towards PRSP
            process and take actions to help the sector gain priority in
            PRSP and budget processes.
