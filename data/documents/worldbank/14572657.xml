As an integral component of the Water and Sanitation Programâ&#128;&#153;s (WSPâ&#128;&#153;s) Global&#13;
Scaling Up Handwashing Project, a crossâ&#128;&#147;country impact evaluation (IE) study&#13;
is being conducted in Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam. This study is led by&#13;
the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s WSP IE Team.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program Global Impact Evaluation&#13;
Team in Washington, D.C., leads the study, with the contribution of WSP teams&#13;
and consultants in each of the participating countries. The baseline data collec-&#13;
tion for all countries was conducted during 2008 and 2009, and the reports have&#13;
undergone several peer review processes.&#13;
&#13;
The projectâ&#128;&#153;s Global Impact Evaluation Team oversees the IE design, methodol-&#13;
ogy, and country teams. It is led by Bertha Briceno (in its early stages, the Global&#13;
IE was led by Jack Molyneaux), together with Alexandra Orsola-Vidal and Claire&#13;
Chase. Professor Paul Gertler has provided guidance and advice throughout the&#13;
project. Global IE experts also include Sebastian Galiani, Jack Colford, Ben Ar-&#13;
nold, Pavani Ram, Lia Fernald, Patricia Kariger, Paul Wassenich, Mark Sobsey,&#13;
and Christine Stauber. At the country level, the Senegal Impact Evaluation Team,&#13;
led by principal and co-principal investigators Lucie Heinzerling and Alexandra&#13;
Orsola-Vidal, oversaw the in-country design and field activities. Helene Benga&#13;
provided in-country research and operations assistance and Ahmad Yusuf pro-&#13;
vided support with the data analysis and write up of this report.&#13;
&#13;
The Senegal impact evaluation has also benefited from continuous support from&#13;
Eduardo Perez, the global task team leader for the project; Seydou Koita, country&#13;
task manager for the project in Senegal; Momar Kane, the Monitoring Informa-&#13;
tion Systems (MIS) officer; and the global technical team comprised of Hnin&#13;
Hnin Pyne, Jacqueline Devine, Nathaniel Paynter, and WSP support staff. Very&#13;
special thanks to former Senegal task team leader, Ousseynou Diop (deceased&#13;
November 2009) for his invaluable guidance and constant support.&#13;

When looking at the types of sanitation facilities (Table 17)                   poorest households (38.8 percent) than in wealthiest ones&#13;
the most striking finding is that on average, more than a fifth                 (9.7 percent). Regarding waste disposal, the most com-&#13;

observed in wealthy households (flush toilets were observed&#13;
in 74.5 percent of the wealthiest households but in barely&#13;
none of the poorest), while pit latrines were largely observed&#13;
among poor households (just 7.4 percent of the households&#13;
in the 5th wealth quintile had a pit latrine with no slab, while&#13;
the figures for the three lowest wealth quintiles were between&#13;
18 to 30 percent). Most of these facilities are located in the&#13;
household yard (42.3 percent), inside the household (27.1&#13;
percent) or have no designated area (16.7 percent). On aver-&#13;
age, 93.4 percent of the households have private facilities and&#13;
only 6.6 percent use public facilities.&#13;

related symptoms, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain or cramps,                 cholera. Second, the DHS variable for diarrhea is based on care-&#13;

The z-score (or standard score) indicates the number of&#13;
standard deviations an observation or measure is above or&#13;
below the mean of a reference population. As the mean is&#13;
normalized to zero, any negative z-scores would be below&#13;
the mean, and any positive z-scores would be above the&#13;
mean. Z-scores are not only useful to assess the average&#13;
growth and development of children against a reference&#13;
population, but also to compare levels of growth and de-&#13;
velopment among households with different characteristics,&#13;
wealth levels, or regions.&#13;
&#13;
Anthropometric z-scores are also used to determine whether&#13;
a child is malnourished. The three main nutritional status&#13;
conditions concerned in anthropometric assessment are&#13;
underweight, stunting, and wasting. Underweight indicates&#13;

3.7 Parasite Prevalence&#13;
&#13;
Key Findings:&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Giardia was detected in over 10 percent of the children&#13;
       stools samples, and Cryptosporidium, another parasite&#13;
       that affects intestines and is typically an acute short-&#13;
       term infection, in over 17 percent of the samples.&#13;
   â&#128;¢ Giardia prevalence is higher among households with no&#13;
       access to a handwashing station with soap and water, no&#13;
       access to improved sanitation, or no access to improved&#13;
       water. This is not the case for Cryptosporidium. It is worth&#13;
       noting, however, that stool samples were collected only&#13;
       in a subsample of 99 households; therefore not much&#13;
       weight should be allocated to these correlations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The survey also collected stool samples on a subsample of&#13;
99 households to examine the presence of parasites. Base-                    Stool samples are collected to test for presence of parasites.&#13;
line data on the presence of parasites in the household may&#13;
allow better future understandings of the mechanism by&#13;
which the treatment operates, whether it is through the                      sources (14.5 percent) than those with unimproved water&#13;

                                                                             lence among those households with access to improved&#13;
Giardia was detected in 11.2 percent of the stool sam-                       water, improved sanitation, and a handwashing station&#13;
ples, and Crystosporidium was found in 17.3 percent of                       with soap and water. Prevalence of parasites does not&#13;

&amp;#12;IV.             Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
The findings presented in this report provide a snapshot of baseline character-&#13;
istics of the target population in regard to household demographics, socioeco-&#13;
nomic situation, motherâ&#128;&#153;s and other caretakerâ&#128;&#153;s handwashing behavior, access to&#13;
improved sanitation and water, and key child health and development indicators.&#13;
Low baseline rates of both handwashing with soap at critical times and access&#13;
to a place for handwashing stocked with soap and water, indicates that there is&#13;
scope for improving handwashing behavior in the target population, particularly&#13;
among the poorest.&#13;
&#13;
The subsequent collection and analysis of the post-intervention data, in con-&#13;
junction with the longitudinal data, will enable a close examination of the links&#13;
between poor handwashing behavior, poor health, and longer-term child devel-&#13;
opment. The baseline survey identifies large proportions of children who are&#13;
below average in terms of weight, length/height, and arm and head circumference&#13;
for their age. Diarrhea is relatively high compared to other Global Scaling Up&#13;
project countries and anemia affects the large majority of children. The impact&#13;
evaluation aims to identify to what extent these outcomes are attributable to lack&#13;
of handwashing with soap and to quantify the extent to which the project is able&#13;
to improve these vital aspects of child health.&#13;
&#13;
As outlined in the methodology section, the impact evaluation study utilizes a&#13;
series of household and community surveys. These include the baseline, longi-&#13;
tudinal monitoring, and post-intervention follow-up questionnaires. At the time&#13;
of this reportâ&#128;&#153;s publication, longitudinal data collection is completed, and post-&#13;
intervention data collection is ongoing and expected to be completed by mid&#13;
2011. Data analysis and impact assessments will be conducted soon after, and a&#13;
full impact evaluation report of the Global Scaling Up Rural Handwashing Proj-&#13;
ect will be published by the end of 2011.&#13;

            Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project -
            scaling up handwashing behavior : findings from the impact
            evaluation baseline survey in Senegal

            In December 2006, in response to the
            preventable threats posed by poor sanitation and hygiene,
            the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) launched two
            large-scale projects, global scaling up handwashing and
            global scaling up rural sanitation, to improve the health
            and welfare outcomes for millions of poor people. Local and
            national governments are implementing these projects with
            technical support from WSP. The goal of the Global Scaling
            up Handwashing Project (HWWS) is to reduce the risk of
            diarrhea and therefore increase household productivity by
            stimulating and sustaining the behavior of handwashing with
            soap at critical times for 5.4 million people in Peru,
            Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam. The project aims to test
            whether this handwashing behavior can be improved among the
            poor and vulnerable using innovative promotional approaches.
            In addition, it will undertake a structured learning and
            dissemination process to develop the evidence, practical
            knowledge, and tools needed to effectively replicate and
            scale up future handwashing programs.
