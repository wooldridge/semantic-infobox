Open bidding processes do not reveal what the   For a standard equipment contract the bidders&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Once a government has decided to award a
            concession by auction, it needs to decide what kind of
            auction to use. For concessions the standard is a
            first-price sealed bid auction in which bidders submit
            sealed envelopes containing their offer and the highest
            offer determines the price. The bidding may occur in one or
            two stages. In two-stage bidding the technical parameters of
            the bids are made comparable in the first stage, and only
            the main offer on the core bid parameter is submitted in the
            second. The main offer may relate to a price, a level of
            subsidy, a payment for net worth, or any other appropriate
            parameter; the discussion in this Note focuses on price.
