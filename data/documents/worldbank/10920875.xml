&#13;
The Regulatory Reform and Private Enterprise Division of The Economic Development Institute (EDIRP)&#13;
conducted a core course on Privatization and Regulation of Transport Services in Washington, DC from&#13;
January 5-13, 1998. The course objective was to provide transport regulators and policy makers with the&#13;
necessary tools to address the main issues that typically arise after privatization. It aimed at enhancing&#13;
their economic, technical, and policy making skills, enabling them to contribute to significant&#13;
improvements in the implementation of day to day regulatory responsibilities and transport policies.&#13;
&#13;
Forty-five participants attended the seminar, which was evaluated by the EDI Evaluation Unit (EDIES). A&#13;
questionnaire was used to evaluate the first week of the course on aspects of course relevance and&#13;
effectiveness of resource persons, and also to compare knowledge of the participants before and after&#13;
the course. The questionnaire used a six point scale ranging from 1=minimum to 6=maximum. Of the 45&#13;
participants, 39 (87%) completed questionnaires. The major evaluation findings are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    ·   Overall response on the course performance was positive. The mean for all responses was&#13;
        greater than 4.00. This suggests that respondents perceived that the course helped them to&#13;
        improve their knowledge and abilities in the area of privatization and regulation of transport&#13;
        services.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   The course was considered highly relevant to the respondents' needs. Almost 85 percent of&#13;
        participant respondents fell into the 5-6 range on this question. Moreover, this item received the&#13;
        highest mean score (5.05) on this section of the evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   A second item that received high mean scores asked whether the course was a worthwhile use&#13;
        of participants' time. The average mean score of this question was 5.03.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   The evaluation shows that one area requiring attention may be "clarifying the next steps for&#13;
        participants to take regarding privatization and regulation of transport services". This item&#13;
        received the lowest mean score (4.69). Course designers may need to put more emphasis on&#13;
        this item.&#13;
&#13;
    ·   There was positive feedback on resource persons' knowledge of the issues. The range of mean&#13;
        scores for this category was 4.94 to 5.49. Favorable responses were also given for their&#13;
        communication skills. The range of mean scores for this was 4.11 to 5.49. One of the key&#13;
        presenters, Mr. Gomez-Ibanez, was distinguished with top mean scores in both knowledge&#13;
        (mean=5.49) and communication skills (mean=5.54).&#13;
&#13;
    ·   For 5 of the 6 items addressing the content of the first week of the course, the lowest score&#13;
        received was a 3.0 out of 6. A sixth item, asking to what extent the first week of the course was a&#13;
        worthwhile use of time, received no scores lower than 4 out of 6. A score of 6 was given at least&#13;
        once for all items in that section of the evaluation. The section that focused on resource persons'&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  knowledge and communication skills showed more variability. 'Minimum' scores ranged from 1 to&#13;
  4 while 'maximum' scores were consistent at the 6 level.&#13;
&#13;
· Comparison of the ratings at the beginning and at the end of the first week shows that&#13;
  participants' perceived knowledge improved. Mean scores before the start of the course ranged&#13;
  from 3.00 to 3.85. After the first week, scores improved to a range of 4.33 to 4.85.&#13;
&#13;
· Maximum perceived gain in knowledge was on the topic addressing the "importance of the&#13;
  difference between role of return and price cap regulation". The pre/post change for this item was&#13;
  1.38.&#13;
&#13;
· The smallest gain achieved was for the topic covering the "problems governments face in&#13;
  regulating private sector transport provisions. The change noted for this was 0.95.&#13;
&#13;
· There were some limitations to this evaluation. First, only 7 days of the 9 day course were&#13;
  evaluated. In addition, the evaluation judged only perceived knowledge gain as opposed to&#13;
  actual knowledge gain. Finally, there is no mid-point on the six point Likert type scale used,&#13;
  which may be problematic for respondents, as it provides no true mid-point measure. These&#13;
  limitations should be considered when planning evaluations of future courses.&#13;
