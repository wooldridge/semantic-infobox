Mozambique Mining and Gas Technical Assistance Project Single-Donor Trust Fund&#13;
(Trust Fund Description)&#13;
This Annex will be applicable to and form an integral part of the Administration Arrangement for the Trust&#13;
Fund between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
1. Objectives&#13;
The objectives of the Mozambique Mining and Gas Technical Assistance Project ("Project")&#13;
supported by the Trust Fund is to strengthen the capacity and governance systems of key institutions&#13;
to manage the mining and hydrocarbon sectors in Mozambique ("Recipient"), for which the Bank&#13;
has also provided to the Recipient a Credit in the amount of SDR 32,600,000, pursuant to a&#13;
Financing Agreement signed between the Bank and the Recipient (the "Financing Agreement"),&#13;
dated April 19, 2013.&#13;
2. Activities&#13;
2.1    Bank-executed Trust Fund (BETF) activities, for which the Bank has implementation&#13;
responsibility:&#13;
Component 1: Costs of enhanced implementation support for the Project. These costs are based on&#13;
full cost recovery and include staff and travel costs for the implementation support team. The&#13;
activities will be carried out on the field during regular implementation support missions and from&#13;
HQ as needed through regular status updates with the client. Since this is a very technical project in&#13;
a low-capacity environment, the enhanced implementation support is essential to successful project&#13;
implementation. This implementation support will set the basis for a future and more strategic&#13;
relationship between the Bank and Mozambique in the mining and gas sector. The highly technical&#13;
nature of the Project, relatively low capacity of the client, and involvement of other donor partners&#13;
for the project necessitate more frequent and broader Bank missions to supervise the implementation&#13;
of the Project. There will be around 3-4 implementation support missions per year, which is almost&#13;
two times more frequent than the standard implementation support for other Bank projects. The costs&#13;
of these additional missions, time and travel costs are included as part of this enhanced&#13;
implementation support BETF sub-component.&#13;
Component 2: As part of this BETF sub-component, the Bank will provide advisory support&#13;
services to the Recipient. This technical advisory support will be provided continuously in&#13;
Mozambique and will go beyond the standard support provided by the implementation support&#13;
missions. As part of this sub-component, technical advice will be provided to the client on key issues&#13;
relating to mining governance capacity building and reform and natural gas capacity building and&#13;
reform. This BETF sub-component will also inform and strengthen the implementation support that&#13;
the Bank provides through regular missions, through video or audio meetings from the HQ or&#13;
through the support provided by the country office. Advisory services will be provided during&#13;
regular meetings with the government, implementation agencies, and Bank staff. While most of the&#13;
advisory services will be provided in face-to-face meetings or through emails, written reports on&#13;
specific topics or workshops/training on particular issues could also be organized to support the&#13;
advisory work.&#13;
&#13;

Donor will bear any responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other&#13;
currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date&#13;
of the conversion.&#13;
2.5    The Bank will invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of&#13;
trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank will transfer all income from such investment to the&#13;
Donor's applicable donor balance account with the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1    The Bank will deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each Installment,&#13;
an amount equal to two percent (2%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2   In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program management&#13;
and Trust Fund administration, that are (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above&#13;
as an administrative fee and (ii) not included under Annex I of the Administration Arrangements in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures will be charged to the Trust Fund on&#13;
an actual basis up to a maximum of one point sixty four percent (1.64%) of the total Contributions&#13;
under all Administration Arrangements.&#13;
3.3    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust&#13;
Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual&#13;
Contributions significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the&#13;
first Administration Arrangement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs&#13;
change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and&#13;
Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration&#13;
Arrangements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that&#13;
are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration Arrangements or from&#13;
new Donors under new Administration Arrangements.&#13;
4.     Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
4.1    The Bank will maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;
4.2    The Bank will furnish to the Donors current financial information relating to receipts,&#13;
disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions via the&#13;
World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website. Within six (6) months after all&#13;
commitments and liabilities under the Trust Fund have been satisfied and the Trust Fund has been&#13;
closed, the final financial information relating to receipts, disbursements and fund balance in the&#13;
Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions will be made available to the Donors via the&#13;
World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website.&#13;
4.3    The Bank will provide to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Fund Donor Center secure&#13;
website, within six (6) months following the end of each Bank fiscal year, an annual single audit&#13;
report, comprising (i) a management assertion together with an attestation from the Bank's external&#13;
auditors concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-&#13;
based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds&#13;
together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit will be&#13;
bome by the Bank.&#13;
4.4    If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank will first consult as to whether&#13;
such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor will agree on the appropriate scope and&#13;
terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the&#13;
Bank will arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of&#13;
the Bank with respect to such audit, will be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;
4.5    The Bank will make available to the Donors copies of all financial statements and auditors'&#13;
reports received by the Bank from Recipients pursuant to any Grant Agreements (as defined below)&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's Access to Information Policy.&#13;
5.     Progress Reporting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿5.1    The Bank will provide the Donors with semi-annual reports on the progress of activities&#13;
financed by the Contributions. Within six (6) months of the End Disbursement Date (as defined&#13;
below), the Bank will furnish to the Donors a final report on the activities financed by the Trust&#13;
Fund.&#13;
5.2    Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund at any time up to&#13;
six (6) months following the End Disbursement Date. The Donor and the Bank will agree on the&#13;
scope and conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank will provide all relevant information&#13;
within the limits of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including&#13;
any costs incurred by the Bank, will be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or&#13;
evaluation will not constitute a financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.     Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank&#13;
by&#13;
May 31, 2019 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank will only disburse funds deposited in the&#13;
Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration Arrangement (other than returns to Donors) after&#13;
such date to the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to the&#13;
Administration Arrangements of all the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank&#13;
will return any remaining balance of the Trust Fund to each Donor in the Holding Currency in the&#13;
manner specified in its respective Administration Arrangement on a pro rata basis with regard to the&#13;
total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by such Donor relative to the total funds deposited in the&#13;
Trust Fund by all Donors, all calculated as Holding Currency amounts.&#13;
6.2    Any Donor may cancel all or part of such Donor's pro rata share, and the Bank may cancel&#13;
all or any Donors' pro rata shares, upon three (3) months' prior written notice, of any Contributions&#13;
(paid and not yet paid) that are not committed pursuant to any agreements entered into between the&#13;
Bank and any consultants and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration&#13;
Arrangement, including any Grant Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a&#13;
cancellation, the Bank will return to the relevant Donor or Donors in the Holding Currency in the&#13;
manner specified by each such Donor in its respective Administration Arrangement the pro rata&#13;
share(s) of any such uncommitted balance of the Trust Fund, in accordance with any additional&#13;
terms that may be agreed between the Bank and each such Donor.&#13;
7.     Disclosure; Dispute Resolution&#13;
7.1    The Bank will disclose the Administration Arrangements and related information on this&#13;
Trust Fund in accordance with the Bank's Policy on Access to Information. By entering into&#13;
Administration Arrangements, the Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective&#13;
Administration Arrangements and such related information.&#13;
7.2    The Donors and the Bank will use their best efforts to amicably settle any dispute,&#13;
controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to the Administration Arrangements.&#13;
8.     Grants to Recipients&#13;
8.1    The Bank will, as administrator of the Trust Fund on behalf of the Donors, enter into one or&#13;
more grant agreements (the "Grant Agreements") with recipients (the "Recipients") consistent with&#13;
the purposes of this Administration Arrangement and on the terms and conditions set forth in the&#13;
Grant Agreements. Grant Agreements may be entered into up to the maximum amount of the&#13;
Contributions that all Donors have agreed to make available under the Administration Arrangements&#13;
between the Bank and the Donors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿8.2    The Bank will be responsible for the supervision of the activities financed under any Grant&#13;
Agreements. Subject to the consent of any relevant Recipients, representatives of the Donors may&#13;
be invited by the Bank to participate in Bank supervision missions related to the Trust Fund.&#13;
8.3    The Bank will promptly inform the Donors of any significant modification to the terms of&#13;
any Grant Agreements and of any contractual remedies that are exercised by the Bank under any&#13;
Grant Agreements. To the extent practicable, the Bank will afford the Donors the opportunity to&#13;
exchange views before effecting any such modification or exercising any such remedy.&#13;
