       Africa Social Safety Net and Social Protection Assessment Series&#13;
&#13;
Until recently, most countries in Africa implemented safety nets and social protection programs only on an&#13;
ad hoc basis. In the wake of the global economic, food and fuel price crises starting in 2008, however,&#13;
policymakers in Africa began to increasingly view safety nets as core instruments for reducing poverty,&#13;
addressing inequality, and helping poor and vulnerable households to manage risk more effectively.&#13;
During FY2009-2013, to support governments in their quest to understand better how to improve the&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of safety nets in their countries, the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Africa Region undertook&#13;
social safety net or social protection assessments in a number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. By 2014&#13;
assessments have been completed or are under preparation for over 25 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
These assessments analyze the status of social protection programs and safety nets, their strengths and&#13;
weaknesses and identify areas for improvement, all with the aim of helping governments and donors to&#13;
strengthen African safety net systems and social protection programs to protect and promote poor and&#13;
vulnerable people. They were all carried-out with the explicit aim of informing governmentsâ&#128;&#153; social&#13;
protection policies and programs. With the results of analytical work like these assessments and other&#13;
types of support, safety nets and social protection programs are rapidly changing across Africa. For a&#13;
cross-country regional review, please see "Reducing Poverty and Investing in People: The New Role of&#13;
Safety Nets in Africa," which pulls together the findings and lessons learned from these assessments and&#13;
other recent studies of safety net programs in Africa.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          Abstract&#13;
&#13;
This report lays the groundwork for a safety net system that can address the needs of the&#13;
poor in Cameroon. Cameroon does not have a coordinated system of safety nets; rather,&#13;
small, isolated interventions which together do not address the needs. Moreover, food and&#13;
fuel price subsidies which mainly benefit the rich cost around 2 percent of GDP/year - much&#13;
more than total safety net spending. There is a need for a social protection strategy and an&#13;
effective safety net system to address chronic poverty and food insecurity in Cameroon. This&#13;
strategy should identify risks and vulnerabilities so they can be addressed by appropriate&#13;
programs. Investments in human capital and in geographic areas most affected by poverty -&#13;
the North and Far North â&#128;&#147; should be priority.&#13;

This synthesis report was prepared by a team consisting of Kaleb Tamiru (Consultant) and&#13;
Carlo del Ninno (AFTSP, Task Team Leader) in close collaboration with the government&#13;
counterpart team at the ComitÃ© Technique de Suivi (CTS) of the MinistÃ¨re de lâ&#128;&#153;Economie, de&#13;
la Planification, et de lâ&#128;&#153;AmÃ©nagement du Territoire of Cameroon. The CTS is led by Mr. Jean&#13;
Tchoffo (President), and is composed of Mr. Gregoire Mebada (Permanent Secretary), Mr.&#13;
Michelin Njoh (Research Officer), Alphonse Nigour (Research Officer), and Mme Claudine&#13;
Bahiya (Research Officer).&#13;
&#13;
Valuable guidance and suggestions were provided by: Yasser El-Gammal (Lead Social&#13;
Protection Specialist, AFTSP), Setareh Razmara (Lead Social Protection Specialist, AFTSP),&#13;
Lynne Sherburne-Benz (Sector Manager, AFTSP), Maureen Lewis (Advisor, AFTHD), Mary&#13;
Kathryn Hollifield (Country Coordinator, AFCCM), and Kalanidhi Subbarao (Consultant,&#13;
SASHD). Peer reviewers for the synthesis report were Phillippe George Leite (Economist,&#13;
HDNSP), Andrea Vermehren (Senior Social Protection Specialist, SASHD), and Andrew&#13;
Dabalen (Senior Economist, AFTP3). The team received strong support in Cameroon from&#13;
Faustin-Ange Koyasse (Senior Economist, AFTP3), Gaston Sorgho (HD Coordinator, AFTHE),&#13;
Raju Sing (Lead Economist, AFTP3), and Dan Murphy (Senior Country Officer, AFCCM).&#13;
Administrative support was provided by Natalie Tchoumba Bitnga (Team Assistant, AFCC1)&#13;
in Cameroon, and NadÃ¨ge Nouviale (Program Assistant, AFTSP) as well as Ana Makiesse&#13;
Lukau (Program Assistant, AFTSP) in Washington, D.C.&#13;
&#13;
The report draws from five background papers that review analysis of the evolution of&#13;
poverty and studies of existing social safety nets programs. These background reports were&#13;
prepared by Andrea Borgarello (Consultant), Ngueste Tegoum Pierre (Consultant), Ã&#137;tienne&#13;
Modeste Assiga Ateba (Consultant), Zamo Akono Christian (Consultant), Nkama Arsene&#13;
(Consultant), and Nkou Jean Pascal (Consultant). The team was supported by Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
National Statistical Institute during the preparation of the background papers.&#13;
&#13;
To prepare this report, the team worked closely with its government counterparts and other&#13;
development partners (particularly the AfDB, the UNDP, UNICEF, and the WFP). Preliminary&#13;
results from the background reports were discussed in a stakeholder workshop in October&#13;
2010 in YaoundÃ©. Subsequently, preliminary results of the synthesis report as well as a draft&#13;
action plan were discussed in YaoundÃ© in March 2011 at a participatory workshop attended&#13;
by government officials, development partners, and NGOs. The action plan proposed in this&#13;
report takes into account comments and suggestions received from the government and&#13;
other participants at the workshop.&#13;

&amp;#12;The World Bank Rapid Social Response Program (RSR) was the main source of funds for this&#13;
study. The RSR Program is the result of a concerted effort by several donors seeking to&#13;
support developing countries in implementing efficient social protection systems so as to&#13;
better protect poor and vulnerable people against serious shocks such as food, energy, and&#13;
financial crises. The RSR Program operates through the generous support of the Russian&#13;
Federation, Norway, the United Kingdom, and Australia and is currently supporting 83&#13;
activities throughout the world. The activities undertaken for this report have also&#13;
benefitted from the support of the Japan Social Development Fund Emergency Window. The&#13;
authors of the present report acknowledge and thank the Russian Federation, Norway, the&#13;
United Kingdom, and Australia for their financial support.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
    A.   Motivation and Objectives&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.       This report has been prepared in response to the Government of Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
strong interest in strengthening its social safety net system to support the poorest and&#13;
most vulnerable households during crises. It is grounded in extensive discussions with its&#13;
government counterparts in a collaborative and inclusive process. The report incorporates&#13;
detailed comments received from the government as well as from important donors and&#13;
partners who attended two participatory stakeholder workshops. In addition, it is a part of&#13;
the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Rapid Social Response program1 to support the Government of Cameroon&#13;
in making its system of safety nets more comprehensive, flexible, and suitable for the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic and social conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.       In this context, the objective of this report is to lay the groundwork for a social&#13;
safety net system that can address the needs of the poor in Cameroon. The high level of&#13;
chronic poverty and high levels of malnutrition (especially in the northern regions of the&#13;
country) call for a targeted social safety net program. Therefore, the objective of this report&#13;
is to: (i) assess the evolution and extent of poverty levels; (ii) provide a detailed, updated&#13;
inventory of existing social safety net programs; (iii) identify their shortcomings; and (iv)&#13;
propose suggestions, based on international experience, for increasing the coverage,&#13;
efficiency, relevance, and financial sustainability of the most relevant programs to establish&#13;
a basis for a coherent safety net system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
 The Rapid Social Response Program is part of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s response to the food, fuel, and financial&#13;
crises. Its mission is to help the worldâ&#128;&#153;s poorest countries to become better prepared to cope with systemic&#13;
and unpredictable shocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     viii&#13;
&amp;#12;3.        Cameroon has a high level of chronic poverty, and its social indicators remain very&#13;
low. It is ranked very low (131 out of 179 countries in 2010) on the Human Development&#13;
Index that is operated by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Approximately&#13;
39.9 percent of its population of 17.9 million lives below the monetary poverty line. In the&#13;
North and extreme North regions where the poverty rate is highest, almost two out of three&#13;
people are poor. Overall, the chronic poverty rate in the country is 26 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.        With a population growth rate of 2.7 percent (which is higher than the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
average economic growth rates), demographic pressure contributes to aggravate poverty.&#13;
Unless the economic growth rate accelerates significantly and the government adopts the&#13;
necessary income redistribution programs that favor the poorest parts of the country, there&#13;
is a risk that Cameroon will not reach the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.&#13;
Furthermore, Cameroon is highly vulnerable to a variety of shocks (environmental,&#13;
economic, and social) and has recently been hit by the rises in the prices of basic food&#13;
commodities and fuel and in the general cost of living following the current global financial&#13;
crisis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  B.      Poverty and Vulnerability&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.        Cameroon suffers from high levels of food insecurity. Results from vulnerability&#13;
analysis using WFPâ&#128;&#153;s approach to vulnerability through diversity and frequency of food&#13;
consumption indicate that 27.6 percent of households in Cameroon have low and poor&#13;
consumption of food, which translates to 3.38 million people (2.84 million in rural areas and&#13;
0.54 million in urban areas). In addition, only 37.1 percent of households enjoy food&#13;
security, while the remaining 35.7 percent of households have only limited food security.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.        Our analysis of the evolution and extent of poverty in Cameroon indicates that&#13;
monetary poverty remained stable during the period from 2001 (40.2 percent) to 2007&#13;
(39.9 percent). However, the actual number of poor people increased due to an annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               ix&#13;
&amp;#12;population growth rate of 2.7 percent. Of the total population, estimated at nearly 15.5&#13;
million people in 2001, 6.2 million were classified as poor. In 2007, the ECAM32 estimated&#13;
the population of Cameroon at nearly 17.94 million people, of whom 7.1 million were&#13;
considered poor.3 It is further estimated that among the poor, 26 percent find themselves in&#13;
chronic poverty (see paragraphs 9 and 10 below).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7.        Poverty remains primarily a rural phenomenon and disproportionately affects the&#13;
Northern and extreme Northern regions of the country. Compared to urban areas where&#13;
poverty rates have declined, overall poverty levels in rural areas have increased from 52.1&#13;
percent (2001) to 55 percent (2007). Of all individuals classified in the poorest quintiles of&#13;
income distribution, 40 percent and 17 percent respectively are found in the Northern and&#13;
extreme Northern regions. In terms of the evolution of poverty rates, these two regions&#13;
experienced the largest increases in poverty between 2001 and 2007 â&#128;&#146; 13.6 percentage&#13;
points in the extreme North and 9.6 percentage points in the Northern regions. In all rural&#13;
areas throughout the country, poverty rates increased from 52.1 percent in 2001 to 55&#13;
percent in 2007.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8.        Cameroonian households are vulnerable to a multitude of environmental,&#13;
economic, and social risks. Risks from environmental shocks have a direct impact on the&#13;
livelihoods of the 45 percent of the population that is engaged in subsistence agriculture.&#13;
Through a decline in the aggregate food supply, environmental risks also have an indirect&#13;
impact on the food security of the population in the country. In addition to the&#13;
macroeconomic risks â&#128;&#147; inflation, exchange rate fluctuation, export price volatility,&#13;
depressed export demand, declines in remittances, and foreign direct investment â&#128;&#147; that&#13;
have been prominent in recent years, Cameroon is also vulnerable to risks emanating from&#13;
the basic structure of the economy. These include an over-reliance on the production of&#13;
unprocessed primary goods, an undiversified export base, and high import dependency as&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     x&#13;
&amp;#12;well as low agricultural productivity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9.     Chronic poverty â&#128;&#147; those who are currently poor and are not capable of rising&#13;
above the poverty line in the near future and are particularly vulnerable to shocks â&#128;&#146;&#13;
account for 26 percent of the population. Transitory poverty (those who are not poor but&#13;
remain vulnerable to falling into deeper levels of poverty due to volatile consumption&#13;
levels) accounts for 9.9 percent of the population. As with overall poverty, chronic poverty&#13;
is also a rural phenomenon, with 38 percent of rural inhabitants being chronically poor.&#13;
Only 20 percent of rural inhabitants above the poverty line are deemed not to be vulnerable&#13;
to falling into chronic poverty. In terms of regional distribution, the Northern and extreme&#13;
Northern regions of Cameroon have the highest levels of poverty and vulnerability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10.    The chronic poor tend to live in larger households with several children and to be&#13;
engaged in agricultural production. According to the ECAM3 data, households in chronic&#13;
poverty have household head who have very low levels of education (48.4 percent), and&#13;
who are engaged in agricultural production (44.2 percent). Furthermore, households in&#13;
chronic poverty have larger than average number of children between the ages of 4 and 15.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.    The food and fuel price crises as well as the recent financial crisis all had a negative&#13;
impact on household welfare. Cameroon is dependent on imports to satisfy its food needs,&#13;
so the recent increase in imported cereal prices has invariably affected the welfare of poor&#13;
households and, in the absence of a safety net cushion, is likely to plunge the transitory&#13;
poor into deeper levels of poverty. Similarly, the fuel price and financial crises have had a&#13;
direct impact on the economy as a whole and on poor households specifically. Given the&#13;
high level of vulnerability in Cameroon, the current situation makes the probability of risks&#13;
being realized higher.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12.    Poverty is correlated with food insecurity as regions with high levels of chronic&#13;
poverty or that have experienced a dramatic increase in poverty levels also suffer from high&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               xi&#13;
&amp;#12;levels of food insecurity and malnutrition. Furthermore, households in regions with only&#13;
moderate levels of food insecurity could rapidly plunge into acute levels of food insecurity&#13;
in the face of even a small consumption shock.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 C.    Existing Safety Net Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13.    Our review of existing social safety net programs has indicated that they are&#13;
inadequate for tackling chronic poverty. Cameroon currently has a limited number of ad&#13;
hoc social safety net programs. Most of them are limited in scope and coverage. Each&#13;
program covers at best only 1 percent of the total population and only around two-thirds of&#13;
individuals identified as vulnerable in the targeted group. In addition, they suffer from&#13;
implementation challenges â&#128;&#147; particularly targeting inefficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
School Feeding Programs&#13;
14.    School feeding programs are primarily focused on improving the educational&#13;
attainment levels of girls in target geographic zones, but they have very limited coverage.&#13;
The Northern, extreme Northern, and the Adamaoua regions have the lowest girl-to-boy&#13;
school enrollment ratios. In addition, girlsâ&#128;&#153; primary school attainment levels are only 24.6&#13;
percent in Adamaoua and 17 percent in the extreme Northern regions. These programs are&#13;
mainly financed and implemented by the WFP and the MinistÃ¨re de lâ&#128;&#153;Education de Base&#13;
(MINEDUB). On average, only 55,366 students from 367 target schools have benefitted&#13;
from these programs annually in the last three years. This represents only 5.3 percent of all&#13;
primary school students in the three northern regions of the country identified as priority&#13;
regions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              xii&#13;
&amp;#12;Nutrition Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15.    Nutrition programs in Cameroon have largely been operated by donors and&#13;
development partners, mainly UNICEF, CARE, and Catholic Relief Services (CRS). All&#13;
nutritional programs are essentially categorically targeted to support orphans and&#13;
vulnerable children (OVCs) â&#128;&#147; in particular those infected by HIV or those who have lost their&#13;
parents to AIDS. All programs attend to the immediate needs of OVCs such as health care,&#13;
nutrition, and transport. The UNICEF program also provides direct support to households by&#13;
subsidizing the cost of accessing loans from microfinance institutions. In addition to&#13;
sponsoring the school fees of OVCs, Catholic Relief Services also provides business&#13;
development skills training for older OVCs as well as for single parents. However, it should&#13;
be noted that, relative to the scale of the orphan crisis, the coverage of these programs is&#13;
extremely limited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Public Works Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16.    The current public works programs are limited in scope and suffer from faulty&#13;
design features. There are two public works programs in Cameroon, Projet&#13;
dâ&#128;&#153;Assainissement de YaoundÃ© (PAD-Y) (cash-for-work) and WFP projects (food-for-work).&#13;
PAD-Y is primarily focused on cleaning projects in the city of YaoundÃ©, but it has covered&#13;
only 6,000 employees so far. In addition, its remuneration rate of 57,000 FCFA per month is&#13;
much higher than the salaries of employed individuals (29,000 FCFA per month), which&#13;
inevitably distorts labor market incentives and fails to attract only the poorest applicants.&#13;
This makes it more like an employment program than a temporary labor-intensive public&#13;
works program. The WFP food-for-work programs operate in the Northern and extreme&#13;
Northern regions of the country, which are characterized by chronic levels of food&#13;
insecurity, deteriorating ecological conditions, and poor road networks. The program covers&#13;
around 16,590 families in these target regions. However, the WFP should explore gradually&#13;
shifting from providing food to providing cash to beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              xiii&#13;
&amp;#12;Emergency Response Initiatives&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17.    Considerable resources are allocated to food emergency response initiatives, often&#13;
under the purview of the WFP. These programs involve building stocks of cereals in village&#13;
communities, which can be drawn on in times of distress. With a budget of US$21,593,854,&#13;
the WFPâ&#128;&#153;s country program has financed the creation of 133 cereal stocks, which is 64&#13;
percent of the total envisaged between 2007 and 2012. In addition to its country program,&#13;
the WFP also runs emergency response programs designed to meet the needs of refugees&#13;
from the Central African Republic and Chad. This additional program had a two-year budget&#13;
(2008-2010) of US$35,937,417. The total number of beneficiaries was 565,400 in 2008 and&#13;
94,457 in 2009. The refugee assistance program of the WFP, on the other hand, assisted&#13;
760,940 refugees in 2008 and 227,655 in 2009.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Universal Subsidies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18.    Universal subsidies such as import and value added tax (VAT) exemptions are&#13;
instruments used by the government to mitigate the negative effects of high food, energy,&#13;
and transport costs. Through a 5 to 20 percent reduction in import taxes as well as the&#13;
elimination of VAT, the government has subsidized the price of several food items â&#128;&#147; maize,&#13;
flour, fish, rice, and wheat â&#128;&#147; to the tune of 60 billion FCFA on average annually between&#13;
2007 and 2009 (an average of around 2.42 percent of the government budget). At the peak&#13;
of the fuel price increase in 2008, the government had spent 136 billion FCFA in energy&#13;
price subsidies. Public transport subsidies cost an annual average of 3.2 billion FCFA&#13;
between 2007 and 2009.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Direct Cash Transfers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19.    Cash transfers are not a common instrument of social assistance in Cameroon, but&#13;
there are some limited direct transfer programs that target indigent groups. In particular,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             xiv&#13;
&amp;#12;the MinistÃ¨re des Affaires Sociales (MINAS) is involved in assisting abandoned and street&#13;
children, handicapped individuals, the elderly, and vulnerable cultural minority groups in&#13;
the country. Because this type of assistance tends to be ad hoc, it is not well organized, and&#13;
it is difficult to ascertain the number of individuals that these programs cover. In addition,&#13;
no systematic evaluations have been done of the programsâ&#128;&#153; effectiveness. However,&#13;
information gathered from multiple sources indicates that they have an average annual&#13;
budget of around 50 million FCFA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Fee Waivers for Basic Services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20.    Some fee waivers exist in the education and health sectors, but their coverage is&#13;
quite limited. The MinistÃ¨re de la SantÃ© Publique (MINSANTE) manages fee waiver&#13;
programs for the indigent and the needy, in particular for emergency hospital treatment&#13;
and medical evacuation. Nonetheless, this fee waiver often does not cover the entire cost of&#13;
treatment. While the MinistÃ¨re de lâ&#128;&#153;Education de Base (MINEDUB) provides fee waivers to&#13;
disadvantaged primary school students, the MinistÃ¨re des Enseignement SupÃ©rieur&#13;
(MINESUP) provides needy students with fee waivers for higher education. In 2009, the&#13;
latter program had a budget of 4,800 million FCFA covering priority educational zones in the&#13;
northern and western regions of the country. During the same year, fee waivers for higher&#13;
education covered about 60,000 mostly handicapped students.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 D.    Analysis of Current Expenditures on Safety Nets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21.    Our analysis of available sources indicates that expenditure on social safety nets is&#13;
limited. Social sector spending is dominated by expenditures on health and education.&#13;
Between 2008 and 2010, spending on social safety net interventions averaged around 7.4&#13;
percent of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s budget and 1.63 percent of GDP. However, if price subsidies&#13;
are excluded, this figure was around 1.1 percent of governmentâ&#128;&#153;s budget, which translates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               xv&#13;
&amp;#12;into 0.23 percent of GDP compared with an average expenditure of 1.9 percent in other&#13;
developing countries. While the price subsidies provided by the government consume&#13;
around 6 percent of the budget, they are not well targeted. This suggests that the current&#13;
range of social safety nets is inadequate for satisfying the needs of the poorest segments of&#13;
the population. This is all the more so given that close to 80 percent of the total investment&#13;
in social safety nets (excluding price subsidies) is allocated to ad hoc emergency response&#13;
initiatives rather than to well-designed and efficiently targeted programs that sustainably&#13;
address chronic poverty and food insecurity. In general, spending on safety nets varies&#13;
between 1 and 2 percent of GDP in most developing countries.4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22.     Food and fuel price subsidy programs are the most costly, yet they are regressive.&#13;
The fiscal burden of all subsidy programs averaged 6.28 percent of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
budget and 1.39 percent of GDP between 2008 and 2010.5 Furthermore, it should be noted&#13;
that for any spike in subsidy spending, as in 2008, there has been a corresponding decline in&#13;
social sector spending, especially in the education and health sectors. Yet subsidy spending&#13;
is mostly regressive as most of the subsidized items are not in the consumption basket of&#13;
those in the bottom quintile of the income distribution. Only price subsidies on kerosene&#13;
are pro-poor. To illustrate, the richest quintile spends almost five times what those in the&#13;
poorest quintile spend on the consumption of fish, yet this item continues to be subsidized.&#13;
Similarly, the subsidies for gasoline, gasoil (diesel fuel), and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)&#13;
are regressive as those in the richer quintile spend a greater share of their income on these&#13;
commodities than those in the poorest quintile.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4&#13;
 Grosh et al (2008).&#13;
5&#13;
 Between 2008 and 2010, food and fuel price subsidies had a combined average cost of 152 billion FCFA,&#13;
equal to 6.15 percent of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s budget or 1.36 percent of GDP.&#13;

 E.      Alternative Scenarios for Expanding Social Safety Net Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
23.       A simple simulation exercise indicates that current spending levels would be&#13;
sufficient for covering different vulnerable population groups. If the current average safety&#13;
net spending were uniformly distributed and perfectly targeted to a reference group of&#13;
poor people, it would be possible to transfer a modest amount of money to each individual&#13;
to make a reasonable difference in their consumption levels. This is particularly the case&#13;
given the poverty gap of 12.3 percent or 33,142 FCFA per poor person. However,&#13;
administrative costs often account for a large percentage of the allocated budget (10 to 20&#13;
percent is the norm in direct transfer programs) and in reality uniform distribution and&#13;
perfect targeting are unachievable. Thus, the cost of transfers would have to include an&#13;
additional cost of approximately 10 percent to take into account targeting inefficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
24.       Alternative scenarios of direct cash transfer expenditure indicate that safety net&#13;
interventions are possible within the current safety nets budget envelope. If 1,000 FCFA&#13;
per person were to be distributed monthly, all individuals under the monetary poverty line&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  xvii&#13;
&amp;#12;could be covered with 86 billion FCFA annually. If we were to concentrate only on the&#13;
chronically poor (approximately 26 percent of the population), the budget requirement&#13;
would be just 56 billion FCFA annually, whereas the annual budgetary requirement to cover&#13;
all vulnerable populations (the chronically poor and other vulnerable groups) would not&#13;
exceed 120 billion FCFA. A monthly transfer of 1,000 FCFA per chronically poor individual is&#13;
equivalent to only 0.5 percent of GDP (as of 2010), a figure that is much lower than the&#13;
current average expenditure on safety nets, including price subsidies. Therefore, after&#13;
accounting for administrative costs, it is feasible to cover all of the individuals living in&#13;
chronic poverty without significantly increasing the annual budget. Even adding this cost to&#13;
the current level of total spending between 2008 and 2010, total expenditure will not&#13;
exceed 2 percent of GDP with price subsidies included.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25.     However, completely eliminating universal subsidies might be politically difficult in&#13;
the immediate future. This could lead to social unrest as the resulting price increases would&#13;
invariably negatively affect low-income groups. Also, social instability could lead to political&#13;
instability. Therefore, policymakers will need to strike the right balance and develop a well-&#13;
planned strategy coupled with an effective information campaign. One possibility would be&#13;
for the government to set up targeted cash transfer programs for the poorest income&#13;
groups while gradually reducing subsidy amounts over a set period of time (see figure&#13;
below).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  F.   Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26.     Cameroon does not have a coordinated system of social safety net programs based&#13;
on a national social protection policy, but only some isolated and ad hoc interventions.&#13;
Because individual programs are small and poorly coordinated, each has an average&#13;
coverage level of 1 percent of the population, with all the programs combined (exclusive of&#13;
price subsidies) covering no more than 6 percent of the population. It is crucial that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               xviii&#13;
&amp;#12;government with the support of its donor partners address chronic poverty and&#13;
vulnerability in order to significantly reduce their level. This should be considered a strategic&#13;
priority anchored in a national social protection strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27.       In the current spending configuration, resources are not used efficiently to meet&#13;
the needs of vulnerable people. Food and fuel price subsidies cost the government 213&#13;
billion FCFA in 2008 alone, which is much higher than the total average annual expenditure&#13;
on social safety nets (excluding subsidies). Yet the better-off segments of the population&#13;
capture the majority of the subsidies. In the other safety net programs, geographic&#13;
targeting and self-selection are used but reach no more than two-thirds of the intended&#13;
beneficiaries. Due to the low coverage and poor coordination of individual programs, each&#13;
program only reaches about 1 percent of the population, and together the programs cover&#13;
only 6 percent of the population (excluding price subsidies).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
28.       There is a need for a coherent social protection strategy and an effective safety&#13;
nets system to address chronic poverty and food insecurity in Cameroon. This strategy&#13;
should identify risks and vulnerabilities and map them to appropriate and necessary&#13;
programs. Priorities need to be given to investments in human capital as well as to those&#13;
geographic areas most adversely affected by (chronic) poverty, in other words, the&#13;
Northern and extreme Northern regions of the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 G.       Policy Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
29.       In this report we make three key policy recommendations as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      ï&#130;·   Develop a coherent safety net strategy and set of programs to address the chronic&#13;
          nature of poverty as well as food insecurity in Cameroon. Given the poor targeting&#13;
          performance of current safety net interventions, reallocating funds â&#128;&#147; in particular,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                xix&#13;
&amp;#12;    reducing spending on subsidies and increasing spending on targeted programs â&#128;&#147; is&#13;
    likely to make a meaningful difference in terms of reducing poverty and&#13;
    vulnerability. This approach will not only make safety net interventions affordable,&#13;
    but it will also enable them to respond to emergencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   Introduce new safety net programs and move towards a well-coordinated safety&#13;
    net system that efficiently targets resources to the poorest and most vulnerable. A&#13;
    direct cash transfer program that transfers a set amount of money to vulnerable&#13;
    households throughout the year could significantly reduce their vulnerability to&#13;
    chronic food insecurity. In addition, alternative forms of safety net interventions&#13;
    aimed at helping households to mitigate shocks could help them to respond to&#13;
    climate-related shocks and other seasonal income shortfalls. Integrating other forms&#13;
    of safety net programs such as labor-intensive public works together with cash&#13;
    transfers could increase targeting effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               Key Steps in the Political Economy of Safety Net Reform&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          xx&#13;
&amp;#12;      ï&#130;·   Move away from universal subsidy programs to targeted safety net programs in a&#13;
          few years time. An effective safety net system that covers the majority of target&#13;
          beneficiaries requires extensive financial resources. Since the countryâ&#128;&#153;s revenue&#13;
          sources are unlikely to create substantially more fiscal space, it seems more realistic&#13;
          to reallocate expenditures from less efficient programs. However, policymakers&#13;
          should consider the political economy ramifications when timing the reform of&#13;
          universal subsidies. .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  H.      Implementation Strategies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
30.       Four main policy objectives need to be addressed in the short and medium terms&#13;
to establish an effective social protection system. Based on the action plan that the Bank&#13;
team discussed with the government (see the policy matrix below), the four main policy&#13;
objectives are: (1) strengthening the strategic and institutional framework for designing,&#13;
implementing, and managing safety net programs; (2) reducing poverty by supporting the&#13;
consumption of the poor and vulnerable and by increasing their access to basic social&#13;
services through an efficient safety net system; (3) strengthening the financial framework&#13;
for a national social protection system; and (4) establishing a system of monitoring and&#13;
evaluation for social protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.        Strengthening the strategic and institutional framework for designing,&#13;
implementing, and managing safety net programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(a)       Building an effective safety net system requires a strong institutional framework&#13;
that provides policy guidance and coordination. Because social protection covers issues&#13;
relevant to a multitude of institutions, a cross-ministerial committee for safety nets should&#13;
be introduced to guide policy formulation and play an effective coordination role with other&#13;
poverty reduction programs â&#128;&#147; notably labor market programs, pensions, health insurance,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                xxi&#13;
&amp;#12;policies to ensure macroeconomic stability, rural development, and human capital&#13;
formation. A sub-committee responsible for safety nets should also be set up in order to&#13;
define the type, role, and instruments suitable for addressing the needs of the poor and&#13;
vulnerable population groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(b)      Institutions implementing social protection and safety net programs should be&#13;
identified and strengthened. Defining which institution will manage the design,&#13;
implementation, and ongoing operation of a social transfer program is a crucial first step&#13;
after the program has been adopted. Finally, for successful program design and&#13;
implementation, capacity building is essential. This may include on-the-job training as well&#13;
as participation in international seminars and study tours in similar countries that are in the&#13;
advanced stages of implementing safety nets and other social protection interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.       Reducing poverty by supporting the consumption of the poor and vulnerable and&#13;
by increasing their access to basic social services through an efficient social safety net&#13;
system&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(a)      Design an effective safety net system to address chronic poverty and food&#13;
insecurity. Policymakers should begin this process by identifying priority groups that could&#13;
benefit from safety net programs. Appropriate targeting mechanisms also need to be&#13;
developed to ensure that those most in need receive the benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(b)      Increase the efficiency of selected safety net programs by conducting an in-depth&#13;
critical review of these programs to learn lessons to inform any necessary adjustments. This&#13;
review should primarily focus on increasing the coverage of the poor and targeting&#13;
efficiency of universal programs as well as of food and nutrition programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(c)      Launch new programs â&#128;&#147; direct cash transfers and public works programs â&#128;&#147; that&#13;
meet the needs of the chronically poor and food-insecure. Feasibility studies â&#128;&#147; which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              xxii&#13;
&amp;#12;should establish the objectives and overall scope of the programs â&#128;&#147; will need to be&#13;
conducted to pilot and expand effective direct transfer and public works programs. The&#13;
overall objective of cash transfer and public works programs in Cameroon should be to&#13;
target chronically poor households, taking into account how much institutional capacity&#13;
exists to administer the programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.     Strengthening the financial framework for a national social protection system&#13;
(a)    Set up a sustainable financial framework for financing social protection and safety&#13;
net programs. Policymakers should start by determining the budget envelope needed to&#13;
fund a comprehensive safety net system and then identifying sources of sustainable&#13;
financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.     Establishing a system of monitoring and evaluation for social protection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(a)    Design and set in place a robust monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system for&#13;
safety nets to enable policymakers and program managers to make informed decisions.&#13;
The specific objectives of an M&amp;E system are to: (i) inform the implementation of the&#13;
program and any necessary adjustments in a timely manner; (ii) demonstrate program&#13;
impact to policymakers, development partners, and the general public; and (iii) learn&#13;
lessons to add to the global safety net experience. The evaluation function is particularly&#13;
critical for evidence-based policy development.&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This introductory chapter presents the background and rationale for this study, clarifies the&#13;
definition of â&#128;&#156;social safety netsâ&#128;&#157; that has been used in this report, and describes the&#13;
methodology of the study as well as the structure of this report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    A.   Background and Rationale&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.       This report was prepared in response to the Government of Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s strong&#13;
interest in strengthening its social safety net system to support the poorest and most&#13;
vulnerable households during crises. It is grounded in extensive discussions that the Bank&#13;
team had with its government counterparts in a collaborative and inclusive process. The&#13;
report incorporates detailed comments received from the government as well as important&#13;
donors and partners through two participatory stakeholder workshops. In addition, it is part&#13;
of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Rapid Social Response program6 to support the Government of&#13;
Cameroon in making its system of safety nets more comprehensive, flexible, and suitable&#13;
for the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic and social conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.       Cameroon is a poor country with critically high levels of food insecurity. The results&#13;
of our vulnerability analysis using the WFPâ&#128;&#153;s approach to vulnerability, which takes into&#13;
account the diversity and frequency of food consumption, indicate that 27.6 percent of&#13;
households have poor consumption of food, which translates into 3.38 million people (2.84&#13;
million in rural areas and 0.54 million in urban areas). In addition, only 37.1 percent of&#13;
households enjoy food security while the remaining 35.7 percent of households have only&#13;
limited food security.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6&#13;
 The Rapid Social Response Program is part of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s response to th e food, fuel, and financial&#13;
crises. Its mission is to help the worldâ&#128;&#153;s poorest countries to become better prepared to cope with systemic&#13;
and unpredictable shocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       1&#13;
&amp;#12;3.     Demographic pressure is likely to exacerbate current levels of poverty and food&#13;
insecurity. Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s current population of 17.9 million people (2009 data) is projected to&#13;
reach up to 26.5 million in 2020, of whom the majority is estimated to be young people.&#13;
Forty-five percent of the population was under 15 years of age in 2009 compared to only 3&#13;
percent of the population who were over 65 years of age.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.     According to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Cameroon ranks&#13;
very low on its Human Development Index (HDI) (131 out of 179 countries in 2010). With a&#13;
per capita income of US$2,196.9 per annum in PPP terms, life expectancy at birth is 52&#13;
years. The combined gross school enrollment rate (for both males and females) is only 52.3&#13;
percent. Between 1980 and 2010, Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s HDI increased by 0.9 percent annually from&#13;
0.354 to 0.460. The Sub-Saharan average had increased from 0.293 in 1980 to 0.389 in&#13;
2010, thus placing Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s HDI above the regional average.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.     Despite recent economic progress, Cameroon still has a relatively high level of&#13;
poverty concentrated in the northern regions of the country. Approximately 40 percent of&#13;
its population lives below the poverty line. In the North and extreme Northern regions â&#128;&#147;&#13;
where the poverty rate is the highest â&#128;&#147; almost two in three people are poor. In addition, the&#13;
extreme poverty rate is also high â&#128;&#146; 41 percent in the extreme North and 31 percent in the&#13;
North. Nearly 40 percent of individuals in the poorest quintile live in the extreme North and&#13;
17 percent in the North. Finally, it is estimated that 26 percent of the poor are in chronic&#13;
poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.     Malnutrition is a significant human development challenge in Cameroon. The WFP&#13;
estimates that 13 percent of children under the age of 5 suffer from chronic malnutrition. In&#13;
addition, it is estimated that 18 percent of children under the age of 5 are underweight and&#13;
suffer from stunting. Levels of malnutrition are more severe in the northern regions of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               3&#13;
&amp;#12;country, which are prone to unfavorable environmental and ecological conditions (such as&#13;
erratic rainfall, shortage of arable land, and degraded soil conditions).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7.       The recent food price crisis has exacerbated the vulnerability of the poorest&#13;
segments of society. The spike in food prices not only accentuated the risk that the&#13;
chronically poor would become even poorer and more vulnerable but is also likely to have&#13;
made the transitory poor more vulnerable to similar risks. It is estimated that among the&#13;
55.9 percent of the population who are vulnerable to poverty, 9.9 percent are transitory&#13;
poor with volatile levels of consumption. In addition, even though 7.7 percent of the&#13;
population is non-poor, they are extremely vulnerable to chronic poverty in the face of a&#13;
consumption shock.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8.       The fuel price and global financial crises have also made households more&#13;
vulnerable to poverty. While fuel is an essential commodity for households in and of itself,&#13;
it is also a critical input to the production of other goods and services (such as the&#13;
transportation, manufacturing, and marketing of export commodities). As such, a fuel price&#13;
spike has an automatic impact on household welfare. The financial crisis has depressed&#13;
global demand for Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s key export commodities (timber, rubber, oil, cotton, and&#13;
aluminum), causing export prices to decline. Similarly, remittances, which make up a&#13;
significant 0.8 percent of GDP, have fallen significantly as has foreign direct investment&#13;
(FDI).&#13;

9.     In this context, social safety net programs are of particular importance . The high&#13;
level of chronic poverty and unacceptable levels of malnutrition (especially in the northern&#13;
regions of the country) are a clear signal of the need for targeted social safety net&#13;
measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10.    The purpose of this report is to: (i) assess the evolution and extent of poverty levels&#13;
in Cameroon; (ii) provide a detailed, updated inventory of existing social safety net&#13;
programs; (iii) identify their shortcomings; and (iv) propose suggestions/recommendations,&#13;
based on international experience, for increasing the coverage, efficiency, relevance, and&#13;
financial sustainability of the most important programs to establish the basis for a coherent&#13;
safety net system.&#13;

&amp;#12;    B.   Macroeconomic Context&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.      The Cameroonian economy is relatively diversified, but economic growth has been&#13;
lagging behind the average growth rate for Sub-Saharan African countries. The economy is&#13;
primarily composed of the service sector (accounting for 44 percent of GDP in 2009),&#13;
agriculture and manufacturing (19 percent each), and oil and mining (7 percent). The&#13;
government had ambitious growth targets of 5.2 percent (5.5 percent in the non-oil sector)&#13;
in 2003-2006, followed by 6.8 percent (6.9 percent for the non-oil sector) in 2007-2015.&#13;
Actual average growth rates fell short in the period 2003-2006 (see Table 1). Growth picked&#13;
up somewhat in 2007-2008 but still fell short of the average targets for the period 2007-&#13;
2015.7 Poor infrastructure, an unfavorable business environment, and weak governance&#13;
hamper economic activity and make it difficult to reach the growth rates needed to reduce&#13;
poverty in a sustainable manner.&#13;

&#13;
12.     The non-oil real GDP growth rate has averaged a respectable 4.2 percent since&#13;
2000, but there have been signs of a slowdown in the second half of the decade. Growth&#13;
has been driven by the services sector and, to a lesser extent, by public works and higher&#13;
public spending, the result of policy reforms as well as positive changes in the external&#13;
environment. The growth of the non-oil sector â&#128;&#147; combined with a declining oil sector â&#128;&#147;&#13;
resulted in average per capita income growth of 1 percent in 2000-2008, a decent&#13;
performance in absolute terms but one that gives no comfort to the government of&#13;
Cameroon. Indeed, at that pace, it would take about 70 years to double per capita income,&#13;
and the government has rightly set higher targets in its current poverty reduction strategy&#13;
as well as in its new Vision 2035 and its new growth and job creation strategy (Document de&#13;
StratÃ©gie pour la Croissance et lâ&#128;&#153;Emploi or DSCE). There are further reasons for concern as&#13;
average per capita income growth in 2005-2008 was only 0.4 percent.&#13;

 13.     Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s inflation rate has been low as might have been expected from its&#13;
 membership of a monetary zone with a supranational central bank. Inflation averaged&#13;
 only 1.9 percent in 2000-2008, which has mitigated the negative impact on competitiveness&#13;
 of the appreciation of the nominal exchange rate. Occasional hikes in overall prices have&#13;
 been the result of exogenous factors such as increases in world fuel and food prices that&#13;
 have been passed on to the domestic economy. According to the most recent IMF Article IV&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     8&#13;
&amp;#12;consultation report8 of June 2011, overall inflation is projected to remain below the regional&#13;
convergence rate of 3 percent, largely due to several policy measures such as freezing retail&#13;
oil prices and initiatives to boost agricultural production. When high international oil prices&#13;
resulted in increased foreign assets and non-oil revenue, the government limited monetary&#13;
and price consequences by accumulating deposits and by significantly reducing its liabilities&#13;
to the banking system. Net credit to the government decreased by an annual average of 12&#13;
percent in the period 2005-2007. At end of 2008, government deposits in the banking&#13;
system were equivalent to 4 percent of GDP. This policy stance was particularly sound given&#13;
the unpreparedness of the public expenditure management system to handle a large&#13;
spending increase. The precautionary deposits also helped to address the consequences of&#13;
the global financial crisis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14.     Low non-oil government revenue remains a significant macroeconomic risk in the&#13;
medium term. Given the volatility and exhaustibility of oil revenue and resources, the&#13;
government has been wise to pursue policies aimed at increasing non-oil revenue and&#13;
achieving a sustainable non-oil fiscal primary balance. Unfortunately, however, the&#13;
government has failed to significantly increase non-oil revenue. Table 2 shows no evidence&#13;
of upward trends in the share of non-oil revenue over total GDP between 2000 and 2008&#13;
(the ratio with non-oil GDP leads to similar conclusions). As a result, the government has&#13;
turned to spending to achieve its non-oil primary fiscal balance targets. Non-wage recurrent&#13;
expenditures and capital spending have borne the heaviest burden of these adjustments.&#13;

15.    The external sector is not diversified and remains dominated by oil exports. Oil&#13;
exports represented 40 percent and 45 percent of total exports respectively in 2003 and in&#13;
2007. Other major export commodities are cocoa, timber, aluminum, coffee, and cotton.&#13;
However, the export base and structure have remained broadly stable because of the poor&#13;
business climate and eroding competitiveness, which have hurt manufacturing and&#13;
agricultural exports. In this context, external sector outcomes have been driven by trends in&#13;
international oil prices and recently by the impact of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor&#13;
Countries (HIPC) initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).&#13;

&#13;
16.     Recent debt reductions obtained by Cameroon in 2006 under the HIPC and MDRI&#13;
initiatives have provided additional fiscal space for poverty-targeted expenditures.&#13;
Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s public debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 51.8 percent in 2005 to 9.8 percent in&#13;
2008 (US$2.28 billion). On domestic debt, substantial repayments were also made possible&#13;
due to the use of the windfall gains from higher than expected oil prices in 2008. This has&#13;
allowed the government to increase public spending and investment in a sustainable&#13;
manner. Combined with the net oil exporter status of the country, the significant debt relief&#13;
places Cameroon in a good position to launch safety net programs to assist the vulnerable&#13;
and chronically poor.&#13;

 C.    The Definitions of Social Protection and Social Safety Nets Used in This Report&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17.    Social protection is understood as a set of measures that aim to alleviate poverty,&#13;
manage individual risks, and promote equitable and sustainable growth through&#13;
prevention, promotion, and protection. Social insurance programs such as health insurance&#13;
schemes provide security to the vulnerable by preventing and/or reducing the impact of&#13;
shocks. They not only contribute to better human capital but also encourage high risk/ high&#13;
return production choices that could directly reduce poverty. By expanding opportunities to&#13;
increase productivity and incomes, social protection programs also promote productive&#13;
activities. Among such policies are labor market regulations and active labor market&#13;
policies, which â&#128;&#147; by increasing access to good jobs â&#128;&#147; enhance the productive potential of the&#13;
economy as a whole. Finally, by ensuring adequate support for the poor and vulnerable,&#13;
safety net programs protect and build the human capital of the poor. Safety nets programs&#13;
also play a role in reducing inequalities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 12&#13;
&amp;#12;18.     There is no overall consensus on a universal definition of social safety nets, on&#13;
what they should address and on how to better tailor safety net programs to local&#13;
circumstances.9 Some players may use different terminologies â&#128;&#147; social protection, social&#13;
security, social assistance, social safety nets and social transfers â&#128;&#147; interchangeably. In&#13;
Cameroon, however, the term social protection is used to denote a set of contributory&#13;
social security initiatives, in particular health insurance, pension programs for employees of&#13;
the state, and mutual insurance programs to pool such risks as illness or unemployment.10&#13;
Assistance to the vulnerable â&#128;&#147; such as the disabled, the elderly with no income support, and&#13;
marginalized indigenous populations and tribes â&#128;&#147; is commonly understood to fall under&#13;
special social service programs rather than under well-designed social transfer programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19.     In the present report, the term â&#128;&#156;social safety netsâ&#128;&#157; refers to non -contributory&#13;
transfer programs to the poor or vulnerable.11 As defined in this report, social safety nets&#13;
aim to increase household consumption of basic commodities and essential services â&#128;&#147;&#13;
either directly or through substitution effects â&#128;&#147; and not to increase their resources per se.&#13;
Income-generating activities and other livelihood programs thus fall outside the scope of&#13;
this report. Such programs are important poverty reduction instruments but cannot ensure&#13;
a direct increase in consumption and are therefore not classified as social safety net&#13;
programs in this report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20.     Social safety nets are targeted in some concerted manner to the poor and&#13;
vulnerable, in other words, individuals living in poverty who are unable to meet their own&#13;
basic needs or are in danger of falling into poverty either because of an external shock or of&#13;
socioeconomic circumstances such as age, illness, disability, or discrimination. Safety nets&#13;
may serve one or a combination of the following groups:12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

of terminology and ideas.&#13;

&amp;#12;      ï&#130;·    Chronically poor â&#128;&#146; defined as people who lack the assets to earn sufficient income,&#13;
           even in good years.&#13;
      ï&#130;·    Transitory poor â&#128;&#146; defined as people who earn sufficient income in good years but fall&#13;
           into poverty, at least temporarily, as a result of idiosyncratic or covariate shocks&#13;
           ranging from an illness in the household to the loss of a job to drought or&#13;
           macroeconomic crisis.&#13;
      ï&#130;·    Vulnerable groups â&#128;&#146; commonly including, but not limited to, people with disabilities,&#13;
           the elderly, orphans, widows, the displaced, refugees, and asylum seekers.&#13;
      ï&#130;·    Losers in reforms â&#128;&#146; people who previously received benefits that they will no longer&#13;
           receive after a reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21.        Policies and programs intended to increase access to basic services for the entire&#13;
population (such as free primary education) thus fall outside the scope of the present&#13;
report. Transfer programs targeted to communities and associations (for example, to build&#13;
social assets in vulnerable communities) also fall outside the scope of this report since they&#13;
are not directed specifically at poor and vulnerable individuals or households. General&#13;
subsidy programs like non-targeted rice subsidies may be considered as social safety nets if&#13;
introduced with the intention of increasing the consumption of vulnerable households (for&#13;
example, low-income households affected by globally high food prices).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22.        Instruments used to increase consumption include direct transfers, subsidies, and&#13;
fee waivers. Common types of social safety net programs can be classified as follows:13:&#13;
      ï&#130;·    Programs that provide unconditional transfers either in cash or in kind:&#13;
              a.   Cash transfers (such as child benefit, family allowances, and social pensions)&#13;
                   and near-cash transfers (such as food stamps and commodity vouchers).&#13;
              b.   In-kind food transfers (such as school feeding and take-home rations) and&#13;
                   other in-kind transfers (such as school supplies).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    14&#13;
&amp;#12;         c.   General subsidies meant to benefit households, often for food, energy,&#13;
              housing, or utilities.&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Programs that provide an income:&#13;
         a.   Public works in which the poor/vulnerable work for food or cash.&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Programs that protect and enhance human capital and access to basic services:&#13;
         a.   Conditional transfers, â&#128;&#146; transfers in cash or in kind to poor/vulnerable&#13;
              households subject to their compliance with specific conditions related to&#13;
              education and/or health&#13;
         b.   Fee waivers for health and education â&#128;&#146; to increase the access of&#13;
              poor/vulnerable households to essential public services (including fee waivers&#13;
              for health care services and scholarships).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
23.    Safety net systems are usually woven out of several programs that ideally&#13;
complement each other as well as other public or social policies. They can be long-term&#13;
predictable transfers or short-term emergency transfers. However, a good safety net&#13;
system is more than a collection of well-designed and well-implemented programs. Rather,&#13;
the social protection â&#128;&#156;systemic effectâ&#128;&#157; can be more than the sum of the individual social&#13;
programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
24.    Social safety nets form a subset of social protection policies and programs along&#13;
with social insurance and social legislation (including labor laws and health and safety&#13;
standards), which ensures minimum civic standards to safeguard the interests of&#13;
individuals. Social protection is a basic human right that directly tackles poverty and food&#13;
insecurity and that contributes to economic growth and human development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25.    Social safety nets are part of a broader poverty reduction strategy. Social safety&#13;
nets interact with and work alongside social insurance; health, education and financial&#13;
services; the provision of utilities and roads; and other policies aimed at reducing poverty&#13;
and managing risk (see Figure 7). Poverty reduction requires ensuring peopleâ&#128;&#153;s access to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              15&#13;
&amp;#12;consumption and food security, health, education, rights, voice, security, dignity and decent&#13;
work. It involves a political process and requires dedicated efforts to empower the poor by&#13;
strengthening their voice and fostering democratic accountability. In recent years, the&#13;
concepts of â&#128;&#156;social protectionâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;social safety netsâ&#128;&#157; have increasingly become central&#13;
components of poverty reduction and food security strategies in developing countries.&#13;
Moreover, the recent food and fuel price crisis and the global financial crisis indicated that&#13;
those countries that already had a system of safety nets in place were able to respond&#13;
better and more quickly than those who did not have any such programs.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
26.    At the core of many debates on social safety nets is the question of their&#13;
predictability and sustainability. An increasing number of development actors now argue&#13;
that social transfers should be predictable, in other words, paid or distributed regularly and&#13;
in a predictable manner (e.g., whenever climate conditions prohibit good agricultural&#13;
production). In this situation, they would be provided not as an ad hoc last minute reaction&#13;
to a crisis but as a pre-emptive initiative to allow recipients to prepare for and protect&#13;
themselves in an effective way against unforeseeable catastrophes. In the past,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               16&#13;
&amp;#12;policymakers often viewed safety nets as simple relief transfers to help poor people to&#13;
alleviate the worst negative effects of shocks. However, they now increasingly recognize&#13;
that a social safety net is to be distinguished from individual social projects by the&#13;
integration of many activities into a predictable, institutionalized social protection system&#13;
based on a framework of vulnerability and risk, and supported by a rights-based approach.&#13;
Simple relief transfers proved to have limited long-term benefits and involved the danger of&#13;
creating dependency. Safety nets, if correctly implemented, have the potential not only to&#13;
protect but also to significantly promote the livelihoods of poor people. The analysis of&#13;
safety nets expenditures in Chapter 3 will delve into this dichotomy between emergency&#13;
response and predictable safety nets in Cameroon.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27.    Finally, the present report concentrates on publicly financed social safety nets, in&#13;
other words, those funded by a national or local government or by official international&#13;
aid. In most developing countries, there are three basic ways of providing social transfers:&#13;
(i) â&#128;&#156;formalâ&#128;&#157; mechanisms that are provided by governments and are prescribed by law; (ii)&#13;
â&#128;&#156;semi-formalâ&#128;&#157; support provided by UN agencies or NGOs; and (iii) â&#128;&#156;informalâ&#128;&#157; mechanisms&#13;
supplied by households and communities. The present report does not cover informal social&#13;
safety nets.&#13;

 D.    Structure of the Report&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
28.    This synthesis report relies on several background papers that drew on primary&#13;
and secondary sources of information. The background papers and the synthesis report are&#13;
based on analysis of existing administrative and household survey data, specifically, existing&#13;
household budget surveys for various years (2001 and 2007). In addition, the reports drew&#13;
on administrative and financial data and relevant information from various ministries, the&#13;
government budget and other development partners (such as UNICEF, the WFP, and NGOs)&#13;
to review the existing safety net programs in Cameroon.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               17&#13;
&amp;#12;29.    The report is organized as follows. This chapter presents the rationale for report by&#13;
providing a background as well as the macroeconomic context of the country. The chapter&#13;
concludes by providing a review of the definition of social safety nets used for the purposes&#13;
of this report. Chapter 2 reviews in detail the poverty profile of Cameroon and its evolution&#13;
in the past decade, including the profile of chronic versus transitory poverty. It will then&#13;
highlight household vulnerability to shocks and risks as well as the determinants/correlates&#13;
of poverty and vulnerability in Cameroon before concluding with an analysis of the likely&#13;
impact of the food price, fuel price, and financial crises on household welfare. Chapter 3&#13;
commences by investigating the level of social sector spending in Cameroon to assess the&#13;
position of social safety nets (and social protection more broadly) within the fiscal space. It&#13;
will then describe and assess existing safety net interventions over the past five years with a&#13;
particular emphasis on their level of coverage, targeting performance, and institutional set&#13;
up. The chapter concludes with an analysis of cost efficiency of the programs, particularly&#13;
universal price subsidy programs. Chapter 4 carries out a simulation exercise to assess the&#13;
financial feasibility of expanding the safety net system as well as the political and&#13;
institutional capacity requirements. Chapter 5 concludes with some recommendations, and&#13;
the Annexes contain a range of supporting analysis and good practice examples.&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAPTER II: POVERTY AND VULNERABILITY IN CAMEROON&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Policymakers need to have a full understanding of the characteristics of the population&#13;
groups that need safety net programs in order to design an effective safety net system.&#13;
Between 2001 and 2007, the poverty rate in Cameroon has remained stable at around 40&#13;
percent. However, the population growth rate of 2.7 percent has actually added an&#13;
additional 1.1 million poor people who live under the monetary poverty line of 738 FCFA&#13;
(1.64 USD). With the current poverty gap of 12.37 percent, it is unlikely that Cameroon will&#13;
achieve many of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There is, however, incredible variation in poverty rates among the different regions of&#13;
Cameroon. Poverty remains a mostly rural phenomenon, having increased from 52.1 percent&#13;
(2001) to 55 percent (2007) in most rural areas. In addition, four regions â&#128;&#146; Adamaoua, the&#13;
East, the North, and Extreme Northern regions â&#128;&#146; have experienced significant increases in&#13;
poverty rates. Of these, the Northern and Extreme North regions had the largest increases in&#13;
poverty rates â&#128;&#146; 13.6 and 9.6 percent respectively. In addition, a majority of households in the&#13;
poorest quintile of the income distribution are concentrated in these two regions â&#128;&#146; 40&#13;
percent and 17 percent respectively in the Extreme North and Northern regions of the&#13;
country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The most important risks to which Cameroonian households find themselves vulnerable are&#13;
environmental, economic, and social risks. Environmental risks include flooding, droughts,&#13;
desertification, and famine conditions, which occur repeatedly in the extreme northern&#13;
regions of Cameroon. In addition to macroeconomic risks â&#128;&#147; inflation, exchange rate&#13;
fluctuation, export price volatility, depressed export demand, and declines in remittances&#13;
and foreign direct investment â&#128;&#146; that have been prominent in recent years, Cameroon is also&#13;
vulnerable to risks emanating from the basic structure of the economy. These risks include&#13;
over-reliance on the production of unprocessed primary goods, an undiversified export base,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              19&#13;
&amp;#12;and high import dependency as well as low agricultural productivity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Chronic poverty â&#128;&#147; those who are currently poor and will be unable to rise above the poverty&#13;
line in the near future and who are particularly vulnerable to shocks â&#128;&#147; accounts for 26&#13;
percent of the population. Transitory poverty â&#128;&#147; those who are not poor but are vulnerable to&#13;
falling into deeper levels of poverty because of their volatile consumption levels â&#128;&#147; accounts&#13;
for 9.9 percent of the population. Similarly to overall poverty, chronic poverty is also a rural&#13;
phenomenon. In Cameroon, the most important correlates of chronic poverty are household&#13;
size, the gender and level of education of the household head, and labor market&#13;
characteristics. The chronic poor live in households with many children (aged between 5 and&#13;
15 years old) that depend on informal agricultural activities and are headed by someone&#13;
with a minimal education level. Finally, poverty is associated with food insecurity, which is&#13;
likely to have been exacerbated by the recent food and fuel price crises as well as the global&#13;
financial crisis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  A.    The Evolution and Extent of Poverty Levels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
30.     Our analysis of the evolution and extent of poverty indicates that the poverty rate&#13;
in Cameroon remained stable between 2001 (40.2 percent) and 2007 (39.9 percent).&#13;
However, the actual number of poor people has increased as a result of an annual&#13;
population growth rate of 2.7 percent. In 2001, out of a total population of 15.5 million, 6.2&#13;
million were classified as poor. According to ECAM3 data, in 2007out of an estimated&#13;
national population of 17.94 million people, 7.1 million lived under the monetary poverty&#13;
line of 738 FCFA (US$1.64) per day â&#128;&#147; an increase of 1.1 million poor people in only six years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               20&#13;
&amp;#12;31.     The evolution of the poverty gap14 nationally indicates that the poverty reduction&#13;
target set by the first Millennium Development Goal will not be attained. The poverty gap&#13;
declined by only approximately 7 percent between 1996 and 2007 from 19.09 percent to&#13;
12.31 percent (see Table 5 for the evolution of the poverty gap in each region of&#13;
Cameroon). With a poverty gap of 12.31 percent (corresponding to a poverty intensity of 31&#13;
percent), this would require an average expenditure of 83,500 FCFA per poor person (in&#13;
prices of YaoundÃ©) to close the poverty gap. This compares with 73,950 FCFA in 2001.&#13;
Information from the household survey datasets indicates that Cameroon could be off track&#13;
for meeting the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of net primary enrollment as well as&#13;
most of the health MDGs. Infant and child mortality rates have fallen to the levels of the&#13;
early 1990s, but remain high. The under-5 mortality rate in Cameroon is currently 142 per&#13;
1,000 live births â&#128;&#146; far higher than the 123 per 1,000 average for low-income countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14&#13;
  The poverty gap is the mean shortfall from the poverty line (counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall)&#13;
expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. This measure reflects the depth of poverty as well as its&#13;
incidence.&#13;

32.      Four regions â&#128;&#146; Adamaoua, the East, the North, and the extreme North â&#128;&#147;&#13;
experienced significant increases in poverty rates between 2001 and 2007. The Northern&#13;
and extreme Northern regions had the largest increases in poverty levels, 13.6 and 9.6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       22&#13;
&amp;#12;percent respectively. In these two regions, the extreme poverty rate is also high â&#128;&#146; 31&#13;
percent in the North and 41 percent in the extreme North. Moreover, nearly 40 percent of&#13;
individuals in the poorest quintile live in the extreme Northern region and 17 percent in the&#13;
Northern region. Similarly, the poverty rates for the Eastern region and Adamaoua have&#13;
increased respectively by 6.4 and 4.5 percentage points. Geographically, the northern&#13;
regions of Cameroon are located in the Sahelian and Sudano-Sahelian agro-ecological zones,&#13;
which are subject to drought conditions, erratic rainfall patterns, and desertification.15&#13;

significantly decreased in the following regions: South West, West, South, Coastal, and&#13;
Central areas. The most significant decline in the poverty rate was in the Western region&#13;
where it went down from 40.3 percent in 2001 to 28.9 percent in 2007.&#13;

34.       The disaggregation of poverty rates between rural and urban areas indicates an&#13;
urban bias in poverty reduction. While the incidence of poverty in urban areas decreased&#13;
from 17.9 percent (2001) to 12.2 percent (2007), in rural areas, it actually increased from&#13;
52.1 percent (2001) to 55 percent (2007). The two principal cities of Douala and YaoundÃ©&#13;
had dramatic declines in poverty rates during this period. However, this urban bias has been&#13;
increasing over time across all quintiles of income distribution. In 2007, more than half of all&#13;
poor individuals lived in rural areas whereas only 12.2 percent of the poor lived in urban&#13;
centers with at least 50,000 inhabitants. In Douala and YaoundÃ©, only one in twenty&#13;
individuals are poor whereas in other cities the proportion increases to one in five. Close to&#13;
94 percent of all individuals found in the poorest quintile live in rural areas, whereas only 2&#13;
percent live in YaoundÃ©, 2 percent live in Douala, and 6 percent live in other cities.&#13;

35.      The most important determinants/correlates of poverty in Cameroon are the size&#13;
of the household, the gender and level of education of the household head, and labor&#13;
market characteristics. Our analysis of the ECAM3 dataset has allowed us to gain some&#13;
insights into these characteristics associated with poverty:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·     Household size: Poor households have an average of six members whereas non-poor&#13;
      households have an average of three members. The average fertility rate is around five&#13;
      children per woman. Not surprisingly, households with polygamous household heads&#13;
      are the most affected by poverty due to the correlation of poverty incidence with a&#13;
      higher number of children. In fact, these are the only category of households for which&#13;
      the poverty rate has significantly increased â&#128;&#147; from 50 percent in 2001 to 60 percent in&#13;
      2007 (see Annex 2 for more details).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·     Level of education: Poverty progressively declines as the level of education of the&#13;
      household head increases. Between 2001 and 2007, there was a large increase in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;       poverty only in households where the head of the household had never been to school,&#13;
       whereas in other households poverty rates had fallen by at least 1 percentage point. In&#13;
       general, a household headed by a university graduate is six times less likely to be poor&#13;
       compared with a household whose household head has never been to school.16 Finally,&#13;
       the ECAM3 data show that the higher the level of the household headâ&#128;&#153;s education, the&#13;
       less often the household experiences food insecurity.&#13;

ï&#130;·      Gender of household head: Female-headed households do not seem to be particularly&#13;
       affected by poverty when all other conditions are held constant. Households headed by&#13;

    B.   Risks and Chronic and Transitory Poverty&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
36.      Cameroonian household are vulnerable to a multitude of environmental,&#13;
economic, and social risks. Environmental risks have a direct impact on the livelihoods of&#13;
those engaged in subsistence agriculture. Through a decline in aggregate food supply,&#13;
environmental risks also have an indirect impact on the food security of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
population. In addition to macroeconomic risks â&#128;&#147; inflation, exchange rate fluctuation,&#13;
export price volatility, depressed export demand, and declines in remittances and foreign&#13;
direct investment â&#128;&#147; that have become prominent in recent years, Cameroon is also&#13;
vulnerable to risks emanating from the basic structure of the economy. These include its&#13;
reliance on the production of unprocessed primary goods, its undiversified export base and&#13;
high import dependency as well as its low agricultural productivity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·     Environmental risks are by far the primary risks as environmental shocks have a direct&#13;
      impact on the livelihoods of the 45 percent of the population who are engaged in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                28&#13;
&amp;#12;     subsistence agriculture and an indirect impact on the whole population in terms of the&#13;
     decline in the aggregate food supply. Foremost among these risks are flooding, drought,&#13;
     and desertification and the famine that usually results from these climactic conditions,&#13;
     which occur repeatedly in the poorest regions of Cameroon â&#128;&#146; the North and extreme&#13;
     Northern parts of the country. According to a WFP study of food insecurity and&#13;
     vulnerability,17 close to 64 percent and 40 percent of households respectively in the&#13;
     North and the extreme Northern regions of Cameroon experience poor food&#13;
     consumption as a result of drought conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    Macroeconomic risks became prominent following the fuel and food price crises as well&#13;
     as the recent international financial crisis. These include inflation, exchange rate&#13;
     fluctuation, volatility in export prices, depressed export demand, deterioration of terms&#13;
     of trade, and declines in remittances and FDI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    Other economic risks are important determinants of poverty in the medium to long run.&#13;
     These important economic risks include: (i) over-reliance on the production of&#13;
     unprocessed primary goods (such as petrol, mines, wood, coffee, cacao, palm oil,&#13;
     cotton, and bananas), which are subject to price volatilities in international markets; (ii)&#13;
     the limited diversification of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s export commodities;18 and (iii) low&#13;
     agricultural productivity that leads to a high level of import dependency and makes&#13;
     Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s economy vulnerable to external price shocks. The annual growth rate of&#13;
     agricultural production is only 2.4 percent, which is below the estimated population&#13;
     growth rate of 2.7 percent. Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s cereal import dependency rate stands at 43&#13;
     percent, and its cereal vulnerability index stands at -1.26. The country depends on&#13;
     cereal imports for 29.6 percent of its cereal needs (mostly rice and wheat). In 2008&#13;
     alone, the UNâ&#128;&#153;s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimated Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s cereal&#13;
17&#13;
  WFP (2007).&#13;
18&#13;
  As agriculture â&#128;&#147; which accounts for 45 percent of national GDP â&#128;&#147; is a common means of subsistence, the&#13;
exposure of export agricultural commodities to negative price shocks increasingly makes rural areas&#13;
vulnerable to falling into poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    29&#13;
&amp;#12;       import need to be 630,000 tons.19 The most imported food items in Cameroon are rice,&#13;
       palm oil (both refined and unrefined), fish and shell fish, and milk and milk products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·      Social and cultural risks are also an important source of vulnerability in Cameroon.&#13;
       Women are particularly subject to a number of social and cultural risks such as female&#13;
       genital mutilation, early arranged marriages (including into polygamous marriages), and&#13;
       trafficking (including child trafficking). Even though the national prevalence rate of&#13;
       female genital mutilation is only 1.4 percent, it is widely practiced in the south west and&#13;
       extreme north parts of the country (especially in the departments of Manyu, Logone,&#13;
       and Chari) â&#128;&#147; often influenced by religious convictions. Early marriages are common in&#13;
       the northern parts of the country and usually end in divorce, which breaks the family&#13;
       structure. The majority of street children in Cameroon have divorced parents who&#13;
       married early in their lives. In addition, polygamous marriages often result in large&#13;
       households, leaving parents with inadequate means to feed their children which means&#13;
       that they need them to labor in the fields rather than go to school. Finally, according to&#13;
       an ILO study, 531,591 Cameroonian children have been victims of human trafficking.20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
37.        Besides high levels of chronic poverty, there is also a significant amount of&#13;
transitory poverty in Cameroon. The national average for chronic poverty is 26 percent&#13;
while that of transitory poverty is 9.9 percent. Chronic poverty refers to poor individuals&#13;
with a high probability of remaining poor in the near future who are, in addition, extremely&#13;
vulnerable to consumption shocks. Transitory poverty, on the other hand, refers to&#13;
currently poor individuals who might be able to rise above the poverty line in the near&#13;
future but who remain vulnerable to falling into deeper levels of poverty due to volatile&#13;
consumption levels induced by various shocks.&#13;

&#13;
38.       The regional distribution of chronic and transitory poverty mirrors the spatial&#13;
pattern of overall poverty rates. Chronic poverty is mainly a rural phenomenon. In 2007,&#13;
over 38 percent of individuals in rural areas were chronically poor whereas only 3.2 percent&#13;
of the urban population was chronically poor. Furthermore, among the rural population&#13;
who were above the poverty line (45 percent), only 20 percent find themselves non-&#13;
vulnerable to falling below the poverty line. Transitory poverty is also more prevalent in&#13;
rural areas (13.2 percent) than in urban areas (3.9 percent). The urban regions of Douala&#13;
and YaoundÃ© have very few transitory poor â&#128;&#146; only 2 percent and 0.8 percent respectively.&#13;

39.    Our analysis of chronic poverty confirmed the high degree of vulnerabilities faced&#13;
by those in the North and extreme Northern regions of Cameroon, where 51.8 percent and&#13;
53.7 percent of the population of those regions are chronically poor. Other regions with&#13;
levels of chronic poverty above the national average are Adamaoua (38.7 percent), the East&#13;
(37.4 percent), and the North West (26.5 percent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
40.    Among the most important characteristics of chronically poor households are the&#13;
level of education of the household head, participation in informal agricultural activities,&#13;
and household composition. Households with a male household head (29.4 percent) with&#13;
very little education (48.4 percent) constitute a larger than average share of chronically&#13;
poor households nationwide. Furthermore, those whose primary income source is informal&#13;
subsistence farming constitute a larger proportion of chronically poor households (44.2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                 32&#13;
&amp;#12;percent). Finally, chronically poor households tend to have a larger number of children aged&#13;
between 4 and 15 years old. (See Annex 3 for a detailed discussion of factors that predict&#13;
the likelihood of a household being chronically poor.)&#13;

&amp;#12;     C.   Food Insecurity and Poverty&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
41.        Poverty is associated with high levels of food insecurity, especially in rural areas.&#13;
The results of our vulnerability analysis (using the WFPâ&#128;&#153;s approach to vulnerability that&#13;
takes into account the diversity and frequency of food consumption) indicate that 27.6&#13;
percent of households have poor consumption of food, which translates into 3.38 million&#13;
people (2.84 million in rural areas versus 540,000 in urban areas). In addition, only 37.1&#13;
percent of households enjoy food security, while the remaining 35.7 percent of households&#13;
have only limited food security. This approach to vulnerability analysis is based on a food&#13;
consumption score used as a proxy for food insecurity. According to this approach,&#13;
sufficient theoretical foundation exists to add poor food consumption (measured by the&#13;
frequency and diversity of food consumption) to the current definition of food insecurity&#13;
(see Box 1 for further methodological details). According to the Comprehensive Food&#13;
Security and Vulnerability Analysis conducted by the WFP in 2007,21 the primary causes for&#13;
high vulnerability and food insecurity in the northern regions of Cameroon are poor&#13;
agricultural production, low education and income levels, and inadequate infrastructure.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
A householdâ&#128;&#153;s food consumption level is captured by a score, which is calculated based on the householdâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
daily consumption of a list of food items. According to the WFP methodology, these food items belong to eight&#13;
groups (cereals and tubers, legumes, greens (vegetables), fruits, meat and fish, milk products, sugar, and oil).&#13;
Each represents different nutritional values according to a given weight.&#13;
&#13;
The formula used to calculate the Food Consumption Score (Score de Consommation Alimentaire or SCA) is:&#13;
&#13;
Score = acerealxcereal+ alegmnsexlegmnse+ avegxveg+ afruitxfruit +ameatxmeat+ asugarxsugar+ amilkxmilk+ aoilxoil&#13;
where:&#13;
  xi = Number of days each sub-group of food item was consumed during the previous seven days&#13;
  ai = Weights attributed to group of food item.&#13;

&#13;
The scores calculated in this manner are reported on a scale with a maximum value of 112. The following&#13;
benchmarks are used to determine three levels of food security (which also takes into account the&#13;
consumption of oil and sugar):&#13;
                       SCA â&#137;¤ 28 : Poor food consumption&#13;
                  28 &lt; SCA â&#137;¤ 42 : Limited food consumption&#13;

&#13;
42.       Patterns of food consumption and expenditure show how vulnerable poor&#13;
households in poorer regions are to increases in the price of staple foods. As Figure 16&#13;
below demonstrates, maize, millet, and manioc make up a significant percentage of poor&#13;
householdsâ&#128;&#153; expenditure on food in four regions. These regions have high rates of chronic&#13;
poverty and food insecurity. In the urban areas of Douala and YaoundÃ©, rice is an important&#13;
staple food for poor households. Therefore, an increase in the price of different staple food&#13;
items would have different negative consequences for householdsâ&#128;&#153; welfare depending on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                                               37&#13;
&amp;#12;where they are located and their pattern of consumption. For example, an increase in the&#13;
price of rice would have no impact on the level of expenditure of those in the northern&#13;
regions and only a limited impact on the level of expenditure of the poor in the large urban&#13;
areas.&#13;

43.                                 Although there are wide regional variations, food insecurity is correlated with&#13;
poverty levels. Levels of food insecurity above the national average of 27.6 percent exist (as&#13;
of 2007) in the following regions: South West (44.1 percent) North West (37.7 percent);&#13;
North (34.8 percent); Adamaoua (32.9 percent); and extreme North (32.4 percent).&#13;
According to the FAO, the North and extreme Northern regions of Cameroon â&#128;&#147; where food&#13;
coverage varies widely from 25 to 80 percent â&#128;&#146; suffer from acute food insecurity and&#13;
chronic food deficits. To illustrate, a Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission (CFSAM) led&#13;
by the MinistÃ¨re de lâ&#128;&#153;Agriculture et du DÃ©veloppement Rural (MINADER) estimated that the&#13;
2009 cereal harvest in the extreme Northern and Northern regions of the Cameroon were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                            38&#13;
&amp;#12;respectively 11 percent and 21 percent below their five-year average and 9 percent and 14&#13;
percent respectively below the previous yearâ&#128;&#153;s production levels. Whereas the net regional&#13;
cereal deficit for the years 2009-2010 was estimated by the WFP as 250,000 metric tons, 70&#13;
percent of the total deficit (176,000 metric tons) was in the extreme Northern region of&#13;
Cameroon. This drastic decline in food supply in the region was inevitably interlinked with&#13;
adverse climatic shocks, which further compound the coping capacity of the poor. 22&#13;
Furthermore, according to the same WFP assessment, flooded valleys, which serve as&#13;
watering places for cattle, had dried out earlier than usual. This situation compromised&#13;
cattle breeding â&#128;&#147; an important income source for the population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
44.     Indeed, as a recent market assessment of the eastern Sahelian basin made clear,23&#13;
the regional livestock market was in crisis, limiting the coping capacity of agro-pastoralist&#13;
livelihoods in northern Cameroon. In February 2010, the prices of cattle, sheep, and goats in&#13;
the key regional livestock markets in Maiduguri in Nigeria â&#128;&#147; which influence northern&#13;
Cameroon and Chad â&#128;&#147; were respectively 25 percent, 40 percent, and 33 percent below their&#13;
February 2009 levels. In addition, the 30 percent increase in the price of wheat bran (the&#13;
main animal feed) over the same period made livestock sales as a coping mechanism less&#13;
viable than in the past.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
45.     Households in regions with moderate levels of food insecurity have the potential&#13;
to plunge rapidly into acute levels of food insecurity in the face of even a small&#13;
consumption shock. These regions include the East, West, and Central Regions of the&#13;
country. Overall food insecurity is much more severe in rural areas (33.3 percent of&#13;
households) than in urban areas (17.9 percent of households) and is more severe in poor&#13;
households (33.8 percent) than in non-poor households (25 percent). See Figure 17 below&#13;
or Annex 7 for more details.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22&#13;
   As an example, the off-season production of local sorghum (or mouskwari) was likely to have been reduced&#13;
because of a lack of surface water.&#13;

46.        Malnutrition rates are high, especially in the North and extreme Northern regions&#13;
of Cameroon. Nationally, it is estimated that 19.3 percent of children below the age of 5&#13;
suffer from hunger and food insecurity â&#128;&#147; a ratio that must be reduced to 8 percent by 2015&#13;
to meet the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of reducing extreme poverty and&#13;
hunger. Indeed, malnutrition continues to pose a significant challenge with about a third of&#13;
children in Cameroon estimated to be chronically malnourished. According to some&#13;
estimates, up to 45,000 children die of malnutrition alone annually.24&#13;

     in the North and the extreme North of Cameroon at 14.1 percent and 11.7 percent&#13;
     respectively. These figures exceed the critical thresholds that indicate alarmingly high&#13;
     levels of malnutrition. In addition, these two regions also have the highest rates of&#13;
     severe acute malnutrition at 2.9 percent and 2.8 percent respectively. (See Box 2 for the&#13;

ï&#130;·    Global chronic malnutrition (GCM), which measures stunting (height for age) among&#13;
     children under 5, is highest in the two regions of the North and extreme North. These&#13;
     rates were high in 2004 (44.4 percent in the North and 36.9 percent in the extreme&#13;
     North) and remained almost unchanged in 2006 (43.3 percent in the North and 35.7&#13;
     percent in the extreme North). These rates exceed the national average of 30.4&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    The causes for high levels of malnutrition are many and varied but are similar to those in&#13;
     many Sahel countries. According to a report from the UNâ&#128;&#153;s Integrated Regional&#13;
     Information Network (IRIN) from April 2009,26 the most critical causes are: a lack of&#13;
     basic health care; a lack of access to essential child survival services; poor infant feeding&#13;
     practices; overall food insecurity; and the geographical isolation of these regions, which&#13;
     compounds their vulnerability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·    Malnutrition rates among pregnant and lactating women (PLW) are highest in the North&#13;
     and extreme North regions, with respectively 8.1 percent and 17.2 percent of PLW with&#13;
     a body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5. These shares are much higher than the&#13;
     national average of 6.7 percent of PLW.27 This is of particular concern, especially in the&#13;
     northern regions of Cameroon, as it leads to very low birth weight (LBW) babies as&#13;
     revealed by data from the third round of UNICEFâ&#128;&#153;s Multiple Cluster (Household) Survey&#13;
     (MICS 3).28 The high proportion of LBW babies in the extreme North (16.6 percent) and&#13;
     in the North (14.3 percent) are above the national average of 10.8 percent.&#13;
     Furthermore, the LBW rate in the extreme North exceeds the 15 percent cut-off point,&#13;
     which is the internationally agreed threshold for triggering urgent population-wide&#13;
     interventions in response to humanitarian emergencies.&#13;

&#13;
Global Acute Malnutrition&#13;
&#13;
In an emergency situation, the weight and height of children aged between 6 and 59 months old are&#13;
measured, and the results are used as a proxy indicator for the general health of the entire population. The&#13;
index of weight for height, which reflects recent weight loss or gain, is the best indicator of acute malnutrition.&#13;
&#13;
Global acute malnutrition (GAM) is calculated with the Z-score defined as a weight-for-height index of less&#13;
than -2 standard deviations from the mean weight of a reference population of children of the same height&#13;
and/or having oedema.&#13;
&#13;
GAM as calculated with the median (%M) is defined as all children falling under 80 percent of the weight-for-&#13;
height median and/or having oedema compared to the median weight of children of the same height in the&#13;
reference population.&#13;
&#13;
Thresholds&#13;
&#13;
Different GAM thresholds exist that can be used to categorize emergency situations. However, a GAM value of&#13;
more than 10 percent generally signifies an emergency. Commonly used thresholds for GAM are:&#13;
     ï&#130;· Less than 5% = acceptable&#13;
     ï&#130;· 5% to 9.9% = poor&#13;
     ï&#130;· 10% to 14.9% = serious&#13;
     ï&#130;· More than 15% = critical&#13;
&#13;
Global Chronic Malnutrition&#13;
&#13;
Global chronic malnutrition (GCM) is calculated with the Z-score defined as a height-for-age index of less than&#13;
-2 standard deviations from the mean height of a reference population of children of the same age. GCM as&#13;
calculated with the median (%M) is usually defined as all children falling under 90 percent of the height-for-&#13;
age median compared to the median height of children of the same age in the reference population. Chronic&#13;
malnutrition is also referred to as stunting.&#13;
&#13;
Severe Acute Malnutrition&#13;
&#13;
Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is calculated with the Z-score defined as a weight-for-height index less than -&#13;
3 standard deviations from the mean weight of a reference population of children of the same height and/or&#13;
having oedema. SAM as calculated with the median (%M) is defined as all children falling under 70 percent of&#13;
the weight-for-height median and/or having oedema compared to the median weight of children of the same&#13;
height in the reference population.&#13;
&#13;
Severe Chronic Malnutrition&#13;

Severe chronic malnutrition (SCM) is calculated with the Z-score defined as a height-for-age index of less than&#13;
-3 standard deviations from the mean weight of a reference population of children of the same height and/or&#13;
having oedema. SCM as calculated with the median (%M) is defined as all children falling under 70 percent of&#13;
the weight-for-height median and/or having oedema compared to the median weight of children of the same&#13;

&amp;#12; D.      The Food and Fuel Price Crises and the Global Financial Crisis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
47.      The recent food and fuel price crises and the global financial crisis have&#13;
exacerbated household vulnerability to poverty. As established in the previous sections, a&#13;
significant number of households in Cameroon â&#128;&#147; especially in the Northern and extreme&#13;
Northern regions â&#128;&#147; are vulnerable to poor consumption of food and malnutrition. Higher&#13;
staple food prices accentuate these risks even further. Similarly, fuel is a critical input to&#13;
householdsâ&#128;&#153; essential economic activities. The global financial crisis of 2008 has affected&#13;
Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s key export sectors and also, as a consequence, the households that are&#13;
dependent on revenues from these industries. In the same manner, the decline in FDI and&#13;
remittances affects the revenue flow to households that dependent on these sources of&#13;
income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
48.      Food prices have risen faster than the prices of non-food commodities. Between&#13;
February 2007 and February 2008, food prices generally increased by 57.6 percent.&#13;
However, the highest increases were in the prices of cereals and milk products, which&#13;
increased by 84.9 percent and 58 percent respectively during the same period. Also, the&#13;
price of wheat doubled during the same period, reaching US$10 per bushel, while the price&#13;
of rice attained its highest level in 10 years. For meat products (such as beef, poultry, and&#13;
pork), prices have increased by up to 33.3 percent in the past three years â&#128;&#147; an average of at&#13;
least a 10 percent increase annually. In general, the evolution of food prices reflects the&#13;
inadequacy of domestic supply as well as international food price trends on imported food&#13;
items.&#13;

49.        Fuel prices have also increased dramatically. Between 2004 and 2008, the prices of&#13;
gasoline, diesel oil, and kerosene increased by 35 percent on average. While fuel is an&#13;
essential commodity for households in and of itself, it is also a critical input for the&#13;
production of other goods and services. This in turn has an automatic impact on household&#13;
welfare.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
50.        The global financial crisis and subsequent economic downturn are affecting&#13;
Cameroon in two main ways. First, declining commodity prices and depressed global&#13;
demand have resulted in lower exports and revenue for the state and, as a consequence,&#13;
slower growth. Second, less external financing was available for Cameroon from&#13;
remittances, private investors (FDI and equity financing), and possibly official development&#13;
assistance (ODA).29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
51.        The downturn in global demand has hit timber and aluminum exports hard. Falling&#13;
commodity prices are also worsening the real impact on export sectors. Oil prices in 2009&#13;
were projected to be about US$53 the barrel, down by 44 percent compared to 2008. As&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 46&#13;
&amp;#12;the prices of other commodities (cocoa, coffee, and timber) also declined, the deterioration&#13;
in the terms of trade was projected to be -28 percent in 2009 (Table 2). The adverse&#13;
demand and price shocks resulted in a severe contraction in the export sectors and in the&#13;
overall economy.30 Non-oil real GDP in 2009 was only 2.9 percent,31 down from 4.1 percent&#13;
in 2008 and below the projected rate of 3.2 percent. The adverse impact on growth may&#13;
appear modest, since the export sector accounts for only a limited share of GDP (timber is&#13;
about 2.9 percent, cash crops 1.4 percent, and the oil sector 8 percent), and forward and&#13;
backward links with the rest of the economy are limited in the case of the oil sector.&#13;
However, the fall in commodity prices might affect growth prospects in the future by&#13;
delaying investments in the oil and mining sectors. Marginal oil deposits are not profitable&#13;
at current prices, and this may slow down oil exploration. Furthermore, the profitability of&#13;
planned mining projects (bauxite, aluminum, iron ore, nickel, and cobalt) is also in question,&#13;
which may cause them to be postponed.32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
52.     The contraction of the economy is likely to result in lower revenue for the state.&#13;
The decline in oil revenue was particularly marked, from 7.6 percent of GDP in 2008 down&#13;
to 4.8 percent of GDP in 2009.33 Therefore, the principle challenge facing the government&#13;
after taking measures in March 2008 to quell riots against high food and fuel prices is&#13;
maintaining fiscal sustainability. These measures, ranging from an increase in civil service&#13;
wages, the exemption from taxes of basic commodities, and a freeze on fuel prices, were&#13;
equivalent to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2008.34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
30&#13;
   In 2009 alone, for example, over 50 percent of timber orders from Europe were cancelled, leading to a spike&#13;
in unemployment in the sector.&#13;

&amp;#12;53.    Although the financial sector in Cameroon does not appear to be vulnerable to the&#13;
global financial crisis, less financing may be forthcoming from other important sources.&#13;
Remittances, representing a not insignificant 0.8 percent of GDP, are likely to decline, while&#13;
â&#128;&#147; FDI sharply declined from 94.4 billion FCFA in 2007 to 10.4 billion FCFA in 2008 (see Figure&#13;
2 in Chapter 1). In addition, there could potentially be a drop in ODA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 E.    Summary of Key Findings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
54.    Poverty level has remained stable from 2001 to 2007, but poverty remains&#13;
primarily a rural phenomenon and disproportionately affects the Northern and extreme&#13;
Northern regions of the country. While poverty rates in urban areas have declined, 94&#13;
percent of all individuals in the poorest quintiles live in rural areas. Thirty-eight percent of&#13;
rural inhabitants are in chronic poverty, and only 20 percent of rural inhabitants who are&#13;
above the poverty line are deemed unlikely fall into chronic poverty. In terms of regional&#13;
distribution, the Northern and extreme Northern regions of Cameroon have the highest&#13;
levels of poverty and vulnerability. Of all individuals in the poorest quintiles of income&#13;
distribution, 40 percent and 17 percent respectively live in the extreme Northern and&#13;
Northern regions. In terms of the evolution of poverty rates, these two regions have&#13;
experienced the largest increases in poverty between 2001 and 2007 â&#128;&#146; 13.6 percent in the&#13;
extreme North and 9.6 percent in the North.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
55.    Poverty is correlated with food insecurity. The regions that have high levels of&#13;
chronic poverty or have experienced a dramatic increase in poverty levels also suffer from&#13;
high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
56.    The food and fuel price crises and the recent financial crisis have had a significant&#13;
negative impact on household welfare. Cameroon is dependent on imports to satisfy its&#13;
food needs so the recent increase in the price of imported cereals has invariably affected&#13;
the welfare of poor households and, in the absence of a safety net cushion, is likely to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                48&#13;
&amp;#12;plunge the transitory poor into deeper levels of poverty. Similarly, the fuel price and&#13;
financial crises have had a direct impact on the economy as a whole and on poor&#13;
households specifically. Given the high level of vulnerability in Cameroon, the current&#13;
situation increases the probability of many risks being realized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              49&#13;
&amp;#12;CHAPTER III: REVIEW OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY NETS SYSTEM&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Cameroon has a very limited number of safety net programs whose scope and level of&#13;
coverage are inadequate for addressing chronic poverty and vulnerability. The most&#13;
important of these safety net programs in the past five years can be classified into seven&#13;
major categories: (i) school feeding programs; (ii) nutrition programs; (iii) labor-intensive&#13;
public works programs; (iv) emergency response initiatives; (v) universal subsidy programs;&#13;
(vi) unconditional cash transfers; and (vii) fee waivers for basic services. Excluding the&#13;
subsidy programs, each individual program barely covers 1 percent of the total population&#13;
and only two-thirds of those identified as vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Relative to investments in education and health â&#128;&#147; which account for 96 percent of total&#13;
social sector spending â&#128;&#147; expenditure on social protection is extremely limited. The education&#13;
and health sectors combined accounted for an average of 24 percent of the government&#13;
budget between 2006 and 2010, while social protection spending was only a small fraction&#13;
of the 0.76 percent of the government budget allocated to social programs generally. When&#13;
universal price subsidies (for fuel, food, and transport costs) are included, this figure reaches&#13;
7.4 percent of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s budget. Excluding these expensive subsidies, total safety&#13;
net investments are only 0.23 percent of GDP. With price subsidies, safety net spending level&#13;
is close to 1.6 percent of GDP. However, 80 percent of the investment excluding subsidies is&#13;
allocated to ad hoc emergency response initiatives rather than to well-designed and&#13;
efficiently targeted interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In the current program mix, the universal subsidies are the most expensive but they are&#13;
highly regressive. Most of the subsidized food items and energy products are not in the&#13;
consumption baskets of households in the bottom quintile of the income distribution. In&#13;
addition, an increase in subsidy levels is usually reflected in a corresponding decline in social&#13;
sector spending, especially in health and education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               50&#13;
&amp;#12;Donors play a critical role in supporting safety net programs in Cameroon. Donor agencies&#13;
have spent an average of 0.18 percent of GDP on safety net programs over the last three&#13;
years. The most important donors are the WFP and UNICEF as well as NGOs including CARE&#13;
and Catholic Relief Services (CRS).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This chapter will start by situating social safety net spending within the overall social sector&#13;
expenditure and its evolution. Section B details the safety net programs that have existed in&#13;
the past five years and the principal actors, while Section C provides a detailed description of&#13;
each program. The design and performance of each program type is discussed, taking into&#13;
account key performance criteria such as appropriateness, adequacy (coverage, benefit&#13;
level, duration), and cost-effectiveness (efficiency and effectiveness) (Grosh et al, 2008).&#13;
Sections D, E, and F then analyze the expenditure efficiency of the most important programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 A.    Social Sector Spending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
57.    Social sector spending is heavily dominated by expenditures on education and&#13;
health with spending on social protection constituting only a very small fraction. The total&#13;
allocation for the social sectors is around one-quarter of total government budget.&#13;
Spending on education takes the lionâ&#128;&#153;s share with 70 percent of all social sector spending&#13;
and close to 18 percent of annual government expenditure between 2006 and 2010.&#13;
Expenditure on health averaged around 26 percent of overall social spending and close to 6&#13;
percent of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s budget between 2006 and 2010. Expenditure by the MinistÃ¨re&#13;
des Affaires Sociales (MINAS) and other ministries makes up the difference, constituting a&#13;
very small fraction of total social sector spending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
58.       The allocation to social protection is only a fraction of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s spending&#13;
on all social programs, which in 2010 stood around 0.76 percent of the annual&#13;
government budget (see Figure 22). However, as indicated during an ILO conference on&#13;
social protection held in Dakar in June 2008, providing a minimum level of social protection&#13;
(an old age pension, a disability pension, essential basic health care, minimum revenue for&#13;
families with children, and employment promotion) would cost Cameroon around 6 percent&#13;
of GDP in 2010 and 5 percent of GDP annually by 2030. If basic health care were excluded,&#13;
the costs would be around 3.25 percent and 2.15 percent of GDP respectively.35&#13;

     B.   Safety Net Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
59.       The most important safety net programs that have been used in Cameroon in the&#13;
past five years can be classified into seven major categories:&#13;
          1) School feeding programs aimed at providing nutritional support to students in&#13;
              targeted schools in the northern parts of the country.&#13;
35&#13;
     UNDP (2010).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                52&#13;
&amp;#12;       2) Nutrition programs (as part of health interventions) such as food distribution to&#13;
           malnourished children and pregnant women.&#13;
       3) Labor-intensive public works programs put in place in collaboration with national&#13;
           and international partners with the dual objectives of infrastructure&#13;
           development and revenue generation on a temporary basis for poor households.&#13;
       4) Emergency response initiatives such as the distribution of food reserve stocks&#13;
           and timely interventions during droughts, flooding, or an influx of refugees.&#13;
       5) Universal price subsidy programs for imported food items, energy products, and&#13;
           local transport.&#13;
       6) Unconditional cash transfer programs.&#13;
       7) Fee waivers for basic services targeted to the poorest and most vulnerable&#13;
           population groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
60.    The principal actors in social safety nets programs in Cameroon are both local and&#13;
international. While the government executes these programs through its various line&#13;
ministries and specific bureaus, donors rely on intermediary organizations and NGOs.&#13;
Within the government, the most active ministries are the MinistÃ¨re des Affaires Sociales&#13;
(MINAS), the MinistÃ¨re de lâ&#128;&#153;Education de Base (MINEDUB), and the MinistÃ¨re de la SantÃ©&#13;
Publique (MINSANTE). The latter two ministries are both primarily involved in providing&#13;
nutritional support to vulnerable groups through emergency response initiatives, school&#13;
feeding programs, and fee waiver programs for education and health. In addition, the&#13;
MinistÃ¨re de Finance supports all price subsidy programs, particularly for energy products&#13;
and transport, jointly with the relevant line ministries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
61.    Among the donors and international organizations, the WFP and UNICEF are the&#13;
most active in supporting social safety net programs in Cameroon. While the WFPâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
programmatic focus is on labor-intensive public works programs, school feeding programs,&#13;
and emergency response programs, UNICEF is involved in supporting orphans, vulnerable&#13;
children, and their families through a package of direct support (transport, food aid, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               53&#13;
&amp;#12;school materials) and through productive activities such as ensuring familiesâ&#128;&#153; access to&#13;
microfinance credit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
62.    The main NGOs involved in safety net interventions are CARE and Catholic Relief&#13;
Services (CRS), both of which target orphans and vulnerable children in similar ways as&#13;
UNICEF.&#13;

&amp;#12; C.    Description of Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
School Feeding Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
63.    School feeding programs are one of the main instruments used to link safety nets to&#13;
educational attainment objectives. They are used to remedy the nutritional deficiencies of&#13;
school children and simultaneously attract the maximum number of children to school. In&#13;
Cameroon, fresh lunches are served to children in schools for 165 days in a year, and in&#13;
addition, take-home rations (50 kilograms of cereals per trimester) are provided to all girls&#13;
attending at least elementary school. The latter program focuses on enhancing the&#13;
educational attainment of girls in priority zones.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
64.    Although school feeding programs are geographically targeted to those regions with&#13;
the lowest educational attainment (in particular of female students) and high levels of food&#13;
insecurity, their targeting efficiency is debatable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
65.    In terms of gender balance in school enrollment, the North, extreme North, and&#13;
Adamaoua regions have the lowest proportion of girls to boys in the school system â&#128;&#147; 0.58 to&#13;
1 in the North, 0.62 to 1 in the extreme North, and 0.77 to 1 in the Adamaoua region. The&#13;
educational attainment of girls is equally weak. The primary school attainment levels of girls&#13;
are 32.9 percent in Adamaoua and 44.8 percent in the extreme Northern region. Regarding&#13;
the enrollment of girls in primary school, only 17 percent in the extreme Northern region&#13;
and 25 percent in Adamaoua region of all girls of primary school age have enrolled&#13;
compared to 91 percent in the Western region of the country and 84 percent in the South&#13;
Western region. Therefore, the focus of the school feeding programs on the northern&#13;
regions of the country is justified given their dismal enrollment records. However, the&#13;
criteria used by the program to selecting the schools and students within those regions have&#13;
not been assessed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               56&#13;
&amp;#12;66.    The school feeding programs in Cameroon are co-financed by the WFP and&#13;
MINEDUB. While the WFP is charged with managing the logistics of providing the food as&#13;
well as supervising the programâ&#128;&#153;s implementation, MINEDUB handles the actual distribution&#13;
of the food to schools. In all of the regions indicated above, a total of 391.65 tons of maize&#13;
are distributed â&#128;&#146; 79.05 tons to Adamaoua, 191.1 tons to the extreme North region, and&#13;
121.5 tons to the Northern region.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
67.    In terms of coverage, on average 55,366 students (from 367 target schools in&#13;
selected regions) have been beneficiaries in the last three years. Out of these, around 7,180&#13;
girls have been beneficiaries of the take-home rations of cereals. However, coverage is&#13;
extremely limited since it only represents 5 percent of all primary school students in the&#13;
three northern regions of the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Nutrition Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
68.    The nutrition programs in Cameroon are mostly health-related interventions&#13;
categorically targeted to support orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs), in particular&#13;
those infected by HIV or have lost their parents to AIDS. In 2003 alone, 230,000&#13;
Cameroonian children were orphaned. The scale of the orphan crisis puts a big strain on&#13;
extended families and community groups alike.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              57&#13;
&amp;#12;69.        These nutritional support programs are mainly financed by international donors and&#13;
NGOs â&#128;&#147; in particular, UNICEF, CARE, and the CRS. Now in its third phase, the UNICEF&#13;
program provides direct support to family associations as well as households to facilitate&#13;
their access to micro-credit services. This is achieved by subsidizing access to microfinance&#13;
loans (for example, the cost of opening an account and meeting the required level of&#13;
savings) The average level of support is 16,190 FCFA per child or 65,515 FCFA per family. In&#13;
addition to these two services, UNICEF also subsidizes the health and educational costs of&#13;
OVCs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
70.        CARE provides two kinds of assistance. First, it helps to meet the immediate needs of&#13;
the orphans in terms of, for example, nutrition, health care costs, and transport. Second, it&#13;
also provides productive help to community groups/associations. Eligibility for the program&#13;
is conditional on passing an evaluation of the economic situation of beneficiaries&#13;
(conducted by social workers) and the health status of sick children or parents. The CRS is&#13;
active in the north west of Cameroon (the Diocese of Kummo), where the number of&#13;
orphans has dramatically increased in the past 10 years.36 The CRS program is primarily&#13;
focused on sponsoring the primary school fees of OVCs as well as providing skills training for&#13;
older OVCs and training in business development for groups of single parents.&#13;

&#13;
71.        However, relative to the scale of the orphan crisis, the coverage of those in need is&#13;
extremely limited. From 2005 to the present time, the UNICEF project has supported only&#13;
&#13;
36&#13;
     CRS (2007).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;2,614 children (585 families) in eight regions of the country (except in the North and&#13;
extreme Northern regions). The CARE program assists only around 20,000 people annually,&#13;
out of which only 3,000 are OVCs. The CRS program assists only 7,500 children countrywide&#13;
â&#128;&#146; 6,000 in the North West, 400 in the South West, 550 in the East, and 550 in Central&#13;
Cameroon.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Labor-intensive Public Works Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
72.      Labor-intensive public works programs are normally short-term safety net&#13;
interventions that provide temporary employment opportunities in public infrastructure&#13;
projects. They can be either cash-for-work or food-for-work programs. There are two&#13;
principal public works initiatives in Cameroon â&#128;&#146; Projet dâ&#128;&#153;Assainissement de YaoundÃ© (PAD-&#13;
Y), which pays cash, and the WFP project, which pays participants in food.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
73.      Projet dâ&#128;&#153;Assainissement de YaoundÃ© (PAD-Y) was launched in September 2006 for a&#13;
period of five years at a cost of 22.3 billion FCFA (approximately US$50 million). Financed&#13;
mostly by the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Government of Cameroon, it&#13;
primarily focuses on infrastructure cleaning projects in the city of YaoundÃ©.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
74.      In the case of PAD-Y, the targeting efficiency is likely to be minimal as the daily&#13;
remuneration rate of approximately 2,400 FCFA (equivalent to 57,000 FCFA monthly) is&#13;
much higher than the salaries of most employed individuals (an average of 29,000 FCFA per&#13;
month). In addition, the eligibility criterion is residence within a target zone. This distorts&#13;
labor market incentives since the high wage level is not conducive to self-targeting (which is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     59&#13;
&amp;#12;the international best practice for targeting public works programs â&#128;&#147; see Box 3) as it is an&#13;
encouragement for the non-poor as well as the poor to participate. In its current design,&#13;
therefore, the PAD-Y is more of a general employment program than a temporary labor-&#13;
intensive public works program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
75.     The WFP project is a food-for-work public works intervention in the North and&#13;
extreme Northern regions of the country. Both regions suffer from chronic levels of food&#13;
insecurity, deteriorating ecological conditions, and poor road networks. The project&#13;
primarily offers work on upgrading rural infrastructure such as roads and small-scale&#13;
irrigation structures. Participants are provided with 50 kilograms of cereals monthly, which&#13;
is equivalent to 3,147 FCFA (in 2008 market value), which is comparable to US$7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                           Box 3: Self-targeting in Public Work Programs&#13;
&#13;
 In contexts where poverty targeting appears to be particularly challenging and where financial and&#13;
 administrative capacity is limited, relying on self-targeting can be attractive. However, this will only be&#13;
 possible if the market wage is above the minimum wage. This is because the program wage legally cannot&#13;
 be lower than the minimum wage but has to be lower than the market rate for unskilled labor in order to&#13;
 attract only poor to the public works program. So if the minimum wage is equal to or above the market&#13;
 wage and restrictive employment laws prevent setting the wage below the minimum level, the possibility of&#13;
 using self-targeting is hindered and other targeting mechanisms need to be introduced. The use of pure&#13;
 self-selection might also be insufficient in reaching vulnerable groups in poor areas or when demand for&#13;
 participation is very large, whereupon some form of employment rationing would be needed. The fact that&#13;
 youths aged 15 to 24 constitute one-third of the unemployed â&#128;&#147; with young women even hit harder than&#13;
 young men â&#128;&#147; also suggests the need to target this category specifically. Setting the program wage too low&#13;
 also presents the risk of excluding those poor households that have higher opportunity costs of labor â&#128;&#147; if&#13;
 the program wage is below the reservation wage â&#128;&#147; or of failing to achieve a program objective (such as a&#13;
 nutrition objective if the program wage is far below the cost of the minimum consumption basket). It is&#13;
 crucial to ensure the program wage is set in relation to the project goals.&#13;

Emergency Response Initiatives&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
76.     Emergency response initiatives are largely designed to respond to natural disasters â&#128;&#147;&#13;
droughts, flooding, and influxes of refugees â&#128;&#147; that threaten the food security of large&#13;
number of individuals. In Cameroon, this has involved the creation of food stock reserves&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      60&#13;
&amp;#12;that can be distributed to vulnerable populations in times of distress, including refugees&#13;
from the Central African Republic and Chad.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
77.       The WFP and MINADER have been the primary actors in emergency food relief and&#13;
related nutritional programs. With a budget of US$ 21,593,854, the WFPâ&#128;&#153;s project has&#13;
financed the creation of 133 cereal stocks in village communities â&#128;&#147; 64 percent of the total&#13;
envisaged between 2007 and 2012. The funds are used to cover the cost of procuring&#13;
cereals (91 percent) and other direct and indirect costs associated with the distribution of&#13;
food. The cereals are usually purchased domestically, particularly in the north and western&#13;
regions of the country. Through lâ&#128;&#153;Office CÃ©rÃ©alier, MINADER is responsible for stockpiling&#13;
the cereals and selling them at moderate prices to vulnerable populations in times of&#13;
droughts, food crises, and emergency situations. It has intervened in the following cities in&#13;
the past: Kousseri (a structurally food deficit border city), Yagoua, Mokolo, Mora, Guider,&#13;
Maroua, and KaÃ©le. However, MINADER does not intervene in the market when cereal&#13;
supply is optimal and prices are stable as well as affordable.&#13;

78.       In addition to the aforementioned country program, the WFP also runs an&#13;
emergency response program to respond to: (i) the needs of refugees from Central African&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         61&#13;
&amp;#12;Republic and Chad and (ii) risks of malnutrition caused by drought conditions in the North&#13;
and extreme Northern regions of the country. This program started in March 2008 and&#13;
concluded in July 2010 with a budget of US$ 35,937,417. In this program, each individual&#13;
received 2,100 kcal daily in monthly food rations consisting of maize, pulses, corn-soya&#13;
blend (CSB), vegetable oil, sugar, and iodized salt. Acutely vulnerable refugees were&#13;
included in the Supplementary Feeding Program (SFP) which provided an additional 1,281&#13;
kcal per day.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
79.        Program beneficiaries were selected from the household survey data in&#13;
regions/zones suffering from major cases of food insecurity. In terms of coverage, the total&#13;
number of beneficiaries in 2008 was 565,400 and in 2009 it was 94,457.37 The WFPâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
refugee assistance program, on the other hand, assisted 760,940 refugees in 2008 and&#13;
227,655 in 2009. The refugees are mainly found in 72 sites in the east of the country and in&#13;
the Adamaoua region on the border with the Central African Republic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Universal Price Subsidies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
80.        There are three types of universal price subsidies in Cameroon: (i) price subsidies on&#13;
imported food items; (ii) price subsidies on petroleum products; and (iii) transport cost&#13;
subsidies in the cities of YaoundÃ© and Douala.&#13;

&amp;#12;81.     Every year since 2004, the country has experienced an increase in staple food prices&#13;
of around 5 percent, influenced by insufficient supply, strong external demand (especially&#13;
from the bordering countries of Gabon, Chad, and Equatorial Guinea), and limited market&#13;
access. Poor road and transport conditions/infrastructure further limit the timely supply of&#13;
food. To alleviate the impact of food price hikes, the government has reduced import and&#13;
value-added taxes. Universal price subsidies â&#128;&#147; through tax exemptions â&#128;&#147; have been the&#13;
main instruments routinely used by the government to address food insecurity in the&#13;
country. Food price subsidies cost the government a revenue loss of 60 billion FCFA&#13;
between 2007 and 2009. Table 13 summarizes the main measures taken by the government&#13;
to control the rising food prices.&#13;

82.     Subsidies for energy products are provided both directly and indirectly. The&#13;
government provides direct budgetary transfers to SONARA (the local petroleum refinery)&#13;
while it indirectly subsidizes energy products such as gasoline, diesel (fuel) oil, kerosene (for&#13;
lighting), and LPG through tax reductions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
83.     The amount of the budgetary transfer to SONARA is jointly calculated by SONARA&#13;
and the Caisse de stabilisation des prix des produits pÃ©troliers (CSPH) according to a pricing&#13;

&amp;#12;formula that has been in place since 2007 (applied to three fuel products â&#128;&#147; gasoline,&#13;
kerosene, and diesel). As Table 14 shows, the formula calculates a local wholesale price for&#13;
final products by adding to the prevailing world reference price:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       i)        International transport and insurance costs (b) to arrive at an import parity&#13;
                 price (c)&#13;
       ii)       An adjustment coefficient (e) of 15 percent of the import parity price to provide&#13;
                 compensation (de facto a producer subsidy) to SONARA&#13;
       iii)      Taxes (d) including a 10 percent customs duty and 19.25 percent VAT&#13;
       iv)       Coastal navigation costs (f).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
84.           The notional retail price is calculated by adding distribution costs and margins and a&#13;
specific tax â&#128;&#147; for gasoline and diesel only â&#128;&#147; to the wholesale price. The formula calculates&#13;
the shortfall (subsidy) per liter of final product as the difference between the notional retail&#13;
price and the fixed pump price.38&#13;

85.        These price subsidies cost the government 136 billion FCFA in 2008. In 2009, due to&#13;
the rise in oil price, which increased SONARAâ&#128;&#153;s revenues, the subsidy had declined to 22.527&#13;
billion FCFA. However, it subsequently increased to 145 billion FCFA in 2010 and is&#13;
projected to reach 240 billion FCFA in 2011.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
86.        However, as the analysis in Section D will demonstrate, it will be necessary to&#13;
narrow down the number of energy products to be subsidized in order to ensure that the&#13;
subsidies are progressive/pro-poor. The rich use disproportionately more gasoline, diesel&#13;
(fuel) oil, and LPG than the poor. On the other hand, the poorest Cameroonians spend a&#13;
larger portion of their income on the consumption of LPG than the rich. Yet the subsidies&#13;
are universally applied to all four energy products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
87.        The transport subsidies in the urban areas of Douala and YaoundÃ© are mostly used&#13;
to subsidize poor familiesâ&#128;&#153; use of mass transport. The government achieves this by&#13;
subsidizing each ticket bought through the transport companies SOCATUR (in Douala) and le&#13;
BUS (in YaoundÃ©). On a transport ticket price of 270 FCFA, the government subsidizes 120&#13;

                                                              65&#13;
&amp;#12;FCFA for eligible beneficiaries, including students lacking necessary parental support. In&#13;
terms of coverage, however, there are only around 10,000 beneficiaries daily, though the&#13;
subsidy cost the government an average of 3.2 billion FCFA between 2007 and 2009.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Unconditional Cash Transfers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
88.    Generally speaking, cash transfers are not a common mode of social assistance in&#13;
Cameroon, but there are some direct transfer programs targeting the needy and indigents.&#13;
In particular, MINAS is involved in assisting abandoned and street children, handicapped&#13;
individuals, the elderly, and vulnerable cultural minority groups. However, the involvement&#13;
of MINAS is often in the form of supporting private institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
89.    Because this type of assistance is ad hoc in nature, it is not well organized and the&#13;
number of individuals covered is not easily ascertainable. There has no systematic&#13;
evaluation of the effectiveness of these programs. However, information gathered from&#13;
multiple sources indicates that they have an average budget of around 50 million FCFA.&#13;
Fee Waiver Programs for Basic Services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
90.     Some fee waivers exist in the education and health sectors, but their coverage is&#13;
quite limited. The MinistÃ¨re de la SantÃ© Publique (MINSANTE) manages fee waiver programs&#13;
for the indigent and the needy, in particular for emergency hospital treatment and medical&#13;
evacuation. Nonetheless, this fee waiver often does not cover the entire cost of treatment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
91.    For fee waiver programs in education, the MinistÃ¨re de lâ&#128;&#153;Education de Base&#13;
(MINEDUB) and the MinistÃ¨re de lâ&#128;&#153;Enseignement SupÃ©rieur (MINESUP) run programs aimed&#13;
at guaranteeing access to education. While MINEDUB provides fee waivers to&#13;
disadvantaged primary school students, MINESUP provides fee waivers for higher education&#13;
to needy students. In 2009, this program had a budget of 4800 million FCFA covering&#13;
priority educational zones in the northern and western regions of the country. During the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              66&#13;
&amp;#12;same year, fee waivers for higher education covered about 60,000 mostly handicapped&#13;
students.&#13;

 D.      Expenditure on Safety Nets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
92.      Overall analysis from available sources indicates that expenditure on social safety&#13;
net initiatives is very limited. Between 2008 and 2010, spending on social safety nets&#13;
averaged around 4.42 percent of social program expenditure, which translates to 1.07&#13;
percent of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s budget and only 0.23 percent of GDP. Taking into account&#13;
price subsidies, however, this expenditure accounts for 7.4 percent of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
budget, which translates into 1.63 percent of GDP and 30.77 percent of spending on social&#13;
programs. While the price subsidies provided by the government consume around 6&#13;
percent of the budget, they are not well-targeted.&#13;

93.        Out of the 0.23 percent of GDP spent on social safety net, 77 percent (excluding&#13;
price subsidies) is provided by donor organizations.39 This translates, on average, into 0.18&#13;
percent of GDP over the past three years. However, including price subsidies, the&#13;
governmentâ&#128;&#153;s share is close to 89 percent of social safety net expenditures. This suggests&#13;
that price subsidies have been the most prominent social safety net instrument used by the&#13;
government. This is clear in the analysis of the evolution of spending in social sector over&#13;
the past three years compared to subsidy spending. The decline in social sector spending in&#13;
2009 is reflected in a corresponding increase in subsidy spending (see Figure 23 above).&#13;

&amp;#12;94.        When safety nets expenditures are disaggregated, it can be seen that 80 percent of&#13;
government investment is allocated to emergency responses to food insecurity induced&#13;
by droughts, flooding, and other climatic shocks. This often includes maintaining stocks of&#13;
food reserves to distribute to the population at risk of food insecurity, in particular in the&#13;
northern regions of the country and in rural areas, and, in some cases, to target the most&#13;
vulnerable population groups such as refugees. Investment in food stocks increased&#13;
significantly in 2008 in response to the food crisis of 2007, which caused intense public&#13;
protests.40 By contrast, investment in classic safety net interventions such as school feeding&#13;
and labor-intensive public works programs, on average, represented a mere 20 percent of&#13;
the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s total investment in the past three years. This barely makes up 1 percent&#13;
of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s budget allocation to social sector spending.&#13;

95.        In international comparisons, Cameroon is at the lower end of the spectrum in&#13;
terms of safety net spending levels. The average spending on safety nets in developing&#13;
countries is around 1.9 percent of GDP, and the median spending level is 1.3 percent of&#13;
GDP.41 In Cameroon, the total spending for safety nets including subsidies is equal to 1.63&#13;
percent of GDP and is comparable with the average level of expenditure in developing&#13;
countries. However, if we exclude the subsidies, Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s spending level of 0.23 percent&#13;
of GDP is one of the lowest among all African countries and below the spending level of&#13;

percent), and Tanzania (0.3 percent). In both Ethiopia and Malawi, spending levels are&#13;
around 4.5 percent of GDP. Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), largely&#13;
financed by donors, covers 7.6 million people or 10 percent of the population. In Malawi,&#13;
the largest component of the safety net system is an agricultural program that covers 2.7&#13;
million farm families (2005 data) or 5 percent of the population. Other high spending&#13;
countries such as Mauritius and South Africa, which have a much higher level of income,&#13;
finance safety nets from domestic sources.&#13;

 E.    Analysis of Social Safety Net Coverage&#13;
96.    Generally speaking, the level of coverage by all existing safety nets programs is&#13;
quite limited. Without considering the different subsidy programs, while the level of&#13;
coverage of all safety nets interventions is around 6 percent of the population, the level of&#13;
coverage of each individual program intervention hovers around 1 percent of the&#13;
population. Moreover, taking into account data on vulnerability from ECAM3 datasets, the&#13;
level of coverage by most programs (excluding price subsidies) is around two-thirds of the&#13;
potential target beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
97.     Therefore, in its current configuration, safety net spending is not well-designed to&#13;
address chronic poverty and food insecurity. The vast majority of the resources being spent&#13;
on food emergency interventions and is thus aimed at alleviating short-term and temporary&#13;
vulnerability rather than chronic poverty. Finally, although the targeting efficiency of most&#13;
of the small programs has not been systematically assessed, the more relevant point as&#13;
detailed above is that they are too small in scope to make any meaningful difference to&#13;
poverty levels.&#13;

&amp;#12; F.    Efficiency of Universal Price Subsidies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
98.    A large share of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s response to the spike in the prices of staple&#13;
foods and energy products has been in the form of universal price subsidies. The fiscal&#13;
burden of all subsidies combined averaged around 6.28 percent of government budget and&#13;
close to 1.39 percent of GDP between 2008 and 2010. In addition, it should be noted that&#13;
half of this amount went to subsidize energy products, which only minimally assisted the&#13;
most vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Food Price Subsidies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
99.    The food price subsidies, which cost 60 billion FCFA between 2007 and 2009, are&#13;
not efficiently targeted because they do not reflect the consumption baskets of the&#13;
poorest households. The government provides price subsidies for maize, fish, rice, and&#13;
wheat as these are the major food items consumed by the population. However, only the&#13;
maize price subsidy is pro-poor since those in the bottom quintile of the income distribution&#13;
(20 percent of the population) spend a larger proportion (5.2 percent) of their total food&#13;
expenditure on maize than households in the other four quintiles. Those in the richest&#13;
quintile spend about 1.2 percent of their total consumption on maize, which indicates that,&#13;
in absolute terms, people in the poorest quintile spend close to five times more on the&#13;
consumption of maize in percentage terms. By contrast, the richest quintile spends more&#13;
than those in the poorest quintile on the consumption of fish, rice, and wheat and wheat&#13;
products, making these price subsidies particularly regressive. On the other hand, for the&#13;
other subsidized food items, not only is there minimal difference in the share of&#13;
expenditure among the upper four quintiles but also the poorest quintile does not benefit&#13;
the most from the price subsidies.&#13;

Energy Product Subsidies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
100.     The fuel price subsidy is badly targeted, and the resulting significant revenue loss&#13;
could be used in ways that better assist the poor. Energy subsidies cost the government&#13;
137 billion FCFA in 2008 and are projected to cost 240 billion FCFA in 2011â&#128;&#147; a steep increase&#13;
from the 9.8 billion FCFA that they cost in 2004. However, as Table 22 below demonstrates,&#13;
the subsidies for gasoline, gasoil (diesel fuel), and LPG are regressive as those in the richest&#13;
quintile of the income distribution spend more of their income on these commodities than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    74&#13;
&amp;#12;those in the poorest quintile. By contrast, those in the poorest quintile spend 1.67 percent&#13;
of their total expenditure to the purchase of kerosene while those in the richest quintile&#13;
spend just 0.68 percent of their total consumption expenditure on kerosene. Based on&#13;
household expenditure levels, only kerosene subsidies are targeted to the poorest&#13;
households, who spend almost three times more on its consumption than the richest&#13;
quintile. However, according to a 2007 IMF assessment,42 over 70 percent of fuel price&#13;
subsidies accrue to the richest 40 percent of households in Cameroon. The report showed&#13;
that the poorest 20 percent of households receive less than 1 percent of the gasoline&#13;
subsidy. In the case of the kerosene subsidy, which is usually assumed to be pro-poor, the&#13;
poorest 20 percent of households receive only 13 percent of the subsidy. In addition,&#13;
kerosene consumption is low compared to the consumption of gasoline and diesel.&#13;
Therefore, eliminating subsidies on gasoline and diesel only â&#128;&#147; at the baseline price of&#13;
US$100 per barrel â&#128;&#147; could free resources equivalent to 1.8 percent of GDP for alternative&#13;
uses, including mitigating the impact of fuel price increase on the poor.43&#13;

     G.    Summary of Findings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
102.       In the current configuration, the budgetary allocation to social safety net&#13;
initiatives is very small. Social sector spending is heavily dominated by expenditure on&#13;
health and education as the allocation to the social safety net programs detailed in this&#13;
chapter is actually a very small fraction of the 0.76 percent of the government budget&#13;
allocated to all social programs. This suggests that social safety nets and other social&#13;
protection measures are not regarded as central to the overall poverty reduction agenda.&#13;
This is all the more so given that close to 80 percent of the investment on social safety nets&#13;
(excluding price subsidies) is allocated to ad hoc emergency response initiatives rather than&#13;
well-designed and efficiently targeted safety net interventions that sustainably address&#13;
chronic poverty and food insecurity. Currently safety net spending accounts for only 0.23&#13;
percent of GDP (excluding the price subsidies) as opposed to the 1 to 2 percent of GDP&#13;
spent by most developing countries.44&#13;

&amp;#12;103.   Food and fuel price subsidy programs are the most costly of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
safety net programs, but they are very poorly targeted to the poorest and most&#13;
vulnerable. The fiscal burden of all subsidy programs amounted to an average of 6.28&#13;
percent of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s budget and 1.39 percent of GDP between 2008 and 2010.&#13;
Furthermore, it should be noted that, for any spike in subsidy spending, there has been a&#13;
corresponding decline in social sector spending, especially in education and health. Yet&#13;
subsidy spending is mostly regressive as most of the subsidized items are not in the&#13;
consumption basket of those in the bottom quintile of the income distribution. Only the&#13;
price subsidies on maize and kerosene are pro-poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
104.   The other safety nets interventions discussed in this report are limited in scope&#13;
and coverage. Each individual program covers at most only 1 percent of the total&#13;
population and only around two-thirds of the individuals identified as vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
105.   Several donors play a critical role in social safety net provision in Cameroon. Of the&#13;
0.23 percent of GDP spent on safety nets (excluding subsidies), 77 percent (or an average of&#13;
0.18 percent of GDP over the last three years) was provided by donors. The WFP and&#13;
UNICEF are the most important multilateral donors engaged in food emergency response,&#13;
school feeding, and nutrition programs, and the most active NGOs are CARE and Catholic&#13;
Relief Services (CRS).&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAPTER IV: FINANCIAL, INSTITUTIONAL, AND POLITICAL FEASIBILITY OF AN EXPANDED&#13;
SOCIAL SAFETY NET SYSTEM&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
By introducing well-designed and efficiently targeted direct transfer and public works&#13;
programs, it would be possible to expand Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s social safety net coverage to the&#13;
majority of the chronically poor. Our simulations show that such a scenario is possible within&#13;
the existing budget envelope. For instance, by transferring an average annual amount of&#13;
24,000 FCFA per person annually, it would be feasible to cover all chronically poor&#13;
households at a cost of only about 1 percent of GDP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This can be achieved by re-allocating some current spending on expensive universal&#13;
subsidies to safety net programs targeted to the poor and vulnerable. Once functional, these&#13;
safety net programs can provide a clear and credible alternative to otherwise expensive&#13;
universal subsidy programs. However, their implementation should be preceded by careful&#13;
feasibility studies to define their objectives, scope, and key design parameters, such as the&#13;
number of people to cover, the duration of the coverage, payment modalities, and the&#13;
seasons when they will be operational.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Reforming universal subsidies may be politically difficult given the impending presidential&#13;
(October 2011) and parliamentary (mid-2012) elections. The government is rightly cautious&#13;
about making rapid policy reforms that could negatively influence political outcomes.&#13;
However, developing appropriately timed and well-planned strategies for launching pilots&#13;
(that can provide valuable lessons for later expansion) would make it possible to enact&#13;
reforms with minimal political or social repercussions. Appropriate information campaigns&#13;
will be necessary to inform the public about these new safety net programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A multitude of government ministries is currently involved in the various aspects of social&#13;
protection provision. Because the most successful social protection systems are underpinned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              79&#13;
&amp;#12;by a strong coordinating mechanism, the government should create a social protection&#13;
committee to coordinate these various government agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  A.     Expanding the Coverage of Social Safety Net Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
106.     A simple simulation exercise indicates that the current level of spending on safety&#13;
nets would be sufficient to cover the different vulnerable population groups in Cameroon.&#13;
If the current amount of safety net spending were uniformly distributed and perfectly&#13;
targeted to a reference group of poor people, it would be possible to transfer a modest&#13;
amount of money per individual that would make a meaningful difference in their&#13;
consumption levels. This is particularly the case considering that the poverty gap is at 12.3&#13;
percent or 33,142 FCFA per poor person annually. However, administrative costs often&#13;
account for a certain percentage of the allocated budget (10 to 20 percent is the norm in&#13;
direct transfer programs) and, in reality, uniform distribution and perfect targeting are&#13;
unachievable. Table 24 below shows how much the chronically poor, other vulnerable&#13;
groups (transitory poor and non-poor vulnerable), and the population below the monetary&#13;
poverty ceiling would receive under the above assumptions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;107.    Alternative forms of safety net interventions are possible within the current safety&#13;
net budget envelope. If 1,000 FCFA per person were to be distributed monthly, all&#13;
individuals under the monetary poverty line could be covered with 86 billion FCFA annually.&#13;
If we were to target only the chronically poor, the budget requirement would be just 56&#13;
billion FCFA annually, whereas if we wanted to cover all vulnerable populations (the&#13;
chronically poor and other vulnerable groups), the annual budgetary requirement would not&#13;
exceed 120 billion FCFA. As Table 25 below illustrates, a monthly transfer of 1,000 FCFA per&#13;
chronically poor individual is equivalent to only 0.5 percent of GDP (in 2010 terms), which is&#13;
much lower than the current average expenditure on safety nets, including price subsidies.&#13;
Therefore, even after accounting for administrative costs, it would be feasible to cover all of&#13;
the individuals living in chronic poverty without significantly increasing the annual budget.&#13;
Similarly, if we were to want to provide all individuals under the monetary poverty line with&#13;
a direct monthly cash transfer equivalent to 33,142 FCFA (the poverty gap per poor person&#13;
annually), total expenditure would not exceed 2.22 percent of GDP, which was the spending&#13;
level in 2008 with price subsidies included.&#13;

&amp;#12;     B.   Possible New Programs to Introduce&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
108.      The reforms should be designed with the aim of creating an efficient system of&#13;
safety nets. In addition to being well-designed, a good system of safety net programs has&#13;
the following characteristics: (i) it is adequate to meet the needs of the various groups in&#13;
need of assistance; (ii) it is equitable but provides more resources to the poorest (horizontal&#13;
versus vertical equity);45 (iii) it is cost-effective and realizes economies of scale in&#13;
administrative costs; (iv) it provides incentives to promote positive behavior changes in&#13;
households; and (v) it is financially sustainable and is capable of evolving over time. The&#13;
success of good safety net programs depends on the details of their implementation. A&#13;
safety net system must have sufficient administration capacity and a well-functioning&#13;
registry of beneficiaries, MIS, and an M&amp;E system to minimize errors of inclusion as well as&#13;
exclusion.46 Furthermore, as the experience from the Productive Safety Nets Program&#13;
(PSNP) of Ethiopia shows (see Annex 10), good implementation requires the flexibility and&#13;
innovation necessary to adjust to local circumstances and to challenges on the ground. In&#13;
the case of Cameroon, a safety net system should also achieve a balance between its two&#13;
key components â&#128;&#146; direct cash transfers and public works programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
109.      A direct cash transfer distributed to individuals in chronic poverty could constitute&#13;
the foundation of this kind of coherent social protection system in the long run. This&#13;
would involve reallocating some social safety net spending on universal subsidies to direct&#13;
cash transfers efficiently administered and targeted to the chronically poor to maximize&#13;
impact. However, the efficient use of resources depends on targeting accuracy, which can&#13;
be difficult and requires strong administrative capacity.&#13;
&#13;

   See Annex 13 for the successful variable benefit formula used in Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s Bolsa Familia program, which&#13;
provides two types of benefits: a base benefit to all families in extreme poverty and a variable benefit that&#13;
varies according to the familyâ&#128;&#153;s composition and income.&#13;

&amp;#12;110.    Experience shows that it is possible to reallocate resources from expensive subsidy&#13;
programs to cash transfers for chronically poor individuals. For instance, in 2005,&#13;
Indonesia reformed its fuel subsidy program to provide cash transfers to the poor (see Box&#13;
4). Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s universal fuel subsidies program cost the equivalent of 5 percent of GDP by&#13;
2005 but mostly benefitted the non-poor. In total, the benefits accruing to the richest 10&#13;
percent of the population from the fuel subsidies were more than five times higher than&#13;
those accruing to the poorest 10 percent. In fact, with the top 40 percent capturing 60&#13;
percent of the subsidy, the poorest quintile received barely 5 percent of the total amount&#13;
allocated to fuel subsidies. In 2005, the government reduced the fuel subsidies by about&#13;
US$10 billion47 and introduced cash transfer programs covering 28 percent of the&#13;
population, which included the poor as well as the near poor. A monthly transfer amount of&#13;
US$10 translated into benefits equivalent to about 17 percent of the per capita&#13;
consumption of those in the poorest decile. Furthermore, the reduction in fuel subsidies&#13;
was implemented with no major public protests as the transfer programs had compensated&#13;
householdsâ&#128;&#153; for any potential welfare loss.48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
47&#13;
   This was precipitated by the escalation in world oil prices along with a concomitant and ongoing reduction in&#13;
domestic production capacity.&#13;

&amp;#12; Box 4: Reform of Fuel Subsidies in Indonesia to Assist the Poor through Cash Transfers&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia has traditionally had little in the way of targeted safety nets. For many years, Indonesia had&#13;
universal price subsidies on fuel, with price levels fixed well below world prices. By 2005, with the rise in&#13;
world fuel prices, the cost of the subsidy was equivalent to 5 percent of GDP. Between 1998 and 2005, fuel&#13;
subsidies averaged three-quarters of the social protection systemâ&#128;&#153;s total subsidies and transfers. As is&#13;
common with such subsidies, they were highly regressive (see figure below).&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The government introduced the first large programs following the 1998 financial crisis. Some of these remain,&#13;
but coverage of the scholarship and health card programs is quite low and the targeting is mediocre. Coverage&#13;
of the rice subsidy is higher, but it has significant cost-effectiveness issues.&#13;
&#13;
In 2005, the government reduced fuel subsidies by about US$10 billion. It reduced total expenditures by&#13;
half that amount. A quarter of these funds were used to fund a targeted, unconditional cash transfer&#13;
program, and the remainder were used for block grants to schools, basic health care and health insurance&#13;
for the poor, and a village improvement program. Given the concentration of people just above the poverty&#13;
line, the government decided to target the cash transfer not just to the 16 percent who fall under the&#13;
poverty line but to the near poor as well. The cash transfer program thus reached 19 million poor and near-&#13;
poor households, or 28 percent of the population. Under the program, each beneficiary family received&#13;
about US$10 per month paid quarterly. The benefit was equivalent to about 17 percent of the per capita&#13;
consumption of those in the poorest decile.&#13;
&#13;
The cash transfer program was rolled out rapidly, with the basic decision to implement the program being&#13;
made in August 2005 and the first quarterly payment being made in October. As expected with such a rapid&#13;
rollout, some initial difficulties arose. The targeting was progressive and a dramatic improvement over the&#13;
prior regressive fuel subsidies, but the haste with which the program was set up showed up in moderately&#13;
high errors of inclusion (see figure below). Early reports also showed that the information provided to the&#13;
public and participants about the programâ&#128;&#153;s purpose and procedures was less than optimal, and channels&#13;
for handling complaints were not well defined. The government worked on these issues, starting with an&#13;
initial assessment of the program after the first payment in 2005, and initiated actions to improve the&#13;
programâ&#128;&#153;s administration. Significant fuel price increases, including for kerosene, were implemented&#13;
without major public protests.&#13;

 The compensation was intended to last just one year and did last just that long. However, the experience&#13;
 led policymakers to become interested in adding an element to Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s anti-poverty policy, which has&#13;
 had little in the way of safety nets and no poverty-targeted cash transfers. In 2007, the government began&#13;
 piloting a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program that would build and improve on the former cash transfer&#13;
 program.&#13;
&#13;
 Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s experience illustrates some of the lessons of safety nets in reform settings and in general. First,&#13;
 cash transfer programs can be useful for compensating households so that they do not suffer sharp changes&#13;
 in welfare. Second, they can reduce opposition to reform. Third, while mounting a program quickly is&#13;
 possible, perfecting it is likely to take longer.&#13;
&#13;
 Sources: Grosh et al (2008) and del Ninno et al (2009).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
111.    The cost that would be incurred to provide a similar cash transfer program in&#13;
Cameroon would be within recent spending levels. If the government were to launch a&#13;
program that provided about 20 percent of the population (3.58 million people) with 24,000&#13;
FCFA annually per person (see Table 25), the total cost would amount to around 95 billion&#13;
FCFA (US$180 million) or close to 1 percent of GDP. A transfer of 24,000 FCFA per person&#13;
would correspond to approximately 25 percent of the annual expenditure of those in the&#13;
bottom quintile and 15 percent of the annual expenditure of those in the second quintile.&#13;
However, unlike in Indonesia, where the poverty rate was at around 18 percent at the time&#13;
of the reform, Cameroonâ&#128;&#153;s poverty rate is approximately 40 percent. Thus creative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       85&#13;
&amp;#12;approaches will be needed to target any cash transfer program to the chronically poor (26&#13;
percent of the population).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
112.   In order to implement a direct transfer program successfully, policymakers will&#13;
need to commission feasibility studies that will establish the objectives and overall scope&#13;
of the programs. The overall objective of cash transfer programs in Cameroon should be to&#13;
target chronically poor households, taking into account how much institutional capacity is&#13;
available to administer the programs. The feasibility studies should provide concrete&#13;
proposals on key design parameters such as the level of transfers, the scope of coverage,&#13;
the duration of coverage, the details of any conditionalities, and the payment modalities. In&#13;
addition, the studies should review and draw lessons from any current or past programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
113.   Complementing direct transfers with a well-conceived public works program can&#13;
provide additional income to those in need and able to work. A large number of&#13;
households in the Northern and extreme Northern regions of Cameroon are exposed to&#13;
drought conditions and seasonal food shortages. A public works program can help those in&#13;
chronic poverty and suffering from food insecurity to smooth their consumption during&#13;
those times when job opportunities are scarce. These public works programs would also&#13;
build and/or maintain crucial village-level infrastructure such as roads, which would be&#13;
beneficial to the community as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
114.   The objectives and scope of public works programs vary greatly. In some countries,&#13;
like in Bangladesh, for example, they are used only for a short period during each year to&#13;
protect a seasonally vulnerable population. In other places, the programs operate&#13;
throughout the year with varying degrees of intensity, thus enabling poor households to&#13;
find paid work to supplement their income, as in the Employment Guarantee Scheme (EGS)&#13;
in India. Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s Productive Safety Nets Program (PSNP) is an example of a mixed model&#13;
in which those who are able to work are required to accept employment in public works&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             86&#13;
&amp;#12;programs in exchange for payments in kind or in cash while those unable to work (generally&#13;
not more than 20 percent of the total assisted) receive cash transfers (see Annex 12).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
115.   As with cash transfers, launching an effective public works program will require&#13;
feasibility studies to define the objectives and scope of such a program. Any public works&#13;
program in Cameroon should aim to meet the needs of the chronic poor and to reflect the&#13;
specific conditions prevailing in the labor market, especially in the northern part of the&#13;
country. The feasibility studies should include concrete proposals on design elements such&#13;
as the number of villages to be included, the number of people to be involved, and the&#13;
length of the projects in months. Typically 75 to 300 people work on a public works project&#13;
site for two to five months (see Box 5 for some key design elements for a successful public&#13;
works project). The larger the number of viable projects that are identified, the more&#13;
villages that will be covered.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;         Box 5: Public Works Programs - Elements Required for Reaching the Poor&#13;
&#13;
Self-targeting by setting the wage rate at an appropriate level. In contexts where poverty targeting&#13;
appears to be particularly challenging and where financial and administrative capacity is limited, relying on&#13;
self-targeting can be attractive. However, this will only be possible if the market wage is above the&#13;
minimum wage. This is because the program wage legally cannot be lower than the minimum wage but has&#13;
to be lower than the market rate for unskilled labor in order to attract only poor to the public works&#13;
program. So if the minimum wage is equal to or above the market wage and restrictive employment laws&#13;
prevent setting the wage below the minimum level, the possibility of using self-targeting is hindered and&#13;
other targeting mechanisms need to be introduced. The use of pure self-selection might also be insufficient&#13;
in reaching vulnerable groups in poor areas or when demand for participation is very large, whereupon&#13;
some form of employment rationing would be needed. The fact that youths aged 15 to 24 constitute one-&#13;
third of the unemployed â&#128;&#147; with young women even hit harder than young men â&#128;&#147; also suggests the need to&#13;
target this category specifically. Setting the program wage too low also presents the risk of excluding those&#13;
poor households that have higher opportunity costs of labor â&#128;&#147; if the program wage is below the reservation&#13;
wage â&#128;&#147; or of failing to achieve a program objective (such as a nutrition objective if the program wage is far&#13;
below the cost of the minimum consumption basket). It is crucial to ensure the program wage is set in&#13;
relation to the project goals.&#13;
&#13;
Providing quality public goods is crucial. Based on international experience, public works should only be&#13;
promoted as a social safety net instrument if the public goods that they generate have a positive impact on&#13;
the community and are built at a cost similar to that charged using hired contracting procedures. They&#13;
should not be introduced as a way to provide social transfers to the â&#128;&#156;deservingâ&#128;&#157; poor. The public works&#13;
involved may be traditional infrastructure such as roads or buildings or they may be public environmental&#13;
improvement projects (such as sanitation projects to combat malaria or natural disaster risk reduction&#13;
projects). They can also be social activities (such as South Africaâ&#128;&#153;s home-based care workers and early&#13;
childhood development workers) or economic activities (small businesses and cooperatives). If the public&#13;
goods that are produced are relevant and are well-executed and maintained, they can play an important&#13;
role in alleviating constraints to higher returns for poor people, regardless of their participation in the&#13;
program. Since 2004, the WFP has promoted synergies between food-for-work programs and school&#13;
feeding and nutrition programs (for example, in projects to build classrooms, storage rooms, and latrines).&#13;
The WFP is also giving priority to community projects that benefit women.&#13;
&#13;
To address chronic poverty, public works programs should run throughout the year with varying degrees&#13;
of intensity. A program that operates only during agricultural slack seasons when the opportunity cost of&#13;
labor is low would provide poor household with a consumption-smoothingâ&#128;&#157; opportunity but no â&#128;&#156;insuranceâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
of work whenever it is needed. A program operating throughout the year with varying degrees of intensity&#13;
will provide poor households with both â&#128;&#156;insuranceâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;consumption-smoothing.â&#128;&#157; In countries with&#13;
widespread unemployment and under-employment, standard short-term public works programs have&#13;
proved incapable of lifting the chronic poor out of poverty. Brazil, Argentina, India, and Bangladesh have all&#13;
operated good practice programs that served the functions of insurance, consumption-smoothing, and&#13;
poverty reduction. To ensure additional coverage, the number of days worked can be rationed and a&#13;
rotation system applied. For instance, the program in India provides a legal guarantee of 100 days of&#13;
employment a year to any rural household willing to do public work for a statutory minimum wage, and&#13;
Ethiopia assists over 7 million chronically food-insecure people â&#128;&#147; about 10 percent of the population â&#128;&#147;&#13;
through its Productive Safety Net Programâ&#128;&#153;s employment schemes and food or cash transfers. Highly labor-&#13;
intensive public works projects can also be effectively used in the aftermath of natural disasters to&#13;
rehabilitate and reconstruct damaged or destroyed infrastructure.&#13;

&amp;#12; C.    Institutional Framework for Safety Nets and Administrative Capacity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
116.   Multiple ministries and departments are engaged in some aspect of social&#13;
protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Le MinistÃ¨re des Affaires Sociales or MINAS) is among the primary ministries&#13;
       involved in social protection and is responsible for devising the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s social&#13;
       assistance and solidarity policies. It has mainly focused on assisting orphans and&#13;
       vulnerable children, the disabled, the elderly, and marginalized population groups.&#13;
       However, the ministry is limited by its very weak implementation capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Le MinistÃ¨re des Travaux Publics and le MinistÃ¨re du DÃ©veloppement Urbain et les&#13;
       Communes) is active in running labor-intensive public works programs in rural areas.&#13;
       These programs have mainly focused on road construction and repair projects.&#13;
       However, the limited number of programs speaks to the weak financial and&#13;
       implementation capacity within both institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Le MinistÃ¨re des Enseignement Secondaire and le MinistÃ¨re de lâ&#128;&#153;Education de Base&#13;
       (MINEDUB) are involved in implementing school fee waivers and school feeding&#13;
       programs to encourage school attendance by children from vulnerable populations&#13;
       families. However, their programs are reliant on continuous donor funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Le MinistÃ¨re de la SantÃ© Publique (MINSANTE) administers fee waiver programs for&#13;
       health services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Le MinistÃ¨re de lâ&#128;&#153;Agriculture et du DÃ©veloppement Rural (MINADER) is involved in&#13;
       emergency food assistance programs in collaboration with donors, particularly the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             89&#13;
&amp;#12;       WFP. It also plays a role in coordinating resources for emergency food assistance&#13;
       programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Le MinistÃ¨re de la Promotion de la Femme et de la Famille (MINPROFF) is, among&#13;
       other things, preoccupied with promoting policies that reduce poverty among&#13;
       women and improving their living conditions. MINPROFF would be the primary&#13;
       ministry involved in mainstreaming gender-sensitive policies in social protection&#13;
       interventions. However, it has so far made only a limited contribution to the&#13;
       implementation of social protection programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Le MinistÃ¨re de lâ&#128;&#153;Emploi et de la Formation Professionnelle and le MinistÃ¨re de la&#13;
       Jeunesse are primarily responsible for the promotion of employment policies in the&#13;
       country. Directly or through various directorates, they implement a number of&#13;
       projects that aim to make labor markets more transparent and to facilitate young&#13;
       peopleâ&#128;&#153;s transition into the workforce.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Le MinistÃ¨re des Finances implements the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s policy on universal and&#13;
       transport subsidy programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
117.   Cross-ministerial coordination will be necessary to build a strong social safety net&#13;
system. While the relative strengths of each relevant line ministry needs to be harnessed in&#13;
the development of the safety net system, a strong inter-ministerial coordination body&#13;
needs to play a critical role both to guide the process and ease weaknesses of&#13;
administrative capacity for scaled up safety nets operations. In a recent bid to revamp the&#13;
safety nets system, this role is being played by the Technical Committee for Monitoring&#13;
Economic Programs (CTS) within MINEPAT, but eventually a social protection committee&#13;
should be created to assume this coordinating role. However, experience from other&#13;
countries indicates that policymakers should take a pragmatic approach to prevent any&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             90&#13;
&amp;#12;bureaucratic bottlenecks that might result from having a multitude of ministerial&#13;
stakeholders involved in the process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
118.    Similarly, the financial, technical, and human capacity of the main ministries&#13;
responsible for social protection will need to be enhanced . As described in Chapter 3, the&#13;
level of coverage of most of the safety net programs is very limited, and scaling up the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s social safety net system will require significant administrative and technical&#13;
capacity, which is currently lacking within the existing ministries of the government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  D.    Political Economy of Safety Net Reforms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
119.    Although the safety net system could be reformed within the current spending&#13;
levels, this would require the complete elimination of universal subsidies, which might be&#13;
politically difficult in the immediate future. Cameroon is less than a year away from&#13;
presidential elections (October 2011), which will be followed by parliamentary elections&#13;
soon after (mid-2012). The government is, therefore, cautious of making any rapid policy&#13;
reforms that could have ramifications for political outcomes. Completely eliminating&#13;
universal subsidies could lead to social unrest (as happened in 2008 as a result of high fuel&#13;
prices as well as the generally high cost of living). The resulting price increases could have&#13;
an adverse impact on low-income groups, given the widespread poverty and youth&#13;
unemployment in Cameroon and the increasing income and wealth inequalities. In turn,&#13;
social instability could lead to political instability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
120.    Therefore, policymakers will need to strike a balance and develop an appropriately&#13;
timed and well-planned strategy coupled with an information campaign to explain the&#13;
reasons behind the reforms. One possibility is for the government to set up viable&#13;
alternative targeted programs for the poorest income groups that can provide feasible&#13;
alternatives. These alternative programs, such as direct transfers and public works&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  91&#13;
&amp;#12;programs briefly illustrated in the forgoing sections, could be initiated before the&#13;
government undertakes universal subsidy reforms. These pilot programs could provide&#13;
valuable lessons on their targeting performance, level of coverage, effectiveness of&#13;
complaints resolution, etc. When functioning properly, they could provide a credible&#13;
alternative for assisting the poor. In concert, information campaign on the programs could&#13;
enable to sensitize the public. Approached in this way, the fiscal burden of universal&#13;
subsidies could be reduced without creating political and social stress.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
121.   A clear and credible roadmap should be drawn up outlining the key steps that will&#13;
lead to necessary reforms and garner political support for them. The road map should be&#13;
preceded by thorough feasibility studies for each program. The pilot programs should be&#13;
rigorously evaluated to learn valuable lessons from their design and implementation. This&#13;
will consolidate political support from decision-makers and key stakeholders.&#13;

&amp;#12; E.    Summary of Key Findings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
122.   Different scenarios that envisage the provision of direct cash transfers indicate&#13;
that it would be possible to cover a significant percentage of the poor within the current&#13;
level of spending on safety nets. If 12,000 FCFA were to be transferred annually to every&#13;
chronically poor individual, the total cost would be only 0.5 percent of GDP (as of 2010). If&#13;
all vulnerable population groups were to be covered, the total cost would be just slightly&#13;
over 1 percent of GDP. Finally, if all poor people under the monetary poverty line were to&#13;
be covered by an amount equivalent to the poverty gap (33,142 FCFA), the total cost would&#13;
be around 2 percent of GDP. Therefore, it is clear that it would be feasible to cover a&#13;
significant portion of the poor within the current budget envelope.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
123.   However, policymakers should carefully consider the political economy of subsidy&#13;
reform before taking any action in that regard. Cameroon is less than a year away from&#13;
presidential and parliamentary elections, and completely eliminating universal subsidies at&#13;
this time could have social and political consequences. Therefore, the government will need&#13;
to develop carefully planned strategies to be implemented within an optimal time frame&#13;
and accompanied with information campaigns. This can be achieved by setting up viable&#13;
alternative programs for the poorest income groups before undertaking subsidy reforms.&#13;
When functioning properly, they can provide a credible alternative for the government. The&#13;
information campaign will help in sensitizing the public about such programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
124.   Cross- ministerial coordination will be necessary to build a strong social safety net&#13;
system. There are currently many ministries involved in various aspects of social&#13;
protection in Cameroon. While some provide leadership in formulating policy, others are&#13;
involved in implementing and supervising social protection programs. In order to reform the&#13;
safety net system, the government will need to exploit the strengths of each ministry. In&#13;
recent years, the CTS within MINEPAT has been coordinating these various ministries, but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              93&#13;
&amp;#12;eventually, a formal social protection committee should assume this coordinating role. As&#13;
with any policy reform, the financial, human, and technical capacities of each ministry will&#13;
need to be enhanced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;CHAPTER V: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The analysis presented in previous chapters leads to the conclusion that the existing social&#13;
safety net system in Cameroon is inadequate to respond to poverty and vulnerability.&#13;
Coverage of existing programs is limited, and interventions are fairly small in scale and&#13;
many are designed mainly as temporary programs. In addition, they suffer from poor&#13;
targeting efficiency. In order to attack chronic poverty and sustainably address food&#13;
insecurity, Cameroon needs to: (i) develop a coherent safety net strategy and set of&#13;
programs; (ii) introduce new safety net programs such as direct transfers and public works&#13;
programs and move towards a well-coordinated set of programs; and (iii) shift away from&#13;
universal subsidy programs towards targeted programs in a few yearsâ&#128;&#153; time to underpin a&#13;
successful safety nets reform. The first step in this direction would be to develop a well-&#13;
considered social protection strategy that identifies and maps risks to appropriate and&#13;
necessary programs. Priority needs to be given to investments in human capital as well as to&#13;
the geographic areas that are most adversely affected by poverty, in other words, the&#13;
Northern and extreme Northern regions of the country. Finally, an implementation strategy&#13;
should be developed to ensure these policy reforms are carried out successfully. This&#13;
strategy should aim to: (i) strengthen the strategic and institutional framework for the&#13;
design, implementation, and management of safety net programs; (ii) increase access to&#13;
basic social services by the poor and vulnerable through efficient safety net programs; (iii)&#13;
strengthen the financial framework for a national social protection system; and (iv) establish&#13;
a robust system of monitoring and evaluation to facilitate informed policy decisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 A.    Summary of Findings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
125.   Chronic poverty and food insecurity are significant problems in Cameroon. As of&#13;
2007, the poverty rate in Cameroon was around 39.9 percent, while chronic poverty stood&#13;
at 26.1 percent. Any social policy should fundamentally address the needs of chronically&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              95&#13;
&amp;#12;poor and food-insecure people. At the national level, the most vulnerable group consists of&#13;
young people up to the age of 15, while rural areas contain a disproportionate number of&#13;
the poor and are particularly exposed to various shocks. Regionally, most chronic poor and&#13;
food-insecure people live in the northern regions of Cameroon.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
126.   Cameroon does not have a coordinated system of social safety net programs&#13;
anchored in a national social protection policy, but only a few isolated and ad hoc&#13;
interventions. It is crucial that the government, with the support of its donor partners,&#13;
addresses the issue of chronic poverty and vulnerability in order to significantly reduce&#13;
poverty. However, it has not made this goal a strategic priority to date, as is clear from the&#13;
lack of an overall social protection strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
127.   Expenditure on social safety nets is limited (0.21 percent of GDP and 0.93 percent&#13;
of the national budget), though with price subsidies, it accounts for 1.63 percent of GDP&#13;
or 7.35 percent of the national budget. Expenditure peaked at its highest level in 2008 at&#13;
0.31 percent of GDP (excluding subsidies) to coincide with the onset of food, fuel, and&#13;
financial crises. The price subsidies represent 6 percent of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s budget, but&#13;
their distributional impact has been largely regressive. Similarly, school fee waiver&#13;
programs (0.13 percent of the budget) were not well targeted to vulnerable households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
128.   In the current spending configuration, resources are not used efficiently to meet&#13;
the needs of vulnerable people. The largest amount of resources is allocated to food and&#13;
fuel price subsidies, which cost the government 213 billion FCFA in 2008. However, the&#13;
better-off segments of the population capture the most of the subsidies. In the other safety&#13;
net programs, geographic targeting and self-selection are used but fail to reach more than&#13;
two-thirds of the intended beneficiaries. Because the individual programs are small and&#13;
poorly coordinated, each has an average coverage level of only 1 percent of the population,&#13;
with all the programs combined covering no more than 6 percent (exclusive of price&#13;
subsidies) of the population. Other safety net interventions are limited in scope and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 96&#13;
&amp;#12;coverage. They mostly consist of emergency interventions in the form of food aid, some&#13;
school feeding, nutritional support, a few public works initiatives, some cash transfers, and&#13;
some fee waiver programs.&#13;

129.    Donors and technical partners are the primary financing source . However, their&#13;
total contribution to safety nets investment is in any case very limited (77 percent of total&#13;
spending on safety nets, excluding price subsidies.) Donors have mainly invested in&#13;
responding to food shortage emergencies and only spent 18 percent of their total&#13;
budgetary allocation to public works and school feeding programs. In addition to subsidy&#13;
spending, the government has spent some money on fee-waivers for hospital costs and&#13;
modest contributions towards public works programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  B.    Policy Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
130.    In this report we make three key policy recommendations as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      97&#13;
&amp;#12;   ï&#130;·   Develop a coherent safety net strategy and set of programs to address the chronic&#13;
       nature of poverty as well as food insecurity in Cameroon. Given the poor targeting&#13;
       performance of current safety net interventions, reallocating funds â&#128;&#147; in particular,&#13;
       reducing spending on subsidies and increasing spending on targeted programs â&#128;&#147; is&#13;
       likely to make a meaningful difference in terms of reducing poverty and&#13;
       vulnerability. This approach will not only make safety net interventions affordable,&#13;
       but it will also enable them to respond to emergencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Introduce new safety net programs and move towards a well-coordinated system&#13;
       of safety nets that efficiently targets resources to the poorest and most&#13;
       vulnerable. A direct cash transfer program that continuously transfers a set amount&#13;
       of money to vulnerable households throughout the year could significantly reduce&#13;
       their vulnerability to chronic food insecurity. In addition, alternative forms of safety&#13;
       net interventions such as labor-intensive public works programs could help them to&#13;
       respond to climate-related shocks and other seasonal income shortfalls.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Move away from universal subsidy programs to targeted safety net programs in a&#13;
       few years time. An effective safety net system that covers the majority of target&#13;
       beneficiaries requires extensive financial resources. Since the countryâ&#128;&#153;s revenue&#13;
       sources are unlikely to create substantially more fiscal space, it seems more realistic&#13;
       to reallocate expenditures from less efficient programs. However, policymakers&#13;
       should consider the political economy ramifications when timing the reform of&#13;
       universal subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 C.    Implementation Strategies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
131.   Four main policy objectives need to be implemented in the short and medium&#13;
terms to establish an effective social protection system. Based on the action plan that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              98&#13;
&amp;#12;Bank team discussed with the government, four main policy objectives have been&#13;
identified: 1) strengthening the strategic and institutional framework for designing,&#13;
implementing, and managing the safety net programs; 2) reducing poverty by supporting&#13;
the consumption of the poor and vulnerable and by increasing their access to basic social&#13;
services through an efficient safety net system; 3) strengthening the financial framework for&#13;
a national social protection system; and 4) establishing a system of monitoring and&#13;
evaluation for social protection. Specific recommendations have been proposed for&#13;
achieving those objectives and detailed steps have been described in the action plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.     Strengthening the strategic and institutional framework for designing,&#13;
implementing, and managing safety net programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(a)    Provide policy guidance and coordination for the design, adoption, and&#13;
implementation of a national social protection strategy. Social protection covers issues&#13;
relevant to several institutions so its coordination and supervision should not be limited to&#13;
one ministry alone. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that a permanent inter-ministerial&#13;
committee for social protection is created. The government has already set up a technical&#13;
committee (the CTS) under MINEPAT that will be responsible for developing the social&#13;
protection strategy, supervising/coordinating various initiatives (such as studies and pilot&#13;
projects), and ensuring that the required dynamic cross-sectoral dialogue among various&#13;
sectoral ministries takes place. A formal social protection committee should eventually&#13;
assume this role, and a sub-committee responsible for safety nets should also be set up in&#13;
order to define the type, role, and instruments that are most suitable for addressing the&#13;
needs of the poor and vulnerable in Cameroon. In addition, policymakers should give due&#13;
consideration to how social protection programs interact with other poverty reduction&#13;
programs, notably labor market programs, pensions, and health insurance, and with policies&#13;
designed to ensure macroeconomic stability, rural development, and human capital&#13;
formation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              99&#13;
&amp;#12;(b)        Strengthen the institutions implementing social protection and social safety net&#13;
programs. Defining who, at the institutional level, will manage the design, implementation,&#13;
and ongoing operation of a social transfer program is a crucial first step after its adoption.&#13;
The best institution to manage the program will be the one that has the following&#13;
characteristics: (i) a durable political commitment to social protection; (ii) the political&#13;
influence to secure resources and defend the programâ&#128;&#153;s priority; and (iii) the institutional&#13;
capacity to deliver an efficient social safety net system. In deciding on these institutional&#13;
arrangements, policymakers need to be informed by a review of relevant institutions, the&#13;
primary objective of the program (for example, poverty reduction versus education), and&#13;
any longer-term vision for social protection in Cameroon.49 Finally, capacity building support&#13;
should be provided. Awareness efforts and training is required both at national and local&#13;
levels to increase understanding, interest, and capacities in social safety nets and social&#13;
protection in general. This may include on-the-job training as well as participation in&#13;
international seminars and study tours in similar countries at advanced stages of&#13;
implementing safety nets and social protection interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.         Reducing poverty by supporting the consumption of the poor and vulnerable and&#13;
by increasing their access to basic social services through an efficient social safety net&#13;
system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(a)        Design an effective safety net system to address chronic poverty and food&#13;
insecurity. Policymakers should begin this process by identifying priority groups that could&#13;
benefit from safety nets based on the results of this report and additional analysis of the&#13;
2007 household survey (ECAM3) and by defining the interventions required to address the&#13;
needs of these priority groups. Appropriate targeting mechanisms also need to be&#13;
developed to ensure that the interventions cover those most in need. Using a combination&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
49&#13;
     Samson et al (2006).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               100&#13;
&amp;#12;of targeting methods â&#128;&#147; geographical, community-based, categorical, self-targeting, and&#13;
proxy means testing â&#128;&#147; is likely to lead to the most accurate and comprehensive targeting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(b)       Increase the efficiency of selected safety net programs by conducting an in-depth&#13;
critical review to learn lessons to be used to make any necessary adjustments. This review&#13;
should primarily focus on increasing the coverage and targeting efficiency of universal&#13;
programs and of food and nutrition programs. Alternative targeting methods should be&#13;
explored, depending on the objectives and scale of the programs. See Annex 12 for some&#13;
good practice examples of the targeting methods used in various safety net programs in&#13;
Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(c)       Launch new programs â&#128;&#147; direct cash transfers and public works programs â&#128;&#147; that will&#13;
meet the needs of the chronically poor and food-insecure. Feasibility studies â&#128;&#147; which&#13;
should establish the objectives and overall scope of the programs â&#128;&#147; will need to be&#13;
conducted to pilot and expand effective direct transfer and public works programs. The&#13;
overall objective of cash transfer and public works programs in Cameroon should be to&#13;
target chronically poor households, taking into account the extent of the institutional&#13;
capacity that exists to administer the programs. The feasibility studies should define the key&#13;
design parameters such as the level of transfers, the scope of coverage, the length of&#13;
coverage, the details of any conditionalities, and the payment modalities. In the case of&#13;
public works programs, the studies should take labor market analysis into account in their&#13;
recommendations about the number of people to be involved and the duration of the&#13;
support and the projects. Finally, the studies should be presented and discussed to provide&#13;
the opportunity to draw lessons and design new programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.        Strengthening the financial framework for the national social protection system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(a)       Set up a sustainable financial framework for financing social protection and safety&#13;
nets programs. This should start by determining the budget envelope needed for a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              101&#13;
&amp;#12;comprehensive safety net and establishing rigorous tracking system of social protection&#13;
expenditures. Once the available fiscal space has been determined, it will be essential to&#13;
identify sources of sustainable financing (for example, the budget, development partners,&#13;
local collectivities, NGOs, or the private sector).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.     Establishing a system of monitoring and evaluation for social protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(a)    Design and set in place a robust monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system for&#13;
safety nets to enable policymakers and program managers to make informed decisions.&#13;
The specific objectives of an M&amp;E system are to: (i) inform the implementation of the&#13;
program and any necessary adjustments in a timely manner; (ii) demonstrate the programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
impact to policymakers, development partners, and general public; and (ii) learn lessons to&#13;
add to the global lessons of experience. The evaluation function is particularly critical for&#13;
evidence-based policy development. A lack of evidence impedes a greater mobilization of&#13;
political and financial support to these programs. Robust monitoring and evaluation will be&#13;
particularly crucial in envisioned pilot projects (e.g., on cash transfers, public works, and fee&#13;
waivers). In particular, six priority actions should be considered: (i) develop a program&#13;
monitoring and evaluation system to assess cost-effectiveness of social safety nets,&#13;
including a cost estimate for such an investment; (ii) set up minimum reporting&#13;
requirements for safety net programs to allow evaluation of effectiveness; (iii) broaden&#13;
monitoring and evaluation to incorporate rigorous impact measurements; (iv) involve civil&#13;
society in monitoring and evaluation; (vi) transmit systematically program evaluation&#13;
reports to the sectoral ministries responsible for social protection and social safety nets and&#13;
maintenance of a database on programs to facilitate better-informed decision-making for&#13;
policy-makers; (vi) strengthen the sectoral ministriesâ&#128;&#153; capacities for monitoring and&#13;
evaluation and provide training for program managers in monitoring and evaluation&#13;
techniques coupled with a mechanism for exchange of experience across programs. Finally,&#13;
as the experience of Zambiaâ&#128;&#153;s Kalmo District Pilot Social Cash Transfer program suggests, a&#13;
good practice procedure for conducting monitoring and evaluation would be to involve an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               102&#13;
&amp;#12;independent â&#128;&#147; preferably outside â&#128;&#147; entity in conducting M&amp;E functions. Please refer to&#13;

&amp;#12;                                 Annex 1: Glossary of Terms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
For many specific terms used in this report, there is no overall consensus on a universal&#13;
definition. In order to avoid misunderstanding, the definitions used in this report are&#13;
presented below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Poverty and Vulnerability&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Chronic poverty: Poverty that endures year after year, usually as a result of long-term&#13;
structural factors faced by the household, such as low assets or location in a poor area&#13;
remote from thriving markets and services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Transitory poverty: Poverty among households who are poor in some years but not all.&#13;
They may be poor in some years due to idiosyncratic or covariate temporary shocks ranging&#13;
from an illness in the household or the loss of a job due to drought or macroeconomic crisis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Vulnerability: The likelihood or probability that a household will pass below the defined&#13;
acceptable threshold of a given indicator and fall into poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Social Protection&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Social protection: The set of public interventions aimed at supporting the poorer and more&#13;
vulnerable members of society, as well as helping individuals, families, and communities to&#13;
manage risks. Social protection includes safety nets (social assistance), social insurance,&#13;
labor market policies, social funds, and social services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Social assistance: Synonymous with â&#128;&#156;social safety net.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              108&#13;
&amp;#12;Social safety net: Non-contributory transfer programs targeted in some manner to the poor&#13;
and those vulnerable to poverty and shocks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Social insurance: Contributory programs designed to help households to insure themselves&#13;
against sudden reductions in income. Types of social insurance include publicly provided or&#13;
mandated insurance against unemployment, old age (pensions), disability, the death of the&#13;
main provider, and sickness.&#13;

&amp;#12;              Annex 3: Factors that Predict the Likelihood of Chronic Poverty&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Factors that predict the likelihood of chronic poverty status include the characteristics of&#13;
the household head, household composition, educational attainment, residential area, and&#13;
access to certain services.&#13;
&#13;
Characteristics of the household head: Households headed by a male are four times more&#13;
likely to be at risk of chronic poverty as households headed by a female. In addition,&#13;
households whose breadwinner participates in non-agricultural activities have a much&#13;
higher likelihood of escaping chronic poverty. For instance, a household whose breadwinner&#13;
works in the formal sector has zero chance of being chronically poor.&#13;
&#13;
Residential area: Relative to urban households, households in rural areas have a much&#13;
higher likelihood of vulnerability and being chronically poor. Urban households are less&#13;
exposed to certain kinds of risks that rural households are exposed to, in particular over-&#13;
reliance on agricultural activities, often subsistence agriculture. The high dependence on&#13;
subsistence agriculture of rural households usually makes them the first victims of climatic&#13;
shocks.&#13;
&#13;
Access to certain important services: Access to electricity, potable water, and health services&#13;
is significantly associated with a reduction in household vulnerability and in the likelihood of&#13;
being chronically poor. Access to clean water improves health status and prevents bacterial&#13;
infections (such as typhoid or cholera). Access to electricity enables households to engage in&#13;
productive economic activities that would otherwise not be feasible. The results of our&#13;
regression analysis showed that a household that has no access to electricity has a risk of&#13;
vulnerability at least 16 times higher than a household with access to electricity. Similarly, a&#13;
household located within 5 kilometers of a health center is 1.5 times more vulnerable than&#13;
a household living closer to a hospital or an integrated health center. (See Annex 4 for more&#13;
details on the evolution of access to services.)&#13;
&#13;
Educational attainment and household composition: The successful completion of an&#13;
additional year of school is associated with a 0.8 percent reduction in the probability of&#13;
being chronically poor. Similarly, household composition plays a role in the likelihood of&#13;
suffering from chronic poverty and vulnerability. As results from the model in Table 3&#13;
demonstrate, households with many children between 5 and 14 years old have a higher&#13;
likelihood of being in chronic poverty than those with no children of in that age bracket.&#13;

&amp;#12;   Annex 12: Some Country Examples of Good Practice in Safety Net Programs in Africa&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Recent financial crises and price hikes have increased policymakersâ&#128;&#153; interest in finding ways&#13;
to address persistent and often deepening vulnerabilities. The success of cash transfer&#13;
programs in many parts of the world has led many leaders to ask whether cash transfer&#13;
programs could be successful in addressing the major challenges that are present in Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa (SSA). This annex examines how cash transfers have been used throughout&#13;
the region and highlights the lessons that have already been learned from existing cash&#13;
transfer programs. Taking into account the context of Cameroon, the following selected&#13;
country case examples could provide valuable lessons about how programs are&#13;
implemented in other African countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In Ethiopia, over 40 percent of the population lives below the national poverty line and over&#13;
20 percent of the population is extremely poor (consuming less than 1.650 kilocalories per&#13;
person per day). Since the variability in rainfall in Ethiopia is among the highest in the world&#13;
and fluctuations in rainfall are inversely related to mean incomes, every year for more than&#13;
two decades the government of Ethiopia has launched an international emergency appeal&#13;
for food aid. This annual emergency assistance was designed to meet the consumption&#13;
needs of both chronically and transitorily food-insecure households. Despite a substantial&#13;
amount of humanitarian assistance, evaluations have shown that emergency assistance was&#13;
unpredictable for both planners and households, often arriving late relative to need. As a&#13;
result of these delays and uncertainties, the emergency aid could not be used effectively&#13;
and did little to protect livelihoods, prevent environmental degradation, generate&#13;
community assets, or preserve household assets (physical or human capital).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              123&#13;
&amp;#12;Characteristics of the Program. Given these shortcomings of the emergency aid regime, in&#13;
2005 the Ethiopian government started implementing a new program, the Productive&#13;
Safety Net Program (PSNP). The PSNP replaced the emergency humanitarian appeal system&#13;
as the chief instrument in the countryâ&#128;&#153;s safety net. The program is currently operational in&#13;
234 chronically food-insecure districts (out of a total of 692 districts) and covered about 7&#13;
million people in 2006. The PSNP provides resources to chronically food-insecure&#13;
households in two ways: (i) by paying the able-bodied poor to participate in labor-intensive&#13;
public works activities and (ii) by paying direct grants to households composed of the&#13;
elderly or those who cannot work for other reasons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Impact of the PSNP. A 2005 beneficiary survey found that the PSNP had had a significant&#13;
positive effect on beneficiariesâ&#128;&#153; well-being as calculated by both subjective and objective&#13;
indicators. The survey found that three out of five beneficiaries avoided having to sell their&#13;
assets to buy food in 2005, and, according to 90 percent of the households, this was due to&#13;
their participation in the PSNP. Moreover, almost half of the beneficiaries surveyed stated&#13;
that they had increased their use of health care facilities and 76 percent of these&#13;
households credited the PSNP with this. More than one-third of surveyed households&#13;
enrolled more of their children in school and 80 percent attributed this to participation in&#13;
the PSNP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Ongoing Reforms. Significant work is planned to further increase implementation capacity&#13;
and to bring systems to a level of functioning not previously possible with fragmented and&#13;
temporary programs. Work is also beginning on a contingent grant mechanism (a&#13;
conditional cash transfer) to provide resources in the same districts to help transient food-&#13;
insecure households during periods of drought. The transfer will go into effect when it is&#13;
triggered by a rainfall-based index that uses 30 years of rainfall data. Moreover, the PSNP is&#13;
complemented by a larger food security program that tries to help households to raise their&#13;
incomes by means of resettlement grants, household income-generating packages, and&#13;
water harvesting. Households that benefit from the PSNP are also entitled to assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              124&#13;
&amp;#12;under other parts of the food security program. However, food security interventions&#13;
financed by donors that fall outside the PSNP are rarely coordinated at the local level, and&#13;
their links to basic rural services are also weak.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Lessons Learned. The PSNP illustrates many of the issues that surround safety nets in very&#13;
low-income countries, namely:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ï&#131;&#152; The program is moving in a clearly beneficial direction by means of a basic design that&#13;
     not only seeks to use resources in ways that save lives but also assist in strengthening&#13;
     livelihoods. The progress to date in implementing the PSNP suggests that this is&#13;
     possible even in a very low-income setting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ï&#131;&#152; The design process and implementation planning have undergone a fairly harsh triage.&#13;
     Even when fully realized, the program will only provide a safety net in about a third of&#13;
     the country. The districts selected are appropriately the poorest, but many poor&#13;
     people also live in the unserved districts. Moreover, the program has phased its&#13;
     implementation. It is focusing first on consolidating the basic PSNP. It hopes to enrich&#13;
     it eventually in a number of dimensions. But program managers and donors have&#13;
     realized that everything could not be accomplished right away. Thus, for example, the&#13;
     contingent fund for droughts was not implemented until the third year of the PSNP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ï&#131;&#152; Good implementation requires diligent and sustained effort. By 2007, the program&#13;
     had had many positive outcomes, and early qualitative assessments of its targeting&#13;
     and impacts have been positive, but more remains to be done to consolidate its&#13;
     implementation. Good implementation also requires flexibility and innovation. For&#13;
     example, the government was initially having problems with the programâ&#128;&#153;s monitoring&#13;
     system, but in the interim, it deployed so-called rapid response teams to visit districts&#13;
     to identify and solve any implementation problems. This gave managers a sense of&#13;
     what was going well and what was not and whether adjustments were needed in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               125&#13;
&amp;#12;     individual districts or at a more systemic level. Meanwhile, the design of the&#13;
     monitoring system was simplified and a pilot to computerize it is under way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ï&#131;&#152; An important part of the reform is the shift to a multi-donor, multi-year framework&#13;
     rather than an annual emergency appeal system with each donor running a separate&#13;
     initiative. This is complemented by the decision to deliver the program through&#13;
     regular government systems rather than through the special implementation units&#13;
     that are common in donor-funded programs. The multi-year framework and the&#13;
     reduction in fragmentation should permit the development of much more effective&#13;
     administrative systems. The multi-donor framework should also make the program&#13;
     more sustainable in that a withdrawal or a reduced commitment by a single donor will&#13;
     have a less deleterious effect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Kenya Cash Transfer Program for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This transfer programs began as a pre-pilot in 2004. It has since gone through a five-year&#13;
pilot project and its budget has been scaled up to a projected US$26 million budget for&#13;
fiscal year 2010 (World Bank, 2009). Because it has been extensively documented, the&#13;
program has provided valuable lessons on the advocacy, design, and implementation of&#13;
conditional cash transfers in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is a key component of Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s broader&#13;
social protection strategy, as it addresses risks to children in communities where the large&#13;
and growing number of OVCs, exacerbated by adult deaths from AIDS, has begun to&#13;
overwhelm informal safety net systems. In addition to donor interest, the CT-OVC has&#13;
received strong domestic political support, to the extent that policymakers have exerted&#13;
pressure on the government to quickly scale up the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Objectives of the Pre-pilot Program. The goal of the pre-pilot was to generate evidence&#13;
about the applicability of using a cash transfer program to support OVCs in Kenya. The pre-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             126&#13;
&amp;#12;pilot phase began in December 2004, initially covering 500 children, and was later expanded&#13;
to reach at least 5,000 children. The pre-pilot was supported by UNICEF and SIDA and&#13;
administered by the Department of Children Services (World Bank, 2009). The programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
initial districts â&#128;&#147; Nairobi, Kwale, and Garissa â&#128;&#147; were selected because they were areas where&#13;
UNICEF and SIDA already had ground-level knowledge and experience. The pre-pilot&#13;
targeted poor households and households containing OVCs that did not receive any other&#13;
formal support. Beneficiaries received Ksh.500/US$6.25 monthly per child (SCUK et al,&#13;
2005). Technically, the pre-pilot transfers had conditions attached, but there were no&#13;
consequences for non-compliance (World Bank, 2009). Concerns that children would be&#13;
separated from their households in order to meet program requirements led the&#13;
enforcement of conditions to be dropped (World Bank, 2009). However, communities and&#13;
some donors requested that the transfers be conditioned, particularly when the program&#13;
expanded to the west in areas with higher HIV levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CT-OVC Redesigned for Full Pilot. Drawing on the pre-pilot experiences, the official pilot of&#13;
the CT-OVC program began in 2005 and ran until mid-2009. The program specifically&#13;
focuses on households with OVCs, with the goal of keeping children within families and&#13;
encouraging investments in their human capital. The programâ&#128;&#153;s specific goals are very&#13;
similar to those of the well-known CCT programs in Latin America, including improving&#13;
health, nutrition, and educational attainment and increasing awareness of these issues. The&#13;
pilot program envisaged reaching seven districts with support from the Government of&#13;
Kenya, the DFID, UNICEF, and SIDA (World Bank, 2009). Funding from development partners&#13;
for the pilot enabled it to reach 17,500 households that are still being covered by benefits.&#13;
Between 1,000 and 4,600 beneficiary households are covered in each of the districts. By&#13;
the end of Phase 2 (June, 2009), 70,000 households were receiving benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Complex Five-step Targeting Approach. The targeting method adopted for the pilot was&#13;
refined from the methods used in the pre-pilot. The targeting has five steps (World Bank,&#13;
2009). Geographic targeting is used to select program districts based on their poverty and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             127&#13;
&amp;#12;HIV/AIDS levels. The districts are ranked based on the number of extremely poor OVC&#13;
households in each district. Within the districts, the number of households with OVCs is&#13;
calculated. The communities to be targeted by the program are those with more than 5,000&#13;
community members, of whom at least 60 percent have to live below the poverty line&#13;
(Hussein, 2006). Community committees (Location OVC Committees) were created to select&#13;
eligible households within each of those communities. The households must not be able to&#13;
meet all of their basic needs, and they must include a permanent OVC member under 17&#13;
years old in the household who is not receiving benefits from another cash transfer&#13;
program (Government of Kenya, 2006). Within this group of eligible households, Location&#13;
OVC Committees decide which households meet three of a list of over 10 items related to&#13;
poverty (such as whether the household has access to a safe water source, the members&#13;
are in poor health, or the members eat one or fewer meals per day). Households that meet&#13;
at least three of the criteria are considered poor (World Bank, 2009).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Post Office Functions Well for Paying Transfers. The transfer was set at a level that was&#13;
believed to cover enough of the needs of OVCs to ensure that they remained within their&#13;
households. Transfer values vary by the number of OVCs in the household. Ksh.1,000&#13;
(US$14) is given to households with one or two OVCs. Ksh.2000 (US$28) is given to&#13;
households with three or four OVCs, and Ksh.3,000 (US$42) is given to households with five&#13;
or more OVCs (World Bank, 2009). Using Ksh.1,500 (US$20) as a reference transfer value,&#13;
the transfer is similar to the average of Ksh.1,800 per adult equivalent for consumption. The&#13;
transfer is, therefore, approximately equal to 20 percent of poor Kenyan householdsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
expenditures (World Bank, 2009). However, the transfers have not been indexed to&#13;
inflation, so their value has eroded as food prices have risen. The Postal Cooperation of&#13;
Kenya was chosen to deliver the transfers in the pilot districts, which has been found to&#13;
function well. The transfers are paid once every two months (Government of Kenya, 2006)&#13;
along with a receipt stating whether the household received the full monthly payment and&#13;
if not, why not (Government of Kenya, 2006). The payments are given to the mother of the&#13;
household or the female head/caregiver whenever possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             128&#13;
&amp;#12;Soft Enforcement of Conditions. Similar to the conditions attached to cash transfer&#13;
programs in Latin America, the beneficiaries of Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s CT-OVC program must agree to&#13;
certain co-responsibilities relating to child health and education: (i) beneficiaries under 1&#13;
year old must attend a local clinic six times within their first year to receive immunizations,&#13;
vitamin A supplements, and to have their growth monitored; (ii) beneficiaries between 1&#13;
and 3 years old must have a growth monitoring check-up and receive vitamin A&#13;
supplements twice per year; (iii) children between 6 and 17 years old must enroll in school&#13;
and maintain attendance for 80 percent of all school days; (iv) and OVC caregivers must&#13;
attend educational seminars at least once annually (World Bank, 2009). However, until very&#13;
recently, these conditions have not been put into operation, in effect making the transfer&#13;
unconditional. The program was designed in part to test the payment of a conditional&#13;
versus an unconditional transfer, but this design component did not begin to be tested until&#13;
late 2008. Thus far, there has been some confusion over how to apply the health conditions,&#13;
so only the education conditions have been applied. In areas where the conditions are&#13;
required, non-compliance results in a reduction in the transfer of Ksh.400 per child or adult&#13;
who does not carry out his or her co-responsibilities (World Bank, 2009). The transfer stops&#13;
being paid if there is no longer an OVC under 17 years old in the household or if the&#13;
household is reassessed and is no longer deemed to be poor. Households that migrate out&#13;
of the program area voluntarily withdraw, while those that are found to have falsified any&#13;
information are expelled from the program (World Bank, 2009). If households fail to fulfill&#13;
their co-responsibilities for three consecutive payment periods, they are removed from the&#13;
program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Organization and Management System Requires Inter-sectoral Coordination. The pilotâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
central program unit, comprised of units for operations, monitoring and evaluation,&#13;
administration/finance, and information systems, was originally situated within the&#13;
Department of Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Services in Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s Ministry of Home Affairs (Government of&#13;
Kenya, 2006). The Vice-President has ultimate control over the program (Hussein, 2006).&#13;
The enforcement of the conditions requires close coordination between the line ministries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              129&#13;
&amp;#12;and the central program unit as the education objectives are to be executed by the Ministry&#13;
of Education, and the health objectives are executed by the Ministry of Public Health and&#13;
Sanitation. Other coordination with the Ministry of Medical Services and Ministry of&#13;
Immigration and Registration of Persons is also being supported (World Bank, 2009).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Analysis of Results Awaited from Experimental Evaluation Design. Significant measures&#13;
have been taken to maintain adequate controls in the pilot, including the use of an&#13;
extensive management information system (MIS). The current MIS is centered at the&#13;
national level but will later be decentralized to the districts (World Bank, 2009). Teachers&#13;
and health care workers fill out forms reporting school attendance and health center visits&#13;
by beneficiaries. The central MIS tracks this information by district. Conditions are&#13;
monitored every two months for children ages zero to 1, every six months for children ages&#13;
1to 5, every three months for the educational conditions, and once every year for the adult&#13;
training sessions. The application of conditions is supposed to be spot checked, for example,&#13;
by visits to beneficiary households to ensure that they are complying. Appeals may be&#13;
submitted to the District Children Office, which also accepts complaints concerning&#13;
payments and the quality of supply side services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Impact Evaluation of the Program. The pilot program in the original seven districts was&#13;
subject to an impact evaluation, conducted by Oxford Policy Management, with both&#13;
qualitative and quantitative components. The evaluation design of the program is&#13;
experimental (although there were significant differences between the treatment and&#13;
control groups), in which two treatment locations and two control locations are randomly&#13;
selected within each of the seven districts. The unconditional/conditional design was also&#13;
randomly assigned (Hurrell et al, 2008). The baseline sample includes 2,759 households. The&#13;
impact evaluationâ&#128;&#153;s analysis of targeting revealed that most selected households did include&#13;
an OVC (98 percent) and that most of these households were poor. However, the extremely&#13;
poor were underrepresented in the program (Hurrell et al, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              130&#13;
&amp;#12;Strong Government Ownership and Funding and expansion included in the Medium-term&#13;
plan. The CT-OVC is included in Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s Medium-term Plan and Vision 2030. The Kenyan&#13;
government allocated US$675,000, or Ksh. 48,000,000 to the CT-OVC program in 2005-2006&#13;
(Hussein, 2006). Because of its expansion, the program is expected to cost US$26 million in&#13;
FY10. This figure is 0.08 percent of nominal GDP and 0.31 percent of government&#13;
expenditures. When the program reaches 100,000 households it is expected to cost&#13;
between US$32 million and US$35 million or approximately 0.07 percent of nominal GDP&#13;
and 0.28 percent of government expenditures (World Bank, 2009). The administrative costs&#13;
of the program are expected to be approximately 25 percent by 2012, down considerably&#13;
from the 40 percent administrative costs in the pre-pilot, and they are expected to continue&#13;
to drop.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CT-OVC Adaptations for Phase Three. The political pressures for the CT-OVC pilot to be&#13;
expanded more rapidly into additional districts have resulted in two programs running&#13;
alongside each other. A new (third) program phase now seeks to harmonize these two&#13;
programs and build the capacity to ensure their effective implementation. The goal of the&#13;
Government of Kenya is to cover 100,000 poor households containing OVCs by 2012&#13;
(approximately 2,000 households per district), in order to cover approximately half of the&#13;
600,000 extremely poor OVCs in the country (World Bank, 2009). During the third phase:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ï&#131;&#152; The targeting mechanism will be adjusted based on the evaluation results, Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     Integrated Household Budget Survey, the MIS, and baseline data. Improvements will&#13;
     be made to the program based on lessons learned in the second phase.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ï&#131;&#152; The MIS will be upgraded to enable it to efficiently handle the greatly increased&#13;
     demands due to the rapid scale-up of the program, and an organization will be&#13;
     contracted to provide external monitoring. As part of that external monitoring, the&#13;
     organization will spot-check the program, conduct community censuses to evaluate&#13;
     the quality of Local OVC Committees, and conduct so-called â&#128;&#156;citizen report cardsâ&#128;&#157; that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            131&#13;
&amp;#12;     will gather information on the opinions of both beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries&#13;
     and on their satisfaction with the program. This strengthened accountability is&#13;
     particularly important in light of concerns over governance and corruption in Kenya&#13;
     (World Bank, 2009).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ï&#131;&#152; Extensive efforts will be made to improve the dissemination of information about the&#13;
     program to both beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. The implementation and&#13;
     monitoring of the co-responsibilities is expected to improve.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ï&#131;&#152; By mid- to late 2010, testing of the use of penalties resulting from householdsâ&#128;&#153; non-&#13;
     compliance with co-responsibilities should be complete (World Bank, 2009).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ï&#131;&#152; Evaluations of supply-side capacity will also be conducted to encourage crucial&#13;
     capacity building. Program officials have had notable achievements in implementing&#13;
     the program and increasing capacity already, but more must be done to meet the&#13;
     challenges of the continued expansion of the program (World Bank, 2009).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Malawi Cash Transfer Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Social Cash Transfer program began in 2006 with UNICEF support as a pilot in the&#13;
Mchinji district with the goal of scaling it up eventually into a national program. Its objective&#13;
is to decrease the poverty, hunger, and starvation of extremely poor households and those&#13;
with no member able to participate in the labor force. This includes many households with&#13;
orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Characteristics of the Program. The objective of the Mchinji Social Cash Transfer Pilot was&#13;
to address extreme poverty. Schubert and Huijbregts (2006) reported that around 10&#13;
percent of all Malawian households (250,000) are extremely poor and incapable of working&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              132&#13;
&amp;#12;(in other words, labor-constrained or labor-incapacitated). It was suggested that, if that 10&#13;
percent of households all received social cash transfers, the countryâ&#128;&#153;s extreme poverty rate&#13;
would decrease from 22 percent to 12 percent at a cost of US$41 million per year. This&#13;
analysis contributed to the decision to target 10 percent of extremely poor households in&#13;
the targeted pilot area of Mchinji, equal to approximately 3,000 households or 15,000&#13;
individuals (Chipeta and Mwamlima, 2007). In addition to its objective related to poverty&#13;
reduction, the program sought to increase the enrollment and attendance of beneficiary&#13;
children in school, to provide information about how well a cash transfer program could fit&#13;
into Malawiâ&#128;&#153;s social protection agenda (Chipeta and Mwamlima, 2007), and to test whether&#13;
District Assemblies could implement cash transfer programs that were both cost-effective&#13;
and able to reach targeted household groups (Schubert and Huijbregts, 2006). Mchinji was&#13;
chosen for the pilot due to its strong district team, average poverty levels, and relatively&#13;
close location to the capital of Lilongwe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Targeting of the Mchinji Pilot Includes Elected Village Committees. The programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
targeting criteria classified the extremely poor as those in the bottom expenditure quintile&#13;
and below the national extreme poverty line. Based on this definition, beneficiary&#13;
households should be unable to purchase needed non-food goods. Labor-constrained&#13;
households are those with a dependency ratio of over three (Schubert and Huijbregts,&#13;
2006). To select these households, local committees known as Community Social&#13;
Protection Committees first create a list of all households that they think may fulfill the&#13;
programâ&#128;&#153;s requirement of being â&#128;&#156;ultra poorâ&#128;&#157; or â&#128;&#156;labor-constrained.â&#128;&#157; These committees are&#13;
elected during the initial program meeting (Schubert, 2007). The village headmen are not&#13;
allowed to be on the committees. The committees must then visit and interview all&#13;
potential beneficiary households, after which the village headman must verify this&#13;
information, and the committees then ranks the identified households according to their&#13;
level of need. A community meeting is then called to discuss the ranking and to either&#13;
approve or change it. The information is passed to the Social Cash Transfer Scheme&#13;
Secretariat (see below) and the Social Protection Sub-Committee in Mchinji, which must&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              133&#13;
&amp;#12;approve or disapprove of the list. The lists are supposed to contain the 10 percent of&#13;
households in the community agreed to be most needy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Design and Delivery of Transfers. The value of the monthly transfers in Mchinji, all&#13;
unconditional, depended on the householdâ&#128;&#153;s size and the number of children in school. One&#13;
person households received MK.600 (about US$4), two person households received&#13;
MK.1,000 (US$6.67), three person households received MK.1,400 (US$9.33), and four&#13;
person households or larger received MK.1,800 (US$12) (Schubert and Huijbregts, 2006).&#13;
Households with children in primary school received an additional MK.200 (US$1.33) per&#13;
child, and households with children in secondary school earned an additional MK.400&#13;
(US$2.67) per child. This bonus was not tied to school attendance but was simply given&#13;
when school-aged children were in the household. The average transfer value was&#13;
MK.1,700 (US$11.33)50 per household monthly, which was deemed large enough to fill the&#13;
extreme poverty gap in targeted households (Schubert and Huijbregts, 2006). There were&#13;
3,000 beneficiary households by the beginning of 2008, and expenditures were US$43,000&#13;
monthly (Miller et al, 2008). The expansion of the pilot was postponed because of funding&#13;
delays, but it was able to reach seven districts by the end of 2008 (Horvath et al, 2008). As&#13;
of April 2009, the scheme reached 92,786 beneficiaries in 23,561 households in seven&#13;
districts (UNICEF, 2009).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Mechanisms and Financing. The Social Cash Transfer program was&#13;
implemented locally. The Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Department&#13;
of Poverty and Disaster Management coordinated the pilot with help from UNICEF (Chipeta&#13;
and Mwamlima, 2007). The Mchinji pilot was implemented by the local assembly, whose&#13;
District Executive Committee had a Social Protection Sub-Committee with line ministry&#13;
representatives. This sub-committee approved applications to the program. The Malawi&#13;
district structure has officers that come from various departments and are able to support&#13;
&#13;
50&#13;
  Standardizing the exchange rate to that reported previously; this is slightly different from rate used in&#13;
Schubert and Huijbregts (2006).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   134&#13;
&amp;#12;the program. Capacity is limited at the district level but not as constrained as in some other&#13;
countries such as Zambia where a similar program is being implemented (Schubert and&#13;
Huijbregts, 2006). Below the sub-committee is the Social Cash Transfer Scheme Secretariat&#13;
with personnel who implement the program, control the budget, and perform periodic&#13;
monitoring. Below this, the Village Development Committee is in charge of the Community&#13;
Social Protection Committee, which both targets and tracks beneficiaries (Schubert and&#13;
Huijbregts, 2006). The Community Social Protection Committee teams receive&#13;
remuneration to compensate them for some of the activities that they carry out (Schubert,&#13;
2007).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
For the pilot, UNICEF provided technical assistance, supported the setting up of the&#13;
program, funded the transfers until December 2006, and supported advocacy and capacity&#13;
building in Malawi. Specifically, UNICEF funded visits of government representatives to&#13;
Brazil and Zambia, workshops, and field trips to Mchinji. Additional funding to scale up the&#13;
program in 2008 and 2009 came from the National AIDS Commission through The Global&#13;
Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The Global Fundâ&#128;&#153;s contributions to the scale&#13;
up were around US$8.8 million, and the National AIDS Commission funds were used&#13;
because approximately 70 percent of beneficiary households have been affected by&#13;
HIV/AIDS (Schubert, 2007). The EU planned to fund external monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
The country has expressed interest in obtaining further financing from development&#13;
partners through a basket fund after the Social Cash Transfer has been incorporated into&#13;
the National Social Protection Strategy and has received full Cabinet support (Schubert and&#13;
Huijbregts, 2006). Other donors in a pool fund were expected to be the World Bank, the&#13;
DFID, CIDA, and NORAD (Horvath et al, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Challenges in Evaluation Design. Internal monitoring is carried out through the production&#13;
of monthly reports on the costs, activities, and outputs of the program. UNICEF and USAID&#13;
support a joint external program evaluation conducted by Boston University and the Center&#13;
for Social Research in Malawi (Miller et al, 2008). Targeting evaluations were completed in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             135&#13;
&amp;#12;March and June of 2007, and a systems evaluation was conducted in October of 2007. The&#13;
baseline household survey was conducted in treatment and comparison village groups in&#13;
March of 2007 before treatment households received a grant. Follow-up surveys were&#13;
carried out in August/September 2007 and in March 2008, and qualitative data were&#13;
collected from October/November 2007. However, it appears that experimental methods&#13;
were compromised in the evaluation. The Mchinji District Secretariat chose which village&#13;
groups were treatment and comparison groups, while both treatment and comparison&#13;
households were selected using the community targeting methods, and comparison&#13;
households did not understand that the research was unrelated to their grant receipt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Lessons Learned. The targeting evaluation of the Mchinji Program found much scope for&#13;
improvement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ï&#131;&#152; Almost one-third of community members in program areas thought the targeting was&#13;
     not fair. The evaluation suggested that less subjective indicators be used to determine&#13;
     program beneficiaries and that targeting should be more objective, standardized, and&#13;
     transparent (Miller et al, 2008). Depending on their definition of eligibility, the&#13;
     exclusion errors in communities ranged from 37 percent through 68 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ï&#131;&#152; Beneficiariesâ&#128;&#153; food consumption and diversity had improved over that of the&#13;
     comparison group. In addition, the health of both children and adults had improved,&#13;
     and self-reported school attendance and the capacity of children to study had&#13;
     increased. Child labor had also decreased significantly in the treatment group, while&#13;
     the comparison groupâ&#128;&#153;s labor did not change. The evaluation also concluded that the&#13;
     productivity of beneficiary households had increased since they received the transfers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ï&#131;&#152; The expected cost of scaling up the program nationally to 273,000 households (1.2&#13;
     million individuals of whom 60 percent are expected to be OVCs) is around US$55&#13;
     million annually or 1.4 percent of GDP (Schubert, 2007). In June of 2007, the delivery&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              136&#13;
&amp;#12;   of the transfers cost less than 2.5 percent of program costs, and administrative costs&#13;
   were less than 15 percent of the program costs (Horvath et al, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï&#131;&#152; The program has faced significant challenges, including: (i) the need for more, better-&#13;
   trained district-level staff; (ii) ongoing concerns over household dependency and&#13;
   corruption in the program (Chipeta and Mwamlima, 2007); (iii) dealing with a high&#13;
   turnover of government employees; (iv) the need for improved financial mechanisms&#13;
   to transfer funds at high levels and an improved MIS system to connect district and&#13;
   national-level data; (v) the need to put a complaints/appeals procedure in place&#13;
   (UNICEF, 2009); and (vi) the need for increased government commitment, particularly&#13;
   from the Ministry of Finance, and additional capacity building at all levels of&#13;
   government in anticipation of the scaling up of the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           137&#13;
&amp;#12;             Annex 13: International Good Practice Design Features for Direct Support&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Based on good practices in the design of social assistance (direct support) programs, four&#13;
design features are fundamental:51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Selection of Households for Direct Support&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It is common knowledge that the more generous the definition of eligibility, the larger will&#13;
be the pool of applicants for social assistance and the cost of the program. The cost of the&#13;
program also depends on the level and duration of benefits (discussed in the section&#13;
below). For example, for the old age social assistance pension program, Nepal defined the&#13;
cut-off age limit for eligibility as 75 years old. This undoubtedly restricted the pool of&#13;
beneficiaries and kept the program within the limits set by the available budget, but the&#13;
program could not reach some of the critical vulnerable groups even slightly below the age&#13;
of 75. On the other hand, some countries set the limit for eligibility as low at 60 (or even&#13;
lower), leading to the opposite effect of having too many beneficiaries and a very large&#13;
budget. To overcome difficulties of this kind, many countries now limit the cash transfer&#13;
social assistance to, say, the poorest 10 percent of the population. One such example is the&#13;
Kalomo District Pilot Social Cash Transfer program in Zambia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
How eligibility is determined and how eligible beneficiaries are selected has varied a great&#13;
deal from one country to another depending upon (i) administrative feasibility and (ii) the&#13;
available information. Where both these sets of conditions are weak, countries (such as&#13;
Rwanda) have resorted to using community-based targeting approaches. However, good&#13;
practice dictates that the lists of beneficiaries that are compiled using this approach should&#13;
be validated in some transparent way. For example, in Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s conditional cash transfer&#13;
program, Oportunidades, the initial beneficiary lists are presented at community meetings&#13;
51&#13;
     Grosh et al (2008).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               138&#13;
&amp;#12;where participants can bring up any possible exclusion and inclusion errors. In all cases, a&#13;
complaints mechanism is critical for ensuring community satisfaction with the targeting&#13;
approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In countries where the information constraint is less severe, programs often use a proxy&#13;
means test (PMT). This is a targeting method by which a score for each applicant is&#13;
generated based on household characteristics that are fairly easy to observe, usually non-&#13;
income characteristics such as the location and quality of the housing unit and the&#13;
householdâ&#128;&#153;s ownership of durable assets, number of children, and level of education among&#13;
others. A threshold score level is set and households who fall below this level become&#13;
eligible for the benefit. When a community targeting approach such as the one described&#13;
above is adopted, it is still possible to move gradually to using a PMT method, short-list&#13;
households for the benefit, and then use community meetings to ensure transparency and&#13;
avoid exclusion and inclusion errors. Many low-income countries are using this combination&#13;
of a PMT and community validation as a way to select beneficiaries for social safety net&#13;
programs, one recent example being Bangladesh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Determining Benefit Levels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Determining the size of the benefit in social assistance direct support programs is a tricky&#13;
issue in all countries. It is hard to provide clear-cut policy advice based on international&#13;
experience, but some guiding principles can be offered. Typically, in last resort programs&#13;
such as the one proposed for Rwanda, which aims to reduce extreme poverty, the benefit&#13;
levels are set as a fraction of the income gap of target beneficiaries. How high or low that&#13;
fraction should be depends on the available budget and the number of people in extreme&#13;
poverty. Using a proxy means test, Armenia and Georgia have used this principle.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               139&#13;
&amp;#12;In this regard, it might be helpful to do some number-crunching with the available&#13;
household-level information. For example, information on the number of extremely poor&#13;
households can be combined with information on their income (poverty) gap and, from&#13;
both of these sets of information, it is possible to derive the financial requirements for a&#13;
given level of benefit. It then becomes possible to assess the feasibility (affordability) of&#13;
alternative benefit levels and decide on the level that can be defended within the available&#13;
budget envelope.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Benefit levels need not be fixed at a flat level for all types of households. Variable benefit&#13;
formulas are often the norm in many countries, mainly because such formulas take account&#13;
of variations in household circumstances (such as the number of children, the presence of a&#13;
disabled child or person, or the long-term sickness of a household head). A very good&#13;
(successful) example of such a variable benefit formula is that of Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s Bolsa Familia&#13;
program. It provides two types of benefits â&#128;&#146; a base benefit to all families in extreme poverty&#13;
and a variable benefit that depends on family composition and income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Whatever method is adopted to determine the benefit level, it is useful to assess the level&#13;
of the benefit as a percentage of the consumption expenditure of extremely poor&#13;
households. How generous the program is can be assessed from this proportion. The higher&#13;
the benefit level as a percentage of the householdâ&#128;&#153;s consumption expenditure, the more&#13;
generous the program. Maintaining a generous benefit level is likely to affect the labor&#13;
supply through adverse disincentive effects; that is, households, even when provided with&#13;
opportunities to work in the labor market may opt to stay in the â&#128;&#156;generousâ&#128;&#157; program. While&#13;
this concern for the impact of benefit levels on work disincentives is theoretically valid, it&#13;
does not apply to programs that target extremely poor households with disabled or elderly&#13;
members and no able-bodied adults capable of participating in the labor market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               140&#13;
&amp;#12;Delivery Mechanisms and Payment Modalities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Four principles generally guide the delivery mechanism: (i) ensuring the reliability and&#13;
regularity of payments; (ii) maintaining accountability (governance issues) and preventing&#13;
fraud; (iii) reducing transaction costs for the beneficiaries; and (iv) minimizing the&#13;
administrative costs of delivering the payment. While a number of delivery agencies or&#13;
routes are available â&#128;&#147; bank branches, mobile banks, post offices, decentralized government&#13;
agencies, or NGOs â&#128;&#147; which method is chosen must satisfy the above four principles, and be&#13;
available and suitable for a given country situation. Not surprisingly, countries have varied a&#13;
great deal in this regard. If contractors or a specific agency are/is selected, performance-&#13;
based incentive contracts can be developed as was done in the Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s Bolsa Familia&#13;
program. Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s pilot Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC)&#13;
program used a bidding process to select the lowest-cost service agency. The advantage of&#13;
these contract-based service agencies is that the contracts can be revised based on their&#13;
performance. In countries with a fairly well-developed IT infrastructure, debit cards and&#13;
smart cards are being used to transfer cash assistance. In the state of Gujarat in India, a&#13;
pilot program is using smart cards to transfer in-kind social assistance. It is hard to&#13;
recommend one specific option or delivery mechanism. The main challenge is to adapt any&#13;
one reliable mechanism to a countryâ&#128;&#153;s specific circumstances and to avoid any unintended&#13;
adverse effects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation of Cash Transfer Programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Program monitoring is extremely important for any safety net program and especially for&#13;
cash transfer programs. Systematic monitoring helps program managers to assess how well&#13;
the program is being implemented at all levels, and enables them to make mid-course&#13;
corrections in the event of poor implementation. Evaluation complements the monitoring&#13;
system, inasmuch as assesses the distributive effects of cash transfer programs. Despite the&#13;
critical importance of monitoring and evaluation, unfortunately most safety net programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               141&#13;
&amp;#12;lack a credible monitoring and evaluation system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring is a continuous activity and is typically done at all levels â&#128;&#147; village, district, and&#13;
national. Its main role is to assess whether or not the program is being implemented in&#13;
accordance with its design and is having the outcomes that were expected. The annual cost&#13;
of monitoring must be factored into the program costs, and it must become an integral part&#13;
of the programmatic framework. A good monitoring system must collect information on the&#13;
programâ&#128;&#153;s key outcomes. A good practice procedure is that monitoring should be done by&#13;
an independent agency that is entirely separate from the institution that is implementing&#13;
the program. A well-documented international example of good monitoring comes from&#13;
Zambia. The Kalmo District Pilot Social Cash Transfer program (which operated with&#13;
technical assistance from Germany) implemented third-party monitoring that assessed the&#13;
quality of program management, the effectiveness of targeting, the regularity of transfer&#13;
payments, and even beneficiariesâ&#128;&#153; use of the transfers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It is not enough to know the programâ&#128;&#153;s outcomes; it is also crucial to know the impact that&#13;
the program is having on household welfare, which is the ultimate goal of a cash transfer&#13;
program. Two approaches are available for carrying out an impact evaluation. One is a&#13;
quantitative approach that collects information on a random sample of households&#13;
belonging to both the treatment group and the control group, both at the launch of the&#13;
program and after a given period of time (say after one year). Econometric techniques are&#13;
then used to assess the impact of the program.52 A complementary approach is qualitative&#13;
evaluation, which is based on focus group interviews, key informant interviews, and direct&#13;
observation. Though qualitative evaluations are not representative, they do offer rich&#13;
information on the programâ&#128;&#153;s functioning, merits, and shortcomings.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;A variant of descriptive evaluation is â&#128;&#156;process evaluation,â&#128;&#157; which is probably the most&#13;
common evaluation technique followed in most countries. Its approach is to assess and&#13;
document how each of the processes underlying a cash transfer program is being&#13;
implemented. It helps to answer the question: What is happening through the program?&#13;
Process evaluation strongly complements, but does not substitute for, an internal&#13;
monitoring system and other evaluations mentioned above. The Zambia example is worth&#13;
repeating. It included a process evaluation by external evaluators in addition to other&#13;
evaluations that helped to improve the monitoring capacity as it revealed specific flaws in&#13;
specific processes underlying the programâ&#128;&#153;s implementation.&#13;

&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
&#13;
This report lays the groundwork for a safety net system that can address the needs of the&#13;
poor in Cameroon. Cameroon does not have a coordinated system of safety nets; rather, small,&#13;
isolated interventions which together do not address the needs. Moreover, food and fuel price&#13;
subsidies which mainly benefit the rich cost around 2 percent of GDP/yearâ&#128;&#148;much more than&#13;
total safety net spending. There is a need for a social protection strategy and an effective&#13;
safety net system to address chronic poverty and food insecurity in Cameroon. This strategy&#13;
should identify risks and vulnerabilities so they can be addressed by appropriate programs.&#13;
Investments in human capital and in geographic areas most affected by povertyâ&#128;&#148;the North&#13;
and Far Northâ&#128;&#148;should be priority.&#13;
