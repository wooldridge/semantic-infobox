&#13;
Q: Good morning. It's Thursday, November 14th, 2002. I'm in the I Building at the&#13;
World Bank headquarters in Washington. I'm William Becker with George Washington&#13;
University and the Business History Group.&#13;
&#13;
Q: And I'm Marie Zenni, Task Manager of the Bank's Oral History Program.&#13;
&#13;
STEK: And I'm Pieter Stek. I was Executive Director for the Netherlands until November the&#13;
1st, and now I'm in the overlapping period with my successor.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Very good. Well, thank you, Mr. Stek. It's a pleasure to meet you, and we're very pleased&#13;
that we were able to put this interview together on a relatively short notice. As Mr. Stek said, he&#13;
is the outgoing Dutch Executive Director, and he has responsibility for 12 countries in that&#13;
capacity, or had that responsibility until November 1st. We'd like to begin by talking a little bit&#13;
about your experience before you came to the Bank, if you could talk a little bit about your&#13;
educational background?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: I was born in England before the war. We moved to Holland when I was ten and, after&#13;
catching up on the Dutch curriculum, I went to secondary school near The Hague and studied&#13;
economics in Amsterdam. The economics was mainly macro and monetary, welfare economics&#13;
and public finance.&#13;
&#13;
Q: And so that led, then to your working for, among others, the Dutch Central Bank and the&#13;
Ministry of Finance?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Yes, that's right, twelve and a half years at the Bank, and eighteen or something at the&#13;
Ministry.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Now, what in that experience at the Dutch Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance do you&#13;
think was most relevant to your appointment as Executive Director at the Bank in 1996?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Well, at the Bank you learn to think independently, dispassionately. I had a terrific boss&#13;
there, a second-generation Hungarian Dutchman called Andre Szasz. He was a great model.&#13;
Then the Finance Ministry opened up the horizons because the Central Bank is frequently&#13;
somewhat narrow, certainly with the limited mandate in the Netherlands of taking care of the&#13;
currency and its value, internally and externally. So broadening was very important for me.&#13;
While at the Ministry, I became Chairman of the Committee on Financial Markets of the OECD&#13;
[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development], and I did that for about 13 years. I&#13;
also became the Chair for two or three years of the Alternates of the Monetary Committee, as it&#13;
was then called--later, the Economic and Financial Committee of the European Union. That was&#13;
a very good experience when I became a Board [of Executive Directors] committee chairman&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Pieter Stek&#13;
                              November 14 and 15, 2002 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
here in Washington. One of the more useful earlier experiences was also being a member of the&#13;
Board of the Bank for Dutch Municipalities. I was on that Board for many years.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So, in view of your career path and familiarity with the Bretton Woods Institutions, what&#13;
kind of adjustments, if any, did you find were necessary to make upon becoming a member of&#13;
the Bank's Board?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: My first job was at the International Affairs Department of the Central Bank. It was the&#13;
time of the SDR [special drawing rights], and I was sent to Washington for a year and a half as a&#13;
Technical Assistant, as it was called in those days, to the Dutch ED [Executive Director] at the&#13;
IMF [International Monetary Fund]. I had learned all about the SDR, thinking it would replace&#13;
the dollar, but somehow it never happened. In my naÃ¯vetÃ©, I believed that the dollar was on its&#13;
way out. Looking back on it one smiles at oneself. I thought it was scandalous that the U.S. was&#13;
not willing to give up the dollar. Then, after a spell of domestic stuff in the Netherlands, both in&#13;
the Bank and the Ministry, I went back to foreign financial relations and took care of the Bretton&#13;
Woods Institutions, the Regional Banks, the European Union and some OECD stuff. So that&#13;
explains the knowledge from the outside and a little bit of the inside, but when you get here you&#13;
realize that you need to be more courteous than is common in the Netherlands, and you mustn't&#13;
try to make jokes all the time. First of all, people don't always understand jokes; secondly, some&#13;
cultures don't like it all that much. I learned that from a number of my constituency countries:&#13;
don't try to make people laugh at the first sentence. OK?&#13;
&#13;
Q: And that's proved a good lesson?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: That's a good lesson, although I still stray occasionally.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. Upon becoming Executive Director, what did you initially set out to accomplish, and&#13;
what were the pressing issues you had to focus on?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: When I came here in November â&#128;&#152;96, the Bank was still very unpopular in the outside&#13;
world. We'd just had the Annual Meetings with â&#128;&#156;50 Years Is Enoughâ&#128;? in Madrid. The [Willi W.&#13;
A.] Wapenhans Report was still being digested, and the reactions had not had their impact yet,&#13;
and many further measures were needed. So the point was, there was a strong need not only to&#13;
improve the perception in the outside world, but indeed to make some major adjustments in how&#13;
we dealt with our business--specifically a need for greater focus, greater selectivity, and better&#13;
management, to put it briefly. There was too big a gap between what was said to the outside&#13;
world in order to improve the perception for a number of years and what was really happening.&#13;
The ideals, in the course of my period at the Bank, were given flesh. Client orientation really&#13;
became a serious matter. Selectivity in terms of selecting priorities--a special kind of selectivity--&#13;
became real, but the internal organization had not yet adjusted. A very elementary thing there&#13;
was that the budget process did not work in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q: And so the budget process was also one of your goals?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Pieter Stek&#13;
                              November 14 and 15, 2002 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STEK: I've never been on the budget committee, thank God, so I am by no means an expert on&#13;
the budget, and even though I come from the Finance Ministry, I don't like the subject. However,&#13;
it was very clear that the Bank was a mess.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. As the Executive Director of a number of countries at different stages of economic&#13;
development, how did you balance the varying interests and demands of your constituencies,&#13;
especially since some are third-world countries, others second-world, and some are advanced&#13;
industrial nations?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: The existence of the IMF and the World Bank itself is proof that there must be a&#13;
common interest. They wouldn't have been so successful in binding together the countries of the&#13;
whole world if there had not been that common interest, so I don't feel that this distinction&#13;
between types of countries is so terribly fundamental. We have a joint interest in improving the&#13;
situation in the world, and that interest is not even hard to describe. I mean, if economics and&#13;
trade are not a zero sum game, everybody can improve their situation by enabling each other to&#13;
do what they are good at. Now, some countries need a bit of a push, and it's to the advantage of&#13;
the developed countries to give that push and not to make it incredibly burdensome for the&#13;
developing countries through the conditionality. One can at least try to aim for an optimum.&#13;
&#13;
The problems of countries are also basically the same. For a long time, many economists thought&#13;
developing countries were really a different animal, but they're not. That's something we've&#13;
become aware of now. It must be 20 years ago, I would say, at least, and so we've moved away&#13;
from this thought that developing countries need very special solutions to their problems. But the&#13;
point is that they have much tougher situations, and the pain of making mistakes is much greater&#13;
than in industrialized countries.&#13;
&#13;
Q: To what extent do political situations of the various countries in your constituencies&#13;
impinge on your work? Or do they?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: When I came in, one of my countries was Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that obviously&#13;
was a pretty fraught situation because peace had only been restored recently. The Bank had only&#13;
been at work there for roughly a year and had been a very dynamic partner, as a matter of fact, to&#13;
Bosnia. But the internal situation was such that there was no trust and no real willingness of the&#13;
parties to collaborate. That evolved slowly, and I was proud to be a small part of that. Thanks to&#13;
the confidence-building efforts of my Bosnian assistant, Zlatko Hurtic, I managed to organize the&#13;
first dinner that the Republika Srbska and the Federation representatives--Croats and Bosnians--&#13;
had with each other. They started telling jokes in the course of the dinner, which were hair-&#13;
raising. They're tough cookies; let there be no mistake. We did something similar in Brussels&#13;
half a year later, and that worked, too.&#13;
&#13;
Croatia was also very difficult because they had a regime that was not held in high regard in the&#13;
West, the Tudjman regime, which was very nationalistic. At some point the Bank and the IMF,&#13;
particularly the Bank, because of pressure of their shareholders, were not able to continue with&#13;
the program. I objected because I thought this politicizing contradicted the Articles of Agreement&#13;
and made a very principled statement. It didn't help because the major shareholders don't budge&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          Pieter Stek&#13;
                             November 14 and 15, 2002 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
because of a valid statement. There was never an answer to the statement, but, you know, you&#13;
had to do what was right by the Articles.&#13;
&#13;
Then Israel is one of the member countries of our constituency, and there we regularly had&#13;
political issues, often because of glitches in the way Bank operations in West Bank and Gaza are&#13;
presented to the world. It's a complicated situation, and there's no intent (as far as I can judge),&#13;
but occasionally there are pronouncements from the West Bank and Gaza that make it appear&#13;
that the Bank is, let's say, on the side of the Palestinians, and that then creates a big rumpus for&#13;
obvious reasons. Or the Bank publishes the wrong map, where every country in the region is&#13;
mentioned except Israel, and then there is always some kind of explanation, which is not totally&#13;
convincing, and there's not even a footnote explaining why West Bank and Gaza is spelled in&#13;
capitals, and Israel is not there. These are very sensitive issues, and then some newspaper picks it&#13;
up. There's so much Bank documentation, and frequently you don't even see the stuff yourself&#13;
until you're warned from the outside. Then the Bank has to make amends under pressure from&#13;
our office and to try and find ways of preventing that kind of thing from recurring. These are, in&#13;
a way, micro issues. A big issue for Israel is loans to countries that they regard as financiers of&#13;
terrorism.&#13;
&#13;
As for the transition-country borrowers, their political situation varies quite a lot, whether it's&#13;
their values, the strength of their democracies, the strength of their governance, et cetera. At the&#13;
same time, they all have the same problems. They have to bring about major change in what are&#13;
vested interests frequently linked with the power structure of the past, and that is highly political&#13;
and very difficult, and one is in continuous contact with that issue.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How would you describe the G5 countriesâ&#128;&#153; understanding of borrowersâ&#128;&#153; needs?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: It's interesting that you say the G5, because these are the single country constituencies.&#13;
Their understanding is not as good as it should be, and it depends very much on the individual&#13;
Executive Directors of such countries, whether they take the trouble to broaden their views.&#13;
Moreover, they have another major weakness, and that is that they tend to get instructions from&#13;
their capitals, which again, depending on the quality of their representative, can prove to be&#13;
rather stifling for the debate. So I think the G5 is an element, obviously, of power in the&#13;
institution, but that power is not put to the best effect.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How does it compare, for instance, with that of the Nordic-Baltic group?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Let me say one more thing. Thank heavens the G5 do not always agree with each other.&#13;
And as you may remember, in Madrid they were outvoted anyway, if I remember correctly, by&#13;
the rest of the world. Perhaps it was the G7 even that was outvoted. In comparison with the&#13;
Nordics--I don't know why you select them because the four major developed ones and Iceland&#13;
outweigh the others by far, which makes them basically a Part One constituency--a real mixed&#13;
constituency with significant numbers of borrowing countries in the constituency is more&#13;
interesting. In a constituency like ours, and the Swiss and the Belgians, to some extent, although&#13;
there you also have Austria and Hungary as well as the Czech and Slovak republics, which by&#13;
now are almost industrialized countries. So the real comparison is with us and countries and&#13;
constituencies like ours, of which there are not too many. I think we do have a better&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Pieter Stek&#13;
                              November 14 and 15, 2002 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
understanding of the issues and of how to achieve that optimum we were talking about earlier in&#13;
policies which enable the countries to use the money to good effect and yet not constrain them&#13;
excessively. So I'm very happy with the mixed constituencies. I also think they're a force in the&#13;
Bank. The previous U.S. ED always recognized that publicly. Jan Piercy said she was very&#13;
jealous of us, and she was one of those EDs who did a lot of hard work in trying to catch up on&#13;
the as-it-were innate disability of the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In your opinion, why has the EU [European Union] decided to maintain the status quo in&#13;
renouncing an attempt to unify its presence and representation and speak with a unanimous voice&#13;
in financial institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Well, in the IMF, the situation is different from the World Bank. Of course, there's a&#13;
monetary union with a euro in the center, and clearly there needs to be a voice, and there is a&#13;
voice for the euro center of the monetary union. But the U.K. and Sweden are not part of that,&#13;
and so even there you have a need for a separate voice of certain countries, very definitely, and&#13;
moreover, macro issues are linked with monetary issues, and budgetary policy is not harmonized.&#13;
That's still a power of the individual governments. So even in the IMF, there is no good reason to&#13;
say that a country should give up its individual place. In the World Bank there is even less reason&#13;
because development policies are not harmonized.&#13;
&#13;
There would be a real concern, I think, in my constituency, to give up our independent voice,&#13;
because we have a totally different approach to development from some other members of the&#13;
Union, like France. For example, we have a large development budget, and we wouldn't want&#13;
that to be controlled by outsiders. If there were to be a single EU chair, the interest in providing a&#13;
lot of development assistance might decrease in the Netherlands. Moreover, we have a strongly&#13;
overlapping agenda with the World Bank itself. So the World Bank would lose a major element&#13;
of support, and looking at this from the position of the Articles of Agreement, so would the&#13;
global interest, the common interest. The World Bank needs its supporters in the Board who&#13;
strongly believe in the rule of law and in not politicizing the issues.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Turning to the Board structure and its role as a decision-making body in the Bank, in your&#13;
opinion should governments endeavor to appoint high-level senior officials as EDs, as was done&#13;
at times in the past, and would the Board benefit then from such presumably independent-&#13;
minded individuals?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: When I was posted with the IMF 32 years ago, one of these very high-level persons was&#13;
the Dutch ED. Professor [Pieter] Lieftinck had been the Minister of Finance who had cleaned up&#13;
the Dutch financial system after the war in a really very solid and thorough way. He was well&#13;
known in the history of the Bank and the IMF as a Director for both institutions. Working with&#13;
him was a marvelous experience for me. So I would not say that countries should not bring in&#13;
very senior people when they are available. At the same time, itâ&#128;&#153;s always a matter of choice. You&#13;
can send a very bright young person who is independent-minded, and you can send a very senior&#13;
person, as long as that person is also independent-minded and not the mouthpiece of his&#13;
authorities. I think that is the most important part, that you believe in the institutions and that&#13;
you're independent-minded. If one, as a rule of thumb, takes it to be true that senior people have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           Pieter Stek&#13;
                              November 14 and 15, 2002 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
more experience--and there's also something going for a senior person to cope with a strong&#13;
management, including the Chairman of the Board--a high-level appointment can be very good.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In your view, is the two-year renewable term of Board members an adequate period for&#13;
them to master the overwhelming array of complex issues on which they are supposed to develop&#13;
an independent opinion, even for the few who come with prior understanding of the institution?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: I think that is a defect in the Articles of Agreement, and it would be welcome if there&#13;
was a way of changing them in a limited technical sense without creating all kinds of risks for&#13;
the Bank and the IMF. I doubt whether that is possible, but it would be great if we could reach an&#13;
understanding that people will not be sent for less than three, or preferably even four years. Itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
very harmful, I think, to have people who have just gained enough experience and have achieved&#13;
a fuller understanding--even that doesn't always happen in two years, but it gives you an&#13;
opportunity--and then they have to leave. Of course, there is a counterpoise to some extent, now&#13;
that the assistants and advisors have become a power in the institution. They only started&#13;
cooperating closely with each other three or four years ago, and they take care of continuity--as&#13;
long as they donâ&#128;&#153;t leave at the same time, which they donâ&#128;&#153;t. Some of them stay for quite long and&#13;
some, including executive directors, even stay for too long. If itâ&#128;&#153;s more than six years, itâ&#128;&#153;s too&#13;
long.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Your predecessor, Eveline Herfkens, developed an induction program for EDs during her&#13;
time as Dean of the Board. What has been the impact of such a program?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: That program has been very beneficial. I had a bad induction to start with because it&#13;
was in a room with a long, narrow table with bad acoustics, and the Bank had not yet discovered&#13;
the existence of microphones in those days. It was at the Hay Adams. But even that was already&#13;
helpful. After that, rapid improvements in the induction program were brought about. A great&#13;
deal of thought is put into the structure and content of the program, and it has become a powerful&#13;
instrument to get new EDs online. It also helps to create cohesion between the EDs, but that's a&#13;
separate question.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How do you reconcile the duality of loyalty and responsibility in your role both as an&#13;
official of the Bank and in representing the interests of your authorities?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: I think itâ&#128;&#153;s important to make clear what hat you're wearing when youâ&#128;&#153;re taking a&#13;
position. I do not find it very difficult to do that, as a matter of fact. When I'm talking for Israel, I&#13;
make that clear. The Bank itself has elements of procedure that see to it that you donâ&#128;&#153;t disturb the&#13;
open debate by defending the narrow interests of a single country all the time. You're not meant&#13;
to make a fundamental oral statement when the country assistance strategy of one of your&#13;
countries is discussed. You write a yellow and people can read it or leave it, but that is&#13;
understood to be a defense of the country and not necessarily fully to cover what is in the interest&#13;
of the Bank. When thereâ&#128;&#153;s a project in a country, you're not meant to talk at all, if it's your&#13;
country.&#13;
&#13;
So the real issue is with the Board members who are under instruction. First of all, you're not&#13;
allowed to take instructions, if you read the Articles carefully. You're an officer of the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                               November 14 and 15, 2002 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the Bank pays you, but the facts of life are that Board members do take instructions. Usually you&#13;
sense when they are talking with their country hats on and when not. In passing, it is less likely&#13;
that an ED for a mixed constituency will receive or follow instructions, because this could lead&#13;
to tension between the members of the constituency. So the real issue is whether members of the&#13;
Board put on their Bank hats often enough.&#13;
&#13;
This was debated quite thoroughly at the Executive Development Program in Harvard. Some&#13;
EDs went there for six weeks, but as the Board we went there for three days. I was in that latter&#13;
group, not because they thought I was a fast learner, but I'm afraid it was because they thought it&#13;
would be wasted on me to spend six weeks in Harvard. Anyway, a fundamental issue was that if&#13;
Board members do not wear their Bank hats, you cannot expect Management to be as transparent&#13;
as it should be and to display as much candor as it should. That's the trade-off. In [James D.]&#13;
Wolfensohn's time, the Bank has become more candid internally than it was in the past towards&#13;
the Board, in my opinion, but there needs to be something in return from the Board, and that&#13;
goes up and down. There are some very good moments, and there are also some pretty bad ones.&#13;
&#13;
Q: I think you've begun to address this next question, but what impact does this duality have on&#13;
the effectiveness of the Board? Do you want to talk some more about that?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Letâ&#128;&#153;s think of an interesting case, which strikes me just now. There is an issue of the&#13;
degree of micromanagement which the Board should or should not try to exercise in its relation&#13;
with Management. A number of members like to go into great detail. I think that is wrong, and it&#13;
does not help for the candor. It certainly doesn't help for the effectiveness of the Bank. In my&#13;
view, the U.S. likes to manage in some detail a lot of what is going on, manage it from the&#13;
Treasury, and the tightness of the instructions to the ED is related to that. I think that is harmful,&#13;
but there is a major issue, at the same time, of whether you should give adjustment loans and&#13;
programmatic loans to countries and at what stage. There is an issue of governance, which the&#13;
U.S. is right with other countries to point to. So the trade-off should not be between adjustment&#13;
loans and micromanaging, but should be based on the level of responsibility and effectiveness in&#13;
management and in governance that is being achieved in the country. It should not be based on&#13;
the preferences of a Part One country on how the Bank should be run.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How does the growing role of NGOs and their agendas influence your role?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: The NGOs are interesting, particularly the ones that are not single-purpose NGOs,&#13;
single-issue NGOs. When you have a very strong statement from a single issue NGO, perhaps&#13;
followed up by thousands of emails, then that's not really interesting. This is a complicated world&#13;
where you need to achieve a balance between various policy objectives and you need to achieve&#13;
a minimum level of protection against what may go wrong in environmental terms or in&#13;
protection of indigenous peoples or in terms of water management or whatever. But if the NGOs&#13;
go beyond that, they can be interesting if they look at the broader panoply of issues, like Oxfam&#13;
does. As a matter of fact, I have a bit of difficulty in thinking of very many other NGOs that have&#13;
such a general approach and cover basically the whole agenda of the Bank. That doesn't mean&#13;
that Oxfam is always right, but thereâ&#128;&#153;s a critical constructive relationship there which is useful.&#13;
Oxfam has played a good role in education, for universal primary education, and on other issues&#13;
too, for example, the PRSPs (Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers). But I would say we are not&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
governed by them at all in our constituency. We are not afraid of them. We do try to look&#13;
carefully at what they say, particularly the local NGOs in the borrowing countries may have&#13;
points, which escape notice unless you do.&#13;
&#13;
The Western NGOs have a useful role in facilitating their interaction with us, like the Bank&#13;
Information Center, which regularly brings visitors from my countries to my office and from&#13;
other countries, too. But the broader views of Western NGOs, while possibly useful, are not a&#13;
dominant constraint on what we do. I'm not quite sure how powerful they are in the U.S. One&#13;
sometimes gets the impression that while they make a lot of noise, perhaps they do not have all&#13;
that much of an impact. Be that as it may, they can open your eyes to important issues, and if&#13;
that's taken over on the Hill in the U.S., that can be quite important. But I expect people are not&#13;
all that impressed when thereâ&#128;&#153;s a bias, a strong bias in the position that's taken.&#13;
&#13;
NGOs have this fundamental weakness that you usually donâ&#128;&#153;t know how representative they are&#13;
themselves or who finances them. However, while democracy in advanced countries usually has&#13;
a fundamentally representative structure, in our borrowing countries the NGOs can be a very&#13;
useful addition, particularly where democracy is not full-fledged yet. Then you have to listen&#13;
more carefully to understand what's really taking place at the level of the population.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In 1995, the size of the Board was increased to 24 members. In your opinion, is the Board&#13;
too large to function effectively? And should the single-country executive directorship be&#13;
eliminated?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Well, the Board could usefully be smaller, but there are no easy solutions to that&#13;
because some of the constituencies are already very large. It's also very hard to envisage single-&#13;
country constituencies giving up their power, although I think they could learn a lot, as we&#13;
discussed earlier, from having borrowing members with them. At the same time, the borrowing&#13;
members of, let's say, G15 countries who might think of joining G5 countries might be worried&#13;
their positions would not be taken into account in any real sense. So that's why I'm not optimistic&#13;
about a reform of that nature. A smaller Board would be useful, but given the size of the African&#13;
constituencies, the Canadian constituency, the Belgian, Swiss, and Dutch constituencies, it&#13;
doesn't look very promising to go in that direction. Some Latin-American constituencies also&#13;
have a significant size, and it's hard to see us dividing up our countries over the G5, plus China,&#13;
Saudi Arabia and Russia. I do think that it's wrong that a country with such a low level of income&#13;
plus some nukes is a single country constituency. I do think Saudi Arabia, which is still floating&#13;
on the wave of its single largest-creditor position of the â&#128;&#152;70s, should have been dealt with long&#13;
ago.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Are there constitutional or institutional factors limiting the effectiveness of the Board&#13;
function?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Being a resident Board helps a lot, compared with ordinary Supervisory Boards. While&#13;
it creates a temptation to micromanage, not only for the U.S., which is basically a resident&#13;
shareholder, for the other countries it's helpful as a lever. Management may be willing to be&#13;
candid, but Management may not even be fully briefed itself all the time. It's very useful to be on&#13;
the spot and have all these links between the staff and assistants and advisors, or advisors and&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
senior advisors, as they're called nowadays. This makes it extraordinarily difficult for&#13;
Management to hold a veil over what is really happening. At some point, the real issues become&#13;
clear. As this is an institution where you need the support of the shareholders and you don't want&#13;
the shareholders high-handedly to take stupid measures that are damaging for the institution, it's&#13;
very important that they get feedback from the Board on what the real issues are, and about&#13;
sensible approaches to dealing with them. That's why a resident Board is a very powerful&#13;
instrument in containing the stupidity of major shareholders.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How adequate have the various efforts at streamlining Board procedures been, and, in your&#13;
opinion, what remains to be done?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Under Alex [Alexander] Shakow as the Acting Secretary of the Board, the efforts have&#13;
been very effective. One could first of all point to the [Bassary] Toure Report, but Alex was&#13;
already improving Board behavior by imposing constraints on the Board before that. While we&#13;
usually, when I came, started meetings about 10 minutes late, he managed to impose discipline&#13;
on the Board, and we started on time with just one or two minutes' delay. Now that can easily&#13;
slip again, although there are now flashing lights and that sort of thing, and even a tone that goes&#13;
off at some point once or twice. However, there are lots of aspects to efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Looking at simplification of Board procedures?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: You know, there's a continuous struggle to get Management to write brief documents,&#13;
clear executive summaries, and make useful introductions at the start. And in fact, in all these&#13;
areas there has been major improvement. There is a discipline among most parts of Management&#13;
to see to it that their introductions are not too long, that their answers to Board comments are&#13;
direct. Yellows are responded to mostly directly at the start of the meeting. So the interaction is&#13;
quite effective, and I'm not unhappy with the improvements that have taken place. The role of the&#13;
committees has improved enormously in my time. That may be one of the major factors, as a&#13;
matter of fact. Committee discussion is not all that much use if everything is reopened at the&#13;
Board meetings. So the way the Committee discussion is presented to the Board in a statement or&#13;
a green sheet and the structure of that paper is very important to guide the Board and stimulate it&#13;
to focus on remaining issues. This has proved to be quite effective in limiting the amount of time&#13;
spent in Board discussions, which is all the more important because the Board agendas have&#13;
become very overloaded. Board behavior has improved a lot, both due to the physical discipline&#13;
of the six minutes' time limit and to the better preparation through the committees.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Seeing that the Board is representative of a broad range of interests, how difficult is it to&#13;
reach a consensus, especially when contentious issues arise from concerns over geopolitical&#13;
issues, as in the case of the U.S. exercising its veto power, given its unique position as the largest&#13;
single shareholder?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: On the whole, itâ&#128;&#153;s not all that difficult to reach a consensus for most of the issues, if one&#13;
doesn't interpret a consensus as meaning 100 percent agreement of Board members. I'm not&#13;
aware immediately of a geopolitical issue that has made the achievement of consensus very&#13;
difficult, unless you're referring to an issue like that of loans to Iran. Would that be one of the&#13;
cases?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: That would be one.&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a case where the U.S. voted against, and there were one or two other countries,&#13;
and I had a problem within my constituency because I thought it was a political standpoint which&#13;
was trying to be forced onto the Bank. Of course, my country, Israel, knows a hell of a lot about&#13;
Iran and regards it as a terrorist country, and so does the U.S. At the same time, as a constituency&#13;
we didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to contravene the Articles, so I had a very complicated situation. I managed, in&#13;
the first instance, not to mention Israel separately. However, Israel was not happy that they were&#13;
not mentioned as being opposed while accepting that the constituency as a whole would go&#13;
along. Now, I explained to them that split voting is not allowed in the Bank, so I was trying to&#13;
cover their position by careful use of language without mentioning that there was a split in the&#13;
constituency. They didnâ&#128;&#153;t really buy that because in the prevailing domestic political situation&#13;
there was an outcry there: â&#128;&#156;Dutch Director votes for loans to Iran.â&#128;? So that was pretty rough.&#13;
&#13;
But the U.S. doesnâ&#128;&#153;t have a veto power for most issues. For changing the Articles and for one or&#13;
two other things, they just have a few votes more than the 15-percent limit, and I canâ&#128;&#153;t even&#13;
remember having that kind of vote.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Itâ&#128;&#153;s 17 percent now.&#13;
&#13;
STEK: In the IMF, particularly, there are one or two issues in the SDR field which require an&#13;
85-percent majority. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve forgotten now about the Bank Articles, whether there's anything that&#13;
requires 85 percent.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How can the slow process of IDA [International Development Association] replenishment,&#13;
generally fraught with political hazard, be improved upon in light of the decline in ODA [official&#13;
development assistance]?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: I was part of the lengthiest IDA negotiation. I was the Deputy in IDA, under IDA 11,&#13;
working from the Netherlands. That enabled me to see a large part of the world, ending in&#13;
Tokyo, finally. IDA is obviously not an easy issue when you have countries that want to be very&#13;
generous and countries that want to be very tight-fisted. That is a much greater issue than the&#13;
degree of conditionality. There is also quite a strong sense amongst most IDA deputies that IDA&#13;
shouldn't be scaled down in relative terms within total assistance. So it's not easy to think of&#13;
mechanisms to reach agreement, let alone to increase the size, which would be effective all&#13;
through the various replenishments. It depends very much on the US Administration, on whether&#13;
the Japanese are in good shape or not to continue providing assistance at a high level, as well as&#13;
whether countries are working under tough budgetary constraints or not.&#13;
&#13;
 The U.S., for as long as I can remember, has been very difficult and tight-fisted. In the very&#13;
early days the U.S. also had 0.7 percent of GNP as its level of assistance, but that went into steep&#13;
decline very rapidly.&#13;
&#13;
 It's hard to make a prediction whether the decline in ODA will continue or not. Certainly the&#13;
ongoing effectiveness discussion is very important. The IDA replenishment gets a real boost&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
from improved effectiveness of development assistance. Effectiveness is also related to&#13;
governance, so it's also very important for the Bank to find the mechanisms to apply selectivity&#13;
in the sense of not being too generous to countries that waste the money, to put it bluntly. That is&#13;
always tough because the built-in tendency of a Country Director is to see the best in a country.&#13;
It's not conscious distortion, but you want to help the country and you see that the people need it,&#13;
and it's very hard all the time to say, â&#128;&#156;Yes, but we know that the effectiveness may not be all that&#13;
great,â&#128;? because a dollar may be diverted to individual pockets or for different purposes.&#13;
&#13;
The IDA Deputies have created a tight framework of conditions that need to be fulfilled in order&#13;
to achieve the highest allowable level of IDA relative to the size of the country, and if you don't&#13;
meet the conditions, you sink quite rapidly to a low level of IDA assistance. That is, in a way, a&#13;
strong example to the Board for the Bank borrowers. At the same time, this process is governed&#13;
perhaps a bit too much by the Part One narrowness. So while I agree with the need for&#13;
selectivity, this may have gone a bit far.&#13;
&#13;
Q: The Bank has recently agreed to provide up to 22 percent in grants instead of the current&#13;
seven percent. What, in your opinion, might be the ramifications for the Bank in terms of IDA&#13;
re-flows?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Well, that's a technical question. Only after about 10 years does it start having an&#13;
impact on us, but it's bad. In my view, it's an incredibly misconceived policy because there are&#13;
plenty of grants in the system already through the UN system, the European Union, namely the&#13;
EDF (European Development Fund), and bilaterals.&#13;
&#13;
An IDA credit is not a credit in the full sense but close to a grant. Basically, it is an&#13;
administrative charge that brings an element of discipline into the system, which is very useful&#13;
because it's necessary to administer and to have transparency of the books. The fact that an IDA&#13;
credit is not costless leads to better allocation of the resources both in the country and in the&#13;
institutions. There's a real risk that the institutions themselves will be under the temptation, if&#13;
they give a grant, to follow less closely in the longer term what's happening.&#13;
&#13;
I really regret that we've moved to this percentage. It will decrease our effectiveness. It was a&#13;
total misconception on the part of Secretary [Paul H.] O'Neill that it was unfair to ask these&#13;
countries to pay back over the course of 40 years. For God's sake, if you can't make an&#13;
investment effective within 40 years, then the whole concept of development is an illusion. And&#13;
in fact, the record was that they did repay; the repayment percentage came close to that of the&#13;
Grameen Bank. It was 96 percent until the HIPC [heavily indebted poor countries] debt relief&#13;
exercise started, which sort of generalized, in a fair way, the issue of whether you have too high&#13;
a debt burden. It's wrong to start off by giving grants. It's OK if there proves to be a huge&#13;
problem in retrospect with the millstone hanging around your neck, then to take a measure, but it&#13;
creates a major moral hazard for the provider of the money and for the recipient to have a large&#13;
element of grants in the system.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What are the ramifications for the Bank per se?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Well, IDA, of course, needs to try and achieve additional amounts in the replenishment&#13;
pledges, preferably in advance for the future. Politically, thatâ&#128;&#153;s highly improbable, and itâ&#128;&#153;ll have&#13;
to be played by ear in each replenishment, but thereâ&#128;&#153;s a real risk that ultimately it might lead to a&#13;
reduction in total assistance to the developing countries. IDA was fast on the way to becoming&#13;
self-sustaining, as you may know, through the reflows and the charges, and that is now being&#13;
delayed ad infinitum. I sometimes wonder even whether the U.S. position was governed by the&#13;
desire to micromanage IDA.&#13;
&#13;
Q: The role of IDA Deputies has been criticized as aggressive in injecting donorsâ&#128;&#153; policy views&#13;
into IDA replenishment exercises. What is your opinion, and how does this affect the Board?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Well, there is sensitivity here. As a former IDA Deputy myself, I do think the process is&#13;
quite careful. There are a lot of sensible, idealistic people among the Deputies who are really&#13;
interested in development assistance. So I wouldn't just lash out at the Deputies, but there is a&#13;
tendency, which you might expect, of a number of specialists among each other to perfect the&#13;
system to the point where you get diminishing returns. So an attempt has been made to reduce&#13;
that risk by having the borrowing countries, IDA members, some of them representing regions,&#13;
come in as observers with the right to speak. But further work may be needed in that respect.&#13;
There's also some tension between the Deputies as a group and a feeling in the Board as a more&#13;
general group containing the borrowers that IDA may be claiming too much for itself and that&#13;
the Board should not just lie back, certainly not on country assistance programs and on&#13;
conditionality.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In 1995, in his first address to the Annual Meetings, President Wolfensohn emphasized the&#13;
revival of the Development Committee as a forum for substantive discussions between ministers&#13;
from both developed and developing countries. In your view, how has this revival impacted the&#13;
so-called North/South dialogue?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: In my view, the Development Committee is functioning much better than I remember&#13;
from those early days. It is useful to get a political input based on careful preparation by&#13;
Management, after and with Board approval, of the documents. It is useful to have a political&#13;
dialogue in order to create an honest awareness of fundamental issues in the capitals. If you don't&#13;
have that, the Bank becomes too separate and is at risk of not being fully understood in capitals.&#13;
But if these Finance and Development Ministers are involved closely twice a year, then that is&#13;
very helpful for the institution, and it provides good political input to what we need to do. We&#13;
cannot pretend to be solely a technocratic institution that does its technocratic best and then&#13;
applies screwdrivers where screws are loose. So I'm quite happy with the Development&#13;
Committee.&#13;
&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;m less happy with the tendency weâ&#128;&#153;ve been seeing lately to have joint sessions with the Interim&#13;
Committee. I have a feeling that that dilutes the effectiveness of the Development Committee&#13;
itself, because, obviously, major issues, the crisis-type issues that are frequently discussed in the&#13;
IMF, may dominate the attention of those who attend the joint meetings.&#13;
&#13;
Q: You might've begun to address the second question here, but how effective is the role of the&#13;
Development Committee as one of the bodies through which governors convey policy guidelines&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
to the Board and Management in moving forward the implementation agenda towards meeting&#13;
the MDG's [Millennium Development Goals] to reduce poverty?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: I was alluding to that already, but let me just say a bit more precisely on the&#13;
North/South issue that I do believe the meeting of senior officials, from borrowing and non-&#13;
borrowing countries, is important. They do tend to listen carefully to each other, that is my&#13;
impression, and I've attended many of these meetings. The MDGs, of course, are important as a&#13;
politically setting a goal, and they've created significant focus and cohesion in the international&#13;
approach to what needs to be done. The Development Committee is an important body in this&#13;
process, particularly because of the involvement of the Finance Ministers who, after all, have the&#13;
power of the purse; otherwise, one tends to have gatherings where foreign ministers and&#13;
development ministers may say more than they can really vouchsafe in the longer run. It's also&#13;
very important that the Development Committee retains its own degree of control over the&#13;
process and does not give this up to outside bodies, because what one might see then is that&#13;
Finance Ministers simply don't easily take orders from others, and then the effectiveness of the&#13;
process is reduced.&#13;
&#13;
Q: For the better part of the Bank's history, Board/Management relations were fraught with&#13;
built-in tension. How would you characterize these relations today, and how do you see them&#13;
evolving?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: When I came, there was quite a lot of tension. Mr. Wolfensohn was not too happy with&#13;
the Board, and the Board was not too happy with him, particularly when he got excited. As you&#13;
will have heard from colleagues, he was used to having a Board that was a partner in doing&#13;
business, and he was quite surprised to find these political characters following instructions and&#13;
not displaying all that much understanding of what he was trying to do. Nor were they always&#13;
impressed, either. After the fundamental discussion--which I mentioned earlier--about candor&#13;
and wearing two hats and being able to wear the Bank hat, I think there has been a major&#13;
improvement, also because the Comprehensive Development Framework created a focus for&#13;
Management and the Board to collaborate more easily within more or less the same framework&#13;
for addressing the issues.&#13;
&#13;
So I've become an enthusiast for the Comprehensive Development Framework. It has this&#13;
medium-term focus; it is holistic, to use the fad word; and the issues are interconnected, so it is a&#13;
good framework; and it brings out the need for country ownership, which is something to work&#13;
on. Even in Part One countries one can question whether there is ownership of the policies, so&#13;
that it's very important when there are major challenges to try and create a base within a country,&#13;
within successive governments, because you're following the effects over the medium-term. You&#13;
create continuity in the approach and in dealing with the challenges, and you need, of course, to&#13;
have participation to create a broader base for support in the population, and you need the&#13;
partners to work together. So it's an excellent framework and has all the columns from which you&#13;
need to select what the priorities are in a country that may need further attention. It's the right&#13;
idea that you need to force a Country Director into establishing together with the government the&#13;
real priorities as seen by the country itself. The CDF has helped in establishing better&#13;
Board/Management relations.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 The other essential factor is that Management has started managing. It was a tremendous&#13;
surprise to find how little professional management there was. The Bank was run like a public&#13;
sector body, almost, rather than a business. In retrospect, it's strange that this has taken so long,&#13;
but although history is very interesting, as a policymaker I'm also interested in looking forward. I&#13;
think we can have reasonable confidence that the Bank will not give up managing again.&#13;
&#13;
Q: We've talked about the resident full-time Board already. Do you wish to add further on how&#13;
it affects Board/Management relations?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: If the Board is constructive in its approach to the Bank, then it's helpful. If the Board is&#13;
not constructive, it's an irritant. Management is right at times to show its irritation, and the Board&#13;
is right at times to demand that Management be frank and explain the issues as it really sees&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
Q: To what extent does the dual role of the President as head of Management and as ex-officio&#13;
Chairman of the Board affect these Board/Management relations?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: I've sometimes tried to think of the alternative, and I think a Chairman from the Board&#13;
as a counterpart to the CEO [chief executive officer] would be a lot worse for&#13;
Board/Management relations. Given the political nature of the appointees in the Board--and it&#13;
cannot be denied that these are political appointments and not purely technocratic appointments,&#13;
in many cases--it is on balance useful that Management has the extra tool of having the&#13;
Chairman in the Board with a measure of control and with the ability to help set the agenda&#13;
through Management proposals for the agenda, which is then discussed in the Board. These extra&#13;
tools are necessary to strengthen Management sufficiently against situations that might occur of&#13;
arbitrary politics taking over.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How would you characterize the function of the Corporate Secretariat in its role as key&#13;
interlocutor between the Board and Management?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: It's an essential function, but it depends on the person who takes up that function. It&#13;
should be fulfilled with an understanding of the need for trust on both sides. Management needs&#13;
to confide in the Vice-President Secretary, and the Vice-President Secretary needs to be trusted&#13;
by the Board in order to convey the true issues as seen by the Board to Management and needs to&#13;
confide in the Board to the extent that that is possible. There have been some very good Vice-&#13;
President Secretaries, and there have been weaker ones.&#13;
&#13;
What you do not want is a Vice-President Secretary who is thinking all the time of making a&#13;
future career in a different vice-presidency within Management or becoming a Managing&#13;
Director. In the concrete case where the latter happened, the Vice-President Secretary had&#13;
fulfilled his role excellently. One did notice that when he tried to combine that with being a&#13;
Managing Director, the burden became intolerably heavy, and this was not a matter of the person&#13;
not being able to be confided in by either party, but it was a case of simply being overburdened.&#13;
It is a very separate function that demands your full attention, and it requires great care to select&#13;
a suitable person.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Q: How well do staff, in your opinion, understand the work of the Board?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: That differs enormously. It's hard to generalize. Staff members who have interacted&#13;
with the Board a lot understand it quite well. Many others are highly surprised to discover that&#13;
members of the Board are reasonable human beings with an interest in development like they&#13;
have. It was quite disconcerting to find in a panel session in the Executive Development Program&#13;
that many staff participants had only the vaguest understanding of our role.&#13;
&#13;
Q: And is that something the Corporate Secretariat should pursue?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: That's a good thought.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What, in your opinion, should be the Board's role in the selection of senior management?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Well, for certain positions, the Board's role should be very prominent: for the Director&#13;
General Operations Evaluation, obviously; also for the members of the Inspection Panel. I&#13;
chaired both recent selection processes. For the Legal Department, the succession is not just a&#13;
standard Management appointment. There, the President and top management should take care to&#13;
sound the Board very carefully, because the Legal Counsel is the counsel also of the Board and is&#13;
even the counsel of the Inspection Panel. This needs to be dealt with more carefully than in the&#13;
past. The Vice-President and Secretary we just discussed. The role of the Board should be&#13;
significant. There should be consultation with the whole Board individually and the Dean should&#13;
play a major role.&#13;
&#13;
One of the weaknesses in the structure--reverting to an earlier question, by the way--is that the&#13;
Dean happens to be selected by length of tenure in the Board and not by quality of service. At the&#13;
same time, it's not easy to solve, because if you start making the Dean a selection process, it&#13;
could become politicized. I don't know how to solve that.&#13;
&#13;
May I revert to the earlier question about weaknesses in structure?&#13;
&#13;
Q: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
STEK: One of the big issues is, of course, whether the President should be a U.S. citizen or&#13;
not. I have mixed feelings there. Many of my colleagues feel that this is shameful. At the same&#13;
time, my experience of global selection processes is that they become highly politicized and that&#13;
one may, due to totally wrong kinds of incentives which have the nature of bribery almost in&#13;
political terms, get an appalling choice. And, if it's a pure U.S. selection process with another&#13;
institution being in the hands of another group of countries--and there are not only two&#13;
institutions, there are more institutions, the WTO [World Trade Organization], et cetera--then&#13;
there are some advantages in having the process limited to a selection within one country which&#13;
happens to be the major shareholder. It also has the advantage that this might retain the support&#13;
more easily of that major shareholder. It does require that the major shareholder accept a profile&#13;
of the function made by the Board, and we've worked on that. There is now a paper on that; are&#13;
you aware of it?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Q: The joint IMF/World Bank report on the selection process of the Heads of the World Bank&#13;
and IMF?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Yes. It is important that the U.S. ED brings that report to the attention, in a timely&#13;
fashion, of the U.S. authorities, and that it is abided by, that it's taken seriously. As I said, I'm not&#13;
convinced that opening up globally would necessarily lead to better results. But it's very hard to&#13;
find the philosopher's stone here.&#13;
&#13;
Q: But how much of a role would the Board have in the selection of the WB President?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: A strong role would be good. If I recall, in that selection process there would be&#13;
interviews with a group from the Board. And then the question is, where do the rules become an&#13;
illusion, and where are they real? And that needs to be tested.&#13;
&#13;
Q: The candidate for President is normally selected by the U.S. government, then put forth to&#13;
the Board by the U.S. ED where the Board votes on it. Correct?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Now, the question is: will the Board have more of an active role in the selection process?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: There may be a possibility of examining a candidate in greater depth. I doubt whether&#13;
it's realistic to have a couple of candidates appear before the full Board because of the issues of&#13;
confidentiality and pressure from other countries. I don't trust the process enough for that. But I&#13;
think it's essential that the U.S. authorities take the needs of the institution very, very seriously&#13;
and do not take a blindly biased partisan approach to this issue. One of the difficulties with this&#13;
terrific democracy, of course, is that it's so highly polarized, so you don't get very often a&#13;
position of convergence towards the center without large disparities in view.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In your view, how successful is the Board in its attempts to bring some focus into the&#13;
activities of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: If there is an important point of view in the Board, Management does listen carefully.&#13;
Now, I'm not talking about the importance of a shareholder, but about an interesting view shared&#13;
by a number of Board members. Management does respond, and it does lead to change when&#13;
necessary. For example, the Board pressure to achieve selectivity, in the sense of not&#13;
fragmenting the efforts over too many fields, has been a significant factor in making&#13;
Management agree that greater selectiveness within the Comprehensive Development&#13;
Framework is needed. When the debate is still ongoing, Management does what it wants to do.&#13;
But when the debate has been resolved in a certain direction, Management tends to do what the&#13;
Board wants.&#13;

                                       Washington, D.C.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Good morning. Today is Friday, November 15th. We're resuming our interview with the&#13;
retiring Dutch ED, Mr. Pieter Stek. I'm Marie Zenni, Task Manager of the Bank's Oral History&#13;
Program, and with me is Professor Becker from the Business History Group. Further to&#13;
yesterday's question about whether there are constitutional or institutional factors limiting the&#13;
effectiveness of the Board function, I know you have further comments you wish to make. Please&#13;
go ahead.&#13;
&#13;
STEK: That's right. Good morning. One of the threats to the effectiveness of the institution as a&#13;
whole is the existence of outside groups who achieve their agreements among themselves before&#13;
things really come to the Board. The biggest threat, of course, is the G7, where the deals are&#13;
made in totally separate meetings and where attempts have been undertaken to have an impact on&#13;
the way Management and the Board do their business. We still get the occasional note or paper&#13;
with views on how the Bank should operate, and they are based on a compromise.&#13;
&#13;
One of the examples that I heard informally is that the U.S., as you may know, has been pressing&#13;
for a more flexible pricing system for the Bank's products, and particularly a higher level of&#13;
prices. The U.K. has opposed that. But at some point the U.K. offered the Americans to accept&#13;
what they wanted on prices and join them if the U.S. stopped bashing the idea of adjustment&#13;
lending. Now, that's the kind of deal you don't want to see made outside the Bank; you want to&#13;
have that in an open discussion in the Board and not have the U.K. being quiet when the U.S.&#13;
fulminates against the prices that we employ, and the U.S. keeping quiet when the Brits talk&#13;
about adjustment and how necessary and good it is to have programmatic lending. That is one of&#13;
the real threats to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Another example: one sees that the present Chairman of the Development Committee has&#13;
organized a meeting of the deputies of the Development Committee in Paris, manned to a&#13;
significant extent by people from the capitals, and intended also to give guidance to the Bank.&#13;
Now, that would undermine the role of the Board, if it became institutionalized. One of the&#13;
things we are going to have to try is to recapture the initiative and prevent this poisonous plant&#13;
from blooming.&#13;
&#13;
More generally, I find each grouping that tries to achieve its aims by making deals outside the&#13;
Bank damaging to the Bank. As a counterpart to the G7, one has the G9, and it may be GI1 now;&#13;
I'm not quite sure how many have joined, but the developing countries also feel that they can&#13;
only achieve their aims if they resist some of the pressures. To my great relief, the European&#13;
Union is not very effective in the Bank, although they're trying. I get invited to meetings. I do go,&#13;
and I try to undermine them, because I'm not happy with these outside groupings.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Moving on to the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s business, how should the Bank address the issue of selectivity in&#13;
its crowded agenda, in light of greater emphasis on partnerships with borrowers, development&#13;
actors, and other aid agencies and organizations?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Yes, youâ&#128;&#153;re speaking of the kinds of selectivity related to what the Bank does itself, for&#13;
its range of products and instruments.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Right. I must admit that I'm not one of the greatest supporters of making this a huge&#13;
issue. Of course, there are UN organizations that cover certain fields that the Bank must not enter&#13;
into. UNDP [United Nations Development Program] does things in post-conflict countries at a&#13;
very early stage when the conflict is hardly over, and perhaps not over by some definitions, and&#13;
that is not the point where the Bank should come in and deal with emergency situations on the&#13;
ground. And the Bank is perhaps not the best-equipped in a number of areas which the Bank has&#13;
never addressed. So I'm not talking about that kind of selectivity, which should be maintained.&#13;
&#13;
We are not human rights specialists. That doesn't mean that human rights are unimportant, but&#13;
we need not provide all the expertise, quite apart from the question of whether the Articles would&#13;
allow us to deal with the issue of human rights, which is an open question. One can argue that&#13;
the Bank has a role when human rights undermine its effectiveness and its reputation; however,&#13;
that does not mean that the Bank itself needs to do the work in that area. It may have to decide&#13;
how much and what kind of activity it undertakes in the country.&#13;
&#13;
If we concentrate the selectivity issue on the instruments used by development agencies, then&#13;
experience teaches that if the Bank focuses on something, it tends to do it rather well. If another&#13;
agency is at work somewhere, that may be a good reason for the Bank not to apply that&#13;
instrument there, but that does not mean that in some other part of the world the Bank does not&#13;
need the instrument, if the agency we're talking about is not at work there. This needs to be dealt&#13;
with on a case-by-case basis in cooperation with the other partners, with a reasoned debate about&#13;
who does what. That is the real challenge for the Bank, to be selective in that sense, to be willing&#13;
to talk about selectivity in particular instances, but not in the sense of limiting its arsenal&#13;
necessarily.&#13;
&#13;
By the way, after an explosion of the number of partnerships--a whole galaxy was added to what&#13;
the Bank was doing in partnership, due to the vision and the enthusiasm of President&#13;
Wolfensohn--in the last two years, a significant restoration of focus has taken place, so that we&#13;
now have the criteria in place for what partnerships to enter into and how to exit from them when&#13;
they do not meet the criteria. So by now the Bank is reasonably well organized in that respect.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Well, having served as chair of the Committee on Development Effectiveness (CODE) for&#13;
the past two years, in your opinion how adequate are the Bank's various mechanisms for&#13;
evaluating and measuring the results of its work?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: It's a good question, itâ&#128;&#153;s an important question, because there have been a lot of outside&#13;
comments on the independence of the Bank's evaluation. In my view, those comments were&#13;
largely based on ignorance, or they came from people with axes to grind, or were based on&#13;
ideology. I think the Bank is very effective in evaluating its own work, because OED&#13;
[Operations Evaluation Department] and its head, the Director General, Operations Evaluation,&#13;
have sufficient safeguards for the right kind of independence. The performance of that&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
department has been very good. The CODE discussions have quality to a significant extent&#13;
because of the input from OED, which is very critical and very open. OED does talk with&#13;
Management about its products while drafting them, but that has not undermined the candor of&#13;
the reports. It's a close relationship. The danger of stressing the need for absolute independence&#13;
is that you lose the contact between Management and OED and get a more distant view of what&#13;
the Bank does, with significant possible misunderstandings, like you get from a GAO [General&#13;
Accounting Office] in America or a Court of Accounts in many other countries. Often their&#13;
judgments are based on lack of understanding of the policy issues involved. In my opinion, it is&#13;
essential that OED stays in the Bank with the present safeguards for its independence and not be&#13;
made more distant; otherwise, a very valuable interactive relationship leading to better results for&#13;
the Bank would be lost, and it would become a much more adversarial relationship, which would&#13;
be stupid. As it is, the Board often sides with OED. Management is in a position where it quite&#13;
often has to defend itself, explaining why it differs in some respects from OED. Then a&#13;
constructive dialogue--or trialogue--takes place. In my view, the Bank has a strong institutional&#13;
setup.&#13;
&#13;
Moreover, OED is not the only source of independent evaluation. Thanks to OED and the Board,&#13;
Management felt the need to create QAG (Quality Assurance Group). Although it reports to&#13;
Management, it has proved to be highly independent and effective. And we have the Inspection&#13;
Panel to help Management correct the mistakes that may have occurred in the course of its&#13;
activities in countries, when there are complaints from outsiders. On the whole, there is quite an&#13;
elaborate and carefully thought out system of checks and balances in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The challenge has been for Management to realize that criticism is not necessarily damaging to&#13;
the Institution. In fact, criticism is very wholesome, is very good for the institution because it&#13;
leads to improvement, and certainly in the cases where people have been affected, Management&#13;
itself should be happy that it can remedy situations that have arisen. I have witnessed a&#13;
significant maturing of the attitude of Management in the last few years, particularly after the&#13;
unpleasant incident with the Western China Poverty Reduction case. I believe Management has&#13;
done some soul-searching and has realized that it's not the right approach to try and keep things&#13;
in the dark. This has given a major incentive to improve risk management. What became clear&#13;
from some of the major mishaps was that risk was not managed ex ante. There was no discussion&#13;
at the top level of very risky projects, and then when something went badly wrong there was fury&#13;
at the top, but in fact the institutional mechanisms were not there that forced the lower level to&#13;
report to Management about what they intended to do and to think carefully about not only the&#13;
benefits but the possible costs if things went badly wrong.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. Do you wish to add anything more on this? Following through on this--and you've&#13;
already talked about it--in view of the fact that both OED in its evaluative function and the&#13;
Inspection Panel as a fact-finding body both report directly to the Board, how do these two&#13;
independently set up bodies affect Board relations with Management?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Yes. We have been trying to achieve, particularly with the Inspection Panel, that they&#13;
have a more regular interaction with the Board and with Management. I've organized sessions,&#13;
lunches or teas. Now the corporate secretariat has the task of organizing--twice a year, I think, is&#13;
the agreement--a briefing for the Board. And I try to get Management to remember to put the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Inspection Panel on the list for distribution of documents and to invite them to sessions that are&#13;
important for them. We need to continue working on that, to institutionalize it. It's very&#13;
important that they are not regarded as a body foreign to the institution. They are part of the&#13;
institution, too.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What should the Board look for in selecting the leaders of these two bodies (Inspection&#13;
Panel and Operations Evaluation Department)?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Well, in my view, the right kind of personality is a person who is independent but not&#13;
adversarial, a person who cannot be intimidated and who is able to inspire his people not to be&#13;
intimidated. The point is not that these people should be brought in from the outside. There are&#13;
significant risks, as a matter of fact, in bringing in outsiders, because it may take them too long&#13;
to understand the Bank, which is a complicated place. That doesn't mean you should not have&#13;
outsiders, but you should be very careful in weighing the advantages and disadvantages. The&#13;
example of Bob [Robert] Picciotto as the DGO [Director General, Operations Evaluation] is a&#13;
clear example of somebody who had had no education in evaluation but was extremely&#13;
knowledgeable about the Bank, very intelligent and very independent and able to take hits&#13;
without cowering.&#13;
&#13;
OED has a significant number of very good people whose analytical capacities are strong; many&#13;
of them have come internally from the Bank, some of the outsiders are also very good. You want&#13;
a mix of outsiders and insiders. An example of a good outsider is Catherine Gwin, whom we&#13;
attracted after the ODC [Overseas Development Council] collapsed. That was a strong American&#13;
think-tank on development issues, and I'm sorry it collapsed, but at least we acquired her. As you&#13;
may know, she did a very good job on the IDA evaluation. So you need good outsiders and&#13;
insiders so that they can cross-fertilize, as it were. Even though the levels below the DGO&#13;
himself are allowed to go back into operational staff, this does not undermine independence.&#13;
That's not my experience, anyway, going by what they write. Ultimately, the only way to gain&#13;
the respect of Management is to do your job well, and the good people in OED can get back into&#13;
the operational staff in responsible positions.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What do you think of the systematic learning of lessons in the Bank as an input in policy&#13;
formulation? What does the Bank learn from OED's evaluations, the Inspection Panel findings,&#13;
QAG?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: The interaction with OPCS [Operations Policy and Country Services] is very&#13;
constructive when OPCS has a good vice-president. I thought Joanne Salop worked very well&#13;
with OED, had a full understanding. You do need somebody who has an interest in improving&#13;
the products of the Bank, and I think Jim [James W.] Adams is also looking at this in a&#13;
constructive way.&#13;
&#13;
I believe that the desire to learn is quite strong. That desire arose when the Wapenhans report had&#13;
come out. It was clear that a lot needed to be learned and that the Bank was inflicting wounds on&#13;
itself by not performing as well as it should. That has brought internal learning into the forefront&#13;
of the agenda, so I'm reasonably happy about that.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Also, the integration of WBI [World Bank institute]--the former EDI [Economic Development&#13;
Institute]--into the operations of the Bank is important. It used to be a sort of separate planet, and&#13;
it no longer is. Further work still needs to be done, and with Frannie Leautier as the Vice-&#13;
President, I'm sure that progress will be made.&#13;
&#13;
Learning is also promoted by the discussions in the Board. The Board has an open eye for the&#13;
need for that, and stresses it quite often, so I'm not dissatisfied with the incentives.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Is there a culture of learning in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: There is a reasonable culture of learning, let's put it that way. There are also constraints.&#13;
I mean, budgets and time are scarce, and I think the major internal problems of the rapidity of&#13;
reform, or lack of it, are due to budgetary and time constraints. There are also personnel&#13;
constraints; in the area of human resources, there are weaknesses which are hard to handle.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How do you see the evolving issue of the Bank's policy on disclosure of information, and&#13;
how is this viewed by both borrowing and non-borrowing countries?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Well, the Bank has become a lot more open in my time. It's quite far advanced, as a&#13;
matter of fact. I think the clamor in the outside world for complete transparency is misguided,&#13;
because, after all, that might lead to politicization of the debates, and that would be a terrible&#13;
result. The confidentiality of Board deliberations is essential, and I can understand that&#13;
Management at the early stages of its decision-making does not want to bring out its internal&#13;
debates. But the documents themselves are about issues of public policy, so the outside world is&#13;
right to ask for timely information and disclosure.&#13;
&#13;
In IFC [International Finance Corporation] there are separate problems, of course, of corporate&#13;
proprietorship or proprietary information. And they need to be addressed very carefully, but I&#13;
think there too progress has been made, and will continue to be made. We just had a case on&#13;
Chad/Cameroon where it was found that it would be possible to give some of the information&#13;
about the contracts and the analysis that led up to the contracts, without damaging anybody.&#13;
&#13;
We are moving in the right direction, and by now we're reasonably transparent. There may be&#13;
some more distance to go. The borrowing countries sometimes have difficulty with it because&#13;
they are not always at a stage themselves where their own internal proceedings are transparent to&#13;
the public, so there may be a difference of attitude. But the Bank cannot escape from the issue&#13;
and needs to discuss this with the borrowing countries and make it clear to them that it even&#13;
could be to their advantage if they are more transparent themselves.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. Would you say that the opening up of the Bank was inevitable due to (a) the advent of&#13;
technology, (b) pressures from NGO's, (c) the man at the helm, or perhaps a combination of all&#13;
three factors? What, in your opinion, can be attributed the most to the opening up of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: The man at the helm is very outspoken and forceful and has given major incentives to&#13;
the institution. It would be a waste if you didn't use that to make yourself more accepted in the&#13;
outside world. On a parallel track, it's very sensible to be more open if you're reasonably satisfied&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
that you're performing well. There's always the suspicion if you're not disclosing that there might&#13;
be something to hide. It's as simple as that. And we don't have all that much to hide.&#13;
&#13;
What were the other two?&#13;
&#13;
Q: The advent of technology.&#13;
&#13;
STEK: That, of course, has played a major role. A major difficulty, still, is the language&#13;
question, as you may have heard from some of my colleagues. They like disclosure, but they&#13;
think disclosure is not all that effective if it's in languages that are not understood in places where&#13;
the disclosure might be useful. There is a real question here, whether there shouldn't be more&#13;
budget for translation.&#13;
&#13;
And what was the third?&#13;
&#13;
Q: The third is pressure from NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Theyâ&#128;&#153;ve played a useful role, although they go to extremes in what they ask, but we can&#13;
deal with NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What in the implementation of the CDF principles do you see as most effective in the Bank's&#13;
renewed commitment to fighting poverty and in helping the international community meet the&#13;
Millennium Development Goals?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: I would say the stress on the need for ownership and the stress on the need for&#13;
selectivity between all the potential activities that could be undertaken in a country. The latter&#13;
part still needs to be stressed all the time. The four institutional columns, and particularly three of&#13;
them, are extremely important as priorities that need to be addressed in many countries, and they&#13;
are a condition for the other activities to be successful. That was brought out already at the&#13;
analytical level in David Dollarâ&#128;&#153;s works, which provide persuasive evidence that countries that&#13;
are not willing and are not able almost by definition do not do well, but itâ&#128;&#153;s good to see that&#13;
statistics prove that. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s made the Bank focus much more on the framework within which&#13;
activities can be successful, and it's made the Bank also realize that once you have created that&#13;
framework, you might as well give programmatic loans because the country by that time has&#13;
acquired a structure that enables it to deal reasonably sensibly with these loans.&#13;
&#13;
Let's never forget that it's not perfect in the non-borrowing countries either. There's always this&#13;
tendency to look at the imperfections, but you should compare the imperfections with a level of&#13;
imperfection that exists in the Part One countries, too. The CDF has been extremely helpful in&#13;
stressing ownership and selectivity. The participation and partnership items in the CDF are&#13;
important, but somewhat less so. Ownership is very difficult, of course, both to measure--&#13;
although OED has its ideas about that--and it's also difficult from the point of view of attribution&#13;
of responsibility, once you say it's not the Bank but it's the country, or it's not the partners but it's&#13;
the country itself that has responsibility for the performance to a significant extent. So you have&#13;
some challenges there of attribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            Pieter Stek&#13;
                               November 14 and 15, 2002 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
However, the real challenge for the Bank is to believe in ownership itself. That means that,&#13;
before shoveling out the money, it should continue the dialogue on essential points until it really&#13;
believes that the country understands what the issue is about and really regards something as a&#13;
priority; otherwise, if it's not to be too facile in the approach to the dialogue, there is a danger&#13;
here from decentralization, which is not fully realized. Decentralization was necessary because&#13;
of the client orientation that we're trying to achieve, and it's an element in bringing about&#13;
ownership, but also an element of challenge for the Bank because a decentralized Country&#13;
Director may be too accommodating at a certain point and the Bank may lose consistency in its&#13;
approach across the various countries. In my view, it's essential that decentralization be&#13;
accompanied by controls on quality from the center, and I'm not quite sure that that is fully the&#13;
case yet.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, one of the problems of the Bank is the complaints about its slowness, implying&#13;
a high cost of business for things to ripen before really doing something. However, my&#13;
experience is that the countries themselves are often to blame for delays, but there are also&#13;
problems of Bank procedure which make the whole process rather laborious. Empowering the&#13;
local person to do a lot is very good as long as the controls are in place in the center and applying&#13;
the controls does not take too much time.&#13;
&#13;
One of the more successful Country Directors from my group, with difficult countries, stayed in&#13;
Washington but empowered the Country Manager (who used to be called the Res. Rep. [resident&#13;
representative]) to do basically almost everything, but insisted, of course, on being briefed online&#13;
about what was going on. That, in my view, is possibly a better structure even than&#13;
decentralizing all these Country Directors to the field. Because the Vice-Presidents are&#13;
overburdened, they cannot deal with everything at the center, and the anchors who deal with&#13;
countries and are meant to establish the link between the countries and the center are also&#13;
overburdened. Now, it's not quite clear whether this is because of the impossibility of dealing&#13;
with a lot of countries or whether it's because they're not senior enough. There are also budgetary&#13;
issues here, and there are various ways of approaching this, but I have a feeling that the optimum&#13;
has not yet been reached. It's much better than it used to be, but these challenges to the&#13;
effectiveness of the Bank still exist.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How well has decentralization worked in bringing the Bank closer to its clients, and how&#13;
effective is it in promoting greater policy dialogue, in view of the fact that the Bank has greatly&#13;
decentralized since the strategic compact in 1997, where a third of the total workforce is in the&#13;
field?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: In my view, this needs to be evaluated. It's very hard, offhand, to give a judgment about&#13;
which one can be confident. I have the impression that Country Directors in the field tend to do a&#13;
good job. They're committed and hard-working. But I do have a sense that the center loses too&#13;
much influence and that the cost/benefit relationship has not been looked at very carefully. I&#13;
don't think the study on decentralization by Management took into account the cost side&#13;
adequately. It was more an advocacy than an analytical document.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Q: How would you assess the Bank's various instruments in improving client engagement: CAS&#13;
(Country Assistance Strategy), PRSP (Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper), and HIPC (Heavily&#13;
Indebted Poor Countries)?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: They are good instruments. I mean, the CAS and the PRSPs are essential. The CAS is,&#13;
of course, the Bank's business plan, although originally it was a sort of hybrid when it was not&#13;
yet clear whether the country could have a separate view or whether it had to be integrated into&#13;
the CAS, into the dialogue. But as soon as the CDF came out and the PRSPs developed, it&#13;
became clear that you could have two different documents, a country priority document and a&#13;
Bank business plan. In middle-income countries, of course, you normally have an economic&#13;
program of the government within a budgetary framework. Similarly, the PRSP is a country-&#13;
owned document--or is meant to be--with all the challenges around that. But the CAS is the Bank&#13;
document, and that's a good structure. We try to have a similar mental framework, without the&#13;
detailed monitoring, for middle-income countries.&#13;
&#13;
The HIPCs are separate. They, of course, do have their PRSPs, and they have been forced into&#13;
thinking about their situation very carefully due to the difficult circumstances in which they find&#13;
themselves. But the Bank itself, and the shareholders particularly, have been arguing for a long&#13;
time about the degree of detail, of conditionality to apply to the HIPC countries. We have the&#13;
micromanagers like the U.S., who want them to follow instructions almost on raising their&#13;
expenditures in certain fields, with a certain tendency from that side to ignore the larger picture,&#13;
and the other countries that want public-expenditure management to be at the heart of the&#13;
reforms of such a country, in principle leading to adequate budgets for education and health and&#13;
social protection within the broader framework of all the prioritizations that need to take place in&#13;
a country. Those are two very different approaches to these countries, and that's a debate&#13;
between shareholders in the Board.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. On the importance of insulating the Bank's lending decisions from politics and&#13;
ideology, while it is widely thought that the Bank is excessively influenced by the G7 and in&#13;
particular the U.S., in your opinion, how well-defined is the Bank's role on good governance?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: I think there are two issues here. Yesterday we spoke about my experience of politics in&#13;
the Bank. At the more general level, I think one does encounter pressures to be too generous to&#13;
countries, not to be selective enough when countries are in fashion, and it is damaging to the&#13;
reputation of the Bank when, in retrospect, it proves that you've been too generous and that the&#13;
money is not all that effective. But there are also the much more conspicuous cases of&#13;
politicization, where a country gets excluded. I mentioned my personal experience with Croatia;&#13;
it got frozen out for a while, and there are other cases too. But these are all at variance, both&#13;
giving too much and giving too little, both are at variance with the principle of equal treatment,&#13;
of non-discrimination, which is enshrined in the Articles. These are insidious threats to the Bank,&#13;
and yet the political pressures are so great at times that the freezing out of countries does happen,&#13;
which, looked at purely from the point of view of the Articles, is not acceptable, unless, as a&#13;
specialized agency of the United Nations, we ourselves have to abide by a resolution of the&#13;
United Nations or a decision of the Security Council.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We already talked about pressure groups outside the Bank, and the G7 is one of those. As I also&#13;
said yesterday, thank heavens they frequently disagree. But the U.S. does sometimes try to&#13;
browbeat the others into following certain patterns of behavior. That is a problem. There is a&#13;
power relationship here which is simply very strong, and other instruments may be brought into&#13;
play in the debates outside which are not instruments that you would learn about openly. I mean,&#13;
that's familiar in politics, the mixing up of issues which should not be mixed up, like the sale of&#13;
planes, if you want to achieve optimal, undistorted outcomes for what the Bank is doing.&#13;
&#13;
Also, good governance is extraordinarily important for the effectiveness of what the Bank does. I&#13;
already spoke about David Dollar and his colleagues. I also spoke about the institutional columns&#13;
of the legal and judicial framework. In all my borrowing countries there are problems with the&#13;
legal and judicial framework. Many of them also have inadequate financial sectors, which is also&#13;
a column, and the acceptance and the cohesion of a society, which is very often a determinant of&#13;
the outcomes for such a country, is related to the social protection column. Good governance, as&#13;
you use it here, is shorthand for corruption. While I think that it should be used in a wider sense&#13;
including corruption, it's a good thing that Jim Wolfensohn has brought corruption itself onto the&#13;
agenda, a very good thing. It's extraordinarily important. It's hard to handle, but it needs to be&#13;
discussed frankly, and it should be an element of the selectivity of the Bank between countries,&#13;
whether the governance in the sense of corruption is undermining the way a dollar is spent. A&#13;
dollar that goes to some outside account is obviously not a useful dollar.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank's formal approach to this is very correct. First of all, the Bank has become much more&#13;
focused on internal monitoring of its projects, and that has proved to be highly necessary. The&#13;
astonishment Wolfensohn voiced on arriving in the Bank and hearing that corruption did not&#13;
exist in the Bank is well-known. It has proved necessary to examine ourselves very carefully,&#13;
and it's good that we find cases and to pursue them and prosecute the culprits, if you can find&#13;
them. The next level is the countries, and if we're wasting our money there, even though the&#13;
project itself may be fine, then we shouldn't make too much of an effort in such a country, except&#13;
to try and educate them. And if there's total unwillingness, you should not work in a country. All&#13;
in all, the Bank's policy has improved enormously in this respect.&#13;
&#13;
Q: You might have touched on the next question, but I'll ask it anyway. In view of the&#13;
importance of legislative oversight of the executive branch for government transparency and&#13;
accountability, the Bank is increasingly supporting work to strengthen legislatures and develop&#13;
them as institutions. What is your assessment of these efforts?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Well, we recently got some brochures, booklets, from the Legal Department. One of the&#13;
issues in the Bank is whether the Legal Department should have an operational function, whether&#13;
that would not imply a lack of separation of functions that would be inappropriate. Anyway, at&#13;
the moment, they do this work, and I've asked for a Board discussion of this, and it's taken some&#13;
time for it to come on the agenda. It's not happened in my time. I've been asking for this because&#13;
it's obviously necessary to evaluate carefully whether we're doing a good job. It is also an area&#13;
where partnerships are important and where the Bank may not have the right number of people&#13;
and perhaps not even the right people to do this work at the best possible level. So I have to&#13;
abstain from venturing an opinion at the moment.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. What of the Dutch trust fund?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Clearly the Dutch government attaches importance to the issue, as the Bank itself does,&#13;
but also some Dutch universities, particularly Leiden, are involved in helping countries to create&#13;
a civil code that is up-to-date. I simply cannot judge how effective this has been.&#13;
&#13;
Just one more remark on the previous issue. I said that all my borrowing countries have problems&#13;
with it. I just want to say that it is my impression that with or without partners, it's taking very,&#13;
very long to solve them. I believe I can safely generalize from my countries to all borrowing&#13;
countries. It is totally essential to do a lot of hard work, and it is my impression that insufficient&#13;
funds and effort probably are still being devoted to that issue. Because the private sector cannot&#13;
flourish where there is a lousy judicial system, and if that is compounded by a bad legal system,&#13;
or the other way around, then the situation is even worse. And we need the private sector,&#13;
obviously, to start things up in a meaningful sense, because the Bank has rightly come to the&#13;
conclusion that its own efforts are very small relative to the size of the challenge, whether one&#13;
measures it by the Millennium Development Goals or in some other way. It needs to be done in&#13;
partnership, and it needs to be done particularly by catalyzing private-sector flows to difficult&#13;
countries and difficult sectors. If we don't work on this catalysis of private-sector money, we'll&#13;
not be successful. So my sense is that the challenge is still not being met.&#13;
&#13;
Q: The Bank, in its role as key broker in an increasingly interrelated and interconnected world,&#13;
has launched major initiatives to address a number of emerging challenges, including helping to&#13;
bridge the digital divide (e.g., Global Development Gateway, Global Development Network,&#13;
Distance Learning, et cetera). In your opinion, how effective is the Bank in its analytical and&#13;
advisory role, as evidenced from recipient countries and their policies?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: That's one of the areas of scaling up; the private sector helps to scale up; ownership&#13;
helps to scale up; knowledge dissemination helps to scale up in finding good practice at the&#13;
global level. The Development Gateway has major challenges because initially it was caught in a&#13;
bind between censorship and quality control. It didn't solve that issue. I'm not aware of the latest&#13;
situation, but there was a lot of trash on the Gateway. I remember the glee with which the Saudi&#13;
Director asked the U.S. Director whether she had looked at the U.S. page, which was loaded with&#13;
human rights abuses, according to people who had brought that into that page. I always regretted&#13;
that the Gateway was not made a better Gateway in the sense of saying, â&#128;&#156;Look here for this, look&#13;
there for that,â&#128;? and instead tried to accumulate all the individual items in its own database.&#13;
&#13;
Without quality control, I don't think that is the best way forward. Perhaps it's further advanced&#13;
at the moment--I lost interest a bit, although I know that Mr. Wolfensohn regards it as extremely&#13;
important. The potential is indeed enormous. The Global Development Network probably has&#13;
been more effective, although I'm speaking simply because of the presentations that we've had,&#13;
and I haven't checked with outside researchers, whether they really are happy about this network&#13;
or not. Distance-learning is also very important. It's being used a lot, including in my former&#13;
countries, and I think that it is really highly effective in making learning, science and best&#13;
practices available to people who otherwise could not afford it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: So, in sum, how effective is the Bank in its analytical and advisory roles, as evidenced from&#13;
the countries and their policies?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Well, the QAG and OED evaluations of technical assistance are reasonably positive,&#13;
but I think there's some way to go still. If I recall, the outcome is that there are still weaknesses,&#13;
particularly in screening what is made available and screening how it is used. The fact that it is&#13;
being screened and measured as well as possible is very important. I would say this is an ongoing&#13;
process of improvement. We've had major improvements already in the quality of projects, as&#13;
you know. Their satisfactoriness has improved enormously; however, there remain major&#13;
challenges for programmatic and adjustment loans. One has to measure their effectiveness,&#13;
which is highly dependent on the quality of analysis and the acceptance of analysis and advice.&#13;
These challenges have not yet been solved, but the work is ongoing in OED and in QAG.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In general, what is the feedback from recipient countries on the advice we give them?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: They are happy with the advice often, and while I'm not one of those who say that&#13;
prices need to be increased vastly for ordinary Bank products, I do think advice should not be for&#13;
nothing beyond the very basic stuff about how to audit yourself and that sort of thing. If you&#13;
don't pay for advice, it doesn't get owned. Then you say, â&#128;&#156;Oh, well, if you want to write about&#13;
that, go ahead!â&#128;? And then you put it in the bottom drawer of your desk. It has to be asked for and&#13;
paid for. As an economist, I think that is one of the better incentives to make people value what&#13;
they get.&#13;
&#13;
 I think the Bank itself has a problem in its quality. First of all, the Bank has lost a lot of good&#13;
people because of all the major changes in the Bank, where there was a sort of interaction&#13;
between all this change and the uncertainty about it and the seeming criticism of the past and the&#13;
move away from, letâ&#128;&#153;s say, pure engineering and economic technocrats to programs that were&#13;
more strongly based on client preferences. That has led to the shedding of a lot of quality from&#13;
the Bank in the technocratic sense. I don't think it's been made up for with the influx of young&#13;
people, and it was impossible for the remaining old guard to train these people rapidly enough.&#13;
The Bank has a real quality issue which it needs to pay attention to.&#13;
&#13;
The quality problem is also related to the budget. The fact that we have not had a capital increase&#13;
with a paid-in portion for a long time is constraining the budget a lot, because if you invest the&#13;
paid-in portion, you have more scope for increasing reserves, for provisioning, but also for&#13;
increasing the budget. This has been one of the most impossible issues to discuss with the U.S.&#13;
and some other G7 members. While they were rightly critical about the effectiveness of the Bank&#13;
five, six years ago, that time is over, and now we're being made less effective than we could be&#13;
by being starved of resources. And analysis and advice from inside the Bank are quite cost&#13;
effective because then you don't have to pay as much as for outside consultants, who often&#13;
charge outrageous rates.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What is your assessment of the Bank as purveyor of global public goods, e.g., CGIAR&#13;
[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research], GEF [Global Environment&#13;
Facility], et cetera?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Well, it's moved into this area, and it's absolutely the right thing to do. It is seeking how&#13;
to be effective in the field of health and knowledge transmission.&#13;
&#13;
And one of the most important ones we've moved back into is trade, of course; in fact, that's one&#13;
of the things that I personally take some pride in. Our chair has helped to bring trade back onto&#13;
the agenda. The Bank sadly allowed it to lapse, and lost a number of very good people who were&#13;
at work in DEC [Development Economics Vice Presidency], but we managed to increase the&#13;
budget about a year and a half ago, and now it is back on the agenda. The Bank is writing very&#13;
good stuff, and it's essential that the Bank deals with the issues between developing and&#13;
developed countries in a balanced way to try and influence the blinkered attitudes of many&#13;
countries, a number of very prominent countries particularly.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What is your assessment of the Bank's current strategy on the environment, increasingly&#13;
viewed as moving beyond safeguarding to improving the environment?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: This follows logically from the global public goods, of course; climate and biodiversity&#13;
are important elements. It's not quite clear whether the Bank itself should be a major player in&#13;
biodiversity, not because it's an unimportant product, but if it can be done well by others, it&#13;
should. But the Bank needs to be knowledgeable about biodiversity and know what to do in its&#13;
own projects that affect the environment. Our safeguard policies are very important in this&#13;
respect, forestry and environmental safeguards and what not. The Bank's strategy on the&#13;
environment has improved a lot.&#13;
&#13;
The strategy paper is an important one, moving towards mainstreaming of environmental&#13;
concerns in a significant sense where that is relevant. It has become clear that environment is not&#13;
a separate sector. It's a cross-cutting issue much more than a sector, so while the purely&#13;
environmental projects do have a right to exist, they are not the most important part of the&#13;
environmental program of the Bank. That is made very explicit in the environmental-strategy&#13;
paper, and the responsibilities are nowadays set out in strategy papers much better than in the&#13;
past. There are accountability frameworks, and there's been extra budgeting because the&#13;
monitoring aspect. The M &amp; E [monitoring and evaluation] aspects of much of what the Bank&#13;
has done were always weak, and they required budget. Even if you have the right principles, if&#13;
the task managers don't have enough budget to do it well, then you are nowhere. For the&#13;
environment, we now have a quality control unit. So I'm quite happy about the improvements in&#13;
effectiveness that have been achieved.&#13;
&#13;
Q: On the subject of aid coordination, President Wolfensohn has recently decried the terrible&#13;
management plaguing development aid, emphasizing that fragmentation of donors' efforts has&#13;
long hampered its effectiveness. How would you assess the Bank's various mechanisms in&#13;
coordinating and mobilizing aid resources through trust funds, consortia and consultative and aid&#13;
groups, especially in view of the decline of foreign aid?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: You can even make up by increased effectiveness to some extent for a decline in&#13;
foreign aid. The crucial point is that a lack of harmonization between donors makes life&#13;
impossible for many countries. You get the wrong kind of vested interest in the segmentation&#13;
between all these donor bodies. The Netherlands Ministry for Development Assistance through&#13;

                             November 14 and 15, 2002 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
my predecessor, Eveline Herfkens, when she became a minister, had this as a major item on the&#13;
agenda to try and improve coordination between donors in order to enhance effectiveness and&#13;
make life tolerable for the recipients. That's one of the reasons why the sector-wide approaches&#13;
have come to the fore in the agendas of some of the donor countries and the Bank is&#13;
collaborating with them experimentally in a number of countries and a number of sectors,&#13;
particularly education in Tanzania, if I remember correctly.&#13;
&#13;
The difficulties are that you need to have a coordinated approach across the whole spectrum of&#13;
documents that are required by all the donors. Everybody is supposed to be reasonable, but the&#13;
product needs to be acceptable in terms of one's own standards and criteria. All these countries&#13;
have their own Court of Accounts, the Bank has its own rules, and the Bank itself, it appears, is&#13;
one of the more rigid ones in these partnerships. I know that the European Union is not easy.&#13;
They are very legalistic, so there are big challenges, but they are being worked on. The work is&#13;
serious, and the pressure from donors like the Netherlands is very strong. All in all, we're moving&#13;
in the right direction, but at a rather slow pace.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What about on the institutional level within the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: I believe that at the highest level the Bank agrees that this should be done. Whether the&#13;
pressure is strong to proceed fast, I sometimes doubt that, but the work that is ongoing is serious.&#13;
I don't think the Bank is dragging its feet, but it's not making this a huge priority, let's put it that&#13;
way.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Well, in your opinion, how successful is the Bank in coordinating donor activities with its&#13;
partners: the UN, the IMF and others?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: The improvements have been enormous, of course, particularly with the IMF. Perhaps&#13;
this is also due to the fact that the IMF and the Bank were at risk if they didn't behave. They can&#13;
brilliantly present themselves as collaborating all the time, and of course real life is rather&#13;
different because personalities can clash. But the fact is that in the joint staff assessments of&#13;
PRSPs and in other efforts they do work together quite well, and of course the Concordat of&#13;
1989, drawn up after the Argentinean disaster in their relationship, has led to major&#13;
improvements. They do talk with each other all the time at the requisite levels. Still, in the field a&#13;
lot depends on personalities, as one can have difficult people on either side. That's why&#13;
collaboration needs to be a question of continuous management attention. My experience in my&#13;
countries is that there are still quite frequent glitches and lack of understanding. While I&#13;
originally was very much a Fund man, I do find the Fund rather overbearing in many cases, and&#13;
moving to its conclusion--often irreversible--about what should happen without taking sufficient&#13;
account of the deeper underlying structural issues which are important to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How about Bank coordination with the UN?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: That depends very much on the coordination in the field and at the highest level. It's&#13;
good because Mr. Wolfensohn and Mr. [Kofi] Annan get on well with each other. At the lower&#13;
levels, it's less easy at times, and the Bank tends to be rather threatening for the UN. The UN&#13;
may be a bit less well-organized than we are sometimes, so that they are also difficult partners,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            Pieter Stek&#13;
                               November 14 and 15, 2002 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                          30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and then there's a tendency for the Bank not to talk all the time because you may be spending a&#13;
lot of time, more than you can afford. However, it's clear that they need each other. Progress has&#13;
been made, and I think will continue to be made, particularly because global public goods have&#13;
now become so important on all our agendas.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How would you assess the Bank's ability in aligning staff skill mix with its strategies and&#13;
priorities? Is the Bank still able to retain its competitive edge in attracting the right caliber staff&#13;
and to regenerate itself through a higher rate of turnover?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: I don't think that the Bank is brilliant in aligning the staff skill mix with strategies and&#13;
priorities. I am not aware of a careful evaluation. That would be very useful. I have already&#13;
spoken about the budgetary constraints and about the incentive system indirectly from the angle&#13;
of Human Resources. I'm not very impressed by the Bank in that respect. I don't see all that&#13;
many giants anymore among the higher levels, so I feel that the Bank needs to restore a lot of&#13;
quality at the mid- and higher levels of Management.&#13;
&#13;
For a while its Young Professionals Program was cut back so much that it became ridiculous. I'm&#13;
not sure, but I think there's been some increase again from the minimal number of a few dozen to&#13;
something that may be significantly higher again. It's also important that a guarantee of a job&#13;
after successful completion of the Young Professionals Program has been restored again. I&#13;
thought it folly to abolish it, incredible folly.&#13;
&#13;
I never was on the Personnel Committee, so I follow this at some distance, but I'm appalled by&#13;
the rigidities in our Human Resources Department and the lack of integration from a policy point&#13;
of view of HR with the real issues of the Bank. I hope Kathy [Katherine Sierra] can deal with&#13;
that. She is sensible, but as in many countries and ministries these are often weak departments.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How much is the Bank's organizational culture amenable to letting go of certain habits and&#13;
customs and just moving on in line with its priorities and strategies?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: It's hard to generalize. I've met many staff working in my countries who are absolutely&#13;
driven by the needs of the country and are very idealistic. Yet one does, at a somewhat more&#13;
aggregate level, sense that there are resistances in the organization. But if somebody were to ask&#13;
you, â&#128;&#156;Tell me about examples where you encounter this,â&#128;? then you would have to think very&#13;
hard to say, â&#128;&#156;Yes, I remember how totally wrongheaded the Bank approach was in those cases.â&#128;?&#13;
I don't think there are that many cases, except due to inexperience and lack of leadership. The&#13;
people who come to the Bank are very often the right kind of people, but they require leadership.&#13;
When we talk of behavioral change, there used to be the issue of arrogance of the technocrats. I&#13;
think that is largely outdated now. I don't feel that is a big problem, although one does still have&#13;
the occasional complaint from a country about the high-handedness of some sector person or&#13;
some country economist. I feel that it has been impressed upon the Bank staff that they need to&#13;
listen very carefully and not to try to impose their own views without having done that.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Moving on to the Bank Presidents. What is your assessment of President Wolfensohn and&#13;
his mission so far? Since you came here when Wolfensohn had just came on board . . .&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
STEK: I think he had all the right ideals to make the Bank survive in a very unpleasant&#13;
environment for the Bretton Woods institutions, so I think he has redirected the Bank in an&#13;
absolutely essential way. And I forget whether we discussed it earlier, but there was a time lag&#13;
internally before the organization adjusted to all the changes in the external approach to the&#13;
clients. There was a significant time lag, which created a lot of frustration in the Board, and&#13;
created some frustration with Mr. Wolfensohn himself because he felt that the Board wasn't&#13;
supportive enough and complained too much. Those problems are largely over, and I think the&#13;
relationship is much better. This is also related to the two-hats issue which we discussed earlier,&#13;
so he has major achievements to his credit; in fact, achievements of such significance that the&#13;
Bank is in a much better position vis-a-vis the public at large, its clients and its shareholders.&#13;
&#13;
It's not easy to say, even if you want to, that the Bank is not doing a reasonable job and doesn't&#13;
have persuasive reasoning at hand for those who would like to undermine it, like the members of&#13;
the [Allan H.] Meltzer Commission who wrote the majority report. It was a totally stupid report,&#13;
by the way, written by people who had better knowledge, I think, of how the IMF worked than&#13;
how the Bank and IFC work. So my assessment is pretty favorable, particularly the fact that we&#13;
have a checks-and-balances system in the institution, a constructive one that is working with&#13;
OED and the Inspection Panel, as we discussed.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Yes. What should the Board of Governors and EDs look for when seeking a successor to&#13;
Wolfensohn?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Somebody who continues with what Wolfensohn is stressing at the moment, that now&#13;
weâ&#128;&#153;ve reached a stage of implementation. We really believe that we are working within the right&#13;
framework for achieving effective development. Now the challenge is to implement. I think that&#13;
is true as long as one keeps the framework in mind all the time. So when looking for a successor,&#13;
we should find somebody who understands the framework, is inspired by it, is deeply interested&#13;
in bringing about development in the world and bringing countries on a more equal footing in the&#13;
interests of prosperity and security and, ultimately, peace, and by coping with the danger--the&#13;
two billion that we keep on talking about that will be added to the world population within the&#13;
next 25 years and of whom 99 percent will be in poor countries--that they don't have a future.&#13;
We need somebody who really understands the enormous significance of these issues and who is&#13;
also willing to drive the institution to implementation and inspire all the bodies in the world and&#13;
the shareholders to subscribe to that agenda.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank has a major advocacy mission and a major implementation mission for the next period.&#13;
We're off to a reasonably good start, but I do think that a capital increase is essential, given the&#13;
enormous risk which is absorbing such a lot of our gross income at the moment in provisions and&#13;
of our net income in reserves. The need for reserves is so high because the riskiness of the&#13;
portfolio has increased so much, and that leaves very little leeway for doing what we want and&#13;
need to do.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In your view, how well has the Bank responded to the global agenda, and how do you see its&#13;
evolving role and continued relevance on the global stage, in terms of long-term challenges?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                              November 14 and 15, 2002 â&#128;&#147; Final edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STEK: It helped to create the global agenda, so I think the Bank is responding to what it&#13;
believes itself, and I think we are extremely relevant on the global stage. The world would be a&#13;
much more dangerous place without an institution like the Bank. I believe our founding fathers&#13;
had incredible foresight in creating an institution of this kind with its system of global rule of&#13;
law, which is not understood all that well by a number of present-day shareholders. They really&#13;
had the right idea in mind that we're all in this together. That was what the founding fathers&#13;
appeared to understand.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How should the Bank respond to its critics?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: By its performance and, of course, by a good public-relations department, which is able&#13;
to tell the truth based on a good performance.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Looking back at your six years in this institution, what stands out as the toughest issue you&#13;
had to handle at the Board and the most successful?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: Let's see. In the narrow sense, the Iran loan was a tough one for me to handle at the&#13;
Board, but at an institutional level, that was an incident. Bringing trade back to the agenda was&#13;
very important, and it was successful. Trade is simply more important than aid. The dangers in&#13;
that field are still enormous: that Doha will not be successful, that narrow interests will prevail.&#13;
That would be a true disaster. The countries that want to make up through aid what they are not&#13;
doing in the field of trade are deeply hypocritical and totally misguided, even about their own&#13;
interests, which they don't appear to understand. Trade is an incredibly important item on the&#13;
world agenda.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What do you see as your contribution to the Bank as a Board member? And at the same&#13;
time, what have you learned from your experience at the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
STEK: These are difficult questions.&#13;
&#13;
Q: That's why we leave them for last.&#13;
&#13;
STEK: I've tried to take the Bank seriously, and that has not been difficult because I felt the&#13;
issues were very important. I've tried to contribute to the debate by being very outspoken at&#13;
times, simply also telling other chairs very directly if I did not agree with them. I have a feeling&#13;
that that was, on the whole, appreciated. We did not work from prepared statements very often,&#13;
so I was writing what I wanted to say during the meeting, and that has been helpful, I think, for&#13;
the atmosphere. And what I've learned is the complexity of development, of life in general.&#13;
Towards the end of my career, it has been a tremendous enrichment to move away from the&#13;
somewhat narrow focus of a central bank--a very legitimate focus, but a narrow one--and from a&#13;
Finance Ministry, to become aware of how difficult development is and how it requires ongoing&#13;
effort. So if you're going to ask me what the most important advice is to give to my successors. .&#13;
&#13;
Q: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
STEK: I see that in your list of questions.&#13;

Then, I would say develop a real interest in the issues that the Bank is tackling and give your&#13;
very best. It's worth it!&#13;
