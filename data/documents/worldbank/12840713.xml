            The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
            include benchmarks related to children's health and
            sanitation. Government and non-governmental organizations
            working to meet these goals by 2015 continue to face many
            challenges. Learning about effective approaches that result
            in sustainable behavior change in sanitation and hygiene, in
            particular handwashing with soap could strengthen efforts
            and have a positive impact on the well- being of millions of
            people, especially the poor. In December 2006, the Water and
            Sanitation Program (WSP) launched the Global Scaling up
            Handwashing Project to apply innovative promotional
            approaches to behavior change to generate widespread and
            sustained improvements in handwashing with soap at scale.
