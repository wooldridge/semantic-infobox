Sup Lee provided macroeconomic data; the Migration and Remittances&#13;
unit provided worker remittances and compensation of employee data.&#13;
Many others within the World Bank provided helpful input, including country&#13;
economists who reviewed the data. The work was carried out under the&#13;
management of Ms. Shaida Badiee.&#13;
&#13;
The production of this volume was managed by Azita Amjadi, with the&#13;
assistance of Alison Kwong, Jomo Tariku, and Vera Wen. The CD-ROM and&#13;

The Little Data Book on External Debt, a pocket edition of Global&#13;
Development Finance 2011: External Debt of Developing Countries, contains&#13;
statistical tables on the external debt of the 128 countries that report&#13;
public and publicly guaranteed external debt under the Debtor Reporting&#13;
System. It also includes tables of selected debt and resource flow&#13;
statistics for individual reporting countries as well as summary tables for&#13;
regional and income groups. It is the culmination of a year-long process&#13;
that requires extensive cooperation from people and organizations around&#13;
the globeâ&#128;&#148;national central banks, ministries of finance, major multilateral&#13;
organizations, and many departments of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The Little Data Book on External Debt provides a quick reference for&#13;
users of the Global Development Finance 2011 book, CD-ROM, and online&#13;
database. The general cutoff date for data is September 2010.&#13;
&#13;
The Little Data Book on External Debt covers external debt stocks and flows,&#13;
major economic aggregates, key debt ratios, and the currency composition&#13;
of long-term external debt for all countries reporting through the Debtor&#13;
Reporting System. Terms used in tables are defined in the Glossary.&#13;
&#13;
The economic aggregates presented in the tables are prepared for the&#13;
convenience of users. Although debt ratios can provide useful information&#13;
about developments in debt-servicing capacity, drawing valid conclusions&#13;
from them requires careful economic evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
The macroeconomic information is from standard sources, but much of&#13;
it is subject to considerable margins of error, and the usual care must be&#13;
taken in interpreting the indicators. This is particularly the case for the&#13;
most recent year, for which figures are preliminary and subject to revision.&#13;

Unless otherwise indicated, all data are in millions of U.S. dollars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The following symbols are used throughout the tables:&#13;
&#13;
 0.0      indicates that data exist, but are negligible or a true zero.&#13;
&#13;
     ..   indicates that data are not available.&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;&#148;    indicates that data have not been calculated.&#13;
&#13;
     $    indicates current U.S. dollars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Converting to a common currency&#13;
&#13;
 Debt data are normally reported to the World Bank in the currency&#13;
 of repayment. To produce summary tables, these data have to be&#13;
 converted to a common currency (U.S. dollars). Because flow data&#13;
 are converted at average annual exchange rates and stock data at&#13;
 year-end exchange rates, year to year changes in debt outstanding&#13;
 and disbursed are sometimes not equal to net flows (disbursements&#13;
 less principal repayments). Similarly, changes in debt outstanding,&#13;
 including undisbursed debt, differ from commitments less repayments.&#13;
 Discrepancies are particularly large when exchange rates have moved&#13;
 sharply during the year; cancellations and reschedulings of other&#13;
 liabilities into long-term public debt also contribute to the differences.&#13;

element of staff estimation. Estimated data indicate that countries are not&#13;
current in their reporting and that a significant element of staff estimation&#13;
has been necessary in producing the data tables.&#13;

&amp;#12;                  Income group tables&#13;
For operational and analytical purposes the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s main criterion&#13;
for classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Each&#13;
economy in The Little Book on External Debt is classified as low income&#13;
or middle income. Low- and middle-income economies are sometimes&#13;
referred to as developing economies. The use of the term is convenient; it&#13;
is not intended to imply that all economies in the group are experiencing&#13;
similar development or that other economies have reached a preferred or&#13;
final stage of development. Classification by income does not necessarily&#13;
reflect development status.&#13;
&#13;
Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $995 or less&#13;
in 2009.&#13;
&#13;
Middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of more than&#13;
$996 but less than $12,195. Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-&#13;
income economies are separated at a GNI per capita of $3,946.&#13;

Bonds are debt instruments issued by public and publicly guaranteed or&#13;
private debtors with duration of one year or longer. Bonds usually give the&#13;
holder the unconditional right to fixed money income or contractually deter-&#13;
mined, variable money income.&#13;
&#13;
Currency composition of public and publicly guaranteed debt provides&#13;
information on the share of loans outstanding and disbursed by currency&#13;
of repayment. For major multilateral creditors, the currency composition of&#13;
the relevant unit of account is also taken into account. The principle curren-&#13;
cies in which the external debt of low-and middle-income countries is con-&#13;
tracted (the euro, Japanese yen, and U.S. dollar) are separately identified.&#13;
Beginning in 2001, debt denominated in the currencies of the members in&#13;
the euro area is included under the euro rather than the national currencies&#13;
that previously prevailed.&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements are drawings during the year specified on loan commit-&#13;
ments contracted by the borrower.&#13;
&#13;
Exports of goods, services, and income constitute the total value of&#13;
exports of goods and services, receipts of compensation of nonresident&#13;
workers, and investment income from abroad.&#13;
&#13;
External debt per capita is total external debt divided by midyear popula-&#13;
tion.&#13;
&#13;
External debt ratios are ratios of debt and debt service to selected eco-&#13;
nomic aggregates.&#13;
&#13;
External debt service to exports, also called the external debt service&#13;
ratio, is the ratio of external debt service paid to exports of goods and&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;
External debt stocks comprise public and publicly guaranteed long-term&#13;
external debt, private nonguaranteed long-term external debt, use of IMF&#13;
credit, and short-term external debt, including interest arrears on long-term&#13;
debt.&#13;
&#13;
External debt stocks to exports is the ratio ofoutstanding external debt&#13;
to the value of exports of goods and services and receipts of income from&#13;
abroad..&#13;
&#13;
External debt stocks to GNI is the ratio of outstanding external debt to&#13;
gross national income.&#13;
&#13;
Foreign direct investment, net refers direct investment flows in the report-&#13;
ing economy. It is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment earnings and&#13;
other capital. The term describes a category of international investment&#13;

other than that of the investor (direct investment enterprise). Ownership of&#13;
10 percent or more of the ordinary shares or voting stock is the criterion for&#13;
determining the existence of a direct investment relationship.&#13;
&#13;
Gross national income (GNI) is the sum of value added by all resident pro-&#13;
ducers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation&#13;
of output, plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees&#13;
and property income) from abroad. Yearly average exchange rates are used&#13;
to convert GNI from local currency to U.S. dollars.&#13;
&#13;
International Monetary Fund (IMF) charges are the amounts of interest&#13;
paid in foreign currency in the year specified for transactions with the IMF.&#13;
&#13;
International Monetary Fund (IMF) purchases are the total drawings on&#13;

actions with the IMF.&#13;
&#13;
Interest in arrears on long-term external debt are interest payments due&#13;
but not paid, shown on a cumulative basis. Interest arrears are due and&#13;
payable immediately and are therefore regarded as short-term obligations.&#13;
Thus, an increase in interest arrears on long-term debt will be recorded as&#13;
an increase in short-term debt. Interest in arrears on the use of IMF credit&#13;
is also considered to be part of short-term external debt.&#13;
&#13;
Interest payments are the amount of interest paid in foreign currency,&#13;
goods, or services in the year specified.&#13;
&#13;
Long-term external debt is debt that has an original or extended maturity&#13;
of more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents by residents of an&#13;
economy and repayable in foreign currency, goods, or services.&#13;
&#13;
Net flows on external debt are disbursements on long-term external debt&#13;
and IMF purchases minus principal repayments on long-term external debt&#13;
and IMF repurchases&#13;
&#13;
Net transfers are net flows minus interest payments.&#13;
&#13;
Official creditors are governments or other bilateral public entities, such&#13;
as export-import agencies, development agencies, and multilateral finan-&#13;
cial institutions, such as the World Bank and regional development banks. .&#13;
&#13;
Population is the midyear estimate of all residents regardless of legal&#13;
status or citizenship, except for refugees not permanently settled in the&#13;
country of asylum, who are generally considered part of the population of&#13;
their country of origin.&#13;

Present value of external debt outstanding is the nominal value of all&#13;
future debt service obligations on existing debt discounted at prevailing&#13;
market rates of interest. The interest rates used in this calculation are&#13;
the Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRR) for each relevant currency&#13;
compiled and published by theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and&#13;
Development.&#13;
&#13;
Present value of external debt to exports is the ratio of the present&#13;
value of external debt to exports of goods and services. It is calculated&#13;
as the ratio of the present value of external debt for 2009 to the three&#13;
year (2007â&#128;&#147;09) average of exports and might include World Bank staff&#13;
estimates.&#13;
&#13;
Present value of external debt to GNI is the ratio of the present value of&#13;
external debt to gross national income (GNI). It is calculated as the ratio&#13;
of the present value of external debt for 2009 to the three-year (2007â&#128;&#147;09)&#13;
average of GNI and might include World Bank staff estimates.&#13;
&#13;
Principal repayments are the amounts of principal (amortization) paid in&#13;
foreign currency, goods, or services.&#13;
&#13;
Private creditors are bondholders, commercial banks, and other trade&#13;
related lenders.&#13;
&#13;
Private nonguaranteed debt is debt owed by private sector borrowers to&#13;
external creditors on loans that do not benefit from a public sector guaran-&#13;
tee by the debtor country.&#13;
&#13;
Profit remittances on FDI are payments of direct investment income&#13;
(debit side), which consist of income on equity (dividends, branch profits,&#13;
and reinvested earnings) and income on intercompany debt (interest).&#13;
&#13;
Public and publicly guaranteed debt comprises public debt (an external&#13;
obligation of a public debtor, such as the national government or agency,&#13;
a political subdivision or agency, or an autonomous public body) and&#13;
publicly guaranteed external debt (an external obligation of a private debtor&#13;
that is guaranteed for repayment by a public entity).&#13;

            The little data book on external debt, a
            pocket edition of global development finance 2011: external
            debt of developing countries contains statistical tables on
            the external debt of the 128 countries that report public
            and publicly guaranteed external debt under the debtor
            reporting system. It also includes tables of selected debt
            and resource flow statistics for individual reporting
            countries as well as summary tables for regional and income
            groups. It is the culmination of a year-long process that
            requires extensive cooperation from people and organizations
            around the globe, national central banks, Ministry of
            finance, major multilateral organizations, and many
            departments of the World Bank. The little data book on
            external debt provides a quick reference for users of the
            global development finance 2011 book, CD-ROM, and online
            database. The general cutoff date for data is September
            2010. The little data book on external debt covers external
            debt stocks and flows, major economic aggregates, key debt
            ratios, and the currency composition of long-term external
            debt for all countries reporting through the debtor
            reporting system.
