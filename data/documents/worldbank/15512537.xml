&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:    I think we should at least start&#13;
&#13;
 before we break for lunch so let's get moving.           We, as Jim&#13;
&#13;
 said, we will be discussing three papers.           First, Building&#13;
&#13;
 Poverty Reduction Strategies in Developing Countries;&#13;
&#13;
 secondly, the HIPC Initiative: Strengthening the Link&#13;
&#13;
 between Debt Relief and Poverty Reduction.          That paper, as&#13;
&#13;
 you know, was prepared jointly by the IDA and Fund staff.&#13;
&#13;
 And thirdly, Social and Structural Reviews - Progress and&#13;
&#13;
 Lessons.&#13;
&#13;
             You've also received for information a parallel&#13;
&#13;
 IMF paper on the "Review of Social Issues and Policies in&#13;
&#13;
 IMF-Supported Programs," and this paper together with a&#13;
&#13;
 joint HIPC linked paper will be discussed by the Fund&#13;
&#13;
 board on September 13.&#13;
&#13;
             And I believe we have colleagues from the IMF&#13;
&#13;
 here, Russell Kincaid, David Andrews and Christian&#13;
&#13;
 Schiller.    They are here.    Great.    Welcome.    And we have a&#13;
&#13;
 number of statements from Anna Brandt, Godfrey Gaoseb,&#13;
&#13;
 Stephen Pickford, Mr. Toure and Mr. Wan Abdullah.          And&#13;
&#13;
 Masood will give a brief introduction first providing the&#13;
&#13;
 connections between the three papers and then Mike Walton&#13;
&#13;
 will give the introduction on the poverty reduction&#13;
                                                                       Page3&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 strategy paper and then Peter Fallon on the HIPC link&#13;
&#13;
 paper.   So Masood, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. AHMED:   Thank you very much, Sven.   Just&#13;
&#13;
 very briefly, to pick up on the point that we left off at&#13;
&#13;
 the end of July when we briefed you on the overall board&#13;
&#13;
 program leading up to the poverty action plan or the&#13;
&#13;
 different elements of it.     You'll recall that we had&#13;
&#13;
 talked about one set of papers that we would be working on&#13;
&#13;
 which would be trying to strengthen the link between the&#13;
&#13;
 poverty focus of country specific work, and that's where&#13;
&#13;
 we were going to talk about the work that we were going to&#13;
&#13;
 do to build greater links between our own country programs&#13;
&#13;
 and country strategies and their impact on poverty, and&#13;
&#13;
 how we wanted to ensure that the same approach was also&#13;
&#13;
 consistent with what was being done in the HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 enhancements.   And that's why those two papers in some&#13;
&#13;
 sense are very much dovetailed because the underlying&#13;
&#13;
 approach that we want to apply in the HIPC cases is really&#13;
&#13;
 a way of moving forward rapidly with the same approach&#13;
&#13;
 that we want to generalize and apply more broadly to all&#13;
&#13;
 of our country assistance strategies.&#13;
&#13;
           The Social and Structural Reviews came up at&#13;
&#13;
 that time and we mentioned that we saw these as a key&#13;
                                                              Page4&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 building block in terms of identifying the main obstacles&#13;
&#13;
 that impeded the poverty reduction and development&#13;
&#13;
 objectives in each country and so we wanted to circulate&#13;
&#13;
 that status report on the early social and structural&#13;
&#13;
 reviews as background for today's discussion because again&#13;
&#13;
 that's one of the building blocks that leads into it.&#13;
&#13;
            I just want to say one more word that in&#13;
&#13;
 addition to the paper that Sven referred to that is the,&#13;
&#13;
 if you like, the corollary paper in the Fund in some ways&#13;
&#13;
 that's being done on social aspects of the Fund's&#13;
&#13;
 programs, which we circulated to you for background&#13;
&#13;
 information, our paper on building poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategies at the country level is also being circulated&#13;
&#13;
 for background to the Fund board's discussion because&#13;
&#13;
 again we do see all of these three pieces as being very&#13;
&#13;
 much an integrated and joined up approach to moving&#13;
&#13;
 forward on making poverty more central to our collective&#13;
&#13;
 efforts.&#13;
&#13;
            And a final point I want to make is that on&#13;
&#13;
 Tuesday, we talked about the social aspects of crisis,&#13;
&#13;
 financial crisis, and a number of executive directors&#13;
&#13;
 raised the question of how that particular effort fitted&#13;
&#13;
 into this overall framework for enhancing the poverty&#13;
                                                              Page5&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 focus of our work, and when Mike talks about the approach&#13;
&#13;
 here, we will try and pick up on making that connection&#13;
&#13;
 clearer because we see that as being again one of the how-&#13;
&#13;
 to efforts dealing with one specific source of&#13;
&#13;
 vulnerability that affects poverty outcomes in certain set&#13;
&#13;
 of countries.   So again the connection there is one that&#13;
&#13;
 we would like to make explicitly.        So that's just to try&#13;
&#13;
 and put it in terms of context, but the next thing would&#13;
&#13;
 be to get more introduction on the specific papers&#13;
&#13;
 themselves.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:     Thanks, Masood.        Mike, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. WALTON:    Thank you very much.        The proposed&#13;
&#13;
 approach to incorporating poverty into country strategies&#13;
&#13;
 is very much a follow-up to a number of discussions that&#13;
&#13;
 we've had with the board in the past.          It is a central&#13;
&#13;
 element of our corporate strategy to develop practical&#13;
&#13;
 actions to systematically link all of our work to poverty&#13;
&#13;
 and it is, of course, a key aspect of the&#13;
&#13;
 operationalization of the Comprehensive Development&#13;
&#13;
 Framework.    Our interactions with executive directors have&#13;
&#13;
 been most useful to this process and we specifically&#13;
&#13;
 appreciate the comments we have received on these papers.&#13;
                                                                     Page6&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             The approach laid out in these papers is&#13;
&#13;
 fundamentally about how we integrate poverty into country&#13;
&#13;
 strategy.    This is based, of course, on a body of&#13;
&#13;
 substantive work on the determinants of poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 and, as Masood noted, it is complementary to the work on&#13;
&#13;
 good practices in managing social dimensions of crises.&#13;
&#13;
 That work that we reported on the progress on Tuesday, we&#13;
&#13;
 see as the material on good practice for advising on one&#13;
&#13;
 important aspect of the relationship between country&#13;
&#13;
 strategy and poverty which would constitute the&#13;
&#13;
 ingredients to be incorporated into the framework laid out&#13;
&#13;
 here.&#13;
&#13;
             I'd also emphasize that in terms of substance,&#13;
&#13;
 the framework draws on the initial thinking in the World&#13;
&#13;
 Development Report for the coming year.             In particular, it&#13;
&#13;
 emphasizes the importance of security and of empowerment&#13;
&#13;
 within any country based poverty reduction strategy.            We&#13;
&#13;
 see action in these two areas as necessary complements to&#13;
&#13;
 measures that enhance the material opportunities of the&#13;
&#13;
 poor, and this is something that needs to be made&#13;
&#13;
 explicit.&#13;
&#13;
             The board will be having an opportunity for&#13;
&#13;
 further discussion of these, the substantive thinking for&#13;
                                                                         Page7&#13;

&#13;
 the WDR, in the discussion of the WDR outline on the 17th&#13;
&#13;
 of September.&#13;
&#13;
           And in this introduction, I would just like to&#13;
&#13;
 emphasize four points, largely in response to some of the&#13;
&#13;
 comments received.   First point is that participatory&#13;
&#13;
 processes and country ownerships are central features of&#13;
&#13;
 the process, as has been emphasized in the comments by Ms.&#13;
&#13;
 Brandt, Mr. Gaoseb and Mr. Pickford.        This applies at the&#13;
&#13;
 level of the definition of country goals, to the&#13;
&#13;
 monitoring of delivery of services, and also to the&#13;
&#13;
 analysis of an interpretation of progress.         And we see&#13;
&#13;
 this very much again as an application of the principles&#13;
&#13;
 that underpin the Comprehensive Development Framework.&#13;
&#13;
           I'd just like to take note of one issue, an&#13;
&#13;
 issue raised by Mr. Wan Abdul Aziz, and this is that the&#13;
&#13;
 structure of civil society engagement has to be worked out&#13;
&#13;
 at a country level and it is in particular important in&#13;
&#13;
 designing this that we work out mechanisms or the country&#13;
&#13;
 works out mechanisms that assure the involvement of civil&#13;
&#13;
 society institutions that genuinely represent the poor and&#13;
&#13;
 indeed work out mechanisms for strengthening and involving&#13;
&#13;
 organizations of the poor themselves.         This we see as one&#13;
                                                                    Page8&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 important element of the emerging WDR strategy that we'll&#13;
&#13;
 be discussing in the future.&#13;
&#13;
             Second, the approach has important implications&#13;
&#13;
 for the diagnostic and information basis for country&#13;
&#13;
 strategy formulation and implementation.            As the progress&#13;
&#13;
 report on social and structural reviews lays out, we are&#13;
&#13;
 moving towards a more systematic approach to linking the&#13;
&#13;
 macroeconomic social and structural agenda to poverty&#13;
&#13;
 outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
             A couple of issues I'd like to respond to that&#13;
&#13;
 were raised in comments.     First is that the diagnostic&#13;
&#13;
 work has to be within a comprehensive frame.           This doesn't&#13;
&#13;
 mean diluting sectoral analysis, as a point made by Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Wan Abdul Aziz, but it does mean systematically linking&#13;
&#13;
 sectoral work to poverty outcomes and recognizing the&#13;
&#13;
 intersectoral linkages that are both often powerful and&#13;
&#13;
 have largely or significantly been neglected in both our&#13;
&#13;
 work and those of other institutions.&#13;
&#13;
             In this context, we would very much agree with a&#13;
&#13;
 point made by Mr. Pickford that this should include&#13;
&#13;
 explicit assessment of the distributional consequences of&#13;
&#13;
 macroeconomic choices, and not just an analysis of the&#13;
                                                                       Page9&#13;

&#13;
 effects of what have been traditionally labeled as social&#13;
&#13;
 policies.&#13;
&#13;
             We'd also take note of Ms. Brandt's point that&#13;
&#13;
 if we go ahead and introduce poverty notes, that we must&#13;
&#13;
 ensure that these strengthen and not weaken what is the&#13;
&#13;
 central endeavor, and that is to put poverty at the center&#13;
&#13;
 of country strategies.     We've not reached closure on this.&#13;
&#13;
 We are actually now working through how best to reshape&#13;
&#13;
 our poverty assessment process in a fashion that will&#13;
&#13;
 underpin the enhanced poverty focus and we'll be coming&#13;
&#13;
 back to you on that with specific recommendations for&#13;
&#13;
 discussion in the context of the poverty progress report&#13;
&#13;
 in the next couple of months.&#13;
&#13;
             Second general point is undertaking this&#13;
&#13;
 diagnosis and shifting to a genuinely outcome-based&#13;
&#13;
 process of monitoring and implementation has significant&#13;
&#13;
 implications for the production and availability of&#13;
&#13;
 information.    Many countries will not initially have an&#13;
&#13;
 optimal information base.      We don't think that this means&#13;
&#13;
 you have to delay moving towards an outcome-oriented&#13;
&#13;
 approach.    We don't need to a have perfection in order to&#13;
&#13;
 start on this process, but it does mean in these cases&#13;
&#13;
 that it will be important to have a clear approach to&#13;
                                                                 Page10&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 developing the information system as an integral component&#13;
&#13;
 of a country strategy.&#13;
&#13;
             This leads to our third point, that in many&#13;
&#13;
 countries moving in the direction advocated will need to&#13;
&#13;
 be complemented by quite major efforts in capacity&#13;
&#13;
 building, a point noted by both Mr. Gaoseb and Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Pickford.    This will certainly apply to statistical&#13;
&#13;
 systems, but is also very much broader.             It implies&#13;
&#13;
 developing the capacity in governments, in think tanks,&#13;
&#13;
 and in civil society to analyze and interpret progress and&#13;
&#13;
 participate in informed country level dialogue.            This&#13;
&#13;
 will, of course, often require support from the&#13;
&#13;
 international donor community.&#13;
&#13;
             Fourth, and perhaps most important, that while&#13;
&#13;
 the approach very much builds on ongoing country&#13;
&#13;
 experiences, it will involve over time a really quite&#13;
&#13;
 substantial shift in the way in which we work.            And this&#13;
&#13;
 does imply quite a major challenge in implementation, both&#13;
&#13;
 for the country teams that will be supporting countries&#13;
&#13;
 and framing outcome oriented programs and for the networks&#13;
&#13;
 in providing the technical support and the international&#13;
&#13;
 experience on the links between public action and&#13;
&#13;
 outcomes.     We see this as an effort that will need to be&#13;
                                                                      Page11&#13;

&#13;
 phased over time, as emphasized by Mr. Gaoseb, with a very&#13;
&#13;
 important role for systematically sharing experience as we&#13;
&#13;
 go along.    So we look forward to reactions to the proposed&#13;
&#13;
 approaches.    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:   Thank you very much, Mike.&#13;
&#13;
 Peter.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. FALLON:   Thank you very much.      The paper I'm&#13;
&#13;
 discussing looks at some of the implications of applying&#13;
&#13;
 the poverty reduction strategy framework laid out in the&#13;
&#13;
 paper discussed by Michael to the HIPC Initiative&#13;
&#13;
 countries.    We believe that the conclusions apply to a&#13;
&#13;
 rather wider set of countries than the HIPCs and have&#13;
&#13;
 similar implications for other IDA countries and even&#13;
&#13;
 perhaps for IBRD countries.      The paper as noted is jointly&#13;
&#13;
 written by Bank and IMF staff.       It's worth pointing out it&#13;
&#13;
 draws on extensive consultation with civil society&#13;
&#13;
 undertaken as part of Phase II of the review of the HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 Initiative.    A compendium of views received under this&#13;
&#13;
 consultation has been circulated to the executive&#13;
&#13;
 directors.&#13;
&#13;
             In applying the framework to the HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 Initiative, the paper suggests I think two main&#13;
&#13;
 principles.    First, as a poverty reduction strategy is a&#13;
                                                                     Page12&#13;

                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 long-term effort spanning say 15 years or more, HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 programs should be seen as applying only to the first few&#13;
&#13;
 years of this long effort.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, the best way of ensuring a strong link&#13;
&#13;
 between debt relief and poverty reduction is to deploy all&#13;
&#13;
 resources including domestic revenue and debt relief&#13;
&#13;
 towards the goal of poverty reduction.         HIPC decisions&#13;
&#13;
 would then be integrated into a comprehensive effort to&#13;
&#13;
 reduce poverty.   Debt relief would be seen as only one&#13;
&#13;
 element in the financing of the long-term poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategy.&#13;
&#13;
           The need for closer cooperation between the&#13;
&#13;
 coauthors, that's the Bank and the Fund, will be&#13;
&#13;
 accentuated under the new framework.        The main elements of&#13;
&#13;
 the strategy it's proposed would be published in a&#13;
&#13;
 tripartite document, which we're calling for now "The&#13;
&#13;
 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper," or PRSP, for short.&#13;
&#13;
 This would be endorsed by the government, the Bank and the&#13;
&#13;
 Fund.   It would show how Bank and Fund lending supports&#13;
&#13;
 the strategy and it would require approval by the boards&#13;
&#13;
 of both institutions.&#13;
&#13;
           The IMF paper that Sven referred to on the&#13;
&#13;
 "Review of Social Issues and Policies in IMF-Supported&#13;
                                                                    Page13&#13;

&#13;
 Programs" clearly sees the PRSP as a stimulus to improved&#13;
&#13;
 collaboration by, for example, better integrating&#13;
&#13;
 macroeconomic and social objectives, policy measures and&#13;
&#13;
 related work agendas.     The Bank CAS would fully reflect&#13;
&#13;
 the strategy and use performance under this framework as&#13;
&#13;
 the basis for setting the various lending envelopes.&#13;
&#13;
             As Ms. Brandt noted very aptly in her statement,&#13;
&#13;
 overall consistency of IDA and ESAF-supported programs is&#13;
&#13;
 a key to successful strengthening of the poverty focus in&#13;
&#13;
 all work and specifically in the enhanced HIPC.&#13;
&#13;
             For the Fund, the ESAF would continue to play&#13;
&#13;
 its present role but would now be seen as supporting the&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction strategy as a whole and not just the&#13;
&#13;
 macroeconomic and structural components.            This may affect&#13;
&#13;
 IMF time-tabling as processes of developing strategies are&#13;
&#13;
 likely to be lengthy and it's likely that achieving&#13;
&#13;
 overall consistency will require some iteration between&#13;
&#13;
 the macroeconomic targets and other components of this&#13;
&#13;
 strategy.&#13;
&#13;
             For the Bank, I won't say much.         My colleague&#13;
&#13;
 went into this.    This means deepening and extending work&#13;
&#13;
 using outcome-based criteria and participatory processes.&#13;
&#13;
 This is a major task that will take time.           Nevertheless,&#13;
                                                                       Page14&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 we propose as a first step establishing poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategies along the lines suggested.&#13;
&#13;
           We are very grateful for responses received thus&#13;
&#13;
 far from the executive directors and we're encouraged by&#13;
&#13;
 the rather strong sense of support that their comments&#13;
&#13;
 convey.   Let me expand briefly on some of the points.&#13;
&#13;
           We share the concerns raised by Ms. Brandt and&#13;
&#13;
 by Messrs. Pickford and Kelmanson that there should be no&#13;
&#13;
 undue delay in the provision of additional debt relief in&#13;
&#13;
 countries already having a well-defined poverty strategy.&#13;
&#13;
 The suggestion in the paper is that while it is desirable&#13;
&#13;
 that an appropriate poverty reduction strategy be in place&#13;
&#13;
 at the decision point, it has to be recognized that this&#13;
&#13;
 will not always be possible as building a strategy takes&#13;
&#13;
 time.   For retroactive countries, the paper suggest that&#13;
&#13;
 each country be treated on a case-by-case basis.&#13;
&#13;
           We agree fully with Mr. Toure's comment that we&#13;
&#13;
 should be careful not to believe that investing in the&#13;
&#13;
 social sectors is the only key that warrants the success&#13;
&#13;
 of poverty alleviation strategies.        A related concern was&#13;
&#13;
 expressed by Mr. Gaoseb.    The need for sound macroeconomic&#13;
&#13;
 policies, better governance and better structural policies&#13;
&#13;
 is as great as ever.   Without these, growth will falter&#13;
                                                                   Page15&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 and strategies will fail.     It also may sometimes by the&#13;
&#13;
 case that social sector investment is not actually the top&#13;
&#13;
 priority for poverty alleviation.       As one example, better&#13;
&#13;
 access to safe drinking water is likely to be a priority&#13;
&#13;
 in many countries.   Achieving this actually requires in&#13;
&#13;
 general better infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
           We note the concerns expressed by Mr. Gaoseb and&#13;
&#13;
 Mr. Wan Abdul Aziz regarding the proposed PRSP.          Our view&#13;
&#13;
 is that the PRSP would be a stronger document than the&#13;
&#13;
 existing PFP as it would tighten the focus on poverty&#13;
&#13;
 alleviation by laying out the strategy and the targets in&#13;
&#13;
 detail.   Our view is that retaining both is likely to&#13;
&#13;
 result in needless duplication, however.           The CAS would&#13;
&#13;
 remain the Bank's business document as at present, but&#13;
&#13;
 would draw on the government's strategy as laid out in the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, we note Mr. Toure's point that there is&#13;
&#13;
 now a lot of experience on how to improve development&#13;
&#13;
 effectiveness and we take his point that we are saying&#13;
&#13;
 nothing really very new in the paper.         We do hope,&#13;
&#13;
 however, that by moving further along the lines suggested&#13;
&#13;
 in the paper will make a contribution to worldwide poverty&#13;
&#13;
 alleviation.   Thank you.&#13;

           MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much, Peter.&#13;
&#13;
 Later on in the afternoon, we may want to ask Fund staff&#13;
&#13;
 also to come in and comment on this from their side, but I&#13;
&#13;
 would first like to hear from some of you.         I have seven&#13;
&#13;
 names on my list so far.    It's almost one o'clock.      Should&#13;
&#13;
 we at least get started?    And Mr. Al-Saad will have the&#13;
&#13;
 honor, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. AL-SAAD:   Thank you.      It's always good to&#13;
&#13;
 start before lunch.   Well, I will restrict my remarks to&#13;
&#13;
 the first paper and I see this paper as a first step in a&#13;
&#13;
 process of taking a hard look at the Bank's poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategy.   The record in the past decade has&#13;
&#13;
 been disappointing, to say the least, with poverty&#13;
&#13;
 increasing by a lot instead of decreasing.         In looking at&#13;
&#13;
 the proposed enhanced framework, I wish we had had enough&#13;
&#13;
 time to look at it carefully.      I didn't even have enough&#13;
&#13;
 time to digest the outline of the new poverty WDR which I&#13;
&#13;
 received yesterday, though I noted it's a new and&#13;
&#13;
 interesting vision based on empowerment, security and&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity.&#13;
&#13;
           I understand, however, the urgent need to&#13;
&#13;
 consider the new framework in the view of its relevance to&#13;
&#13;
 the HIPC discussion and since it seems to have&#13;
                                                                    Page17&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 incorporated the main thrust of the forthcoming WDR.&#13;
&#13;
 Basically I am in broad agreement with the framework focus&#13;
&#13;
 on poverty outcome and the link between policy and&#13;
&#13;
 outcomes.    The three elements of the enhanced framework&#13;
&#13;
 seem fairly logical starting with understanding of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 and its determinants, choosing the policy actions that&#13;
&#13;
 have the highest poverty impact, then monitoring outcome&#13;
&#13;
 on the basis of indicators widely endorsed.           My concern is&#13;
&#13;
 that actual implementation of such enhanced framework will&#13;
&#13;
 burden the capacity of many poor developing countries,&#13;
&#13;
 especially the HIPC countries who are expected to be the&#13;
&#13;
 first target of the new approach.&#13;
&#13;
             On this, I wish to hear more from my colleagues.&#13;
&#13;
 I welcome the framework commitment to work for the&#13;
&#13;
 achievement of the international development goals of&#13;
&#13;
 cutting poverty in half by the year 2015 and other&#13;
&#13;
 targets.    I wonder, however, if this is still realistic&#13;
&#13;
 given the setbacks in the past two years.            I certainly&#13;
&#13;
 hope it still is.    One aspect that I wish the document&#13;
&#13;
 brought to light is how much the poverty policy in the&#13;
&#13;
 bulk of the countries was donor driven, whether by&#13;
&#13;
 international and regional institutions or bilaterals?&#13;
&#13;
 This clearly means that all major participants, not only&#13;
                                                                       Page18&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank and the Fund, should be adequately committed to&#13;
&#13;
 the new concept and its operational requirements.&#13;
&#13;
             Coming to the question addressed to us on the&#13;
&#13;
 operational implication, I can only give my preliminary&#13;
&#13;
 reaction.    On the first question, I do agree that outcome&#13;
&#13;
 based approach would provide a good basis for further&#13;
&#13;
 improvement of CASs.    Support for countries, however,&#13;
&#13;
 should not be mechanically based on achievement of these&#13;
&#13;
 outcomes.    As paragraph 35 points out, this might depend&#13;
&#13;
 on factors beyond the control of the country.&#13;
&#13;
             On the second question, I have no problem&#13;
&#13;
 working with governments to promote transparency and broad&#13;
&#13;
 participation of civil society in this selection and&#13;
&#13;
 monitoring of outcomes.     This should improve realism and&#13;
&#13;
 relevance of outcomes targeted and enhance ownership.&#13;
&#13;
             On the third question, I think there should&#13;
&#13;
 still be a balance between program-based lending and the&#13;
&#13;
 project lending.    Some countries may already have very&#13;
&#13;
 large program lending and others much less.         Outcome-based&#13;
&#13;
 strategies should not mean across the board increase in&#13;
&#13;
 the share of program lending.&#13;
&#13;
             Finally, on the last question, I am not sure it&#13;
&#13;
 is appropriate to apply the new framework when there is&#13;
                                                                     Page19&#13;

           MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much.      With that,&#13;
&#13;
 I suggest we break for lunch and I have not six more names&#13;
&#13;
 on my list, I have 12 more names now.         And we'll start at&#13;

 2:30 with Ruth and then Helmut and we'll take it from&#13;

 there.   Thank you.&#13;

&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    All right.      Welcome back.    I&#13;
&#13;
 think we have to start if we are going to finish.           So,&#13;
&#13;
 let's get going again.&#13;
&#13;
           Ruth, please.    It is your turn.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. BACHMAYER:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           I want, first of all, to commend management and&#13;
&#13;
 staff for the excellent documents which reflect the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
 long and rich theoretical and practical experience in&#13;
&#13;
 struggling to reduce poverty.      The building of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategies paper provides a very comprehensive&#13;
&#13;
 and at the same time concise strategic framework for the&#13;
&#13;
 operational work, and the two other documents complement&#13;
&#13;
 it by perhaps the most important links to the operational&#13;
&#13;
 work done by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
           The papers implicitly make clear how&#13;
&#13;
 underestimated and inadequately developed is the area of&#13;
&#13;
 diagnostics and monitoring of social developments compared&#13;
&#13;
 to purely economic development, including, in particular,&#13;
&#13;
 the financial sector.     Any social targeting has for this&#13;
&#13;
 reason been somewhat blind-shooting with the high risk&#13;
&#13;
 outcomes in terms of efficiency.&#13;
                                                                    Page21&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           For this reason, we much welcome the progress&#13;
&#13;
 that has been made in the attempts to root social and&#13;
&#13;
 social policies in a more solid and well-defined round.&#13;
&#13;
           We believe that the ultimate goal of the&#13;
&#13;
 policies is the effect in preventing or reducing poverty,&#13;
&#13;
 not the speed of action alone.      I particularly welcome the&#13;
&#13;
 outcome-based approach and I support the suggestion that&#13;
&#13;
 the poverty reduction framework should provide an umbrella&#13;
&#13;
 for the Bank's work in developing and it should also, of&#13;
&#13;
 course, be the basis for CASs.&#13;
&#13;
           In this respect, I welcome the social and&#13;
&#13;
 structural reviews as a systematic and structured way to&#13;
&#13;
 approach the CAS process.     We were very satisfied with the&#13;
&#13;
 report on the progress in and lessons from the SSRs and&#13;
&#13;
 consider them as an excellent diagnostic and efficient&#13;
&#13;
 tool.&#13;
&#13;
           Nevertheless, even the excellent documents&#13;
&#13;
 cannot hide the fact that some challenges and difficult&#13;
&#13;
 questions remain ahead of us.      I see, in particular, three&#13;
&#13;
 issues.&#13;
&#13;
           First, we would appreciate to learn more about&#13;
&#13;
 the management's views on the concept of the client in the&#13;
&#13;
 driver's seat in the context of the SSRs.          The SSRs will&#13;
                                                                    Page22&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 provide a single perspective or a single scenario, which&#13;
&#13;
 may not necessarily be the only one, or even not the most&#13;
&#13;
 relevant one.   There is nothing like a single set of&#13;
&#13;
 generally-accepted paradigms in the area of social and&#13;
&#13;
 structural policies.&#13;
&#13;
           We hope that management prepares a framework&#13;
&#13;
 which is really conducive for substantive inputs and&#13;
&#13;
 feedbacks from the governments and from civil society and,&#13;
&#13;
 of course, also for public discussion of the SSRs.       It&#13;
&#13;
 would be very disappointing if the implementation of the&#13;
&#13;
 desired social and structural policies took a form or were&#13;
&#13;
 felt as imposing ultimate prescriptions and give the&#13;
&#13;
 feeling of too much power by international institutions or&#13;
&#13;
 the donor community.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, we consider it important to keep enough&#13;
&#13;
 realism in the strategy and in the intentions.     The&#13;
&#13;
 requirements that the social and structural strategy for&#13;
&#13;
 many countries would impose may be far too ambitious given&#13;
&#13;
 their capacity.   I will come back to this observation in&#13;
&#13;
 the context of the HIPC paper.&#13;
&#13;
           We should not forget that building of the&#13;
&#13;
 proposed institutional arrangements, for instance,&#13;
&#13;
 information systems, has been a major challenge for&#13;
                                                               Page23&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 development economies too and it took us tens of years to&#13;
&#13;
 come to the point where we are now, we as industrial&#13;
&#13;
 countries.&#13;
&#13;
            The third point related to the relationship with&#13;
&#13;
 the IMF.   The Bank's cooperation with the IMF in the area&#13;
&#13;
 of social and structural policies remains an important&#13;
&#13;
 open issue.   The Bank has done most of its work in this&#13;
&#13;
 area, and has core competence and a competitive advantage&#13;
&#13;
 in it.   But parts of the Article IV consultations by the&#13;
&#13;
 Fund deal with social and structural issues at least with&#13;
&#13;
 their fiscal aspects.&#13;
&#13;
            For this reason, the areas of overlap seem to be&#13;
&#13;
 a natural field for shared responsibilities between the&#13;
&#13;
 two institutions.    We would welcome management's thoughts&#13;
&#13;
 on the future cooperation and sharing responsibility with&#13;
&#13;
 the Fund on the very operational level, in particular with&#13;
&#13;
 respect to the SSRs, with the structural part of the SSRs,&#13;
&#13;
 in particular.&#13;
&#13;
            I commend management for the inspiring thoughts&#13;
&#13;
 that were put to the operationalizing of the poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction programs on each stage of the Bank's work.   Many&#13;
&#13;
 elements of the proposed approach have not yet been&#13;
&#13;
 tested, and we know little on how they would work.    It&#13;

&#13;
 refers to all stages of the operational work from the&#13;
&#13;
 better coordination and communication between the regions&#13;
&#13;
 and sectors within the Bank to the use of different&#13;
&#13;
 instruments.&#13;
&#13;
           I have to say also as a footnote, I find it a&#13;
&#13;
 bit premature to include budget support lending in the set&#13;
&#13;
 of instruments.   It may have a big rationale in the&#13;
&#13;
 context of poverty-focused work of the Bank, but I think&#13;
&#13;
 it is really premature to include it in a proposal right&#13;
&#13;
 now.   We have not finished our discussion.        We have not&#13;
&#13;
 come to a conclusion on this proposal.&#13;
&#13;
           Before turning to the implications for HIPC, I&#13;
&#13;
 would like to conclude my remarks on the poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategy by saying that I believe that the next logical&#13;
&#13;
 step is to pilot the approach and carefully review the&#13;
&#13;
 experiences.&#13;
&#13;
           We also support that it would be appropriate for&#13;
&#13;
 the Board to return to the review of experience from the&#13;
&#13;
 implementation of the poverty reduction strategy and the&#13;
&#13;
 outcome-based approach in more than a year from now.&#13;
&#13;
           Turning now to "Strengthening the Link Between&#13;
&#13;
 Debt Relief and Poverty Reduction" in the context of an&#13;
&#13;
 enhanced HIPC framework, it is indeed desirable that&#13;
                                                                  Page25&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 resources freed up by debt relief should lead to an&#13;
&#13;
 increase in social investment.      But it could be&#13;
&#13;
 counterproductive if a mechanistic linkage between both&#13;
&#13;
 were to be established.&#13;
&#13;
           Debt relief is not the only source of external&#13;
&#13;
 finance in support of poverty reduction efforts, as you&#13;
&#13;
 said and as we all know.&#13;
&#13;
           While it is important for HIPC countries to have&#13;
&#13;
 a viable and comprehensive poverty reduction strategy in&#13;
&#13;
 place as soon as possible, preferably before the decision&#13;
&#13;
 point, speed should not be the over-arching objective but&#13;
&#13;
 rather sufficient attention should be given that the&#13;
&#13;
 strategy is well-balanced, that it takes into account the&#13;
&#13;
 country-specific resources and implementation constraints,&#13;
&#13;
 and that it is fully shared by all relevant stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
           I see some merit in tying the relevant length of&#13;
&#13;
 the second stage of HIPC to progress achieved in the areas&#13;
&#13;
 of structural and social reform and poverty reduction,&#13;
&#13;
 provided the actions to be undertaken by the country can&#13;
&#13;
 be monitored and not formulated in such a way that it&#13;
&#13;
 would over-burden the reform agenda.&#13;
&#13;
           This could result in a delay instead of faster&#13;
&#13;
 delivery of debt relief.    Given the fact that many HIPCs&#13;
                                                              Page26&#13;

 are highly vulnerable to external shocks, which might lead&#13;
&#13;
 to setbacks in that implementation of the reform agenda, I&#13;
&#13;
 believe that some form of judgment should be retained as&#13;
&#13;

 the delivery of social services to the poor had been met.&#13;

           MR. SCHAFFER:    Thank you, Sven.&#13;
&#13;
           In my view, these papers are milestones in the&#13;
&#13;
 poverty orientation of the Bank, and in the realization of&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank's own mission.    Especially the joint Bank-Fund&#13;
&#13;
 paper is a big step in the right direction and a success&#13;
&#13;
 for the enhanced debt relief initiative per se.&#13;
&#13;
           This paper also is very close to the thinking&#13;
&#13;
 expressed at the Utstein [phonetic] declaration of the&#13;
&#13;
 four Development Ministers of Great Britain, the&#13;
&#13;
 Netherlands, Norway and Germany from August this year.&#13;
&#13;
           Consequently, I would like to express my sincere&#13;
&#13;
 thanks to the management of both institutions for this&#13;
&#13;
 tremendous job to give a new spirit of the poverty focus&#13;
&#13;
 of the World Bank's work.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
            Let me make some comments and start with the&#13;
&#13;
 first paper, "Building Poverty Reduction Strategies in&#13;
&#13;
 Developing Countries", as it has been a key input to the&#13;
&#13;
 second paper on the HIPC Initiative.&#13;
&#13;
            This is a good and very useful paper and I agree&#13;
&#13;
 with all its key issues and recommendations.       It is&#13;
&#13;
 absolutely correct that the paper's underlying assumption&#13;
&#13;
 is based on a multi-dimensional definition of poverty and&#13;
&#13;
 its causes, paragraph 7.    Hence, as poverty is not only&#13;
&#13;
 seen in its economic context, the paper proposes a multi-&#13;
&#13;
 sectoral approach and comes to a varied set of strategies.&#13;
&#13;
            I also fully agree with paragraph 20 that it is&#13;
&#13;
 significant to analyze the multiplicity of causal factors&#13;
&#13;
 of poverty.   The paper does not explicitly mention the&#13;
&#13;
 vast differences in power and interest which lead to&#13;
&#13;
 poverty or conserve it and the consequence of strong&#13;
&#13;
 political will is a significant precondition to alleviate&#13;
&#13;
 poverty.&#13;
&#13;
            Paragraph 16 strengthens the importance of a&#13;
&#13;
 detailed analysis of poverty.      I quote, "Policy&#13;
&#13;
 formulation should start from a disaggregated&#13;
&#13;
 understanding of who the poor are, where they live and&#13;
&#13;
 their source of livelihood".      I want to add that this&#13;
                                                               Page28&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 analysis should be also carried out with a specific gender&#13;
&#13;
 focus.&#13;
&#13;
           Coming to a more strategic consideration, I&#13;
&#13;
 support the idea that poverty alleviation has to be based&#13;
&#13;
 on the specific situation of each country.          We could even&#13;
&#13;
 go further and speak of an area-specific approach, as, for&#13;
&#13;
 example, homogeneous-looking countries, like my own&#13;
&#13;
 Germany, can actually be quite diverse in nature.             There&#13;
&#13;
 is no blueprint for poverty alleviation.           I really&#13;
&#13;
 appreciate that the World Bank integrates this aspect into&#13;
&#13;
 its new focus on poverty.&#13;
&#13;
           It also makes sense to focus on the question of&#13;
&#13;
 distribution, participation and empowerment of the poor,&#13;
&#13;
 as stated in paragraphs 11 and 26, but we should not&#13;
&#13;
 forget that any empowerment of one group leads&#13;
&#13;
 simultaneously to diminishing the power of others and said&#13;
&#13;
 power structures might change to the now powerful, a&#13;
&#13;
 typical scenario of conflict.      The paper does not reflect&#13;
&#13;
 whether the World Bank should play a role in this&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment process for the poor.&#13;
&#13;
           I was also delighted to notice that the World&#13;
&#13;
 Bank is now more careful about the role of economic&#13;
&#13;
 growth.   Economic growth is still necessary, but it is not&#13;
                                                                       Page29&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 seen as a guarantee for poverty alleviation anymore.           Past&#13;
&#13;
 experiences have shown that the trickle-down effect did&#13;
&#13;
 not work out the way it was expected.&#13;
&#13;
           Paragraph 23 mentions ways to go about poverty&#13;
&#13;
 alleviation, even in times of less economic growth, but&#13;
&#13;
 obviously do not exist in addition to economic growth, as&#13;
&#13;
 stated in the paper.   Each way has its value in itself.&#13;
&#13;
           In paragraph 11, the paper raises the important&#13;
&#13;
 topic of broadly-based growth, which is directly linked to&#13;
&#13;
 the equality of income distribution, as the paper later on&#13;
&#13;
 rightly points out by stating poverty payoff to growth&#13;
&#13;
 will be high but only if the distribution of income and&#13;
&#13;
 the quality of governance are improved.            This has my full&#13;
&#13;
 sympathy and the facts that this aspect will even form&#13;
&#13;
 part of the forthcoming WDR shows the great importance it&#13;
&#13;
 also has for the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
           Only one question remains:        How can the World&#13;
&#13;
 Bank support these activities, for example, the&#13;
&#13;
 distribution of land, as mentioned in paragraph 23?&#13;
&#13;
           The role of indicators is another important&#13;
&#13;
 subject the paper deals with.      How difficult it is to find&#13;
&#13;
 right or useful indicators shows, as the example given in&#13;
&#13;
 paragraph 32, where the rising rate of primary enrollment&#13;
                                                                       Page30&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 does not necessarily say something about a better quality&#13;
&#13;
 of learning.    In addition, it would also be important to&#13;
&#13;
 look at the rate of dropouts after several months or even&#13;
&#13;
 years.   Otherwise, the wrong evaluation about the success&#13;
&#13;
 of the undertaken measures would be made.&#13;
&#13;
             Table 1 gives a good starting point for the&#13;
&#13;
 development of adequate indicators but again, as pointed&#13;
&#13;
 out earlier already, the design of indicators and their&#13;
&#13;
 quantification has to be country-specific.&#13;
&#13;
             To conclude my remarks on this paper, I would&#13;
&#13;
 like to give some brief answers to the issues for&#13;
&#13;
 discussion outlined in paragraph 73 at the end of the&#13;
&#13;
 paper.&#13;
&#13;
             The first point, I agree that outcome-based&#13;
&#13;
 approaches would provide a good basis for further&#13;
&#13;
 improvements in the CAS selectivity and the articulation&#13;
&#13;
 of more comprehensive and robust links between poverty&#13;
&#13;
 outcomes and Bank activities.       Developing countries should&#13;
&#13;
 design their own national plans and strategies for poverty&#13;
&#13;
 alleviation and to develop an appropriate indicator system&#13;
&#13;
 for monitoring and evaluation of the different proposed&#13;
&#13;
 measures.&#13;
                                                                   Page31&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             Secondly, I also support the second aspect to&#13;
&#13;
 promote transparency and broad participation of civil&#13;
&#13;
 society.    Let me just give one suggestion.        The close&#13;
&#13;
 relationship of poverty and gender aspects should be&#13;
&#13;
 worked out in more detail.      In the Committee of the Whole&#13;
&#13;
 paper on Tuesday we discussed the same problem for the&#13;
&#13;
 social policy already.&#13;
&#13;
             The third point concerning the third question,&#13;
&#13;
 lending support type, lending instruments appear as a&#13;
&#13;
 logical consequence of better national policies and&#13;
&#13;
 strategies for poverty alleviation, but an uncertainty&#13;
&#13;
 remains how the majority of bilateral and multilateral&#13;
&#13;
 donors are ready for it.&#13;
&#13;
             In regard to the fourth question, a gradual and&#13;
&#13;
 slow process on a case-by-case basis seems to be adequate.&#13;
&#13;
 The immediate start for a widespread introduction of the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSPs is not realistic.&#13;
&#13;
             Let me now come to the second paper,&#13;
&#13;
 "Strengthening the Link Between Debt Relief and Poverty&#13;
&#13;
 Reduction".    The paper is a clear statement by the World&#13;
&#13;
 Bank and the IMF that the debt relief initiative should&#13;
&#13;
 form a part of a comprehensive poverty alleviation&#13;
&#13;
 strategy.    Consequently, all available resources and not&#13;
                                                                 Page32&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 only those from the HIPC Initiative should be used for&#13;
&#13;
 this purpose.&#13;
&#13;
           Both organizations underline the necessity to&#13;
&#13;
 integrate sector and macroeconomic policies and, in doing&#13;
&#13;
 so, good governance becomes significant and important to&#13;
&#13;
 this broad-based concept.&#13;
&#13;
           I fully agree that poverty alleviation should be&#13;
&#13;
 seen as a long-term and multi-sectoral approach, as, for&#13;
&#13;
 example, pointed out in Box 7 on page 24.          But the paper&#13;
&#13;
 gives so far no answer to relevance and priority of the&#13;
&#13;
 various parameters for each individual country.&#13;
&#13;
           Furthermore, there is an inherent danger once we&#13;
&#13;
 try to include all the different parameters of poverty and&#13;
&#13;
 its alleviation in a cross-sectoral manner that the design&#13;
&#13;
 of strategies becomes too complex and, accordingly, rather&#13;
&#13;
 difficult for the country to efficiently implement them.&#13;
&#13;
           On the other hand, ownership and the inclusion&#13;
&#13;
 of the HIPC funds into the country's general policies for&#13;
&#13;
 poverty alleviation remains crucial.        Consequently, with&#13;
&#13;
 respect to HIPC, the outlined strategy might be somehow&#13;
&#13;
 too ambitious and on a case-by-case basis a more pragmatic&#13;
&#13;
 approach should be also taken into consideration.&#13;
                                                                    Page33&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
            The role of ownership and poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategy papers are also interlinked.         As pointed out in&#13;
&#13;
 the papers, these PRSPs are agreed upon jointly by the&#13;
&#13;
 three players -- the partner countries, the World Bank and&#13;
&#13;
 the IMF.   Hence, a lack of ownership is a prevalent danger&#13;
&#13;
 to this concept in a similar way as to the former&#13;
&#13;
 structural adjustment programs.&#13;
&#13;
            The paper further stresses on poverty funds as&#13;
&#13;
 an important instrument, as positive examples of the&#13;
&#13;
 Poverty Action Fund of Uganda is mentioned; also on a more&#13;
&#13;
 rather general basis, positive criteria for the&#13;
&#13;
 establishment for these kind of funds are transparency in&#13;
&#13;
 the allocation of resources, their fast disbursement and&#13;
&#13;
 their immediate disposal.&#13;
&#13;
            But the paper also rightly points out a&#13;
&#13;
 significant danger in relation to the experiences with&#13;
&#13;
 social funds.   These funds can become separated from the&#13;
&#13;
 general national policy and the national budget which&#13;
&#13;
 could be very detrimental to an overall approach to&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
            Therefore, more information and detailed&#13;
&#13;
 analysis of their usefulness are needed.           But let me&#13;
&#13;
 conclude by stating that in my view this paper is a very&#13;
                                                                   Page34&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 good basis for further discussions of a very complicated&#13;
&#13;
 but very important matter, but, of course, much remains to&#13;
&#13;
 be clarified and much remains to be reflection upon.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           Mr. Ako-Adjei, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. AKO-ADJEI:     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           First of all, I would like to take the three&#13;
&#13;
 papers together.   I will begin by saying I endorse the&#13;
&#13;
 outline and the policies set out in the papers, and others&#13;
&#13;
 have devoted some time to that.        So, I am not going to&#13;
&#13;
 devote any more time to that.       I would want to take what&#13;
&#13;
 Ms. Bachmayer has called challenges that are ahead of us.&#13;
&#13;
           And the first challenge I see is the&#13;
&#13;
 relationship with the Fund, because this new arrangement&#13;
&#13;
 is going to raise the level of our relationship and our&#13;
&#13;
 cooperation with the Fund to another level.         I would want&#13;
&#13;
 to sincerely request that the burden relationship that is&#13;
&#13;
 being built up here at headquarters should be extended to&#13;
&#13;
 the field, where in most of our countries the two&#13;
&#13;
 institutions are seen to be working at cross purposes most&#13;
&#13;
 of the time.&#13;
                                                                    Page35&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
            If this attitude continues or this perception&#13;
&#13;
 continues, it would completely derail the very good&#13;
&#13;
 intentions that we plan to put in place here.&#13;
&#13;
            The second point is the role of the government&#13;
&#13;
 itself.    I see more of a role at the regional and the&#13;
&#13;
 district levels where a lot of the studies are going to be&#13;
&#13;
 done, where a lot of implementation is going to be done,&#13;
&#13;
 where a lot of the operationalization of the whole poverty&#13;
&#13;
 program is going to be done.        But this is where the&#13;
&#13;
 difficulties are.&#13;
&#13;
            The central governments are weak; the districts&#13;
&#13;
 are weaker.   And I would prefer that we strengthen&#13;
&#13;
 capacity at the regions and at the districts before we&#13;
&#13;
 start throwing in money at these programs, because&#13;
&#13;
 otherwise we would end up throwing a lot of money at these&#13;
&#13;
 programs, but without institutional setup to create&#13;
&#13;
 accountability, to create transparency, to create the&#13;
&#13;
 mobilization, you need a mobilization not only of&#13;
&#13;
 resources but you need a mobilization of the people&#13;
&#13;
 involved, the poor themselves to really get into the whole&#13;
&#13;
 program.   And I think the success depends upon that&#13;
&#13;
 mobilization and what the papers call the empowerment and&#13;
                                                              Page36&#13;

                         Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 participation.   So, I urge that we pay special attention&#13;
&#13;
 to that.&#13;
&#13;
            Then, the next challenge I see really is the&#13;
&#13;
 issue of the poor themselves.      We need to build a whole&#13;
&#13;
 program around the poor themselves, around their own&#13;
&#13;
 responses, around their own interests.         We need to make&#13;
&#13;
 sure that the key resources of the poor, which is their&#13;
&#13;
 labor, is going to be utilized.       We need to create equal&#13;
&#13;
 opportunities and avenues for the poor to participate and&#13;
&#13;
 have access to all the institutional prerogatives that the&#13;
&#13;
 state creates.&#13;
&#13;
            We need to be able to create access to the&#13;
&#13;
 resources that have been channeled.        We need to create&#13;
&#13;
 access for them to generate their own incomes, to be able&#13;
&#13;
 to grow out of poverty.    I think they have to grow out of&#13;
&#13;
 poverty; we don't have to get them out of poverty.        But if&#13;
&#13;
 we provide the opportunities, the access and the&#13;
&#13;
 resources, they themselves could take the opportunities&#13;
&#13;
 and create and participate seriously for the success of&#13;
&#13;
 the program.   That is the way I see it.&#13;
&#13;
            Then the next challenge I see is with the NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
 And this is also where you are going to have to play a lot&#13;
&#13;
 at the level of the regional and the districts.        And let's&#13;
                                                                    Page37&#13;

&#13;
 accept it; I think the NGOs are better situated than both&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank and the Fund in most of the developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
 And I don't think we are going to be able to duplicate or&#13;
&#13;
 excel in a lot of areas to what the NGOs are doing.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I would urge that wherever possible, we get&#13;
&#13;
 them involved to the utmost and to the maximum.           There are&#13;
&#13;
 some of that we can work with.        There are some of them&#13;
&#13;
 that we can all work with.       Those we can all work with, we&#13;
&#13;
 leave them aside.    Those we can work with, we go along&#13;
&#13;
 with them and use the expertise.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, taking a look at donors, the role of&#13;
&#13;
 donors, that is also going to be crucial.            But the need&#13;
&#13;
 also for donors is also to strengthen coordination both at&#13;
&#13;
 the regional level, the district and at the center in our&#13;
&#13;
 countries.   And this is going to involve a bit of a spread&#13;
&#13;
 in the countries.    And if donors are going to pick and&#13;
&#13;
 choose their own pet projects and so on and there is not&#13;
&#13;
 going to be any coordination from the center, we are going&#13;
&#13;
 to have a lot of a mess.&#13;
&#13;
           And I would urge that the Bank plays a key role&#13;
&#13;
 in coordination and the donors would also see themselves&#13;
&#13;
 as an integral part of the whole program and coordinate&#13;
                                                                       Page38&#13;

&#13;
 both with the Bank and the Fund and the other donors to&#13;
&#13;
 make sure that we succeed.&#13;
&#13;
            This is a worthwhile effort, and I am sure that&#13;
&#13;
 if can galvanize the people, we can galvanize the&#13;
&#13;
 institutions, the government, the donors and the NGOs, the&#13;
&#13;
 poor themselves will grow out of poverty.&#13;

            Mr. Ghattas, please.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. GHATTAS:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
            Before we convened, Mr. Page asked me to be&#13;
&#13;
 briefed.   As one of my former bosses, I better listen to&#13;
&#13;
 him.&#13;
&#13;
            I will, therefore, discuss the two papers,&#13;
&#13;
 "Building Poverty Reduction Strategies in Developing&#13;
&#13;
 Countries" and "Social and Structural Reviews", focusing&#13;
&#13;
 mainly on the former.     But I will refer to the IMF paper&#13;
&#13;
 as well.&#13;
&#13;
            We have had a very useful and informative&#13;
&#13;
 bilateral discussion with staff.       I can, therefore, be&#13;
&#13;
 selective in my comments.&#13;
&#13;
            We can support the comprehensive framework for&#13;
&#13;
 reducing poverty as underpinned by the three elements -- a&#13;

&#13;
 thorough understanding of poverty and its determinants;&#13;
&#13;
 choosing public actions that have the highest poverty&#13;
&#13;
 impact; and participatory setting of targets and&#13;
&#13;
 monitoring outcome indicators.&#13;
&#13;
           This framework seems to build on the experience&#13;
&#13;
 with the approach outlined in the 1993 Poverty Reduction&#13;
&#13;
 Handbook by utilizing new knowledge and lending&#13;
&#13;
 instruments.   The international development goals for 2015&#13;
&#13;
 that the proposed framework is designed to achieve are&#13;
&#13;
 very ambitious.   The Bank, as well as other donors, needs&#13;
&#13;
 to be modest and realistic in applying the framework.&#13;
&#13;
           Nonetheless, it is perhaps better to sets one&#13;
&#13;
 sight in fighting poverty too high than too low.      The&#13;
&#13;
 framework needs to be applied flexibly and be tailored to&#13;
&#13;
 the country circumstances.     How we proceed in an&#13;
&#13;
 individual country will depend on the initial conditions.&#13;
&#13;
 Where we want to end by 2015 will also depend on&#13;
&#13;
 government ownership, resource availability and&#13;
&#13;
 institutional capacities.&#13;
&#13;
           In this regard, the paper broadly states that&#13;
&#13;
 there is a potential tradeoff between external assistance&#13;
&#13;
 to expedite the process and ultimate ownership.       This&#13;
&#13;
 seems to be a fact that is often ignored when we announced&#13;
                                                               Page40&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 that the government should always be in the driver's seat.&#13;
&#13;
 This tradeoff or tension could slow down progress towards&#13;
&#13;
 achieving the international development goals.&#13;
&#13;
           Implementation of the proposed framework puts&#13;
&#13;
 pressure on the Bank to deliver.       It also has operational&#13;
&#13;
 and perhaps organizational implications to the Bank that&#13;
&#13;
 the paper does not adequately discuss.         I can think of two&#13;
&#13;
 aspects related to this.&#13;
&#13;
           First, the challenge of making units and staff&#13;
&#13;
 move from sectoral-based analysis and interventions to an&#13;
&#13;
 overall framework centered on poverty outcomes.        Staff may&#13;
&#13;
 want to explain how we can make this change across the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank.&#13;
&#13;
           The second is Bank collaboration with the IMF.&#13;
&#13;
 The proposed poverty strategy paper that could replace the&#13;
&#13;
 PFP will put additional pressure on the Bank to deliver.&#13;
&#13;
 The IMF paper states in a number of places that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 is sometimes unable to provide social policy analysis on a&#13;
&#13;
 timely basis because of either staff resource constraints&#13;
&#13;
 or mismatched Bank-Fund work cycles.        The paper goes on to&#13;
&#13;
 pose the question to the IMF Directors whether they think&#13;
&#13;
 that the IMF should increase staff resources and hire new&#13;
&#13;
 specialized staff to meet the needs.        In fact, some units&#13;
                                                                     Page41&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 may have already started hiring specialized staff.          Of&#13;
&#13;
 course, poverty reduction, if it is not already, should be&#13;
&#13;
 the bread and butter of the bank.        Inability to deliver&#13;
&#13;
 should be a major concern for management.&#13;
&#13;
             I have two more technical points on the poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction paper.    First, the paper seems to put too much&#13;
&#13;
 emphasis on slow growth as a major cause of poverty.          My&#13;
&#13;
 understanding is that growth policies are very effective&#13;
&#13;
 when the income distribution is fairly egalitarian.          But&#13;
&#13;
 when the income distribution is highly skewed,&#13;
&#13;
 redistribution policies are more effective.         This&#13;
&#13;
 highlights the importance of understanding and starting&#13;
&#13;
 with the initial conditions in the country.&#13;
&#13;
             My second technical point concerns the use of&#13;
&#13;
 poverty lines.    It is always preferable to use a range of&#13;
&#13;
 poverty lines and measures that capture the depth and&#13;
&#13;
 severity of poverty as opposed to using a single poverty&#13;
&#13;
 line.   These will indicate how many households or&#13;
&#13;
 individuals hover around the poverty line and whether the&#13;
&#13;
 profile of poverty changes with different lines.           This is&#13;
&#13;
 extremely important for policy and for the design of&#13;
&#13;
 projects.&#13;
                                                                      Page42&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             It is possible that with this kind of approach,&#13;
&#13;
 we would not have been, quote, "unprepared for the&#13;
&#13;
 dimensions of the social crisis in Asia".&#13;
&#13;
             Mr. Chairman, I have the following final comment&#13;
&#13;
 on the social and structural reviews.          If delivered, as&#13;
&#13;
 indicated in Annex Table 1, we would have made good&#13;
&#13;
 progress on completing these papers for the pilot&#13;
&#13;
 countries.    By then, we would have acquired sufficient&#13;
&#13;
 experience to evaluate whether we should move forward from&#13;
&#13;
 the pilot phase to broader implementation.&#13;
&#13;
             This is not specifically discussed in the paper,&#13;
&#13;
 and we should return to the subject at an opportune time.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
             MR. ALVAREZ:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
             Let me first acknowledge staff for very&#13;
&#13;
 comprehensive papers, especially the HIPC one.         Without&#13;
&#13;
 diminishing the importance of the earlier two papers, we&#13;
&#13;
 would like to concentrate our comments on the HIPC one,&#13;
&#13;
 given that it is a very good analysis of the different&#13;
&#13;
 approaches being used to tackle poverty to targeted&#13;
&#13;
 programs.&#13;
                                                                   Page43&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             In general, we found that the paper is well-&#13;
&#13;
 balanced, making use of good policy analysis, while&#13;
&#13;
 blending the views of many interested parties.      Trying to&#13;
&#13;
 accommodate different, often conflicting, views is a&#13;
&#13;
 difficult task and staff of both institutions should be&#13;
&#13;
 commended for their efforts.&#13;
&#13;
             The first point that caught our attention in the&#13;
&#13;
 paper is the recognition by staff that increasing budget&#13;
&#13;
 spending along may not have effect in poverty programmed&#13;
&#13;
 outcomes.    This recognition is important for at least two&#13;
&#13;
 reasons, both of which we have mentioned in different HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 discussions.&#13;
&#13;
             The first one has to do with efficiency and&#13;
&#13;
 public expenditure.    Increases in budget expenditure alone&#13;
&#13;
 should not be taken as a measure for commitment to poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction, much less as an indicator of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 alleviation.    It is important to remember that in some&#13;
&#13;
 cases HIPC assistance will provide just for breathing&#13;
&#13;
 space to pay external commitment; thus, the effect on&#13;
&#13;
 spending should not be expected.&#13;
&#13;
             Furthermore, in a country with a weak delivery&#13;
&#13;
 system of social services, an increasing expenditure for&#13;
&#13;
 social services would create wasteful programs.     One can&#13;
                                                                 Page44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 always argue, as several commentators did, an&#13;
&#13;
 institutional capacity needs to be strengthened.     But&#13;
&#13;
 capacity building for service delivery does not guarantee&#13;
&#13;
 efficient outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
           Educational outcomes in areas with among the&#13;
&#13;
 best teacher training, salaries, infrastructure and&#13;
&#13;
 equipment in the world are comparable with those countries&#13;
&#13;
 that spend much less.&#13;
&#13;
           A second reason why budget expenditure alone is&#13;
&#13;
 misleading has to do with individual's spending patterns,&#13;
&#13;
 patterns that could greatly affect the efficiency of&#13;
&#13;
 providing social services.     If a country, due to debt&#13;
&#13;
 relief scheme, allows their citizens to use more&#13;
&#13;
 disposable income to purchase social services that affect&#13;
&#13;
 poverty indicators, then poverty alleviation could take&#13;
&#13;
 place.&#13;
&#13;
           Regardless of spending levels, one might find&#13;
&#13;
 outcomes of providing service more efficient in some&#13;
&#13;
 societies more than in others.      Outcome could be closer&#13;
&#13;
 linked to the competitive environment under which services&#13;
&#13;
 are provided.   One suggestion to staff, while another is&#13;
&#13;
 in poverty, is to consider social services being financed&#13;
&#13;
 and provided by both the public and private sectors.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             Staff could expand on the role of private sector&#13;
&#13;
 provision of social services, especially in light of the&#13;
&#13;
 part that delivery capacity in HIPC countries could be&#13;
&#13;
 weak.&#13;
&#13;
             To follow up on the point Mr. Fallon made this&#13;
&#13;
 morning about the impact of poverty and poverty that&#13;
&#13;
 access to water may have, we could only add that recent&#13;
&#13;
 research by Bank staff points out the desirability of&#13;
&#13;
 deregulated private provision of services in that sector.&#13;
&#13;
             We are of the opinion that, at this point in&#13;
&#13;
 time, no option should be disregarded.&#13;
&#13;
             The Bank presented results of poverty funds,&#13;
&#13;
 Section 47, being used to target poverty.           The paper&#13;
&#13;
 identifies several shortcoming of such funds in reaching&#13;
&#13;
 the poor.    While mentioning the shortcomings of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 funds in some developing countries, the paper disappoints&#13;
&#13;
 us for not revealing similar problems with poverty funds&#13;
&#13;
 in industrialized countries.&#13;
&#13;
             By extending the analysis to identify&#13;
&#13;
 shortcomings of poverty programs, two experiences in&#13;
&#13;
 industrialized countries, one could get generalization for&#13;
&#13;
 such type of programs, thus avoiding the perception that&#13;
&#13;
 if we correct this or by improving in some areas, like,&#13;
                                                                 Page46&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 for example, capacity building, one may get efficient&#13;
&#13;
 outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
             Competition in the provision of public services,&#13;
&#13;
 as well as consumer empowerment in the selection of&#13;
&#13;
 providers, could have a great impact in poverty service&#13;
&#13;
 outputs.    Staff should be mindful of the proposals that&#13;
&#13;
 limit competition for the provision of social services,&#13;
&#13;
 and in that respect we are glad that, although many&#13;
&#13;
 commentators brought up such approaches, they were&#13;
&#13;
 somewhat disregarded.&#13;
&#13;
             Another point worth mentioning again has to do&#13;
&#13;
 with representation in the policy formulation process.&#13;
&#13;
 Like increases in budget expenditure, increases in the&#13;
&#13;
 number of entities that participate in the political&#13;
&#13;
 dialogue do not guarantee ownership or the desired&#13;
&#13;
 reforms.    Representation is something that has to be&#13;
&#13;
 defined within the political process of each individual&#13;
&#13;
 HIPC country.    Like in all areas, an appropriate measure&#13;
&#13;
 should be identified for each desired outcome.&#13;
&#13;
             To the extent that the desired outcome is a wide&#13;
&#13;
 participatory process, the matrix to evaluate performance&#13;
&#13;
 has to be chosen according to it.        If we are monitoring&#13;
&#13;
 process, let us measure it.&#13;
                                                                 Page47&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           The proposal for improving debt management in&#13;
&#13;
 HIPC countries is a good.     Recommendation along the lines&#13;
&#13;
 of improving accountability and transparency should be&#13;
&#13;
 properly assessed.   The World Bank started technical&#13;
&#13;
 assistance work recently in this area.         This work, along&#13;
&#13;
 with the work being performed by other institutions, would&#13;
&#13;
 enhance management capability in borrowing countries.&#13;
&#13;
           The literature is reaching and analyzing the&#13;
&#13;
 role of different actors in the budget process, including&#13;
&#13;
 parliaments and interest groups.       The Bank and the Fund&#13;
&#13;
 should be mindful of such analysis and should weigh the&#13;
&#13;
 pros and cons the proposals that could work against the&#13;
&#13;
 aim for economic reforms that could bring sustainable&#13;
&#13;
 growth to HIPC countries.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, going back to the other two papers, in&#13;
&#13;
 our opinion they focus on the traditional poor.         Recent&#13;
&#13;
 research of the Bank has presented a clear link between&#13;
&#13;
 poverty and lack of access to employment.          This lack of&#13;
&#13;
 access to employment is limited to the traditional poor or&#13;
&#13;
 limits access to the traditional poor and to the new poor.&#13;
&#13;
 We think the Bank in a revision paper should properly&#13;
&#13;
 reflect the analysis that the Bank has performed.&#13;
                                                                   Page48&#13;

&#13;
           In summing up, we can go along with most of the&#13;
&#13;
 questions posed by staff, but in echoing Mr. Schaffer we&#13;
&#13;
 think that each country deserves case-by-case attention,&#13;
&#13;
 taking into consideration the points that were mentioned.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:     Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           John Sinclair, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SINCLAIR:     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           I think we found these papers very&#13;
&#13;
 comprehensive, thoughtful and sensitive.            In fact, I think&#13;
&#13;
 together they serve as a key set of stepping stones&#13;
&#13;
 towards a very different sense of priority for the poor in&#13;
&#13;
 all of our work.   They represent a critical coming&#13;
&#13;
 together of the Bretton Woods institutions, and I know&#13;
&#13;
 that is happening all the time.        But I think, most&#13;
&#13;
 importantly, they demand a sustained operational level of&#13;
&#13;
 collaboration between those institutions.&#13;
&#13;
           And picking up my Ghanaian colleague's&#13;
&#13;
 challenge, I think that is going to be a very, very&#13;
&#13;
 difficult and very important dimension of this work,&#13;
&#13;
 especially bringing the client government to the center of&#13;
&#13;
 that process.&#13;
                                                                        Page49&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           We agree that any new poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 framework needs to be rooted in the four elements that are&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned -- broad-based participatory process; improved&#13;
&#13;
 transparency and accountability for government -- and I&#13;
&#13;
 think in that dimension I would mention the desirability&#13;
&#13;
 of greater efforts of monitoring and analyzing some of the&#13;
&#13;
 extra budgetary spending elements that sometimes confuse&#13;
&#13;
 our interpretations of that level -- most fundamentally,&#13;
&#13;
 the understanding that poverty is indeed a multi-&#13;
&#13;
 dimensional phenomenon, that it is not just something&#13;
&#13;
 about income; and finally, that there is a reminder that&#13;
&#13;
 sustained poverty reduction is impossible for sure without&#13;
&#13;
 quality economic growth, but also that trickle-down is&#13;
&#13;
 rarely enough.&#13;
&#13;
           Implicitly, I think we are reconfirming that&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction should be the new underpinning, not of a&#13;
&#13;
 few but, of all of our interventions.         Under the enhanced&#13;
&#13;
 HIPC paper in front of us, we are adding debt relief to&#13;
&#13;
 that list of supportive instruments.        I think in the&#13;
&#13;
 vocabulary CDF, we are again seeing the interplay between&#13;
&#13;
 the social and the economic in an organic whole.&#13;
&#13;
           I think the Bank paper sees these new poverty&#13;
&#13;
 goals being mobilized around an instrument called the&#13;
                                                                    Page50&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction strategy paper.         And in that light, I&#13;
&#13;
 would add some words my Director reminded me to mention&#13;
&#13;
 that her sincere hope is that this will be one paper that&#13;
&#13;
 we know by its title rather than by an acronym, especially&#13;
&#13;
 since the acronym is hard to pronounce.&#13;
&#13;
           I think we support that poverty strategy and its&#13;
&#13;
 proposed role as the core instrument for assessing&#13;
&#13;
 eligibility under the enhanced HIPC.          I already mentioned&#13;
&#13;
 some of the key elements we saw as important to the&#13;
&#13;
 poverty strategy.    I would add that, as drafted, it is&#13;
&#13;
 rather thin on implicit concerns for gender and the&#13;
&#13;
 environment.&#13;
&#13;
           I think we agree very strongly that the&#13;
&#13;
 insistence that ownership is crucial is a correct one.&#13;
&#13;
 Any meaningful poverty strategy has to be home-grown.&#13;
&#13;
           As others have mentioned, the preparation of&#13;
&#13;
 these strategies are going to be complex and demanding&#13;
&#13;
 and, in that context, I think we will need to finesse the&#13;
&#13;
 situation where the addition of this focus for HIPC could&#13;
&#13;
 be seen, especially in its early days, not as a new burden&#13;
&#13;
 of conditionality for the countries concerns, a new set of&#13;
&#13;
 goal posts which have moved.        We would rather like to see&#13;
                                                                     Page51&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction as replacing, not adding to, some&#13;
&#13;
 conditionalities.&#13;
&#13;
             In that sense, especially for the existing&#13;
&#13;
 HIPCs, we may need process-type targets, are they putting&#13;
&#13;
 place an effective poverty strategy.&#13;
&#13;
             Realistically, key to the longer term, we don't&#13;
&#13;
 expect poverty outcome indicators to be available&#13;
&#13;
 meaningfully in the first two or three years of new HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 decisions.    I think we would be intrigued to understand&#13;
&#13;
 how staff see these early cases being handled.        I think we&#13;
&#13;
 had a little bit of an impression of that at the beginning&#13;
&#13;
 but it may be useful to reconfirm that.&#13;
&#13;
             Most importantly, whether within a HIPC or just&#13;
&#13;
 as a new normal IDA activity, the existence of a poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategy should radically change the rules of&#13;
&#13;
 the game.    For sure, they will crucially become central&#13;
&#13;
 elements within a CDF scenario.         Their thinking should be&#13;
&#13;
 a central influence on a CAS.        Indeed, one would hope and&#13;
&#13;
 assume that their consultative processes would largely&#13;
&#13;
 overlap and flow into the CG process.&#13;
&#13;
             We assume that the poverty strategy will become&#13;
&#13;
 a central feature of the new guidance to CAS authors, that&#13;
&#13;
 we heard being mentioned a couple of days ago before.        And&#13;
                                                                    Page52&#13;

&#13;
 I suppose in the context of Question 3, we certainly would&#13;
&#13;
 support a steady expansion of the range of countries being&#13;
&#13;
 covered.&#13;
&#13;
            I must also assume that the same strategies will&#13;
&#13;
 significantly condition the framework of an ESAF.       And I&#13;
&#13;
 think this is clearly the challenge for our colleagues&#13;
&#13;
 across the street in recognizing that future fiscal&#13;
&#13;
 framework recommendations should proactively seek to leave&#13;
&#13;
 space for pro-poor for social expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
            The Trican [phonetic] surveys used in Uganda&#13;
&#13;
 would seem to be an important and useful monitoring&#13;
&#13;
 mechanism.    And, as my Irish colleagues have suggested,&#13;
&#13;
 there could be much merit in protecting core social&#13;
&#13;
 expenditures via the concept of ring-fencing in budgetary&#13;
&#13;
 frameworks.&#13;
&#13;
            Conceptually, we favor the outcome focus&#13;
&#13;
 thinking of the poverty strategy.        However, I think we&#13;
&#13;
 would have to caution against false expectations.       We were&#13;
&#13;
 only discussing yesterday the realities in the Strategic&#13;
&#13;
 Compact that output targets are very hard to define and,&#13;
&#13;
 at best, have been now embodied in the CAS frameworks&#13;
&#13;
 themselves.   I think we will have to rely more on&#13;
&#13;
 intermediates and encourage governments and countries to&#13;
                                                                   Page53&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 align their national goals around the framework of the key&#13;
&#13;
 international development goals.&#13;
&#13;
            In that spirit, the Bank and other donors will&#13;
&#13;
 need to stand ready to support capacity building in those&#13;
&#13;
 areas, in data collection, enhanced budgetary design, in&#13;
&#13;
 many dimensions, as others have mentioned.&#13;
&#13;
            I think on the positive side of an outcomes&#13;
&#13;
 discussion, we would hope that the strategy is intimately&#13;
&#13;
 linked and quickly linked in the CAS or the CDF or&#13;
&#13;
 whatever to an action plan.     I think we need very clear to&#13;
&#13;
 see this as something related to the whole programmatic&#13;
&#13;
 process.&#13;
&#13;
            A word of caution:    We see all this process as&#13;
&#13;
 part of a master plan, a well-conceived master plan,&#13;
&#13;
 hopefully to take poverty reduction to the heart of the&#13;
&#13;
 development process.   And in that spirit, just as our&#13;
&#13;
 Nordic colleagues alluded to, I think we are a little&#13;
&#13;
 worried that the idea of a stand-alone poverty note, even&#13;
&#13;
 if it is a CAS annex, will have the spirit of an&#13;
&#13;
 independent perspective.&#13;
&#13;
            I think we would rather see the mind set goal&#13;
&#13;
 being one of making the CAS into a totally holistic&#13;
&#13;
 document and, in that sense, at least for poverty&#13;
                                                                 Page54&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 mainstreaming, it should be mandatory, rather than an&#13;
&#13;
 annex poverty note.&#13;
&#13;
           We were talking briefly yesterday about a&#13;
&#13;
 version of question of proliferation, which I thought was&#13;
&#13;
 supposed to end with the Cold War.        However, I think we&#13;
&#13;
 are seeing it still today, not in the military sense.       We&#13;
&#13;
 are seeing it in terms of the numbers of documentations,&#13;
&#13;
 the different sort of approaches we have to these agendas.&#13;
&#13;
           We have SSRs, rightly complaining that some ESW&#13;
&#13;
 building blocks were missing.      We have encouraged a new&#13;
&#13;
 generation of participatory PERs.       I was at a presentation&#13;
&#13;
 in which I learned a great deal about NIRs, and they&#13;
&#13;
 seemed very, very important also.       And just a few weeks&#13;
&#13;
 ago, we were in a room and we were talking about PSLs and&#13;
&#13;
 PAPs, though I understand PAPs was considered to be a&#13;
&#13;
 little offensive as an acronym.&#13;
&#13;
           All in all, I think these could be worthy&#13;
&#13;
 elements in an evolution of a sound poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategy, but I think they also risk the potentiality of&#13;
&#13;
 being like those mysterious disconnected files we get&#13;
&#13;
 warned about as cluttering our hard drives.        And I suppose&#13;
&#13;
 we would put in a small quiet plea for some consolidation.&#13;
                                                                    Page55&#13;

&#13;
           I think we are moving the pieces together, but&#13;
&#13;
 let's not, in a sense, have too much dispersal of that&#13;
&#13;
 energy.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, to conclude then, I think we would have&#13;
&#13;
 to say we very strongly welcome these efforts to add flesh&#13;
&#13;
 and bones to the commitment of poverty reduction that is&#13;
&#13;
 at the heart of this institution's mandate.        It is, in a&#13;
&#13;
 sense, very, very appropriate that the chosen instrument,&#13;
&#13;
 the poverty strategy, will also be a critical bridge to&#13;
&#13;
 strengthen in the work on the HIPC and our relationship&#13;
&#13;
 with the Fund across the way.&#13;
&#13;

           MR. HYDEN:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           I join with other Directors in welcoming these&#13;
&#13;
 papers and the framework that they present.        This is a&#13;
&#13;
 marked advance, perhaps even an historic one, and we very&#13;
&#13;
 warmly support it, and support the broad elements that are&#13;
&#13;
 in it.&#13;
&#13;
           I wanted really just to take up two points or&#13;
&#13;
 two issues at this stage.     One links to the point that Mr.&#13;
&#13;
 Sinclair was just making about the burdens that are placed&#13;
                                                                  Page56&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 on countries in trying to meet all of our requirements,&#13;
&#13;
 and the variety of forms and reports and whatever they&#13;
&#13;
 have to fill in.&#13;
&#13;
           Many of our countries don't have capacity to put&#13;
&#13;
 huge resources into these sorts of exercises, and that&#13;
&#13;
 applies certainly to some of my constituents.        So,&#13;
&#13;
 consolidation will clearly help.&#13;
&#13;
           But even so, the requirements we are putting on&#13;
&#13;
 them is formidable.    My advice to them in those&#13;
&#13;
 circumstances, when they ask, well, if we cannot do the&#13;
&#13;
 whole job, which bit is most important, I think the most&#13;
&#13;
 important bit is the framework; that is, the broad&#13;
&#13;
 elements that are set out here of identifying the national&#13;
&#13;
 objectives, of the country itself having ownership of&#13;
&#13;
 that, of identifying the means and options for pursuing&#13;
&#13;
 those objectives, having some measurement of outcome,&#13;
&#13;
 coordination of the efforts between the various supporters&#13;
&#13;
 and donors.&#13;
&#13;
           So, the key elements of this framework are&#13;
&#13;
 really the most important elements.         The detail of how it&#13;
&#13;
 is implemented I think can be done flexibly and tailored&#13;
&#13;
 to the circumstances of individual countries.&#13;
                                                                    Page57&#13;

&#13;
            If they get the questions right, then it is much&#13;
&#13;
 easier to get the answers right, even if you don't have&#13;
&#13;
 such sophisticated analyses and report writing as we would&#13;
&#13;
 like.&#13;
&#13;
            The second question I would like to refer to is&#13;
&#13;
 the treatment of governance and empowerment in the papers.&#13;
&#13;
 Governance is very important.       We discussed this with the&#13;
&#13;
 President last night at our dinner, and he made the point&#13;
&#13;
 that governance was central to almost all things that&#13;
&#13;
 countries were trying to do.       If you don't have good&#13;
&#13;
 governance, then it is pretty hard to have good economic&#13;
&#13;
 performance, if the budget doesn't operate, if monetary&#13;
&#13;
 policy doesn't operate, if the court systems don't&#13;
&#13;
 operate.&#13;
&#13;
            Yet, in the frameworks we are presented with,&#13;
&#13;
 governance is not seen as something which affects&#13;
&#13;
 everything.   It is put into a category of its own.     In the&#13;
&#13;
 paper on "Building Poverty Reduction Strategies", in Table&#13;
&#13;
 1 on page 9, we see that good governance is linked to the&#13;
&#13;
 objective of empowerment and participation in decision-&#13;
&#13;
 making.    But it is really much more than that.    It relates&#13;
&#13;
 also to economic opportunities; it relates to the heading&#13;
                                                                  Page58&#13;

&#13;
 of capabilities, of literacy, education, health; it&#13;
&#13;
 relates to security.&#13;
&#13;
           One example:   In one of the countries I&#13;
&#13;
 represent, teachers have not been paid for six months.       It&#13;
&#13;
 is because of a breakdown in governance in the central&#13;
&#13;
 government.   It is not an isolated example.&#13;
&#13;
           Infrastructure programs, capital works programs,&#13;
&#13;
 also completely chaotic because of inadequate governance.&#13;
&#13;
 So, unless governance is dealt with as a central concern,&#13;
&#13;
 most of these other objectives are so much more difficult&#13;
&#13;
 to achieve.&#13;
&#13;
           If, as in this table, we link good governance to&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment, we risk downgrading it to something,&#13;
&#13;
 something which is less important than economic growth,&#13;
&#13;
 less important than education and health, less important&#13;
&#13;
 than security.&#13;
&#13;
           In many countries, empowerment I think is&#13;
&#13;
 something which is not so readily endorsed as an objective&#13;
&#13;
 as some of the other objectives of this strategy --&#13;
&#13;
 economic growth, education, social objectives.     That is&#13;
&#13;
 because empowerment takes countries into difficult&#13;
&#13;
 questions of representative arrangements, parliamentary&#13;
&#13;
 processes, public dialogue, and one can understand why&#13;
                                                                   Page59&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 many countries need to tailor what they do to their&#13;
&#13;
 capacities and circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
            I, therefore, am concerned that if we link&#13;
&#13;
 governance to an empowerment objective, we are in danger&#13;
&#13;
 of seeing it given inadequate attention because of the&#13;
&#13;
 reservations that some countries will inevitably attach to&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment as an objective as such.        And if we are giving&#13;
&#13;
 countries ownership and we believe in that, then we have&#13;
&#13;
 to follow their preferences.&#13;
&#13;
            In the paper on HIPC and "Strengthening the Link&#13;
&#13;
 Between Debt Relief and Poverty Reduction", the comparable&#13;
&#13;
 table, which is Box 7 on page 27, treats the issues&#13;
&#13;
 differently.   There is no reference there to empowerment&#13;
&#13;
 as such.   The heading becomes transparency, accountability&#13;
&#13;
 and budget management, which is clearly a subsector of&#13;
&#13;
 good governance but it is not all of good governance.&#13;
&#13;
            So, this area I think needs some closer&#13;
&#13;
 attention.   I would like to see good governance made as a&#13;
&#13;
 separate heading, probably a chapeau across the top that&#13;
&#13;
 applies to all.   One can keep the section on empowerment&#13;
&#13;
 and perhaps attach to that the issues relating to&#13;
&#13;
 participation, participatory processes, information and&#13;
                                                                    Page60&#13;

&#13;
 public dialogue.   So, it is still there, but it doesn't&#13;
&#13;
 compete with good governance.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:     Thank you very much, Neil.&#13;
&#13;
           Jean Pesme, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. PESME:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           I would also like to commend the IMF and Bank&#13;
&#13;
 staff for these very impressive pieces of paper.         I must&#13;
&#13;
 say it is sometimes difficult to comment on them because&#13;
&#13;
 they are very comprehensive and well reflect the&#13;
&#13;
 complexity of the issue, which also means that when we&#13;
&#13;
 come to make them operational, it may be quite tricky&#13;
&#13;
 because we will have to lose part of this complexity to&#13;
&#13;
 make sure that we are doing something.          But I will come&#13;
&#13;
 back on that later.&#13;
&#13;
           On the substance, we are in global agreement&#13;
&#13;
 with the main thrust of all the papers and we welcome the&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity taken to somehow scale up the commitment of&#13;
&#13;
 the two institutions to fight against poverty at the&#13;
&#13;
 occasion of this momentum linked to the HIPC Initiative.&#13;
&#13;
           I agree with Bassary Toure that nothing is&#13;
&#13;
 really new, but we understand the proposal of the&#13;
&#13;
 framework as a way to try to rationalize and be more&#13;
                                                                   Page61&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 systematic in our approach for poverty alleviation.       And&#13;
&#13;
 we very much appreciate this proposal from this&#13;
&#13;
 standpoint.&#13;
&#13;
           Now some features of the proposal we would like&#13;
&#13;
 to particularly welcome.    The first one is the strong&#13;
&#13;
 interlinkage between growth and social progress and the&#13;
&#13;
 emphasis on distribution of growth.        And we think it is a&#13;
&#13;
 very important part of the proposal.&#13;
&#13;
           The second one is that placing poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 at the center of our involvement must be a criteria for&#13;
&#13;
 selectivity.   And the fact that we have been able to try&#13;
&#13;
 to tackle with all the issues why putting selectivity at&#13;
&#13;
 the forefront is very important.&#13;
&#13;
           The proposal to add a long-term and multi-&#13;
&#13;
 sectoral approach is also very welcomed, as well as the&#13;
&#13;
 efforts not to remain only in the HIPC context but to&#13;
&#13;
 broaden the approach.&#13;
&#13;
           This being said, there are three points on which&#13;
&#13;
 we will pay attention.    The first one is that this&#13;
&#13;
 approach should not undermine the macroeconomic&#13;
&#13;
 conditionality of IMF programs, in particular in the HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 context, which means that sometimes we will have make some&#13;
&#13;
 balance and make more explicit some of the social&#13;
                                                                   Page62&#13;

                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 consequences of this macroeconomic program, which is very&#13;
&#13;
 welcome, but not at the expense of the core issues of the&#13;
&#13;
 IMF program.&#13;
&#13;
           The second point is that strong political will&#13;
&#13;
 from the authorities of the beneficiary countries will be&#13;
&#13;
 very important in the implementation.         And this approach&#13;
&#13;
 should not only be Bank and IMF approach but really have a&#13;
&#13;
 sense of ownership, not in the country in general -- I&#13;
&#13;
 will come back on the participatory process -- but at&#13;
&#13;
 really the political level in these countries.&#13;
&#13;
           The third issue relates to what has just been&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned by Mr. Hyden on governance.         I would just add to&#13;
&#13;
 that, that the more we are going towards a multi-&#13;
&#13;
 dimensional approach, assessment of outcomes, et cetera,&#13;
&#13;
 the more necessary it will be to make sure that we know&#13;
&#13;
 exactly what is the use of the resources we are providing,&#13;
&#13;
 that accountability and transparency is there.        So, we&#13;
&#13;
 must pay great attention to that, so that we know at each&#13;
&#13;
 stage what is going on.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, on the methodology which is proposed, we&#13;
&#13;
 agree with what we see as three key elements -- the&#13;
&#13;
 emphasis on determinants of poverty; selectivity in the&#13;
&#13;
 choice of public action; and the focus on outcome&#13;
                                                                     Page63&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 indicators, both in the context of the international&#13;
&#13;
 development targets and having some short and medium-term&#13;
&#13;
 intermediate objectives.&#13;
&#13;
            Once more, it is not fully revolutionary and it&#13;
&#13;
 has proved in the past to be a robust approach, but what&#13;
&#13;
 we very much appreciate is the fact that it is now&#13;
&#13;
 systematic and we expect this to be put in place very&#13;
&#13;
 quickly.&#13;
&#13;
            But, as mentioned by several other speakers, it&#13;
&#13;
 should not become a straitjacket, and we will have to have&#13;
&#13;
 the right balance between a country-by-country approach&#13;
&#13;
 and also, which will be very important in the HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 context, I think appropriate fairness between the&#13;
&#13;
 countries, which sometimes might be very difficult.&#13;
&#13;
            But we think case-by-case, yes, but making sure&#13;
&#13;
 that across-the-board we will treat every country the same&#13;
&#13;
 way.   That is something I will come back on a bit later on&#13;
&#13;
 Nicaragua.&#13;
&#13;
            The second point in this process is being&#13;
&#13;
 careful -- it has been mentioned by other speakers -- on&#13;
&#13;
 the participatory process.     Each country has somehow its&#13;
&#13;
 own political economy, and we must make sure that the way&#13;
&#13;
 that we will be discussing with the country will be fully&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 taken into account.   And there are some representative&#13;
&#13;
 bodies.   There are now processes of legitimacy in each&#13;
&#13;
 country, to which we will have to pay attention and in&#13;
&#13;
 which we would have to fit our approach.&#13;
&#13;
           We must remain very careful not to convey a kind&#13;
&#13;
 of across-the-board participatory process.         This will be,&#13;
&#13;
 in our view, a very important condition for ownership but&#13;
&#13;
 also for this very strong political involvement at the&#13;
&#13;
 highest level, so that everybody in each country will be&#13;
&#13;
 committed to the poverty reduction strategies.&#13;
&#13;
           On implementation, there are three levels of&#13;
&#13;
 challenges on implementation, and somehow at this stage we&#13;
&#13;
 are still with a very general framework and we will need&#13;
&#13;
 to know more on what it means operationally.&#13;
&#13;
           At the country level, I want to come back on&#13;
&#13;
 what has been said the capacity building, the difficulty&#13;
&#13;
 with statistical issues when defining the intermediary&#13;
&#13;
 outcomes, and just to take the table which is in the annex&#13;
&#13;
 of the paper, there are some figures which show that we&#13;
&#13;
 may have big holes in our assessment of what is going on&#13;
&#13;
 in many of the HIPC countries, in particular.&#13;
&#13;
           But it also means that we will have&#13;
&#13;
 implementation challenges at the Bank level.        I won't come&#13;
                                                                    Page65&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 back on the discussion we have had some months ago on the&#13;
&#13;
 poverty progress report, which has shown that, yes, we&#13;
&#13;
 have made progress but, on the other hand, doing it on a&#13;
&#13;
 day-by-day basis and making sure that each country team is&#13;
&#13;
 fully involved in that process and really puts that at the&#13;
&#13;
 forefront, at the center of the relationship with the&#13;
&#13;
 country is not always very easy.&#13;
&#13;
           I am not sure that we currently have all the&#13;
&#13;
 skills to put in place the proposed framework and, in&#13;
&#13;
 particular, this attention to political economy in each&#13;
&#13;
 country, that we have the skills to assess poverty in all&#13;
&#13;
 its dimensions.   We had a discussion some time ago on the&#13;
&#13;
 urban strategy which shows that we were weak on that side.&#13;
&#13;
           So, the question of also scaling up our&#13;
&#13;
 mobilization of internal skills and resources will be very&#13;
&#13;
 important in the way we implement the proposed framework.&#13;
&#13;
           But another important issue of implementation&#13;
&#13;
 would be the way we present it towards outside&#13;
&#13;
 stakeholders.   We fully concur with staff that the impact&#13;
&#13;
 of our involvement in poverty reduction will have to be&#13;
&#13;
 assessed on the long-term, but there are very strong&#13;
&#13;
 expectations, in particular in the HIPC context, in the&#13;
&#13;
 shorter term.   So, the way we balance that will be very&#13;
                                                              Page66&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 important, and we must be very clear on how actually our&#13;
&#13;
 involvement in the HIPC context will demonstrate that we&#13;
&#13;
 are focused on poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           On implementation, John Sinclair was very&#13;
&#13;
 eloquent in coming back to all the acronyms.        Making sure&#13;
&#13;
 that somehow we aggregate all of our assessments, papers,&#13;
&#13;
 et cetera will be very important in clarifying what is&#13;
&#13;
 center to our dialogue with the countries.         And so far the&#13;
&#13;
 way the link would be made between these poverty programs&#13;
&#13;
 and the CASs or the CDF, where the CDF is tested, is not&#13;
&#13;
 very clear, in our view.    And maybe this will be part of&#13;
&#13;
 the upcoming discussion for the Annual Meetings on&#13;
&#13;
 implementation.&#13;
&#13;
           One point more specific to the HIPC context.        We&#13;
&#13;
 believe that these poverty reduction programs must be&#13;
&#13;
 linked with the decision point.       And somehow we will have&#13;
&#13;
 to balance the willingness to accelerate the process and&#13;
&#13;
 the fact that we must make sure that in the new context we&#13;
&#13;
 can demonstrate that there is strengthening of the link&#13;
&#13;
 between debt relief and poverty alleviation.        So, we will&#13;
&#13;
 have to make some tradeoffs, and we are not clear at this&#13;
&#13;
 stage on how we should make these tradeoffs, in particular&#13;
&#13;
 in the context of retroactive countries.&#13;
                                                                     Page67&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           This was part of the discussion we had in early&#13;
&#13;
 August and, frankly, we are not very clear on how both the&#13;
&#13;
 IMF and the Bank staff intend to handle this issue of&#13;
&#13;
 balancing between the need to demonstrate and the need to&#13;
&#13;
 be quite quick in the process.&#13;
&#13;
           This will have also consequences in terms of&#13;
&#13;
 fairness of the process between the various countries and,&#13;
&#13;
 in particular, the way we treat the retroactive country.&#13;
&#13;
 So, once more, yes, for case-by-case approach, but we must&#13;
&#13;
 make sure that all of this is consistent.&#13;
&#13;
           One point on the link with the IMF.           Several&#13;
&#13;
 speakers mentioned that operational collaboration between&#13;
&#13;
 the two institutions will be crucial in achieving the&#13;
&#13;
 objectives we are setting to ourselves.            We believe that&#13;
&#13;
 in this sector the Bank should have the leadership and&#13;
&#13;
 that the expertise on the social sector must be on the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank side, and that the two institutions should be in the&#13;
&#13;
 position to complement each other from this standpoint.&#13;
&#13;
           The British chair has invented the notion of&#13;
&#13;
 intelligent customer, which is very interesting, and it is&#13;
&#13;
 a very good way of presenting it.       But we have to be very&#13;
&#13;
 clear from the Bank side on what it means.           It means that&#13;
&#13;
 we must have the capacity to deliver.         And there are some&#13;
                                                                      Page68&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 tough sentences in the IMF paper on the Bank from this&#13;
&#13;
 standpoint.   But we will be able to justify that we have&#13;
&#13;
 the expertise and we should contribute to the ESAF program&#13;
&#13;
 only if we are able to deliver, which means that, first,&#13;
&#13;
 we may have to modify some of our way of doing business,&#13;
&#13;
 but also adapt our timetables to the IMF ones sometimes.&#13;
&#13;
            And really, there is an issue there.      We have&#13;
&#13;
 been able to solve it after some difficulties in the&#13;
&#13;
 financial sector.    We must be able to do it in the social&#13;
&#13;
 sectors also now.&#13;
&#13;
            One final word on the social and structural&#13;
&#13;
 reviews.   I don't want to open the discussion with Masood&#13;
&#13;
 we had in July on that.      I share the view expressed&#13;
&#13;
 earlier that we are not really in a position to evaluate&#13;
&#13;
 what has been done, but we agree with the fact that these&#13;
&#13;
 two will be very important in implementing this framework.&#13;
&#13;
            On the other hand, we must not lose sight of&#13;
&#13;
 what was the initial purpose of this instrument.       Yes, it&#13;
&#13;
 was created in post-crisis situation and we must expand it&#13;
&#13;
 to more normal business.      But we must really maintain the&#13;
&#13;
 focus on the structure on the identification of structural&#13;
&#13;
 weaknesses and somehow not just focus on social and losing&#13;
&#13;
 sight of that.&#13;
                                                                  Page69&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           And the link between the two will be very&#13;
&#13;
 important.    In the initial paper, as far as I remember,&#13;
&#13;
 the poverty dimension was only one part, what I understand&#13;
&#13;
 as somehow trying to have a chapeau, but only if the other&#13;
&#13;
 building blocks are still there.        And maybe some&#13;
&#13;
 additional comments on that could be useful.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:     Thank you very much, Jean.&#13;
&#13;
           Akira Kamitomai, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. KAMITOMAI:     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           I would like to join other colleagues to commend&#13;
&#13;
 the staff for their excellent work.         It comprehensively&#13;
&#13;
 presents a strategy for this important challenge.&#13;
&#13;
           We consider the HIPC Initiative as one of the&#13;
&#13;
 important mechanisms to address poverty, and we welcome&#13;
&#13;
 the opportunity to discuss ways to enhance such&#13;
&#13;
 mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
           Links between debt reduction and poverty&#13;
&#13;
 alleviation must be owned by the HIPC countries&#13;
&#13;
 themselves.   And in this regard, we think it is extremely&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate that the HIPC poverty paper is discussed&#13;
&#13;
 together with the poverty reduction strategy paper that&#13;
                                                                  Page70&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 will be useful for HIPC countries in designing such&#13;
&#13;
 strategy.&#13;
&#13;
             Many of the efforts to strengthen debt relief&#13;
&#13;
 and poverty alleviation is relevant to the Bank's overall&#13;
&#13;
 effort to address poverty.      But I will focus my&#13;
&#13;
 intervention on the HIPC paper, which touches on the two&#13;
&#13;
 related papers as well.&#13;
&#13;
             First of all, as proposed by the management, we&#13;
&#13;
 support the integration of the HIPC Initiative into the&#13;
&#13;
 comprehensive effort to enhance the poverty impact of&#13;
&#13;
 Bank-Fund supported framework.       In implementing the&#13;
&#13;
 comprehensive strategy, we believe that a country-based&#13;
&#13;
 approach is appropriate since each HIPC country is unique&#13;
&#13;
 in its social and economic condition, level of poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction effort, government capacity and in resources&#13;
&#13;
 freed up from debt relief.&#13;
&#13;
             We believe that the CAS will be the most&#13;
&#13;
 important vehicle in the implementation and, hence,&#13;
&#13;
 improving the quality of the CAS would be essential.&#13;
&#13;
             As we have learned from the last poverty&#13;
&#13;
 progress report, we still have a lot of room to improve&#13;
&#13;
 the quality of poverty assessment and to strengthen the&#13;
&#13;
 link between the assessment and the CAS.            We hope that the&#13;
                                                                        Page71&#13;

                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 Bank will redouble their efforts in these areas, since&#13;
&#13;
 they are important in successful implementation of this&#13;
&#13;
 strategy.&#13;
&#13;
             Secondly, on outcome-oriented approach, we&#13;
&#13;
 believe that this is extremely appropriate since the Bank&#13;
&#13;
 is focusing more on outcomes rather than inputs to assess&#13;
&#13;
 performance of its operations.       We also believe that&#13;
&#13;
 participation of the civil society is important to the&#13;
&#13;
 effectiveness of the strategy, since it enhances&#13;
&#13;
 ownership, transparency and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
             However, up until now, the civil society that&#13;
&#13;
 has made a contribution to the discussion on the debt&#13;
&#13;
 relief and poverty was mainly international advocacy NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
 We hope that as we move towards implementation of this&#13;
&#13;
 strategy, the broader civil society in the field should&#13;
&#13;
 participate in this effort.&#13;
&#13;
             Third, on replacing PFP to PRSP, we are still&#13;
&#13;
 unclear of the added value of this exercise.        We would&#13;
&#13;
 imagine that addressing poverty reduction strategy more&#13;
&#13;
 comprehensively in the CAS, while maintaining full&#13;
&#13;
 consistency with PFP, could be also effective in&#13;
&#13;
 addressing poverty.    We would appreciate staff's comments&#13;
&#13;
 on this point.&#13;
                                                                Page72&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           We also notice that there are similar ESWs&#13;
&#13;
 lately and think it would be useful to streamline some of&#13;
&#13;
 them.   For example, in relation to poverty, there are ESWs&#13;
&#13;
 such as poverty assessment, social assessment and social&#13;
&#13;
 and structural review and the role of these documents are&#13;
&#13;
 not always so clear.&#13;
&#13;
           Other donors are also actively engaged in doing&#13;
&#13;
 similar assessments, and we hope that the Bank will&#13;
&#13;
 coordinate with other donors in order to avoid duplication&#13;
&#13;
 and enhance efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
           Lastly, we can support the idea of having a&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction strategy in place by the decision point,&#13;
&#13;
 but in order for this strategy to be sustainable, even&#13;
&#13;
 after the completion point, it is important that the&#13;
&#13;
 strategy is fully owned by the government.&#13;
&#13;
           In designing such a poverty alleviation&#13;
&#13;
 strategy, we believe that closer collaboration between the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank and the Fund is critical, since the strategy has to&#13;
&#13;
 be fully consistent with the ESAF program.         Therefore, we&#13;
&#13;
 urge strengthened collaboration between these two&#13;
&#13;
 institutions in the operations and for the Bank, as the&#13;
&#13;
 French chair mention, strengthening of the capacity to&#13;
&#13;
 deliver timely is an urgent task.&#13;
                                                                    Page73&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           In addition, strategic benchmarks up to the&#13;
&#13;
 completion points should be the ones that are central to&#13;
&#13;
 the development of the country, and should not be&#13;
&#13;
 compromised for early completion point.&#13;
&#13;
           We believe an early completion point should be&#13;
&#13;
 warranted only in the case of strong performance, and we&#13;
&#13;
 hope such a mechanism will serve as an incentive for HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 countries to achieve the goal.&#13;

           Thank you.&#13;

           MS. CORDEIRO:    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           At this stage of the debate, I will try to be&#13;
&#13;
 very brief, because a lot of what has been said is&#13;
&#13;
 definitely shared by us and I will try to move it forward,&#13;
&#13;
 if possible.&#13;
&#13;
           I would like to stress immediately that a lot&#13;
&#13;
 what Jean Pesme has said is very much in the same line of&#13;
&#13;
 our thinking, and the need to balance the different&#13;
&#13;
 dimensions of all of this.&#13;
&#13;
           Very briefly, I would like, as many others, to&#13;
&#13;
 welcome these papers, while recognizing that they are&#13;
&#13;
 different; they are different in scope, in quality and in&#13;
                                                              Page74&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 stage of preparation.    And I think a word comes out&#13;
&#13;
 immediately from my side on the concerns that the social&#13;
&#13;
 structural reviews still pose to us -- again, Jean just&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned, and we had a discussion with Masood before -- I&#13;
&#13;
 still want to come back at the right time because I think&#13;
&#13;
 they are one important piece, and a poverty chapeau is&#13;
&#13;
 needed.   But we cannot eliminate or dilute the importance&#13;
&#13;
 of key blocks that have to be there.        And they were the&#13;
&#13;
 core nature of those studies.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I see the paper as a progress report with&#13;
&#13;
 some important lessons, I think the integration, the&#13;
&#13;
 building blocks that have to come up.          But, in my view,&#13;
&#13;
 it has to remain with a very clear focus.&#13;
&#13;
           The other two papers definitely come as nothing&#13;
&#13;
 new but very important value-added of the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
 agenda.   And I hope it will be beyond the World Bank, and&#13;
&#13;
 I think it will be a tripartite effort, although it raises&#13;
&#13;
 certainly a lot of issues.&#13;
&#13;
           So, we see from this approach a consolidation of&#13;
&#13;
 a lot of aspects, of tools, of instruments.        And we attach&#13;
&#13;
 a lot of important to what now is called -- and I agree&#13;
&#13;
 the title may need to be rethought -- the poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategy paper.     And we would view it as the key&#13;
                                                                    Page75&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 long-term framework for Bank intervention, and I hope it&#13;
&#13;
 will be Bank-Fund intervention.&#13;
&#13;
           The fact that it came out in the context of the&#13;
&#13;
 HIPC Initiative does not diminish its importance.       It is&#13;
&#13;
 the opposite; it gives it more meaning, and I think it is&#13;
&#13;
 relevant for the HIPC.    We agree with those that said that&#13;
&#13;
 as much as possible it has to be part of the HIPC process&#13;
&#13;
 of decision, which means that on the decision point we&#13;
&#13;
 want to have as much as we can towards a strategy owned by&#13;
&#13;
 the country, produced on a participatory approach.       But we&#13;
&#13;
 know that reality will not allow us the ideal situation&#13;
&#13;
 when we may have to compromise.       But the compromise cannot&#13;
&#13;
 be by losing the focus on poverty.        And I think that is&#13;
&#13;
 definitely an important aspect that we see at this stage.&#13;
&#13;
           We see the PRSP will become crucial but common&#13;
&#13;
 for all IDA countries.    We would see it as being the real&#13;
&#13;
 base framework, and it is a long-term approach.&#13;
&#13;
 Certainly, it will have to be updated, it will have to be&#13;
&#13;
 improved, but it should be the underpinning document, the&#13;
&#13;
 underpinning process more than document, of the&#13;
&#13;
 relationship between the Bank, the Fund, the country and&#13;
&#13;
 within the country.   So, we see it that it will be the key&#13;
&#13;
 departing point for the CAS.&#13;
                                                                   Page76&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           The CAS may need to be adjusted.         It should&#13;
&#13;
 remain; it should allow us to focus much more on how are&#13;
&#13;
 we going to deliver and assist the country objectives&#13;
&#13;
 spelled out in the strategy, what are the risks, what are&#13;
&#13;
 the tradeoffs, what is our business strategy to deliver,&#13;
&#13;
 what are the costs, what are the outcomes.         And I think&#13;
&#13;
 the accountability will be part of that.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I envisage adjustments in the CAS but not&#13;
&#13;
 change in the importance of the CAS, but I believe the CAS&#13;
&#13;
 would certainly benefit from the introduction from this&#13;
&#13;
 new framework.&#13;
&#13;
           I think one aspect that somehow has been&#13;
&#13;
 referred to but I think that has to be brought out is the&#13;
&#13;
 issue of resources.   So, the public finance framework in&#13;
&#13;
 the medium-term at least -- because I think there it is&#13;
&#13;
 more difficult to go on a long-term -- has to be part of&#13;
&#13;
 the exercise.&#13;
&#13;
           The experience that the Bank had with the public&#13;
&#13;
 expenditure review has been mixed because of different&#13;
&#13;
 things, but I think we have to move beyond the public&#13;
&#13;
 expenditure review with a broad approach including&#13;
&#13;
 resources.   And I think the resources have to be there,&#13;
&#13;
 and I agree with those that make the emphasis that we are&#13;
                                                                  Page77&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 looking to the overall resources, external and domestic&#13;
&#13;
 generated, towards improving the situation.&#13;
&#13;
            So, I think there another area of cooperation&#13;
&#13;
 with the Fund will be necessary in terms of developing&#13;
&#13;
 appropriate medium-term fiscal framework if one can use&#13;
&#13;
 that simple word.&#13;
&#13;
            One aspect that also has been mentioned by Jean&#13;
&#13;
 Pesme lately is in fact the centrality of macro stability&#13;
&#13;
 which comes up as a key aspect of the ESAF program, but it&#13;
&#13;
 is also an aspect for us.       And so, we have to make sure&#13;
&#13;
 that the consistency between the macro objectives and the&#13;
&#13;
 social and poverty strategy emphasis have to be taken into&#13;
&#13;
 account.   And I assume that the ESAF process and approach&#13;
&#13;
 has to suffer some adjustment too, because the consistency&#13;
&#13;
 will have to start from that point.&#13;
&#13;
            I haven't read the IMF paper.             I only looked at&#13;
&#13;
 the issues for discussion, because I only got the paper&#13;
&#13;
 today.   And I agree with the comment made that it is a&#13;
&#13;
 very different way of looking to the issue than what we&#13;
&#13;
 are doing.   It is very tough on the Bank.             I don't know if&#13;
&#13;
 it is totally warranted, but it puts a challenge on us.&#13;
&#13;
 And I agree with the line of action that Jean just&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned.   We should do our best to maintain our&#13;
                                                                          Page78&#13;

&#13;
 expertise and responsibility on the social policies and&#13;
&#13;
 cooperate with the Fund, adjusting the timetable, if&#13;
&#13;
 possible.    But basically, we cannot deliver, we should not&#13;
&#13;
 engage ourselves.&#13;
&#13;
             But I hope that we will be able to do it.        And I&#13;
&#13;
 think if we take, in fact, the proposal that this new&#13;
&#13;
 framework is, in fact, a tripartite government, Fund and&#13;
&#13;
 Bank, it should be possible to eliminate a lot of&#13;
&#13;
 difficulties that have been mentioned.&#13;
&#13;
             At least, I think there are underlying issues in&#13;
&#13;
 the Fund paper that we may have to come back on among&#13;
&#13;
 ourselves.&#13;
&#13;
             Another aspect that we very much support but are&#13;
&#13;
 cautious about how ambitious we can be on the delivery is&#13;
&#13;
 on the results outcome-based programs.           Definitely we all&#13;
&#13;
 agree with the importance but we all know the&#13;
&#13;
 difficulties.    It should not prevent us to move ahead, but&#13;
&#13;
 I think it makes us conscious of the limitations.&#13;
&#13;
             And I think one particular aspect that we have&#13;
&#13;
 to keep in mind, that it is not only the design, the&#13;
&#13;
 measurement and the monitoring, but it is the time factor&#13;
&#13;
 that really is so important in assessing poverty impact.&#13;
&#13;
 That sometimes is inconsistent with our own cycles.          Of&#13;
                                                                      Page79&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 course, in the case of the HIPC Initiative, there is a&#13;
&#13;
 very, very conflicting message because we want debt relief&#13;
&#13;
 quicker, but we want it in a very strong linkage with&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           I think that we are going to deal with this&#13;
&#13;
 aspect in the near future, particularly when we start&#13;
&#13;
 implementing the enhanced initiative.         But it is a reality&#13;
&#13;
 and it is going to raise the issues of fairness and&#13;
&#13;
 consistency across countries that certainly should be on&#13;
&#13;
 our minds.&#13;
&#13;
           Many people have spoken and I fully agree with&#13;
&#13;
 the ownership by countries and the participatory process.&#13;
&#13;
 But it is very difficult.     And I think it is not only&#13;
&#13;
 difficult because of the capacity, but it is difficult&#13;
&#13;
 because of motivation.    And I think Neil and Jean have&#13;
&#13;
 referred to precisely the political commitment that is&#13;
&#13;
 necessary, and it goes beyond the technical limitation.&#13;
&#13;
           And I think we should avoid to fall in the trap&#13;
&#13;
 that in my mind the PFP is an example, that really does&#13;
&#13;
 not help in building ownership and commitment from&#13;
&#13;
 authorities.&#13;
&#13;
           But after saying all of this, I would like&#13;
&#13;
 basically to ask management with the strong support that&#13;
                                                                     Page80&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 has been given in this Board on the enhanced framework and&#13;
&#13;
 the several elements, I think definitely we have to move&#13;
&#13;
 towards a strategy or master plan, as I think Jean&#13;
&#13;
 mentioned, how to operationalize it.        And definitely at&#13;
&#13;
 least three levels will be very crucial.&#13;
&#13;
            One is the cooperation and collaboration with&#13;
&#13;
 the IMF.   And there again, I think we will hear about the&#13;
&#13;
 how the IMF Board addressed the questions that are on the&#13;
&#13;
 table.   I don't know even if this Board fully agrees with&#13;
&#13;
 all the questions and analysis, but definitely we have to&#13;
&#13;
 be very firm about how we are going to address this issue.&#13;
&#13;
            We know that what is being proposed -- and I&#13;
&#13;
 think this morning it was clearly emphasized by both Mike&#13;
&#13;
 and Peter, I guess -- this approach is a dramatic shift in&#13;
&#13;
 the way we work, inside the Bank but the way we work with&#13;
&#13;
 other partners.   And I think the Fund here is critical.&#13;
&#13;
            I think flexibility can exist in exercising the&#13;
&#13;
 complementarity between the two institutions, but I think&#13;
&#13;
 we have to have a very clear line where the management and&#13;
&#13;
 the Board see this process to go forward in order to&#13;
&#13;
 position us as an equal -- in this case maybe more than&#13;
&#13;
 equal, because the Bank has the expertise and has the&#13;
                                                                 Page81&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 experience, and I hope that we will be able to have the&#13;
&#13;
 necessary skills on time to deliver this.&#13;
&#13;
           The second level for personalizing all this plan&#13;
&#13;
 is, in fact, the internal apparatus of the Bank that has&#13;
&#13;
 to be adjusted.   I mean, the word "consolidation" comes to&#13;
&#13;
 mind immediately, but before consolidation I think we&#13;
&#13;
 really have to look at the wide array of instruments that&#13;
&#13;
 we are using.   The ESW is the best umbrella but it doesn't&#13;
&#13;
 tell us anything.    When we go down and disintegrate the&#13;
&#13;
 ESW, we have a multiplicity and also in terms of what that&#13;
&#13;
 means in our relationship with the country.          I will come&#13;
&#13;
 to that issue under the umbrella of the countries.&#13;
&#13;
           But the references that have been made on the&#13;
&#13;
 country teams, networks and skills are very important, but&#13;
&#13;
 I think they have to go beyond that in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
 strategic documents, strategic papers.           For us, I believe&#13;
&#13;
 the Board still attaches the maximum importance to the&#13;
&#13;
 CAS, but recognizes that there are underpinnings of the&#13;
&#13;
 CAS that have to remain.&#13;
&#13;
           So, consolidation, yes, eventually elimination&#13;
&#13;
 of separate pieces but not undermining what we are&#13;
&#13;
 accomplishing by enlarging and broadening our approach.&#13;
                                                                      Page82&#13;

                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           And the third level for the road map is, in&#13;
&#13;
 fact, in countries and our relationship with countries.&#13;
&#13;
 And I think again we have to go beyond the words of&#13;
&#13;
 partnership, ownership, political commitment, but in&#13;
&#13;
 reality how we are going to assist the countries in taking&#13;
&#13;
 the lead of that potential.&#13;
&#13;
           I fully agree with the dimension that Neil Hyden&#13;
&#13;
 gave to the governance issue.      And I think that is very,&#13;
&#13;
 very important, precisely in our relationship with the&#13;
&#13;
 countries.   I think he is absolutely right that it is part&#13;
&#13;
 of empowerment but it is higher than empowerment, and I&#13;
&#13;
 think we have to bring it across the higher level.&#13;
&#13;
           One final comment on the retroactive application&#13;
&#13;
 of the new framework for the HIPC countries.         I think we&#13;
&#13;
 have to be cautious about bringing additional requirements&#13;
&#13;
 at this stage without ignoring the emphasis on poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction.   But I think timing, fairness has to be part of&#13;
&#13;
 the way we look on specifics.&#13;
&#13;
           I think the issue is simplified.         If we look at&#13;
&#13;
 the poverty reduction strategies as permanent frameworks&#13;
&#13;
 for action, it will be possible, as we move along, to&#13;
&#13;
 refine its elaboration on each country and IDA will remain&#13;
&#13;
 the key player in these countries.        Unfortunately, we are&#13;
                                                                    Page83&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 not in a position of imagining that it will be out of the&#13;
&#13;
 playing field.   So, we have an opportunity to bring back&#13;
&#13;
 all these countries in a more, I would say, deeper and&#13;
&#13;
 broader approach that now may be possible in other&#13;
&#13;
 countries.&#13;
&#13;
           So, we are really pleased with what we are&#13;
&#13;
 seeing.   We are cautious about how we go about&#13;
&#13;
 implementation, and we encourage management to move ahead&#13;
&#13;
 and start spelling out precisely in these two or three&#13;
&#13;
 dimensions how we will move ahead.&#13;

           Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;

&#13;
           MR. BOGAARD:    Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           I am in a bit of trouble at this time, because I&#13;
&#13;
 would like to be short; I don't like to repeat people and&#13;
&#13;
 I also want to give a comprehensive view on these very&#13;
&#13;
 good papers.   So, I have to find some balance here.&#13;
&#13;
           I think it is clear that paragraph 15 of the&#13;
&#13;
 paper on poverty strategy more or less defines the basic&#13;
&#13;
 outlines of the approach -- good analysis, prioritization&#13;
&#13;
 of policies and participation.       We are very much in&#13;
&#13;
 support of that.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           In the past year, we have focused on pro-poor&#13;
&#13;
 growth, moving beyond a single focus on social protection&#13;
&#13;
 and increasing social expenditure.         And in this document,&#13;
&#13;
 staff rightly stresses the importance of taking a broad&#13;
&#13;
 view on poverty, including empowerment and in general&#13;
&#13;
 reducing barriers throughout the economic and social&#13;
&#13;
 system to poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           I think in view also of disturbing trends in&#13;
&#13;
 poverty, our CAS documents and everything basically we do&#13;
&#13;
 should focus on the issue of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
           We also appreciate the attention paid to gender&#13;
&#13;
 in the document.   It is both morally right I think to take&#13;
&#13;
 this into account and economically sound.           It also comes&#13;
&#13;
 out of recent research on the link between poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction and gender in the Africa Region.&#13;
&#13;
           In practical terms, the suggested approach&#13;
&#13;
 implies that we need to take a holistic view I think on&#13;
&#13;
 both the inputs to debt relief, tax revenues, also human&#13;
&#13;
 capital as an input and, at the same time, a holistic view&#13;
&#13;
 on policy outputs and outcomes more specifically.&#13;
&#13;
           In this regard, if we look at public policies,&#13;
&#13;
 countries should try and develop a medium-term expenditure&#13;
&#13;
 framework, and they would also greatly benefit if they&#13;
                                                                     Page85&#13;

                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 could complement such a framework with medium-term&#13;
&#13;
 commitments from donors, not only in the CAS of the World&#13;
&#13;
 Bank or in a three-year ESAF program but also from other&#13;
&#13;
 donors.&#13;
&#13;
           In relation to the medium-term framework, I&#13;
&#13;
 would also like to draw attention to the work that is&#13;
&#13;
 ongoing on the Special Program for Africa, where they try&#13;
&#13;
 to work from a balance of payments approach to a budgetary&#13;
&#13;
 gap approach, which facilitates the connection between aid&#13;
&#13;
 and policies and between inputs and results.       This might&#13;
&#13;
 also be a way to refocus our discussions with the IMF on a&#13;
&#13;
 macroeconomic framework.&#13;
&#13;
           It is obvious -- almost everybody has said this&#13;
&#13;
 so far -- that the biggest challenge, if we agree on the&#13;
&#13;
 framework, is implementation and in order to make the&#13;
&#13;
 approach work, we need to foster partnerships outside the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank, and this goes broader I think than only the IMF and&#13;
&#13;
 the country.   We have been talking about a tripartite&#13;
&#13;
 effort.   I think it should be even broader, including&#13;
&#13;
 other donors, other regional development banks.&#13;
&#13;
           I think the poverty reduction strategy papers&#13;
&#13;
 could be a very useful element of these partnerships.      And&#13;
&#13;
 we hope to begin with, they are more than a joint effort&#13;
                                                                  Page86&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 than the almost Fund-only policy framework papers that we&#13;
&#13;
 currently have.   So, we fully support the replacement of&#13;
&#13;
 the PFPs with the PRSPs, as proposed.&#13;
&#13;
           What I also felt compelling about the proposal&#13;
&#13;
 was the idea to make the PRSP process an iterative process&#13;
&#13;
 during which all policy targets, including the IMF targets&#13;
&#13;
 are up for discussion, in which all structural,&#13;
&#13;
 macroeconomic policies are being related to poverty.&#13;
&#13;
           In this respect, if one compares the Bank paper,&#13;
&#13;
 which is very comprehensive in its approach to poverty,&#13;
&#13;
 with the IMF paper, I found it a bit disappointing that&#13;
&#13;
 the Fund presents the PRSP in a paper with a title which&#13;
&#13;
 refers to social policies only and not to the broader set&#13;
&#13;
 of poverty reduction policies.&#13;
&#13;
           We also need to foster partnerships inside the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank, especially within the matrix management.       I think&#13;
&#13;
 that the responsibilities of networks need to be&#13;
&#13;
 clarified, and they should be allocated resources to match&#13;
&#13;
 their roles and possibly regions should try to communicate&#13;
&#13;
 with each other more to learn from each other.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, one small point on instruments:       I&#13;
&#13;
 think that we should not presume that countries with PRSP&#13;
&#13;
 receive more program-based support.        I can imagine a&#13;
                                                                Page87&#13;

&#13;
 situation in which a country has a PRSP and still not has&#13;
&#13;
 the implementation capacity to work with program-based&#13;
&#13;
 instruments.&#13;
&#13;
           Quickly, on the relation to HIPC, I think for&#13;
&#13;
 countries that have qualified for debt relief already and&#13;
&#13;
 are expected to qualify for debt relief in the short-term,&#13;
&#13;
 we should take a somewhat flexible approach.          But&#13;
&#13;
 hopefully, they could have as much of a poverty strategy&#13;
&#13;
 in place as possible by the time they reach their decision&#13;
&#13;
 point and certainly when they reach the completion point.&#13;
&#13;
           This requirement should also be applied flexibly&#13;
&#13;
 to retroactive countries, but good policies to reduce&#13;
&#13;
 poverty I think should be a requirement to qualify for&#13;
&#13;
 additional debt relief.&#13;
&#13;
           With regard to the structural policy reviews, we&#13;
&#13;
 several times stressed the need for better selectivity&#13;
&#13;
 management, a systemization of economic and sector work,&#13;
&#13;
 and I think John Sinclair made it clear that also we not&#13;
&#13;
 only have the acronym ESW, but we also have a huge number&#13;
&#13;
 of acronyms which fall under the umbrella of ESW, and we&#13;
&#13;
 hope that some streamlining can be done.&#13;
&#13;
           Those are all my points.       Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much, Hein.&#13;

             Mr. Pandian, please.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. PANDIAN:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
             Like others, we also welcome the papers, which&#13;
&#13;
 really put their heart and soul on poverty reduction,&#13;
&#13;
 which is the main mandate of this Bank.&#13;
&#13;
             To begin with regarding paper one, "HIPC:&#13;
&#13;
 Strengthening the Link Between Debt Relief and Poverty&#13;
&#13;
 Reduction", we welcome the suggestion that all resources&#13;
&#13;
 should be put in position to fight poverty, not only debt&#13;
&#13;
 relief but also domestic resources.&#13;
&#13;
             But our question is whether there will be enough&#13;
&#13;
 domestic resources available to achieve a desired result.&#13;
&#13;
 So, we may go beyond that and to generate additional&#13;
&#13;
 resources, the government may have to invest in new&#13;
&#13;
 infrastructure.    How are we going to balance this&#13;
&#13;
 question?&#13;
&#13;
             Number two, we also welcome to build on the&#13;
&#13;
 existing framework to build a new strategy.         But at the&#13;
&#13;
 same time, we have certain reservations about involving&#13;
&#13;
 the civil society in the formulation, selection and&#13;
&#13;
 monitoring of output indicators.        It is a problem in&#13;
&#13;
 selecting civil society when the country and government is&#13;
&#13;
 infested with a number of civil society organizations.&#13;
                                                                  Page89&#13;

&#13;
 How are we going to discriminate between a good civil&#13;
&#13;
 society group and a bad civil society group?        Everybody&#13;
&#13;
 has a vested interest.&#13;
&#13;
           In this connection, again ownership should be&#13;
&#13;
 given to the country.    If the government is comfortable&#13;
&#13;
 with the civil group, it can go ahead.         If it is not&#13;
&#13;
 comfortable, then the democratically-elected process&#13;
&#13;
 should not be undermined, because a number of countries do&#13;
&#13;
 have local authorities, local elected governments and we&#13;
&#13;
 should make use of those institutions.         In fact, if they&#13;
&#13;
 do not have the capacity to plan, to monitor, that&#13;
&#13;
 capacity should be built, and the World Bank Institute in&#13;
&#13;
 association with other local and regional organizations&#13;
&#13;
 can arrange a number of programs to build the capacity at&#13;
&#13;
 the grassroots level.&#13;
&#13;
           We also welcome the poverty reduction strategy&#13;
&#13;
 paper.   In fact, we very much appreciate the participatory&#13;
&#13;
 approach being adopted in preparing this.&#13;
&#13;
           But one thing we would like to point out that in&#13;
&#13;
 a number of countries, at least particularly in the&#13;
&#13;
 constituencies we represent, there are planning&#13;
&#13;
 ministries, democratically-elected representatives, that&#13;
&#13;
 do prepare the local plan, regional plan and the country&#13;
                                                                   Page90&#13;

                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 plan.   I think that these things also cannot be&#13;
&#13;
 undermined.    They should be given proper importance and&#13;
&#13;
 proper role.&#13;
&#13;
           What is needed is how civil society can be&#13;
&#13;
 involved in these processes.       Perhaps in collaboration&#13;
&#13;
 with the poor people, in collaboration with the local&#13;
&#13;
 people, they should see whether these projects are&#13;
&#13;
 properly implemented at the implementation stage.      As my&#13;
&#13;
 colleagues pointed out, the question of governance, the&#13;
&#13;
 question of commitment, the question of delivery comes&#13;
&#13;
 into the picture; it is here the civil society can&#13;
&#13;
 associate to see that the desired results are achieved and&#13;
&#13;
 it is being distributed.&#13;
&#13;
           As far as questions number four and five are&#13;
&#13;
 concerned, already the HIPC activity is delayed very much.&#13;
&#13;
 So, we would like to agree with the staff that instead of&#13;
&#13;
 waiting for the completion point we can go ahead with the&#13;
&#13;
 relief; probably the government is committed for a poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategy.&#13;
&#13;
           Now coming to the second paper, Mr. Chairman,&#13;
&#13;
 the poverty reduction strategy, we also welcome the&#13;
&#13;
 outcome-based approach.     Definitely, this will give a&#13;
                                                                Page91&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 clear-cut improvement in the CAS process.          We welcome&#13;
&#13;
 that.&#13;
&#13;
            But again, this cannot be a straitjacket&#13;
&#13;
 approach; it varies from country to country, because, as&#13;
&#13;
 the paper itself has pointed out, the countries which have&#13;
&#13;
 massive poverty like India and Bangladesh, we had growth.&#13;
&#13;
 We concentrated on growth in the 1990s, in the early 1990s&#13;
&#13;
 but still poverty was stagnant.       We concentrated on the&#13;
&#13;
 income redistribution in the late 1970s and 1980s but the&#13;
&#13;
 growth was stagnant.   What we need is both.        We need&#13;
&#13;
 growth as well as fairly distributed income.&#13;
&#13;
            If you take India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, nearly&#13;
&#13;
 40 percent of the people are living below the poverty&#13;
&#13;
 line.   And these countries face a different unique&#13;
&#13;
 problem.   In fact, rather than concentrating on growth or&#13;
&#13;
 huge investment in infrastructure, if you spend a small&#13;
&#13;
 amount in improving our tax collection system, that will&#13;
&#13;
 create more wealth, and the distribution definitely should&#13;
&#13;
 be given importance.&#13;
&#13;
            So, the strategy may vary from country to&#13;
&#13;
 country, particularly if you want to bring down the&#13;
&#13;
 poverty in a massive level and these countries where the&#13;
&#13;
 poverty is massive should be given due importance.         We&#13;
                                                                 Page92&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 feel that this paper seems to be a little more Africa-&#13;
&#13;
 based.   No doubt, a number of poor countries are in the&#13;
&#13;
 Africa Region, but, at the same time, there are few&#13;
&#13;
 countries in other regions where a number of people are&#13;
&#13;
 poor.&#13;
&#13;
            Again, we find it a little discouraging to note&#13;
&#13;
 that there is no mention of technology, taking technology&#13;
&#13;
 to fight poverty.    Like the Industrial Revolution, today&#13;
&#13;
 is the Technological Revolution, and to what extent we can&#13;
&#13;
 use the technology to fight poverty.          It may be disease or&#13;
&#13;
 it may be quality education or it may be building economic&#13;
&#13;
 assets which can be easily accessible by the poor people.&#13;
&#13;
 So, I think the Bank should do some research how&#13;
&#13;
 effectively technology can be used to fight poverty and to&#13;
&#13;
 do global common good.&#13;
&#13;
            Thank you very much.&#13;

            Like all the other speakers, I would also like&#13;
&#13;
 to commend staff, and I guess I have decided that I will&#13;
&#13;
 not do justice with those papers but try to be brief&#13;
&#13;
 instead.&#13;
                                                                      Page93&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             I have a few points and the main message from&#13;
&#13;
 all the following points is that on a conceptual level, we&#13;
&#13;
 like very much the proposals for the enhanced framework,&#13;
&#13;
 but we are very concerned that this may contradict the&#13;
&#13;
 objective of speedy debt relief, that we are just&#13;
&#13;
 overloading the initiative.      But I will go in step-by-&#13;
&#13;
 step.&#13;
&#13;
             First, we fully agree that actually the overall&#13;
&#13;
 framework is important for poverty reduction, not just for&#13;
&#13;
 HIPC.    So, whatever criteria we use for quick-disbursing&#13;
&#13;
 funds, it will be the same ones for HIPC.           It is the same&#13;
&#13;
 thing.   And, therefore, all the necessary measures, in&#13;
&#13;
 particular on improving the quality of budget management&#13;
&#13;
 and accounting, all of those things have to be applied to&#13;
&#13;
 HIPC as well, and that will take time.          We will not be&#13;
&#13;
 able to do that in twelve to eighteen months.&#13;
&#13;
             The second point, of course, conceptually we&#13;
&#13;
 like very much the move towards outcome-oriented&#13;
&#13;
 objectives and impact indicators.        Our experience from the&#13;
&#13;
 field is very clear that this is the key thing that we&#13;
&#13;
 ought to be monitoring rather than traditional policy&#13;
&#13;
 measures.    At the same time, we have learned very much in&#13;
&#13;
 the SPA, the Special Program for Africa exercise, of how&#13;
                                                                      Page94&#13;
&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 complicated it is to define, measure and monitor such&#13;
&#13;
 outcome indicators.&#13;
&#13;
           So, we think this is going to be a very big&#13;
&#13;
 challenge, even though conceptually it is the right thing.&#13;
&#13;
           Similarly, with the poverty reduction strategy&#13;
&#13;
 paper, again this sounds like an excellent exercise.      It&#13;
&#13;
 is very consistent with our objective, with what we would&#13;
&#13;
 like to achieve, but it may be a very complex exercise to&#13;
&#13;
 do, particularly if we want to have a highly participatory&#13;
&#13;
 process to develop -- as John said, it cannot be reduced.&#13;
&#13;
 So we always have to say poverty reduction strategy paper.&#13;
&#13;
 It doesn't go by the acronym.&#13;
&#13;
           It is going to be very complicated.      We are not&#13;
&#13;
 quite sure when we will be ready to use this framework&#13;
&#13;
 paper or strategy paper and substitute that for the PFP.&#13;
&#13;
 And also, we are not quite clear whether it makes sense to&#13;
&#13;
 require countries to do this every three years in a fully&#13;
&#13;
 participatory way.    This may be asking too much; it may&#13;
&#13;
 not be the proper thing to do.      And this, of course, is a&#13;
&#13;
 comment that goes beyond HIPC.&#13;
&#13;
           Similarly, some of the innovations in the new&#13;
&#13;
 framework are the floating completion points and the&#13;
&#13;
 frontloading.   And we attach great importance to this.     We&#13;
                                                                  Page95&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 are strong supporters of those two features and,&#13;
&#13;
 therefore, urge really that we be very careful in how much&#13;
&#13;
 we load the enhanced framework with conditions that may&#13;
&#13;
 slow us down.&#13;
&#13;
           The last point is with regard to the countries&#13;
&#13;
 that have already reached the decision point under the&#13;
&#13;
 current framework or the completion point even.           It is&#13;
&#13;
 very important that they be treated equally and that we&#13;
&#13;
 don't really introduce sort of a third stage to the HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 implicitly with retroactive conditions.            So, we really&#13;
&#13;
 have to strike a balance here.&#13;
&#13;
           As I said, to sum up, the main concern is that&#13;
&#13;
 we continue with a speedy program, a speedy HIPC program.&#13;
&#13;
 We fully agree with the overall framework to enhance&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction as the key objective, but this should be&#13;
&#13;
 the objective for all of our activities.           And we have to&#13;
&#13;
 find a balance.&#13;
&#13;
           I would just like to make one last comment on&#13;
&#13;
 the other paper, on the paper for the building poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategies.    On the outcome table on page 9, it&#13;
&#13;
 mentions here that private consumption, poverty incidence&#13;
&#13;
 and inequality should be sort of key indicators for&#13;
&#13;
 economic opportunities.    If one could not include also an&#13;
                                                                     Page96&#13;

&#13;
 indicator for employment conditions, this would be a proxy&#13;
&#13;
 for many other things that go on in the poverty field or&#13;
&#13;
 in the vulnerability of people.         Maybe by including&#13;
&#13;
 employment indicators, that might be a very useful thing&#13;
&#13;
 to monitor as well, of course, in the various instruments&#13;
&#13;
 that the Bank has, such as CASs or whatever reviews we&#13;

 get.&#13;

&#13;
 talking about "Building Poverty Reduction Strategies in&#13;
&#13;
 Developing Countries".&#13;
&#13;
           I have a couple of suggestions.            I think the&#13;
&#13;
 paper will gain or it may be worthwhile looking at&#13;
&#13;
 different strategies to fight absolute poverty and&#13;
&#13;
 relative poverty.    I think they bring up two complete sets&#13;
&#13;
 of issues, and the strategy may well be totally different.&#13;
&#13;
           Economic growth probably will reduce absolute&#13;
&#13;
 poverty and will increase relative poverty.            Now, to fight&#13;
&#13;
 relative poverty is very, very difficult because it is in&#13;
                                                                        Page97&#13;

&#13;
 the nature of our policies that we carry to our countries&#13;
&#13;
 deregulation, competitive policy, change.           And things&#13;
&#13;
 change today in one year more than they used to change&#13;
&#13;
 before in 50 years.    So, it is in the nature of the&#13;
&#13;
 business that people are going to get more poor on&#13;
&#13;
 relative terms.    Even though their income may have&#13;
&#13;
 doubled, if the income of the whole society has tripled,&#13;
&#13;
 they are poorer.    So, that is an issue I would suggest to&#13;
&#13;
 look at because I think it is very important.&#13;
&#13;
             Also, there is an issue of picking up&#13;
&#13;
 priorities.    And the difficulty of this issue is clearly&#13;
&#13;
 in Table 1 on page 9, because there is a large inventory&#13;
&#13;
 of issues, but we have to be always aware that there is a&#13;
&#13;
 tradeoff.    And when we tell a country or a country decides&#13;
&#13;
 that it is going to invest more on microfinance, it really&#13;
&#13;
 invests less in education, it is investing less in health.&#13;
&#13;
 So, the whole budgetary process is crucial.&#13;
&#13;
             In that sense, I am very skeptical about this&#13;
&#13;
 participatory process, of empowering people in order to&#13;
&#13;
 reach a list of items, because the thing gets very&#13;
&#13;
 political instead of getting more technical, with the&#13;
&#13;
 economic rate of return and with good data to help the&#13;
&#13;
 budgetary process in the countries.         So, my position would&#13;
                                                                     Page98&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 be that we should not look so much at all of this&#13;
&#13;
 participatory process but we should look a little bit more&#13;
&#13;
 on the internal rate of return, on how the budgetary&#13;
&#13;
 process plays in these countries.&#13;
&#13;
           Just to finish, let me say that I think that in&#13;
&#13;
 these priorities trade and education are real crucial.      If&#13;
&#13;
 we look, for example, at Africa, the participation of&#13;
&#13;
 total world exports in Africa 1980 it was 6 percent, and&#13;
&#13;
 today it is less than 2 percent.       So, that is a question:&#13;
&#13;
 Why is that?   And I think that is an important question to&#13;
&#13;
 which we should try to give some answers.&#13;
&#13;
           The other issue is I think we should be more of&#13;
&#13;
 an education bank, because education is the only tool that&#13;
&#13;
 we have that, at the same time, growth is improved, it&#13;
&#13;
 diminishes relative poverty; it gives more equity, more&#13;
&#13;
 opportunity, and I think we should focus more on that.&#13;
&#13;

           A two-handed.    Jan.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. PIERCY:   I was just going to ask when you&#13;
&#13;
 anticipated having staff come back, because I have heard a&#13;
&#13;
 number of questions that, rather than repeat them, we&#13;
&#13;
 might at some point want to have an intervening comment&#13;
                                                                  Page99&#13;

&#13;
 round which might shorten the comments of some of us who&#13;
&#13;
 have not yet spoken.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    We had planned to listen.   We&#13;
&#13;
 have only two speakers left, at least right now on the&#13;
&#13;
 list, Ms. Zou and yourself.     I didn't want to lose too&#13;
&#13;
 many of you before you had heard each other and then have&#13;
&#13;
 staff to come back with a very full response.&#13;
&#13;
           Ms. Zou, please.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. ZOU:   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
           I think it is difficult to be a late speaker,&#13;
&#13;
 but I will still try to be brief and to minimize the&#13;
&#13;
 repetitions.&#13;
&#13;
           We too would like to commend the staff for&#13;
&#13;
 preparing these three interrelated papers, and each&#13;
&#13;
 contains very useful thinking.      Let me start with the&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction strategies.      Basically, we appreciate&#13;
&#13;
 the outcome-based approach.     We find it is appropriate for&#13;
&#13;
 this approach to serve as a policy base for the enhanced&#13;
&#13;
 HIPC framework.&#13;
&#13;
           However, we feel that this framework needs to be&#13;
&#13;
 further refined before it could be widely adapted to all&#13;
&#13;
 the borrowers.&#13;
                                                                 Page100&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           Regarding the overall approach, we find that&#13;
&#13;
 Table 1 is very interesting.      All the elements listed in&#13;
&#13;
 Table 1 are relevant to poverty reduction.         However, if&#13;
&#13;
 these elements need to be operationalized by the Bank, I&#13;
&#13;
 would again call for the selectivity, because if we look&#13;
&#13;
 at Table 1, there are four categories listed here.&#13;
&#13;
           My feeling is that probably the first two&#13;
&#13;
 categories gear mostly to the Bank's comparative advantage&#13;
&#13;
 and capacity, while the last two categories, some of the&#13;
&#13;
 items listed in the last two categories are obviously&#13;
&#13;
 beyond the Bank's mandate and internal capacity.        For&#13;
&#13;
 example, actions to reduce violence, the community&#13;
&#13;
 policing and something like this, obviously it must be&#13;
&#13;
 done by the government instead of the Bank.        So, I think&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank has to be selective in those areas.&#13;
&#13;
           Regarding the issue of governance, I fully agree&#13;
&#13;
 on the points made by Mr. Hyden that governance should be&#13;
&#13;
 more related to the way the government manages the&#13;
&#13;
 economy, instead of to link solely to the gray area of&#13;
&#13;
 empowerment, where we are not sure whether the Bank can&#13;
&#13;
 really make a difference.&#13;
&#13;
           Regarding the participation, we are in favor of&#13;
                                                                  Page101&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 the idea that the Bank should work directly with the poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 and to reflect the interest of those final stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
 Probably we feel that this might be a more effective way&#13;
&#13;
 of participation than going through NGOs as an&#13;
&#13;
 intermediary.&#13;
&#13;
           NGOs, however, could be helpful if the&#13;
&#13;
 participation of NGOs could be managed in a pragmatic way&#13;
&#13;
 and avoid potential political conflicts.             I would echo&#13;
&#13;
 those points made by Mr. Garcia in this regard.&#13;
&#13;
           And we also feel that the Bank needs to develop&#13;
&#13;
 certain guidelines and criteria for the NGO participation&#13;
&#13;
 so as to ensure accountability.         The Bank should choose&#13;
&#13;
 those NGOs with a good track record to work on the&#13;
&#13;
 development business as its partners.&#13;
&#13;
           Regarding the monitoring indicators, we feel&#13;
&#13;
 that indicators should be technically mature and avoid&#13;
&#13;
 using subjective judgment, particularly when involving the&#13;
&#13;
 qualitative indicators in social-related aspects.&#13;
&#13;
           Regarding the analytical tools on poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction, we feel that those tools need to be simple and&#13;
&#13;
 straight-forward.    My feeling is that the poverty notes&#13;
&#13;
 probably could be one section of the CAS, when necessary,&#13;
&#13;
 instead of being a new and independent tool.&#13;
                                                                     Page102&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           Now let me turn to the paper of HIPC.      We feel&#13;
&#13;
 that poverty reduction is the ultimate goal of the HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 Initiative.   Therefore, we support to strengthen the&#13;
&#13;
 linkage between debt relief and poverty reduction.      We&#13;
&#13;
 have three brief observations here.&#13;
&#13;
           We feel that strengthening the linkage to&#13;
&#13;
 poverty should not delay the debt relief process.      Our&#13;
&#13;
 desire is that the qualified HIPC countries should get as&#13;
&#13;
 soon as possible all the potential benefits from the HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 Initiative.   In this regard, we have no problem with the&#13;
&#13;
 transitional approach that the decision-making point could&#13;
&#13;
 take place even before the completion of the poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategy.&#13;
&#13;
           Number two, we believe that poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 cannot be delinked with financial resources.       Therefore,&#13;
&#13;
 we feel that we need to have a detailed country-specific&#13;
&#13;
 calculation on how much financial resources are actually&#13;
&#13;
 released by the enhanced framework on a cash flow basis.&#13;
&#13;
 And the performance target for the poverty alleviation&#13;
&#13;
 should be commensurate with the cash flow impact and&#13;
&#13;
 should not be over-ambitious.&#13;
&#13;
           In this regard, we also are worried a little bit&#13;
                                                                 Page103&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 about the possible imbalanced way of processing this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 enhanced framework, because we find that, on the one hand,&#13;
&#13;
 there are proactive, dynamic discussions on the poverty&#13;
&#13;
 linkage to this HIPC enhanced framework.           However, on the&#13;
&#13;
 other hand, the financial resources are still pending in&#13;
&#13;
 the air.   So, we would like to caution our colleagues on&#13;
&#13;
 this potential three-fold approach will definitely not&#13;
&#13;
 work.&#13;
&#13;
            Certainly, on the tripartite poverty strategy&#13;
&#13;
 paper, PRSP, we find this is a useful tool for HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 countries.   However, we are not yet convinced whether this&#13;
&#13;
 should be introduced to as wide a range of countries as&#13;
&#13;
 possible, because, like many other speakers mentioned,&#13;
&#13;
 this again evolved into a division of labor issue of the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank's and Fund's respective role in poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
 We need to avoid the risk of further blurring the division&#13;
&#13;
 of labor between the two institutions.&#13;
&#13;
            Finally, let me come to the paper of "Social and&#13;
&#13;
 Structural Reviews".   We appreciate the progress made and&#13;
&#13;
 the lessons learned over the one year's pilot for six&#13;
&#13;
 countries.   However, we are skeptical on the expansionary&#13;
&#13;
 way suggested in this paper.      We still remember that one&#13;
&#13;
 year ago, when we discussed to introduce the new tool of&#13;
                                                                      Page104&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 SPR, at the time there were a lot of concerns and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 hesitation from many chairs due to the complexity of the&#13;
&#13;
 issues the SPR is going to address.&#13;
&#13;
           And now, we have already expanded into the&#13;
&#13;
 social policy areas.     Although we have already had one&#13;
&#13;
 year's experience for the pilot, I believe we are still at&#13;
&#13;
 the beginning of the learning curve.        So, as the paper&#13;
&#13;
 also mentions, if we are going to expand into an effective&#13;
&#13;
 and useful one, we need more building blocks and&#13;
&#13;
 intellectual support from the ESW in different sector&#13;
&#13;
 issues.&#13;
&#13;
           However, obviously, we find the quality of the&#13;
&#13;
 ESW itself is still in question today.         So, given the&#13;
&#13;
 limited internal capacity of the Bank, as well as the&#13;
&#13;
 complexity and demanding nature of these structural and&#13;
&#13;
 social policy issues, we would be in favor of the idea&#13;
&#13;
 that the SSR will continue the pilot and still concentrate&#13;
&#13;
 on the structural issues and the social policies, when&#13;
&#13;
 necessary, and we make it better focused and do it better.&#13;

&#13;
           I will try at this stage to be down right&#13;
&#13;
 elliptical and simply signal support because I think all&#13;
&#13;
 of the issues have been well elaborated.           I have great&#13;
&#13;
 sympathy at this stage with the team and look forward to&#13;
&#13;
 answers to some of the questions.       But I think some of the&#13;
&#13;
 questions we have posed are real conundrums; they are not&#13;
&#13;
 ones you are going to be able to settle today but simply&#13;
&#13;
 kind of take into account in weighing as we go forward.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me start by simply saying that we can&#13;
&#13;
 support the broad thrust of the papers all taken together,&#13;
&#13;
 and especially single out a few areas for underscoring --&#13;
&#13;
 one, the emphasis on the comprehensive PRSP as a common&#13;
&#13;
 framework for Bank-Fund programs replacing the PFP.&#13;
&#13;
           I also agree with statements others have made on&#13;
&#13;
 the need for an emphasis on gender, particular focus on&#13;
&#13;
 gender in poverty analyses and strategies.          I think our&#13;
&#13;
 work over the years has documented very dramatically the&#13;
&#13;
 impact of our failure to understand gender differentiated&#13;
&#13;
 impacts, and we have a long way to go in that area, but we&#13;
&#13;
 must really integrate it in very carefully.&#13;
&#13;
           Also, the emphasis on outcomes is quite&#13;
&#13;
 important to us, on monitoring, on performance linkages,&#13;
                                                                   Page106&#13;

&#13;
 better and more participatory analysis of the incidence&#13;
&#13;
 and causes of poverty, although I certainly take the point&#13;
&#13;
 about how difficult it is to design effective&#13;
&#13;
 participatory approaches.      I think those complications&#13;
&#13;
 have been well elaborated in the interventions around this&#13;
&#13;
 table today.    Also, transparency and accountability are&#13;
&#13;
 likewise very critical.&#13;
&#13;
           I would make just four particular points on&#13;
&#13;
 these papers.   First, the need for Bank-Fund cooperation:&#13;
&#13;
 I think our lengthy discussion in the Steering Committee&#13;
&#13;
 yesterday of how trying to set up a single meeting to talk&#13;
&#13;
 about the HIPC framework because of the overlap in the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank and the Fund and getting it right, should be evidence&#13;
&#13;
 to us that this is easy to call for but will require of us&#13;
&#13;
 a great deal of work going forward.         And indeed, the&#13;
&#13;
 Fund's paper -- I didn't entirely appreciate the reference&#13;
&#13;
 to the Bank speed -- I think that may reflect perhaps a&#13;
&#13;
 bit of a lack of understanding of how complex it is when&#13;
&#13;
 you move into the social parameter design.          So, I just&#13;
&#13;
 underscore that and the need for cooperation.&#13;
&#13;
           I think the recently started joint committee is&#13;
&#13;
 helpful to at least begin to create greater symmetry in&#13;
                                                                  Page107&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 what a common set of shareholders is signalling in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 Fund and the Bank, because I recall Stan Fischer saying&#13;
&#13;
 that he often finds it hard to believe that, in fact, it&#13;
&#13;
 is a virtually identical set of shareholders, as he&#13;
&#13;
 follows the discussion of the same issues on both sides of&#13;
&#13;
 the street.   So, that is critical and we have a role to&#13;
&#13;
 play in that.&#13;
&#13;
           Second, I would like to caution that we not too&#13;
&#13;
 quickly dismiss, as the Bank's papers appear to do, the&#13;
&#13;
 possibility of directing HIPC savings and special stand-&#13;
&#13;
 alone poverty reduction or human development funds or&#13;
&#13;
 windows as some have called for.       I think properly&#13;
&#13;
 implemented in the context of transparent overall budget&#13;
&#13;
 procedures that are built on public expenditure reviews&#13;
&#13;
 and medium-term expenditure frameworks and that include&#13;
&#13;
 safeguards to ensure true additionality, such forums can&#13;
&#13;
 provide an important and a rational entry point for civil&#13;
&#13;
 society into decision-making that overcomes some of the&#13;
&#13;
 problems which have been cited in terms of when you open&#13;
&#13;
 it up to participation what structures that participation&#13;
&#13;
 and who are the legitimate participants.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I would just caution that we not too quickly&#13;
&#13;
 dismiss those vehicles, which in at least a couple of&#13;
                                                              Page108&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 instances have proven viable.      So, I think it would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 inappropriate for us to dismiss them too arbitrarily,&#13;
&#13;
 which links I think directly to another point, that the&#13;
&#13;
 success of this framework requires tremendous leadership&#13;
&#13;
 from Bank management.    I think we have got to be&#13;
&#13;
 forthright in saying that the incentives are not in place&#13;
&#13;
 yet fully in the Bank.    And in our examination of the&#13;
&#13;
 balance in the matrix structure between the networks and&#13;
&#13;
 over-arching corporate priorities -- and I would say&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction in that sense is an over-arching, cross-&#13;
&#13;
 cutting corporate priority -- vis-a-vis the immediate&#13;
&#13;
 priorities of a Country Director at a given point in time,&#13;
&#13;
 we have all acknowledged that we don't have that balance&#13;
&#13;
 yet entirely well calibrated or honed.&#13;
&#13;
           That becomes especially critical as a constraint&#13;
&#13;
 when we talk about strengthening our poverty reduction.     I&#13;
&#13;
 think we simply have to keep it on the list as something&#13;
&#13;
 that, if we are going to do this, we are going to have to&#13;
&#13;
 accelerate the effort to do some pragmatic problem solving&#13;
&#13;
 on how to assure that this kind of a commitment translates&#13;
&#13;
 into direct incentives and performance evaluation measures&#13;
&#13;
 for staff in country units as well as in the networks.&#13;
&#13;
           This chair would explicitly want to say that we&#13;
                                                                 Page109&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 think it is too soon to agree on budget support lending&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 instruments and, since the paper anticipates that, we want&#13;
&#13;
 to make it clear that we don't think the case has yet&#13;
&#13;
 effectively been made.&#13;
&#13;
           I also want to recognize that the development&#13;
&#13;
 and implementation of PRSPs will take time.        This is going&#13;
&#13;
 to require capacity building in governments and in the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank.   This shouldn't be though an excuse for delays.      We&#13;
&#13;
 need to begin this urgently, and I thought the paper&#13;
&#13;
 perhaps overstressed a bit the complexity at the cost of&#13;
&#13;
 recognizing the essentiality of really moving with&#13;
&#13;
 dispatch to do this, because we have all committed to HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 relief based on performance, not promises.&#13;
&#13;
           And unless we can identify at least some&#13;
&#13;
 proxies, recognizing that results will take time and there&#13;
&#13;
 is an inherent tension between the desire for upfront debt&#13;
&#13;
 relief, on the one hand, and the time required to realize&#13;
&#13;
 results, on the other, in a results-based approach, I&#13;
&#13;
 think part of the way around that is country-specific&#13;
&#13;
 input-based measures as a kind of interim proxy.       And I&#13;
&#13;
 think we really have got to struggle further to find those&#13;
&#13;
 imperfect but workable measures.&#13;
&#13;
           In this regard, I would urge that we all&#13;
                                                                    Page110&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 integrate into the discussion the tremendous work that OED&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 has done.    And I think in some of their evaluations that&#13;
&#13;
 we sometimes insufficiently integrate into our operational&#13;
&#13;
 design, there is a lot of material which is directly&#13;
&#13;
 relevant to what selections we make on indicators going&#13;
&#13;
 forward.    So, I would commend that to all of our&#13;
&#13;
 attention.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:   Thank you very much, Jan.&#13;
&#13;
             Does anyone else want to come in at this stage&#13;
&#13;
 or should we first hear from staff?&#13;
&#13;
             [No response.]&#13;
&#13;
             MR. SANDSTROM:   So, why don't we hear from staff&#13;
&#13;
 and then you can come back with any further comments or&#13;
&#13;
 statements.&#13;
&#13;
             Masood will organize the answers, organize the&#13;
&#13;
 questions and answers and lead off.         We will also call on&#13;
&#13;
 IMF staff to react and respond to the questions that have&#13;
&#13;
 been raised and to give their perspective.&#13;
&#13;
             So, Masood.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. AHMED:    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
             Thank you all for those comments.       And what I&#13;
&#13;
 might do is really pick up on one general point which I&#13;
                                                                    Page111&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 think comes through in a lot of interventions.         And then,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 I thought that what I would do is ask our colleagues from&#13;
&#13;
 the Fund, particularly Russell Kincaid, to come and talk&#13;
&#13;
 specifically about a couple of issues that were raised,&#13;
&#13;
 the balancing of macro and the social objectives and how&#13;
&#13;
 we can do that while preserving the macro stability&#13;
&#13;
 objective, and also the issue of collaboration, and in&#13;
&#13;
 terms from their perspective, how do see that.     A number&#13;
&#13;
 of people have raised that.&#13;
&#13;
           I think it was Helena who said that this would&#13;
&#13;
 imply a sort of dramatic change in the way in which the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank works.   I think certainly from my interactions in&#13;
&#13;
 talking to my colleagues in the Fund, they will come and&#13;
&#13;
 tell you that in some ways it also implies pretty dramatic&#13;
&#13;
 difference in the way in which the Fund will be working.&#13;
&#13;
 It will be useful to get that perspective.&#13;
&#13;
           And I thought I would ask Peter to pick up on&#13;
&#13;
 some of the specific HIPC-related issues, in particular&#13;
&#13;
 whether or not the points that have been raised about&#13;
&#13;
 whether this new approach will be too burdensome for some&#13;
&#13;
 the HIPC countries to apply, and how do we balance the&#13;
&#13;
 speed, the desire that is coming through that you don't&#13;
&#13;
 delay debt relief and yet begin to phase in this new&#13;
                                                               Page112&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 approach in a pragmatic way, and also the link between the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 PFP, the PRSP and the CAS and how these things fit&#13;
&#13;
 together, it would be good to get that.&#13;
&#13;
           Then, I think I will ask John to pick up on the&#13;
&#13;
 questions related to the SSRs which a number of you have&#13;
&#13;
 raised, what their focus is, how poverty overlays the core&#13;
&#13;
 content and how they relate to other building blocks, as&#13;
&#13;
 well as to this issue of the proliferation of various&#13;
&#13;
 products and how we try and consolidate them.      And I will&#13;
&#13;
 ask him to be brief in response to Mr. Ghattas because&#13;
&#13;
 that is what John asked him to do and then Mike to pick up&#13;
&#13;
 on the other issues that relate to it.&#13;
&#13;
           The general point I wanted to make though is&#13;
&#13;
 really the following.    What you have before you is an&#13;
&#13;
 approach that has conceptually I think now been laid out.&#13;
&#13;
 Maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but in my own mind, if I&#13;
&#13;
 look back six months and look at what we have today, I&#13;
&#13;
 think this conceptual approach represents a significant&#13;
&#13;
 advance not only in terms of pulling together our own&#13;
&#13;
 material but also in terms of pulling together the way in&#13;
&#13;
 which the Bank and the Fund and other partners can support&#13;
&#13;
 countries in moving towards a common objective in a much&#13;
&#13;
 more concerted, coherent framework.&#13;
                                                                 Page113&#13;

&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           So, I think on the conceptual level the elements&#13;
&#13;
 of it have been thought through and are laid out for you,&#13;
&#13;
 and I think we have had broad endorsement of it.    But it&#13;
&#13;
 is still very much at the conceptual level in many places.&#13;
&#13;
           And, as we move forward over the next couple of&#13;
&#13;
 years, I think you will find that it is in at least three&#13;
&#13;
 different ways going to have to be fleshed out.    First,&#13;
&#13;
 the analytics of it, as we operationalize, this whole idea&#13;
&#13;
 of what constitute the relevant set of indicators, how do&#13;
&#13;
 you use outcome indicators and what kind of proxy&#13;
&#13;
 indicators work or don't work well; how do you actually&#13;
&#13;
 try and look at the content, the points that were raised&#13;
&#13;
 by Mr. Hyden and others about how do play certain&#13;
&#13;
 elements, you know, is governance one part of it or is it&#13;
&#13;
 over-arching.&#13;
&#13;
           All of these things we are going to have to work&#13;
&#13;
 through and some of those rough edges are not only there&#13;
&#13;
 now, but my sense is that this is a new frontier for a lot&#13;
&#13;
 of people, trying to work through those relationships.&#13;
&#13;
           Secondly, in terms as we move forward to apply&#13;
&#13;
 it, it is going to be a function of capacity, the capacity&#13;
&#13;
 in countries to be able to develop this kind of&#13;
                                                              Page114&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 participative process and the content and the dialogue on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 it, the capacity in civil society to play the role that&#13;
&#13;
 many of you are saying it ought to be playing and that we&#13;
&#13;
 I think are suggesting it plays in the design of this, the&#13;
&#13;
 capacity inside the Bank and in our partners who work with&#13;
&#13;
 it to try and follow through in supporting countries in&#13;
&#13;
 these areas.   We don't have that kind of range of&#13;
&#13;
 expertise yet onboard and we will be building and training&#13;
&#13;
 capacity there.&#13;
&#13;
           The third dimension is behavior, culture.   But&#13;
&#13;
 in some ways this is about a different way of relating and&#13;
&#13;
 doing business.   And there is a set of behavioral changes&#13;
&#13;
 implied in this in the way in which different parties&#13;
&#13;
 interact in the design of country strategies within the&#13;
&#13;
 country, in the way in which we, the Bank and the Fund,&#13;
&#13;
 not only work with each other but, much more importantly,&#13;
&#13;
 actually make our processes and our products in some sense&#13;
&#13;
 in timetables contingent upon the pace at which countries&#13;
&#13;
 are able to move forward.&#13;
&#13;
           I think much of the discussion about whether we&#13;
&#13;
 have been timely in responding to the Fund, you know, we&#13;
&#13;
 can talk about it, I am happy to come back to that.   But I&#13;
&#13;
 think a much more interesting question is going to be:&#13;
                                                               Page115&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 How will we both be timely in responding to the pace at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 which countries move?    And that timely means not only&#13;
&#13;
 being too slow but being too fast.        Because I think the&#13;
&#13;
 real behavioral change that we will have to work through&#13;
&#13;
 is recognizing that in some cases pushing for speed at our&#13;
&#13;
 timetable will undermine the very process of ownership&#13;
&#13;
 that we are trying to foster through this.&#13;
&#13;
           So, I think there is a whole set of behavioral&#13;
&#13;
 issues there and internal behavioral issues which are&#13;
&#13;
 going to be partly related to the respective roles of&#13;
&#13;
 center and Country Directors, incentives that reinforce&#13;
&#13;
 those behavioral changes.&#13;
&#13;
           I don't have today any kind of simple rules of&#13;
&#13;
 thumb or options that I can say this is how we are going&#13;
&#13;
 to really ensure that those behavioral changes take place&#13;
&#13;
 within the Bank except to say the things that you have&#13;
&#13;
 pointed out, that you can work on a number of levers to&#13;
&#13;
 push on those.   The are incentives, the way in which we do&#13;
&#13;
 evaluations, it is the management attention, it is the&#13;
&#13;
 celebration of those who are moving forward more quickly&#13;
&#13;
 than others.&#13;
&#13;
           I think what you will see over the next year or&#13;
&#13;
 two is a messy, patchy, uneven process coming to you.&#13;
                                                                 Page116&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 be much stronger in terms of being grounded in this&#13;
&#13;
 framework than others.     I say that now because I think it&#13;
&#13;
 is very important that, while we adhere firmly to the&#13;
&#13;
 objectives of where we are trying to go with this&#13;
&#13;
 framework, if you endorse it, we recognize that the&#13;
&#13;
 process of getting there for these very reasons is going&#13;
&#13;
 to be an uneven and sort of phasing-in process.         And we&#13;
&#13;
 will have two systems in some ways running in parallel for&#13;
&#13;
 a period.&#13;
&#13;
             I mean, in some countries you may see a PFP and&#13;
&#13;
 in others a PRSP, and you might legitimately ask why do&#13;
&#13;
 you have these two still coexisting.         And I think the&#13;
&#13;
 answer will be that one was just ready to go and the other&#13;
&#13;
 wasn't.&#13;
&#13;
             So, I say this as a prelude to getting specific&#13;
&#13;
 answers because in some ways some of the answers you will&#13;
&#13;
 get will still show the same rough edges that the papers&#13;
&#13;
 themselves show in terms of where we are and how we begin&#13;
&#13;
 to phase in this approach over the next year and eighteen&#13;
&#13;
 months.&#13;
&#13;
             So, with that, I thought I might ask Russell to&#13;
&#13;
 sort of say from his perspective, from the Fund, how&#13;
                                                                  Page117&#13;

&#13;
           MR. KINCAID:     Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me say at the outset that the Fund staff&#13;
&#13;
 that has been working on both the HIPC Initiative but also&#13;
&#13;
 the social sector questions and ESAF arrangements and&#13;
&#13;
 policies more generally work quite closely with their Bank&#13;
&#13;
 counterparts in commenting on the Bank's papers that are&#13;
&#13;
 before you today, but also in reacting and accommodating&#13;
&#13;
 the Bank's comments on their own papers.             And this has&#13;
&#13;
 been I think a very fruitful collaboration.&#13;
&#13;
           We have come a long way in the last six months.&#13;
&#13;
 And there, I very much share Masood's remarks on that.&#13;
&#13;
           I would also like to say that several Directors&#13;
&#13;
 here have commented that the poverty reduction strategy&#13;
&#13;
 papers imply a shift in the way the Bank works, a very&#13;
&#13;
 fundamental shift.     And I think that is right.         They also&#13;
&#13;
 imply a very fundamental shift in the way the Fund works&#13;
&#13;
 and works not only internally but with the Bank.            And that&#13;
&#13;
 I think is recognized at all levels within the two&#13;
&#13;
 institutions.&#13;
&#13;
           I don't think we have answers to all the&#13;
&#13;
 questions about how the processes need to change, but I&#13;
&#13;
 think there is a very clear means of communication going&#13;
                                                                        Page118&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 on at this stage.&#13;
&#13;

                           507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                         Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                             (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           In that context, let me share with you something&#13;
&#13;
 which our management, the Managing Director has said to&#13;
&#13;
 our Board, which will be part of the dialogue and the&#13;
&#13;
 discussion the Fund's Executive Board will have on Monday.&#13;
&#13;
 That is that it is recognized that the ambitious proposals&#13;
&#13;
 that are put forward for the HIPC countries have&#13;
&#13;
 implications for how the Fund supports all low-income&#13;
&#13;
 developing countries; that is, how the Fund's ESAF&#13;
&#13;
 programs work, in general.&#13;
&#13;
           And therefore, the management of the Fund has&#13;
&#13;
 talked about the need to adapt ESAF arrangements.      In&#13;
&#13;
 fact, it was even proposed that the whole facility be&#13;
&#13;
 renamed to reflect the fact that this will be a reformed&#13;
&#13;
 ESAF that is going to come out of this process.&#13;
&#13;
           We are in the opening stages of that discussion&#13;
&#13;
 within the Fund.   So, it is really not possible for me to&#13;
&#13;
 go into great detail.     But I think it is clear from our&#13;
&#13;
 perspective and I think from the Bank's that the PFP&#13;
&#13;
 process has not worked well.       There are weaknesses there&#13;
&#13;
 and it needs to be replaced.       And the poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategy paper I think is the instrument that we think&#13;
&#13;
 would be a useful replacement.       And I will leave my Bank&#13;
                                                                 Page119&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 colleagues to expand about that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           But that is the perspective that certainly is&#13;
&#13;
 shared on the Fund side, and we are looking very much&#13;
&#13;
 forward to seeing more input from the Bank in this&#13;
&#13;
 process, not only in terms of what I would say would be&#13;
&#13;
 the medium-term budgetary strategies of these countries&#13;
&#13;
 but in the annual budgetary processes and in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
 priorities, the quality of spending.        This is where the&#13;
&#13;
 Fund staff sees the greatest need at the moment for Bank&#13;
&#13;
 staff input, because that is really the nitty-gritty&#13;
&#13;
 choices that a country faces each year.            And particularly&#13;
&#13;
 if there is an external shock and there is a need for&#13;
&#13;
 budgetary adjustments, different than had been expected in&#13;
&#13;
 the medium-term plan, well, what is going to give?&#13;
&#13;
           And here, I think the authorities and the Fund&#13;
&#13;
 staff in a participatory process want to have greater&#13;
&#13;
 input at a technical level as well as in a social,&#13;
&#13;
 political context.&#13;
&#13;
           It is both of these aspects that we want to see&#13;
&#13;
 strengthened -- the expertise coming from the Bank but&#13;
&#13;
 also a more open and consultative process.           This is very&#13;
&#13;
 much I think in line with what you are talking about here&#13;
&#13;
 at the Bank.&#13;
                                                                       Page120&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
            From our own side, we recognize that the setting&#13;
&#13;
 of macroeconomic objectives, fiscal targets needs to be an&#13;
&#13;
 iterative process, a process that takes onboard what the&#13;
&#13;
 objectives are for poverty reduction in the social area,&#13;
&#13;
 but more broadly development objectives.           But what the&#13;
&#13;
 Fund needs and what the authorities need I think are a&#13;
&#13;
 clearer idea of what the costs are, the resource costs,&#13;
&#13;
 the budgetary costs of all of these programs are, and also&#13;
&#13;
 the priorities that need to be assigned.&#13;
&#13;
            And that is a very important part of this&#13;
&#13;
 process.   And there, there is scope in the fiscal envelope&#13;
&#13;
 and in the macro framework to make adjustments.          Now how&#13;
&#13;
 much, that will have to be decided in each individual&#13;
&#13;
 case.   But what we see as going on is an iterative process&#13;
&#13;
 -- Bank, Fund and the authorities trying to work out what&#13;
&#13;
 is optimal for this country, recognizing that macro&#13;
&#13;
 stability and low inflation have positive effects on&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction and on growth.&#13;
&#13;
            Many of these countries, particularly HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 countries, became highly indebted because they had&#13;
&#13;
 unsustainable fiscal policies.      So, we want to make sure&#13;
&#13;
 that fiscal policies are sustainable.         And that is I think&#13;
                                                                     Page121&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           I guess in responding to the two questions that&#13;
&#13;
 were put to me, we see a need for these changes at the&#13;
&#13;
 Fund.   We are going to work very hard in the days ahead to&#13;
&#13;
 come up with some of the -- I won't call them answers --&#13;
&#13;
 but come up with some of the processes, some of the&#13;
&#13;
 approaches that allow some the ragged edges that we now&#13;
&#13;
 have before us to become smooth.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. AHMED:    Peter.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. FALLON:   Okay.    Thank you very much.   And&#13;
&#13;
 let me say again how much we very much appreciate the&#13;
&#13;
 comments from the Executive Directors on our papers.      This&#13;
&#13;
 is really very encouraging and a very nice position to be&#13;
&#13;
 in.&#13;
&#13;
           I am just going to talk about two things.      One,&#13;
&#13;
 I think was -- and this came out from several speakers --&#13;
&#13;
 about the burdensome nature or will all of this business&#13;
&#13;
 over-burden poor countries and perhaps the HIPC countries&#13;
&#13;
 which tend to be particularly poor.&#13;
&#13;
           And I think in a way the answer has partly&#13;
&#13;
 actually come out of the comments of various Executive&#13;
&#13;
 Directors.   I mean, in a way, at the very end this is&#13;
                                                                  Page122&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 going to be a tradeoff situation.       On the one hand, yes,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 we don't want to delay getting relief and helping these&#13;
&#13;
 countries.   On the other hand, to put it rather crudely&#13;
&#13;
 and in a rather English way, we don't want to give&#13;
&#13;
 something away totally for nothing.        We do want to see&#13;
&#13;
 this as integrated into a poverty reduction strategy which&#13;
&#13;
 is long-term and going to have long-term benefits.&#13;
&#13;
           Now quite clearly, when you are dealing with a&#13;
&#13;
 situation like this, you are looking for some form of&#13;
&#13;
 compromise, though I suspect the nature of the compromise&#13;
&#13;
 will probably change as we move through.&#13;
&#13;
           Let me just make two or three comments on being&#13;
&#13;
 burdensome, over-burdening I find easier to pronounce.&#13;
&#13;
 First of all, in fact, it relates to another question and&#13;
&#13;
 that is, in some sense, will HIPC be enough?       Will there&#13;
&#13;
 be enough resources?    Well, the answer is even with HIPC,&#13;
&#13;
 with domestic resources, these remain very poor countries&#13;
&#13;
 and the amount of investments that can be placed on&#13;
&#13;
 various poverty reduction actions are obviously limited.&#13;
&#13;
           That forces the pragmatism in one way.       With&#13;
&#13;
 limited resources, this tends to mean, of course, that you&#13;
&#13;
 tend to seek a few really key priorities and to&#13;
&#13;
 concentrate on those.    That is one kind of constraint that&#13;
                                                                 Page123&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 comes across.&#13;

                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
            A second one I think is the participatory&#13;
&#13;
 process.   We have reflected in the documents, and I&#13;
&#13;
 reflected this this morning, we expect this actually to&#13;
&#13;
 help.   One of the problems we have, particularly in the&#13;
&#13;
 poorer countries, we often don't know what NGOs or what&#13;
&#13;
 various donor agencies are actually doing.          One thing this&#13;
&#13;
 might do is actually put this information basis together&#13;
&#13;
 to design the process and then later easier to implement&#13;
&#13;
 the process as it unfolds.&#13;
&#13;
            Thirdly, this point was made very well I think&#13;
&#13;
 by the Dutch chair, the World Bank and the IMF probably&#13;
&#13;
 just cannot do all of this on their own.           We are hoping,&#13;
&#13;
 in fact, that the design and the monitoring and all of&#13;
&#13;
 these things will be shared between the Bank, the Fund and&#13;
&#13;
 other relevant agencies.    In that sense, the burden we see&#13;
&#13;
 as being shared and spread rather more perhaps than at the&#13;
&#13;
 present time.&#13;
&#13;
            The compromise, as I said, will shift over time.&#13;
&#13;
 It is definitely then going to be a transitional process,&#13;
&#13;
 and John Sinclair said, well, he would like to know&#13;
&#13;
 staff's view on how the new HIPCs will be handled.          I&#13;
&#13;
 don't think staff really have a clear view right at this&#13;
                                                                      Page124&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 point on a case-by-case kind of basis.&#13;

                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
             Initially, the compromise will have to be -- if&#13;
&#13;
 we think of it -- on a scale a bit towards the idea of,&#13;
&#13;
 look, we don't want to create unnecessary delay; we&#13;
&#13;
 recognize that a good strategy will take time to&#13;
&#13;
 formulate; it will take time to put into place.       And we&#13;
&#13;
 don't want to hold people up.&#13;
&#13;
             As we move along the scale over time, I suspect&#13;
&#13;
 that we will begin to tighten.       I suspect that, as we have&#13;
&#13;
 said, today that, while it is desirable basically that a&#13;
&#13;
 strategy be in place at the decision point but it is not&#13;
&#13;
 really absolutely essential, I predict -- it is just a&#13;
&#13;
 personal prediction -- that a few years down the road it&#13;
&#13;
 will be the case that it will have to be in place at the&#13;
&#13;
 decision point.    In other words, I anticipate that this&#13;
&#13;
 will tighten gradually over time in what we hope is a&#13;
&#13;
 demonstrated success of what we are trying to do.&#13;
&#13;
             The point about transition and moving over time&#13;
&#13;
 I think also applies to the question of the PRSP and the&#13;
&#13;
 PFP.   We do recognize that the PFP is not going to die&#13;
&#13;
 tomorrow.    There will be countries that will have PFPs and&#13;
&#13;
 gradually bringing PRSPs in.&#13;
&#13;
             But let me just address perhaps briefly the&#13;
                                                                   Page125&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 question of why trying to do it.        Remember, we are trying&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 to introduce a new enhanced framework, which is going to&#13;
&#13;
 be participatory, it is going to have a consistency for&#13;
&#13;
 the first time we believe between the macro, the&#13;
&#13;
 structural and what sometimes is called the social -- I&#13;
&#13;
 would rather say other poverty reduction components.&#13;
&#13;
           The idea of the PRSP is this is going to be, if&#13;
&#13;
 you like, a flagship document, which is going to be&#13;
&#13;
 published, it is going to be a tripartite document, owned&#13;
&#13;
 by the government.   It is going to basically contain all&#13;
&#13;
 of the indicators that are used, largely perhaps&#13;
&#13;
 intermediate indicators.    As we stressed and some speakers&#13;
&#13;
 have stressed, we are looking at initially short time&#13;
&#13;
 frames and we, of course, have to work with intermediates&#13;
&#13;
 rather than outcomes for purely practical reasons.&#13;
&#13;
           A big point about this is we expect -- and this&#13;
&#13;
 is the linkage to the CAS -- the CAS would take the&#13;
&#13;
 strategy and basically would judge progress under the&#13;
&#13;
 strategy for its lending instruments.         We also hope -- it&#13;
&#13;
 may not happen -- that other institutions would start to&#13;
&#13;
 use this document in much the same way.&#13;
&#13;
           Our comparators with the PFP, I have written&#13;
&#13;
 three PFPs -- I won't say for which country -- some time&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 fundamentally a shadow document to what was then the SAF&#13;
&#13;
 and later the ESAF.    The PFP was a document really without&#13;
&#13;
 any particular kind of teeth.&#13;
&#13;
           I understand over time it has become an even&#13;
&#13;
 paler shadow.   It is taken not terribly seriously by Bank&#13;
&#13;
 staff.   There have been surveys of this.          We suspect there&#13;
&#13;
 is not much ownership on the part of governments.&#13;
&#13;
           Now, we could do all the things in the PRSP and&#13;
&#13;
 still call it a PFP and just make this change.          We&#13;
&#13;
 suggested this idea.    There was a feeling though that,&#13;
&#13;
 since we are making a real discrete change at the present&#13;
&#13;
 time, we really need a change in the title to signal this,&#13;
&#13;
 much the same way as my colleague from the Fund said          they&#13;
&#13;
 may change the title of the ESAF, because that is changing&#13;
&#13;
 its particular nature.&#13;

           Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. PAGE:    Well, I have been given the task of&#13;
&#13;
 trying to be brief in addressing the relationship between&#13;
&#13;
 our diagnostic instruments in country strategies --&#13;
&#13;
 unfortunately, Marcos is not here to grade me on my&#13;
&#13;
 performance; so I hope you will report back to him later.&#13;
&#13;
           The first set of issues really have to do with&#13;
                                                                       Page127&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 poverty-focused country assistance strategies.          Put very&#13;
&#13;
 simply, we see these as the tools by which Country&#13;
&#13;
 Directors and country teams can achieve a more systematic&#13;
&#13;
 analysis of the issues in their countries and a better&#13;
&#13;
 strategic focus.&#13;
&#13;
             In a way, it is answering the first question of&#13;
&#13;
 good strategic planning, which is where do we want to go.&#13;
&#13;
 It is a help for that particular purpose.           We do not see&#13;
&#13;
 these instruments really in a sense as ends in themselves.&#13;
&#13;
 And I want to assure Directors that we don't see a poverty&#13;
&#13;
 note substituting for a poverty-focused CAS, nor do we see&#13;
&#13;
 a social and structural review as in any way undermining&#13;
&#13;
 the need to have then a well-focused country strategy and,&#13;
&#13;
 within that, a well-focused Bank country assistance&#13;
&#13;
 strategy.    These are tools to do the job.&#13;
&#13;
             The second question, of course, in strategic&#13;
&#13;
 planning is:    How do we get there?       And that question is&#13;
&#13;
 really the one in which we have to bring the array of&#13;
&#13;
 matrix services that we have discussed today, the role of&#13;
&#13;
 the networks in really supporting the regions and Country&#13;
&#13;
 Directors in setting strategic priorities within the&#13;
&#13;
 broader country assistance framework.&#13;
                                                                     Page128&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           That brings us, of course, to the question of&#13;
&#13;
 the role of instruments.     Which instruments do we deploy?&#13;
&#13;
 Those are I think very much a country-based set of&#13;
&#13;
 decisions that have to be made.        We note some Directors'&#13;
&#13;
 concerns with respect to budgetary support instruments,&#13;
&#13;
 but please note that there is nothing in this strategy&#13;
&#13;
 that presupposes any selection of instruments.       The tools&#13;
&#13;
 have to befit the task.&#13;
&#13;
           It also speaks to the issue of capacity building&#13;
&#13;
 in our own analytical and advisory services.        And here,&#13;
&#13;
 let me take a slight exception with our colleague from the&#13;
&#13;
 Fund.   One of the things that I think we have tried to&#13;
&#13;
 demonstrate to you in the past two years is that,&#13;
&#13;
 particularly in the critical area of public expenditure,&#13;
&#13;
 which in some ways is one of the key links between public&#13;
&#13;
 actions and poverty outcomes, the Bank is moving well&#13;
&#13;
 beyond the mere certification of public expenditure&#13;
&#13;
 programs, if you like, the old traditional shooting of&#13;
&#13;
 white elephants.&#13;
&#13;
           To answer the question that I always got when I&#13;
&#13;
 was a Chief Economist:     How do we keep from making the&#13;
&#13;
 same bad decisions the next time?        The issue is really to&#13;
                                                                   Page129&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 selectivity and better prioritization of the public&#13;
&#13;
 expenditure programs.     Certification is a part of that but&#13;
&#13;
 it is not the end of that.      And I wouldn't like to leave&#13;
&#13;
 an impression with Directors that we are simply going to&#13;
&#13;
 be engaged in a process of certifying public expenditure&#13;
&#13;
 programs.    That is not the objective of our work in public&#13;
&#13;
 sector development and public expenditure.&#13;
&#13;
             To come to the role of the SSR, the fundamental&#13;
&#13;
 concept of the SSR is systematic coverage of a set of&#13;
&#13;
 questions dealing with the underpinnings of the market&#13;
&#13;
 economy -- social and structural -- but within an&#13;
&#13;
 integrating framework, the integrating framework being the&#13;
&#13;
 objective of poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
             So, it is not that we are trying to create a&#13;
&#13;
 poverty instrument or a poverty reduction instrument in&#13;
&#13;
 the SSR, but to actually provide an over-arching framework&#13;
&#13;
 within which we can understand structural and social&#13;
&#13;
 issues and be more selective in the process of answering&#13;
&#13;
 the question of where do we want to go.&#13;
&#13;
             It is a very interesting case that in the six&#13;
&#13;
 pilot studies the question of ownership has evolved.       It&#13;
&#13;
 is no secret to many of you that some countries were&#13;
                                                                 Page130&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 would be used.   What we have found is that, as these&#13;
&#13;
 social and structural reviews have been undertaken, as&#13;
&#13;
 governments have been engaged in the process of design, as&#13;
&#13;
 we would do with any process of economic and sector work,&#13;
&#13;
 we have had substantially greater buy-in over the course&#13;
&#13;
 of the pilot period than in the initiation of the social&#13;
&#13;
 and structural review process.      That is seen by the fact&#13;
&#13;
 that we now have I think received clearance from all&#13;
&#13;
 governments to bring those documents to the Board.         They&#13;
&#13;
 are now formally parts of ESW.&#13;
&#13;
           When we began, we said to them you can choose,&#13;
&#13;
 and many of them said let's wait and see.          The answer has&#13;
&#13;
 been we are quite satisfied with this process and believe&#13;
&#13;
 it has taken onboard our concerns about balance and about&#13;
&#13;
 perspective, many of those concerns expressed by the&#13;
&#13;
 Chinese chair today.&#13;
&#13;
           Given that evolving relationship, it is also&#13;
&#13;
 interesting to ask what have they been used for?         And here&#13;
&#13;
 I would like to call your attention to the Dominican&#13;
&#13;
 Republic SSR which is a particularly interesting example&#13;
&#13;
 of an SSR in a CDF country.     The current proposal on the&#13;
&#13;
 table from government is to actually use that as one of&#13;
                                                                     Page131&#13;

&#13;
 undertaken among all the parties within the Dominican&#13;
&#13;
 Republic -- political and civil society organizations --&#13;
&#13;
 on forming a vision, but a national vision of where the DR&#13;
&#13;
 wants to go.   So, this has become a document which is not&#13;
&#13;
 only in some sense owned by government and the Bank but is&#13;
&#13;
 going to be used to try to build a new level of consensus&#13;
&#13;
 at the level of the society in terms of a country strategy&#13;
&#13;
 focused on poverty reduction, incorporating the&#13;
&#13;
 underpinnings of the market economy.&#13;
&#13;
           I think that is where we would like to go with&#13;
&#13;
 SSRs, a tool which can help in this process of forming a&#13;
&#13;
 vision of where countries wish to go.&#13;
&#13;
           Where will we go in practice?            We have eight to&#13;
&#13;
 ten country teams who have asked for further work on SSRs&#13;
&#13;
 in the coming year.   We will begin by supporting those.&#13;
&#13;
 As we learn more from that process and as we learn from&#13;
&#13;
 this process of developing poverty-focused country&#13;
&#13;
 strategies, we will come back to you with further&#13;
&#13;
 recommendations as to whether management wishes to move&#13;
&#13;
 further in the implementation of this particular tool.&#13;
&#13;
           Finally, let me very briefly address the&#13;
&#13;
 alphabet soup of analytical acronyms.         You are right,&#13;
                                                                       Page132&#13;

&#13;
 change all the time.   Even I cannot keep track of them.&#13;
&#13;
 It makes me feel like I am back in the U.S. Navy.&#13;
&#13;
            We will try in the course of the coming year to&#13;
&#13;
 do what Joanne Salop calls "business-ify" our ESW program.&#13;
&#13;
 In doing that, what we will do is reduce the number of&#13;
&#13;
 standard ESW products which we offer both to country teams&#13;
&#13;
 and to client countries, to develop a set of network&#13;
&#13;
 support services to those to ensure greater coherence and&#13;
&#13;
 comparability among them and greater quality assurance&#13;
&#13;
 from the network side.&#13;
&#13;
            At the same time, let me point out that, as we&#13;
&#13;
 do that, and reduce the range of these products, which&#13;
&#13;
 would be in a sense the building blocks identified by the&#13;
&#13;
 SSR type product of critical areas that are constraints to&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction, we will also have to maintain a&#13;
&#13;
 balance.&#13;
&#13;
            Because, as many of you know, much of our&#13;
&#13;
 analytical and advisory work today is not done in the form&#13;
&#13;
 of formal ESW products but just in-time policy notes and&#13;
&#13;
 other responses to emerging needs.        And while we move&#13;
&#13;
 toward greater standardization, on the one hand, I think&#13;
&#13;
 we also have to maintain a balance to be sure that we are&#13;
                                                               Page133&#13;

             Nevertheless, I hope that within a year's time&#13;
&#13;
 we can come back to you and assure you that we have&#13;
&#13;
 reduced the number of alphabetical combinations, and that&#13;
&#13;
 you can also have greater confidence that when you look at&#13;
&#13;
 one of these particular acronyms, you know more or less&#13;
&#13;
 what it is going to contain and you have a better sense of&#13;
&#13;
 what its quality will be and what its content will be.&#13;
&#13;
             So, I think in that sense we hear you, we share&#13;
&#13;
 the same concern and we are trying to respond.&#13;
&#13;
             MR. WALTON:   Thank you very much.      I will be&#13;
&#13;
 really quick.    People get nervous when you say that.&#13;
&#13;
             First, to reaffirm we have got two processes&#13;
&#13;
 going on.    What we are really talking about today is a&#13;
&#13;
 very practical process of how you do business in countries&#13;
&#13;
 and in sectors.    I would like to reaffirm that what we are&#13;
&#13;
 building on today is a lot of what is beginning in&#13;
&#13;
 different countries, different sectors in the Bank but it&#13;
&#13;
 needs to be extended and that, of course, will take time.&#13;
&#13;
             I want to pick up one issue within that, and&#13;
&#13;
 that was raised by a number of Directors, and that is&#13;
&#13;
 goals, how they are set, and just to reaffirm that we see&#13;
&#13;
 a strong complementarity between participative processes&#13;
                                                                 Page134&#13;

&#13;
 are relevant to that society, and a technical process&#13;
&#13;
 which will define the tradeoffs and define what works and&#13;
&#13;
 does not work from international experience.       Often that&#13;
&#13;
 will involve, and we take note, issues of employment,&#13;
&#13;
 issues of poverty lines, but that will have to be defined&#13;
&#13;
 on a country-by-country basis.&#13;
&#13;
           The next point, we certainly take note of a lot&#13;
&#13;
 of substantive issues that were raised about how we can&#13;
&#13;
 continue to learn about what is important and what matters&#13;
&#13;
 in poverty reduction strategies.       Just to cite a few,&#13;
&#13;
 there is a lot of resonance with the central issue of&#13;
&#13;
 distribution, questions of how you confront issues of&#13;
&#13;
 asset inequality, what is really meant by empowerment, how&#13;
&#13;
 that may relate to issues of conflict, the fact that&#13;
&#13;
 governance is certainly not just about empowerment but it&#13;
&#13;
 cuts across everything, and that there is a powerful&#13;
&#13;
 interrelation about issues that gender is central both in&#13;
&#13;
 terms of the dimensions of poverty and its process.&#13;
&#13;
           The only thing I will say about this is this&#13;
&#13;
 will be a central part of the debate over the coming year.&#13;
&#13;
 And this forum will start next Friday -- or the next phase&#13;
&#13;
 will be next Friday in the discussion of the WDR.      So, I&#13;
                                                                 Page135&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 am going to postpone any discussion of that till then.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
           The only thing I would underline which is part&#13;
&#13;
 of that process is the difficult question of understanding&#13;
&#13;
 the types of institutions and the types of processes that&#13;
&#13;
 genuinely represent the interests of poor people.          That is&#13;
&#13;
 something we are only beginning to work with.          It is what&#13;
&#13;
 the poor communities themselves are saying is a major&#13;
&#13;
 missing link, and that governments are failing them, even&#13;
&#13;
 when there are formal structures of voting.          But that is a&#13;
&#13;
 central challenge which we will again be discussing in the&#13;
&#13;
 future.&#13;
&#13;
           The final thing, we take note of the concerns of&#13;
&#13;
 the poverty notes and the need to link them with the CAS.&#13;
&#13;
 And, as I said before, we will get back to you to discuss&#13;
&#13;
 how to achieve the common end I think that we all mutually&#13;
&#13;
 understand and avoid the risks.&#13;
&#13;
           Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
           Good answers to good questions.          Now are there&#13;
&#13;
 any further comments?    Jan.&#13;
&#13;
           MS. PIERCY:   I risk the wrath of my colleagues&#13;
&#13;
 at this hour.   One point, going back to Masood Ahmed's&#13;
&#13;
 opening -- this is a point I make through the lens of the&#13;
                                                                      Page136&#13;

 Ad Hoc Committee on Board Policies and Procedures -- when&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                         507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                       Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                           (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 Masood made the point that if we endorse this framework,&#13;
&#13;
 then, of course, we have to see that it is consistently&#13;
&#13;
 applied across CASs and how countries are held to it.&#13;
&#13;
             The point I want to make is that the Board has a&#13;
&#13;
 role to play here.    Part of our role -- and that is part&#13;
&#13;
 of why it is important that we debate this and that we do&#13;
&#13;
 fully elaborate the points of agreement and the points of&#13;
&#13;
 difference -- because it should mean something if we in&#13;
&#13;
 the end endorse the framework, and that then should mean&#13;
&#13;
 that we consistently apply it across the CASs.      And we are&#13;
&#13;
 a part of how you begin to achieve that consistency.&#13;
&#13;
             And I want to say that management can hold the&#13;
&#13;
 Board accountable, just like the Board holds management&#13;
&#13;
 accounts.    This is part of what we had begun discussing in&#13;
&#13;
 this Ad Hoc Committee.     So, I think we shouldn't shy away&#13;
&#13;
 from envisioning the role of the Board when management has&#13;
&#13;
 its conversations going up to the Strategic Forum, where&#13;
&#13;
 this will be discussed, because I think that is really&#13;
&#13;
 critical.    And that also translates into how we orient in-&#13;
&#13;
 coming members of the Board, so they know there is a&#13;
&#13;
 framework, and it was adopted and this are its&#13;
&#13;
 implications, so that we over time become an active&#13;
                                                                  Page137&#13;

            Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
            MR. SANDSTROM:    Thank you, Jan.        You are right;&#13;
&#13;
 it is very helpful.     We all need to focus on this and be&#13;
&#13;
 disciplined and just work together and get it done.&#13;
&#13;
            And we need also to disseminate this to staff,&#13;
&#13;
 and that is the next challenge now also, to work with&#13;
&#13;
 them.   We have a number of teams who are actually doing&#13;
&#13;
 it, and they are cross-fertilizing within and across&#13;
&#13;
 regions.   But we need at the corporate level to do much&#13;
&#13;
 more.&#13;
&#13;
            Part of that is to develop an operational plan&#13;
&#13;
 to implement this.      So, that is the next challenge.&#13;
&#13;
            Are there any further comments, any further&#13;
&#13;
 statements?&#13;
&#13;
            [No response.]&#13;
&#13;
            MR. SANDSTROM:    You know what we need to do now.&#13;
&#13;
 This is the Board discussion in the Bank.           The Fund will&#13;
&#13;
 be discussing the same sets of issues on the HIPC link&#13;
&#13;
 paper on Monday.   So, as usual, what we would like to do&#13;
&#13;
 is to transmit the formal summary to the Fund Board of&#13;
&#13;
 this discussion.&#13;
&#13;
            So, if you have some more patience with us, I&#13;
                                                                      Page138&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 will read out the draft of a summary of this discussion,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MILLER REPORTING COMPANY, INC.&#13;
                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 which will try to highlight the major themes of what came&#13;
&#13;
 out.   I will do that and then, if you have any further&#13;
&#13;
 comments or changes, additions to this, if you could give&#13;
&#13;
 it to us now and then we will work on it, clean it up and&#13;
&#13;
 get it out quickly.    So, let me try this.&#13;
&#13;
             Directors strongly welcomed the thrust of both&#13;
&#13;
 documents and the effort they reflect to enhance the&#13;
&#13;
 impact of Bank and Fund activities and the role of&#13;
&#13;
 external assistance, more generally, including debt relief&#13;
&#13;
 in poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
             Directors endorsed the emphasis on outcome-based&#13;
&#13;
 indicators, the international development goals,&#13;
&#13;
 participatory process and country ownership of a poverty-&#13;
&#13;
 oriented development strategy.&#13;
&#13;
             Directors supported the joint proposal by Bank&#13;
&#13;
 and Fund staffs to move to tripartite poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategy papers as a basis for integrating policies and&#13;
&#13;
 programs.&#13;
&#13;
             On the paper, "Building Poverty Reduction&#13;
&#13;
 Strategies in Developing Countries", Directors welcomed&#13;
&#13;
 the comprehensive approach to poverty reduction.    They&#13;
&#13;
 stressed that sustained poverty reduction is not possible&#13;
                                                                Page139&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
 without economic growth.     Consequently, macroeconomic&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;
                            (202) 546-6666&#13;
&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 stability and structural reforms that allow sustained&#13;
&#13;
 growth are an essential part of any poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategy.&#13;
&#13;
             But to maximize the poverty-reducing impact of&#13;
&#13;
 growth requires a determined focus on the determinance of&#13;
&#13;
 poverty and related public action.         As poverty is multi-&#13;
&#13;
 dimensional, the poverty response would also need to be&#13;
&#13;
 multi-dimensional, relating not only to more spending in&#13;
&#13;
 social sectors but also to other reforms that improve the&#13;
&#13;
 access of the poor to the benefits of economic growth.&#13;
&#13;
             Directors emphasized the need to be pragmatic in&#13;
&#13;
 the application of this approach, taking into account the&#13;
&#13;
 circumstances of each country.       They also cautioned that&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction is a long-term process and we should&#13;
&#13;
 avoid creating unrealistic expectations which do not take&#13;
&#13;
 into account capacity constraints, including those related&#13;
&#13;
 to statistical information and poverty monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
             Directors agreed that broad-based participation&#13;
&#13;
 is needed at the design, implementation and monitoring&#13;
&#13;
 stages of a successful poverty reduction strategy.&#13;
&#13;
 Directors also supported the use of a clear set of&#13;
&#13;
 outcome-oriented goals and intermediate indicators to&#13;
                                                                   Page140&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 ensure that poverty reduction strategies are well-designed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;

                          507 C Street, N.E.&#13;
                        Washington, D.C. 20002&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 and provide a feedback mechanism to ensure that they are&#13;
&#13;
 implemented effectively.&#13;
&#13;
            The selection and monitoring of such indicators&#13;
&#13;
 would be a good vehicle for broad participation of civil&#13;
&#13;
 society.   Directors agreed that in the context of the HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 Initiative and given the irrevocable nature of debt&#13;
&#13;
 relief, transparency and accountability were important&#13;
&#13;
 features of any poverty reduction strategy and would help&#13;
&#13;
 ensure effective use of debt relief after the completion&#13;
&#13;
 point.&#13;
&#13;
            In this context, they suggested that governance&#13;
&#13;
 be given higher priority among the levers for public&#13;
&#13;
 action in the poverty reduction strategies.&#13;
&#13;
            Finally, Directors urged management to move&#13;
&#13;
 quickly to operationalize the approach and to ensure&#13;
&#13;
 effective implementation.&#13;
&#13;
            On the paper, "Strengthening the Link Between&#13;
&#13;
 Debt Relief and Poverty Reduction", Directors endorsed the&#13;
&#13;
 broad and open consultative process undertaken to solicit&#13;
&#13;
 the views of interested parties in the second stage of the&#13;
&#13;
 review of the HIPC Initiative.      They welcomed the wide&#13;
&#13;
 range of comments and proposals received from NGOs,&#13;
                                                               Page141&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 These extensive contributions, which have been conveyed in&#13;
&#13;
 full to the Executive Boards of the World Bank and IMF and&#13;
&#13;
 summarized in the HIPC link paper, provide valuable inputs&#13;
&#13;
 into strengthening the link between debt relief and&#13;
&#13;
 poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
           Directors fully endorsed the integration of HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 debt relief into comprehensive efforts to reduce poverty&#13;
&#13;
 and the introduction of the poverty reduction strategy&#13;
&#13;
 paper to this effect.    Directors noted that poverty funds&#13;
&#13;
 could provide a vehicle to foster the link between debt&#13;
&#13;
 relief and poverty reduction.      However, they stressed the&#13;
&#13;
 need to ensure that all resources, including amounts&#13;
&#13;
 released by debt relief and new inflows of external&#13;
&#13;
 assistance, were integrated in a transparent, well-managed&#13;
&#13;
 and accountable resource allocation process.&#13;
&#13;
           Directors noted that resources other than debt&#13;
&#13;
 relief would continue to provide the bulk of resources&#13;
&#13;
 available to finance spending on poverty reduction and&#13;
&#13;
 cautioned against poverty funds that were not integrated&#13;
&#13;
 into the wider budgetary process.&#13;
&#13;
           Directors agreed that the poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategy paper as a tripartite document of the&#13;
                                                                 Page142&#13;

&#13;
 authorities, the World Bank and the IMF could be a very&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 effective vehicle to ensure the poverty impact of Bank and&#13;
&#13;
 Fund assistance, to link debt relief and poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 and to ensure ownership, transparency and broad-based&#13;
&#13;
 participation.&#13;
&#13;
           They noted that moving to the PRSP would take&#13;
&#13;
 time and should be phased in, depending part on the pace&#13;
&#13;
 at which countries can build the relevant capacity.&#13;
&#13;
           Directors also supported the proposal that the&#13;
&#13;
 PRSP should be discussed by the Executive Boards of the&#13;
&#13;
 World Bank and the IMF.&#13;
&#13;
           Directors stressed the importance of the early&#13;
&#13;
 provision of debt relief under the enhanced HIPC&#13;
&#13;
 framework.   They agreed in principle that the poverty&#13;
&#13;
 reduction strategy should be in place when a country&#13;
&#13;
 reached its decision point under the HIPC Initiative, but&#13;
&#13;
 supported the need for flexibility so that the decision&#13;
&#13;
 point could take place while the poverty reduction&#13;
&#13;
 strategy is being formulated, provided the government is&#13;
&#13;
 committed to a firm timetable for the formulation and&#13;
&#13;
 implementation of the strategy which should be in place&#13;
&#13;
 well before the completion point.&#13;
&#13;
           Directors agreed that in HIPCs that have already&#13;
                                                              Page143&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 reached their decision or completion points under the&#13;

&amp;#12;[--- Unable To Translate Graphic ---]&#13;
&#13;
 current framework, the timing of the proposed additional&#13;
&#13;
 debt relief should be determined, inter alia, on an&#13;
&#13;
 assessment of their progress in the signing and&#13;
&#13;
 implementing their poverty reduction strategies.&#13;
&#13;
           And finally, Directors supported broad&#13;
&#13;
 dissemination of the two papers.&#13;
&#13;
           Is there anything you want to add, delete or&#13;
&#13;
 change?&#13;
&#13;
           [No response.]&#13;
&#13;
           MR. SANDSTROM:    If not, we will go through this&#13;
&#13;
 and clean it up and make sure that it is clear, not too&#13;
&#13;
 repetitive, and that we have really captured the main&#13;
&#13;
 points.   But I think this is a fair summary.&#13;
&#13;
           We have gone through the written statements as&#13;
&#13;
 well as listened carefully today.&#13;
&#13;
           So, thank you very much.       These have been four&#13;
&#13;
 good hours.   Thank you.   Thanks to the team also.&#13;
&#13;
           [Whereupon, at 5:35 p.m., the meeting was&#13;
