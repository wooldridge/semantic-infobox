The Little Data Book on Private Sector Development 2015 is based on World&#13;
Development Indicators 2015 and its accompanying online tables, with a focus&#13;
on the private sector in development. The Little Data Book on Private Sector&#13;
Development 2015 is the result of close collaboration between the staff of&#13;
the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Development Data Group of the Development Economics&#13;
Vice Presidency and the Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice. The&#13;
Development Data Group team included Liu Cui, Federico Escaler, Buyant&#13;
Erdene Khaltarkhuu, William Prince, and Jomo Tariku. The Trade and&#13;
Competitiveness team included Ramin Aliyev, Jenny Datoo, Nathalie David,&#13;
and Patricia Ellen Steele. The work was carried out under the management&#13;
of Haishan Fu, director of the Development Data Group, and Klaus Tilmes,&#13;
director of the Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice. Azita Amjadi&#13;
and Leila Rafei coordinated all stages of production. Barton Matheson&#13;
Willse &amp; Worthington typeset the book. Nora Ridolfi, Paola Scalabrin, and&#13;
Janice Tuten from World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Publishing and Knowledge Division oversaw&#13;
publication and dissemination of the book.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                          Preface&#13;
Reliable cross-country data on aspects of private sector development are&#13;
crucial in planning for economic recovery and growth. In targeting increased&#13;
exports and investment, many governments prioritize an improved climate for&#13;
business as a basis to attract capital, create jobs, and provide basic services.&#13;
&#13;
The availability of cross-country data on the business environment has rapidly&#13;
expanded in recent years, including data from the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Doing&#13;
Business project, Enterprise Surveys, and the Entrepreneurship Snapshots.&#13;
&#13;
The data sources presented in this book report on the scope and types of&#13;
regulations that enhanceâ&#128;&#148;and constrainâ&#128;&#148;business activity, and they pro-&#13;
vide information on how business owners assess their business environments.&#13;
The data have led to new research, enabled benchmarking, and informed&#13;
the reform process in many developing countries. Please visit the Business&#13;
Environment Snapshots (http://rru.worldbank.org/besnapshots/) for more&#13;
information.&#13;
&#13;
Included in this guide are indicators on the economic and social context, the&#13;
business environment, private sector investment, finance and banking, and&#13;
infrastructure. Though a pocket guide cannot include all relevant variables,&#13;
the included indicators provide users with a general understanding of the&#13;
private sector in each country. Indicators displayed in the tables are defined&#13;
in the glossary, which also lists data sources.&#13;
&#13;
We welcome your suggestions on how to improve future editions and make&#13;
them more useful.&#13;

Data are shown for economies with populations greater than 30,000 or for&#13;
smaller economies if they are members of the World Bank. The term country&#13;
(used interchangeably with economy) does not imply political independence&#13;
or official recognition by the World Bank but refers to any economy for which&#13;
the authorities report separate social or economic statistics.&#13;

For operational and analytical purposes the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s main criterion for&#13;
classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Every&#13;
economy in The Little Data Book on Private Sector Development is classified&#13;
as low income, middle income, or high income. Low- and middle-income&#13;
economies are sometimes referred to as developing economies. The use of&#13;
the term is convenient; it is not intended to imply that all economies in the&#13;
group are experiencing similar development or that other economies have&#13;
reached a preferred or final stage of development. Classification by income&#13;
does not necessarily reflect development status.&#13;
&#13;
Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $1,045 or lessÂ in&#13;
2013.&#13;
&#13;
Middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of more than&#13;
$1,045 but less than $12,746. Lower-middle-income and upper-middle&#13;
income economies are separated at a GNI per capita of $4,125.&#13;
&#13;
High-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $12,746 or more.&#13;

   Censuses Institute of Argentina. The IMF has, however, issued a decla-&#13;
   ration of censure and called on Argentina to adopt remedial measures&#13;
   to address the quality of the official GDP and CPI data. Alternative data&#13;
   sources have shown significantly lower real growth and higher inflation&#13;
   than the official data since 2008. In this context, the World Bank is&#13;

Ease of doing business index ranks economies from 1 to 189, with 1 being&#13;
the best. A high ranking means that a countryâ&#128;&#153;s regulatory environment is&#13;
conducive to business operation. The index ranks the simple average of a&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s percentile rankings on 11 topics covered in Doing Business 2015.&#13;
The ranking on each topic is the simple average of the percentile rankings on&#13;
its component indicators. Data listed for 2013 are for June 2014. (World Bank)&#13;

GDP growth is the annual percentage growth rate of gross domestic product&#13;
(GDP) at market prices based on constant local currency. Aggregates are&#13;
based on constant 2005 U.S. dollars. GDP is the sum of gross value added&#13;
by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus&#13;
any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated&#13;
without deducting for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and&#13;
degradation of natural resources. (World Bank and Organisation for Economic&#13;
Co-operation and Development)&#13;
&#13;
GNI per capita, World Bank Atlas method, is gross national income (GNI)&#13;
converted to U.S. dollars using the World Bank Atlas method, divided by the&#13;
midyear population. GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers&#13;
plus any product taxes minus any subsidies not included in the valuation&#13;
of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees&#13;
and property income) from abroad. GNI, calculated in national currency, is&#13;
usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons&#13;
across economies. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates,&#13;
the World Bank Atlas method is used; it averages the exchange rate for a&#13;
given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of&#13;
inflation between the country and the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom,&#13;
and the United States. (World Bank)&#13;

            The little data book on Private Sector
            Development 2015 is a reliable cross-country data on aspects
            of private sector development, crucial in planning for
            economic recovery and growth. In targeting increased exports
            and investment, many governments prioritize an improved
            climate for business as a basis to attract capital, create
            jobs, and provide basic services. The availability of
            cross-country data on the business environment has rapidly
            expanded in recent years, including data from the World Bank
            Group s Doing Business project, Enterprise Surveys, and the
            Entrepreneurship Snapshots. Included in this guide are
            indicators on the economic and social context, the
            investment climate, private sector investment, finance and
            banking, and infrastructure. Though a pocket guide cannot
            include all relevant variables, the included indicators
            provide users with a general understanding of the private
            sector in each country. Indicators displayed in the tables
            are defined in the glossary, which also lists data sources.
