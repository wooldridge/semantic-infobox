1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A. OVERVIEW OF THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
Supply and Demand&#13;
1.1   China has become the third largest producer of energy in the world.  The&#13;
country's primary commercial energy supply and consumption increased at around&#13;
4.4 percent per year from 1980 to 1994 to reach 1,169 and 1,175 million tons of standard&#13;
coal equivalent (tce), respectively.  Coal is the most important source of energy,&#13;
accounting for about 74.1 percent, and oil for 18 percent of the total production.&#13;
Hydroelectric power (6 percent), natural gas (1.9 percent), and small quantities of shale&#13;
oil and geothermal power make up the balance. The largest consumer of energy is the&#13;
industrial sector (75.4 percent), followed by households (9.7 percent), services&#13;
(8.6 percent), and agriculture (6.3 percent). Details of the primary energy outputs are&#13;
given in Annex 1.1, and total energy production and consumption in Annex 1.2.&#13;
Energy Resources&#13;
1.2   Coal. China has large coal deposits, with recoverable reserves of about 900&#13;
billion tons, of which 30 percent are proven. In 1994, the country produced 1.2 billion&#13;
tons of raw coal. By the year 2000, China aims to produce 1.4 billion tons of coal a year.&#13;
The best quality coals are found in North China, where Shanxi and Inner Mongolia each&#13;
have reserves of 200 billion tons. However, insufficient transport capacity makes it&#13;
extremely difficult to move sufficient coal to the large consuming centers in Central and&#13;
East China.&#13;
1.3   Hydroelectric Potential. China is rich in water resources and has a long tradition&#13;
of harnessing them for energy and other uses. The country's hydroelectric potential is&#13;
estimated at 1,900 TWh a year, but only about 9 percent of it has been developed. Most&#13;
of the potential is located in the Southwest (70 percent), about 1,500 km away from the&#13;
main demand centers. However, the long gestation period for hydroelectric projects and&#13;
the lack of capital have slowed the development and utilization of hydroelectric&#13;
resources.&#13;
1.4   Crude Oil. China's ultimately recoverable reserves of crude oil are estimated at&#13;
some 80 billion tons, of which approximately 20 percent are proven.  The 1994&#13;
production amounted to 147.65 million tons of crude oil and cumulative production&#13;
reached 2.3 billion tons. China's refining capacity is the sixth largest in the world.&#13;
However, with the sharply increasing consumption, the country will become net importer&#13;
in the near future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
1.5   Natural Gas. China's natural gas resources are estimated at 33 trillion m3, of&#13;
which 3 to 5 percent are proven. In 1994, China produced 16.97 billion m3 of natural gas.&#13;
About 58 percent of the current production is nonassociated gas, mostly from Sichuan&#13;
Province. The remaining gas production is associated with onshore crude oil production.&#13;
1.6   Biomass. Noncommercial biomass energy use currently amounts to about one&#13;
quarter of total energy consumption in China. Fuelwood and agricultural residues are the&#13;
chief biomass fuels, and they are consumed almost entirely by rural households. China is&#13;
promoting a variety of measures to achieve environmentally sustainable biomass supply&#13;
and consumption levels, including more efficient use of biomass, tree planting, and&#13;
substitution of other fuels for traditional biomass fuels.&#13;
1.7   Nuclear Energy. Known uranium reserves in China are sufficient to sustain&#13;
15,000 MW of nuclear power capacity for 30 years. China commissioned its first&#13;
commercial nuclear power plant (300 MW) in 1992, in Zhejiang Province. In 1993/94,&#13;
the Daya Bay nuclear power plant (2x900 MW) was also commissioned; 70 percent of its&#13;
output is intended for nearby Hong Kong. The construction of a few additional plants is&#13;
planned to start before the year 2000, primarily in regions which lack coal and&#13;
hydroelectric resources.&#13;
1.8   Other Energy Resources. Other energy resources play a small role in energy&#13;
supply and are used mostly in remote areas. Geothermal energy has been found in&#13;
locations throughout the country. Although wind and solar energy have promising&#13;
prospects, they are not expected to significantly affect the overall supply of energy in the&#13;
near future. Oil shale deposits are large, but little is exploited because of lack of viable&#13;
technology.&#13;
B. THE POWER SECTOR&#13;
Supply and Demand&#13;
1.9   China is the second largest producer of electricity in the world. By the end of&#13;
1994, China's total installed capacity reached about 200 GW, 74 percent of which is&#13;
thermal capacity and the rest hydropower (25 percent) and nuclear power (I percent)&#13;
(Annex 1.3). China has 5 regional and 8 separate provincial power networks, of which 7&#13;
have installed capacities of 10 GW or more. The five regional power grids (East China,&#13;
North China, Northeast China, Central China and Northwest China) coordinate the&#13;
systems of several provinces together. The total length of the high and medium voltage&#13;
transmission lines (i.e., from 500 kV down to 110 kV) lines amounted to 236,149 km and&#13;
the transformer capacity of substations down to the 110 kV level (owned and operated by&#13;
the power utilities) was about 179 GVA. Considering the power supply as a whole from&#13;
production to end-user supply, transmission and distribution losses amounted to about&#13;
16 percent of generation.&#13;
1.10  Total power generation in China increased by two and one-half times between&#13;
1980 and 1994, an average increase of 8.0 percent per year over 14 years. About&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
927.8 TWh were generated in 1994, with thermal power accounting for 80 percent. The&#13;
share of hydroelectric power has remained fairly stable over the last decade. Even though&#13;
the Government has maintained a strong commitment to hydropower development,&#13;
capital constraints and the distance of major resources from load centers inhibit more&#13;
rapid development.  Coal-fired power plants provide about 90percent of thermal&#13;
generation, with oil-fired generation accounting for most of the balance. The share of oil-&#13;
fired generation has declined sharply since the early 1980s, owing to a concerted&#13;
government policy to minimize petroleum use for power. The share of natural-gas based&#13;
generation is negligible and is expected to remain so barring unforeseen major natural gas&#13;
discoveries.&#13;
1.11  Industry continues to dominate electricity consumption in China, accounting for&#13;
75.4 percent of electricity use in 1994; agriculture accounted for 6.3 percent, residential&#13;
consumers for 9.7 percent, municipal and commercial consumers for 6.7 percent, and&#13;
transport and communications for 1.9 (Annex 1.4). Industrial demand has continued to&#13;
drive overall power demand; more than 70 percent of incremental electricity use between&#13;
1985 and 1994 was in the industrial sector. Although service is of uneven quality, rural&#13;
access to electricity is high; about 96 percent of the nation's villages and about 80 percent&#13;
of rural families now have access to electricity.&#13;
1.12  Despite the strong growth in electricity output, most areas of China continue to&#13;
suffer from severe power shortages. Since GDP grew by 9.3 percent per year during&#13;
1980-94, the elasticity of electricity consumption growth relative to GDP growth was&#13;
only 0.86-an exceptionally low elasticity for any country over a sustained period, and&#13;
particularly for an industrializing country such as China. Chinese officials estimate the&#13;
shortfall between peak power demand and supply at more than 10 percent. Daily load&#13;
curves are relatively flat, as industries have had to respond to power shortages during the&#13;
peak daytime periods through rescheduling of work shifts. The annual load factor in the&#13;
Henan power grid in 1994, for example, was 72 percent.&#13;
1.13  China's GDP is expected to grow by at least 8 to 9 percent per year during&#13;
1994-2000. This rapid economic growth will put tremendous pressure on China's electric&#13;
power industry to avoid yet worse shortages. The total investment in China in 1994 was&#13;
Y 208 billion, of which Y 85.9 billion (41 percent) was in the power sector. China's&#13;
electric power construction program for the 1990s will certainly be the world's largest.&#13;
Assuming that an aggressive conservation effort can enable an electricity demand/GDP&#13;
growth elasticity of 1.0 to be sustained, electricity demand could be expected to continue&#13;
to grow at average rates of 8 to 9 percent per year during 1994-2000. To keep pace with&#13;
this demand growth, China would need to add some 17-20 GW of capacity per year.&#13;
1.14  Although China's current power development program emphasizes addition of&#13;
200 to 600 MW units, over one half of China's thermal power capacity is still in units&#13;
below 200 MW. Only about 12 percent of the total installed capacity is in units of&#13;
300 MW or more, compared to 60 to 80 percent in industrialized countries. The average&#13;
gross conversion efficiency of thermal units over 6 MW has improved over the 1980s,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
reaching 32 percent in 1993. This efficiency level is not unreasonable given the low&#13;
average unit sizes in operation, but is substantially lower than the 36 to 37 percent typical&#13;
of systems with larger units.&#13;
Power Sector Institutions&#13;
1.15 In the period 1988-92, the Ministry of Energy (MOE) maintained primary&#13;
responsibility within the Central Government for policy, planning and regulation of the&#13;
power and related energy subsectors. In May 1993 MOE was restructured during a broad&#13;
government reorganization, and a Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP) was established,&#13;
along with a Ministry of Coal and the existing China National Petroleum Corporation.&#13;
Chart I shows the entities that are within MOEP oversight.  The State Planning&#13;
Commission (SPC), on behalf of the State Council, has the responsibility for review and&#13;
approval of the strategic plans, investment programs and general pricing policy of the&#13;
energy sector.&#13;
1.16  Until early 1993, the State Energy Investment Corporation (SEIC) channeled&#13;
Government funds to finance coal and electricity projects. SEIC was responsible for&#13;
onlending funds for projects of national importance and representing the Government in&#13;
jointly financed projects. However, in April 1994, SEIC (and five other specialized&#13;
investment companies under SPC) were merged into a new policy bank, the State&#13;
Development Bank of China (SDBC). The People's Construction Bank of China will&#13;
perform policy lending as an agency of SDBC, and commercial banking activities on its&#13;
own account. For provincial power companies, it appears that equity and loans/debt shall&#13;
be channeled through the regional groups, and equity stakes will be held by the State&#13;
Development Investment Corporation (SDIC).&#13;
C. POWER SECTOR REFORMS-PROGRESS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS&#13;
1.17  Reforms in China's power sector during the 1980s involved a series of&#13;
incremental adjustments, largely to mobilize additional investment capital to finance&#13;
rapid growth. Taken as a whole, these adjustments have resulted in a sector structure that&#13;
is largely unrecognizable from that in the early 1980s. In 1980, the power sector was&#13;
fully controlled, managed and funded by Central Government departments. By the early&#13;
1990s, the sector had become much more decentralized, less vertically integrated and&#13;
open to nonutility producers.&#13;
1.18  In conformance with broad national reforms towards a market economy begun in&#13;
mid-1992, the Government initiated, in the early 1990s, a program of power sector&#13;
reforms. The reforrm agenda includes: (a) institutional restructuring-commercialization&#13;
and corporatization of power companies, and associated sector restructuring; (b) overhaul&#13;
of the regulatory and legal framework for the sector, including the promulgation of a&#13;
National Electricity Law; (c) further diversification in financing for power development,&#13;
including private sector participation; and, (d) the rationalization of power tariffs. The&#13;
Chinese approach to reform encourages experimentation with different reform options&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
and institutional forms. This gradual approach permits the Chinese to examine the&#13;
relevance and applicability of specific reforms, and also fine-tune implementation for&#13;
their broader dissemination or replication in other parts of the country. Box 1.1 provides&#13;
a snapshot of some of these pilot experiments.&#13;
Box 1.1: POWER SECTOR REFORM EXPERIMENTS IN CHINA&#13;
Industry Structure:&#13;
- System operation with separation of transmission and distribution from generation is being conducted in&#13;
Hainan Province. Actions undertaken include:  creation of a single transmission and distribution&#13;
shareholding company and several generation companies, including a wholly foreign-owned one.&#13;
- The creation of independent generation companies which will have their equity traded internationally&#13;
through either a share-listing on the New York or Hong Kong Stock Exchange is being considered in&#13;
Shandong Province.&#13;
Regulation:&#13;
- Complete functional and institutional separation of sector regulation and government oversight from the&#13;
provincial power company/bureau has been completed in Hainan Province. A separate agency was&#13;
established on June 1, 1995 to regulate the sector. A more ambitious experiment is under consideration&#13;
for Fujian Province. The success of these experiments should speed up the less radical reforms initiated&#13;
in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Henan.&#13;
Foreign Investment Financing:&#13;
- Huaneng International Power Development Company (HIPDC) and Shandong Power Development&#13;
Company, both raised equity capital through American Depository Receipt issues in New York in 1994.&#13;
- Meizhou Wan Power Project is a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) project of 2x350 MW in Fujian&#13;
Province. The project, which is 100 percent foreign owned, is being sponsored by a Consortium of&#13;
several international companies. IFC is exploring options for participating in the project. The project&#13;
was approved by SPC in September 1993.&#13;
- Rizhao Power Project is a joint-venture project of 2x350 MW in Shandong Province. The project is&#13;
sponsored by two international and five domestic investors. The foreign debt of $350 million is being&#13;
raised from two foreign financial institutions on a nonrecourse project-financing basis.&#13;
- Laibin B Power Project of 2x350 MW coal-fired plant in Guangxi Autonomous Region is the first Build-&#13;
Own-Transfer (BOT) project approved by the Government for international competitive bidding. The&#13;
owner has already solicited applications for prequalification.&#13;
1.19   Institutional and Corporate Restructuring.  MOEP is charged with overall&#13;
sector coordination and policy guidance, and is no longer involved in enterprise&#13;
management. Regional power entities are charged with responsibilities for regional grid&#13;
coordination and dispatching. Provincial power companies have become the utilities in&#13;
charge of management and operation of the bulk of the nation's power system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6-&#13;
1.20 The operational scope of the provincial power companies varies substantially, but&#13;
none of them has a monopoly of power supply in their respective provinces. At the&#13;
distribution level, about one-third of the country's urban distribution companies and over&#13;
80 percent of the country's rural distribution utilities are separate economic entities. At&#13;
the generation level, semi-independent joint-investment plants and fully independent&#13;
power plants have been developed in many areas, selling power to the provincial power&#13;
companies.&#13;
1.21  Efforts are underway to restructure the provincial power entities to operate more&#13;
like commercial corporations. In parallel, the sector structure is being reformed to&#13;
facilitate transparent relationships between, and in some instances, complete separation of&#13;
distribution and generation operations from the transmission core.&#13;
1.22  Further restructuring of the the power sector is under consideration. The current&#13;
plans are for MOEP to be dissolved in early 1996 and its oversight and regulatory&#13;
functions divided between SPC, the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), the&#13;
China Electricity Council, and the soon to be created National Power Company (NPC).&#13;
NPC would: (a) be designated by the State Council as the authorized representative of&#13;
the State as owner of government-owned power assets and is further authorized to make&#13;
investments in the power sector on behalf of the state; (b) operate the national (i.e.&#13;
interregional) transmission network; and (c) function as a holding company with the five&#13;
regional power group companies and the provincial power companies as subsidiaries.&#13;
After transformation of MOEP, the existing regional power administrations and&#13;
provincial power bureaus will undergo similar restructuring.&#13;
1.23  Legal and Regulatory Reform.  China is in the process of developing a&#13;
comprehensive legal and regulatory framework for operations in the power industry. The&#13;
existing legal framework consists of a multitude of inconsistent regulations and rulings,&#13;
developed over many years. The Government recognizes the need for overhauling the&#13;
regulatory framework and establishing more transparent and commercially driven&#13;
relationships between the various entities now involved in the sector, including regional&#13;
and provincial grids, semiautonomous joint-investment power plants and independent&#13;
power producers.&#13;
1.24 The Central Government is preparing a new Electricity Law, which will provide&#13;
the umbrella principles for the legal and regulatory system for the sector, for possible&#13;
promulgation in 1995. The Central Government is also preparing a series of more&#13;
specific regulations, consistent with the principles of the proposed Law. The emerging&#13;
regulatory system for the sector will clearly define government regulatory functions at&#13;
central and provincial levels, and will facilitate the separation of government oversight&#13;
functions from power company management. The World Bank is assisting MOEP in&#13;
assessing the existing laws and regulations and evaluating options to develop a new&#13;
regulatory framework through an IDF-funded technical assistance grant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.25  An important and innovative experiment in regulatory reform is being conducted&#13;
in Hainan Province to make the transition to an unbundled sector structure with separate&#13;
regulation. Actions undertaken include: creation of a single transmission and distribution&#13;
shareholding company; several generating companies, including a wholly foreign owned&#13;
one; and establishment on June 1, 1995 of a separate agency to regulate the sector.&#13;
Lessons learned from this experiment will be taken into account in furthering the power&#13;
sector reform efforts in other provinces.  A more ambitious experiment is under&#13;
consideration for Fujian Province.&#13;
1.26  Diversification of Financing Sources. Following changes in power project&#13;
financing from Government grants to loans in the early 1980s, the Govermnent&#13;
encouraged the development of additional financing sources from provincial and local&#13;
governments, large consumers, and, in some cases, private foreign partners. Since the&#13;
mid-1980s, the Government has allowed power produced from power plants financed&#13;
through these nontraditional sources to be sold at prices which provide for full debt&#13;
servicing and reasonable profit. This is referred to as the "new plant, new price policy."&#13;
The share of Central Government financing in power sector investment has fallen&#13;
sharply, from 91 percent in 1980 to less than 30 percent in 1994. Empowered with rights&#13;
to impose surcharges to accumulate funds for investment in power construction,&#13;
provincial and local governments have become a key source of financing, providing&#13;
about almost half of the investment funding for the sector in 1994.&#13;
1.27 Newly formed corporations have also become important players. The Huaneng&#13;
International Power Development Corporation (HIPDC) was formed in 1985 with the aim&#13;
of attracting foreign capital and technology for power plants located mainly in coastal&#13;
areas. As an independent power producer, HIPDC operates its 15 plants (5,800 MW&#13;
total) under a build, own, and operate (BOO) framework. HIPDC had a mandate to raise&#13;
ftunds from the international financial market, and it has tapped bilateral and suppliers'&#13;
credits, and commercial bank loans. HIPDC was able to raise foreign equity capital&#13;
through an American Depository Receipt (ADR) issue in New York in 1994. The&#13;
Sunburst Energy Development Corporation (SEDC), with three large power projects&#13;
under implementation, and the recently established China Power Investment Corporation&#13;
(CPIC) are other windows for the Government's investment, and cofinancing with the&#13;
local governments and foreign sources in power projects. Build, own and transfer (BOT)&#13;
schemes have also been introduced in China, most notably the privately-financed Shajiao&#13;
B and Shajiao C thermal power plants in Guangdong Province; and the recently approved&#13;
projects Meizhou Wan in Fujian province, and Lai Bin, the first power project approved&#13;
for international competitive bidding, in Guangxi Autonomous Region.&#13;
1.28  Many other BOO and BOT schemes are in the negotiation stages, but progress is&#13;
slow because the Government has not yet developed a clear regulatory framework and&#13;
policies to encourage competition at entry. Rapid expansion of this form of foreign&#13;
investment may also require Government acceptance of higher rates of return to investors&#13;
and/or underwriting of certain risks, especially foreign exchange convertibility and other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
policy related risks. Competitive bidding for power projects would be the best means of&#13;
establishing the market rate of return to international investors.&#13;
1.29 Power Pricing. Electricity price reform in China has involved a series of&#13;
incremental changes over the last 10 years. In the mid-1980s, multiple-track pricing was&#13;
introduced for both producers and consumers, in line with the shift away from full&#13;
vertical integration in the industry. This strategy was successful in increasing overall&#13;
tariff levels but, by the end of the decade, the power pricing system had become too&#13;
complex and difficult to manage.   Recent reformns have therefore focused on&#13;
simplification and rationalization of the system.&#13;
1.30  At the producer level, the state catalog prices charged for power produced by&#13;
Central Government-financed plants were modified in 1993. Prices for the electricity&#13;
produced from all new power plants are now set by contract to cover financing and&#13;
operating costs, on a plant-by-plant basis, and rolled into the average power tariff. Cost&#13;
recovery through the tariff system for new investments is thus ensured. Prices also are&#13;
similarly determined for existing plants financed through loans. The electricity tariff&#13;
applied for plants built with grant financing before 1985 has been rationalized to now&#13;
include an improved mechanism to automatically adjust prices annually to reflect fuel and&#13;
transportation cost variations. It is expected that producer prices for old power plants will&#13;
be revised to provide a reasonable rate of return on revalued assets.&#13;
1.31   At the consumer level, the prices are in general an average of the state catalog&#13;
prices and the guidance prices (that reflect full costs of supply from sources not financed&#13;
through the Central Government) plus national and local fees and surcharges. While the&#13;
situation varies between regions, the nature of the existing pricing system is such that&#13;
average consumer prices (including fees and surcharges) approximate long-run levels in&#13;
areas with rapid load growth, such as the coastal provinces. For example, average&#13;
consumer prices in Zhejiang Province are estimated to be about 50 fen/kWh compared to&#13;
a long-run average incremental cost of 45 fenikWh. Prices in underdeveloped areas, such&#13;
as Sichuan and Henan, are still below long-run marginal cost (LRMC) levels, but will&#13;
gradually be rationalized with increasing supply from new plants.&#13;
1.32  While tariff levels are approaching satisfactory levels, the structure of consumer&#13;
prices, however, remains too complex, lacks transparency, and is inequitable. In most&#13;
areas, including Henan Province, unfair "old" administered rates and "new" guidance&#13;
rates continue to be applied to different consumers. Some consumers are protected from&#13;
high cost electricity supply charges and certain local surcharges because they still hold&#13;
"in-plan" quota allocations, but other new or small consumers must pay high prices well&#13;
above actual supply costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

D. ELECTRICITY CONSERVATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION&#13;
Electricity Conservation&#13;
1.33  China has over 10 years of experience in the active promotion of electricity&#13;
conservation, with a solid record of achievement. The strength of its program lies in the&#13;
well developed institutional framework. Electricity conservation is handled by the&#13;
network of "Three Electricity Offices," with offices at central, provincial, prefectural and&#13;
county levels throughout the country. These offices are under the leadership of local&#13;
Economic Commissions, and coordinate their work with provincial power companies.&#13;
They monitor electricity intensity and use patterns in all major enterprises, promote&#13;
adoption of conservation technologies and electricity management improvements, and&#13;
assist in organizing funding for efficiency programs supported by the Government.&#13;
1.34  Further improvements in the efficiency of electricity use are imperative if China is&#13;
to realize its economic growth goals in an environmentally sustainable way. Henan&#13;
Province where the proposed project is located is a pioneer in many aspects of electricity&#13;
conservation.  Efforts in place include:  (a) an electricity conservation fund which&#13;
provides governnent cofinancing for conservation investments in industrial and&#13;
commercial sites; and (b) a program to popularize the use of high-efficiency lamps.&#13;
Environmental Protection&#13;
1.35   Thermal power production currently accounts for about one quarter of China's&#13;
coal consumption, and this share is expected to increase gradually. Improvements in the&#13;
efficiency of coal use in this sector not only alleviate pressure on the coal production and&#13;
transportation system, but also have a major impact on particulate, sulfur and carbon&#13;
dioxide emissions.&#13;
1.36  The achievement of economies of scale in thermal power production, through&#13;
expanded development of large generating units, is a priority because of the recent rapid&#13;
growth of small coal-fired power plants, in unit sizes of 50 MW or less. While national&#13;
policy emphasizes the addition of 300 MW and 600 MW units, new projects have lagged&#13;
behind demand and local governments are continuing to invest in large numbers of new&#13;
small plants, largely due to difficulties in mobilizing the necessary investment resources.&#13;
Compared with a state-of-the-art plant, these plants consume over 60 percent more coal&#13;
per unit of electricity produced. This results in at least 60 percent higher sulfur dioxide&#13;
emissions (depending upon the coal used), and roughly 60 percent greater emissions of&#13;
carbon dioxide. Particulate emissions from the small plants are proportionally even&#13;
higher, due to use of inefficient particulate control technology. If a sufficient number of&#13;
large-scale projects cannot be brought on stream in a timely fashion to substitute smaller&#13;
inefficient units, there is little doubt that this problem will worsen.&#13;
1.37  In terrns of emission control. in large and medium-scale plants, China has made&#13;
substantial progress in particulate control, through deployment of high efficiency&#13;
electrostatic precipitators. As the country has large reserves of low sulfur coal, China is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
just beginning to employ sulfur dioxide control devices in areas where ambient air quality&#13;
standards require them. Top priority should be given to areas which must rely on local&#13;
high sulfur coal, such as in southwest China. In these regions, thermal power plants often&#13;
burn coal of over 4 percent sulfur content (e.g., 5 to 10 times the level typical through&#13;
most of north and east China), and development of sulfur dioxide control strategies and&#13;
corresponding investments are now urgent in these areas.  Several pilot flue gas&#13;
desulfurization (FGD) projects have been implemented in areas where the sulfur content&#13;
of coal is relatively high: Luohang in Sichuan Province, Japanese-assisted projects in&#13;
Shandong Province and Taiyuan in Shanxi Province.&#13;
1.38  Recently, the Chinese Government initiated serious efforts to curb air pollution&#13;
related to the burning of coal and particularly to reduce the power sector's contribution to&#13;
the problem. The Government announced in June 1994 that it will spend about $2 billion&#13;
over the next seven years on an environmental program aimed at keeping S02 emissions&#13;
at a level of 15 million metric tons a year, as part of a comprehensive program of acid&#13;
rain abatement.  The government also announced its intention to keep particulate&#13;
emissions at about 3.8 million tons (1992 level).&#13;
E. ROLE OF THE WORLD BANK&#13;
World Bank Power Sector Assistance Strategy&#13;
1.39 In line with Bankwide policies, the Bank's energy assistance program in China&#13;
places special emphasis on sector reform and energy conservation. During the last two&#13;
years, the Bank's technical assistance program for the power sector has focused on&#13;
helping the Chinese in assessing reform options (through a study funded by the Bank's&#13;
Institutional Development Fund), defining implementation strategies (through sector&#13;
work on power sector reform), and exploring options for mobilizing domestic and foreign&#13;
private funds to meet the capital needs of sector development (through informal sector&#13;
work). The study (Strategic Options in Power Sector Reform in China, 1993) and sector&#13;
report (China Power Sector Reform: Towards Competition and Improved Performance,&#13;
Report 12929-CHA, 1994) provide vehicles for dialogue between the Bank and Chinese&#13;
institutions. Technical assistance is also now being provided to help the central&#13;
authorities develop an improved legal and regulatory framework for the sector. The&#13;
energy conservation support program includes technical assistance through the Global&#13;
Environment Facility (GEF), lending support in selected industrial, environment and&#13;
energy projects, and development of a series of new GEF investment operations. The&#13;
power sector lending program now focuses on assistance for the detailed aspects of&#13;
implementation of the power sector reforms, primarily in the less-advanced inland&#13;
provinces, as well as reducing the power shortages that continue to hamper development&#13;
and slow the market orientation of the sector.&#13;
1.40  The Bank also supports the Chinese Government's serious efforts to: (a) curb air&#13;
pollution related to the burning of coal and particularly to reduce the power sector's&#13;
contribution to the problem; and (b) accelerate the development of hydropower and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
construction of large and efficient 300 and 600 MW coal-fired units to avoid the&#13;
mushrooming of the small and highly polluting plants that still constitute about 60&#13;
percent of the additional installed capacity.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.41   The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)&#13;
for China presented to the Board on June 1, 1995. For the power sector, the CAS&#13;
identified six focal points for Bank assistance: (a) commercialization and corporatization&#13;
of operating companies and enterprises; (b) development of adequate regulatory and legal&#13;
frameworks; (c) introduction of competition and transparency; (d) assurance of adequate&#13;
tariff policies; (e) development of new sources and methods of financing; and (f) transfer&#13;
of new technology and modern operational and environmental management techniques.&#13;
This ambitious reform program reflects the detailed strategy set out in the recent power&#13;
sector strategy for China.&#13;
1.42  The project supports this strategy by including implementation of a reform&#13;
program to: (a) incorporate the provincial company, Electric Power of Henan (EPH), as a&#13;
limited liability company; (b) separate government and corporate functions within the&#13;
Company; (c) improve its structural organization and managerial processes to increase&#13;
cost conscientiousness and business orientation; (d) promote competition at the&#13;
generation level; and (e) rationalize the pricing system within the province (see&#13;
Chapter 3).  It also supports electricity conservation and adequate environmental&#13;
protection and monitoring (in close cooperation with the Asian Development Bank).&#13;
Past Bank Involvement and Lessons Learned&#13;
1.43   Since the first project for the power sector in 1982, the Bank has helped to finance&#13;
17 large power generation and load management projects, seven thermal, eight hydro, and&#13;
two transmission projects (Annex 1.5). Technical assistance in project management,&#13;
system operations, finance, management and institutional reform has been included in the&#13;
projects. Through these operations, the Bank has helped to introduce: (a) state-of-art&#13;
technologies and control systems in generation, transmission, distribution and pollution&#13;
control; (b) modem operational practices and procedures to improve power system&#13;
reliability and control; (c) improved methods for project planning, design, construction&#13;
management, and environmental impact assessment; (d) improved financial planning and&#13;
utility management tools and practices; (e) techniques for computing and establishing&#13;
appropriate tariff structures and levels; and, (f) assistance in sector and regulatory reform.&#13;
1.44  These operations have yielded useful lessons on project preparation, technical and&#13;
operating aspects of power systems, and sequencing of institutional reform.  The&#13;
experience gained from these projects and broader international experience in power&#13;
sector restructuring have also been taken into account in developing the Bank power&#13;
sector strategy in China, and in designing the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
1.45  Lessons learned from the previous seven thermal power projects were considered&#13;
during preparation of the proposed project in order to (a) avoid commissioning delays&#13;
experienced in the past due to contractual interface problems and weak project&#13;
management, (b) improve the quality of environmental studies and monitoring measures,&#13;
and (c) ensure commitment of the beneficiary to the institutional and corporate reforms to&#13;
be included in the project. Specific actions have been taken to increase involvement of&#13;
foreign consultants in assisting the Beneficiary in assessing the environmental impacts of&#13;
the project and preparing the environmental management plan, and in preparing a&#13;
comprehensive reform  plan prior to the preappraisal mission.  The procurement&#13;
packaging was revised to avoid problems experienced during the construction of the&#13;
Yanshi project (Loan 3433-CHA) in coordinating the different suppliers and vendors-&#13;
especially those involved in implementation of the instrumentation and control module.&#13;
Finally, a serious boiler accident at Beilungang has been taken into account in boiler&#13;
design and specifications, coal specifications and "check coal" specifications, and&#13;
intensified coal monitoring. Complementary studies were prepared by the Beneficiary&#13;
and its consultants on coal sampling and analysis and the methods used were found to&#13;
conform with international standards by the Bank's mining specialists.&#13;
1.46  In power sector restructuring and reform implementation, international experience&#13;
shows that even in advanced countries with strong legal systems and open economies, the&#13;
time needed to build consensus on the reform directions, establish a new regulatory&#13;
framework, and implement structural changes can be very long. In Central and Eastern&#13;
Europe, hopes for achieving quick progress in economic regulation in the energy sector&#13;
have not materialized because of the weaknesses of legal systems and the lack of interest&#13;
of governments in attracting large-scale private investments to meet current and&#13;
prospective demands.' A comparative study on the progress in power sector reforms in&#13;
these countries concluded that pursuit of transparency and accountability of energy and&#13;
other utilities is the best way to achieve progress in economic regulation.2  In Asian&#13;
economies, the reform effort has met with mixed success. Efforts to encourage private&#13;
investments have been successful in Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand, but private-&#13;
sector initiatives are taking more time to implement than originally expected.&#13;
Restructuring of the power industry in both regions is cautious. The industry is still&#13;
mostly vertically integrated and gradually evolving toward the purchasing agency model.&#13;
Considering China's 40-year history of a command and control economy, the progress&#13;
achieved during the last decade and especially during the early 1990s, clearly indicates&#13;
the Government's commitment to reform. However, the difficult transition to market&#13;
oriented macroeconomic environment, without disruption, will take time and effort&#13;
because of the size of the system and the complexity of the issues involved.&#13;

2. THE HENAN POWER GRID&#13;
2.1    Henan province, where the proposed project is located, is the second-most populous&#13;
province in China (with 89.5 million in 1994) and is still one of the less developed. In&#13;
1994, its per capita gross domestic product (GDP) amounted to less than 70 percent of the&#13;
national average. The province is nevertheless experiencing remarkable growth-from&#13;
1980 to 1994 its GDP increased at an annual average of 10.4 percent, which is 1.2 percent&#13;
above the national average. In 1994, its industrial output increased by 8.8 percent, despite&#13;
acute power shortages. Power supply constraints in the area have been overcome by&#13;
improved power system performance, energy conservation and load management measures.&#13;
Adequate power supply and increased sector efficiency through further market orientation&#13;
are crucial for sustained growth in the province.&#13;
A. THE HENAN POWER SYSTEM&#13;
2.2   In 1994, the Henan Power Grid (HPG) had a total installed generating capacity of&#13;
8,473 MW, 7,928 MW coal-based and only 545 MW of hydropower (Annex 2.1). The&#13;
peak load was 7,900 MW and the total electricity supply (including energy exchanges)&#13;
was 5,405 GWh. Electricity consumption per capita was 560 kWh, about three quarters&#13;
of the national average. The provincial power sector is plagued by acute shortages: in&#13;
1994, load was shed about 84,000 times (more than 240 times a day) and demand during&#13;
peak time exceeded supply by about 700 MW, 9 percent of the peak demand, despite&#13;
severe measures to limit power use by industrial consumers.&#13;
2.3    Henan's generating facilities include 12 major thermal power plants, one&#13;
hydropower station, and a number of small captive and other plants. Major power&#13;
generating plants greater than 50 MW in installed capacity are listed in Annex 2.2. The&#13;
local and captive power plants total about 2,742 MW in installed capacity. Electricity&#13;
generated in the province in 1994 amounted to 48,486 GWh, about 71 percent of the total&#13;
of which was supplied by Electric Power of Hunan (EPH).&#13;
2.4   The transmission system in 1994 consisted of 323 km of 500 kV lines, 3,844 km&#13;
of 220 kV lines, and 7,868 km of 110 kV lines. EPH owns and operates almost all&#13;
500 kV, 220 kV, and part of the 110 kV lines. The system also includes transformer&#13;
substations, with a total capacity of 24,391 MVA (Annex2.3.&#13;
2.5   The growth of energy requirements in HPG between 1989 and 1994 is shown in&#13;
Annex 2.4 and summarized in Table 2.1. HPG's peak demand has increased more&#13;
rapidly than energy requirements, 10.6 percent on average compared to 8.8 percent.&#13;
indicating improved supply conditions. The system has a maximum daily load factor of&#13;
about 87 percent and an annual load factor of 72 percent. The peak load usually occurs in&#13;
August.&#13;

2.6  In 1994, electricity consumption of the HPG amounted to 50,016 GWh; of which&#13;
industry, 77.2 percent; agriculture, 8.3 percent; residential, commercial and other&#13;
municipal customers in the cities, 8.62 percent; and the transport/telecommunication&#13;
sector, 2.8 percent. Energy consumption by consumer categories for HPG in the period&#13;
1989-94 is shown in Annex 2A.&#13;
B. LOAD FORECAST&#13;
2.7   The load forecasting is based on the premise that the electricity conservation&#13;
efforts will be sustained to improve the 1.1 electricity-GNP elasticity factor that was&#13;
achieved during the last decade. Electricity conservation programs in Henan province&#13;
saved more than 11 TWh from 1980 to 1993, through technical renovation, adoption of&#13;
advanced technologies and promotion of efficient end-use equipment, especially Compact&#13;
Fluorescent Lamps.&#13;
2.8   Load forecasts for the years 1994 through 2004 have been developed as part of the&#13;
economic planning process carried out by EPH. The forecasts were obtained by applying&#13;
a combination of econometric methods to the total electricity demand; and analytical&#13;
methods to the major consumer categories' demand. In particular, industrial loads were&#13;
estimated on the basis of market surveys and projected industrial output growth and&#13;
electricity intensities for different categories of industry. Rural loads were estimated&#13;
based on past trends for drainage and irrigation, rural industries loads, and lighting.&#13;
Municipal loads were estimated based on market surveys of hotels, buildings, and&#13;
government projects. Specific demand management and energy conservation measures&#13;
have been fully incorporated in the load forecasts. Details of the energy forecasts for&#13;
HPG are given in Annex 2.5 and summarized in Table 2.2.&#13;

2.9   The peak demand for the system is projected to increase from 7,900 MW in 1994&#13;
to 12,610 MW in 2000, and 16,880 MW in 2004, an average annual growth of 7.9 percent&#13;
from 1994 to 2004. Electricity supply would increase from 50 TWh in 1994 to 82 TWh&#13;
in 2000 and 110 TWh in 2004, averaging an annual growth of 8.3 percent over the whole&#13;
period.&#13;
C. ROLE OF THE PROJECT IN HENAN PROVINCE&#13;
2.10  The proposed project would ease the power shortage in the province, and, as&#13;
described in the following chapter, will support major institutional and financial reform in&#13;
the sector with the aim of putting Henan's power sector on a commercial footing. The&#13;
proposed physical investments include: (a) a generation component to provide reliable&#13;
and economical electricity supply in Henan and the Central China region, an area which&#13;
is experiencing strong and sustained economic growth. It will help the region cope with a&#13;
rapidly growving industrial demand resulting from its opening to the outside world, and&#13;
will further improve living standards in one of the poorest provinces in China; (b) a&#13;
transmission component to accommodate the new generation, improve the quality and&#13;
reliability of supply, and reduce the supply-side losses; and (c) an electricity conservation&#13;
component to accelerate the implementation of electricity conservation measures by&#13;
supporting economically and financially viable projects and substituting market&#13;
incentives for administrative measures to sustain progress in achieving Henan's&#13;
conservation potential.&#13;
2.11  The project overall is expected to have positive environmental benefits compared&#13;
to available alternatives. The proposed Qinbei power plant (phase I) to be constructed&#13;
under the project will introduce the first two 600 MW units to efficiently meet base load;&#13;
the units are designed to meet strict atmospheric emission standards and to minimize&#13;
other environmental impacts. The new capacity addition will result in reduced use, and in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
some case retirement, of older, less efficient and more polluting plants. The net effect&#13;
will be a large increase in energy generation and a substantial improvement in overall&#13;
efficiency of the power system, without a substantial increase in air pollution.&#13;
2.12  Finally, and as described in Chapter 3, the project will significantly contribute to&#13;
the provincial power sector reform and to the commercialization and corporatization of&#13;
EPH, which will remain one of the major operators in the sector.&#13;
&#13;

3. THE BENEFICIARY&#13;
A. LEGAL STATUS AND ORGANIZATION OF EPH&#13;
3.1   The beneficiary of the proposed loan is the Electric Power of Henan (EPH), which&#13;
is one of three closely related provincial power sector entities. The others are the Henan&#13;
Province Electric Power Bureau (HPEPB) and Henan Province Construction Investment&#13;
Company (HPCIC). The functions of the three entities can be broadly defined as&#13;
commercial, regulatory and investment. All three entities have counterparts at prefecture/&#13;
municipal and county level-at the regional level, the equivalent bodies are the Central&#13;
China Electric Power Group Company (CCEPGC), Central China Electric Power&#13;
Administration (CCEPA), and Central China Electric Power Investment Company&#13;
(CCEPIC). A more detailed explanation of the power sector structure in Henan Province&#13;
is given in Annex 3. 1.&#13;
3.2   EPH is an independent legal entity possessing the status of a limited liability&#13;
company. Its charter has been formulated under the Law on Industrial Enterprises, and&#13;
the State Council's regulation on the "Structural Reformation of Central China Power&#13;
Network," prior to the promulgation of the new Company Law. EPH's legal status and&#13;
Charter require revision to conform with the new Company Law, promulgated in&#13;
December 1994. EPH is an affiliate of CCEPGC. CCEPGC is responsible for&#13;
coordination, development and operation of the Central China power system comprising&#13;
power companies in Henan, Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces.&#13;
3.3   The functions of EPH are outlined in its existing charter.  These include&#13;
construction of power projects and raising of funds from various sources. In practice,&#13;
EPH obtains investment funds from state, provincial and local governments and through&#13;
borrowing from local banks and financial institutions. EPH also has the corporate power&#13;
to issue bonds and shares with the approval of relevant authorities. It has the authority to&#13;
receive the proceeds of the proposed World Bank loan through the Central Government,&#13;
to carry out the proposed project, and to enter into a Project Agreement with the World&#13;
Bank.&#13;
B. OTHER PROVINCIAL ENTITIES&#13;
3.4   EPH was formed from HPEPB, which until 1988 was entrusted by central and&#13;
provincial governments with overall responsibility for provision of safe, reliable&#13;
electricity supply throughout the province.  Its responsibilities included planning,&#13;
construction, operation and marketing at the provincial level, as well as administration&#13;
and regulation of enterprises at the county and municipal level. In 1988, the State&#13;
Council approved the "Scheme of Power Industry Managerial System Reform," which&#13;
provided for setting up provincial power companies to take over commercial functions of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
the power bureaus. EPH thus became responsible for construction, operation and&#13;
marketing, while HPEPB retained the administrative and regulatory functions. In&#13;
practice this separation of functions has still not occurred and the sector is still&#13;
administered under the policy known as "one entity-two nameplates." Currently, the&#13;
general manager of EPH is also head of the HPEPB. This requires him and other staff of&#13;
EPH to exercise several regulatory functions in addition to core management and&#13;
operational functions. As part of the ongoing power sector reform program in China, the&#13;
Government is planning to separate the regulatory functions of the Bureau from the&#13;
Corporation.&#13;
3.5   HPCIC is a provincial government-owned enterprise entrusted with management&#13;
of provincial investments in power facilities. It raises funds from external sources for&#13;
financing components of EPH's power development program. The most important&#13;
source of funds administered by HPCIC is the 2 fen/kWh surcharge collected from&#13;
consumers. HPCIC expects to receive a return/dividend on its investments and interest&#13;
on its loans. For new power generation, funds are usually pooled with those from other&#13;
state, municipal or county-level investors to finance "joint investment" projects,&#13;
constructed, managed and operated by EPH.&#13;
C. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
3.6   EPH's Charter provides for a Board of Directors to manage the company, but to&#13;
date the Board has not been established. Accordingly, the overall management of EPH is&#13;
entrusted to a general manager/director (assisted by four deputy directors) appointed by&#13;
MOEP in consultation and agreement with the Provincial Government and CCEPA. The&#13;
general manager is the legal representative of the company and responsible for its&#13;
operations. The exercise of his powers (e.g., hiring and firing of staff and labor) is,&#13;
however, subject to "relevant state rules and regulations."&#13;
3.7   EPH has 49 functional divisions and offices, including 12 power plants, 13&#13;
prefecture/municipal power supply enterprises, two construction companies, separate&#13;
companies for material and fuel supply and seven training institutions. The organization&#13;
structure is detailed in Chart 2.&#13;
3.8   EPH has traditionally had a technically strong and effective management. Current&#13;
performance indicators for EPH reveal high plant capacity factors (with thermal capacity&#13;
factors reaching as high as 82 percent in periods of severely constrained supply), with&#13;
transmission and distribution losses generally less than 6 percent (Annex3.2). EPH&#13;
prepares accounting information in a timely fashion and operates an effective billing and&#13;
collection system. However, the company is now in a dynamic growth stage. Over the&#13;
period 1990-94, EPH revenues trebled from Y 2.6 billion to Y 7.5 billion, and over the&#13;
period to 2004, they are projected to increase more than sevenfold to Y 51.8 billion. This&#13;
dramatic growth requires EPH's transformation to a fully corporatized self-sufficient&#13;
entity and considerable upgrading of its institutional and, most important, financial&#13;
capabilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
3.9   As part of the preparatory work for this project, EPH carried out a study to define&#13;
measures needed to reorganize its operations and further strengthen its management.&#13;
EPH appointed a task force to carry out this study assisted by international consultants,&#13;
financed by the Bank.  The reform  action plan and proposed improvement of&#13;
management information systems included in this project are based on the&#13;
recommendations of the study.&#13;
D. REFORM IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
3.10  A key objective of the proposed project is to assist and facilitate the corporate&#13;
restructuring of EPH and its affiliated enterprises, promote a more open sector structure,&#13;
and initiate competition at the generation level. In consultation with the Bank, EPH has&#13;
prepared and agreed to implement a package of sector and enterprise-related reforms&#13;
(Annex 3.3), consisting of appropriately sequenced and time-bound actions. The main&#13;
elements of the implementation plan are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Incorporation of EPH as a Limited Liability Company. EPH will&#13;
revise its charter to delineate its rights and obligations and develop an&#13;
adequate corporate governance framework in accordance with the new&#13;
Company Law. EPH will then be incorporated as a limited liability&#13;
company (under the new Company Law) within nine months of issuance&#13;
of necessary State Council regulations on restructuring state-owned&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
(b)   Separation of Government and Enterprise Functions. An important&#13;
objective of power sector reform at the provincial level is to separate&#13;
government ownership and regulatory functions from enterprise operation&#13;
and management functions. EPH, MOEP and CCEPA agreed to achieve&#13;
this objective in a two step approach: (i) consolidation of government and&#13;
regulatory functions (i.e., bureau functions) within one division within&#13;
EPH no later than June 1996; and (ii) separation of all bureau functions to&#13;
appropriate national and provincial level authorities in conformance with&#13;
the regulatory framework established at the national and provincial levels.&#13;
This separation will be achieved within 9 months of issuance of&#13;
implementing regulations.&#13;
(c)   Commercialization of Operations. EPH has agreed to streamline its&#13;
organizational structure and focus on its core businesses by converting&#13;
profit oriented units into autonomous companies or profit centers and&#13;
nonprofit oriented ones (social services) into cost centers to be shifted to&#13;
suitable institutions, pari pasu with the progress of social sector reforms.&#13;
It was agreed that technical assistance will be provided to EPH under this&#13;
project to develop and implement an organizational structure and&#13;
management system consistent with the above objectives and aiming at&#13;
improving the operational and managerial efficiency of the Company.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
(d)   Tariff Reform. EPH is finalizing a tariff reform action plan to achieve&#13;
the following: (i) tariff increases beginning in 1996 to meet agreed upon&#13;
financial targets and economically adequate tariffs by 2000; (ii) unification&#13;
of tariffs by end-1998; and (iii) adjustment of demand charges for&#13;
industrial customers, and price differentials between different voltage&#13;
levels to gradually reflect the cost of supply.&#13;
(e)    Power Sector Restructuring. EPH will, in coordination and consultation&#13;
with higher authorities, implement structural reforms to introduce&#13;
competition at the generation level, improve contractual arrangements&#13;
arnongst the different operating entities in the sector, and increase&#13;
efficiency at the distribution level. To achieve these objectives, EPH&#13;
agreed to: (i) establish a competitive solicitation program for additional&#13;
supply and procure, on this basis, at least one generation plant by the end&#13;
of 1998; (ii) incorporate its generation units (seven state owned power&#13;
plants) and its development power company into limited liability&#13;
companies by mid-1996; (iii) establish its 13 supply bureaus as profit&#13;
centers with transfer prices based on EPH's bulk sale prices by mid-1997;&#13;
(iv) develop model commercial contracts by mid-1 996; and (v) introduce&#13;
formal commercial contractual arrangements with other sector entities,&#13;
such as independent distribution bureaus, IPPs, fuel supply companies, etc.&#13;
3.11  In general, the timing of the various steps is more ambitious in areas which EPH&#13;
generally considers to be within its control, and more cautious in areas where legislative&#13;
action, or issue of regulations is required, even though such actions are anticipated.&#13;
3.12  In the area of regulation, the Electricity Law, which was approved in December&#13;
1995, identifies the basic principles for regulation of the electricity supply industry.&#13;
However, international experience clearly shows that development and/or changes in&#13;
regulatory frameworks are complicated and slow processes, especially for a country like&#13;
China where major macroeconomic reforms and decentralization of decision making are&#13;
being carried out at the same time. Assistance is being provided to the Central&#13;
Government in carrying out this major effort in the most efficient and comprehensive&#13;
way (see para. 1.39).&#13;
3.13   The pricing policy requires profound changes both at the wholesale and final&#13;
consumer levels. At the wholesale level, electricity generated from all "new" plants is&#13;
being priced, on a plant-by-plant basis, at "debt repayment price" levels, allowing for&#13;
payment of full debt service costs based on a 10-year repayment period after&#13;
commissioning of new power plants, while electricity generated from "old" power plants&#13;
(built before 1986) is being sold at prices fixed by the central government. This principle&#13;
has been effective in promoting alternative financing sources to substitute decreasing&#13;
budget allocations during recent years but it is not considered to be sustainable in the long&#13;
term. With the expected coming on line of large numbers of new plants, the 10-year&#13;
repayment principle would impose an unreasonable burden on EPH's finances over the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21 -&#13;
next few years but would lead to a much higher level of profits after the tenth year. It is&#13;
unreasonable to expect consumers to repay, over such a short period, loans which are&#13;
financing fixed assets which have a life of 2 to 3 times this period. At the consumer&#13;
level, prices depend on the source (old or new power plants) of the power they&#13;
purportedly are using. This means that customers in the same service area and with the&#13;
same consumption characteristics pay different prices. The multitier pricing might have&#13;
been useful for phasing in higher electricity prices to consumers, but it has become a&#13;
major impediment for progress towards economic pricing and results in distorted&#13;
consumption behavior. Unification of consumer tariffs is a priority.&#13;
3.14  In the corporatization area, the most urgent requirement is for the determination of&#13;
the respective ownership rights of the State and Provincial Governments in the fixed&#13;
assets of EPH and its affiliated enterprises. While China operated under a centrally&#13;
planned economy, all fixed assets belonged to the State and enterprises were entrusted&#13;
with the responsibility for their maintenance and use. There was no concept of ownership&#13;
in the legal sense. All fixed assets were financed up to 1985 from budget allocations but&#13;
since then, China has progressively moved towards loan financing, and since 1988 other&#13;
investors (provincial and local governments and HIPDC) have been investing in EPH&#13;
assets. In order to track the interests of the respective owners, and since ownership of&#13;
"state" assets had not been determined, separate records have had to be maintained for&#13;
various classes of assets and owners. Resolution of the ownership interests in EPH and&#13;
affiliated enterprises is dependent on the issuance of State Council implementing&#13;
guidelines for the restructuring of state-owned enterprises. Issuance of these guidelines&#13;
has been delayed because of conflicting interests of the numerous parties involved in&#13;
power sector development.&#13;
3.15  The project includes a comprehensive technical assistance component to assist&#13;
EPH with all aspects of its reform efforts: (a) an institutional strengthening component&#13;
directed at organizational restructuring and modernization of its financial management&#13;
and administrative practices (AnnexJ.4); (b) a comprehensive package of legal services&#13;
to assist in corporatization, and preparation of the necessary contractual documents for&#13;
sector restructuring (AnnxJ3.5); and (c) assistance in developing an appropriate tariff&#13;
structure and transition plan to achieve the agreed financial targets (Annex3.). Training&#13;
is included in all of the above technical assistance packages. Assurances were obtained&#13;
from EPH during negotiations that it would engage by June 1996 consultants to assist in&#13;
the review of its organization and management system, furnish the results and&#13;
recommendations of such reviews to the Bank by March 1, 1998, and thereafter&#13;
implement the recommended organizational improvements and accounting andfinancial&#13;
management systems, taking into account Bank comments.&#13;
3.16  EPH has established a working group comprising senior officials of the company&#13;
to manage the reform process, and its implementation is well underway. The program is&#13;
being supported by MOEP, CCEPAB and the Henan Provincial Government. Assurances&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
were obtained from EPH during negotiations that it would carry out the Reform&#13;
Implementation Plan according to the timetable agreed with the Bank (Annex3.).&#13;
E. STAFFING AND TRAINING&#13;
3.17 As of December 31, 1994, the company had a total staff of 53,384, of which about&#13;
21.8 percent were engineers and technicians, 6.7 percent administrative staff and&#13;
71.5 percent workers, including skilled and unskilled, apprentices and others. Except for&#13;
the core group of key technical and managerial personnel who are assigned by the State,&#13;
almost all of EPH's employees are recruited locally. Most of the employees are hired&#13;
under contracts based on their skills and training. Details of EPH's staffing are shown in&#13;
Annex 3.7.&#13;
3.18  EPH runs technical schools at Zhengzhou and Nanyang for skilled workers, a&#13;
management school for economists and two universities at Zhengzhou. There were 985&#13;
teaching and administrative staff in these training and educational centers, which had a&#13;
total enrollment of 4,848 students in 1994 (details in Anne.8A). This training capacity&#13;
is basically sufficient to meet EPH's long-term needs. However, the skills of teaching&#13;
staff and quality of teaching facilities are being improved and modernized. Training is&#13;
being designed to improve professional skills of staff engaged in planning, financial,&#13;
personnel, project construction and operational management areas. The proposed project&#13;
would support the EPH training program over a four-year period, financing foreign costs&#13;
of instructors, study tours and upgrading and equipping training facilities.&#13;
F. PLANNING, BUDGETING AND CONTROL&#13;
3.19 Power bureaus and companies are responsible for developing annual and five-year&#13;
production and investment plans which are integrated into the national plans and are&#13;
approved, through MOEP's auspices, by SPC. In the past, financial planning was&#13;
confined to attaching monetary values, predetermined by MOEP, to the power production&#13;
being planned. Although a power bureau's plan might be revised to reflect changes, it&#13;
would ordinarily not be revised to reflect differences between estimated prices and actual&#13;
prices. However, with the economic changes in the 1980s, prices have begun to move&#13;
toward market levels and the Government now finances investments through loans rather&#13;
than grants. Centralized control is being relaxed and replaced by greater financial&#13;
autonomy and responsibilities for the power entities. To address these changes, EPH will&#13;
need to adjust its planning system to include modem financial planning.&#13;
3.20 MOEP recognizes the importance of financial management in the power sector in&#13;
China and is promoting relevant training programs for all the power institutions under its&#13;
control. Many of the power bureaus/companies, including EPH, have been equipped with&#13;
personal computers and software for planning, budgeting, and accounting functions.&#13;
Information from the bureaus/companies can be transferred to MOEP and consolidated&#13;
into regional and national data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
3.21  These systems represent a good first generation of automated management&#13;
information; however, they still are not sufficient and integrated as a network to promptly&#13;
provide financial and related statistical information about a power entity's operations to&#13;
the various management levels, supplying each level with the necessary details at the&#13;
appropriate times. With EPH's rapid growth and commercialization, it is also necessary&#13;
for it to introduce an accounting and financial management system that will: (a) enable&#13;
managers to be held accountable for costs of activities and functions over which they&#13;
have control; (b) provide information for comparative analysis of actual costs with&#13;
budgets for decision making; and (c) provide transparency of information for investors,&#13;
government, lenders, and the public in general. The proposed project would include a&#13;
technical assistance component to support EPH in establishing a new organizational&#13;
structure and appropriate systems and procedures to upgrade its budgeting and financial&#13;
accounting systems, including provision of software and hardware, as well as&#13;
enhancement of its staff skills. The terms of reference for the proposed study under this&#13;
project is presented in Annex 3.4.&#13;
G. ACCOUNTING&#13;
3.22  EPH followed until recently a uniform enterprise accounting system and detailed&#13;
regulations established by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) which were developed in the&#13;
context of a highly centralized, planned economy. Recently, as part of China's efforts to&#13;
speed the transition to a market-oriented economy and improve the financial management&#13;
of enterprises, new regulations covering accounting rules and financial affairs were&#13;
introduced by MOF on July 1, 1993. These revised accounting principles are generally&#13;
consistent with those of international accounting standards.  Within this broad&#13;
framework, specific accounting standards will be developed with the assistance of the&#13;
Bank Group for all Chinese enterprises under the Financial Sector Technical Assistance&#13;
Project (Credit 2423-CHA).&#13;
3.23  While EPH has made good progress in implementing the new system, there are&#13;
still some areas where its accounting practices are not in accordance with international&#13;
practice. For example, EPH did not include the construction work in progress in the&#13;
accounts for 1994's financial statements due to the absence of specific accounting&#13;
standards and regulations which remain to be issued by MOF. Agreement to help make&#13;
further changes to regularize EPH's accounting and financial practices is therefore&#13;
included in the technical assistance component (para. 3.15).&#13;
H. Audit&#13;
External Audit&#13;
3.24  The State Audit Administration (SAA) was established in 1983 and given the&#13;
status of a ministry reporting directly to the State Council. In addition, provincial audit&#13;
bureaus have been established in each province and large municipality. The audit&#13;
regulations and standards prepared by MOF are based on international auditing practices&#13;
and were promulgated by the State Council on October 21, 1988. Audits of Bank-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
financed projects have been conducted by SAA's Foreign Investment Audit Bureau or&#13;
one of the Provincial Audit Bureaus (PAB) under its guidance. SAA and PABs have&#13;
been receiving training through an IDA-financed Technical Assistance Credit.&#13;
3.25  Under the proposed project, EPH's accounts will continued to be audited by&#13;
Henan Provincial Audit Bureau (to be confirmed during negotiations) under the&#13;
supervision of SAA. This arrangement is satisfactory. Assurances were obtainedfrom&#13;
EPH that it would: (a) maintain and provide to the Bank semiannual progress reports&#13;
with unaudited project accounts to reflect project expenditures for the period under&#13;
report compared with the original project cost estimate; (b) furnish the Bank with the&#13;
audited accounts for the project, statements of expenditures, and financial statements of&#13;
EPH within six months of the end of each fiscal year; (c) implement any changes to its&#13;
accounting practices as recommended by its financial management consultants to meet&#13;
international accounting standards; and (d) require its auditors to comply with&#13;
international auditing practices and provide audit plans prior to each audit. For the&#13;
FY95 audited financial statements, the auditors will provide: (a) their audit plan; (b) a&#13;
summary of the effects of accounting changes arising from the adoption of new MOF&#13;
regulations and corrections of any deviations from MOF regulations as interpreted with&#13;
reference to international accounting standards and practices; and (c) a management&#13;
letter summarizing any significant matters that may have arisen during the conduct of the&#13;
audit.&#13;
Internal Audit&#13;
3.26  EPH established an internal auditing section (staffed with qualified accountants)&#13;
in 1986, which periodically examines the accounts of each operating unit. The objective&#13;
of these examinations is primarily to test for accuracy and compliance with MOF&#13;
regulations. The section will serve as liaison between external auditors and the project&#13;
entity.&#13;
I. TARIFFS&#13;
3.27  Power pricing in Henan Province, as in other parts of China, underwent major&#13;
evolution during recent years. The current situation is detailed in Annex 3.9, and is&#13;
summarized here. As the economy moved to free markets, a multitier pricing system was&#13;
adopted. Power produced by plants financed by central government budget allocations&#13;
(prior to about 1985), and allocated through the old "in-plan quota" system, is sold at&#13;
catalog prices (first tier) which are established by MOEP and approved by SPC. These&#13;
are adjusted periodically to reflect increases in the costs of fuel and fuel transportation,&#13;
and, more recently, debt service costs. Electricity sold from power plants financed by&#13;
joint investments from State, Provincial and Local Governments is sold at "out of plan"&#13;
prices, referred to as the "guidance" price (second tier) based on full cost recovery&#13;
including debt repayment over 10 years and providing a reasonable return on investment.&#13;
In some provinces, power taken by consumers in excess of the quotas is priced about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
50 percent higher than the state catalog price (third tier). The guidance prices are&#13;
established by the provincial utilities and approved by the provincial power bureaus.&#13;
3.28  The state catalog prices, which used to be artificially low at about 6.5 fen/kWh&#13;
until 1985, have been gradually increased to an average of 16.5 to 18 fen/kWh for&#13;
agriculture, 22 fen/kWh for residential consumers, 22 to 23 fen/kWh for commercial&#13;
users and small industries, and finally 16.5 to 18 fen/kWh for medium and large&#13;
industries.&#13;
3.29  The guidance price is established annually based on the supply cost of out of plan&#13;
power. Out of plan power is provided by power plants financed by provincial and local&#13;
governments, independent power producers, and state plants above and beyond their&#13;
planned production. In Henan, the collective fund price averaged, in 1994, 25.2 fenlkWh.&#13;
This is expected to increase to about 29.7 fen/kWh by the end of 1995.&#13;
3.30  A variety of additional fees are added to the prices charged to consumers. With&#13;
the exception of a new 0.45 fen/kWh levy on all consumers throughout the country to&#13;
help finance the Three Gorges Hydroelectric project, these charges are levied by&#13;
provincial and local governments. In Henan Province, power sales to commercial and&#13;
industrial users are subject to a 2 fen/kWh surcharge for a Provincial Power Construction&#13;
Fund. Some other fees are earmarked to cover a part of local distribution costs or street&#13;
lighting. However, average prices to final consumers remain lower than the long-run&#13;
marginal cost (LRMC).&#13;
3.31  The operation of the above multitier pricing system has proved to be useful for&#13;
phasing in higher prices to consumers and in creating a situation through which&#13;
investment decisions can be based on market prices. Now, since the difference between&#13;
the state catalog and the guidance prices has narrowed, EPH intends to begin the&#13;
unification of its pricing system in 1996, and complete it by offering uniform tariffs to all&#13;
customers of similar categories in 1998. This would be a major step in rationalizing the&#13;
pricing system in Henan. A task force to plan this process, comprising officials of EPH&#13;
and the Provincial Pricing Bureau, has discussed its tariff reform plan with the Beijing&#13;
Economic Research Institute (BERI), SPC and MOEP. At negotiations, the Bank agreed&#13;
with EPH and the Government on an action plan and timetable for unifying EPH's tariffs&#13;
and establishing a suitable formula for adjusting the level of rates which would enable it&#13;
to meet the financial performance targets to be agreed under the proposed loan (para.&#13;
5.12.). This would require an increase of about 4.0 percent in real terms over the period&#13;
1995 to 2004 (para. 5.16). Rate structure improvements were also made in 1994 by&#13;
introducing time-of-the-day tariffs for bulk and large retail consumers. Peak rates are&#13;
twice off-peak rates for bulk supply customers and three times off-peak rates for retail&#13;
consumers, which limits administrative interference and introduces economic incentives&#13;
for load management, at the demand side.&#13;
&#13;

J. BILLING AND COLLECTIONS&#13;
3.32 As of December 31, 1994, electricity consumption in Henan Province, distributed&#13;
according to the consumer categories, is shown in Table 3.1. Details of the sales and&#13;
average price by category of consumers are given in Annex 3.9.&#13;
Table 3.1: ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION IN HENAN PROVINCE (1994)&#13;

3.33  EPH conducts its billing and collection activities through 13 power supply units.&#13;
All major industrial consumers receiving supply over 320 kVA are charged in advance&#13;
three times per month at approximate 10-day intervals. The last two bills, rendered on&#13;
about the sixteenth and twenty-fifth days of the month, are based on estimated usage&#13;
derived from the consumer's contractual power consumption. The first bill, rendered on&#13;
about the sixth day of the month, is also based on estimated usage but includes an&#13;
adjustment to reflect the previous month's actual usage as computed from a meter&#13;
reading. All other customers are billed once a month based on actual usage.&#13;
3.34  Industrial commercial and bulk consumers pay their bills through direct debit&#13;
from their bank accounts. Urban residential and low voltage agricultural consumers&#13;
receiving power directly from EPH render payments to local branches of the National&#13;
Bank. Payment is due within five days of receipt of the bill. Regulations stipulate that&#13;
consumers who do not pay within this period are to be charged a fine of 0.03 percent per&#13;
day of delay on the unpaid bill, and that after several notices those who still refuse to pay&#13;
their bills are disconnected. These billing and collection arrangements have established a&#13;
reliable cash flow from sales.&#13;

4. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.1   The main objectives of the project are to: (a) reduce the acute power shortages&#13;
and foster integrated development of the power system of Henan Province in the most&#13;
cost-effective and environmentally sound manner; (b) support adequate implementation&#13;
of power sector and power enterprise reforms and accelerate the transition of the Electric&#13;
Power of Henan to a legally and financially autonomous and business-oriented company,&#13;
in line with the recently enacted Company Law; (c) assist in transferring new power&#13;
technologies and in applying modem power operation/maintenance methods; (d) support&#13;
improvements in the efficiency of electricity use; and (e) contribute to rationalization of&#13;
power tariffs. During project preparation, the Beneficiary demonstrated full commitment&#13;
to these objectives and assisted in identifying performance indicators and critical success&#13;
factors to ensure the effective monitoring of project implementation and achievement of&#13;
the agreed objectives, and for recognition of potential problems during supervision (cf.&#13;
Section I of the present chapter).&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.2   The project team worked in close coordination with the Asian Development Bank&#13;
(ADB), which is also financing a thermal power project in Henan, to avoid duplication&#13;
and ensure complementary objectives between the two projects. It has been agreed that&#13;
the proposed project focuses mainly on tariff and power sector reform and the ADB&#13;
project includes greater focus on environmental control at the provincial level through&#13;
improvements in environmental monitoring and enforcement, and closure of small&#13;
industrial boilers and small inefficient power plants (see Box 4.1). Therefore, the&#13;
proposed project includes investment, power sector reform, electricity conservation pilot&#13;
projects, and institutional development components as follows:&#13;
(a)   construction of two 600-MW coal-fired thermal power units and associated&#13;
equipment and facilities, including, for the first time in China, an online&#13;
performance monitoring system to increase plant performance, reduce coal&#13;
consumption and gradually introduce innovative maintenance techniques;&#13;
(b)   erection of two 165 km 500-kV transmission lines to connect the power&#13;
plant to the existing power transmission network;&#13;
(c)   services to assist the beneficiary in engineering, procurement and&#13;
construction supervision;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
(d)    a technical assistance package to support the implementation of the power&#13;
sector reform action plan described in paras. 3.10-3.16;&#13;
Box 4. 1: PROPOSED ADB HENAN POWER PROJECT&#13;
Part A: First stage of the new Yuzhou Coal-Fired Power Station including ash disposal yards, access&#13;
roads, railway extension, water pipelines, and 250 circuit-km of 220 kV transmission&#13;
reinforcement with costing based on 350 MW units and international competitive bidding based&#13;
on 300-350 MW series;&#13;
Part B: Cogeneration Plan including (B1) conversion of small Yuzhou City 2x6 MW  plant, thereby&#13;
allowing the closure of 10 industrial boilers in Yuzhou City; and (B2) construction of new&#13;
2x142 MW cogeneration station in Luoyang, thereby allowing the closure of an additional 146&#13;
industrial and 113 residential boilers;&#13;
Part C: Closure of 21 inefficient, polluting and aging generating units from four power stations located in&#13;
Zhengzhou, Luoyang and Jiaozuo with total capacity 307 MW and their replacement by more&#13;
efficient capacity created under the Project;&#13;
Part D: Development of greening in public areas and forestry plantations and orchards in and around&#13;
Yuzhou City over a five-year period involving the planting of about 275 million trees such that&#13;
the reforestation rate for Yuzhou City will be improved from 16.5 to 20 percent. This program is&#13;
in addition to project-specific green belts associated with Part A above.&#13;
Improving Environmental Monitoring and Enforcement in Henan Province. The objectives&#13;
of the TA are to: (a) strengthen the capability of both the Yuzhou Environmental Protection Bureau&#13;
(YEPB) and EPH Yuzhou Power Station Environmental Protection Unit in monitoring and enforcing&#13;
environmental rules and regulations; (b) improve the capability of EPH and YEPB to monitor coal quality&#13;
and EPH to enforce a system of bonuses and penalties, thereby inducing the mines to deliver good-quality&#13;
coal; and (c) update the mines on current practices and technologies to upgrade their product quality.&#13;
Although EPH would be the Executing Agency, the main focus of the TA will be on improving&#13;
the monitoring and enforcement capabilities of YEPB and EPH Yuzhou Power Station Environmental&#13;
Protection Unit. The TA will be implemented over a calendar period of four months by a team of&#13;
individual international and local consultants specializing in environmental management and clean coal&#13;
technology, including coal sampling and analysis.&#13;
Source:  Excerpt from the ADB Project Report (published with the authorization of the Chinese&#13;
government).&#13;
(e)    an electricity conservation component to support EPH's efforts in improving&#13;
demand side efficiency through market incentives rather than administrative&#13;
means; and&#13;
(f)    technical assistance, consulting services and training programs to build the&#13;
beneficiary's capabilities in power system operation and management&#13;
practices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
4.3    The two generation units to be constructed under the proposed project consist of&#13;
subcritical, drum-type boilers with low NO, burners, single shaft condensing turbines and&#13;
600 MW generators. They share a single 240-m stack. The plant's design coal is a blend&#13;
in the ratio of 1 part bituminous, 2 parts lean, and 1 part washed middlings, having an&#13;
aggregate sulfur and ash content of 0.41 percent and 24.95 percent, respectively.&#13;
Emission controls consist of electrostatic precipitators with an efficiency of 99.6 percent&#13;
for removal of dust from the gas emissions. The plant will also include an online&#13;
monitoring system to maximize efficiency and reduce coal consumption and provide&#13;
useful data for preventive maintenance (see Annx 4.1).&#13;
4.4   Two 165 km 500-kV transmission lines and two 750 MVA transformers will&#13;
connect the plant to the existing power system. The lines will be supported by a total of&#13;
408 steel towers of the guyed V-type, 38 m total height and 28 m width. The existing&#13;
towers of the Yellow River crossing are 114 m total height (see Annex 4.1).&#13;
Electricity Conservation Component&#13;
4.5    As part of the preparation of the proposed project, EPH carried out, with the&#13;
assistance of BERI, an integrated resource planning exercise. The study, Electricity&#13;
Conservation in Henan Province, highlighted the economic benefits of electricity&#13;
conservation investments and showed that the implementation of an aggressive electricity&#13;
conservation program could alleviate electricity shortages and reduce the required&#13;
generation capacity by 1,200 MW over the next seven years. It also indicated that, over&#13;
the same period, coal consumption for power generation could be reduced by 10 million&#13;
tons.  The potential and identified technologies were reviewed and confirmed by&#13;
international consultants during appraisal.&#13;
4.6    According to the prevailing Chinese administrative regulations, only the&#13;
provincial "Three Electricity Office" is mandated to implement social electricity&#13;
conservation (outside the power sector) projects. However, given EPH's strong interest&#13;
in electricity conservation, it was discussed and agreed to include in the proposed project&#13;
a $ 10 million loan component to:&#13;
(a)    develop  pilot/demonstration  projects aimed  at reducing  electricity&#13;
consumption through introduction of state-of-the-art technologies such as&#13;
variable speed motor control systems; low loss transformers, high&#13;
efficiency welding machines, etc.;&#13;
(b)   implement a pilot/demonstration project of power loss reduction in the&#13;
urban distribution system;&#13;
(c)    demonstrate the viability of innovative commercially-based contractual&#13;
and financing mechanisms; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
(d)   develop adequate monitoring procedures and test new and market-oriented&#13;
approaches, especially performance contracting and leasing, to speed up&#13;
the implementation of electricity conservation projects.&#13;
4.7   EPH initiated the selection of the projects to be included in the electricity&#13;
conservation component according to the following principles: financial and economic&#13;
profitability, measurability, technical innovation and replicability.   Annex 4.2&#13;
summarizes:  (a) the ongoing electricity conservation program  in Henan, (b) the&#13;
principles and criteria that guided the selection and would guide the implementation of&#13;
the conservation project; and (c) a concise description and cost estimate of the projects to&#13;
be undertaken under this component, a costibenefit analysis of the selected projects, and a&#13;
time-bound two-year implementation plan.&#13;
Project Design and Consulting Services&#13;
4.8   The project feasibility study and design report were completed by the Northwest&#13;
Electric Power Design Institute (NWEPDI) in 1993, and revised in September 1994. The&#13;
project was approved by SPC in 1992. Following the Bank's Guidelines, international&#13;
engineering consultants are being selected to assist in finalizing designs, procurement of&#13;
goods and works, and construction management (Annex A43). Funding in the amount of&#13;
$2.45 million out of the China Reform, Institutional Support and Preinvestment Project-&#13;
CRISPP (Credit 2447-CHA) has been approved for engineering and preparation of the&#13;
project. A first version of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) was&#13;
prepared in 1993 by NWEPDI.  The report was revised with the assistance of&#13;
international consultants to conform with the Chinese and Bank environmental&#13;
procedures and guidelines for thermal power projects and finalized in April 1995. The&#13;
EIAR has been approved by all Government authorities, and its summary was distributed&#13;
to the Executive Directors on May 1, 1995. The overall project concept and design is&#13;
satisfactory.&#13;
Management Development and Training&#13;
4.9   To meet EPH's long-term staffing requirements and to further develop EPH's&#13;
management capability, a comprehensive training program is included under the&#13;
proposed project. It consists of the following: (a) training in utility management and&#13;
financial planning; (b) project-related training for technical staff; and (c) upgrading of&#13;
and equipment for EPH's training facilities. It is estimated that 394 staff in various&#13;
fields, totaling 863 staff-months, will be trained abroad and in China (see Annex4.4A).&#13;
Assurances were obtained from EPH that it would carry out the management&#13;
development and training program as agreed with the Bank.&#13;
C. COST ESTIMATE&#13;
4.10 The total cost of the project is estimated at $1,161.1 million equivalent, excluding&#13;
interest during construction (IDC), of which $497.4 million (43 percent) represents the&#13;
foreign exchange component.  Table 4.1 provides a summary of the project cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
breakdown. The cost estimates reflect mid-1995 prices and are based on the recent&#13;
tendering information available for similar projects, including prices for major generating&#13;
equipment and control systems. Physical contingencies are calculated at 10 percent for&#13;
preparatory and other works, local cost of equipment and services, and 5 percent for the&#13;
costs of plant equipment and materials, and transmission facilities. Price-contingency&#13;
allowances for foreign costs estimated in US dollars are calculated according to&#13;
anticipated international price increases of 2.4 percent a year on average for the period&#13;
1996-2002 and 4.5 percent for 1995. The price escalation for costs expressed in local&#13;
currency is calculated according to projected domestic inflation rates of 14.0 percent for&#13;
1995, 10.5 percent for 1996, 8.5 percent for 1997, 7.0 percent for 1998 and 6.5 percent&#13;
for 1999 and 6.2 percent for 2000-03. The exchange rate used in the cost estimate was&#13;
Y 8.43 for $1.&#13;

D. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
4.11  The total financing requirements (including IDC of $250.2 million equivalent),&#13;
are estimated at $1,411.3 million equivalent. Central China Electric Power Group&#13;
Company CCEPGC (50 percent), Henan Provincial Construction and Investment&#13;
Company (HPCIC) (30 percent), and EPH (20 percent) will cover the financing of the&#13;
local cost and IDC. The loans provided by CCEPG and HPCIC will have a variable&#13;
interest rate (currently 15.1 percent a year) and 11 years maturity, including 3 years'&#13;
grace. Fifteen percent of the total cost will be provided by CCEPG and HPCIC in the&#13;
form of convertible loans, which can be converted to equity contributions to the new&#13;
company if the financiers decide to establish a limited liability company for the project&#13;
later. The local financial arrangements are acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.12  The foreign cost for the project estimated at $497.4, excluding IDC of $85.2&#13;
million, will be covered by the proposed loan of $440 million, a credit of $2.45 million&#13;
under CRISPP from the Bank and a cofinancing program of about $55 million from&#13;
international commercial lenders. Details of the financing plan are summarized in Table&#13;
4.2. The Bank loan will be used to finance the following project items:&#13;
(a)   major power plant equipment, including boilers, turbine-generators, and&#13;
instrumentation and control islands;&#13;
(b)   500-kV substation equipment;&#13;
(c)   construction equipment and materials;&#13;
(d)   consulting services for engineering and construction management;&#13;
(e)   environmental management program;&#13;
(f)   organizational restructuring and development of accounting and financial&#13;
management systems; and&#13;
(g)   management development and training; and&#13;
(h)   part of the electricity conservation equipment.&#13;

4.13  The proposed Bank loan will be made to the People's Republic of China at the&#13;
Bank's standard variable interest rate for a 20-year term, including 5 years' grace.&#13;
Proceeds of the loan would be onlent from the Government to EPH with Henan&#13;
Provincial Government's guarantee at the same terms as the Bank loan. Assurances were&#13;
obtained from the Government that it would onlend the proceeds of the proposed Bank&#13;
loan to EPH under a subsidiary loan agreement with a term of 20 years, including a 5-&#13;
year grace period, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. EPH will bear the&#13;
foreign exchange risk.  Execution of the subsidiary loan agreement between the&#13;
Government and EPH by the State Council will be a condition of effectiveness for the&#13;
loan.&#13;
4.14  The foreign costs gap will be covered by commercial cofinancing of $55 million&#13;
equivalent which consists of two tranches: a $30 million Eurodollar syndicated loan&#13;
(Dollar loan), and a Yen 2.5 billion ($25 million equivalent) private placement (Yen&#13;
loan). Under the cofinancing scheme, commercial lenders are providing funds with a&#13;
final maturity of 15 years to China, represented by the Ministry of Finance. The proceeds&#13;
will be onlent by the MOF on the same terms to the beneficiary, EPH. MOF conducted&#13;
price inquiry for the financing in October 1995 with financial institutions that indicated&#13;
interest during earlier market soundings and awarded conditional mandate to: (a) a group&#13;
of six commercial banks for the Dollar loan; and (b) a life insurance company for the Yen&#13;
loan. The mandated interest rates for the Dollar loan and the Yen loan are 0.43 and 0.30&#13;
percent per year, respectively, over the relevant 6-month LIBOR. These terms, achieved&#13;
with a comfort of cofinancing arrangement, are very favorable for the final maturity of 15&#13;
years, including 5-year grace period. They are below the average pricing of commercial&#13;
bank borrowing (about LIBOR+0.5-0.6 percent) by Chinese sovereign entities for a much&#13;
shorter maturity of five to seven years.&#13;
E. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.15  Procurement arrangements and the related procurement schedules for various&#13;
packages are given in Annex 4.5. The Bank's Procurement Guidelines (January 1995&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
version) will be applied to all Bank-financed procurement. The Bank loan will be largely&#13;
disbursed against plant equipment and materials, and major equipment contracts for&#13;
transmission systems through international competitive bidding (ICB). Five contracts&#13;
amounting to about $10 million in total for consulting services covering environmental&#13;
studies, engineering and construction management, organizational restructuring and&#13;
financial management systems, legal framework, and tariff studies will be awarded in&#13;
accordance with Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants. Some specialized equipment&#13;
estimated to cost less than $300,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount of $6 million&#13;
and which can only be purchased from a limited number of suppliers, regardless of the&#13;
cost thereof, will be procured through limited international bidding (LIB). Goods,&#13;
instruments and accessories needed for construction and operation of the power plant,&#13;
including equipment for environmental monitoring and training, which are readily&#13;
available off-the-shelf or are standard specification commodities, and which are estimated&#13;
to cost less than $300,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount of $2.5 million, will be&#13;
procured through contracts awarded on the basis of international shopping procedures for&#13;
up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $2 million or national shopping procedures for&#13;
up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $0.5 million. Goods of a proprietary nature may&#13;
be procured through direct contracting with the Bank's prior agreement up to an&#13;
aggregate amount not to exceed $0.5 million.  For the Electricity Conservation&#13;
Component, equipment for distribution loss reduction and high-efficiency transformers&#13;
will be procured through ICB. International and national shopping will be applied to&#13;
miscellaneous equipment, and technical services.&#13;
4.16 Because of foreign exchange limitations, civil works (fully locally financed) and&#13;
non-Bank-financed equipment will be procured locally through competitive bidding&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank, particularly for 220 kV transmission and substation&#13;
components, where local contractors and suppliers are fully capable and very competitive.&#13;
The procurement procedures for non-Bank-financed components will not adversely affect&#13;
the execution of the project in terms of cost, quality or completion time.&#13;
4.17 In ICB procurement, model bidding documents developed in consultation with the&#13;
Bank would be used, and goods and components of goods manufactured in China would&#13;
be eligible for a 15 percent (or import duties, whichever is less) preference in bid&#13;
evaluation. The proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3.&#13;
4.18  Prior review would apply to all Bank-financed contracts for goods, with an&#13;
estimated cost of $5 million equivalent or above (about 94 percent of the loan). Prior&#13;
review would also apply to the first three contracts under $5 million. Other contracts&#13;
would be subject to selective post-award review. Prior review would also be required for&#13;
all consultancy contracts with an estimated cost exceeding $50,000 for individuals, or&#13;
$100,000 for firms. Exceptions to prior review would not apply to the terms of reference&#13;
for all consultancy contracts and single-source selection of consulting firms.&#13;

F. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
4.19 EPH will be responsible for project implementation and operation. A specialized&#13;
construction  unit has  been  established  to  manage  site  construction  activities.    Its&#13;
organizational structure is shown in Chart 3. Preparatory works including access roads&#13;
and construction power supply started in January 1995 and have been progressing&#13;
satisfactorily. The bidding documents for the procurement of the main boiler and turbine-&#13;
generator packages are scheduled to be issued in January 1996 to be opened in April&#13;
1996. The commercial operation of the first generating unit is expected in end-March&#13;
2001 and the second unit by the end of December 2001. Thus, the project completion&#13;
date would be December 30, 2002 and the closing date of the Bank loan would be&#13;
June 30, 2003. Chart 4 presents the implementation schedule for the various components&#13;
of the project. Furthermore, key dates of project implementation are given in Annex 4.6,&#13;
and estimated annual contractual and other payments are summarized Table 4.4.&#13;

G. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.20      The  Bank  loan  will  be  disbursed  against:    (a) 100 percent  of  the  foreign&#13;
expenditures for directly imported equipment and materials quoted on a c.i.f. basis;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
(b) 100 percent of local expenditures ex-factory for locally manufactured items, and&#13;
75 percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally; and (c) 100 percent of&#13;
the expenditure for consulting services and training. For expenditures pertaining to goods&#13;
contracts valued at less than $5,000,000 (except for the first three such contracts),&#13;
consultancy contracts valued at less than $100,000 for firms and $50,000 for individuals&#13;
and all training, reimbursement will be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures.&#13;
Supporting documents need not be submitted to the Bank but will be retained in the EPH&#13;
office for review by Bank supervision missions. To facilitate disbursements under this&#13;
project, a Special Account will be established with an authorized allocation of $15&#13;
million, representing approximately four months of average project disbursements.&#13;
Applications for replenishment will be submitted monthly or when the amounts&#13;
withdrawn equal 50 percent of the initial deposit, whichever comes sooner. Annex 4.7&#13;
presents the disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan as well as a standard&#13;
profile of disbursements for all sectors in China. The disbursements are expected to be&#13;
completed in six years, very close to the standard disbursement profile for China. The&#13;
last year is for payment of retention money.&#13;
H. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RESETTLEMENT&#13;
4.21  In accordance with OD 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), the project has been&#13;
assigned to Category A. The Environmental Assessment (EA), prepared with the&#13;
assistance of international consultants specializing in environmental issues related to&#13;
thermal power plants, has been approved by the Environmental Protection Bureau of&#13;
Henan Province and the National Environmental Protection Agency. The EA has been&#13;
reviewed by the World Bank; it is considered that all environmental aspects of the project&#13;
are satisfactorily addressed and in compliance with all Chinese and World Bank&#13;
environmental regulations, policies and procedures. The project has been designed and&#13;
will be carried out in accordance with modem concepts of environmental management.&#13;
Consequently, the project should cause minimum disturbance to the environment. A&#13;
monitoring program will be incorporated to ascertain and verify these conclusions on a&#13;
sustained basis.&#13;
4.22  The project is a greenfield operation located in a semirural agricultural area of&#13;
Jiyuan municipality in the northwestern part of Henan Province, about 17 km to the&#13;
northwest of Jiyuan city. Alternative locations for the power plant had been considered.&#13;
The selected site for the power plant, at the foot of Taihang and Wangwushan mountains,&#13;
received the highest environmental ranking. It uses land that is currently uninhabited, too&#13;
poor for cultivation and offers the best possibilities for dispersion of flue gases, thus&#13;
avoiding relocation of population and providing the smallest impact on the natural and&#13;
human environment. It will require acquisition of a total of 290 ha of land, of which only&#13;
14 ha, required by the transmission line, are cultivated.  The construction of the&#13;
transmission lines and substations will require very limited relocation of population&#13;
unless routing changes will be required due to unidentified technical and/or soil&#13;
problems.  A  land acquisition and relocation document (LARP-I) defining the&#13;
resettlement policies, planning principles, institutional arrangements and design criteria&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
for the estimated maximum resettlement that could be caused by the project, was&#13;
prepared by EPH (Annax4.8A). It was agreed that EPH will: (a) carry out the&#13;
environmental management program in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; (b) prepare a&#13;
final Land Acquisition and Relocation Plan (LARP-II) when the final survey and detailed&#13;
engineering of the 500 kV lines and substations are completed; and (c) carry out the&#13;
LARP-II as agreed with the Bank The Borrower will submit the LARP-II for Bank&#13;
approval prior to the procurement of equipment for the construction of the lines and&#13;
substations and this will be a condition for disbursement for that equipment..&#13;
4.23 Modern pollution control technologies will be incorporated into the design of the&#13;
power plant, such as high-efficiency electrostatic precipitators and low NO, burners.&#13;
Additionally, the plant layout provides adequate space to install additional pollution&#13;
control systems if required as a result of future changes in Chinese standards and/or&#13;
technological developments. Annex 4.9 provides a summary of key environmental issues&#13;
associated with the project and their anticipated impacts, the mitigating plan to assure&#13;
these impacts are minimized, and the monitoring program with which environmental&#13;
impacts will be measured and compared with EA predictions. Further strengthening of&#13;
EPH institutional capabilities is included in the project design. It will cover both training&#13;
and acquisition of appropriate environmental monitoring equipment (see Annex 4.9, Part&#13;
C). Moreover, mitigation measures identified in the EA and included into the project&#13;
design for the transmission lines include: adequate tower placement to minimize impact&#13;
on farm fields, a 100-meter corridor to place the transmission lines as far as possible from&#13;
population centers, and sufficient height of the line span, at the point of maximum line&#13;
slack, to avoid interference with road traffic.&#13;
4.24  Environmental issues associated with the project (power station and transmission&#13;
line) and addressed in the EA included all concerns expressed by affected parties in a&#13;
series of public meetings. The local public and local authorities support the project and&#13;
the recommended mitigating measures offered in the EA. The mitigation and monitoring&#13;
plans presented in the EA (see Annex 4.9, Parts B and C) will be fully implemented.&#13;
4.25  Key issues addressed in the EA include: air pollution (dust, sulfur dioxide), water&#13;
pollution (primarily groundwater at the ash disposal site), coal storage and handling, ash&#13;
disposal, worker health and safety, electric field, noise and bird flight patterns&#13;
(transmission line), and the influence of the construction and operation labor force on the&#13;
local infrastructure. Furthermore, the proposed project (2 units of 600 MW) is the first&#13;
phase of an overall program to develop 3,600 MW at the Qinbei site. To avoid future&#13;
adverse environmental consequences, the EA examined both the immediate impacts of&#13;
the subject project (1,200 MW) as well as the cumulative impacts of the overall&#13;
3,600 MW program.&#13;
4.26 All mitigating measures for air, water, and solids management (coal, ash) are&#13;
designed to meet appropriate Chinese requirements and/or World Bank guidelines,&#13;
whichever is stricter. In the absence of either, international standards of codes of practice&#13;
will be used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39-&#13;
I. REPORTING AND MONITORING&#13;
4.27  Satisfactory performance indicators and procedures for monitoring, evaluating,&#13;
and reporting on the project have been discussed with and agreed by EPH. The Bank&#13;
would be furnished with semiannual and annual project progress reports, The annual&#13;
project progress reports would include, inter alia, EPH's proposals regarding project costs&#13;
and financing plan for the following year. The scope and content of the project progress&#13;
reports have also been agreed.&#13;
4.28  With regard to the construction of the Qinbei power plant and transmission lines,&#13;
monitoring of costs, quality and schedule is the main function of the project unit within&#13;
EPH, and their consultants. The Bank will monitor procurement progress in accordance&#13;
with the procurement schedule in Annex 4.5, and construction progress in accordance&#13;
with the schedule of Chart 4 and the key dates in the main contracts, of which major&#13;
milestones are set out in Annex 4.6. Overall costs will be monitored in accordance with&#13;
Table 4.1. The guiding principles for the resettlement are described in Annex 4.9 and&#13;
detailed indicators will be defined in the RAP. The responsibility for environmental&#13;
monitoring is comprehensively presented in Annex 4.9. Key data for the implementation&#13;
of the reform plan is provided in the matrix at the end of Annex 3.3.&#13;
4.29  The Bank supervision plan attached in Annex 4.10 will focus on the core&#13;
activities of the project implementation and achievement of the agreed objectives. These&#13;
include physical construction, environmental management, the resettlement plan&#13;
(including compensation), corporatization of EPH, power sector reform in Henan&#13;
Province, and the financial covenants set out in Table 5.2. The key monitoring indicators&#13;
of each of the objectives sought through the proposed project are provided in Annex 4.1 1.&#13;

5. FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
5.1   EPH follows MOF financial regulations applicable to state-owned enterprises.&#13;
These regulations have gradually evolved over the last decade from a system in which all&#13;
investment funds were provided by the Government and all surpluses remitted to it, to&#13;
one which provides some autonomy and incentives for efficiency.&#13;
5.2   The new accounting principles and financial rules effective July 1, 1993 will have&#13;
far-reaching impacts on the sector. First, they require power entities to clarify and&#13;
separate debt from equity. This is an important step for power entities moving toward&#13;
limited liability companies and eventually shareholding companies. Diversification of&#13;
ownership is critical to mobilizing more resources to the sector. Secondly, under the new&#13;
profit allocation system specified in the new financial rules issued by MOF, the&#13;
adjustment tax and special fund allocations have been abolished. The management of&#13;
power entities are given greater autonomy in making decisions on profit distribution.&#13;
Thirdly, enterprises are permitted to design their own internal accounting and financial&#13;
management system based on their business needs. Overall, the new financial rules&#13;
together with the rationalization of state assets management, and other fiscal and financial&#13;
sector reforms, will lead the state to gradually play an ownership role rather than being&#13;
involved in the management of power entities. With new autonomy and increased&#13;
accountability power entities will also have an incentive to improve their budgetary and&#13;
cost controls as well as cash management in order to stay competitive in a market-&#13;
oriented environment.&#13;
5.3   The Government promulgated a series of important new tax laws at the end of&#13;
1993. From 1994, the negotiated contract responsibility system was replaced by a&#13;
uniform and simplified tax system. A corporate income tax rate of 33 percent is being&#13;
applied to all domestic enterprises. The old sales taxes (about 25 percent of sales) levied&#13;
for power generation and distribution were also replaced by a new value-added tax (VAT)&#13;
at 17 percent. The new tax policy does not necessarily reduce the tax burden for power&#13;
entities. However, it eliminates the lengthy and complicated negotiations between&#13;
enterprises and the Government. More importantly, it is conducive to strengthening the&#13;
planning and financial management functions of the power companies.&#13;
5.4   The power sector was selected as one of the sectors under experiment for assets&#13;
revaluation in 1993. The exercise has been undertaken in five steps: (a) inventory check&#13;
of the existing assets; (b) classification of ownership (source of investment for all assets);&#13;
(c) revaluation of fixed assets; (d) validating cash position; and (e) property right&#13;
registration. All power companies, regional, provincial, and municipal, have completed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41 -&#13;
the work up to the fourth step and now are awaiting the central government to issue state&#13;
assets management implementation regulations in order to carry out the final step.&#13;
5.5    The  methodology  used  in  revaluing  assets  is generally  consistent with&#13;
international practice. Four methods in the following order have been tested in the&#13;
revaluation exercise: (a) price indexed approach; (b) price quotations specified in the&#13;
revaluation booklet; (c) replacement cost approach; and (d) foreign cost adjustment for all&#13;
imported equipment. Both gross and net fixed assets have been revalued according to the&#13;
booklet issued by the Government. The Central Enterprise Division in MOF's Finance&#13;
Bureau in the power company's jurisdiction is responsible for reviewing whether the&#13;
exercise is done properly. The results of revaluation have been double checked by the&#13;
regional power company which is administratively in charge of the provincial or&#13;
municipal company. Finally, the Central Enterprise Division of the Finance Bureau in&#13;
the regional power company's jurisdiction is responsible for validation of the revaluation&#13;
results.&#13;
B. EPH's PAST AND PRESENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
5.6    EPH's financial performance in the past was generally satisfactory. It has been&#13;
able to meet the financial covenants in connection with the previous Bank-financed&#13;
Yanshi project (Loan 3433-CHA). EPH's income statements, balance sheets, and funds&#13;
flow  statements for the period 1990-94 are set out in Annex 5.1.  Key ratios and&#13;
indicators highlighting its past and present finances are summarized in Table 5.1.&#13;

the 1993 ending balance of foreign currency loans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
5.7   The decline in net profit observed in 1994 after three years of steady increase, is&#13;
mainly due to different accounting treatments of depreciation and interest expenses, and&#13;
new tax laws enacted in 1994. Operating costs increased dramatically in 1994 mostly&#13;
because of the accelerated depreciation methods implemented by mid-1993 and higher&#13;
taxation rate following the implementation of the new VAT.&#13;
5.8   Under the previous Bank loan for the Yanshi Thermal Power Project, EPH agreed&#13;
to maintain its net operating income equivalent to not less than (a) 20 percent of its&#13;
average annual investment program for the years 1992-94, and (b) 25 percent thereafter,&#13;
and not to incur any debt unless its debt service coverage ratio is greater than 1.3 times.&#13;
EPH's net operating incomes were 24.2 percent, 26.2 percent and 22.2 percent of three&#13;
years' average capital expenditures in 1992, 1993, and 1994 respectively. The debt&#13;
service coverage ratios in 1992, 1993, and 1994 were 2.1, 1.7 and 1.8 times, respectively.&#13;
Therefore, EPH has met the financial performance targets set out under the previous loan.&#13;
5.9   The pre-1993 financial statements have limited value as predictors of future&#13;
performance, because of several factors:&#13;
(a)   Fixed assets and accumulated depreciation provisions were revalued in&#13;
1993 but not in previous years;&#13;
(b)   Depreciation rates were increased in 1993; power plant equipment is now&#13;
amortized over 12 years, well below its economic/technical life;&#13;
(c)   Value of construction work-in-progress and related sources of funds were&#13;
not recorded in EPH's accounts; and&#13;
(d)   New financial regulations, mostly based on International Accounting&#13;
Standards (IAS), effective July 1, 1993, have required financial statements&#13;
to follow the definitions and classifications of accounts promulgated by&#13;
MOF, which are different from those under the old accounting system.&#13;
C. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TARGETS&#13;
5.10  A self-financing ratio was chosen to promote prudent financial management and&#13;
adequate tariff levels for two reasons: (a) the ownership of EPH's assets cannot be&#13;
clarified and decided before issuance of the State Council regulations related to the&#13;
implementation of the new Company Law, and, (b) mobilization of funds to meet the&#13;
important investment needs of the power sector will remain one of the most important&#13;
challenges in Henan Province. The self-financing ratio will also be easy to monitor.&#13;
5.11  The rationale for raising the final target of the self-financing ratio from 25 percent&#13;
under the previous Bank loan (para. 5.8) to 35 percent by the year 2000 are threefold:&#13;
(a) EPH's internal tariff projection, with an increasing share of new-generation units&#13;
entering into the rate base by the end of the century, suggests a higher tariff level than a&#13;
self-financing ratio of 25 percent can achieve; (b) EPH's current tariff level is well below&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
the long-run marginal cost and a higher self-financing ratio is aimed to bring up the tariff&#13;
level close to the economic price by the year 2000; and (c) EPH has increased the&#13;
depreciation rate from 4.73 percent to 7.18 percent of the gross fixed assets under&#13;
operation since 1994 and is no longer obligated to contribute to the "two funds" under the&#13;
new financial rules.&#13;
5.12   With a view  to promoting this reform  and prudent financial management,&#13;
assurances were obtainedfrom EPH that it will:&#13;
(a)   take all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff adjustments,&#13;
to ensure its internal cash surpluses, qfter meeting (i) cash operating&#13;
expenses; (ii) interest charged to operations; (iii) all taxes; (iv) gross&#13;
increases in working capital; and (iv) loan repayments, are sufficient to&#13;
maintain self-financing ratios of no less than 25 percent in 1996, 30 percent&#13;
during 199 7-1999, and 35 percent thereafter;&#13;
(b)   take all necessary measures, including but not limited to tariff adjustments,&#13;
to ensure its internal cash generation would provide a debt service coverage&#13;
ratio of no less than 1.5 times at all times, and&#13;
(c)   by April 30 of each year, fiurnish to the Bank a rolling eight-year financial&#13;
plan containing projected income statements, statements of sources and uses&#13;
offunds, and balance sheets.&#13;
5.13   By taking this approach, the magnitude of required tariff increases is significant.&#13;
With the large investment program anticipated and the current low tariff, major&#13;
adjustments need to be initiated. In order to meet these financial targets, projections&#13;
show that EPH's average price must be increased by a minimum of above 15 percent&#13;
(over 6 percent in real terms) per annum from the 1994 level as shown in Table 5.2&#13;
during the remainder of the 1 990s for EPH to make a reasonable contribution to its future&#13;
investment program.&#13;
D. FUTURE FINANCES&#13;
5.14  The projections of EPH's finances for 1995-2004 are presented in Annex 5.2, and&#13;
the salient features of these finances are highlighted below in Table 5.2. The projections&#13;
are based on the assumptions contained in Annex 5.3. The average prices shown depict&#13;
the minimum tariff adjustments needed to allow EPH to achieve the above financial&#13;
performance targets.&#13;
5.15   Table 5.2 shows the projected level of increases in purchased power prices, prices&#13;
for EPH's own generation, and the weighted average of those two that will be required to&#13;
meet the financial covenants. The prices for purchased power will be determined on a&#13;
plant-by-plant basis, at "debt service price" levels, allowing for full debt service based on&#13;
7- to 8-year repayment period after commissioning of new power plants.&#13;

5.16    EPH's financial position, however, depends on revenues that it collects from  its&#13;
own generation plants. In order to meet the expansion plan and projected cost increases&#13;
in the future and comply with the financial performance targets set forth above, EPH's&#13;
average tariff will need to increase by an estimated 11.7 percent in current terms or&#13;
4.0 percent in real terms a year from 1995 to 2004. Given the current low catalog prices,&#13;
18.9 fen/kWh in 1994 and 20.4 fen/kWh in 1995, EPH's own average revenue needs to&#13;
have a substantial increase of about 130 percent from 1994 (21.63 fen/kWh) to 2000&#13;
(50.24 fen/kWh) to achieve the final target self-financing ratio of 35 percent.&#13;
5.17    Although  the rate of increases in the catalog  prices required  to  achieve the&#13;
covenanted self-financing ratio for EPH are large, much of the increase should stem from&#13;
the entry of new generating plant into the rate base. Because of the rapid load growth, the&#13;
bulk of the tariff increase required will be met through implementation of the new pricing&#13;
principles. By 1996, more than half of EPH's own generation is expected to come from&#13;
plants built after 1993. By 2004, the share rises to 75 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-45 -&#13;
5.18  During the period 1995-2004, EPH is expected to maintain relatively high rates of&#13;
growth necessitated by the prospective strong economic growth in Henan Province.&#13;
Based on latest demand forecast and expansion plan assumptions, energy sales are&#13;
expected to rise by 138 percent over 1994 levels, representing a compound annual growth&#13;
rate of about 9.1 percent. EPH's annual investment program and net fixed assets in&#13;
operation are expected to expand by 219 and 562 percent over the period, an annual&#13;
increase of about 14 and 23 percent, respectively.&#13;
5.19 During 1995-2004, EPH's performance is anticipated to improve gradually and&#13;
steadily as the tariff level of EPH's own generation be raised to meet the financial targets,&#13;
from 21.68 fen/kWh in 1994 to 65.81 fen/kWh in 2004, tariff structure is further&#13;
rationalized, and self-financing as well as debt service requirements emerge as dominant&#13;
factors in pricing formulation. Based on the projected minimum tariff level, about&#13;
11.4 percent increase per year for its own generation and 14 percent for purchased power&#13;
from 1994 to 2004, both revenues and net incomes are expected to grow considerably&#13;
over the period. The rate of return on historically valued assets and on revalued assets&#13;
will improve significantly during 1995-2001 as the tariff level moving towards economic&#13;
prices and decline to a more sustainable level, 12 to 15 percent, afterwards.&#13;

6. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. LEAST COST STUDY&#13;
6.1   Henan Province has limited hydroelectric potential and large coal resources, and&#13;
is next to Shanxi Province, which has abundant resources of high quality coal. Therefore&#13;
state-of-the-art 300 and 600 MW coal-fired units are attractive candidates for the&#13;
provincial and regional development programs.  They complement hydropower&#13;
developments in Henan (Xiaolangdi, Loan 3727-CHA) and in neighboring provinces,&#13;
such as Hunan and Hebei, to ensure optimal and environmentally sustainable&#13;
development of the Central China power system.&#13;
6.2   During the preparation of the project, a least-cost expansion study was carried out&#13;
by BERI, covering 1996-2010 with a focus on 1996-2005. The study was carried out&#13;
using an optimization model that determines the optimal capacity and generation mix to&#13;
meet the demand with the minimum cost (net present value of investment and operating&#13;
costs), given a predetermined reliability criteria. It considered all potential candidates&#13;
including: power exchanges with neighboring provinces, distillate fueled combined cycle&#13;
plant, 300 and 600 MW coal-fired units, hydropower and pumped storage plants, and gas&#13;
turbines. It showed that the expansion program should be based, up to the year 2002, on&#13;
300 MW and 600 MW coal-fired units and that the proposed project is the first&#13;
investment of the optimal (least-cost) power development program.&#13;
6.3   Sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the proposed project, which remains&#13;
the first investment of the provincial expansion program(s) under a wide range of&#13;
assumptions:&#13;
(a)   the project will still be required by year 2001, even if the demand growth&#13;
would slow from projected 9 percent per year to only 6 percent between&#13;
1994 and 2001.&#13;
(b)   The project remains more economical than an equivalent combined cycle&#13;
power plant even if the cost of distillate were 46 percent lower than in the&#13;
base case ($113 per ton compared to $209 per ton) or if the investment&#13;
cost of combined cycle were 58 percent lower than in the base case ($250&#13;
per kW installed compared to $600 per kW installed).&#13;
(c)   The project remains the first investment of the least-cost program and is&#13;
still needed in 2001 even if the discount rate is increased from 12 to&#13;
16 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
6.4   A summary of the power development program (1994-2004) for the HPG system&#13;
is given in Annex 6. 1. The balances between power demand and supply are presented in&#13;
Annex 6.2. They demonstrate that the power system will be short of energy supply and&#13;
capacity up to the year 2001.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN&#13;
Power Plant and Transmission Components&#13;
6.5   The internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the proposed project was&#13;
calculated based on the estimated power price of 39 fen/kWh (in 1994 prices) that will be&#13;
paid for electricity at the 110/35 kV level in 2001, the first year of operation, based on&#13;
existing policies for pricing of power output from new power plants. This price, based on&#13;
revenues generated by the new power plant rather than the economic value of a shortfall&#13;
in electric power supply, underestimates the economic benefits of the project. It yielded&#13;
an IERR of about 15.2 percent&#13;
6.6   The IERR would decrease to the test discount rate of 12 percent, in the case of&#13;
one of the following occurrences:&#13;
(a)   the price paid at the 110/30 kV for electricity from new power plants were&#13;
20 percent lower than the base case price: i.e., 33 fen/kWh in 1994 prices;&#13;
(b)   the project were to experience a cost overrun of 26 percent;&#13;
(c)   the power plant operation were reduced to 5,160 hours per year;&#13;
(d)   the economic fuel cost were 70 percent higher than the base case;&#13;
(e)   the project were to experience a delay in commissioning of 29 months.&#13;
6.7   However, these occurrences are very unlikely because EPH has a very good&#13;
record in project implementation, the economic assumptions considered in the base case&#13;
are stringent ,and the financial covenants of the project would ensure that prices are high&#13;
enough to meet the economic viability requirements.. As examples, (a) the price paid by&#13;
new power plants in the province is already higher than the assumed price and prices&#13;
accepted for some of newly commissioned or under construction power plants are in the&#13;
range of 45-50 fen/kWh; and (b) EPH managed to build the Jiaozuo power plant&#13;
(6x200 MW) and the Bank supported Yanshi project (2x300 MW) within schedule and&#13;
without cost overruns, and (c) the cost per kW installed considered in the base case is&#13;
more than 20 percent higher than the cost of the latest Bank supported projects in China.&#13;
Environmental Benefits&#13;
6.8   The project has also significant environmental benefits. It improves the efficiency&#13;
of the generation system and reduces the average coal consumption by about 14 g/kWh.&#13;
Reduction in coal consumption amounts to more than 1.4 million tons in 2003, the year&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
after full commissioning of the plant. With the development of Xiaolangdi (multipurpose&#13;
hydro project-No. 3727-CHA), most of Henan's hydropower potential would have been&#13;
exploited and the only alternatives to Qinbei would be smaller and less efficient coal-&#13;
fired units. The electricity conservation component will also contribute in speeding up&#13;
the implementation of electricity conservation projects and significantly reduce the coal&#13;
consumption over the medium term (see para. 4.6).&#13;
C. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
6.9   All proposed technologies are currently in successful use in China. Cost estimate&#13;
risks have been addressed by advanced procurement action; bids for major components&#13;
have already been prepared before loan negotiations and issued prior to Board&#13;
presentation. The risk of delay in project construction due to project management&#13;
shortcomings is minimal because of the experience gained during the implementation of&#13;
the Jiaozuo and Yanshi projects, the timely staffing and training of personnel of the&#13;
Qinbei implementation unit , and the assistance provided by experienced engineering&#13;
consultants. The risk of nonperformance in the environmental and resettlement area has&#13;
been addressed by the establishment of appropriate monitoring organizations and&#13;
procedures (see para. 4.24). More importantly, sensitivity analyses show that even in&#13;
case of implementation of more stringent enviromnental standards requiring future&#13;
installation of FGD, the project would remain economically viable.&#13;
6.10 Delay in implementing power sector reforms in an efficient and timely manner&#13;
represents a risk that can jeopardize the progress toward more openness and efficiency of&#13;
the sector and more fiscal and managerial autonomy of EPH. This risk is minimized by&#13;
the strong commitment of Chinese to reform both at the central and provincial level. This&#13;
risk is also addressed through provision of required technical assistance and adequate&#13;
monitoring of implementation of the agreed upon reform plan during the project cycle (cf.&#13;
para. 3. 10).&#13;
6.11 The economic and financial risks would be minimal. In view of advanced&#13;
preparatory works, risks associated with project construction, cost overruns, and&#13;
implementation delays are within reasonable limits and manageable with the agreed&#13;
supervision and involvement of competent consultants. Particular attention will be given&#13;
to the safety aspects of the project, and to capability and performance of major&#13;
contractors.&#13;

ANNEX 3.1: POWER SECTOR STRUCTURE&#13;
IN HENAN PROVINCE&#13;
Institutional Framework&#13;
1.    There are four groups of enterprises associated with construction, management and&#13;
operation of the electric power sector in Henan Province:&#13;
(a)   provincial power enterprises;&#13;
(b)   prefectural/municipal power enterprises;&#13;
(c)   county power enterprises; and&#13;
(d)   power plant enterprises.&#13;
Provincial Power Enterprises&#13;
2.    The Electric Power of Henan (EPH) and Henan General Construction Investment&#13;
Company (HGCIC) are independent legal entities. EPH has the status of a limited-liability&#13;
company under its charters formulated pursuant to the law on State-Owned Enterprises.&#13;
3.    EPH is a state-owned enterprise administrated by Central China Electric Power&#13;
Administration (CCEPA) on behalf of MOEP. It is owned jointly by the central&#13;
government and the Henan Provincial Government. EPH is responsible for construction,&#13;
management and operation of generation, transmission and distribution in the province. It&#13;
has 31 dependent enterprises; 13 prefectural/municipal power enterprises, 7 power plant&#13;
enterprises, 4 power plants under construction (offices for management of projects under&#13;
construction), 2 technical school, 2 training school, a staff training center, a power test and&#13;
research center, and a power dispatch center. These subsidiaries have no separate legal&#13;
status and have commitments with EPH to achieve specific production and cost&#13;
performance. EPH collects all revenue from their electricity sales and pays their salaries&#13;
and operating costs.&#13;
4.    EPH also has 13 independent enterprises that are separate legal entities, which are&#13;
self-accounting and operate like subsidiaries. They include five service companies; for&#13;
material supply, consulting, fuel supply, industry and commerce and general construction;&#13;
four construction and installation companies; two factories for repair of equipment; one&#13;
investment company and one design institute. EPH controls them by appointing their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -                     ANNEX 3.1&#13;
management, limiting the size of their staff and salary levels. The service and construction&#13;
companies are required to pay dividends each year to EPH based on their profits.&#13;
5.    HGCIC is an enterprise owned by the Provincial Government, entrusted by it to&#13;
manage its investment in capital construction projects, mainly in transportation, power,&#13;
coal, raw material and industry sector, whether in the form of joint investment or joint&#13;
ventures. Administratively, it is affiliated with the Henan Provincial Planning and&#13;
Economic Commission. HGCIC's articles of association state that it is an investment&#13;
company administrated by the provincial government. HGCIC's income is derived mainly&#13;
from capital construction surcharges, including the 2 fen/kwh power construction fund, for&#13;
financing new construction and from dividends on its investments. It has the right to raise&#13;
funds and borrow to finance its investment on behalf of the Provincial Government.&#13;
6.    HGCIC has by the end of 1994 invested about Y 2.1 billion in twelve power&#13;
projects in Henan Province. These are contractual joint ventures (except Zhengzhou&#13;
Cogeneration Power Plant is ajoint-investment company with legal status). The contractual&#13;
joint ventures are with the central government, the provincial power company and&#13;
prefectural/municipal governments. HGCIC is responsible for making investment and it is&#13;
not involved in the construction, operation and management process. For contractual joint&#13;
venture power projects, EPH is entrusted to construct, manage and operate them on behalf&#13;
of all the investors.&#13;
Prefectural/Municipal Power Enterprises&#13;
7.    The prefectural/municipal power companies are responsible for power distribution&#13;
in the main cities of the province. Ten of these companies are part of EPH and have no&#13;
separate legal status. Four of these companies are separate legal entities independent from&#13;
EPH and they are owned by the respective prefectural/municipal governments. The&#13;
independent power companies purchase power from EPH on a wholesale basis and resell&#13;
the power to the county power companies or directly to the consumers.&#13;
County Power Enterprises&#13;
8.    There are 118 county-level power companies, most of whom have small coal-fired&#13;
plants and operate local distribution. All these companies are independent entities owned&#13;
by county governments. They purchase bulk power from EPH and sell any surplus to it&#13;
from their small thermal plants.&#13;
Power Plant Enterprises&#13;
9.    Henan Province has 13 large power plants. Firstly, there are seven state-owned&#13;
power plants operated by EPH. Four other plants are owned independently as joint&#13;
investments. However, EPH operates and manages them under contract and purchases their&#13;
output. Then, there is the Zhengzhou Cogeneration Power Plant (ZCPP), which is an&#13;
independent legal entity jointly owned by Xinli Company, HGCIC and EPH. ZCPP's daily&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -                     ANNEX 3.1&#13;
operation and maintenance is entrusted to EPH through an O&amp;M contract and its energy is&#13;
sold to EPH through a Power Purchase Agreement. Lastly, the Sanmenxia Hydropower&#13;
Plant is owned and operated by the Ministry of Water Resources, and its energy is&#13;
dispatched by and sold to EPH.&#13;
Regulatory Framework&#13;
10.   The main institutions involved with the regulation of the sector are:&#13;
(a)   State Planning Commission (SPC);&#13;
(b)   Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP);&#13;
(c)   Central China Electric Power Administration (CCEPA);&#13;
(d)   Henan Provincial Electric Power Bureau (HPEPB);&#13;
(e)   Henan Provincial Planning and Economic Commission (HPPEC);&#13;
(f)    Henan Provincial Price Bureau (HPPB);&#13;
(g)   Prefectural/Municipal Power Bureau; and&#13;
(h)   County Power Bureau&#13;
11.   There are several levels of regulation controlling the activities of the electric power&#13;
enterprises in Henan province. At the top are the central government agencies like the State&#13;
Planning Commission (SPC), which approves all large investments and tariff level for&#13;
energy produced by government grant financed plants, the Ministry of Electric Power&#13;
(MOEP), which formulates the major policies and legislation governing the power sector,&#13;
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic&#13;
Corporation (MOFTEC). At the regional level is the Central China Electric Power&#13;
Administration (CCEPA), which is delegated responsibility for administration of the&#13;
provincial power enterprises in the central China grid by MOEP.&#13;
12.   At the provincial level, the Henan Provincial Electric Power Bureau acts on behalf&#13;
of MOEP through CCEPA. Administratively, CCEPA is integrated with EPH and has the&#13;
same staff and management. Its main functions are to implement the laws and regulations&#13;
issued by the central government for the power sector. HPEPB administers the sector&#13;
enterprises, provides technical support to them and prepares the provincial power&#13;
development plan.&#13;
13.   The other main regulatory agency is the Henan Provincial Planning and Economic&#13;
Commission (HPPEC). HPPEC approves project investments up to Y 200 million. Above&#13;
this level, it submits proposed project to SPC for approval. It also approves fund raising by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -                      ANNEX 3.1&#13;
HGCIC such as surcharges and bond issues and power consumption quotas and allocations&#13;
based on monthly plans prepared by EPH. Prefecture-level power prices and prices for&#13;
above-quota power supply are also approved by HPPEC. HPPEC also, jointly with&#13;
HPEPA, approves the "network tariffs" of the new power plants built under joint-&#13;
investment projects.&#13;
14.   Finally, there are the Prefectural/Municipal and County-level bureau, which operate&#13;
like HPEPA and on its behalf at this level. In addition, power development enterprises&#13;
similar to HGCIC in the prefectures or in the counties, an electricity office (referred to as&#13;
the "three electricity office") approves investments, power allocations and retail prices.&#13;
These bodies also collect local surcharges from consumers and arrange investment of these&#13;
funds on behalf of county governments, mostly in distribution. The three specific functions&#13;
of the electricity offices are to take responsibility for electricity consumptions, conservation&#13;
and safety.&#13;

ANNEX 3.3: REFORM IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
ELECTRIC POWER OF HENAN&#13;
(MAY 1995)&#13;
1.    The Chinese Government has initiated various measures designed to meet the&#13;
requirements of the power sector within a socialist market economy and to establish a&#13;
modem enterprise system. This new system is based on: the clear definition of property&#13;
rights; commercial orientation and autonomous management; financial independence; and,&#13;
the separation of government ownership and regulation from enterprise management.&#13;
Electric Power of Henan (EPH) and Henan Provincial Electric Power Bureau (HPEPB)&#13;
have made some progress to achieve the above goals by: (a) completing the identification,&#13;
revaluation and registration of fixed assets; (b) initiating financial and accounting reforms&#13;
consistent with new rules and regulations issued by the Ministry of Finance; (c) developing&#13;
a new tariff structure to achieve economic pricing in five years; and (d) continuing&#13;
management system reforms according to the Regulations for Transformation of Operation&#13;
Mechanism of Enterprises Owned by the Whole People.&#13;
2.    These measures provide favorable conditions to develop China's power industry&#13;
and for a gradual transition to a socialist market economy. To further the progress achieved&#13;
it is now necessary to deepen reform. Accordingly, EPH and HPEPB have defined a&#13;
Reform Implementation Plan with the assistance of international consultants.&#13;
3.    This plan takes account of the Decision on Several Problems in Establishing the&#13;
Socialist Market Economy, the Company Law of the People's Republic of China, the&#13;
Regulations for Transformation of the Operating Mechanism of Enterprises Owned by the&#13;
Whole People, as well as the Power Sector Reform Strategy for China prepared jointly by&#13;
the Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP) and the World Bank.&#13;
4.    EPH, MOEP and Central China Electric Power Group Administration (CCEPGA)&#13;
confirm that the reforms planned will be fully implemented in accordance with the&#13;
applicable laws and implementing regulations-some of which are yet to be promulgated.&#13;
The reform actions, timing and linkage to the Qinbei Thermal Power Project loan are&#13;
summarized in the attached table.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-71-                            ANNEX3.3&#13;
Reform Objectives&#13;
5.     EPH has established the following reform objectives:&#13;
(a)    separation of government ownership, government regulation and enterprise&#13;
management; and, to establish a mechanism for effective and coordinated&#13;
regulation;&#13;
(b)    clear specification of EPH's commercial objectives and introduction of&#13;
management methods which are scientific and suited to the market system,&#13;
in order to increase management autonomy and accountability;&#13;
(c)    gradual rationalization of electricity tariffs to reach economic levels and&#13;
achieve financial adequacy;&#13;
(d)    the introduction of competition and market forces into the power sector.&#13;
6.     To attain these objectives, the Reform Implementation Plan defines a series of step-&#13;
by-step reforms involving: (a) incorporation of EPH as a limited liability company in&#13;
accordance with the Company Law; (b) separating the regulatory functions of the power&#13;
bureau from EPH; (c) commercialization of EPH's operations; (d) reforming tariffs to reach&#13;
economic and financially adequate levels; and, (e) restructuring the sector to introduce&#13;
competition at the generation level, and improve commercial contractual arrangements&#13;
between the different operating entities in the sector. This strategy is consistent with the&#13;
reforms outlined in the Power Sector Strategy Study developed jointly by the MOEP and&#13;
the World Bank. As an integrated package, subject to certain statutory approvals by the&#13;
State Council and the promulgation of supporting laws and regulations, these reforms will&#13;
be fully implemented by the end of 2000.&#13;
A. Corporatization of EPH&#13;
7.     EPH will be incorporated as a limited liability company under the new Company&#13;
Law.' The precise schedule for incorporation cannot be defined, because the State Council&#13;
has yet to issue implementing guidelines for restructuring state-owned enterprises as&#13;
Companies-Article 21, Chapter 2, of the Company Law. Towards achieving this goal&#13;
EPH has completed an asset valuation and verification of accounts.&#13;
8.     As a transitional step towards incorporation as a limited liability company (LLC),&#13;
EPH and MOEP explored the possibility of incorporating EPH as a Wholly State-Owned&#13;
1   The Company Law of the People's Republic of China specifies two broad corporate forms: Limited Liability&#13;
Companies and Joint Stock Limited Companies (Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 respectively, in the Company Law).&#13;
Under the category of Liability Liability Companies there are two organizational forms: (i). a limited liability&#13;
company (LLC) which has not less than two and not more than fifty shareholders; and, a wholly State-owned&#13;
limited liability company (WSOLLC) for state-owned enterprises that have a "single investing entity".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -                    ANNEX 3.3&#13;
limited liability Company (WSOLLC). It was established that even to be incorporated as a&#13;
WSOLLC it would require State Council implementing guidelines for restructuring state-&#13;
owned enterprises as Companies.&#13;
9.    To prepare for incorporation as a limited liability company, EPH will prepare&#13;
Articles of Association and internal regulations that will be consistent with the Company&#13;
Law. The Articles of Association (except for capital restructuring provisions which will&#13;
require State Council implementing regulations) will be prepared by June, 1995. According&#13;
to the Reform Implementation Plan, EPH will be incorporated as a limited liability&#13;
corporation within nine months of the issuance of the State Council implementing&#13;
regulations.&#13;
10.   EPH will also establish its state-owned generation plants as wholly-owned limited&#13;
liability companies (this is discussed in more detail in Section E, Sector Restructuring).&#13;
B. Separation of Government Functions from Enterprise&#13;
11.   An important reform objective is to separate government functions (i.e. regulatory&#13;
functions) from EPH. This reform is not entirely within the control of EPH, MOEP and&#13;
CCEPGA and will require additional government regulations on implementing power&#13;
sector reform. Consequently, EPH will adopt a two phase strategy. In the first phase,&#13;
which is within the control of EPH, all government functions will be consolidated within a&#13;
Power Bureau Department within EPH working independently from EPH operations. In&#13;
the second phase, the Power Bureau Department and the government functions it performns&#13;
will be completely separated from EPH. This second phase will need to be pursued in&#13;
accordance with an overall government program to establish effective power sector&#13;
regulation in China, as well as the province of Henan.&#13;
12.   EPH will begin the first phase immediately. All government functions being&#13;
performed by the Power Bureau will be identified and consolidated within a Power Bureau&#13;
Department. The new department will have its own Director, its own staff and be the only&#13;
departmnent that performs government functions. Internal company regulations and&#13;
procedures will be developed that will ensure that the Power Bureau Department will&#13;
operate separate from EPH, and will include procedures about: (a) the Power Bureau&#13;
Department's authority over EPH's operations; (b) communication between EPH's internal&#13;
divisions and external units and the Power Bureau Department; and (c) the Power Bureau&#13;
Departnent's communication with other government organizations.  The plan for&#13;
establishing the Power Department will be completed by June 1995, and implemented no&#13;
later than June 1996.&#13;
13.  Initiation of the second phase will need to await governmental reforms and&#13;
implementation directives. EPH, CCEPGA and MOEP have in principle agreed to achieve&#13;
formal separation of all government functions within nine (9) months of issuance of the&#13;
necessary regulations. Policy dialogue on this aspect of regulatory separation will continue,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-73 -                        ANNEX 3.3&#13;
more specifically through the IDF-financed technical assistance on power sector regulation&#13;
being managed by MOEP.&#13;
C. Commercialization of EPH Operations&#13;
14.   EPH will implement four types of reform to deepen commercialization.  The&#13;
reforms will include: (a) rationalizing noncore businesses from the core power business of&#13;
EPH, with gradual divestiture of noncore businesses; (b) establishing power supply bureaus&#13;
as independent accounting profit centers to operate based on a transparent bulk transfer&#13;
price; (c) restructuring of internal organization and improvement of management control&#13;
systems; and (d) implementing a suitable financial management and accounting system&#13;
appropriate to restructured internal organization.&#13;
Separation and Potential Transfer of Noncore Activities&#13;
15.   EPH has a number of activities that are either not related or ancillary to its power&#13;
activities. These activities have different degrees of financial autonomy, separation of costs&#13;
and commercial orientation. Several of the activities provide social services important to&#13;
EPH workers and staff. EPH will first review its external units to differentiate between&#13;
those subsidiary activities that are: (a) existing profit-centers with independent accounting&#13;
and separate legal status (Category A) such as the four Construction and Installation&#13;
Companies and the Industrial and Commercial Group; (b) cost-centers that can be&#13;
transformed into profit centers (Category B), such as the two Technical Schools and one&#13;
Training School for Skilled Workers; and (c) cost centers that mainly provide social and&#13;
welfare services (Category C).&#13;
16.   The review to differentiate EPH's noncore activities and classification into the three&#13;
categories (i.e. A, B and C) will be completed by June 1995. Category A entities, which are&#13;
already independent accounting profit-centers with separate legal status, will establish clear&#13;
commercial relationship based on contractual agreements with EPH by December 1996.&#13;
These commercial entities will be incorporated as Companies in accordance with the&#13;
Company Law when State Council guidelines on restructuring state-owned enterprises are&#13;
promulgated.&#13;
17.   Category B and C activities will first be set up as profit-centers and cost-centers&#13;
respectively. This will require appropriate transfer prices that reflect the costs of the&#13;
services being provided. This will be completed by December 1996. Category C cost-&#13;
centers will be separated once the government establishes suitable institutions and&#13;
mechanisms to facilitate separation.&#13;
Establishing Power Supply Bureaus as Independent Accounting Profit-Centers&#13;
18.   EPH will establish the thirteen (13) EPH-affiliated power supply bureaus as&#13;
independent accounting profit-centers to operate on the basis of: (a) a clear and transparent&#13;
bulk transfer price for electricity (also called the internal settlement price); and (b) a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -                      ANNEX3.3&#13;
commercial contractual arrangement that specifies performance targets providing a&#13;
framework for efficient operation and management of these power supply bureaus. The&#13;
tariff technical assistance will assist in developing the bulk transfer price for electricity (see&#13;
paragraph 22.of Section D), and the legal technical assistance will develop the required&#13;
contractual agreements.&#13;
Restructuring of Internal Organization and Management Control Systems and&#13;
Implementation of a Modern Accounting and Financial Management&#13;
Information System&#13;
19.   To successfully implement a commercially oriented organizational structure and&#13;
management systems consistent with the objective of improving operational efficiency, the&#13;
following actions will be undertaken:&#13;
(a)   a diagnostic study of the internal organization, operating and administrative&#13;
procedures. The assessment will determine how existing business units&#13;
functionally relate to each other and their respective scope of responsibility.&#13;
Overlapping lines of responsibility, excessive centralization of decision-&#13;
making and departments with excessively wide functional scope will be&#13;
identified.   An organizational structure that will improve internal&#13;
management will be identified. The functional boundaries of the different&#13;
departments, work units and subsidiaries. This could include the merging,&#13;
separation or elimination of certain functions. Correspondingly, this could&#13;
involve the strengthening or expansion of certain functions, for e.g. financial&#13;
operations at the headquarters and work unit level, establishing a division for&#13;
the competitive procurement of supply, etc.&#13;
(b)   assess accounting procedures, documentation, reporting formats and the&#13;
nature of financial transactions between the various departments, power&#13;
generation and supply entities, and service subsidiaries. The accounting&#13;
units and activities, reporting requirements, formats for information flow&#13;
and frequency of such information exchange will be redefined. A basic&#13;
design for the new financial and accounting information system will be&#13;
developed. The new financial and accounting management information&#13;
system be totally consistent with the proposed reorganization of business&#13;
processes and procedures.&#13;
(c)   The international consultants to perform and assist in the above diagnostic&#13;
and implementation activities will be financed from technical assistance&#13;
component in the project. The terms of reference for the task will be&#13;
prepared by June 1995, with the draft diagnostic report and implementation&#13;
plan to be completed by June 1996. All organizational reforms and the&#13;
implementation of the accounting and financial management information&#13;
systems, will be completed within two years of the submission of the&#13;
diagnostic report. The implementation of organizational reforms and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-75 -                       ANNEX3.3&#13;
accounting and financial management systems will be covenanted in the&#13;
project agreement.&#13;
D. Tariff Reform&#13;
20.   EPH's tariff reform plan is supported by the Chinese government agencies at the&#13;
Central and Provincial levels. The reform is founded on the following principles:&#13;
(a)   the tariff structure will be gradually adjusted to reflect the economic cost of&#13;
supply for different consumer classes in order to promote the efficient use of&#13;
electricity; and&#13;
(b)   the tariff levels will be gradually increased to reach economic levels by year&#13;
2000, to ensure that EPH can meet its financial obligations and provide&#13;
reasonable contribution for the future investment requirements of Henan's&#13;
power sector.&#13;
21.   It is recognized that tariff reform in Henan province will need to be consistent with&#13;
tariff reform guidelines of the relevant provincial and central government authorities, and&#13;
will be subject to their approval. However, any deviation from economic cost of supply&#13;
which require government subsidies should be fully transparent-implying that the total&#13;
amount of subsidies and the consumer groups benefiting from the subsidies are clearly&#13;
indicated&#13;
22.   Tariff System Implementation Study: EPH will prepare with the assistance of&#13;
foreign consultants an tariff implementation plan that ensures smooth transition from the&#13;
existing dual-track pricing system to a tariff system based on long-run marginal cost pricing&#13;
principles. This study will be initiated in August 1995 and the preliminary tariff system&#13;
presented to the World Bank for comments by March 15, 1996. The revised tariff system&#13;
which takes into account the comments and suggestions of the World Bank will be&#13;
proposed for Central and Provincial authorities for approval and finalized before June 30,&#13;
1996.&#13;
23.   The implementation plan for tariff reform should achieve-the average tariff level&#13;
increases agreed with EPH during project appraisal, approved by the relevant provincial&#13;
authorities before project negotiations and covenanted in the project agreement.&#13;
24.   The tariff system to be developed though the tariff study (paragraph 21), will&#13;
achieve the following tariff reform objectives:&#13;
(a)    Rationalization of Capacity Charge: Gradual increase of the capacity&#13;
charge, particularly for industrial and large commercial consumers, to more&#13;
accurately reflect the cost of electricity supply.  Future average price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -                      ANNEX 3.3&#13;
increases for these customers should be achieved through the increase of&#13;
capacity charge rather than the energy price.&#13;
(b)   Introduction and Extension of time-of-day (TOD) tariffs: Appropriate&#13;
TOD tariffs should be developed and offered to (not imposed) all consumers&#13;
who have the potential to benefit from load management. The objective is&#13;
to extend TOD tariffs to the whole province by year-200 according to the&#13;
following schedule:&#13;
-  1996  introduction for 400 large industrial consumers in 9&#13;
prefectures.&#13;
-  1997  extension to large industrial consumers in 4 additional&#13;
prefectures.&#13;
-  1998  1,000 more consumers, including commercial consumers.&#13;
- 2000  TOD tariff choice available to all consumers in the province.&#13;
(c)    Unification of Dual-track Tariffs: Through a suitable transitional strategy&#13;
the dual-track pricing system will be eliminated by more rapid increases of&#13;
"in-plan" electricity prices. The unification of tariffs should be completed as&#13;
early as possible, although no later than year- 1998.&#13;
(d)   Commercial Bulk Tariffs for Power Supply Bureaus: By-end 1997 all&#13;
power supply bureaus who are affiliated to EPH and those that are&#13;
independent should operate on the basis of a transparent bulk electricity&#13;
tariff (also called the internal settlement price for EPH power supply&#13;
bureaus). The intention is facilitate true profit-center and commercial&#13;
operation at the distribution level.&#13;
E. Sector Restructuring&#13;
25.   The objective of sector restructuring in Henan is to establish clear commercial&#13;
relationship between the core power sector operations of EPH and increase the efficiency of&#13;
generation and distribution operations. Sector restructuring will also introduce competition&#13;
in the procurement of new generation. The reformns to be implemented include:&#13;
(a)    Design and implementation of a competitive solicitation program  to&#13;
obtain power supply: The design of the competitive solicitation program&#13;
with all documentation will be completed by December 1995. Subject to&#13;
State Council approval this program will be implemented to procure at least&#13;
one generation project by the end-of 1998.&#13;
(b)   EPH will restructure the generation company (with seven state-owned&#13;
power plants), and the power development company as profit-centers by&#13;
March 1997.  These entities will be incorporated as limited liability&#13;
companies in accordance with the Company Law following establishment as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -                      ANNEX 3.3&#13;
profit centers in March 1997, or availability of State Council guidelines&#13;
whichever is later.&#13;
(c)   Development of Model Commercial Contracts: EPH will develop model&#13;
contracts to define its commercial relationships with power sector&#13;
companies. The contracts include:&#13;
*     Power sales agreements between EPH transmission and generation&#13;
operations and EPH supply bureaus and independent supply bureaus.&#13;
*     Power  purchase  agreements  between  separate/independent&#13;
generators and EPH.&#13;
*     Operational and commercial agreement between Central China&#13;
Power Group Corporation/Administration and EPH.&#13;
These contracts will be developed by December 1996. These contracts will be made&#13;
effective by June 1997.&#13;

ANNEX 3.4: ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING AND&#13;
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
I. Background and Objectives&#13;
1.    Electric Power of Henan (EPH) is undertaking major changes to meet the&#13;
operational challenges of power sector reforms initiated by the Chinese Government.&#13;
One of the major objectives of these reforms is to establish a modem enterprise system&#13;
characterized by clear definition of property rights, autonomous management,&#13;
commercial orientation, financial independence, and separation of government ownership&#13;
and regulatory functions from enterprise management. The reforms are mainly based on:&#13;
(i) new accounting regulations, promulgated by the Ministry of Finance in July 1994, that&#13;
are generally consistent with International Accounting Standards, and, (ii) the improved&#13;
enterprise policy and governance framework defined by the Company Law enacted in&#13;
July 1994.&#13;
2.    To achieve these objectives, the Chinese Government and the World Bank jointly&#13;
developed an implementation program of sector reforms that stresses full corporatization&#13;
and greater autonomy and accountability of power enterprises.' The reform strategy is&#13;
intended to improve the operational efficiency and increase the market orientation of the&#13;
power sector.&#13;
3.    Like most state-owned enterprises, EPH is faced with the following problems:&#13;
(i) government interference in management, administrative and operational decisions&#13;
reflecting the former central planning orientation of the economy; (ii) lack of full&#13;
accountability of managers stemming from an inadequate, highly centralized decision&#13;
making and non availability of timely and accurate financial information at different&#13;
operational activity levels; (iii) lack of transparency of the financial situation: financial&#13;
statements that are now prepared based on the new accounting regulations, still do not&#13;
provide full disclosure of EPH's financial position and, (iv) lack of focus on the core&#13;
business operations and involvement in many side activities that include profitable&#13;
activities such as construction companies, design/engineering institutes, as well as&#13;
welfare responsibilities such as housing, schools, hospitals etc.&#13;
China Power Sector Reform: Toward Competition and Improved Performance, Report No. 12929-CHA,&#13;
Document of the World Bank, September 15, 1994.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-84 -                       ANNEX 3.4&#13;
4.    This technical assistance activity is financed through the Henan (Qinbei) thermal&#13;
power project and is designed to address the above mentioned organizational and&#13;
financial issues and problems. It stresses the strengthening of internal organizational and&#13;
management practices, and the introduction of appropriate accounting, budgeting and&#13;
financial management systems. To achieve the full benefits of organizational reform and&#13;
improved financial reporting and monitoring systems, it is proposed to carry out the&#13;
project in three distinct but fully integrated phases:&#13;
(a)   a comprehensive diagnostic review of the current organizational structure,&#13;
management practices, and financial/accounting practices and reporting&#13;
systems, with particular attention to division of responsibilities, flow of&#13;
information and quality of reporting, and budgeting and accounting&#13;
systems and procedures.&#13;
(b)   development of an improved organizational structure, design of the&#13;
required accounting and financial and budgeting systems to meet the need&#13;
of efficient management and decentralized decision making, and&#13;
preparation of a detailed plan for implementation.&#13;
(c)   implementation of the organizational structure and systems approved by&#13;
EPH including computer, software and training needs.&#13;
5.    This work to be undertaken is closely related to the implementation of various&#13;
institutional reforms in EPH/Henan's power system. It will be extremely important to&#13;
coordinate the tasks under this activity with the overall reform effort in EPH.&#13;
Coordination with legal advisors hired by EPH for reform implementation will be crucial.&#13;
The Reform Implementation Plan and the Termns of Reference for Legal Consulting&#13;
Services are attached (Attachment 1 and 2, respectively).&#13;
II. Scope of Work&#13;
6.    The project will include, but not necessarily limited to, the following tasks:&#13;
Phase 1: Diagnostic Review and Analysis&#13;
7.    During the first phase, the consultants are required to carry out a detailed&#13;
assessment of the current organizational structure and financial management practices in&#13;
EPH. The preliminary work done by EPH consultants in November 1994, may be used&#13;
as a background document. The scope of this review will include:&#13;
(a)   A review and assessment of EPH's internal organization and operating and&#13;
administrative procedures with particular attention to the responsibilities&#13;
of the existing business units or subunits (such as, generation plants,&#13;
prefecture supply bureaus, county/city supply bureaus, construction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-85 -                      ANNEX 3.4&#13;
companies, etc.) and their functional relations, overlap in lines of&#13;
responsibility, excessive centralization of decision-making, and&#13;
organizational deficiencies.&#13;
(b)   Review and analysis of accounting procedures, documentation, reporting&#13;
formats and the nature of financial transactions between the various&#13;
departments, power generation and supply entities, and service&#13;
subsidiaries.&#13;
(c)   Critical assessment of Cost Accounting, Financial Planning, Budgeting,&#13;
and Internal Audit systems and procedures. Special attention will be given&#13;
to the existing organization of accounting units and reporting&#13;
requirements.&#13;
(d)   Evaluation  of performance  monitoring  systems: establishment of&#13;
performance targets and indicators, methods for communicating,&#13;
controlling and monitoring them.&#13;
Phase 2: Master plan for Internal Reorganization and Financial Management Systems&#13;
8.    During the second phase, the consultants will, jointly with EPH, develop an&#13;
organizational structure and related management, accounting, financial, control and&#13;
reporting systems that address the deficiencies and weaknesses identified during the first&#13;
phase, satisfy EPH's long-term corporate objectives and increase its cost consciousness&#13;
and business orientation. The work of this phase is organized in three subactivities:&#13;
Organizational and Management Structure&#13;
9.    Redefinition of the functional boundaries and responsibilities of the different&#13;
departments, work units and subsidiaries. Special attention should be given EPH's main&#13;
functions (e.g. generation, transmission, distribution and customer management) and&#13;
financial operations at the headquarters and operational unit levels. The recommended&#13;
organization should also prepare EPH to its role of major player in a more competitive&#13;
power sector by assessing the need for an autonomous unit responsible for planning and&#13;
competitive procurement of supply.&#13;
10.   Definition of interorganizational relationships, communication and reporting&#13;
channels between the different units.&#13;
11.   Assistance in the preparation of an Operational Manual that describes the&#13;
organizational structure, functional boundaries, job descriptions, communication and&#13;
reporting channels, limits of authority, etc.  Special attention should be given to&#13;
accounting and financial units.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86-                      ANNEX 3.4&#13;
12.   Recommendation of optimal staffing and preparation of job description and&#13;
qualification requirements for all posts of reasonable importance in the recommended&#13;
organizational structure.&#13;
Accounting Systems and Practices&#13;
13.   Redefinition of accounting units and activities clearly identifying cost and profit&#13;
centers, reporting requirements, formats for information flow and frequency of&#13;
information exchange. This task will develop a basic design for the new financial and&#13;
accounting information system. It is of crucial importance that this basic design of the&#13;
financial and accounting management information system be totally consistent with the&#13;
proposed reorganization of business processes and procedures.&#13;
14.   Development of a Standard Financial Accounting System and general accounts&#13;
classification detailing balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. This&#13;
should include policies and system procedures, recommended principles for accounting&#13;
classification, and follow-up methods. The system should develop and provide for the&#13;
timely collection of accounts receivable and settlement of accounts payable. It should&#13;
also contain standards for depreciation for fixed asset accounting.&#13;
15.   Assistance in the preparation of an Accounting Manual setting forth a coded chart&#13;
of accounts, detailing and describing balance sheet accounts, income accounts, functional&#13;
and department accounts, cost/profit centers, objective accounts, policies, standard&#13;
procedure instructions, report formats (including an inventory of reports describing their&#13;
purpose and method of preparation, assigning responsibilities for preparation, timetable,&#13;
frequency and distribution lists), use of capital and expense budget programs (including&#13;
guidelines distinguishing capital items and items charges directly to expense).&#13;
16.   Improvement of the Internal Control and Audit System through approval and audit&#13;
procedures, internal review systems-especially for purchasing, inventory and stores,&#13;
handling of cash, and payroll.&#13;
Budgeting and Performance-Based Management Information Systems&#13;
17.   Redefinition of the process of setting performance targets, and the systems for&#13;
controlling and monitoring them in practice. This would include policies and procedures,&#13;
related analytical techniques, and mechanical tools to ensure project planning,&#13;
formulation, justification, management and control of budgets, including analysis of&#13;
budget variances.&#13;
18.   Procedures to integrate MIS with the cost accounting system so that it can&#13;
generate information for assigning responsibility, measure labor and input productivity&#13;
against standards, analyze and control cost variances (i.e. input and labor price and&#13;
quantity, efficiency, overheads, and capacity variances) from standards. This should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-87 -                     ANNEX3.4&#13;
facilitate the determination of the level of profitability of EPH so that pricing decisions&#13;
can be taken with the full knowledge of costs.&#13;
19.   Development of a Financial Planning system, including the introduction of&#13;
operational objectives and planned allocation of resources in the form of Operating&#13;
Expense Budgets and Capital Expenditure Budgets, and the frequency for issuance. The&#13;
budgeting system should be coordinated with the financial accounts in order to reconcile&#13;
budget variances with financial figures;&#13;
20.   Improvement of the planning and control of operational support functions or&#13;
central service functions, such as, maintenance and work planning/preparation, materials&#13;
management, procurement, quality control, transportation, personnel management, etc..&#13;
21.   The consultant will prepare a detailed scope of tasks and a clearly defined&#13;
implementation strategy for a smooth transition from the current organizational structure&#13;
to the recommended one and progressive replacement of existing systems by the newly&#13;
designed ones. The implementation strategy will be divided into actions and targets with&#13;
a timetable and should identify the priorities of and sequence in organizational change&#13;
and systems development.&#13;
Phase 3: Implementation&#13;
22.   During this phase, the consultant will assist EPH  in implementing the&#13;
recommended changes in organizational structure, business practices, financial&#13;
management and reporting systems. The work will include:&#13;
(a)   assistance in implementing the new  organizational structure and&#13;
organizing work sessions/seminars to help managers and financial/&#13;
accounting staff fully understand the proposed changes;&#13;
(b)   assistance in selecting and installing suitable hardware and software,&#13;
especially  a  new   general  ledger  package  and  appropriate&#13;
centralized/distributed computer systems to be linked to desk-top&#13;
terminals.&#13;
(c)   identification of staffing and skills required to implement the new&#13;
financial/accounting systems and appropriate in-house, external training&#13;
programs, and assistance in preparation of training manuals.&#13;
III. Approach, Reporting, Outputs and Time Schedule&#13;
23.   The international consultants will submit a proposal to cover all three phases of&#13;
the work. However, the proposal should delineate clearly the costs for each phase of the&#13;
work. The proposal will detail: (i) the proposed work plan, approach and organization of&#13;
the consultant's project team; (ii) the tasks to be undertaken by each member of the team,&#13;

ANNEX 3.5: LEGAL CONSULTING SERVICES&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
I. Background and Objectives&#13;
I.    The Electric Power of Henan (EPH), a government-owned power company, is&#13;
seeking a loan from the World Bank to finance the Qinbei Thermal Power Plant. It is&#13;
proposed to include in the proposed loan, funds for financing the cost of legal technical&#13;
training and consulting services to support enterprise and regulatory Teform.&#13;
2.    EPH  has adopted a "Reform  Implementation Plan" which includes: the&#13;
corporatization of EPH and its subsidiary power related activities; the separation of&#13;
government bureau functions (i.e. regulatory functions) from enterprise ownership and&#13;
management; and, the restructuring of the provincial power sector with clear cost&#13;
separation of core generation and distribution to increase efficiency and pave the way for&#13;
eventual separation through divestment. EPH has already used an international legal&#13;
advisor in the preparation of the Reform Implementation Plan.&#13;
3.    To implement these reforms EPH will require legal technical assistance to: create&#13;
corporate legal instruments; establish internal rules and regulations; and, develop and&#13;
execute a variety of commercial contracts. In addition, the expected creation of a new&#13;
legal and regulatory framework for the power sector in China and increased commercial&#13;
orientation of EPH will require EPH to development internal legal expertise sufficient to&#13;
support its commercial and financial activities within this new framework.&#13;
4.    This Terms of Reference for legal consulting services is designed to provide EPH&#13;
with the required legal assistance on a timely basis. The timing for certain aspects in the&#13;
scope of work are contingent upon specific government actions, consequently, the legal&#13;
consulting services will be provided when required by EPH to meet the schedules&#13;
established in the Reform Implementation Plan.&#13;
5.    A parallel technical assistance activity will focus on organizational restructuring&#13;
and financial management procedures. Outputs of this work, particularly the definition of&#13;
internal functional boundaries and business units, will be an important input to some of&#13;
the legal technical assistance. The Legal Consultant will be kept informed on the&#13;
progress of this work. It will be important for the Legal Consultant to ensure that the&#13;
legal advise is consistent with the organizational restructuring being undertaken by EPH.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-90 -                       ANNEX 3.5&#13;
II. Scope of Work&#13;
6.    The legal Consultant will undertake to deliver the specific legal tasks identified&#13;
below, as well as legal training and briefings as required in order to keep the client (i.e.&#13;
EPH) fully informed of the implications of the recommended actions. This legal training&#13;
can be conducted through informal lectures and seminars and will assist in the&#13;
development of in-house EPH legal capability.&#13;
7.    Incorporation of EPH as a Limited Liability Company.  Preparation of&#13;
Articles of Association and all statutory documentation required to incorporate EPH as a&#13;
Limited Liability Company as per Company Law in China. A draft Articles of&#13;
Association prepared by EPH will form the initial basis of this work. The process of&#13;
incorporation will be formally initiated when the State Council issues the regulations on&#13;
the restructuring of state-owned enterprises as Companies. The Legal Consultant will&#13;
assist EPH in all procedural matters required by the Company Registry and other&#13;
statutory agencies in China. A key task for the Legal Consultant will be to ensure that the&#13;
capital restructuring issues in the Articles of Association which relate to the clarification&#13;
of ownership are consistent with the implementing regulations to be issued by the State&#13;
Council. In addition, advise will be provided in responding to questions raised and&#13;
clarifications requested by statutory agencies involved in the process of incorporation.&#13;
8.    The assistance provided for incorporation as a limited liability company will in&#13;
also focus on the development of suitable procedures and guidelines to facilitate&#13;
operation under the new structure. This will include: corporate charters; by-laws and&#13;
internal administrative procedures/regulations consistent with the new corporate form.&#13;
The internal procedures should focus on the development of clear profit and cost centers&#13;
that will ease subsequent stages of restructuring envisaged i.e. separation of generation&#13;
company and creation of distribution profit-centers.&#13;
9.    Consolidation of Government Functions within EPH  and subsequent&#13;
Separation. As a first step towards the separation of government (i.e. power bureau)&#13;
functions from EPH, it is proposed that a single department be responsible for all these&#13;
activities. This plan will be developed by EPH with assistance provided through&#13;
organizational restructuring study. The Legal Consultant will assist EPH in developing&#13;
the necessary internal guidelines to facilitate this organizational change. Coordination&#13;
with the Consultant responsible for the organizational restructuring study will be&#13;
required.&#13;
10.   Once the Government clearly defines the procedures for implementing new power&#13;
sector regulation arrangements, the Legal Consultant will assist EPH in transferring the&#13;
bureau functions to the entities specified in the government implementation regulations.&#13;
11.   Commercialization of Noncore Activities of EPH. EPH has undertaken to&#13;
delineate their noncore activities into three categories:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-91-                       ANNEX 3.5&#13;
Category A: Activities that are currently accounted for separately and&#13;
which have the potential to be separated as independent companies.&#13;
Category B: Commercial activities that are can be operated as profit-&#13;
centers&#13;
Category C: Welfare activities that can be established as cost-centers.&#13;
EPH will separate Category A activities into wholly-owned limited liability companies as&#13;
a first step. The Legal Consultant will advise on all relevant legal and procedural aspects&#13;
of this task. In addition, advise will be provided on the internal procedures and&#13;
guidelines to facilitate the operation of Category B activities as profit-centers and&#13;
Category C activities as cost-centers.&#13;
12.   Design of Competitive Bidding Program for Acquiring New Generation. The&#13;
legal consultant will assist EPH in designing comprehensive documentation and&#13;
procedures to acquire new generation resources. This task will include: Request for&#13;
Proposals (RFP) documentation; model power purchase contracts; implementation&#13;
agreements; etc. These documents will be designed based on the power system&#13;
parameters of EPH. This task will be completed by June 1996.&#13;
13.   Development of Model Commercial Contracts. Three types of commercial&#13;
contractual arrangements will need to be developed to assist EPH in dealing with&#13;
independent companies engaged in generation and distribution, as well as formalizing its&#13;
relationship with the Central China Power Group Corporation. These commercial&#13;
contracts are:&#13;
(a)   power sales and operating agreements between EPH and its affiliated and&#13;
nonaffiliated power supply bureaus (i.e. distribution entities);&#13;
(b)   power purchase and operating agreements between EPH and separate&#13;
generation entities; and&#13;
(c)   commercial and operating agreement between EPH and the Central China&#13;
Power Group Corporation.&#13;
14.   The commercial arrangements (a) and (b) should be based on the principle of&#13;
treating entities affiliated to EPH and those which are independent on an equal,&#13;
nondiscriminatory basis. The intention is that these commercial arrangements form the&#13;
basis of any restructuring undertaken in the power sector in Henan.&#13;
15.   As such commercial contractual arrangements are relatively new in China, the&#13;
Legal Consultant must provide all the required training to EPH staff on how to negotiate&#13;
and execute these contracts. This task will be completed by December 1996. The Legal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -                    ANNEX 3.5&#13;
Consultant will assist in implementing and making these contracts effective by June&#13;
1997.&#13;
16.  Incorporation of Generation Company and Power Development Company.&#13;
The seven state-owned plants within EPH will be consolidated and incorporated as a&#13;
limited liability company wholly-owned by EPH. The Legal Consultant will assist in the&#13;
incorporation process, as well as provide advise on the actual implementation of the&#13;
commercial contract between generation entities and EPH (see task 5 above). A similar&#13;
incorporation process will be adopted for the Power Development Company.&#13;
17.   Development of Electricity Conservation Performance Contracts. EPH plans&#13;
to establish and independent profit-center to pursue electricity conservation activities and&#13;
programs. Some of these activities will be conducted on the basis of "performance&#13;
contracts" between the conservation profit-center and the client. In addition, some&#13;
activities would require commercial contracts to specify financing terms and associated&#13;
services. The Legal Consultant will provide the advise required by EPH on the&#13;
development of these contracts. This tentative schedule for this task is June 1996.&#13;
III. Organization of Work and Consultant Qualifications&#13;
18.   The Legal Consultant will be a reputed international law firm. The Consultant&#13;
will be selected by EPH (i.e. the Client) with the assistance of the World Bank. The&#13;
following criteria will guide the selection of the Legal Consultant:&#13;
(a)   Demonstrated experience in providing corporate, commercial, financial&#13;
and regulatory legal services to electric utilities, including representation&#13;
of utilities in their acquisition of power from independent power&#13;
producers;&#13;
(b)   Direct experience in advising Chinese and foreign clients on the&#13;
application of the Chinese Company Law. Experience in assisting entities&#13;
to incorporate as limited liability companies in China would be a distinct&#13;
advantage; and&#13;
(c)   A law firm which has a strong Asian presence, and a legal staff with&#13;
Chinese language ability will be favorably considered.  Previous&#13;
experience in advising power sector entities in China would be an&#13;
advantage.&#13;
The Legal Consultant will need to clearly specify the legal staff who will be made&#13;
available for each of the above tasks. The Client reserves the right to reject any legal&#13;
staff who substitute the individuals specified at the time of selection. The Legal&#13;
Consultant will be selected by end-July 1995.&#13;

ANNEX 3.6: TARIFF STRUCTURE&#13;
CONSULTING SERVICES&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
I. Background and Objectives&#13;
1.    The principal objective of this study is to assist Electric Power of Henan (EPH) in&#13;
developing a tariff structure and feasible transition plan that will reflect the following&#13;
principles:&#13;
(a)   full adoption of a unified electricity tariff in Henan based on financially&#13;
sufficient long-run marginal cost principles;&#13;
(b)   a rational capacity charge for industrial and large consumers;&#13;
(c)   a time-of-day tariff system that is feasible; and&#13;
(d)   a nondiscriminatory bulk sale power tariff for power sold to power supply&#13;
bureaus.&#13;
2.    Electric Power of Henan (EPH) has with the assistance of Beijing Economic&#13;
Research Institute (BERI) prepared a tariff study which will forn the basis for this&#13;
technical assistance. This tariff study (Attachment I) represents an excellent analytic&#13;
exercise towards achieving the above objectives. The Consultant will work with EPH&#13;
and related agencies in assessing the assumptions, computations and recommendations in&#13;
the tariff study. Additionally, the Consultant will provide the necessary training to ensure&#13;
that EPH develops adequate in-house capacity to undertake future tariff reviews and&#13;
revisions.&#13;
II. Scope of Work&#13;
3 .    The Consultant will perform the specific tasks identified below:&#13;
(a)   Review the computations performed to arrive at the Long-Run Marginal&#13;
Cost (LRMC) tariff in the tariff study conducted by EPH. The Consultant&#13;
will:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -                      ANNEX 3.6&#13;
(i)   examine the appropriateness of the economic assumptions made;&#13;
(ii)   review the load forecasts and surveys conducted;&#13;
(iii)   review system expansion plan and operating policies; and&#13;
(iv)    review the basis for selecting time-of-day tariff intervals selected.&#13;
(b)   Examine the rate structure developed in the tariff study and suggest&#13;
suitable modifications if necessary.  The Consultant will compare the&#13;
proposed tariff structure with different alternatives, and clearly explain the&#13;
advantages and disadvantages of each approach.  In making these&#13;
comparisons it will be important to stress the practical aspects of tariff&#13;
administration in addition to the economic efficiency of a given tariff&#13;
structure.&#13;
(c)    Assist EPH  in designing and selecting a suitable rate structure and&#13;
defining a workable tariff reform implementation plan. The purpose of the&#13;
tariff reform implementation plan is to achieve a suitable transition to&#13;
LRMC pricing. As EPH intends to make a gradual transition to a&#13;
corporate entity operating on commercial principles, the Consultant will:&#13;
(i)   analyze the financial cost and revenues associated with the rate&#13;
structure to ensure that the commercial financial targets can be&#13;
achieved by EPH; and&#13;
(ii)   ensure consistency with the new direct and in-direct taxation policy&#13;
in China, as well as the financial accounting standards established.&#13;
(d)   Develop a suitable nondiscriminatory bulk electricity transfer price (also&#13;
called the internal settlement price for EPH-affiliated power supply&#13;
bureaus).  It is important that the method of establishing the bulk&#13;
electricity transfer price ensures equal treatment of a the 13 EPH-affiliated&#13;
and 4 independent power supply bureaus.&#13;
III. Organization of Work&#13;
4.    This technical assistance activity will be managed by EPH with the assistance of&#13;
the World Bank. The Consultant selected must demonstrate prior expertise in developing&#13;
electricity utility rate structures. Experience in advising electric utilities and regulatory&#13;
agencies in developing countries will considered favorably.&#13;
5.    It is envisaged that two experienced professional will form the core Consultant&#13;
Team. About 10 weeks of work will be required by each professional, of which 7 will be&#13;
in the field. Two trips each to China are planned.&#13;

ANNEX 3.9: POWER PRICING IN HENAN PROVINCE&#13;
1.    Power Pricing in Henan Province, as other part in China, underwent major evolution&#13;
during the past years. As the economy moved to freer markets, a multitier pricing system&#13;
has been introduced in 1985 based on:&#13;
(a)    "in-plan quotas", electricity provided by power plants owned by the state,&#13;
priced at a state base price fixed by SPC and MOEP;&#13;
(b)    out of plan quotas", electricity provided by most plants built after 1985 and&#13;
financed mostly by provincial and local governments, parapublic&#13;
independent producers (Huaneng and Sunburst Power Company,&#13;
essentially) and eventually joint-ventures, priced at a collected fund price&#13;
approved on a yearly basis by the provincial government;'&#13;
In Henan, in 1994, about 57 percent of the total electricity sales were priced at the "State-&#13;
base price", 43 percent of the sales were priced at the "collected fund price".&#13;
State Base Price&#13;
2.     The state base prices, also referred as the catalog prices, used to be artificially low at&#13;
about 6.54 fen/kWh until 1985, were gradually increased to reflect coal and transport price&#13;
increases. In 1993, they were fully revised throughout China and substantially increased.&#13;
Demand charges have been increased by about 50 percent and energy prices by about 40&#13;
percent. The new system will thereafter be adjusted annually by SPC and MOEP to reflect&#13;
charges in supply costs, specially fuel prices.&#13;
3.     State prices in Henan increased from an average of 10.6 fen/kWh in 1992 to an&#13;
average of about 14.4 fen/kWh in 1993 and about 18.92 fen/kWh, in 1994. State base&#13;
prices for Henan in 1994 are provided in Table 1.&#13;
The Collected Fund Price&#13;
4.     The "collected fund price", also referred to as guided prices, is based on the "new&#13;
plant-new price" policy introduced by the Government in 1986. Under this policy, power&#13;
Unlike in other provinces such as Zhejiang: Henan doesn't have "above quota" or "processed" electricity, purchased&#13;
from other provinces or captive plants and/or by all power plants after meeting their planed generation targets. The&#13;
"above quota" electricity price in Henan province, are about 40 percent higher than the "catalog price".&#13;

from "new plants" is sold to provincial company at "debt-repayment prices". Calculated&#13;
and paid on a plant-by-plant basis, the debt-repayment prices are designed to provide&#13;
sufficient revenue for the "repayment of loan capital with interest", generally within ten&#13;
years. The collected fund price in Henan was 25.2 fen/kWh in 1994.&#13;

Fees and Surcharges&#13;
5.     Additional fees and surcharges are added to the prices paid by the consumers. With&#13;
the exception of the 0.4 fen/kWh levy on all consumers throughout the country to help&#13;
finance the Three Gorges Hydroelectric Project, these charges are levied by provincial and&#13;
local governments. In Henan, industrial and commercial electricity sales are subject to both&#13;
a 2.0 fen/kWh surcharge for a Provincial Power Construction Fund (as in other provinces)&#13;
and a surcharge rate of 8 to 10 percent over total consumption for Local Construction Funds&#13;
operated by prefectural governments. Some additional fees are earmarked in some areas to&#13;
partially cover part of local distribution and transmission costs or street lighting. The bulk&#13;
of the revenue collected through these additional fees are managed by the "three electricity&#13;
bureau" (supply, security, conservation), controlled by local governments at different levels.&#13;

quotas of about 3000 GWh, about 60 percent of the total electricity consumption in 1993&#13;
estimated at 5,400 GWh; they are charged at tariffs of 18.8 to 19.8 fen/kWh for in-plan&#13;
compared with 30.5 fen/kWh paid by similar consumers without quotas, except agriculture&#13;
and fertilizer customers who enjoy a tariff at a subsidized level: 14 fen/kWh and 18.4&#13;
fen/kWh respectively. The fertilizer factories consumed about 6 GWh in 1993, 1.1 percent&#13;
of the total consumption.&#13;

All these prices are much lower than the long-run average incremental cost of supply of the&#13;
provincial system estimated at about 39 fen/kWh at the 35 kV level and LRMC of 43 at&#13;
10 kV level.(Beijing Economic Research Institute of Water Resources and Electric Power:&#13;
The Economic Analysis Report for Qinbei, November, 1994 and Henan Power Grid Tariff&#13;
Study, October, 1994).&#13;
Consumer Price Reform&#13;
9.    Henan provincial government has attached great importance to tariff reform. The&#13;
government has promised to raise the average tariff to a level equivalent to US$0.6 by the&#13;
year 2000. EPH has gradually raised the final consumer prices to reflect the real cost of the&#13;
resources. The consolidated tariff has been increased from 6.54 fen/kWh in 1985 to 21.6&#13;
fen/kWh in 1994. EPH has also introduced incentives to improve efficiency specially by&#13;
introducing time-of-the-day tariffs and reducing economically unjustified discrimination&#13;
among customers. In Luoyang and Zhengzhou prefectures a time-of-the-day tariff was&#13;
introduced on an experimental basis. The difference between peak tariff and off-peak tariff&#13;
is 5:1. Starting from 1996, EPH will prepare a time-of-the-day tariff to large consumers&#13;
with a four year schedule expanding from 400 large industrial consumers in 9 prefectures to&#13;
the full availability of TOD tariff choice to all consumers in the province. EPH will also&#13;
introduce a new tariff for commercial consumers.&#13;
10.   EPH is committed to increase the pace of the tariff reforn in the province based on&#13;
its past successes and leading experiences in other areas in China. EPH will gradually&#13;
increase capacity charge to large consumers starting from 1996. It is specially committed to&#13;
the abolition of the two track system and unification of bulk sale tariffs and final consumer&#13;
tariffs and avoid discrimination among customers based on "in-plan" and "out-of-plan"&#13;
quotas. EPH will adopt a unified sales tariff by the end of 1998. EPH will prepare with the&#13;
assistance of foreign consultants an tariff implementation plan that ensures smooth&#13;
transition from the existing dual-track pricing system to a tariff system based on long-run&#13;
marginal cost pricing principles. This study will be initiated in August 1995 and the&#13;
preliminary tariff system presented to the World Bank for comments by March 15, 1996.&#13;
The revised tariff system which takes into account the comments and suggestions of the&#13;
World Bank will be proposed for Central and Provincial authorities for approval and&#13;
finalized before June 30, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102-                       ANNEX3.9&#13;
11.   By the year 2000, EPH will have finally rationalized the tariff structure, giving&#13;
consumers a choice of a flat tariff or time-of-the-day tariff, and raised the tariff level not&#13;
much lower than the LRMC level of 42.5 fen.&#13;

ANNEX 4.1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
General&#13;
1.    The proposed Henan (Qinbei) thermal power plant is located at Wulongkou town,&#13;
17 km northeast of Jiyuan City and about 140 km northwest of Zhengzhou City, Henan&#13;
Province. The north of the plant site faces Taihangshan Mountains and the south is close&#13;
to the Qinbei Railway Station where Jiaozuo-Zhicheng railway passes through. The&#13;
topography of the plant site is flat and open. Most of the land is too poor to be farmed&#13;
without resettlement, the relief is higher with a slope of 3-4 percent and the plant will be&#13;
leveled above the 100-year flood line. The seismic intensity scale is 6 degree. In its first&#13;
phase, the plant will have an installed capacity of 1,200 MW (2 x 600 MW units) of&#13;
ultimate capacity of 3,600 MW (6 x 600 MW). The scheduled dates of commercial&#13;
operation of the two units are as follows:&#13;
Unit 1    -    March 2001&#13;
Unit 2    -    December 2001&#13;
Coal&#13;
2.    Basic design parameters for the boilers and turbine generators will follow the&#13;
standard specifications of 600 MW coal-fired subcritical units of proven technology. The&#13;
power plant will consume up to 3.5 million tons of mixed coal a year. Coal produced at&#13;
Linfen, Houzhou and Changzhi coal mines in the southern region of Shanxi Province will&#13;
be transported to the coal yard of the power plant directly by train. The coal transporting&#13;
distance is 150-270 km from these coal mines to the power plant. The units will be&#13;
designed to bum design coal (mixture of lean coal/bituminous coal/washed middlings of&#13;
2:1:1 ratio; 21297 kJ/kg LHV; Ash 24.95 percent; Sulfur 0.41 percent; volatile matter 15.40&#13;
percent) and check coal (mixture of lean coal/bituminous coal/washed middlings of 2:0:1&#13;
ratio; 22083 kJ/kg; Ash 25.27 percent; sulfur 0.56 percent; volatile matter 12.95 percent).&#13;
The supply and transportation of the fuel coal have been approved by the related authorities.&#13;
Cooling Water System&#13;
3.    The north of the plant site is facing Taihangshan Mountains and sufficient quantity&#13;
of ground water is available to meet the water demand of the plant for the makeup and&#13;
cooling requirements for the plant. For the circulating water system, the closed circulating&#13;
system will be adopted. The makeup water required by the plant will be supplied from the&#13;
underground water of the Qin River alluvial plain. Each unit will be equipped with one&#13;
cooling tower and three circulating water pumps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-104 -                     ANNEX 4.1&#13;
Transmission Lines and Associated Substations&#13;
4.    Two 500 kV transmission lines, 165 km each, will be constructed to connect the&#13;
Qinbei power plant and Xiao-Liu substation, which is one of the existing substations in the&#13;
Henan Power Grid. In Xiao-Liu substation, one 750 MVA step-down transformer will be&#13;
installed. The existing 500 kV transmission line between Xiaoliu-Yaomeng-Shuanghe&#13;
connect the Xiao-Liu substation and Nanyang substation. In the Nanyang substation, one&#13;
750 MVA step-down transformer will be installed.&#13;
Turbine and Generator&#13;
5.    Turbines will have the nominal rated output of 600 MW with steam pressure of 16.7&#13;
MPa at high-pressure turbine inlet and superheat and reheat temperature of 538 degree C.&#13;
each unit will be equipped with one high-pressure turbine bypass system and one low-&#13;
pressure turbine bypass system.&#13;
6.    Turbine generator units will have a nominal capacity of 600 MW each. The voltage&#13;
of the generators is 22 KV and the cooling mode is of water-hydrogen-hydrogen type.&#13;
Steam Generator&#13;
7.    The stream generators will be of the subcritical, single reheat, dry bottom ash,&#13;
balanced draft, semioutdoor, drum type, each rated to MCR of 2020 T/h, steam pressure of&#13;
18.18 MPa and steam temperature of 541 degree C at superheater and reheater outlets. For&#13;
pulverized coal system, the double inlet and double outlet ball mill, directly firing system or&#13;
directly firing medium speed mill system will be adopted. Each unit will be equipped with&#13;
two forced draft fans, two primary air fans and two induced draft fans. The four-field&#13;
electrostatic precipitator with 99.6 percent efficiency will be adopted. Two boilers will&#13;
share one common chimney with a height of 240 m. For air pollution mitigation, the units&#13;
will be designed to provide low NO, burners and other low NO, technology and provide&#13;
space for future provision of the flue gas desulfurization plant.&#13;
Ash Handling System&#13;
8.    The power plant (2x600 MW) will produce 19.97 T/H slag and 113.167 T/H ash,&#13;
and about 0.87 million tons of ash and slag each year. The slag from the bottom of boilers&#13;
will be conveyed hydraulically to the dewatering bin. The dewatered slag will be delivered&#13;
to the ash yard by trucks. The fine ash from the electrostatic precipitators and the bottom of&#13;
economizers of the two units will be conveyed pneumatically to dry ash silo where the dry&#13;
ash will be added with water to the moisture of about 25 percent so as to avoid the ash&#13;
flying and easy to be rolled and piled in the ash yard. The ash yard is situated on the flood&#13;
land of Qin River, 4.5 km away from the plant site. The ash yard will be provided to meet&#13;
the ash and slag disposal from 6x600 MW units, for 17 years operation.&#13;

ANNEX 4.2: ELECTRICITY CONSERVATION&#13;
PROJECT COMPONENT&#13;
A. Electricity Conservation Programs in Henan Province&#13;
I.    Electricity conservation programs in Henan are part of an integrated planning&#13;
process conducted at the provincial, prefectural and county levels based on new&#13;
national/provincial electricity conservation policies and administrative programs. They&#13;
are implemented through the "three electricity office" of Henan province.  Three&#13;
electricity offices are government entities charged with the implementation and&#13;
monitoring of conservation programs. This includes participation in and supervision of&#13;
conservation programs, providing advice to enterprises, disseminating good practice and&#13;
monitoring targets. Three electricity offices are found at all levels of government within&#13;
a province, with the provincial power entity being the effective umbrella organization.&#13;
They are called three electricity offices because their responsibilities include planning and&#13;
safety, in addition to energy conservation.&#13;
2.    Cumulative electrical energy savings in Henan province for the period from 1980&#13;
to 1989 were approximately 6,800 GWh/year, of which 5,000 GWh resulted from&#13;
structural changes in industry and 1,800 GWh/year were technical savings. These&#13;
savings have been achieved through the implementation of energy efficiency codes and&#13;
standards with other agencies. The standards are implemented through a variety of&#13;
programs, the most notable of which are:&#13;
(a)   Renovation of Enterprise Technologies: This program has been carried&#13;
out since 1981. It consists of renovation or replacement of electricity-&#13;
inefficient technologies and equipment with measures such as high-&#13;
frequency electric furnaces, variable-speed motors, etc.. More than 40,000&#13;
equipment units have been renovated and more than 115,000 new units&#13;
installed. Total savings of the measures are 1,260 GWh/year.&#13;
(b)   Renovation of Enterprise Transformers: This programs is part of a&#13;
comprehensive provincial and EPH plan to decrease losses in enterprise&#13;
owned and maintained transformers.&#13;
(c)   Efficient Lighting Program: Henan province and EPH aggressively&#13;
promote this program for the replacement of standard lighting&#13;
technologies and compact fluorescent bulbs, fluorescent tubes, high&#13;
intensity discharge lamps, and high pressure sodium lamps in enterprises.&#13;
(Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan, is perhaps the only Chinese city where a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-107-                       ANNEX4.2&#13;
large number of shopping centers, hotels and commercial establishments&#13;
use CFLs and other modem lighting technologies extensively).&#13;
3.    The main electricity conservation activities conducted by EPH include: to sustain&#13;
these efforts the Henan Provincial Government established a fund for cofinancing&#13;
investments in energy efficiency technologies made by enterprises. This Conservation&#13;
Investment Program, began as a pilot program in early 1994. The pilot began with a fund&#13;
corpus of Yuan 50 million-28 million came from the provincial government and 22&#13;
million from EPH. Savings of approximately 240 GWh/year have been obtained for a&#13;
total investment of 76 million Yuan (i.e. EPH 15 plus Customer 61) in 117 projects with&#13;
76 enterprises. The basic features of the fund are as follows:&#13;
(a)   EPH cofinancing takes the forrn of loans to industrial customers, with the&#13;
criterion that the customer make up the bulk of the capital required. The average&#13;
contribution from EPH has been about 20 percent.&#13;
(b)   Repayments are made by the customer directly into an EPH account. (The&#13;
potentially easier method of direct bill collection is not used as it could be&#13;
interpreted as a tariff for which EPH has no authority to set.)&#13;
(c)    EPH expects to recover its investment within six months to two years for&#13;
typical projects.&#13;
(d)   The interest rate on the loan is below market rates and therefore represents&#13;
a subsidy.&#13;
B. Electricity Conservation Component&#13;
Project Selection and Implementation Principles&#13;
4.    The principal objective of the $10 million electricity conservation component&#13;
under the proposed loan is to complement ongoing efforts by promoting market-based&#13;
sustainable programs. The sustainability of the projects will be ensured by: (a) the&#13;
economic and financial viability of the selected projects; (b) the full payment of the&#13;
project costs by the users; and (c) the verified and proper measurement of energy savings.&#13;
These projects will disseminate energy efficient technologies, demonstrate effective&#13;
measurement and monitoring practices, and demonstrate the viability of innovative&#13;
commercially-based contractual and financing mechanisms. The agreed principles for&#13;
project selection and implementation are:&#13;
(i)    Projects should be economicallly and financially viable with an&#13;
internal rate of return higher than for supply-side (i.e. generation)&#13;
projects.&#13;
(ii)    Pilot  projects  should  demonstrate  new   high-efficiency&#13;
technologies.  To successfully demonstrate and ensure wider&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-108 -                           ANNEX4.2&#13;
application of these technologies, EPH will ensure that: a) the&#13;
actual energy savings are measured and verified against planning&#13;
estimates; and b) the results are disseminated in Henan through&#13;
case-studies or information brochures.&#13;
(iii)    All projects undertaken jointly by EPH and electricity consumers&#13;
will be based on commercial terms with appropriate contractual&#13;
relationships.&#13;
(iv)    Pilot projects should demonstrate new  financing techniques for&#13;
energy conservation projects. These techniques include equipment&#13;
leasing and shared savings contracts.&#13;
Description of Conservation Projects&#13;
5.     The projects included under the electricity conservation project component, the&#13;
estimated energy savings, and the financial intemal rate for EPH are outlined in the&#13;
following table. The proposed energy conservation loan component of $10.00 million&#13;
equivalent comprises $6 million for conservation projects within EPH, $3.80 million for&#13;
projects with EPH clients, and about $200,000 for up-front implementation technical&#13;
assistance. This division of the energy conservation loan component between EPH&#13;
subsidiaries (approx. 60 percent) and EPH electricity consumers (approx. 40 percent)&#13;
reflects a balance desired by EPH to increase their confidence in guaranteeing the loan&#13;
repayment.&#13;

energy conservation projects. The project scope will include the procurement and&#13;
installation of state-of-art oxygen production equipment at one plant of the Louyang Steel&#13;
Company. EPH will finance the equipment and enter into a performance based contract&#13;
with Louyang Steel Company that links the repayment to energy savings and improved&#13;
productivity at the Luoyang Steel plant. A minimum payment will be established to&#13;
ensure recovery of the investment costs and also a reasonable profit. In addition, a shared&#13;
savings contract provision will enable Luoyang Steel Company to accelerate repayment&#13;
by utilizing the energy savings and productivity benefits that exceed the minimum debt&#13;
repayment. The contractual relationship will be based on commercial financing terms&#13;
applicable in China, plus a margin for services rendered and adminstrative expenses.&#13;
Technical assistance will be provided to develop the contractual arrangements and&#13;
repayment based on shared savings performance contracting terms.&#13;

consumer credit for the financing of energy efficient equipment in Henan. The project&#13;
scope will include the procurement and leasing of variable speed drives (VSDs). EPH&#13;
will procure the VSDs and lease them to consumers. The leasing terms will be&#13;
commercially based. The advantages of leasing as a means of financing energy efficient&#13;
equipment are: (a) increased credit security for EPH, as it will own the equipment until it&#13;
is transferred to the consumer (lessor) at the end of the leasing period. This mode of&#13;
leasing is referred to as a full-payout lease; and (b) provides consumers with 100 percent&#13;
upfront financing, thereby encouraging the adoption of the energy efficient equipment.&#13;
Technical assistance to prepare model contracts and procedures for lease financing of&#13;
energy efficient equipment has been included in the project.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
12.   The main implementation arrangements agreed upon are:&#13;
(a)   EPH will be responsible for the implementation of all energy conservation&#13;
projects included under the proposed loan.&#13;
(b)   All projects will include adequate provisions for the measurement and&#13;
verification of energy savings. The measurement of energy savings will&#13;
ensure that the performance of these pilot demonstration projects are&#13;
appropriately monitored to facilitate future dissemination of results and&#13;
project replicability. The measurement and monitoring protocols, as well&#13;
as the reporting requirements will be defined as part of the up-front&#13;
technical assistance for project implementation (item 6. in project list) and&#13;
agreed upon with the World Bank.&#13;
(c)   The  energy  conservation  projects  implemented  by  EPH  with&#13;
clients/consumers will be based on commercial terms. The direct cost of&#13;
funds for both on-lending in the case of Luoyang Steel (item 4. in project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-111I I -                  ANNEX4.2&#13;
list) and the VSD leasing program (item 5. in project list) will at a&#13;
minimum be the published state commercial bank rate for comparable loan&#13;
maturities, plus an administrative margin of 3 percent per year on&#13;
outstanding interest and principal.&#13;
(d)   All procurement will be done in accordance with World Bank procurement&#13;
guidelines. Technical specifications for all equipment procurement will be&#13;
reviewed by the World Bank. Disbursement of funds will be based on the&#13;
agreed schedule.&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
13.   To asure successful implementation, the proposed loan component includes&#13;
technical assistance in two elements: (a) a $400,000 component to support EPH's&#13;
distribution loss reduction demonstration project. These funds will be used for preparing&#13;
the basic engineering work required, as well as support the introduction of improved&#13;
distribution load management and planning techniques; and (b) a $200,000 component&#13;
for general support of project preparation and implementation. These funds will be used&#13;
mainly for the technical and contractual work required for the Luoyang Steel shared&#13;
savings program and VSD leasing program. These funds will also be used to develop&#13;
adequate monitoring and measurement protocols for all projects.&#13;
14.   A broader package of training and technical assistance initiatives are planned.&#13;
These initiatives cover both the business management aspects and technical aspects of a&#13;
commercially oriented electricity conservation program. Funding for these activities will&#13;
be proposed for financing from multilateral and bilateral technical assistance grant funds.&#13;
The following technical assistance initiatives are planned:&#13;
(a)   Commercial Business Planning and Management Module:  Topics&#13;
relating to financial analysis, project management, business planning will&#13;
be covered.&#13;
(b)   Energy Service Contracting:  Performance contracting for energy&#13;
services at a customer site will be crucial to mitigating performance risk to&#13;
levels where energy efficiency projects become viable. The introduction&#13;
of performance contracting as an integral part of in energy service&#13;
provision would address issues of project structure, marketing, and&#13;
building project linkages between customer, service providers and&#13;
financiers.&#13;
(c)   Energy monitoring and targeting (M&amp;T): M&amp;T is seen as a crucial&#13;
element of energy service provision. Without effective practices in M&amp;T&#13;
it is difficult to focus scarce resources on the highest yield efficiency&#13;
investments and it is also not possible to maintain performance at design&#13;
levels over the long-term.&#13;

ANNEX 4.8: LAND ACQUISITION AND RELOCATION&#13;
Scope of Relocation&#13;
1.    Qinbei Thennal Power Project includes construction of a new power plant and a&#13;
new 500-kV network consisting of about 165 kilometers (kin) of transmission lines, with&#13;
2 substations (1,500 MVA). The power plant is a greenfield operation located in a&#13;
semirural agricultural area of Jiyuan municipality in the northwestern part of Henan&#13;
province, about 17km to the northwest of Jiyuan City. The actual location of the plant is&#13;
an uninhabited wasteland area at the foot of Taihangshan and Wangwushan Mountains.&#13;
The topography of the plant site is flat and open. Most of the land is too poor to be&#13;
farmed. There is no resident on it, and no relocation necessary. There will be no adverse&#13;
social and economic impact through the loss of houses, agricultural land, grazing land or&#13;
other economic activity. According to the preliminary design there is no relocation&#13;
involved in the transmission component. However after considering the fact that the&#13;
construction of transmission will be implemented in 1997, EPH has budgeted for a&#13;
certain amount of land acquisition and possible relocation of households in case of&#13;
possible changes in the route of the transmission lines. Therefore, according to the&#13;
relocation plan, the project will acquire a total of 84.24 hectares (ha) of land, relocating at&#13;
most 30 to 40 households or 150 to 160 persons. In addition, as many as 358.4 ha of land&#13;
will be required temporarily during the project construction.&#13;

-133-                      ANNEX 4.8&#13;
Purpose and Strategy of Resettlement&#13;
2.    The priority was given to minimize the scope of resettlement throughout the&#13;
project design and planning. In order to achieve such an objective EPH spared no efforts&#13;
to minimize utilization of agriculture land and relocation of households and avoid mines,&#13;
historic, tourist and urban areas.&#13;
3.    There is no relocation of human beings in the preliminary planning. However, the&#13;
final routing of the lines have not been finalized yet, and the soil conditions or technical&#13;
constraints could have some changes. EPH estimated that relocation of a maximum of 30&#13;
to 40 households might be required if technical studies underway would require changes&#13;
in the routing of the lines. For those households who might be affected by the&#13;
construction of transmission lines, they will be compensated and supported to rebuild&#13;
their houses with better housing and living conditions within the same villages not far&#13;
from the existing site, averaging 100 to 200m to guarantee a smooth completion of the&#13;
construction.&#13;
4.    If a resettlement action plan would be required, it would be developed according&#13;
to Chinese policy and regulations and the Bank procedures, and in consultation with local&#13;
government regarding compensation standards and baseline surveys.&#13;
Legal Framework&#13;
5.    The Bank Requirements. The resettlement action plan (RAP) will be developed&#13;
in line with the requirements contained in the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.30:&#13;
Involuntary Resettlement.&#13;
6.    National and Local Policies.  The legal basis for land acquisition and&#13;
resettlement of Qinbei Power Project is provided by laws and regulations enacted by the&#13;
Central Government, and implementation regulations of provincial and local&#13;
municipalities. The main state law and regulations, the "Land Administration Law" was&#13;
enacted in 1986. The local implementation regulations include: "The Compensation&#13;
Standards for the land acquisition by the State," and "Henan Province Land&#13;
Administration Laws and Regulations" issued by Henan Provincial Government.(1989),&#13;
"Further Strengthening of Land Management in the Infrastructure Construction." jointed&#13;
issued by Henan Provincial Economic Planning Commission and Henan Provincial Land&#13;
Administration." (No. 111, 1991), and "The Decisions on the Compensation for the land&#13;
acquisition by the State" issued by Zhengzhou City and Prefecture Government (No. 144,&#13;
1993), and various related regulations or decrees adopted by local municipal or county&#13;
governments.&#13;
7.    Under this project, since most land acquisition and relocation will take place in&#13;
rural areas. Most of the resettlement activities will be governed by both the "Land&#13;
Administration Law" and its local implementation measures. According to the "Land&#13;
Administration Law," S ection 1, Article 2: "for the public interest, the state could&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-134 -                      ANNEX 4.8&#13;
expropriate collectively owned farmland." The essence of the policy is that when the&#13;
state acquires farmland, the land-using units will pay not only a basic compensation for&#13;
land, crop and attached properties, but also job resettlement subsidies. Based on the&#13;
documents issued by the provincial govermment, local governments have specified a&#13;
detailed compensation plan.&#13;
8.    The compensation rates are as follows:&#13;
(a)   State land (uncultivated) at power plant site: Y 1 1,000/mu/1 5 years.&#13;
(b)   Crop land on the transmission route: Y 16,800/mu/l5 years.&#13;
(c)   Vegetable land: Y 17,600/mu/15 years.&#13;
(d)   Crop land leased for construction: Y 1,690/mu.&#13;
(e)   Vegetable land leased for construction: Y 1,780/mu.&#13;
(f)    Closing of small quarry used by single family: Y 50,000 per place.&#13;
(g)   Regular tree: Y 30/piece.&#13;
(h)   Fruit tree: Y 200/piece.&#13;
(i)    Land for transformers: Y 38,000/mu.&#13;
(j)    Relocation of households: Y 200/m2.&#13;
(k)   Relocation subsidy: Y 30/person.&#13;
Resettlement Institutional Responsibility&#13;
9.    EPH has set up a Land Acquisition and Compensation Group composed of three&#13;
to four professionals and local representatives to be responsible for the resettlement. The&#13;
Land Acquisition and Resettlement Group will provide overall leadership and&#13;
coordination during the process of resettlement planning and implementation, which&#13;
includes thirty party supervisor. More specifically, it will:&#13;
(a)   participate in the process of preliminary design and alignment selection,&#13;
including surveys of land acquisition and any affected households,&#13;
consultation with local communities; and estimation of compensation&#13;
costs;&#13;
(b)   participate in the finalization of alignment design in the field, including&#13;
verification of land acquisition, determination of the number of affected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-135 -                       ANNEX 4.8&#13;
households, and other lost properties; and formulation of "Project Land&#13;
Acquisition and Building Demolition Table," which will be the basis for&#13;
the resettlement action plan;&#13;
(c)   discuss with relevant local government agencies on various compensation&#13;
policies and resettlement programs, which will then be formulated into&#13;
local decrees issued by the local governments;&#13;
(d)   negotiate  compensation  and  rehabilitation  contracts with  affected&#13;
communities, particularly for all substations; and processing land&#13;
acquisition applications with provincial and affected county land bureaus;&#13;
and&#13;
(e)   supervise and coordinate individual contractors during the implementation&#13;
the resettlement action plan.&#13;
Budget and Timetable&#13;
10.   Based on the preliminary budget projection, resettlement costs will total&#13;
approximately Y 70.33 million. This includes a 6 percent contingency and 3 percent&#13;
administration expense. According to Chinese regulations, the Y 49.62 million on the&#13;
state land acquisition will be paid to the Jiyuan City Government.&#13;

Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
11.   The objective of monitoring and evaluation is to ensure that the resettlement&#13;
program is implemented smoothly and to see whether resettled people restore their living&#13;
condition and income level after relocation.  The agreed outline of the first-year&#13;
monitoring report includes reviewing resettlement progress among all components;&#13;
examining the us of resettlement funds; and assessing situation regarding production&#13;
restoration among relocated population, if any; living condition improvements (housing&#13;
and related services and facilities); and administration capacity of resettlement&#13;
organizations. The group will produce a resettlement progress report for the project&#13;
office and the Bank every six months.  After the completion of resettlement&#13;
implementation, a resettlement evaluation report will be completed.&#13;
Conflict Resolution and Grievance Procedure&#13;
12.  If an affected person is not satisfied with the compensation package or if, for any&#13;
reason, the compensation does not materialized according to the agreed schedule, he or&#13;
she could go through a grievance procedure specified in the resettlement action plan.&#13;

13.   The complainer can voice his or her concern to the responsible resettlement&#13;
offices, or could bring the case to the "Public Complaint Office," which exists in both&#13;
county and municipality level governments, directly under the governors' offices, or&#13;
request an administrative review of the case by the same or higher level of government&#13;
and appeal directly in court, if he or she is not satisfied with the governor's decision.&#13;

ANNEX 4.9: ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM&#13;
A. Summary of Key Project Environmental Issues&#13;
Air Pollution&#13;
1.    Table 1 presents air pollution characteristics for the proposed project (1,200 MW)&#13;
and the total power program planned for the site (3,600 MW). As can be seen, emission&#13;
standards for dust, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are all in compliance with Chinese&#13;
standards and World Bank guidelines for both design coal and check coal cases. Air&#13;
quality data are also presented, and for sulfur dioxide, the project (1,200 MW) and overall&#13;
program (3,600 MW) will not result in a violation of World Bank guidelines. PRC&#13;
(Grade Il) standards are likewise not exceeded for annual and 24-hour averages, though&#13;
one exceedance of the 1-hour standard was predicted from the dispersion modeling in a&#13;
nonprotected portion of the mountain region (details may be found in the EAR). Existing&#13;
background dust levels exceed both Chinese standards and World Bank guidelines. This&#13;
is not unusual for China in general, and in particular for this area which is exceptionally&#13;
dry. With project implementation, and ultimately with the overall program, these dust&#13;
levels will be slightly elevated (a maximum of 0.5 percent for the project and 1.5 percent&#13;
for the program, with respect to "one maximum" values). This is not believed to be&#13;
problematic for several reasons; maximums are at the plant site which is uninhabited and,&#13;
at the nearest major population center (Jiyuan City), anticipated increases in dust levels&#13;
are about one third the values of those at the plant site. These differences are well below&#13;
the monitoring errors and the modeling uncertainties (0.2 percent for the project and 0.6&#13;
percent for the program); and the local government (including the regional environmental&#13;
protection board) supports the project.&#13;
2.    Although ambient measurements of nitrogen oxides were not made, it is unlikely&#13;
to be a problem because of limited sources (traffic, fuel combustion) in the region.&#13;
Furthermore, low NOx burners are to be included in order to meet emission levels to&#13;
comply with Chinese and World Bank emission standards for NOx. Thus appropriate&#13;
mitigating measures are being taken as would be taken had an issue of NOx been&#13;
identified.&#13;
3.    Carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to be 0.0065 and 0.0195 billion tons/year&#13;
for the 1,200 MW and 3,600 MW situations respectively. This represents 0.03 and 0.09&#13;
percent of the annual industrial global burden. Therefore both the project and the overall&#13;
program should present an insignificant impact on global warming.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-139 -                           ANNEX 4.9&#13;
Water Pollution&#13;
4.     Wastewaters will be discharged after appropriate treatment to meet Chinese&#13;
standards and World Bank guidelines. Treatment will be physical, chemical and/or&#13;
biological. Cooling towers will be used and some cooling tower blowdown will be used&#13;
for bottom ash sluicing and dust suppression at the ash disposal yard. All effluent&#13;
discharges, after treatment, will be to the Baijan river, which is primarily a dry river bed&#13;
from September to June and only experiences flow conditions during July and August.&#13;
There is a potential issue of these effluent discharges contaminating downstream&#13;
groundwater used for irrigation. If the effluent and irrigation water monitoring program&#13;
(see Table C.2) indicate a problem, EPH agreed to drill alternate wells and construct&#13;
necessary irrigation systems to provide farmers an acceptable water supply. Drinking&#13;
water wells are all upstream of the discharge and should not be affected. During these&#13;
dry periods these surface discharges percolate to the aquifer and thereby recharge (in part)&#13;
the water supply source for this project.&#13;

Coal Transport and Handling&#13;
6.    Fuel will be supplied from the two main sources: the Houzhou Coal Mine Bureau&#13;
(Linfen prefecture) and the Changzi Coal Transport and Supply Branch Company. Fuel&#13;
from the Houzhou mines will be shipped by rail along the southern Tong-Pu railway line&#13;
and the Houma-Yueshan railway line to the Qinbei north railway station. Fuel from the&#13;
Changzi mines will be shipped by the Tai Jiao railway line and then along the Jiao Zhi&#13;

railway line to Qinbei. The power station is about 150 km from the Changzi mines and&#13;
270 km from the Houzhou mines. For the project (1,200 MW) about 3.5 million&#13;
tons/year of fuel will be supplied from both mines. Fuel will be a mixture of lean coal,&#13;
bituminous, and washed middlings in the following proportions:&#13;

7.    Washed middlings are derived from a coal washing plant in Houzhou whose main&#13;
customer is a nearby steel mill.&#13;
8.    Both rail lines are to be utilized for a variety of freight, and project&#13;
implementation would not overburden current or future freight movement. Project&#13;

9.    At the coal storage yard, water sprinkling facilities will be installed to prevent&#13;
coal dust dispersion. Spraying will be done on a regular basis and during coal dumping.&#13;
The coal coniveyor operation, crusher room, rotary dumper rooms and transfer points will&#13;
be enclosed and dust collection equipment installed. All excess water runoff at the coal&#13;
yard will be collected and treated (suspended solids and pH) prior to discharge.&#13;
Ash Management&#13;
10.   Fly ash and slag will be removed separately. Slag will be slurried and pumped to&#13;
a dewatering bin and then either trucked or conveyed to the dry ash disposal area or sold.&#13;
Trucking and conveying alternatives are currently under study in terms of&#13;
environmental/economic factors.  If trucking is determined to be the appropriate&#13;
alternative, a dedicated highway will be constructed to avoid truck traffic interference&#13;
with local residents. Excess water will be sent for treatment as part of the chemical&#13;
wastewater stream. Fly ash will be sent to an ash silo pneumatically where it will be&#13;
mixed with a small amount of water (25 percent) and either trucked or conveyed to the&#13;
dry ash disposal yard or sold to consumers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-143-                       ANNEX4.9&#13;
11.   Two dry ash disposal yards sites are available: the Liuchun and Dongluzai sites.&#13;
The Liuchun side located in the flood plain on the left bank of the Qin river about 4.5 km&#13;
south of the plant site is preferred. All boundaries of this ashyard will be confined by&#13;
dikes whose height will be established to protect against the 50-year flood. An additional&#13;
dike will be constructed to contain any flooding which might result from the alternate&#13;
runoff pattern introduced by the presence of the ashyard. The Dongluzai dry ashyard is&#13;
located 4 km east of the plant site. Both sites can together accommodate about 15 years&#13;
of ash deposition (either design or check coal) at the full operation of 3,600 MW.&#13;
12.   Permeability at the site of Liuchun is relatively high (10-5 cm/sec) so an&#13;
impermeable liner of either compacted clay or plastic will be laid down at the ashyard&#13;
first. Groundwater in the area is used by farmers for drinking and irrigation; however,&#13;
groundwater beneath the ashyard is expected to flow away from any drinking water wells.&#13;
Additionally, in this region, annual evaporation rates exceed precipitation rates by almost&#13;
1,000 mm and laboratory tests indicated that water migration from the ashyard should not&#13;
reach the groundwater level which is three to four meters below the base of the ashyard.&#13;
13.   Nonetheless, the Liuchun ashyard does present a slightly greater than normal risk&#13;
of groundwater contamination. Therefore, groundwater monitoring will play a critical&#13;
role in the environmental management plan. In addition, if a problem arises, the Borrower&#13;
will reevaluate the liner design and construction and make necessary corrections before&#13;
disposal is continued. The sector of the ash disposal site in use at the time problems are&#13;
identified would be capped with clay and topsoil, and disposal resumed at a section of the&#13;
ashyard that would have been repaired. If the problem still persists, the Borrower agrees&#13;
to switch ash disposal to the Dongluzai site.&#13;
14.   Dust suppression will be maintained by spraying 10 mm of water per month&#13;
during periods of low or no rainfall. Additionally, the ash surface will be compressed by&#13;
rolling, and trees planted at the periphery to decrease wind speed.&#13;
15.   When the site is complete, it will be covered with clay and topsoil and then&#13;
planted with vegetation.&#13;
Transmission Line&#13;
16.   The 165-km 500 kV transmission line will be designed in such fashion that the&#13;
maximum electric field strength at 1.5 meters above the ground surface will be 5 kV/m&#13;
(500 KV Substation Design Provisional Technical Regulation: SDGJ69-85). The design&#13;
will further limit induction currents to 0.5 ma. There are no World Bank standards for&#13;
electric field strengths, but the maximum value is considered safe (within limits&#13;
experienced by using an electric heating blanket) and should not cause damage to any&#13;
vegetation. The transmission line route has been selected to avoid villages and towns, so&#13;
there are no issues of resettlement or compensation for dismantling of existing structures.&#13;
Approximately 80 m2 of land is occupied by each cable support tower. Affected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-144-                      ANNEX 4.9&#13;
landowners will be reimbursed for this use with a one-time payment based upon loss-of-&#13;
land use for fifteen years. Noise levels on the average comply with Chinese standards&#13;
and World Bank guidelines. Both electric field monitoring along the transmission route&#13;
and noise monitoring are part of the overall monitoring plan (see Section C).&#13;
17.   The issue of migratory bird routes over the transmission corridors were examined&#13;
in the updated EAR (April, 1995) and it was concluded that any impacts would be small&#13;
or negligible. Additionally, the Henan Provincial Environmental Protection Agency has&#13;
verified that the proposed project does not cross or influence any natural protection zones.&#13;
Aquatic/Terrestrial Ecology&#13;
18.   The plant will be located at a site that is uninhabited and consists of poor quality,&#13;
uncultivated soil. There are no nature preservation areas, wildlife, fisheries, or forest&#13;
cover of any significance. Any existing ecological communities could establish&#13;
themselves quickly and easily in any number of nearby areas with similar environmental&#13;
conditions.&#13;
Occupational Health and Safety&#13;
19.   Project design will be such that international standards of worker safety will be&#13;
included in all bidding documents of project equipment. Boilers and other dangerous&#13;
equipment will be designed to meet ASME standards of safety and will be so specified in&#13;
the bidding documents. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are illegal in China, their use&#13;
is prohibited in the project. Prohibition of asbestos use will be specified in the bid&#13;
documents.&#13;
Human Environment&#13;
20.   No socio-cultural resources were identified with the Qinbei Power Plant&#13;
construction or operational area of impact. A primary concern is increased truck traffic&#13;
on local roads if ash disposal is to be conducted this way. However, if this alternative for&#13;
ash disposal is selected, impacts would be mitigated by construction of a dedicated road&#13;
and using trucks with increased capacity (to minimize frequency of deliveries). EPH is&#13;
studying the alternative of a dry ash conveyor system. Based upon study results, the most&#13;
economic and environmentally acceptable choice will be made.&#13;
Noise&#13;
21.   Noise estimates indicate that the project (power station and transmission line) will&#13;
conform to Chinese standards and World Bank guidelines as indicated in Table 3.&#13;

Summary of Mitigating/Issues Measures&#13;
Issue/Pollutants                                  Control Method Recommended&#13;
Sulfur Dioxide Emissions    Burning low sulfur coal (S=0.41 percent for design coal). High chimney (240m)&#13;
dispersion and reserve space to install desulfurization device (FGD) if necessary.&#13;
Dust Emissions              Use of high efficiency (99.6 percent) electrostatic precipitator (ESP) to satisfy exit&#13;
concentration limit of 100 mg/Nm 3, possible installation of flue gas conditioning&#13;
(FGC) system if ESP performance does not meet standard.&#13;
Nitrogen Oxides             Use of low NOx burner, with design specifications in the bid document of NOx&#13;
discharge concentrations to be less than 273 ng/J.&#13;
Chemical Wastewater        Various streams collected and sent to chemical wastewater treatment plant prior to&#13;
discharge.&#13;
Sanitary Sewage             Biochemical treatment.&#13;
Oil Contaminated            Air flotation separation.&#13;
Wastewater&#13;
Coal Yard Runoff            Collected, sent to setting pond for removal of suspended solids.&#13;
Ash and Slag Disposal       After wetting, dry ash and slag from boiler are conveyed (truck or belt) to dry ash&#13;
disposal yard. Ash and slag deposited at the yard will be leveled, rolled and&#13;
sprayed with water in time. Ashyard is partitioned in blocks. When one block pile&#13;
of ash reaches the designated height, it is covered by clay, then topsoil, then&#13;
planted with grass. Development of a program/market for utilization of ash and&#13;
slag. For prevent groundwater contamination, either a clay or plastic membrane&#13;
liner will be placed at the ash site with a permeability of 10 7 cm/sec.&#13;
If the groundwater monitoring program indicates development of adverse water&#13;
quality conditions, the block will be capped with clay, the remaining liner&#13;
construction examined to check permeability. If detective, the remaining liner will&#13;
be repaired, and disposal continued in the repaired section of the ashyard.&#13;
If this measure is unsuccessful, the Dongluzai site will be prepared and used for ash&#13;
disposal.&#13;
Dust (at Ashyard)          Trees planted at the edge of the yard to suppress dust formation. Cooling tower&#13;
blowdown water sprinkled on active ash block. After block is complete, it will be&#13;
covered and planted.&#13;
Noise                       Maximum allowable noise levels to be specified in bid document is 90 dB(A).&#13;
When necessary, install sound insulation cover or build sound insulation room.&#13;
Silencers to be installed at steam discharge pipe outlet, safety valve and forced&#13;
draft fan (FDF) outlet.&#13;
Vegetative Die-off          Replant affected areas with hardier/pollution resistant species.&#13;
Flooding Upstream of the    Additional upstream dike construction to confine floodwaters.&#13;
Ashyard Dike&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Henan (Qinbei) Thermal Power Project
            has the following main objectives: (1) to reduce the acute
            power shortages and foster integrated development of the
            power system of Henan Province in the most cost-effective
            and environmentally sound manner; (2) to support adequate
            implementation of power sector and power enterprise reforms
            and accelerate the transition of the Electric Power of Henan
            to a legally and financially autonomous and
            business-oriented company; (3) to assist in transfering new
            power technologies and in applying modern power
            operation/maintenance methods; (4) to support improvements
            in the efficiency of electricity use; and (5) to contribute
            to the rationalization of power tariffs. The project
            components will include the construction of new coal-fired
            thermal power units and an online performance monitoring
            system to increase plant performance; the erection of
            transmission lines to connect the power plant to the
            existing power transmission network; a technical assistance
            package to support the implementation of a power sector
            reform action plan; an electricity conservation component;
            and training to build capabilities in power system operation
            and management practices.
