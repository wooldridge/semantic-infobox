            Private infrastructure : a review of
            projects with private participation, 1990-2001
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Drawing on the World Bank's private
            participation in infrastructure project database, this note
            reviews developments in 2001 and summarizes trends in
            1990-2001. Data for 2001 show that total investment in
            projects with private participation was US$57 billion back
            to 1995 levels and 150 projects reached financial closure.
            Between 1990 and 2001, 132 low- and middle-income countries
            introduced private participation in infrastructure sectors
            57 of them in three or four sectors. During that period the
            private sector took over the operating or construction risk,
            or both, for almost 2,500 infrastructure projects in
            developing countries, attracting investment commitments of
            more than US$750 billion. Those projects have been
            implemented under schemes ranging from management contracts
            (with or without investment commitments) to divestitures to
            build-operate-own or build-operate-transfer contracts for
            greenfield projects with merchant facilities.
