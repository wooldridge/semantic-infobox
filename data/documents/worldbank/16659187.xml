INTRODUCTION&#13;
This document presents the FY09-11 business plan. The three year business plan is developed within the&#13;
context of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s new draft global strategy for 2009-2018, which identifies the programâ&#128;&#153;s long-term&#13;
priorities and directions and further provides strategic guidance to WSPâ&#128;&#153;s medium-term subsector&#13;
strategies. These strategy documents are planned to trickle down to management and programming&#13;
decisions including the development of the business plan and annual project sheets, as illustrated in the&#13;
diagram below.&#13;
&#13;
For the preparation of the business plan, specific country activities are discussed in consultation with&#13;
country and regional stakeholders, external partners, embassies, local representatives of donor agencies,&#13;
and World Bank staff. At the country and regional levels, the WSP regional offices conduct consultation&#13;
processes to ensure a bottom-up build up of the business plan. The comprehensive business plan is&#13;
presented to the WSP Council in its annual meeting.&#13;
&#13;
The FY09-11 business plan is&#13;
divided into six sections: a global&#13;
framework, four regional chapters&#13;
following       the     organizational                                              WSP Global Strategy&#13;

&#13;
GLOBAL WSP BUSINESS PLAN FRAMEWORK&#13;
This section presents a brief introduction to the WSP Business Plan framework, including its services,&#13;
focus country selection, comparative advantage, the Programâ&#128;&#153;s planning process and monitoring and&#13;
evaluation (M&amp;E) system. It also presents the proposed FY09-11 portfolio of activities, including a&#13;
description of the main characteristics of the projects that will be under implementation. This section also&#13;
incorporates a few of the core elements of the draft WSP global strategy.&#13;
&#13;
WSP SERVICES&#13;
Working in rural, urban and peri-urban areas, WSPâ&#128;&#153;s strategy going forward will focus on ensuring&#13;
increased access is sustainable and is comprehensive in its coverage. A critical component of this&#13;
strategy is to focus efforts through an integrated set of strategic cross-sectoral interventions in WSS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       1&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                                              FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
These involve:&#13;
&#13;
     (i)          Citizens and consumers: implementing behavior change programs focusing on sanitation&#13;
                  and hygiene, supporting increased sustainable access to WSS services for citizens and&#13;
                  consumers;&#13;
&#13;
     (ii)         Service providers and local government: improving institutions and accountability to&#13;
                  support WSS service providers;&#13;
&#13;
     (iii)        Legal, regulatory, institutional and business environment: catalyzing finance in WSS&#13;
                  services and strengthening governance in regulatory, institutional, and financial&#13;
                  environments;&#13;
&#13;
     (iv)         Governments: supporting governments to strengthen their ability to track improvements in&#13;
                  water, sanitation and hygiene, through improved M&amp;E systems and implementing&#13;
                  programmatic approaches; and&#13;
&#13;
     (v)          Donors and development partners: aligning donors and facilitating strategic partnerships&#13;
                  among different stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
To this end, WSP activities are structured around a Results Framework (Figure 1 below) that links its&#13;
services and products with its overall mission. This framework is translated at the activity level into a&#13;
simplified log frame structure with specific indicators of final and intermediate outcomes. The&#13;
framework makes it possible for WSP to prioritize high impact activities and concentrate on our&#13;
comparative advantage.&#13;

 Activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP services and products can be classified in three groups:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢        Policy support and Institutional development: Working as agents of change, WSP provides&#13;
              advice to help countries adopt more effective policies and strategies and to undertake required&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                     2&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                         FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        reforms. The mutual interaction between WSP's services, its field networking, partnership&#13;
        approach, participatory style and interactions with local decision-makers helps build countriesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
        policy focus and capacity to improve service access.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Strategic investment and policy support: Advice and support to the investment programs of its&#13;
        clients and partners who are seeking to break new ground and generate new field knowledge or&#13;
        are strategically critical to make reforms a reality and to scale up innovation and investment&#13;
        programs.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Knowledge management, generation and synthesis: Learning for action to generate, validate,&#13;
        and disseminate innovative solutions to water and sanitation problems and develop new sector&#13;
        knowledge. Drawing from experience in different contexts the WSP synthesizes field knowledge&#13;
        and experience and communicates this to sector decision-makers.&#13;
&#13;
EXPANDING AND MAINTAINING THE SUBSTANTIVE FOCUS FOR SCALING UP&#13;
The MDGs have catalyzed a renewed emphasis on the achievement of specific targets in the provision of&#13;
WSS services, which calls for a sharp focus on scaled-up investment programs supported by well-&#13;
designed policy and sector reforms. WSP works with partners to find solutions to the significant&#13;
obstacles that prevent achievement of the MDGs, such as the sheer complexity of the WSS sector itself;&#13;
the huge and growing scale of service backlog; the difficulty of creating significant demand for sanitation&#13;
in which behavior change is key; the lack of fiscal and financial approaches that provide incentives for&#13;
customer-responsive and financially sustainable service delivery; the institutional dysfunction; and the&#13;
challenges of aligning development assistance.&#13;
&#13;
To achieve significant successes in WSS at the global and country level, and to move closer to bringing&#13;
countries closer to meeting the WSS MDGs, WSP will have to focus its work program on the following&#13;
general areas within the cross-sectoral themes that will guide WSPâ&#128;&#153;s global strategy for 2009-2018.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   For citizens and customers, support increased sustainable access to services: Sanitation and&#13;
        hygiene: behavior change programs and development of local sanitation service industry,&#13;
        sanitation ministerial conferences; Better approaches to improve services to the poor: domestic&#13;
        private sector, rural WSS services, work in slums; Cross-sectoral linkages: gender, education,&#13;
        urban planning and management, environmental and health outcomes;&#13;
    â&#128;¢   For service providers, improve institutions and accountability and provide capacity&#13;
        support to decentralized levels of governments. Governance and accountability:&#13;
        communication for reform, decentralization processes, civil society participation, anti-corruption,&#13;
        improved monitoring and benchmarking; Service coverage: capacity to provide access to un-&#13;
        served areas, innovative approaches to access in slums, peri-urban areas and small towns, and&#13;
        replicability of these approaches;&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Strengthen the legal, regulatory, institutional, and business environment between&#13;
        service providers and governments. Financing strategies: effective use of resources and&#13;
        leveraging additional resources for investment, fiscal incentives, improved and sustainable&#13;
        financial streams, and PPPs; Comprehensive policy development: engage decision making at&#13;
        national, decentralized state and local government, and community levels; Global Learning: for&#13;
        quick learning exchange and dissemination to increase investments and improve project designs&#13;
        across regions;&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Support to governments to build awareness and strengthen its abilities to track improvements&#13;
        in water, sanitation and hygiene: MDG roadmaps and programmatic approaches: development&#13;
        and implementation support to large-scale programs; M&amp;E: contributing to strengthening&#13;
        national M&amp;E systems and sector monitoring and data reporting; Fragile states: expand focus&#13;
        countries to include newly created governments from conflict and fragile states; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    3&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                          FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢    Align multiple donors and increasing partnerships among different stakeholders: Donor&#13;
         harmonization: align multiple interventions, and promote programmatic approach for WSS sub-&#13;
         sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP FOCUS COUNTRIES&#13;
WSP seeks to reach and have impact in all regions, where the poor have inadequate water and sanitation&#13;
services and where there are lessons to be learned on how to apply successful solutions. WSP is currently&#13;
engaged across four regions in the following countries:&#13;
&#13;
    i)   Africa â&#128;&#147; Benin, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique,&#13;
         Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia;&#13;
    ii) East Asia and Pacific â&#128;&#147; Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Vietnam;&#13;
    iii) Latin America and the Caribbean â&#128;&#147; Honduras, Nicaragua, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador; and&#13;
    iv) South Asia â&#128;&#147; Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
The level of engagement of WSP in any given country is the result of a combination of factors including&#13;
strategic fit, history and funding. As it seeks to maximize its global impact, WSP continues to adopt a&#13;
strategic and coherent approach in assessing the breadth and depth of its involvement in specific&#13;
countries. The dialogue and strategic collaboration with the regional development banks (AfDB, ADB&#13;
and IADB) is also growing.&#13;
&#13;
Investment advice and knowledge-collecting operations from countries where there are important lessons&#13;
to be learned will generally not require field presence and can be achieved through short-term missions,&#13;
outsourcing or studies. All countries, including those not directly targeted by WSP, will be reached&#13;
through regional and global conferences as well as through WSP publications and knowledge&#13;
management activities.&#13;
&#13;
WSP plans for exit strategies where its services are no longer needed and where countries and sectors&#13;
have built sufficient capacity and have the right instruments, tools and approaches to scale up sustainable&#13;
WSS. WSP will exit countries and sectors that have achieved the following conditions: (a) local&#13;
institutions, advisors and agencies have the capacity to deliver WSP products and support services and&#13;
lead sector development; (b) coverage and quality of services to the poor or their behaviors are scaling up;&#13;
and (c) capacity within the sector is deep enough and good policies, systems and practices are embedded&#13;
enough to survive bureaucratic and political changes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE&#13;
The 2004 External Evaluationâ&#128;&#153;s overall finding is that WSP was effective and efficient in the service of&#13;
valuable objectives during the review period. The evaluation concluded that: (a) WSPâ&#128;&#153;s work had&#13;
achieved relevant outcomes in diverse situations, with considerable impact already observed and likely to&#13;
follow; and (b) WSP has significant comparative advantages relative to other organizations working in the&#13;
WSS field. Its partnership style enables it to collaborate and complement those of other organizations&#13;
where appropriate. WSPâ&#128;&#153;s global reach, valuable contacts, long track record, high professional capacity,&#13;
and ability to maintain continuing real-time contact with key decision-makers all give it particular&#13;
advantage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     4&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                           FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP specifically has:&#13;
&#13;
    a) Specialist knowledge through its high caliber staff that is representative of some of the most up-&#13;
       to-date thinking and knowledge, that is field-based and therefore able to effectively deal with&#13;
       local conditions;&#13;
    b) Global and regional presence: the network of WSP operations and skills deployed around the&#13;
       world enables it to draw relevant global experience and create links between countries grappling&#13;
       with similar problems;&#13;
    c) Independence: WSP is uniquely placed to provide independent advisory services which are not&#13;
       subject to lending and project pressures;&#13;
    d) Wide network of strategic collaboration: With about 30 yearsâ&#128;&#153; experience and a unique&#13;
       partnership structure, WSP is able to attract a wide range of partners and coordinate interventions&#13;
       to maximize impact; and&#13;
    e) Potential to leverage World Bank operations: WSPâ&#128;&#153;s location in the World Bank enables it to&#13;
       create linkages between policy development and capacity building and future investment&#13;
       programs and provides potential to expand WSP influence beyond our client and focus countries.&#13;
&#13;
WSP will continue to build on its comparative strengths while preparing for the upcoming External&#13;
Evaluation for the period FY 2004 â&#128;&#147; 2008.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
STRATEGIC COLLABORATION&#13;
Collaboration is at the heart of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s work. The Program operates at multiple levels (national, regional&#13;
and global) and working with partners is therefore an important mechanism for increasing its impact at all&#13;
these levels. In particular, partners on the ground at country level are crucial since they are ultimately the&#13;
ones who effect the changes and implement the investments required to increase access to those without&#13;
services. The Program engages with a broad range of stakeholders, from client governments to NGOs,&#13;
partner sector organizations to donors and the World Bank in the following partnership typologies:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Funding partnerships which are formal and signed with financial supporters of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s work at&#13;
        global, regional, country and project level. These are mostly donor agencies and the World Bank.&#13;
        These partnerships are ruled by formal legal agreements reviewed by the legal departments of the&#13;
        World Bank and the donor agency. The recently established MultiDonor Trust Fund will allow&#13;
        for increased flexibility in partnership instruments.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Implementation/investment partnerships in which donor and funding agencies are the main&#13;
        partners. In this type of partnership, WSP works with clients to: (a) design and support country-&#13;
        owned scaled-up programs based on innovative local actions; (b) strengthen capacities of country&#13;
        sector actors to deliver better WSS services to the poor; (c) lay the groundwork for more efficient&#13;
        and effective investments by others; and (d) strengthen sector M&amp;E systems at country level in&#13;
        support of the JMP efforts as well as to improve accountability, transparency and effectiveness of&#13;
        WSS investments. WSP is also involved in an important and growing engagement with regional&#13;
        development banks in support of their efforts to scale up services to the unserved (e.g., the&#13;
        African Development Bank on their Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative for Africa and&#13;
        the Asian Development Bank in East Asia in scaling up RWSS).&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Policy influencing collaborations, which are long-term partnerships with counterpart&#13;
        organizations, national and local governments, utilities and other service providers, among others.&#13;
        WSPâ&#128;&#153;s major role in this type of partnership is to link national level policy makers with&#13;
        international best practice and potential funding partners and strengthen the capacities of country&#13;
        sector actors to deliver better WSS services to the poor. Examples include AMCOW, regional&#13;
        development banks, European Union Water Facility and various embassies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      5&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                                            FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢    Learning/knowledge management collaborations, in which WSP works to improve sector&#13;
          knowledge, disseminate new ideas and organize high profile events such as the series of&#13;
          sanitation conferences (AFRICASAN, EASAN, LATINOSAN, and SACOSAN). WSP has a&#13;
          solid range of partnerships of this type which include WSSCC, WHO, UNDP, UNSGAB,&#13;
          WEDC, IRC, LSHTM, UNICEF, as well as other global programs administered by the World&#13;
          Bank (PPIAF, GPOBA, BNWP, and Cities Alliance).&#13;
     â&#128;¢    Networking and capacity-building collaborations, which have been a major focus for WSP. The&#13;
          Program usually brings specialized knowledge on how to organize capacity building processes to&#13;
          support national or regional networks. One of the early examples of this type of partnership is&#13;
          with the ITNs; network of alliances in the Latin America (CAN, FOCARD, RRASCA, RASNIC,&#13;
          etc) and in South Asia (WESTNET, Solutions Exchange); Utility Networks (SEAWAUN,&#13;
          SAWUN, AWUN); and Regulatorsâ&#128;&#153; Networks (SAFIR, AFUR, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
Relationship with the World Bank: WSP is administered by the World Bank which has fiduciary&#13;
responsibility. This relationship places WSP in a unique position, allowing it to have influence well&#13;
beyond the 25 focus countries. This allows WSP to:&#13;
     â&#128;¢    Learn from the global reach of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s investment experience and bring lessons from&#13;
          focus countries to influence investment approaches;&#13;
     â&#128;¢    Influence World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s investment impacts, especially on services to the poor;&#13;
     â&#128;¢    Lay the ground work and upstream project identification for World Bank investments within our&#13;
          focus countriesâ&#128;&#153; investment frameworks;&#13;
     â&#128;¢    Contribute to and influence World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s country assistance strategy formulation and analytical&#13;
          work;&#13;
     â&#128;¢    Broaden the dialogue with development partners and the World Bank in focus and other&#13;
          countries;&#13;
     â&#128;¢    Establish operational linkages with other World Bank administered global programs (GPOBA,&#13;
          PPIAF, ESMAP, BNWP, Cities Alliance);&#13;
     â&#128;¢    Build on a broad range of sector activities, investment and knowledge of World Bank to establish&#13;
          cross-sectoral linkages at country level; and&#13;
     â&#128;¢    Participate in policy formulation, portfolio and staff quality review as well as new sectoral&#13;
          thinking through Program Managerâ&#128;&#153;s seat in the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water Sector Board.&#13;
&#13;
This relationship with the World Bank also means that donor resources to WSP are managed, applied and&#13;
monitored using international best practice systems and processes for financial management, procurement&#13;
and safeguards to ensure adherence to the signed Administrative Agreements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP PLANNING PROCESS AND M&amp;E SYSTEM&#13;
WSPâ&#128;&#153;s strategic planning process and M&amp;E system is based on the following constitutive elements:&#13;
â&#128;¢    Global strategy for 2009-2018 (draft)&#13;
â&#128;¢    Medium-term subsector strategies1&#13;
â&#128;¢    Three year business plans, including:&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Global, regional and country strategies&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Individual project sheets and budgets&#13;
     â&#128;¢ Annual work plans and budgets&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
 The first subsector strategy to be prepared is Sanitation Strategy, which was presented and discussed at the June 2008 council.&#13;
Other strategies to expected to follow include Hygiene, Country M&amp;E, and Domestic Private Sector Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                6&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                          FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   Mid-year progress review&#13;
â&#128;¢   End-of-year review&#13;
&#13;
The planning process begins with the preparation of the annual work planning cycle (covering July 1 â&#128;&#147;&#13;
June 30) which represents the start of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s management cycle. Each year, WSP staff, with inputs from&#13;
stakeholders (client countries in particular, donors and other stakeholders and partners), and taking into&#13;
account new opportunities, engage in a process of preparing the business plan.&#13;
&#13;
The business plan goes through a rigorous quality enhancement process by the WSP Program Management&#13;
Team (PMT) to ensure continuity, relevance, thematic coherence, and availability of adequate funds. The&#13;
business plan is further subjected to a validation process which involves Regional Advisory Committee&#13;
(representatives of key stakeholders at the regional level) and the World Bank regions to ensure synergy,&#13;
strengthen collaboration and ensure relevance to the countries in which we overlap and others beyond our&#13;
focus countries. The business plan is sent to the Council for approval.&#13;
&#13;
Each WSP region prepares, through the process described above, regional strategies that outline the&#13;
particular obstacles, opportunities, and strategies for the WSS sector in that region. The regional strategies&#13;
lead to country and thematic strategies that further define the role that WSP will play in its focus countries.&#13;
The precise role that WSP will play is captured in the individual project sheets. The project sheets detail&#13;
each project that WSP works on, its objectives, and desired outcomes, indicators for the outcome,&#13;
milestones, activities, and estimated budget. The individual project sheets are placed on the WSP website,&#13;
www.wsp.org.&#13;
&#13;
Further strengthening of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s M&amp;E systems: WSP continues to strengthen its M&amp;E systems to: (a)&#13;
focus on outcomes and results and while linking them to WSPâ&#128;&#153;s mission and strategy, and (b) strengthen&#13;
the capacity of staff to undertake M&amp;E and deepen the results culture using storylines. WSP has&#13;
developed and begun to implement an M&amp;E system based on storylines, elements of which were&#13;
presented to the 2006 council meeting. Using such qualitative tools has allowed WSP to more clearly&#13;
elaborate on the following questions: (a) the problems that WSP is seeking to address; (b) strategies to&#13;
address the identified problems; and (c) evidence of success and what is happening on the ground&#13;
including performance indicators. A number of projects were selected for this pilot and examples&#13;
presented at the 2007 council meeting. Lessons from this approach, as well as from other comparator&#13;
organizations, have enabled WSP to develop an M&amp;E framework, which has been presented to the&#13;
council in June 2008 and which will be further developed in the coming year (Figure 1). In addition,&#13;
IEGâ&#128;&#153;s forthcoming study on the M&amp;E systems of various global and regional partnership programs as&#13;
well as the findings of the External Evaluation of WSP due in 2009 are expected to further shape WSPâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
work in this area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP STRATEGY UPDATE&#13;
 WSPâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Operating Principles (SOP), prepared based on a review of strategy documents for&#13;
comparable programs and based on donor and stakeholder consultation, had been intended to define the&#13;
core operational principles of the Program with a view to providing guidance to staff and clarity to&#13;
partners (country partners, financial partners, and operational partners). At the recommendation of the&#13;
council at its June 2008 meeting, the document has been merged with WSPâ&#128;&#153;s new draft global strategy.&#13;
&#13;
The following describes the current set of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s strategy and management documents:&#13;
    â&#128;¢   WSPâ&#128;&#153;s draft global strategy for 2009-2018, which has been presented at the June 2008 council&#13;
        meeting. It provides a detailed vision of how WSP will deepen its engagement to support clients&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                       FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        to meet the MDGs, and more importantly, focus on sustainable practices that continue to increase&#13;
        access to reliable, safe and sustainable water and sanitation services and hygiene promotion for&#13;
        the poor beyond the MDGs;&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Sub-sector strategies â&#128;&#147; the first document to be prepared is the Sanitation Strategy. It was also&#13;
        discussed at this yearâ&#128;&#153;s council;&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Three-year rolling business plan â&#128;&#147; with regional and country strategies; and&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Annual project sheets.&#13;
&#13;
GUIDING ISSUES FOR FY09-11 BUSINESS PLAN&#13;
The main themes and overall direction of the draft global strategy, as described in the previous section,&#13;
have been incorporated in the guiding areas of work for the FY09-11 business plan leading to renewed&#13;
focus on key areas, particularly sanitation. Key issues that have guided preparation of the FY09-11&#13;
business plan include:&#13;
&#13;
    a) Focus on the MDGs: With less than 10 years to go to achieve the WSS MDG target, there is a&#13;
       need to tailor efforts and focus on specific conditions in each region:&#13;
        â&#128;¢   Africa: The region lags behind other regions in meeting the MDGs. Efforts to get the region&#13;
            closer to these targets require focus to support countries in accelerating implementation of&#13;
            sector reforms, improved governance and development of road maps, specific approaches for&#13;
            fragile/post-conflict states, financing strategies to implement large scale programs in both&#13;
            water supply and sanitation and support capacity development for national and regional&#13;
            policy makers and service providers;&#13;
        â&#128;¢   East Asia and the Pacific: Increase the efficiency and effectiveness of investments through&#13;
            support for developing financing strategies, the design and supervision of large-scale&#13;
            investments, and by generating and sharing lessons from field experience;&#13;
        â&#128;¢   Latin America and the Caribbean: Integrate MDGs in government strategies and in&#13;
            particular to address the large inequality in services provision; put greater emphasis on&#13;
            sanitation development; and&#13;
        â&#128;¢   South Asia: The region is on track to meet its water MDGs, but is falling behind in&#13;
            sanitation. Focus on efforts to bring about greater commitment to institutional reforms&#13;
            necessary to achieve the MDGs and catalyze institutional change around policy environment,&#13;
            sector transformation, service provider reform, and social accountability.&#13;
&#13;
    b) Client country demands and inputs: The core of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s work is at the country level, where the&#13;
       program aims to make a difference by enhancing clientsâ&#128;&#153; efforts at increasing access to&#13;
       sustainable WSS services through improved policies and strategies, and better design of programs&#13;
       to have poverty impact and application of innovation from WSP work. WSP seeks to support&#13;
       governmentsâ&#128;&#153; efforts to make more effective use of public funds, leverage additional funding&#13;
       from international financing agencies, and improve water and sanitation services by strengthening&#13;
       and leveraging the skills and capacities of all stakeholders. The country is WSPâ&#128;&#153;s most important&#13;
       client and its involvement is an important early step in the business planning process in guiding&#13;
       the scope, focus and direction of the programâ&#128;&#153;s work in any given year.&#13;
&#13;
    c) Ability to scale up knowledge: Global projects and Global Practice Teams (GPTs) provide a key&#13;
       opportunity to create knowledge about the issues, what works which interventions are critical to&#13;
       ensure sustainable service delivery. The work of the GPTs continues to enhance and support WSPâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
       projects in each country in this business plan. In FY09, the funding for the DFID sponsored&#13;
       Domestic Private Sector Program (DPSP) initiative draws to an end. It is clear that the knowledge&#13;
       gained during the implementation of the initiative, raising the awareness of the potential of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   8&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                       FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        domestic private sector, the range of issues, from regulatory framework to institutional and sector&#13;
        reform, to transactions support for large and small transactions continues to be valuable to WSPâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
        governments, and there has been great client demand in scaling up these activities during the next&#13;
        three years.&#13;
&#13;
    d) Lessons from implementation of previous business plans: Every six months, during the mid-year&#13;
       review (MYR) and the end-year review (EYR), WSP carries out an analysis to assess the extent to&#13;
       which the targets of the business plan are being achieved, and to draw lessons for strengthening&#13;
       implementation of the current and subsequent years. The results/implementation experiences of the&#13;
       EYR for FY07 and MYR for FY08 have been incorporated and used to prepare the FY09-11&#13;
       business plan.&#13;
&#13;
    e) Move towards a more programmatic approach: This year, South Asia has substantially reduced&#13;
       the number of its project sheets in an effort to move towards an increased programmatic approach.&#13;
       This was partly feasible because a majority of the regionâ&#128;&#153;s projects were completed during FY08,&#13;
       providing a natural opportunity to design new interventions in a more holistic manner. Other&#13;
       regions are looking to follow suit pending South Asiaâ&#128;&#153;s experience, in order to become more&#13;
       strategic and systematic in their business planning and to adopt a programmatic approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GLOBAL LEARNING&#13;
Learning and disseminating lessons from experience is the basis on which WSP provides support for&#13;
policy and institutional development as well as implementation support to leverage resources to scale up&#13;
WSS services to the poor. This knowledge generation and sharing is organized and promoted within the&#13;
framework of a global learning agenda, but focused on increasing sustainable access to WSS services to&#13;
the poor in our client countries. The specific focus of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s global learning agenda is dynamic,&#13;
identified through regular consultation with client countries and partners and adapted to changing needs.&#13;
&#13;
The GPTsâ&#128;&#153; FY09-11 work program includes:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Communications: enhance WSPâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to boost support for strategic communication&#13;
        initiatives of institutions in response to demands of our client countries; support communication&#13;
        and advocacy interventions that respond to WSS challenges;&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Finance: improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public financial management practices in&#13;
        the use of WSS related public/donor resources by stakeholders and leverage additional&#13;
        local/domestic resources;&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Sanitation and Hygiene: identify the current state of knowledge/experiences regarding the&#13;
        relationship between sustainability of changed behaviors and sanitation and hygiene&#13;
        approaches/programs; develop and implement a global strategy of communication and&#13;
        dissemination for sanitation and hygiene knowledge resources;&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Rural Water Supply and Sanitation: analyze the link between productive uses of water of&#13;
        domestic water and improved sustainability of services and systems, gender equality and poverty&#13;
        reduction and how to take productive use initiatives to scale; and&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Urban services to the poor: develop and implement utility reforms to support expansion of&#13;
        access to the poor/ modalities of linking small private providers to utilities and&#13;
        municipalities/addressing small private provider capacity constraints, mobilizing finance in the&#13;
        water marketplace/strengthening the role and voice of the poor in demanding access to affordable&#13;
        services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   9&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                          FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The GPTs have successfully built their cross-regional teams and launched many of the activities in their&#13;
work plans. They are also building vital linkages with the World Bank through the various Thematic&#13;
Groups and with other partners as well as identifying national/regional/global fora in which they can&#13;
share and disseminate their work. WSP has taken further steps to increase the profiles of the GPT and&#13;
strengthen not only their ability to promote thematic networks but also the links between country&#13;
programs within the framework of global themes.&#13;
&#13;
As part of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s global learning activities, the following flagship studies are underway:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Political Economy of Sanitation, whose goal is to enhance operational design and&#13;
        implementation for improved outcomes in the provision of sanitation services by understanding&#13;
        and addressing the political economy of sanitation. The study is expected to: (i) lead to&#13;
        application and refinement of practical tools that teams can use to analyze the political economy&#13;
        of sanitation and (ii) enhance the design and implementation of sanitation operations through a&#13;
        political economy analytical and operational framework;&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Financing policies and practices for reaching the poor with improved sanitation and hygiene&#13;
        interventions whose objectives are to: (i) gain in-depth understanding of current hygiene and&#13;
        sanitation financing practices and policies and their effectiveness in helping to reach the rural and&#13;
        urban poor; and (ii) provide guidance to WSP technical staff and Government clients for the&#13;
        development of sanitation financing policies and practices â&#128;&#147; in the design and preparation of&#13;
        sanitation projects (or project components). The expected outcome is that sanitation and hygiene&#13;
        projects (or components of larger projects) will have financing policies and practices that are&#13;
        based on an informed analysis of global experiences and that effectively contribute to increasing&#13;
        access to sanitation for the urban and rural poor;&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Water and Sanitation Services for the Urban Poor study seeks to capture and disseminate global&#13;
        knowledge on the challenges in the provision of urban services to the poor for use by practitioners&#13;
        and policy makers as they address issues of responsive service provision to the urban poor. The&#13;
        outcome of the study - â&#128;&#156;Guidance Notes on Serving the Urban Poorâ&#128;?, identifies approaches to&#13;
        resolving 12 of the most recurring obstacles for the expansion of services to the urban poor (from&#13;
        administrative and legal barriers, to appropriate financial policies, and vested interests) and it is&#13;
        expected to be completed in September 08; and&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Economics of Sanitation Initiative will assess the costs and benefits of selected sanitation&#13;
        interventions to improve knowledge of the efficiency of different interventions in a range of&#13;
        country settings, the real developmental benefits, and the implications of these for sanitation&#13;
        financing. Overall, the ESI could be seen as an initiative that drives the sector forward by&#13;
        providing stakeholders at different levels with key information that motivates them and enables&#13;
        them to argue for increased sanitation financing and select a more efficient mix of sanitation&#13;
        interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP FY09 PORTFOLIO OF ACTIVITIES&#13;
The FY09-11 business plan shows a growth in the portfolio arising largely from the urgent need for&#13;
strengthened support to countries to make progress towards the MDGs combined with additional support&#13;
by donors. This growth in the portfolio has been accompanied by expanded staffing in order to deliver&#13;
the larger work program. Expansion in staffing will continue into the early part of FY09.&#13;

WSPâ&#128;&#153;s project coding system is designed to reflect the multi-dimensional nature of its activities, while&#13;
maintaining a simple system for use in planning, monitoring and analysis. The coding system is also&#13;
linked to the budgeting and financial monitoring system and provides input for the analysis of global,&#13;
regional and thematic trends for the whole program.&#13;
&#13;
Each project in WSP is characterized by three different attributes: scale, sector and theme. The table&#13;
below shows the possible attributes for each project. In addition, each project is classified in three&#13;
categories, depending on the final product: knowledge management, investment/policy support, or&#13;
capacity building.&#13;

Water was historically the dominant sector in the portfolio, at 55% in FY06 and 59% in FY07&#13;
respectively while sanitation and hygiene (combined) accounted for 45% and 41% over the same period.&#13;
However, in FY08, the balance shifted towards sanitation and hygiene where most of the new FY08&#13;
projects were implemented. Sanitation alone accounted for 46% of the portfolio in FY08, while Hygiene&#13;
accounted for 22% leaving water with 32%. In FY09, the portfolio will balance more evenly between the&#13;
three sectors, but sanitation maintains its dominance with 39% of the portfolio. Water and hygiene share&#13;
the remainder evenly at 30 and 31% respectively. This shift in the portfolio reflects WSPâ&#128;&#153;s consistent&#13;
efforts to support countries meet the WSS MDGs where the greatest gaps are.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to shifting its emphasis between water, sanitation, and hygiene, WSP has responded to&#13;
changes in population growth by focusing a greater portion of the portfolio on Peri-Urban and Rural&#13;
environments. Rural still accounts for the largest share with an increase from 36.8% in FY08 to 40% in&#13;
FY09. Peri-Urban grew from 15.7% in FY08 to 23% in FY09, while urban shrunk from 28.8% in FY08&#13;
to 20% in FY09. Small towns remained relatively stable down from 18.8% in FY08 to 17% in FY09. This&#13;
flexibility is evidence of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s ability and commitment to identifying problems and barriers client&#13;
countries face in meeting MDGs, and developing relevant solutions.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
BUDGET SUMMARY&#13;
This business plan includes improved budget information and analysis than in the past. There is a new&#13;
budget summary table by region that provides an overview by country and theme, and the project-level&#13;
budgets are conveniently available altogether at the end. The budget is also presented in a multi-year&#13;
context to allow the Council to see how the budget compares not only to the past but also what is foreseen&#13;
for FY10 and FY11 budget allocations, if sufficient programmatic funding is available.&#13;
&#13;
FY09 is a transitional year for WSP funding. There are several key trust funds which have recently&#13;
closed or will soon close, and successor funding is not yet in place. There are different reasons for the&#13;
lapses, but the result is that less of this funding can be included in the planning envelopes for FY09. In&#13;
addition to cash-flow issues, there is a real reduction in resources for the on-going program, with the&#13;
imminent closing of one major thematic trust fund that will not be renewed. This trust fund has provided&#13;
substantial support to the country and regional programs in enhancing the role of domestic private sector&#13;
providers in WSS. The work has been mainstreamed but is now vying for the same very limited core&#13;
funding as other parts of the program.&#13;
&#13;
WSP's FY09 budget is set initially at USD 53.1 million. It currently has a funding gap of $3 million in&#13;
global core funding. The envelope was based on both funds under agreement and WSPâ&#128;&#153;s best estimate of&#13;
the funding pipeline expected to be under agreement in the first half of the year at the time of budget&#13;
preparation. Some expectations in the pipeline have since changed. WSP will follow up closely with&#13;
donors on agreements in the pipeline during the first quarter of the fiscal year. As is usual practice, at&#13;
mid-year the budget will be revised to reflect the most recent funding information. If the funding gap&#13;
remains, the impact on the business plan will be outlined at mid-year after a careful consideration of&#13;
options. WSP hopes this scenario can be avoided as global core funding is critical to Africaâ&#128;&#153;s work&#13;
program, while also funding high priority activities in the other regions.&#13;

* The funding gap is a high level calculation that assumes current funding will roll over even if&#13;
agreements are coming to an end in the next two years, unless there is clear information to the contrary. It&#13;
also assumes the gap will be met with global core funding, which can be flexibly allocated as needed. The&#13;
increase year-on-year relates to the aspirational scaling up the program to strategically support country&#13;
efforts to meet the MDGs. The funding gap calculations will be reviewed and updated at mid-year.&#13;
&#13;
Despite the overall budget being almost 10% higher than FY08, the trend is uneven. Africaâ&#128;&#153;s budget&#13;
is marginally down from FY08 being particularly affected by the changeover in trust funds. (This is&#13;
the scenario even assuming the FY09 global core funding gap will be bridged.) In Latin America the&#13;
budget is down 9%, in comparison to FY08, for most of the same reasons as Africa. Africa and Latin&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                           FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
America have both responded by scaling back the regional part of the program, softening the impact on&#13;
WSPâ&#128;&#153;s engagement in focus countries.&#13;
&#13;
Funding for other regions is expected to be steadier for FY09. The budget is South Asia is currently&#13;
projected to remain steady. East Asia is projected to grow and is particularly scaling up in the Mekong.&#13;
The overall East Asia budget level should not be directly compared with other regions, however, because&#13;
it includes a substantial amount of funding for a specific program WSP is implementing on behalf of&#13;
Indonesia. The global level is also selectively increasing the budget for well-advanced flagships coming&#13;
out of the Global Practice Teams, and for the impact evaluation component of the global learning projects&#13;
on Hand washing and Total Sanitation and Sanitation Marketing.&#13;
&#13;
The Program will monitor the funding situation closely in the next few months and either reduce or&#13;
increase the funding envelopes at mid-year depending on developments. With this calculated but&#13;
watchful approach WSP seeks to reduce disruption to the program during this transitional period.&#13;
&#13;
Looking forward, WSP has prepared aspirational FY10 and FY11 planning figures. These show how&#13;
WSP will strategically allocate its resources if sufficient funding is available. There is currently a funding&#13;
gap of around $30 million for FY10 and FY11, three-quarters of it in the Africa region.&#13;
&#13;
The planning is prioritized both across and within regions. WSP will prioritize funding for the&#13;
regions with the most significant risk of reaching the MDGs. Re-establishing the core presence and&#13;
scaling up the work program will be the first priority in sub-Saharan Africa, the region furthest behind in&#13;
making progress toward the MDG targets in the sector. As second priority, WSP will increase funding to&#13;
scaling up WSP's contribution to global and regional knowledge, especially in South Asia and selected&#13;
countries in East Asia, where MDG gaps are also considerable.&#13;
&#13;
Within regions, WSP generally plans to give more focus to fragile states, and selectively scale down&#13;
work in some middle income countries, especially where funding is flexible enough to be reallocated&#13;
elsewhere. While in the short run, this is a pragmatic approach, it is expected that in the long run, there&#13;
are some real learning opportunities to low income countries from WSPâ&#128;&#153;s engagement in middle income&#13;
countries. WSP will look for opportunities to engage strategically in middle income countries in the long&#13;
run. In the same vein, the regional programs will also grow if sufficient programmatic funding is&#13;
available. This part of the program is important to both support and build regional knowledge from&#13;
country level work but has tended to be under-funded.&#13;

REGIONAL STRATEGY&#13;
The Challenge: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is facing an endemic water and sanitation crisis that&#13;
debilitates and kills in large numbers, limiting economic growth, educational access, and life&#13;
opportunities. Most at risk are the poor, particularly women and children, in rural areas and Africaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
growing informal settlements. The 2008 Joint Monitoring Program preliminary report shows that SSA is&#13;
the region furthest behind meeting the WSS MDGs and has the lowest levels of access to both water&#13;
supply and sanitation at 58% and 31%, respectively.2 Levels of sanitation access actually declined&#13;
between 1990 and 2000 and are the lowest figures amongst the world's developing regions. Based on&#13;
recent trends, 44% of SSA countries are not on track to meet the water MDGs and 85% of SSA countries&#13;
are not on track to meet the sanitation MDGs. It is estimated that an additional 47 million and 78 million&#13;
people would need to be served each year to meet the water and sanitation MDGs respectively. Unless&#13;
progress towards these goals is accelerated, some estimates show that SSA will only reach the water&#13;
MDG target in 2040 and the sanitation MDG target in 2076.&#13;

&#13;
The 2006 Country Status Overview of WSS in 16 Sub-Saharan countries estimated the minimum level of&#13;
public investment requirements for water and sanitation to meet the MDGs at US$1.2 billion and US$0.3&#13;
billion respectively per year for these countries. These fall short by US$0.6 billion per year for water and&#13;
US$0.2 billion for sanitation against planned public financing flows to the sector per year. Based on these&#13;
figures, a very rough lower-bound estimate of the financing gap for SSA would be US$1.6 billion per&#13;
year for water and sanitation3. Increased funding to the sector and moving towards more sustainable and&#13;
innovative forms of financing and developing approaches for ensuring sustainability of services are thus&#13;
crucial components of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s Africa strategy.&#13;
&#13;
Lack of capacity for improved service delivery is a critical constraint on MDG achievement. Capacity is&#13;
not only a function of availability of technical skills, finance, and human resource management, but is&#13;
also directly related to the performance incentives in sector institutions. Capacity increases frequently&#13;
follow from reform, greater use of the private sector, and strategic decentralization, all of which will&#13;

&#13;
remain key components of the strategy for Africa. The WSS MDG roadmaps and action plans to resume&#13;
and accelerate the development of WSS services serve as a powerful planning tool that helps clarify&#13;
institutional roles in the context of decentralization and identify capacity building needs to expand and&#13;
improve service delivery. WSP-AF will continue to work with clients and partners to formulate these&#13;
roadmaps and also provide strategic support in the implementation of such action plans.&#13;
Furthermore, the sizable number of African countries that are either steeped in, or emerging from&#13;
conflicts and political turmoil also pose a great challenge for WSS service delivery in SSA.&#13;
Development partners and regional bodies are increasingly recognizing the importance of addressing the&#13;
special needs of these fragile states, which account for more than 30% of SSAâ&#128;&#153;s population. WSP-AF will&#13;
actively engage in fragile states focusing on developing roadmaps and initiating dialogue on institutional&#13;
reforms.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Role: In the last few years, WSP-AF has focused its efforts on developing MDG roadmaps to&#13;
accelerate the development of water and sanitation services, implementing sector reform to support&#13;
capacity development for national and regional policy makers, and financing strategies to stimulate&#13;
investments towards meeting WSS MDGs in focus countries. As an honest broker, WSP-AF is well&#13;
placed to facilitate coordination and consensus building. Its multi-lingual field-based network promotes&#13;
knowledge sharing across Africa and beyond. It is on hand to coach clients through reform programs,&#13;
create leverage from local partnerships, and bring grass-root level experience to global attention. As part&#13;
of its learning and knowledge generation efforts, the Program has been piloting new approaches to&#13;
improving WSS service delivery through the engagement of the domestic private sector in rural, small&#13;
towns, and peri-urban areas. This is resulting in lessons that are feeding into policy formulation and&#13;
development within the region and beyond. WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s link with the Bank enhances its visibility and&#13;
provides opportunities to influence sector policies and large scale investments. All of these efforts are&#13;
ultimately aimed to increase political will and stimulate investments in the WSS sector.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, sanitation, up to now the most neglected MDG target, has been given much needed impetus by&#13;
the recent AfricaSan +5 regional ministerial conference (Durban 2008) which also launched the&#13;
International Year of Sanitation in Africa. As the organizer and convener of the event, WSP is playing an&#13;
instrumental role in sector leadership and coordination to help push sanitation at the top of the policy and&#13;
reform agenda. The eThekweni Declaration, the main output of the conference is set to be adopted at the&#13;
AU Heads of State on WSS that will take place in Egypt in June/Jul 2008.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: Over its thirty-year history, WSP has evolved into a market-leading,&#13;
field-based learning and policy facilitation network, supported through a partnership of the world's&#13;
leading development agencies; each committed to helping Africa reach the MDGs. WSP-AF is&#13;
recognized as a leading source of applied research and expertise on WSS policy and practices. It has a&#13;
field presence in 12 focus countries led by country coordinators who are respected sector professionals&#13;
supported by local experts and experienced sector specialists, most of whom are based in WSP-AF hubs&#13;
in Nairobi or Dakar. Through its thematic work, WSP-AF seeks to develop new and comparative bodies&#13;
of knowledge in areas that are judged most likely to assist achieving the WSS MDGs. Thematic support&#13;
to countries is consolidated within the framework of national action plans to meet the WSS MDGs, whilst&#13;
specific country support is focused on neglected sector components, such as rural water supply, sanitation&#13;
and hygiene services to the urban poor, and sector finance.&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-Africaâ&#128;&#153;s regional program operates across Eastern, Southern, Central&#13;
and West Africa, focusing on 12 countries, which are: Benin, Burkina Faso, DRC, Ethiopia, Kenya,&#13;
Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The majority of WSP-AF support goes directly to its country support programs. These take up about&#13;
75% of the operational budget. The selection criteria for WSP-AF focus countries take into account&#13;
countries that display the greatest need, particularly fragile states, the greatest reform potential (poor&#13;
countries committed to sector reform in which WSP-AF can make a difference) and the greatest learning&#13;
potential (countries with greatest potential for gaining highly relevant knowledge transfer). WSPâ&#128;&#147;AF has&#13;
established a field office in each focus country and, through them, supports implementation of its support&#13;
strategy for Africa. This strategy depends largely on the maturity of sector reform and involves:&#13;
&#13;
1. Intensifying core support to focus countries, mainly by providing implementation support (e.g.,&#13;
design of WSS programs, development of implementation tools such as manuals, local WSS plans),&#13;
capacity building for planning and implementation; development of SIMS, supporting supervision of&#13;
WSS operations funded by donors and partners (bilateral donors, AFDB, the Bank, etc)&#13;
&#13;
2. Supporting the neglected sub-sectors in the focus countries, including sanitation particularly in&#13;
countries such as Uganda, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Rwanda, rural and small town water in countries such&#13;
as Benin, Senegal, Burkina, Zambia, Tanzania, and services to the urban poor, especially in Kenya;&#13;
&#13;
3. Developing practical tools and knowledge on ways of engaging the domestic private sector,&#13;
promoting sanitation and hygiene and developing innovative financing strategies. Examples of tools&#13;
include contracts for local private sector management of small town and rural water supply systems,&#13;
business development services, project development tools,&#13;
&#13;
4. Strengthening regional partnerships and networks, such as AMCOW, AfDB, EUWI, UN, AWOP,&#13;
ITN, and RWSN. For instance, WSP provides advocacy and best practice information to the African&#13;
Ministerial Council on Water (AMCOW); including direct staff support to the AMCOW President) and&#13;
will provide focused support in the follow up of Africasan, and the African Development Bank (AfDB)&#13;
and AWF where WSP-AF maintains a liaison office since early 2007.&#13;
&#13;
5. Developing approaches for fragile/post-conflict states, which will draw on WSP experience in&#13;
Rwanda, Lao PDR, Cambodia, and most recently DRC. Countries selected for support during FY09-11&#13;
would possibly include: Liberia, Sierra Leone, Burundi and Angola. WSP-AF may also respond to&#13;
demands for ad-hoc support to other post-crisis countries, e.g. Zimbabwe, Guinea etc. Work in selected&#13;
fragile states will include developing roadmaps and initiating dialogue on institutional reform and&#13;
supporting design and implementation of pilot projects.&#13;
&#13;
6.      WSP-AF will also intervene in other non-crisis countries either as strategic entry points to&#13;
stimulate reform or investment (Mali, Malawi, Congo-Brazzaville), or where there are significant&#13;
opportunities to learn. WSP will also review possibilities of increasing the number of focus countries in&#13;
response to client demands that have continued recently and in particular, during the recent RAC&#13;
(May08).&#13;
&#13;
7.      In addition, WSP-AF will revive the Rural Team focused on Rural and Small Town WSS&#13;
Services to pursue sustainable approaches for RWSS programs, including delegated management through&#13;
local PPP, funding mechanisms, and policies and practices to (i) scale up services through programmatic&#13;
approaches, (ii) support self-supply, (ii) take into account the productive water use in investment&#13;
planning, and, (iii) foster the emergence of effective country based drilling capacity.&#13;

&#13;
BENIN&#13;
The Challenge: Poverty reduction remains a central challenge in Benin. As a consequence of&#13;
prioritization of Rural water supply by GoB and development partners, coverage in rural areas is&#13;
relatively high, i.e., 53%. Although the prospects for sustainability appear better than in the rest of Africa,&#13;
the supply chains for hand pumps parts and repairing services need to be strengthened for more reliability.&#13;
Several measures are in line to substantially increase investment in the water sector and to mobilize donor&#13;
matching funds: first, to build a strong linkage between WSS SIMS and budget allocation processes; and,&#13;
second: to improve the effectiveness and rate of execution of the budget in compliance with public&#13;
finance management rules and procedures.&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, rural sanitation coverage, at 15%, is significantly below the African average. Severe&#13;
capacity constraints limit the potential for scaled up progress toward the WSS/MDGs in the hygiene and&#13;
sanitation sector. Under the recently implemented policy for the decentralization of services to&#13;
municipalities which, although endowed with appropriate legal powers, do not have the necessary&#13;
capacity and experience, significant capacity building support is needed.&#13;
&#13;
Far-reaching reforms in urban WSS have been initiated by the unbundling of water and electricity into&#13;
separate utilities. The newly established SONEB (SocietÃ© Nationale des Eaux du Benin) needs support in&#13;
particular for handling waste water and sanitation in partnership with municipalities, communities and&#13;
private operators.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: The challenge of the MDGs requires an acceleration of the coverage of both&#13;
sanitation and water supply. The GoB is developing a MDG action plan under the framework of the PRSP&#13;
process. The scale-up action plan will include a three-year budget and improvement targets for key&#13;
indicators.&#13;
The main opportunities for sector engagement are as follows:&#13;
Â&#131; A well established PRSP process that provides a proper framework for scaling up strategies and for&#13;
   the adoption of programmatic approaches;&#13;
Â&#131; The acceleration of the decentralization process which requires a coherent strategy for large scale&#13;
   capacity building and knowledge transfer from central institutions to local governments;&#13;
Â&#131; The countryâ&#128;&#153;s commitment to the WSS MDGs has raised the profile of the WSS sector, especially for&#13;
   sanitation; and,&#13;
Â&#131; The growing consensus on sector priorities among sector stakeholders facilitates coordination.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Role: WSP-AF has been operational in Benin for more than 10 years, mainly in investment&#13;
support for rural water development. Since 2004 WSP-AF has established a country presence to&#13;
strengthen its role in sector support. The focus of WSP support will continue to be on helping Benin:&#13;
Â&#131;   to implement a strategy to reach the MDGs, specifically focusing on the water services for rural&#13;
    communities and small towns and low-income peri-urban areas.,&#13;
Â&#131;   to enhance WSS Coordination, including technical assistance to strengthen the effectiveness&#13;
    of RWS public budget execution&#13;
Â&#131;   to develop with the other partners a nationwide Hand Washing (HW) marketing and communication&#13;
    campaign for childrenâ&#128;&#153;s caregivers and poor children (age 5 to 9) based on the adoption of&#13;
    appropriate HW behavior at critical times&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF has developed a well established collaboration with lead&#13;
sector agencies and with Beninâ&#128;&#153;s development partners involved in WSS the WB (through AFTU2)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      22&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                         FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DANIDA, GTZ (Germany), Dutch Cooperation, AFD (France), DGCD (Belgium) and AFDB). WSP has a&#13;
long standing engagement in rural WSS focused on the development and subsequent updating of the RWSS&#13;
strategy. WSP support has also been directed at the full integration of WSS in the PRSP and in the new WB&#13;
CAS. WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s work on WSS in PRSP initiatives and support for programmatic approaches has created&#13;
interest from the GoB and increased demand for WSP-AF support. The GoB wishes WSP-AF to maintain its&#13;
engagement in RWSS and to extend its support to urban WSS.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Activity Selection: During FY09-11, WSP-AF will focus its operations in four areas:&#13;
1. Support to GoB to implement WSS MDG strategies with focus on: (i) the development and roll-out a&#13;
   toolkit for delegated management of small piped systems in small towns; and (ii) the implementation&#13;
   of WSS strategies for urban areas with other donors broadening WSP ongoing support for a WSS&#13;
   strategy for low-income peri-urban areas and Urban Waste Water Sanitation Plan.&#13;
2. Assisting GoB to ensure the WSS Coordination particularly in the implementation of a WSS&#13;
   decentralized SIMS pilot project combined with the implementation a communication action plan for&#13;
   the RWS sector&#13;
3. support GoB to develop Hand Washing Marketing programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BURKINA FASO&#13;
The Challenge: Currently, 8 million (62.5 %) of Burkina Fasoâ&#128;&#153;s 12.9 million people have access to&#13;
improved water while 1.4 million (11%) have access to improved sanitation. Given the current rate of&#13;
population growth, to achieve the MDG by 2015, 5.8 million more people would need to obtain access to&#13;
water and 7.9 million to sanitation, a total of 12.85 million inhabitants. This will require an increase in&#13;
capacity of two times for water supply and more than six times for sanitation. Burkina Faso has a&#13;
substantial challenge to reach the MDG targets and a formal strategy and action plan for achieving them&#13;
was adopted by the Government in December 2006. Burkina Faso has initiated a process of&#13;
decentralization. Local water supply systems remain poorly developed and sector capacity is extremely&#13;
weak at the local government level. Critical challenges are to improve the sanitary environment in the&#13;
main and smaller towns and respond to the new decentralized context for service provision.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities and WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Roles: The Government of Burkina Faso (GoBF) initiated a reform&#13;
process in the sector beginning in 1990, but needs help in developing and implementing plans to meet the&#13;
MDGs. Building on the World Bank (WB) assisted Country Action Plan (CAP) for the water and&#13;
sanitation sector, WSP-AF has helped develop the WSS MDG strategy and action plan. WSP-AF has also&#13;
been requested by the World Bank (AFTU2) to support the development of the sanitation component of a&#13;
new investment program under preparation for six small towns, and the GoBF requested WSP-AF to&#13;
support the development of a program budget for the WSS sector, especially in the development of a&#13;
financing model and an M&amp;E system to track the WSS MDG targets. A joint WB-WSP mission to&#13;
Burkina Faso, under the overall framework of the PRSC, has helped mainstream WSS in the new poverty&#13;
reduction strategy with a specific focus on sanitation in urban and rural settlements.&#13;
A national WSS MDG coordination committee has been operational since July 2005. The external&#13;
support agencies have also created a development partnersâ&#128;&#153; group to harmonize and coordinate their&#13;
interventions. WSP will support the national coordination committee and the development partnersâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
group. Other strong in-country partnerships are with Denmark, Sweden, Holland, EU, Germany, France,&#13;
Switzerland, Belgium, and Japan, AfDB, Arabic Funds. : WSP-AF has supported the WSS MDG&#13;
roadmap in close collaboration with DANIDA within the framework of the development partnersâ&#128;&#153; group.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF has had a decade of engagement in activities supporting&#13;
Burkina Fasoâ&#128;&#153;s authorities, and has experience and credibility in the sector. WSP-AF pioneered&#13;
participatory development activities and has extended this engagement to a wide variety of areas. There&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    23&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                          FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
is strong collaboration with the government at both central and decentralized levels. As Burkina is now&#13;
well established as a focus country with in-country presence, WSP-AF is well positioned to respond to&#13;
client demand for support in sector reform and sector coordination, sanitation, financing and monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-AF country work program for Burkina will include support&#13;
in the following areas:&#13;
&#13;
1. Sector coordination, the implementation and monitoring of the WSS MDG roadmap and the PN-&#13;
     AEPA,&#13;
2. The new decentralization policy; e.g. to help selected municipalities to improve their capacity to&#13;
     design, implement, and supervise pro-poor strategies for environmental sanitation and water supply&#13;
     under local WSS MDG action plan;&#13;
3. Develop delegated management models to help ONEA and DGRE increase WSS services access to&#13;
     poor HH in peri urban, small tows and rural areas&#13;
4. Market Finance for urban and small towns WSS services delivery&#13;
5. Implementation of Communication Strategy for the WSS sector&#13;
6. Follow-up to AfricaSan+5, including the development of Hand Washing and Sanitation Marketing&#13;
Initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO&#13;
The Challenge: Access to and quality of WS services have regressed since the early â&#128;&#152;90s due to lack of&#13;
investment, institutional decay and rising poverty. Although there are no reliable sector data, the PRSP&#13;
estimates of coverage, 26 % for access to safe water and 46% for use of hygienic sanitation, are believed&#13;
to be close to reality. DRC needs in WSS are immense and have to be tackled in a context of systemic&#13;
institutional weakness and lack of support services (enterprises, banking, transport, etc.). Initial steps&#13;
along the arduous path of rehabilitation and development are being taken by humanitarian initiatives and,&#13;
more importantly, by large emergency multi-sectoral rehabilitation programs funded by World Bank&#13;
grants and credits and administered by dedicated project execution agencies. Structural reform of&#13;
REGIDESO, the national urban water utility, is supported by a Bank-funded PEs reform program.&#13;
&#13;
The PRSP rates lack of access to safe water among the four prime determinants of poverty and is founded&#13;
on the principles of community empowerment. The PRSP and the related investment program estimate&#13;
that the WSS/MDGs would call for increasing from 14 to 42 million the number people with access to&#13;
safe water. This would not only require investment in excess of US$ 2 billion but would also depend on&#13;
substantial reforms to increase efficiency and to mobilize and develop additional capacity. The medium-&#13;
term challenge is to foster the transition from emergency to sector programs based on coherent strategies.&#13;
The immediate challenges are: (i) to ensure that the large scale rehabilitation projects now reaching&#13;
completion in main cities are accompanied by the institutional and financial measures needed to ensure&#13;
that they actually result in service improvement and expansion and do reach the poor; and, (ii) to build&#13;
sector pilot programs to support local initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: The recommendations of the Round Table on Infrastructure (Oct. 2004) provide a&#13;
sound starting point to guide the transition to coherent sectoral programs driven by service objectives and&#13;
to initiate sectoral coordination directed not only at investment plans but also at sector policies and&#13;
institutional strategies. While there is no clear perception of how the water sector should be structured in&#13;
the future, there is widespread acceptance of the need to undertake structural reform along two main axes:&#13;
(i) to decentralize responsibilities; and, (ii) to open the sector to a broader range of actors including&#13;
private operators, CBOs, NGOs, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    24&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                        FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Govt will seek to conclude a management contract with a professional operator to implement the first&#13;
phase of the reform and institutional and financial rehabilitation of the REGIDESO, the national urban&#13;
water utility.&#13;
The Govt with ADB funding, will soon launch the preparation of a country-wide program for rural WSS&#13;
(PNAER) which will be DRCâ&#128;&#153;s de facto WS/MDGs Roadmap for RWSS.&#13;
WSP-AF engagement in DRC: WSP-AF engagement in DRC was initiated by the WUP-sponsored&#13;
seminar on WS sector reform (Oct. 2003) which led to demand for WSP to facilitate the water sector&#13;
aspects of the Infrastructure Round Table. WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s medium-term program is based on the three lines of&#13;
action prioritized by the Round Table: (i) to redress REGIDESO performance and launch structural&#13;
reform of the urban WS sub-sector; (ii) to support local initiatives; and (iii) to strengthen sectoral&#13;
coordination.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AF comparative advantage: Through its role in strategy development and learning events at the&#13;
early stages of the drive to resume the development of the WSS sector, WSP-AF has gained the&#13;
confidence of key sector agencies and donors in particular EU, AFD, GTZ/KFW. WSP-AF is seen as a&#13;
vehicle to re-connect DRC sector professionals and institutions with regional and global knowledge&#13;
networks. Finally, in a context where donors are seeking to engage (or re-engage) in the WSS sector,&#13;
WSP-AF is seen as an objective source of strategic advice. The strong synergy developed with the WB&#13;
through AFTU2 has allowed WSP to help develop the pro-poor aspects of WB operations (PURUS under&#13;
implementation, PEMU scheduled for appraisal first semester FY09).&#13;
WSP-AF Activity Selection, three-year perspective: WSP-AF program for the next three years will focus&#13;
on four objectives:&#13;
- Help map out the transition to coherent sector development programs aiming at the WSS/MDGs&#13;
- Strengthen sectoral coordination and knowledge dissemination and networking&#13;
- Help prepare and implement programs to support local community-based WSS initiatives; and,&#13;
- Support the reform of urban water supply services with particular focus on pro-poor aspects&#13;
&#13;
ETHIOPIA&#13;
The Challenge: Lack of access to water and sanitation facilities and poor hygiene practices are identified&#13;
as major causes of morbidity and mortality in Ethiopia, and significantly hinder the achievement of the&#13;
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). To address the problem the government of Ethiopia has, in its&#13;
Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP), adopted a Universal Access&#13;
Plan (UAP) based on low-cost technology options with the aim of achieving close to 100% coverage for&#13;
both sanitation and water by the year 2012. Thus Ethiopia has effectively replaced the MDG WSS targets&#13;
with its WSS UAP. Impressive improvements have already been made over the last three to four years&#13;
and water and sanitation coverage has on average increased across Ethiopia from 31% and 13% in 2000&#13;
to 47% and 50% respectively in 2008. To meet the UAP targets an additional 53 million people would&#13;
need to be provided with access to safe water and an additional 51 million people would need to gain&#13;
access to sanitation services by 2012 (2012 population 91 million).The challenge is how to further scale&#13;
up the recent gains made and achieve the UAP targets of 100 % coverage by 2012.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: This clear commitment by the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) to the UAP, although&#13;
highly ambitious, provides a real opportunity to develop a clear and realistic regional planning framework&#13;
that aligns and accelerates existing plans towards achieving the targets of UAP. In addition, the ongoing&#13;
multi-stakeholders Forum country dialogue among GoE and development partners and the clear&#13;
commitment of donors to further harmonize and increase their support to the sector (DFID has only&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   25&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                          FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
recently, Dec. 2007, allocated 70 million Pounds Sterling) has created further opportunities to increase&#13;
resources for the realization of the UAP and to move towards a SWAP approach in the sector..&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Role: WSP-AF has strengthened its presence and operations in Ethiopia. Initially WSP played&#13;
a leading role in supporting the Ministry of Water Resources in policy and strategy development,&#13;
primarily in water. Over the past four years, with the evolution of the program, WSP-AF shifted the&#13;
focus of its operations to practical support for hygiene and sanitation (H&amp;S) and provided support to&#13;
strengthen sector coordination, policy development, preparation of national H&amp;S roadmaps as well as&#13;
mainstreaming of H&amp;S strategy and guidelines. With the new WASH structure, agreed between&#13;
development partners and GoE, WSP-AF will shift its support to the implementation of the agreed&#13;
WASH Structures at federal, regional and woreda levels and mainstreaming of the SWAP approach in the&#13;
sector including development and implementation of a National WASH M&amp;E/MIS systems, eventually&#13;
leading to a robust sector information monitoring systems (SIMS).&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF has had a strong presence in Ethiopia for many years and&#13;
has supported the water and sanitation sector since the mid-90s, working both in strategy and policy&#13;
development in WSS. WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s support has been provided through consultation with regional states,&#13;
federal ministries, donors, NGOs, CSOs, user groups, and other sector development partners and&#13;
institutions resulting in a close working relationship between clients, partners, and sector stakeholders.&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s flexibility to respond to emerging needs of the country and its emphasis on H&amp;S represent its&#13;
positive attributes.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Activity Selection: Working closely with the GoE, WB, AfDB, UNICEF, the&#13;
Government of Finland, USAID and other development partners, WSP-AF will work within the&#13;
framework of the National WASH program and the WSS UAP and will focus on the following activities:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   Support the Regional states to establish and operationalize the recently agreed WASH Coordination&#13;
    Structures and move to a sector-wide approach,&#13;
â&#128;¢   Support the design and development of a National WASH M&amp;E/MIS and its implementation by the&#13;
    federal and regional sector institutions,&#13;
â&#128;¢   Support to Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s Millennium H&amp;S Movement and the launch of EthioSan (Ethiopiaâ&#128;&#153;s response&#13;
    to adopt the AfricaSan Action Agenda) at federal and regional levels,&#13;
â&#128;¢   Supporting the regional states to catalyze the â&#128;&#156;At-Scaleâ&#128;? implementation of the National H&amp;S&#13;
    Strategy and protocol including tailored capacity building for at scale H&amp;S promotion&#13;
â&#128;¢   Complement the H&amp;S promotional efforts with sanitation marketing and hand washing programs&#13;
â&#128;¢   Supporting the development of an H&amp;S strategy for urban centers and smalls towns&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KENYA&#13;
The Challenge: The water and sanitation sector in Kenya is facing enormous challenges. The sector is&#13;
currently undergoing reforms to implement the Water Act 2002 to achieve the MDGs. Nationally, access&#13;
to safe water is currently estimated at 62%, while access to basic sanitation is at 43%. This translates into&#13;
13 million Kenyans without access to water and 19 million people without access to basic sanitation. The&#13;
realistic achievement of the MDGs in the field of Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) requires a strong&#13;
financial, technical and conceptual support through (i) an enhanced sector-wide and programmatic&#13;
approaches and integration of these to ensure greater impact on reducing poverty; (ii) promotion of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     26&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                         FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
poverty-oriented economic growth, among others through enhanced community-based and private sector&#13;
participation; and (iii) mobilization of additional financial resources for investment in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: To help steer the reforms and guide the implementation of the Water Act 2002, the&#13;
Ministry has established autonomous water service institutions as well as a semi-autonomous Water&#13;
Services Trust Fund. The second annual sector conference and joint sector review was held in October&#13;
2007. The annual sector conference and review together with the functioning water sector working and&#13;
technical groups form the key SWAP aspects which all ensure harmonization in the sector. All Reforms&#13;
continue to be deepened through exploring options for private sector participation in the major cities and&#13;
seeking to respond to the new expectations in the country. These options include the Output Based Aid&#13;
approach which has seen the entry of micro-enterprise and market micro â&#128;&#147;finance institutions in the&#13;
sector. The availability of more subsidy funds for OBA projects gives a unique opportunity for the&#13;
accelerate progress in coverage and sustainability of water supply services for rural communities and&#13;
small towns. In addition the Ministry has seen an increase in budgetary allocations rise over the over the&#13;
last financial year by an average of 8% in recurrent and development expenditure. The recently approved&#13;
World Bank Water and Sanitation Infrastructure Project (WaSSIP) covering 3 Water Service Board areas&#13;
presents an opportunity to increase coverage in poor regions especially in urban areas. This will be done&#13;
through supporting the development of pro poor polices for implementation through the investment&#13;
programs which together with increased public budget allocations creates an opportunity for scaling up&#13;
service provision and attaining the MDGs. Presently, all the new institutions are in place and operational.&#13;
The Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation (MPHS) was recently formed under the new coalition&#13;
government which creates an opportunity for sanitation coverage scale up in Kenya. The recently held&#13;
Afrisan 2008 conference to mark the International Year of Sanitation and ministerial statement will&#13;
inform the country action plan preparation.&#13;
.&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Role: WSP-AF played a key role during the Kenya Water and Sanitation Sector Review 2000,&#13;
and has been closely involved in the development of the new Water Act 2002, the WSS strategy, and the&#13;
WRM strategy. In addition WSP assisted in formulation of the Environmental Sanitation and Hygiene&#13;
Policy. In discussion with MWI and the MPHS, WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s roles are expected to be: i) support to the&#13;
coordination and WSS MDG planning processors, to facilitate support for the reform process; ii) ongoing&#13;
support to the implementation of sector reforms and support to the MWI, water boards and service&#13;
providers; iii) development of delivery mechanisms for WSS in informal settlements and&#13;
preparation of investment programs; and iv) process for the development and implementation of&#13;
national environmental sanitation and hygiene programs.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF has a strong track record in the sector and good working&#13;
relationships with leading agencies in Kenya. WSP-AF is regarded as an honest broker by the MWI and&#13;
other stakeholders, and is therefore expected to lead sector coordination activities among government,&#13;
donors, and other sector actors. This comparative advantage derives from: i) a strong regional&#13;
presence; ii) experience in similar reform projects in other countries, such as guiding sector reform in&#13;
Zambia and the development of sanitation policies in Burkina Faso, etc.; iii) WSP-AF success in&#13;
developing delivery mechanisms for WSS services to urban and rural poor; and iv) An in-country&#13;
presence and good understanding of the WSS issues in the country.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s work in Kenya will focus on four projects namely: (i)&#13;
Kenya WSS MDG Road Map (ii) Support to WSS Sector Reform Processes (iii) Development of a&#13;
strategy for WSS service provision in Informal Settlements, and (iv) Support the National Sanitation&#13;
Marketing and Hygiene Promotion.&#13;

MOZAMBIQUE&#13;
The Challenge: Mozambique is one of the 15 poorest countries in the world. National water supply and&#13;
sanitation coverage rates are both less than 50%, placing Mozambique below the African average.&#13;
Though recent economic growth rates have been favorable, structural weaknesses and lagging capacity at&#13;
all levels have hindered sector development. Despite high levels of investment and donor support,&#13;
sustainability remains elusive, with upwards of 50% water points non-functional in some provinces, and&#13;
unaccounted for water at more than 50% in most cities. Investments, 90% funded by donors, are still&#13;
delivered through a large number of poorly coordinated WSS projects rather than a coherent national&#13;
program. The recent decentralization involving the creation of municipal governments and the channeling&#13;
of investment funds through the provincial and district administrations, calls for profound reform of&#13;
sector planning and funding systems to adapt them to the needs of local authorities. This transition is&#13;
rendered all the more difficult by lagging institutional capacity, lack of data which and uncoordinated&#13;
planning and monitoring instruments.&#13;
The Opportunities: The country is currently prioritizing sustainable service delivery, alignment of&#13;
policies and programs under the framework of decentralization, and increased reliance on the private&#13;
sector. The existence of a stable delegated management framework for urban water supply, supported by&#13;
a progressive regulator concerned with the plight of the urban poor, constitutes a solid base for progress in&#13;
the urban and peri-urban sub-sectors. Key developments in the rural sub-sector include the development&#13;
of a SWAp and the move to establish a formal framework involving district authorities, private operators&#13;
and communities in maintaining point sources. There is also strong government backing for sanitation,&#13;
with an on-going national sanitation campaign and active engagement by the Minister for Public Works&#13;
and Housing in the follow-up to AfricaSan +5.&#13;
WSP-AF Role: WSP-AF is engaged in the above three area by: (1) facilitating sector coordination and the&#13;
MDGs roadmaps process and; (2) supporting related improvement in planning, budgeting, monitoring and&#13;
sector information systems; and, (3) facilitating networking and transfer of knowledge and experience to&#13;
develop capacities among public, private and civil society actors. .&#13;
WSP-AF Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF is perceived as a highly-experienced, honest broker with a&#13;
permanent in-country presence and the unique capacity to draw upon an international team of experts on a&#13;
range of issues. WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s is in the position to engage policy makers in open dialogue and give them the&#13;
confidence to launch necessary reform and focus on service access for the poor.&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Activity Selection&#13;
WSP-AF will support to the National Water Directorate (DNA) will focus on: (i) the preparation of WSS&#13;
MDG roadmaps by sub-sectors; (ii) the development and rolling out of the country-wide SIMS, building&#13;
upon existing initiatives and experiences, and responding to the evaluation needs within the national&#13;
Poverty Reduction Strategy; and, (iii) the adaptation and implementation of planning, budgeting and&#13;
reporting systems and tools under the framework of decentralization with necessary linkages with the&#13;
central public expenditure management system (SISTAFE and MTEF).&#13;
WSP-AF will continue to foster sector coordination by: (i) supporting the annual sector review process&#13;
providing secretariat services and consultancy support; and, (ii) continuing to participate in the WSS&#13;
Working Group (GAS) and related sub-groups and task forces.&#13;
WSP-AF engagement in capacity building will focus on: (i) supporting CFPAS (Professional Training&#13;
Center for Water and Sanitation) for the development of training courses for local authorities and private&#13;
sector actors for improved implementation and management of small-scale WSS project; (ii) fostering the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
emergence of a national drillersâ&#128;&#153; association and related capacity building activities; and, (iii) the&#13;
systematic strengthening of knowledge transfer activities through strategic partnerships with professional&#13;
institutions.&#13;
&#13;
NIGER&#13;
The Challenge: Niger is one the poorest countries in the world. Over 63% of the population lives under&#13;
the poverty line, and the country is just emerging from a 10-year political and social crisis. Poverty is&#13;
widespread in rural settlements. Currently, 7.3 million (59%) of Nigerâ&#128;&#153;s 12.4 million people have access&#13;
to water supply and 2.2 million (18%) have access to sanitation. To achieve the MDGs by 2015, 7 million&#13;
more people would need to obtain access to water and 8.5 million to sanitation. This would still leave 3.5&#13;
million without water and 7 million without proper sanitation. Currently, about 450 rural and 20 town&#13;
water supply systems are being constructed each year. To achieve the MDGs, the number of new systems&#13;
constructed each year would have to be doubled in rural areas and small towns, and more than tripled in&#13;
urban areas. WSP-AF has helped the Ministry of Water and Environment (MoHE) in charge of the water&#13;
sector develop a WSS MDG roadmap, which includes (i) the creation of a national WSS coordination and&#13;
consultative committee (NWSSC), (ii) the strengthening of the M&amp;E system, (iii) the development of&#13;
national WSS MDG strategy and action plan, (iv) the improvement of the WSS governance, and (v) the&#13;
development of an Integrated Water Resources Management strategy. The UWSS sub-sector is under&#13;
institutional reform with the support of the international community. An asset holding company (SPEN)&#13;
and a private operator (SEEN) are respectively in charge of investments and operations in the main urban&#13;
centers. The RWSS sub-sector remains the major challenge, despite the ongoing introduction of new pilot&#13;
management schemes in some rural provinces.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: The Government of Niger (GoN) is committed to pursuing the sector reform process&#13;
but needs help in developing coherent plans to meet the MDGs. The WB has assisted in developing a&#13;
CAP for the WSS sector. WSP-AF has helped develop the WSS MDG strategy and action plan&#13;
frameworks with support from a French CTF and has been requested to help the government develop a&#13;
national WSS MDG investment and action plan. WSP-AF has previously provided support to Niger from&#13;
regional staff in its Abidjan and Dakar offices. Recent additional support from Switzerland has enabled&#13;
WSP to open a country office in Niger and include the country as a focus country of its Africa operations.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Role: WSP-AF has supervised and completed the urban sanitation component of the WB&#13;
funded Water Sector Project, and is providing technical assistance for the development of management&#13;
contract models for small towns. Now a that Niger is a WSP focus country, WSP-AF will be increasing&#13;
the level of support offered with a focus on rural water supply, playing a role in strengthening sector&#13;
coordination, assisting to further develop and assist in the implementation of specific actions, including&#13;
strengthening sector monitoring and financing strategy, to improve Nigerâ&#128;&#153;s chances of reaching the WSS&#13;
MDGs. The focus will primarily be on facilitating Nigerâ&#128;&#153;s achievement of the MDG targets,&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF has had several years of engagement in activities&#13;
supporting Nigerâ&#128;&#153;s authorities, and has sub-regional experience and credibility in the sector. With&#13;
experiences gained in Senegal (urban water supply, sanitation, and hygiene), Benin (rural water supply&#13;
and sanitation), and DRC (sector reform and communication), WSP-AF is in a strong position to work&#13;
and support national and local governments in Niger improve the WSS sector performance and meet the&#13;
WSS MDGs.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Activity Selection:&#13;
The following specific activities will be the focus for WSP-AF in Niger:&#13;
1. Enhancement of the National WSS Sector Coordination;&#13;
2. Strengthening of the WSS MDG M&amp;E system (CSO) ;&#13;
3. Development of a national WSS MDG investmentâ&#128;&#147;based PRSP-Strategy and Action Plan;&#13;
4. Development of a communication strategy for the sector&#13;
&#13;
RWANDA&#13;
The Challenge: Despite the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s impressive progress, the challenges ahead are considerable.&#13;
After several years of slow but steady increases, water sector spending tripled in 2005 compared to 2004,&#13;
and increased by one third again in 2006, to about US$ 30 million. Access to clean water has increased by&#13;
an additional 600,000 people in both 2005 and 2006. The introduction of private participation into the&#13;
operation of piped, rural water supply systems has been an unprecedented success. The target of 20 % of&#13;
about 850 systems to be privately managed by November 2007 has been reached.&#13;
The WSS sector has established a policy framework for sector development and has begun to mobilize&#13;
donor support for WSS development, in particular through the second PRSP called EDPRS (Economic&#13;
Development for Poverty Reduction Strategy). Coordination of sector agencies remains a significant&#13;
challenge in the Framework of Monitor the EDPRS implementation. Under the AfDB sponsored RWSSI,&#13;
Rwanda has developed a comprehensive long-term program (PNEAR) to reach 100 % coverage in water&#13;
supply and sanitation by 2020 which would encompass the MDGs. If the MDG objectives are to be&#13;
reached, sector funding will need to be further increased to about US$ 32-35 million per year, and&#13;
maintained at that level until 2015. The PNEAR which is Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s de facto MDG Roadmap for Rural&#13;
WSS is being managed by a joint unit which is the precursor of a specialized structure to support rural&#13;
WSS development.&#13;
The Opportunities: The civil service in Rwanda is recovering at an encouraging pace and is better able to&#13;
use development assistance.         Demand-based project rules and procedures under the country&#13;
decentralization policy have been tested under the PAEMR (WB funded 2000-2007). Furthermore,&#13;
adequate technical support will need to be provided to districts to enable them to plan and implement&#13;
water and sanitation investment and to oversee the O&amp;M by local operators. Effective cost recovery and&#13;
private participation also will be necessary to ensure sector sustainability.&#13;
Rwanda has elevated Sanitation and Hygiene as a national priority and is committed to the AfricaSan&#13;
action plan. Hygiene promotion and education will need more effective methods and a higher degree of&#13;
institutional collaboration among the agencies concerned.&#13;
The reform of ELECTROGAZ (the joint power and water utility) and the increase in production capacity&#13;
(doubling from about 30,000 m3/day to about 70,000 m3/d) has opened up opportunities for extending&#13;
and improving services to poor HH in the periphery of Kigali.&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Role: WSP-AF was active in post-crisis activities in Rwanda from 1997 to 2001, and helped&#13;
to develop the sector policy and to prepare the PAEMR, and later to prepare the PRSP process and its&#13;
second generation called EDPRS. WSP-AF contributed also to urban sanitation issues and to hygiene&#13;
promotion (PHAST) and school sanitation in partnership with UNICEF. The relationship was interrupted&#13;
due to staff and resource constraints. Following the 2003 consultations with Belgium, WSP-AF main&#13;
funding partner for Rwanda, engagement was resumed, and Rwanda is prioritized as one of WSP focus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   30&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                          FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
countries. Since 2006 WSP-AF has deployed an experienced Country Sector Coordinator based in Kigali&#13;
to coordinate to WSP-AF work program and liaise with sector partners. GoR has requested WSP-AF to&#13;
support the sector coordination process, support the move towards adopting a more programmatic sector&#13;
approach in rural water supply, support the sanitation and hygiene sub-sectors and determine effective&#13;
ways of encouraging private sector participation in rural water supply development and management.&#13;
More recently WSP-AF has helped RURA, the multi-sector utility regulator, to develop a strategy to&#13;
improve access to safe water in for poor HH in Kigali.&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: WSP-AF is well established in Rwanda, now with more direct&#13;
engagement from its country office. WSP-AF has a close and consistent partnership with the World Bank&#13;
(AFTU2) and Belgium (DGDC) in supporting the rural water and sanitation sector. WSP-AF areas of&#13;
engagement have been defined in thorough consultations with lead sector agencies and key partners (in&#13;
particular WB, AfDB, EU, Belgium, ADA, UNICEF and DFID).&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Activity Selection:&#13;
WSP will help the Ministry in Charge of Water and Sanitation to implement critical aspects of its sector&#13;
policy:&#13;
Rural water supply. Under the PNEAR, WSP-AF activities will focus on: planning and funding&#13;
mechanisms for rural WS systems, capacity building for delegated management of rural WS systems and&#13;
related policy issues: tariff structure, accountability framework etc.&#13;
Hygiene and Sanitation. Continue to develop effective methods for hygiene promotion; assess sanitation&#13;
technology and related sludge disposal options for dense rural settlements, including implementation of&#13;
Pilot Project for ECOSAN. Help develop the sanitation strategy and the roadmap for the sanitation MDG&#13;
and EDPRS implementation.&#13;
Sector coordination. Support the emerging country coordination framework lead by EU for the&#13;
infrastructures sector; support the WSS coordination sub-cluster chaired by Ministry of Natural Resources&#13;
and co-chaired by AfDB, support the implementation &amp; monitoring of the WSS component of the&#13;
EDPRS. WSP-AF will respond to request for help in setting up a basket fund to streamline and harmonize&#13;
external assistance to the WSS sector.&#13;
Urban WSS services. WSP-AF will assist RURA and ELECTROGAZ in two areas: (i) pro-poor strategy&#13;
including standposts, social connections and tariff review; and, (ii) consumer voice and accountability.&#13;
&#13;
SENEGAL&#13;
The Challenge: Senegal has made substantial progress in the WSS sector coverage following the reforms&#13;
initiated in 1996: 2006 coverage rates are (i) for water supply 69% in rural areas and 98%in urban,&#13;
settlements (ii) for sanitation 17% in rural areas and 62% in urban settlements. In the urban water sector,&#13;
the challenge is to sustain and follow up these reforms. The first ten-year lease contract to SÃ©nÃ©galaise des&#13;
Eaux came to an end in April 2006 and was extended for 5 years. During this period, the challenge is to&#13;
evaluate, monitor and strengthen the PPP in the WSS sector and also develop a long term perspective of&#13;
providing safe water to Dakar area up to 2030. In RWSS, the government has previously financed&#13;
technically-sophisticated water systems, but the ongoing reforms (including new financing criteria and the&#13;
implementation of cost-recovery policies) are modifying the conditions in the management of the RWSS&#13;
systems. WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s support is requested to revise the maintenance policy and advice on rural PSP&#13;
options to enhance efficiency and sustainability. The government initiated the development of poor urban&#13;
sanitation strategy in 1996 and created a National Office of Sanitation Agency (ONAS). However, since&#13;
service coverage remains low for sanitation, the Government of Senegal (GoS) has requested WSP-AF&#13;
support to develop a national sanitation action plan and its implementation by scaling up sanitation&#13;
activities, developing sustainable financing mechanism and reinforcing capacity for the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     31&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                         FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: In the framework of the ongoing Senegal Long Term Water Sector Project, the&#13;
government has requested the support of the WB and WSP-AF to help the PRSP process better reflect the&#13;
rural water and sanitation sub-sectors in order to assist Senegal reach the WSS MDGs. The second&#13;
generation of reform will focus on RWSS. This assistance will involve reviewing the RWSS sector under&#13;
the overall framework of the MDG target for a better understanding of success factors related to financing&#13;
mechanisms, institutional arrangements, increased PSP and sustainable technological options, including&#13;
supply chains for RWSS maintenance. The GoSâ&#128;&#153; willingness to go on reforming the water sector,&#13;
especially in rural area gives WSP the opportunity to develop sustainable PSP in rural area. The strong&#13;
performance of the urban water sector following the 1996 reform, and the wide consensus around the&#13;
national WSS MDG roadmap and investment program provide knowledge resources and experiences for&#13;
sharing within the region to guide other countries accelerate WSS services delivery and meet the MDG&#13;
targets.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Role: In previous years, WSP-AF has supported activities in Senegal through its regional&#13;
thematic operations. An expanded program was developed in Senegal from 2004 to respond to additional&#13;
requests for support from the government and WB. WSP-AF is perceived as an honest broker, which can&#13;
facilitate policy dialogue and consensus building for sustainable strategies and programs in the previously&#13;
neglected rural and sanitation sub-sectors which are Senegalâ&#128;&#153;s critical challenges to attain the WSS&#13;
MDGs. Government has continuous requests to assist in monitoring the implementation of WSS MDG&#13;
action plans and sector coordination. WSP helped to promote a better coordination between donors and&#13;
reinforce the dialogue between all stakeholders in Senegal.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: With a significant regional presence of experienced international&#13;
staff based in Dakar, WSP-AF is well positioned to provide high level support to the ongoing reforms and&#13;
be a source of comparative learning for priority sector challenges. In particular, the WSP-AF Dakar team&#13;
includes specialists in RWS, sanitation and hygiene, and finance, which constitute areas of expertise&#13;
highly needed to advance the WSS agenda in Senegal. WSPâ&#128;&#153;s prior support to the Senegal Long Term&#13;
Water Sector Project and to the ongoing PEPAM project with a strong alignment with WB support to the&#13;
sector has given WSP credibility in the country.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-AF support to Senegal for the coming years will mainly&#13;
focus on assisting the country to implement and fine-tune its WSS policy and strategy to meet the MDG&#13;
targets. During FY09-11, WSP-AF will focus its support in four areas:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Support the engagement of the local private sector in the development and management of RWSS&#13;
    services,&#13;
â&#128;¢ Developing tools to implement and monitor WSS MDG strategy and action plans and support sector&#13;
    coordination,&#13;
â&#128;¢ Support the sector coordination to initiate joint sector yearly review, not only at a central level, but&#13;
    also at regional levels,&#13;
â&#128;¢ Develop and implement a sanitation action plan and provide support to reinforce the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TANZANIA&#13;
The Challenge: Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per capita income of&#13;
US$3404, or US$0.93 per day. It has a population of almost 40 million people, with approximately 20%&#13;
living in urban areas (and an estimated rate of urbanization of 6% per year).5 This puts extreme stress on&#13;

&#13;
provision of basic services in urban areas, but also emphasizes the significance of rural communities.&#13;
While the water sector has a number of active agents, the sanitation and hygiene sub-sector is poorly&#13;
supported. Sanitation coverage is poorly understood, with estimates ranging from 4 â&#128;&#147; 90% and good&#13;
hygiene practice estimates range from 4 â&#128;&#147; 18%. Urban sewerage ranges from 0 â&#128;&#147; 30%, leaving the vast&#13;
majority using on-site sanitation. Even with the high estimates, the expected health benefits are not&#13;
materializing - diarrheal incidence remains high at 13% and cholera is endemic - raising concerns about&#13;
the quality of sanitation. Additionally, sanitation and hygiene receive an insignificant amount of&#13;
government and donor funding, despite the high incidence of diarrheal morbidity and mortality. The water&#13;
sector has benefited recently from the launch of the national Water Sector Development Program&#13;
(WSDP), a 20-year SWAP, but additional support is needed in implementing and managing the SWAP,&#13;
including in pro-poor approaches, financial management, and beneficiary assessments.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: The Government of Tanzania (GoT) has undertaken an ambitious reform policy, the&#13;
National Strategy for Poverty Reduction and Growth (or MKUKUTA). It has adopted the MDG targets&#13;
and has launched the WSDP, a 20-year SWAP for the water sector under the Ministry of Water and&#13;
Irrigation (MoWI). The MoWI has dedicated resources for sanitation and hygiene. The MoHSW has&#13;
developed a draft National Environmental Health, Hygiene and Sanitation Strategy (NEHHSAS), and has&#13;
given sanitation a home in this Ministry. The MoHSW has also begun the process of developing a&#13;
national sanitation and hygiene policy. Additionally, 2008 is the International Year of Sanitation, which&#13;
has raised the profile of the sector, including a high-level delegation to the AfricaSan +5 conference in&#13;
Durban, South Africa.&#13;
&#13;
WSPâ&#128;&#153;s Role: WSP has been involved in Tanzania for many years, historically providing support from the&#13;
regional headquarters in Nairobi. Early support focused on development of the Rural and Urban Water&#13;
projects and helped GoT in investment and demonstration project design, sector networking and&#13;
knowledge sharing. In October 2005, WSP opened a country office in Tanzania to strengthen its in-&#13;
country support. The country office is carrying forward the sanitation and hygiene work â&#128;&#147; both national&#13;
and local â&#128;&#147; to complement World Bank activities as well as provide support to the ongoing WSP-Africa&#13;
regional activities. Specifically, the country office works on the following fronts:&#13;
    i)       scaling up rural sanitation,&#13;
    ii)      scaling up handwashing with soap,&#13;
    iii)     sector support&#13;
&#13;
WSPâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: WSP has experience in Tanzania and has developed close relationships&#13;
with the sector actors, including representatives from the government, NGO, and donor communities. In&#13;
sanitation, for 30 years, WSP has been conducting innovative work across the continent in developing&#13;
strategies and creating enabling environments for the small scale private sector as well as promoting&#13;
sanitation marketing. WSP is recognized as an objective knowledge broker who can bring many actors to&#13;
the table in order to reach a mutually acceptable resolution and can draw on global and regional resources&#13;
to bring the skills of its sector professionals to Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;
WSPâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Activity Selection: In FY08, WSP will be focusing on three projects to continue&#13;
strengthening its country presence in Tanzania:&#13;
 i)      Scaling Up Sanitation Coverage,&#13;
 ii)     Scaling Up Handwashing Behavior, and&#13;
 iii)    Sector Support&#13;

UGANDA&#13;
The Challenge: In Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s revised Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) and Sector Investment Plan&#13;
(SIP) the targets are 77% and 80% for safe water supply and sanitation, respectively. The current&#13;
coverage is 63% and 59% respectively. However, with a high population growth of 3.4%, increasing unit&#13;
costs, and stagnant financing levels, unless concerted efforts are made to ensure sustainable and increased&#13;
coverage, increase in facilities is likely to be countered by population growth, making the targets&#13;
unattainable. The SIP and Sector-Wide Approach to Planning (SWAp) are very supportive of the water&#13;
sub-sector and while challenges do exist, the issue of meeting water MDG and PEAP targets is being&#13;
closely addressed.&#13;
The situation is worse for sanitation, which falls under 3 different ministries that have many other&#13;
priorities. Sanitation challenges include: (i) lack of prioritization at various levels, (ii) financial&#13;
constraints, and (iii) insufficient human resource capacity. The latter affect Local Governments (LGs) as&#13;
well as national ministries and agencies which are not adequately equipped to offer policy and technical&#13;
guidance to LGs and other service providers. This is particularly the case for the Environmental Health&#13;
Division (EHD) of the Ministry of Health (MoH) â&#128;&#147; Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s lead agency for sanitation development â&#128;&#147;&#13;
due to inadequate capacity to project the strategic priority given to sanitation and hygiene promotion, and&#13;
to offer planning support to LGs.&#13;
The Opportunities: Uganda has achieved considerable progress in the provision of water services and has&#13;
committed itself to close the gap in sanitation and hygiene. The foundation of the advances made in water&#13;
services are: (i) political will for reform; (ii) coordinated planning and funding under the SWAp&#13;
framework and the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC; WB); and, (iii) commitment to continued&#13;
improvement and reform, to pursue efficiency and effectiveness and to reduce the Government burden.&#13;
Well established tools are in place for the coordination of external support and the periodic joint&#13;
evaluation of sector, performance, the Joint Water and Sanitation Sector Program Support (JWSSPS) for&#13;
2008-2012, and the annual joint GoU/Donors sector reviews to assess performance and set undertakings&#13;
for improvement.&#13;
An active National Sanitation Working Group (NSWG) has the potential of elevating the profile of&#13;
sanitation. At the policy level, improved sanitation and hygiene have been highlighted as priorities under&#13;
the PEAP and the Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP II). The preparation of the 5-year National&#13;
Development Plan (NDP) 2008-2012, which will replace the PEAP is yet another opportunity. The pro-&#13;
poor strategy and the anti-corruption strategy developed by Directorate of Water Development&#13;
(DWD)/Ministry of Water and Environment, the 10-year Improved Sanitation and Hygiene financing&#13;
strategy as well as the review of the institutional issues linked with sanitation and hygiene are other&#13;
opportunities which will continue to be explored. The International Year of Sanitation (IYS) (2008) and&#13;
the AfricaSan follow up action plans are other opportunities.&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Role: The GoU is proactively driving the development process in the sector. While many&#13;
development partners provide technical assistance at national level, WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s role will continue to assist&#13;
the GoU in the implementation of activities to meet the sector MDGs with focus on the sanitation sub-&#13;
sector which faces bigger challenges, both in the urban and rural areas. WSP will provide knowledge&#13;
support and will seek opportunities to share emerging lessons from Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s water and sanitation sector&#13;
experiences across the region.&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: Uganda is a long-standing WSP-AF focus country with a strong&#13;
country presence currently including three staff. WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s strong relationship with the GoU, DPs, and&#13;
NGOs and its continued support to EHD places it favorably to continue to facilitate and stimulate policy&#13;
dialogue and national coordination among the sanitation sub-sector players, and to support development&#13;
of an enabling framework. Furthermore, WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s regional learning experiences with sanitation, serving&#13;
the urban poor, scaling up approaches, and creating management models for WSS O&amp;M in small towns&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                             FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
can add value to the sector in Uganda. WSPâ&#128;&#153;s emerging leading role in innovative approaches such as&#13;
sanitation marketing, OBA, anti-corruption and handwashing campaigns activities is relevant as Uganda&#13;
offers a supportive environment and is open to innovations.&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Activity Selection: Country Themes&#13;
â&#128;¢ Sanitation: WSP-AF Uganda program will remain centered on sanitation and hygiene. WSP-AF will&#13;
  continue supporting the GoU (EHD) to be more responsive to the challenges in the sanitation sub-&#13;
  sector. WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s existing regional sanitation capacity will enhance the support given in Uganda.&#13;
  WSP-AF is a strong member of the NSWG (currently the chair). WSP-AF will support the enabling&#13;
  environment for sanitation and hygiene promotion and also support the implementation of the&#13;
  sanitation MDG roadmap.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Anti Corruption (AC): WSP-AF in collaboration with other stakeholders - in particular with&#13;
  Sweden (SIWI &amp; SIDA), WBI, Anti corruption Coalition of Uganda (ACCU)- will support the&#13;
  anticorruption activities in the sector. This will include support to the Water and Sanitation sub sector&#13;
  group on good governance as well as initiatives to improve governance/accountability&#13;
â&#128;¢ Rural water supply: WSP-AF will support as appropriate activities related to the promotion of self-&#13;
  supply in Uganda and activities of Cost effective boreholes, operation and maintenance under the&#13;
  Rural Water Supply Network.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZAMBIA&#13;
The Challenge: Zambia had a population of just under 10m in 2000, with an annual growth rate of about&#13;
2.4%. Taking 30% of the current population as served; approximately 8.2 million people will need to be&#13;
served by 2015 to reach the MDGs. To reach its MDG goals of 74% for water and 42% for sanitation,&#13;
Zambia needs to increase the annual number of people gaining access to water supply by 6 times and for&#13;
sanitation by 3 times. Since 1993, the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) has undertaken&#13;
institutional reforms of the water and sanitation sector resulting in the formation of 10 commercial water&#13;
utilities serving urban centers overseen by a regulator. However, much still needs to be done to improve&#13;
operational efficiency and to increase access to WSS services in the peri-urban areas where most of the&#13;
poor reside. For the rural areas, the government has since 2003, been engaged in defining mechanisms for&#13;
strengthening and streamlining the WSS functions within the local authorities. This has culminated in the&#13;
adoption of a new institutional framework for RWSS in 2004, and the preparation of a National Rural&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation Program (NRWSSP) which was launched in November 2007 and constitutes&#13;
de facto, Zambiaâ&#128;&#153;s MDG Roadmap for rural WSS. Zambia has the potential to meet the WSS MDGs, but&#13;
to do so, the following challenges must be addressed: (i) inadequate institutional and financial capacity in&#13;
both the local authorities as well as in the commercial utilities; (ii) lack of clarity in the institutional and&#13;
legislative arrangement; existence of several funding routes and mechanisms often with conflicting rules;&#13;
and, (iii) inadequate coordination amongst different donors, resulting in duplication of effort and aid&#13;
ineffectiveness in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: Opportunities for overcoming these challenges exist including; a progressive legal&#13;
and policy framework contained in the National Water Policy (1994), the Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
Act (1997), and the Decentralization Policy (2002). These, among others, provide for commercial&#13;
viability, for specific focus on un-served and poor communities and for the participation of different&#13;
service providers. The GRZ has also undertaken to developing a more effective institutional framework,&#13;
including government-led donor coordination and harmonization based on the Joint Assistance Strategy&#13;
for Zambia (JASZ; 2007). The JASZ process led to the creation of the Water Sector Advisory Group&#13;
(Water SAG) of which all cooperating partners (CP) including WSP-AF are members, and the MDG&#13;
Technical Committee with the mission to spearhead the MDG process, strengthen WSS issues in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      35&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                            FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PRSP and move toward a Sector Wide approach (SWAp). At the same time, CPs have agreed to&#13;
streamline their operations through the appointment of lead donors (DANIDA and Germany) to foster&#13;
policy dialogue and reduce transaction costs. For the rural sub-sector, the NRWSSP offers an opportunity&#13;
for stepped up resource mobilization under a harmonized framework. In the urban areas, institutional&#13;
reform and investment program financed by CP present an opportunity to leverage support to the under-&#13;
served residents of the peri-urban areas. The critical challenge is implementation. As the focus shifts to&#13;
the poor in both urban and rural settings, the GRZ needs support to define innovative approaches for&#13;
serving this large constituency, as this is where the MDG targets most apply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Role: Over the last 3 years, WSP has played a key role in the development of the NRWSSP.&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s role in Zambiaâ&#128;&#153;s rural sector will continue to focus on the NRWSSP with a shift toward&#13;
implementation issues. This will apply as well on urban WSS programs where WSP has supported&#13;
Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company in its efforts to serve the urban poor. WSP will strengthen its&#13;
support to sanitation and pursue its involvement in WSS services adapted to the needs of HIV/AIDS&#13;
patients.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: Over the years WSP-AF has developed strong relationships with&#13;
the GRZ and with CPs including in particular Irish Aid, UNICEF, and NGOs like Care International and&#13;
WaterAid. WSP-AF will build on these relationships as well as on its long-standing involvement in the&#13;
rural WSS sub-sector to foster and facilitate the policy dialogue at national and district levels. Its capacity&#13;
to do so will be enhanced by the fact WSP-AF resident team in Lusaka was recently increased from one&#13;
to two staff. WSP-AF will continue to add value to Zambia WSS sector from its position as non-donor but&#13;
fully recognized sector partners. WSP-AF will draw on its regional experiences with MDG roadmaps and&#13;
institutional and policy and will help to adapt lessons on innovative approaches for water and sanitation&#13;
delivery. As Zambia has now been a WSP focus country for over 3 years, WSP will apply its knowledge&#13;
function to document and disseminate lessons and best practice gathered over the past 2 years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP-AFâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-AF will continue to support sector coordination through its&#13;
participation in Water SAG and the MDG Technical Committee. As for the rural WSS, WSP-AF will&#13;
support policy dialogue at national level focusing on: (i) implementation issues at the district level under&#13;
the framework of decentralization; and, (ii) the development and roll out of the information management&#13;
system for RWSS. As part of its increased focus on sanitation, WSP-AF will support the elaboration of&#13;
the sanitation component of the NRWSSP. WSP-AF will continue to provide direct support to Lusaka&#13;
Water and Sewerage Company in its drive to extend services to peri-urban settlements. WSP-AF will&#13;
develop its support for practical approaches to meet the WSS needs of HIV/AIDS patients under the&#13;
framework of the country HIV/AIDS coalition. Finally, WSP-AF will start documenting and&#13;
disseminating lessons learnt from Zambia experience with regulation as well as practices and tools to&#13;
extend services to peri-urban settlements.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
REGIONAL STRATEGY&#13;
The Challenge: In East Asia and the Pacific, as more and more countries become middle-income,&#13;
decentralized, and progressively urban, the water supply and sanitation (WSS) challenge is to bring about&#13;
greater commitment to sector reforms, and to create the institutional framework and capacity necessary to&#13;
not only achieve the Millennium Development Goals, but to ensure continuous service delivery&#13;
improvement over and above these targets. The region is broadly on track to meet the overall poverty&#13;
reduction goal, and, due to substantial progress over the last fifteen years, could be one of the few regions&#13;
that meet not only its 2015 water MDG but even the sanitation MDG. However, the collective&#13;
achievements mask wide disparities among countries, and within countries, of their likelihood of reaching&#13;
the goals. Of the five WSP-EAP focus countries, only the Philippines and Vietnam are currently set to&#13;
achieve their 2015 targets based on the latest estimates.&#13;
While government and donor efforts have resulted in gradual improvements in the general state of the&#13;
sector and sector policy throughout the region, it is clear that both governments and donors are keen,&#13;
especially in the context of decentralization and increasing urbanization, to increase the drive towards&#13;
institutional efficiency and effectiveness for policy-making and implementation.&#13;
Although sector reform policies have been put into place in a number of countries in the region, progress&#13;
in implementing these policies has been slow due to a combination of factors (differing from country-to-&#13;
country) which include: weak local capacity, lack of appropriate institutional frameworks, and lack of&#13;
support for sector reform from critical constituencies of stakeholders. As a result, in most countries a wide&#13;
gap exists between national policies and actual implementation. The MDGs provide strengthened impetus&#13;
for accelerating policy reforms as well as large-scale implementation of sector initiatives. WSP-EAP will&#13;
continue to work with clients and partners to formulate pragmatic approaches to achieving the water and&#13;
sanitation goals.&#13;
Sanitation is the least well addressed of the major policy issues in the WSS sector in East Asia.&#13;
According to JMP data, 415 million people lack access to improved water supplies in ASEAN and East&#13;
Asian countries, while almost double the amount, 800 million people, lack access to improved sanitation.&#13;
In addition, meeting the 2015 MDG would still leave 630 million peopleâ&#128;&#148;one third of the projected&#13;
populationâ&#128;&#148;unserved by improved sanitation. The cost of inaction is enormous. The recent WSP-EAP&#13;
Economics of Sanitation Initiative estimates that the financial losses due to poor sanitation and hygiene in&#13;
four East Asian countries (Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam) amount to nearly $2 billion&#13;
per year, with wider economic and welfare impacts valued at $9 billion, equivalent to 2% of combined&#13;
GDP. Poor sanitation services are having serious implications for water quality, which has steadily&#13;
deteriorated in many parts of the region, further contributing to a growing water resources crisis induced&#13;
by the increased consumption of growing economies and populations, deteriorating environments, and&#13;
climate change. Unsanitary conditions in rural and urban environments are a main cause of the regionâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
high burden of water-borne and related diseases. Despite this, the political will to strengthen sanitation&#13;
policies within the broader context of water resources management and increase investment remains low&#13;
across the region.&#13;
Because of top-down service delivery approaches and perverse incentives that perpetuate sub-standard&#13;
performance by service providers, the poor have benefited little from sector interventions. Hence, the&#13;
question as to how to target poor people and ensure that they get access to services is a largely&#13;
unresolved question in the region. Urban growth is accelerating in most countries in East Asia, where&#13;
many of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s mega cities are located. The issue of how to provision medium-sized and small&#13;
townsâ&#128;&#148;where a large part of urban migration and growth is now focusedâ&#128;&#148;has become increasingly&#13;
important and has yet to catch the eye of policymakers. At the same time, improving access to sustainable&#13;
and equitable WSS services in rural areas also remains a key challenge. As the incidence of poverty is&#13;
higher in remote rural areas, helping to reduce the gap between service delivery in accessible and remote&#13;
areas will be important in terms of poverty alleviation.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s Role: WSP-EAP has been focusing in the past few years on assisting governments in the&#13;
formulation and implementation of realistic WSS reform policies that are being supported by a wide&#13;
range of sector stakeholders. In its policy reform activities, WSP-EAP has gained extensive knowledge&#13;
about WSS policies that work in the region, but given the fragmentation of the sector and entrenched&#13;
systems that work against improved sector performance, operationalizing policy and institutional reform&#13;
remains a challenge. WSP-EAP has continued to work with partners and clients in five focal countries to&#13;
understand the implications of the MDGs for sector planning and resource mobilization and to develop&#13;
and implement national strategies to achieve the Goals. Advocacy to increase the political will for&#13;
implementing reforms and increasing investment in the sector with central and local governments as well&#13;
as with civil society is a critical need that WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s expanding work on communications for reform&#13;
addresses.&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s role continues to include the mobilization and optimal use of clientsâ&#128;&#153; and partnersâ&#128;&#153; resources&#13;
to achieve the MDGs through more effective institutions. WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s comparative advantage has been&#13;
biased toward rural, community-managed services, but is now increasingly shifting towards including&#13;
more broad-based expertise to tackle emerging urban challenges, such as small-scale utility improvements&#13;
and access to finance, and services to the urban poor. The Program continues to undertake knowledge&#13;
generation and management through studies, field trials, pilot and demonstration activities, resulting in&#13;
lessons that can feed into policy formulation and implementation. At the same time, the focus has&#13;
increasingly shifted toward institutionalization of best practice in large-scale investments and&#13;
recognition of the role of the sector in poverty reduction and economic growth. Set within a background&#13;
of capacity building (a key comparative advantage) for governments to launch or enhance policy-making&#13;
efforts, this is supported by practical efforts to underpin the development of workable strategies, action&#13;
plans, and overall approaches that make policy happen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAP Comparative Advantage: WSP-EAP has an established network that maintains close&#13;
relationships with many governments and other stakeholders active in the WSS sector. The Program is&#13;
viewed as an honest broker, able to work across and link between all levels, from Ministers to poor&#13;
communities. WSP-EAP assists clients grappling with reform to strengthen learning and partnerships&#13;
across the region. WSP-EAP has a proven track record in the formulation of sector policies in&#13;
collaboration with its partner governments. It also has a strong background in introducing new ideas in&#13;
areas such as utilization of participatory approaches, hygiene promotion, gender, and community-based&#13;
service delivery to the poor, and the introduction/ development of methods to measure the sustainability&#13;
of WSS services. The Programâ&#128;&#153;s institutional location within the World Bank and our strengthening links&#13;
with other major WSS support agencies (Asian Development Bank, UNICEF, WHO) provides it with a&#13;
unique capability to influence and promote large-scale investments in the water and sanitation sector.&#13;
WSP-EAP is also broadening its role in regional advocacy and partnerships, and developing inter-country&#13;
support mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-EAP seeks to use the initiatives and resources of its partners to&#13;
implement sector reforms and accelerate efforts to achieve the MDGs through support for developing&#13;
financing strategies, the design and supervision of large-scale investments, and by generating and sharing&#13;
lessons from field experience in key focus areas. The activities in the region are concentrated primarily,&#13;
but not exclusively, in five countries that have committed to sector reforms: Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao&#13;
PDR, the Philippines, and Vietnam. These countries have been selected because of their high rates of&#13;
poverty, demand for WSS services, the availability of financial partners, and learning opportunities. In&#13;
addition, opportunities are being explored for WSP support to East Timor and the southern provinces of&#13;
China (Yunnan and Guangxi). The thematic approach for the region is directly linked to the major&#13;
challenges that still lie ahead: (i) to focus attention, resources, and effective responses on the burgeoning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
sanitation challengeâ&#128;&#148;both urban and ruralâ&#128;&#148;in the region, including quantifying the costs of poor&#13;
sanitation and reviewing cost-benefit of sanitation options/approaches to support advocacy and decision-&#13;
making; (ii) to assist national and local partners to understand the magnitude of investments required and&#13;
develop strategies to optimize both domestic and external resources to achieve the MDGs; and (iii) to&#13;
ensure that the poor are benefiting equally from WSS interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Summary of Key Projects: Key projects in the region are focusing on sanitation and hygiene, with&#13;
renewed emphasis on water supplyâ&#128;&#148;particularly small and medium-sized utilitiesâ&#128;&#148;steadily increasing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Sanitation and Hygiene Advocacy: This includes the Economics of Sanitation Initiative&#13;
        measuring the financial and economic costs of the lack of adequate sanitation and assessing the&#13;
        costs and benefits of selected sanitation interventions in countries, large-scale and broad-based&#13;
        public-private partnerships on Handwashing with Soap, and the development of culturally&#13;
        appropriate and effective hygiene promotion material.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Decentralized Capacity Building and Policy Implementation: With all five WSP-EAP focus&#13;
        countries decentralizing, this includes support to the local level for (i) the implementation of&#13;
        national water supply and sanitation policies, (ii) sanitation assessments and development of&#13;
        investment strategies as the basis for a new national methodology at scale, and (iii) total&#13;
        sanitation and sanitation marketing strategies targeting sanitation demand, supply, and the&#13;
        enabling environment.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Service Provider Performance Improvement and Access to Finance: WSP-EAP assists small to&#13;
        medium-sized utilities with performance improvement and access to investment finance, and&#13;
        works with domestic private sector providers through action research and technical assistance to&#13;
        support their role in service provision.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Forging Synergies in Inter-Country Support Mechanisms: WSP-EAP has launched a number of&#13;
        highly strategic initiatives and regional knowledge products to increase regional sharing and&#13;
        cross-fertilization of new approaches to the sector challenges. Under the Sustainable Sanitation&#13;
        for Southeast Asia and the Sanitation and Water Partnership for the Mekong Region, this includes&#13;
        post-EASAN follow up activities, the establishment of a regional handwashing network, and&#13;
        parallel/synchronized action research on affordable sanitation options in difficult circumstances&#13;
        across countries in the region.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Communications for Reform: Using strategic communications to help raise consumer demand and&#13;
        the political will for executing sector reforms and increasing effective investment in the water and&#13;
        sanitation sector&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Sector Financing Strategies to Achieve the MDGs: WSP-EAP will synthesize learning from&#13;
        country-focused fiscal analysis and the development of financing strategies, starting with&#13;
        Cambodia and Indonesia, including applied research on understanding and enabling the domestic&#13;
        private sectorâ&#128;&#153;s role in different capacities for water and sanitation service provision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CAMBODIA&#13;
The Challenge: In Cambodia, access to water and sanitation is still quite low, with the latest available&#13;
figures showing coverage of 53% for rural water, 67% for urban water, less than 16% for rural sanitation,&#13;
and 56% for urban sanitation. A recently completed review on access to water supply and sanitation&#13;
shows that the rural poor suffer disproportionally, with less than 5% of the lowest consumption quintile&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    42&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                        FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
having access to improved sanitation. Capacities to address the challenges are unevenly distributed. While&#13;
reform and improvements in the urban water supply sector got off to a promising start, urban sanitation as&#13;
well as rural water supply and sanitation have shown limited progress.&#13;
&#13;
Cambodia must make very large leaps in developing sustainable water and sanitation services if it is to&#13;
achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and the government is aware of this fact. While national&#13;
targets for water supply coverage may be met, it is considered unlikely that the (modest) target for rural&#13;
sanitation coverage will be met by 2012. Efforts to speed up progress through a program of Community-&#13;
Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) are showing promise, although sustainable progress continues to be&#13;
hampered by a physical environment in much of Cambodia that makes it difficult to design low cost&#13;
solutions (flooding, high ground water table, clay). The absence of low-cost durable solutions further&#13;
depresses sanitation investment.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: In response to concerted efforts by the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) and its&#13;
Development Partners, in August 2007 the establishment of a Thematic Working Group (TWG) on Rural&#13;
Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene was authorized by the Prime Minister. This catalytic development&#13;
is a large step forward for the sector, in terms of having RWSS concerns reflected in national&#13;
development planning, although it is too early yet to evaluate longer term impact. Limited institutional&#13;
capacity continues to be a weak point for MRD in carrying out its responsibilities in leading the Rural&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation sector, and concerted efforts will continue to be required to overcome and&#13;
address this constraint.&#13;
MIME has developed a draft regulatory framework and eligibility criteria for private sector involvement&#13;
in WSS for small towns, which is being reviewed and improved with WSP assistance. Capacity building&#13;
activities for domestic private sector suppliers will continue. MIME has requested continuing assistance&#13;
in formulating and implementing its reform strategy, as well as the implementation of diagnostic studies&#13;
on the price of water.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s Role: With the growing focus on decentralized planning and implementation following the&#13;
passage of the law on decentralization and deconcentration, WSP can continue to play a critical role in&#13;
promoting cooperation among key groups â&#128;&#147; Government, donors, NGOs, in the sector. WSP-EAP is also&#13;
well positioned to help the Government develop and implement strategies to achieve the sector MDGs by&#13;
focusing on policy development and reform, enhancing sector performance, increasing sanitation demand;&#13;
and improving household drinking water quality.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: Given its long standing engagement and commitment to the&#13;
sector, WSP-EAP is well placed to help guide sector coordination and reform; continue playing a crucial&#13;
role in Cambodiaâ&#128;&#153;s WSS sector to promote sector-led processes to develop and implement effective&#13;
strategic approaches, encourage sectoral learning, and foster donor coordination.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153; activities in FY09-11 will continue to focus on&#13;
â&#128;¢ Strengthening small scale private provider performance in water supply and sanitation;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Improving sector performance through work with the Government and partners on developing and&#13;
implementing national strategies (rural water supply and sanitation) and strengthening regulation (urban&#13;
water supply);&#13;
â&#128;¢ Developing knowledge and tools to support implementation efforts, for example on low cost&#13;
sanitation options, sanitation marketing technologies, water pricing, and household water quality&#13;
improvements;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Applying the household water quality study results in Vietnam and Lao PDR, following completion&#13;
of the work led by Cambodia (under the SAWAP facility); and Integrating the work on sanitation in&#13;
difficult (flooding) areas with ongoing work in Lao PDR and Vietnam.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
INDONESIA&#13;
The Challenge: Only a fifth of Indonesians have water piped to their homes, and the overwhelming&#13;
majority relies on self-provisioning (household wells), public facilities and unsafe sources. This situation&#13;
has changed little in recent years, despite rapid urbanization and an increasingly stable macroeconomic&#13;
situation. In addition, rapid population growth puts pressures on the environment and negatively affects&#13;
the quality of non-piped water, thus reducing overall access to safe non-piped drinking water.&#13;
&#13;
Access to sanitation facilities continues to be under par with that compared of other countries in the&#13;
region (the Philippines and Vietnam, for example). Almost 70% of urban residents use septic tanks for&#13;
wastewater disposal. These are predominantly unsealed pits which do not provide adequate wastewater&#13;
treatment. Sanitation facilities continue to be dominated by individual, on-site facilities, while less than&#13;
3% of households in only a handful of cities are connected to either communal sanitation systems or&#13;
urban sewage systems. Hygiene behavior remains an issue, with surveys showing that only 12% of&#13;
Indonesians wash their hands with soap after defecation and other critical tasks.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: In recent years, steady economic growth in Indonesia has improved the opportunity&#13;
for a substantial increase in resources for the water and sanitation sector is there. However, a number of&#13;
entrenched challenges need to be tackled urgently to unlock the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s potential, such as revising the&#13;
regulatory and institutional framework; improving corporate governance and access to long-term&#13;
financing; creating a conducive climate for private sector investment; raising awareness and local&#13;
capacity to develop integrated urban sanitation systems; and improving monitoring and oversight by the&#13;
central Government.&#13;
&#13;
More substantial progress has been made in the rural water and sanitation subsector, in particular with&#13;
regard to the policy environment, and in moving from a project/pilot-based towards more programmatic&#13;
approach. The Government has shown to be open to new approaches relying on bottom-up methods such&#13;
as community-led total sanitation, marketing approaches to improve availability of the supply of&#13;
sanitation services, and is interested in substantialâ&#128;&#148;and sustainableâ&#128;&#148; scale up of the various approaches&#13;
tested throughout the country.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s Role: WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s role in Indonesia focuses on influencing sector investments in the&#13;
interests of the poor by focusing on sector policy reform; operationalizing reforms at scale; improving the&#13;
effectiveness of large-scale investments; analytical work on community, financing and institutional&#13;
issues; and building strategic and cooperative alliances with other sector players.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: WSP-EAP has been able to accumulate a critical mass of sector&#13;
knowledge relevant in the country and region as well as link the country effectively with global&#13;
knowledge sources. WSPâ&#128;&#153;s multi-disciplinary skill mix places it in great demand among client and&#13;
partner institutions in Indonesia. Examples include cross-support requested by the World Bank for&#13;
upstream analytical, advisory and preparatory work as well as strategic supervision of both sectoral and&#13;
multi-sector projects, and past and ongoing technical assistance requests from external partner&#13;
organizations.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s activities in FY09-11 continue to be centered&#13;
around&#13;
â&#128;¢ Sector policy/strategy development, enabling environment, and local capacity building for&#13;
operationalization of sector reform;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Advocacy, socio-political pressure and consensus building for change, in particular with regard to&#13;
sanitation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ Scaling up of innovative approaches such as community-based water supply and sanitation and&#13;
sanitation marketing;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Leading and supporting donor harmonization and partnership development;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Strategic support for large-scale investment planning and design by the World Bank and other donors;&#13;
and&#13;
â&#128;¢ Improved sector financing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LAO PDR&#13;
The Challenge: Lao PDR still lags behind regional averages on almost all key social indicators. Figures&#13;
on access to an improved water source, while increasing from 51% in 2004 to 58% in 2006, mask some&#13;
high disparities between urban and rural, poorer areas, with about 50% of Lao PDRâ&#128;&#153;s 10,000 villages still&#13;
without water supply.&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation coverage is the lowest in the region at 30% (67% urban and 20% rural). Given the low&#13;
coverage of sanitary facilities, particularly in the rural areas without road access, the major financing&#13;
challenge is seen as attracting new investors to the sector, which as yet has not been identified as a&#13;
priority by the Government. For sanitation, there is no national policy and there is a lack of high level&#13;
political advocacy. The problems are further constrained by an unclear legal framework for roles,&#13;
responsibilities and actions, where currently many different ministries have overlapping sanitation&#13;
functions.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: The Government has committed to refining, developing, and tailoring its policy and&#13;
strategy environment to ensure that National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy and MDG targets&#13;
are achieved, with national agencies taking the lead in these efforts. It has also realized the sanitation&#13;
sector needs to be developed. Following the EASAN Ministerial Conference in November 2007, the&#13;
Ministry of Health and the Water Resources and Environment Administration held a launching event for a&#13;
National Year of Sanitation in March 2008. The EASAN Declaration has been translated into Lao&#13;
language and is being proposed as a national policy for sanitation, and key sector stakeholders are&#13;
preparing a number of innovative activities to realise government targets for sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s Role: WSP-EAP Lao PDR Country Officeâ&#128;&#153;s support role is currently focusing on the&#13;
challenges cited above through developing a sanitation sector financing strategy; governance mechanisms&#13;
to effectively apply water supply implementing legislation to support policy and strategy actions at field&#13;
level; simplifying business procedures for service provision; improving access to information for&#13;
engagement of people in sector developments; and networking among sector agencies to improve&#13;
coordination.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: WSP-EAP, through its support role to national agencies involved&#13;
in the sector, is able to broker between the Government policymakers, external support agencies and&#13;
NGOs, and the private sector, thereby enhancing the capacities of sector partners to facilitate and guide&#13;
sustainable development of water supply and sanitation. WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s links to the Government also&#13;
provide added value to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s analytical work in the sector, especially in preparation and&#13;
application of the extended CAS and PRSO 4-7 series.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s activities in FY09-11 will focus on&#13;
â&#128;¢       Encouraging a nationally led process of review and improvement of existing legislation, policies&#13;
and strategies;&#13;
â&#128;¢       Implementing strategic communications for reform through capacity building for the government,&#13;
media, and NGOs;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢        Improving sector financing through sanitation supply and demand studies, a review of public&#13;
sector financing of WSS, and a sanitation financing strategy development for coherent investment plans&#13;
for national application;&#13;
â&#128;¢        Advancing hygiene behavior and perception change via hygiene promotion materials for various&#13;
ethnic groups and the creation of demand for appropriate sanitation services; and&#13;
â&#128;¢        Improving sector knowledge by providing powerful advocacy data, such as on the economic&#13;
impact of (the lack of adequate) sanitation&#13;
&#13;
THE PHILIPPINES&#13;
The Challenge: Overall rates of access to water supply increased only slightly to 80.2% in 2004 from&#13;
80% in 2002. At this rate, the country will miss its overall water supply MDG target of 94% by 11%.&#13;
Increase in access has been more pronounced in urban areas, despite rapid urbanization. However, only&#13;
half of the urban population has water piped to their homes, while the rest rely on communal faucet&#13;
systems, improved point sources, and alternative providers, such as water truckers and resellers. Service&#13;
provision is spread over 2,000 utilities, 90% of which have under-5,000 connections.&#13;
&#13;
Overall access to basic sanitation seems poised to meet the MDGs target of 79%. Access data from the&#13;
Department of Health shows a 76% coverage as of 2006 and projects 88% coverage by 2015. But the&#13;
challenge of sanitation in the Philippines relates to high negative externalities in pockets of urban poor&#13;
and rural communities without access to toilets â&#128;&#147; acute gastro enteritis is the second leading cause of&#13;
morbidity and soil-transmitted helminthes is endemic in a number of municipalities; and to the low&#13;
demand for urban wastewater management services from both local leaders and customers and the&#13;
associated low capacity of local governments and service providers to supply cost-effective service&#13;
solutions.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: Starting in 2003, the Government began a sector reform process of consolidating&#13;
utility performance oversight and rationalization of financing in the sector. The implementation process&#13;
has been slow and patchy. Supporting sector reforms to stay on track is essential since it envisions&#13;
oversight and financing agencies to cater to all types of water utilities and provide technical assistance in&#13;
support of less-than-credit-worthy utilities to improve their bankability over time.&#13;
&#13;
Access to water supply and sanitation is recognized as key to promoting health, reducing poverty and&#13;
facilitating economic development. This is reflected in the Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s ten-point agenda and the Medium-&#13;
Term Philippines Development Plan (2005-2010), which sets out targets that will exceed the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
WSS MDGs commitments. Fundamental problems underlying sector under-performance, however, need&#13;
to be addressed if the targets are to be reached and the desired health and poverty impacts are to be&#13;
achieved.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s Role: The WSP Philippines recently completed a cycle of program support focusing on&#13;
assisting the Government in the generation of operational policies and lessons on small utility&#13;
performance enhancement and financing, and in establishing a national program for sustainable&#13;
sanitation. WSP will continue to implement most activities through action research by working with&#13;
service providers and institutions in trialing and testing new systems, while engaging oversight agencies&#13;
on the policy implications of the trial results. WSP Philippines is also increasingly providing resources in&#13;
support of joint activities with World Bank teams.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: WSP-EAP has gained the reputation of being a respected,&#13;
independent source of knowledge in the water and sanitation sector. The Program's comparative&#13;
advantage derives from its brand of collaborative technical assistance, where activities are undertaken by&#13;
a team composed of representatives from government and WSP-EAP, and are peer-reviewed by national&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
and international sector practitioners within the World Bank and non-government or academic&#13;
institutions. Through its analytical and piloting work, WSP-EAP has been able to provide well-informed&#13;
advice to the sector, which facilitated the policy discussions and reforms now underway.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s activities in FY09-11 will focus on&#13;
â&#128;¢ Financing reforms to improve access of less-than-credit-worthy utilities to market-based financing;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Improving economic regulation by making more information available for policy and decision&#13;
makers;&#13;
â&#128;¢ PSP and transaction support to encourage commercial private enterprises to provide water services;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Development of an urban sanitation framework plan through the national sewerage and septage&#13;
management program;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Sanitation sector financing;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Stimulating local government interest on sanitation; and&#13;
â&#128;¢ Environmental health planning.&#13;
&#13;
VIETNAM&#13;
The Challenge: Vietnam consistently displays high annual rates of economic growth and is continuing to&#13;
transition rapidly towards a market economy. Positive sector-related changes in recent years have&#13;
included progressive adoption of demand-responsive approaches and decentralized governance. Rapid&#13;
growth is however having a severe impact on sanitation and the environment, particularly water&#13;
resources, exacerbated by global climate change.&#13;
&#13;
During the last decade, the Government and the donor community have been very active in improving&#13;
access to water supply, but insufficient attention has been given to sanitation. As a result, human excreta&#13;
and solid wastes are becoming major issues at all levels, and are negatively impacting on water resources.&#13;
Achieving the MDG remains a challenging objective for both sub-sectors but in particular for sanitation.&#13;
Overall coverage figures also continue to mask wide disparities in rural/urban access. Small towns are the&#13;
most rapidly growing settlements, but they are the most neglected in terms of policy formulation and&#13;
resource allocation. Thus only a quarter of small towns throughout the country have piped water supply.&#13;
People in other small towns rely on water from increasingly polluted traditional sources.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: The rapid national growth rate and pace of change, as well as the associated high&#13;
volume of infrastructural investment, continue to present opportunities for the WSS sector which donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
exist at similar scale in neighboring countries. In the urban water sector, there is a growing recognition&#13;
that utility reform and access to finance will need to be accelerated if the volume of investment is to have&#13;
long lasting impact. The Government also increasingly recognizes the importance of sanitation and&#13;
hygiene promotion, the need for new efforts in this area, and its potential impact on water resources. As a&#13;
result of rapid urbanization and industrialization, this will be the main area of public and private&#13;
investment in the sector in the next 15-20 years for urban areas. These issues will be equally important for&#13;
rural areas, in coping with growing populations and agricultural and small scale industrial activities.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s Role: WSPâ&#128;&#153;s recent focus has been on supporting large-scale investments, such as the Red&#13;
River Delta RWSS project, and action research linked to such major investments, in order to enhance the&#13;
quality of project outcomes and ensure equitable and sustainable services. While this role in support of&#13;
RWSS will continue, WSPâ&#128;&#153;s effort are also shifting toward meeting the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s requests for a new&#13;
emphasis on sanitation and hygiene; assisting in utility reform and access to finance through capacity&#13;
building in particular of small town water supply services; and subregional work under the Sanitation and&#13;
Water Partnership for the Mekong Region (SAWAP).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: In Vietnam, WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s multi-disciplinary skill mix, deep&#13;
understanding of stakeholder needs, strong links with World Bank operations, use of facilitative and&#13;
process-based approaches, and high local reputation generates continuing demand from client and partner&#13;
institutions. WSPâ&#128;&#153;s sector focus allows it to accumulate a critical mass of sector knowledge relevant to&#13;
Vietnam, as well as link effectively with global knowledge sources. WSP works through action research,&#13;
accompanied by locally appropriate processes for turning new understandings into action, thereby&#13;
influencing scaling up through policy influence and triggering new investments and improvement.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-EAPâ&#128;&#153;s activities in FY09-11 will continue to focus on&#13;
â&#128;¢ Support to the development of a unified sanitation strategy covering urban, peri-urban small town,&#13;
and rural areas, including behavioral change;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Support to rural water supply and sanitation strategy updating;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Promoting the integration of sanitation into water resources management;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Building a national hand washing initiative to help deliver the full impact of investments in sanitation;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Support to urban WSS service delivery through benchmarking of utilities and capacity building; and&#13;

&#13;
REGIONAL STRATEGY&#13;
The Challenge: The Water and Sanitation Program-Latin America and Caribbean Region (WSP-&#13;
LAC) includes two sub-regions where WSP is active: i) the Andean Region where WSP is active in&#13;
Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador; and ii) Central America where WSP is active in Honduras, Nicaragua and&#13;
El Salvador. WSP-LACâ&#128;&#153;s presence in Peru and Honduras is rather strong, and has been strengthened&#13;
considerably in other countries with the opening of new offices in Bolivia, in Nicaragua and Ecuador,&#13;
within the corresponding World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Resident Missions.&#13;
&#13;
Latin American countries are known for their dual economies whereby economic growth has not&#13;
benefited all, and social inequalities are very vivid. This situation has led to major social unrest in&#13;
Bolivia, and to a lesser degree, though still quite strong in Peru, Ecuador, and Central America.&#13;
Adequate water supply and sanitation has been one of the main claims of the poor, and in general,&#13;
management of water and supply and sanitation services is not satisfactory. This situation is reflected&#13;
through the following data (JMP, 2004 / CEPIS 2005):&#13;
&#13;
Â&#131;   Water supply&#13;
       In the region, about 60 million persons are without access to safe drinking water, out of&#13;
       which 40 million are from the rural areas, and 20 millions from the urban areas. The number&#13;
       of people lacking access in the urban areas is increasing everyday due to heavy demographic&#13;
       and immigration pressure. Out of the total of the existing water supply devices, it is estimated&#13;
       that 40% supply water is not disinfected and that 60% of the systems are not functioning in a&#13;
       permanent way, which raises the question of sustainability. Finally, an average of 45% of the&#13;
       produced water is not accounted.&#13;
&#13;
Â&#131;   Sanitation&#13;
       In the region, there are about 137 million persons who have no access to sanitation facilities,&#13;
       72 million of those are in rural areas and 65 million are in urban areas. The coverage of the&#13;
       persons having access in urban areas to some sewerage systems (conventional or&#13;
       condominial) is 49%, but only 14% of these systems are treating the effluents. Waste water&#13;
       management is in dire straits in the Region.&#13;
&#13;
Today, 3 countries have reached the MDGs (Mexico, Venezuela and Chile), while 7 another countries&#13;
are likely to meet the MDGs (Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Paraguay, Republica&#13;
Dominicana and Uruguay). However, the others are still not going to meet the MDGs; since their&#13;
rural sanitation coverage is low: Peru (32%), Bolivia (22%), and Nicaragua (34%).&#13;
&#13;
In order to face these challenges, WSP â&#128;&#147; LAC, after consultations with the Sector authorities with&#13;
whom it is working, has highlighted a series of priority areas in which to intervene and where it can&#13;
have the most impact. These key areas of intervention are:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Sector Policy Support: Focusing on national sector debate, and planning and WSS financing&#13;
        with emphasis on the poor and MDG achievement. Additionally, WSP-LAC efforts will be&#13;
        oriented to promote sustainability, and alternative development / financial processes,&#13;
        including the review and the documentation of the experience with SWAPs.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Institutional Development: Supporting decentralization processes, in order to strengthen&#13;
        local capacities and finance. WSP-LAC will promote the introduction of new management&#13;
        models with a clear component of social participation, and participation of small scale&#13;
        providers and /or private operators.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Sanitation and hygiene: WSP-LAC will promote behavioral change approaches through the&#13;
        handwashing initiative, as well as good practices on safe domestic water storage, and impulse&#13;
&#13;
                                                  51&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                         FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        sanitation at household level. WSP-LAC has started introducing the concept of sanitation&#13;
        marketing and businesses, together with appropriate sanitation processes.&#13;
    â&#128;¢   Knowledge Management: Disseminating best practices at regional and global levels, in&#13;
        order other Regions can benefit from the LAC experiences, as well as providing technical&#13;
        assistance for developing sector information systems (including monitoring). WSP-LAC will&#13;
        continue consolidating sector dialogue among all stakeholders, through sector committees,&#13;
        Water groups, or Sector networks.&#13;
Today, all governments include in their water sector policy the dimension of water resources&#13;
management. In addition, there are some very positive water resource management experiences at the&#13;
community level in the Andean Region that need to be documented. It is proposed to document the&#13;
existing experiences at the community level, where WatSan Committees integrate this dimension with&#13;
success.&#13;
&#13;
In accordance with WSP's global strategy, WSP-LAC will be instrumental in enhancing knowledge&#13;
management in the region through its own channels or through exploring possibilities for partnerships&#13;
where impact can be maximized.&#13;
&#13;
The International Year of Sanitation has helped to mobilize agencies and to focus everyoneâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
attention, for the first time ever in Latin America, on an issue that no one was speaking about at high&#13;
level. The Latinosan Conference organized in Cali in November 2007 that mobilized more than 800&#13;
participants, 20 development agencies and Government Representatives of 17 countries who signed a&#13;
Ministerial Conference, has set the pace for 2008. Six months after, Peru, Bolivia, Central America&#13;
and the Caribbean have already been organizing their own promotional events, and numerous&#13;
advocacy messages and knowledge products on sanitation are being prepared. WSP will continue to&#13;
facilitate and mobilize this effort as well as monitor the implementation of the Ministerial&#13;
Declaration.&#13;
&#13;
The above-mentioned challenges are important especially given the fact that donor funding is often&#13;
more oriented towards Africa and Asia, but WSP-LAC believes that there are possibilities to move&#13;
ahead with innovative financial partnerships. Finally, proposed activities will be guided by demand,&#13;
donor interest, WSPâ&#128;&#153;s own strategy, capacity and know how, as well as impact.&#13;
&#13;
Today, WSP LAC benefits from an increased source of funding mainly coming from the Swiss Agency&#13;
for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the Dutch Cooperation that are coupled in order to duplicate&#13;
impact and mainly focusing on MDGs policy support, decentralization, sanitation development and&#13;
dissemination of best practices. WSP also benefits from the support of the Department for International&#13;
Development (DfID) as part of a global study focusing on the promotion of the domestic private sector,&#13;
and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) is supporting a post-earthquake&#13;
reconstruction project in Peru. Finally, WSP-LAC also highly benefits from the Melinda and Bill Gates&#13;
Foundation, which is supporting the implementation of the Handwashing Initiative in all 24 Regions of&#13;
Peru with a strong focus on impact evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to a continuous dialogue with sector authorities, WSP LAC is gradually developing a network&#13;
of alliances with key partners such PAHO (Pan-American Health Organization), SNV (Dutch Volunteers&#13;
Organization), CAN (Andean Community of Nations), FOCARD (Central American Forum), RRASCA&#13;
(Regional Network for Water and Sanitation in Central America) together with RASNIC (from&#13;
Nicaragua), RASHON (from Honduras), RASEL (from El Salvador), RASGUA (from Guatemala).&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Role: WSP-LAC will continue to support reform and policy development by providing&#13;
sector institutions with technical assistance in order to ensure the provision of WSS services to the&#13;
poor in peri-urban areas, small towns and rural areas, with an emphasis on sanitation. WSP-LAC will&#13;
&#13;
                                                  52&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                         FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
also provide policy makers with its experiences and lessons learned in the field (in Peru and other&#13;
Latin American countries) that can then be adapted to other countriesâ&#128;&#153; realities. It will also act as a&#13;
promoter, through documenting and analyzing existing experiences for reaching the urban poor.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, WSP-LAC will play a facilitating role in constituting â&#128;&#156;Grupos de ConcertaciÃ³nâ&#128;?&#13;
(Consultation Groups) in projects where it is involved, as this process has proven to be an effective&#13;
mechanism for enhancing country ownership, project monitoring, and follow-up.&#13;
&#13;
FOCARD-APS and RRASCA in Central America have requested TA from WSP to develop MDGs&#13;
road maps and efficient monitoring systems to follow up the pace of actions oriented to reach the&#13;
goals. In Nicaragua, the ongoing implementation of a SWAP, as well the interest expressed in&#13;
Honduras, provide WSP with a good opportunity to strengthen a new line of work that together with&#13;
the involvement in the PRSP might help in hitting poverty.&#13;
&#13;
In the context of the International Year of Sanitation, Sanitation will continue to be an area of main&#13;
concern. WSP LAC has taken a sharp shift to address this challenge, by introducing the concept of&#13;
sanitation as a business (already in preparation for implementation). Other countries have already&#13;
requested that we do the same for them. Hand washing has been an enormous success story in Peru,&#13;
not only in terms of messages, but especially in terms of public-private partnerships; WSP has started&#13;
a new phase, in which an emphasis is made on impact monitoring and evaluation. The Ministry of&#13;
Health of Peru is interested in duplicating this initiative to other areas of public health. WSP-LAC&#13;
will also continue its efforts in promoting the handwashing initiative in Bolivia and in Central&#13;
America.&#13;
&#13;
The lessons learnt from decentralization and management models in small towns in Peru have proven&#13;
to be, on the long run, very positive, and are ready for duplication in other countries. WSP â&#128;&#147; LAC has&#13;
stated a participatory process in the management of WSS in the Amazon Basin that is gaining a strong&#13;
momentum and that is a pioneering project in the Region. Finally, the study of the seven cities&#13;
(Tegucigalpa, Managua, Medellin, Guayaquil, Lima, Arequipa and Santa Cruz) on the status of WSS&#13;
service to the poor is generating high level of interest and could lead to further projects in the near&#13;
future.&#13;
&#13;
In Peru, as a response to the earthquake of the 15th of August 2007 (Richter 7.9), WSP has provided&#13;
support in making rapid diagnosis of the damage occurred to water supply and sanitation systems.&#13;
WSP will start a major project supporting the planning of the reconstruction and capacity- building&#13;
efforts as well. In addition, WSP-LAC is supporting the decentralization process in five regions in&#13;
order to strengthen the capacity of municipalities and regional Governments to plan for their water&#13;
and sanitation services. This project is followed closely by the Ministry of Housing and Sanitation,&#13;
and should serve as a model for the regions.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Comparative Advantage: WSP-LAC has the advantage of practicing regional outreach&#13;
either through its own channels or through the World Bank. It is recognized regionally as a facilitator&#13;
that is able to put institutions and people together. Furthermore, it has progressively gained a strong&#13;
knowledge of country realities in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Strategic Activity Selection: This coming year, WSP-LAC will develop activities in the&#13;
following areas:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Consolidate its regional communication strategy and continue decentralizing sector knowledge&#13;
    through the Spanish speaking e-newsletter AguaLatina; WSP will reorient efforts towards&#13;
    promoting Communication for Development as an integral component of sector programs and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  53&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                        FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    projects, and strengthen sector networks and committees in each focus country to facilitate&#13;
    sustainable and country-owned development&#13;
â&#128;¢   Give more emphasis to sanitation development, by following up on the Latinosan Conference as&#13;
    well as on the initiatives that are starting in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Central America and the&#13;
    Caribbean; it will continue to develop a sanitation marketing approach, promote alternative&#13;
    sanitation options, and provide technical assistance for the development of Sanitation MDG&#13;
    Roadmaps;&#13;
â&#128;¢   Document and disseminate lessons learnt over the past four years on management models, small&#13;
    towns, sanitation innovation, handwashing, water supply and sanitation services;&#13;
â&#128;¢   Continue to support sector development for the poor in Ecuador and Bolivia, as mentioned in the&#13;
    project sheets;&#13;
â&#128;¢   Share best practices on developing sustainable and quality sector information systems in Central&#13;
    America;&#13;
â&#128;¢   Support decentralization by providing technical assistance on strengthening local capacities for&#13;
    sustainable WSS delivery.&#13;
&#13;
Summary of Key Projects: Key projects in the region are focusing on sanitation and hygiene,&#13;
supporting sector authorities in decentralization and governance, assistance for designing strategies&#13;
and policies, and promoting knowledge management and communication efforts:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   Sanitation and Hygiene: This includes LatinoSan follow-up at sub-regional and country levels in&#13;
    order to operationalize Cali agreements, introduce the concept of sanitation marketing and&#13;
    businesses together with appropriate sanitation processes expanding experience from Peru to&#13;
    Central America, and implement the Handwashing Initiative evenly across regions in Peru in&#13;
    order to effectively measure impact, as well as accompany expansion of HW initiatives in El&#13;
    Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Panama, and Bolivia.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   Decentralization and governance: WSP-LAC will support decentralization and local capacity&#13;
    strengthening for WS services provision to the poor in rural areas and small towns in Honduras&#13;
    and Nicaragua, and will implement a major project in Peru to facilitate the rehabilitation and&#13;
    reconstruction of water and sanitation services in 8 provinces hit by the earthquake.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   Sector Strategies and Policies: This support will be provided in the Andean Region and Central&#13;
    America by assisting Central American governments in following up Sanitation Road Maps and&#13;
    FOCARDâ&#128;&#153;s strategy, developing a specific and participatory strategy for peri-urban areas in&#13;
    Bolivia, validating a methodology for sector planning at regional level to be implemented nation-&#13;
    wide in Peru, and supporting the design of policies in Ecuador to implement new alternative&#13;
    technologies to increase service coverage.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   Knowledge Management and Communication: WSP-LAC will disseminate lessons learned from&#13;
    the Small Town Pilot Project for replication at regional and global levels; in Central America, it&#13;
    will provide technical assistance to create a sub-regional knowledge management center based on&#13;
    existing national and regional networks; and at regional level promote cross-cutting&#13;
    communication components in sector programs and projects.&#13;
&#13;
BOLIVIA&#13;
The Challenge: Bolivia has approximately 9.6 million inhabitants, 67% are in urban areas and 33%&#13;
in rural areas. The coverage of water and sanitation is among the lowest in the continent, almost 2.5&#13;
million do not have access to safe water and 5.0 million have no improved sanitation facilities. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 54&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                           FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lack of appropriate services mainly affects people in peri-urban and rural dispersed areas who are the&#13;
most vulnerable.&#13;
&#13;
The main problems facing the sector in Bolivia are i) the coverage gap in WSS in peri-urban and rural&#13;
dispersed areas, ii) the gap in sanitation and treatment (less than 29% of wastewater is adequately&#13;
treated), iii) the lack of specific strategies to improve coverage, management and quality of services,&#13;
iv) the sector institutional weakness at national, sub national and local levels and v) the lack of funds&#13;
and trained human resources to meet the WSS MDGs. In terms of the legal framework of the WSS&#13;
sector, this is incomplete and law 2066 must be adapted to the new sector policies established in the&#13;
National Development Plan (NDP).&#13;
&#13;
Major sector challenges in Bolivia include the following:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   The definition of specific strategies for peri-urban and dispersed rural areas that enhance&#13;
    sustainable WSS coverage.&#13;
â&#128;¢   The identification of appropriate promotion and dissemination process and the realization of&#13;
    specific studies on socio-cultural aspects and treatment to enhance the sanitation in Bolivia.&#13;
â&#128;¢   The definition of operational mechanisms for technical assistance to strengthen EPSA's.&#13;
â&#128;¢   The impact assessment of climate change and global warming on water resources and the&#13;
    definition of a strategy to face emergencies.&#13;
â&#128;¢   The institutional capacity building at national, sub national and local to improve performance in&#13;
    planning, investment plan design, water and sanitation projects, water quality control programs,&#13;
    regulation and communication.&#13;
&#13;
Despite the major challenges described above, opportunities do exist. The National Development Plan&#13;
is aligned with the WSS MDGs and the poverty reduction policies. The multilateral and bilateral&#13;
cooperation agencies, as SIDA, WB and others, have fully engaged in contributing to assist&#13;
government to develop the sector policies and respond to demand of poor people, especially in&#13;
sanitation and WSS in peri-urban and dispersed rural areas. The GoB and the WB have initiated a&#13;
sanitation program for the poor in the city of Santa Cruz and small towns around Titikaka Lake.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Role:&#13;
â&#128;¢ To provide factual evidence to assess the current situation of relevant sector issues, including the&#13;
  sustainability of WSS, hygiene practices among the urban poor, and WSS management in small&#13;
  towns.&#13;
â&#128;¢ To provide examples of best practices relevant to sector issues under discussion, i.e., condominial&#13;
  technology.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Through sector networking groups, to facilitate the presentation, analysis, and dialogue on these&#13;
  issues.&#13;
â&#128;¢ To provide technical support to the government and institutions willing to apply the lessons&#13;
  learned and best practices on these issues to their own policies and investments.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Comparative Advantage: WSP is well-known for its extensive experience in knowledge&#13;
management, provision of technical assistance in the implementation of sector policies, and&#13;
innovative technologies and strategies for the provision of water and sanitation services in the Andean&#13;
region. In addition, WSP has a wide experience in networking with sector government agencies,&#13;
NGOs, and cooperation agencies.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Strategic Activity Selection: In the FY09-11, WSP will implement, in close collaboration&#13;
and coordination with GoB, the sector networks and in close coordination with the WB, the following&#13;
activities in Bolivia:&#13;
&#13;
                                                   55&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                          FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   Support the design of coherent WSS peri-urban strategy promoting the increase coverage and&#13;
    quality of WSS to the poor and promoting creation/scaling up of financial models.&#13;
â&#128;¢   Implement and disseminate experience systematization on heath, sanitation and non-&#13;
    conventional technologies among others.&#13;
â&#128;¢   Strengthen the sector coordination network, cross sector and local alignment and harmonization&#13;
    with the GoB, international agencies (WB and others) to promote the sector development and&#13;
    specifics projects for peri-urban and rural areas.&#13;
â&#128;¢   National workshop to promote sanitation at different levels&#13;
â&#128;¢   Promote institutional capacity building to improve the performance of the sector planers and&#13;
    technicians at national, subnational and local levels.&#13;
&#13;
ECUADOR&#13;
The Challenge: In Ecuador the WSS sector has a long history of poor performance, well below the&#13;
standards of other Latin American countries. The main problems include weak institutions and&#13;
institutional overlap at all levels, lack of sector policies and laws, and no PSP in the provision of&#13;
services. This results in low WSS coverage rates, and investments that are neither sustainable nor&#13;
able to keep up with growing demand.&#13;
&#13;
Among the major challenges are:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Enhancing coverage and quality of services. WSS service levels are among the lowest in South&#13;
  America. Although total coverage rates show 67% for water supply and 57% for sanitation (with&#13;
  no wastewater treatment), these numbers hide the deficit in rural areas, where 40% of the&#13;
  population lives. In both rural and urban areas, water supply is intermittent and few systems&#13;
  provide continuing treatment. Nationwide, sector investments have failed to keep up with&#13;
  population growth and coverage actually decreased three percentage points between 1990 and&#13;
  1995.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Enhancing the sustainability of RWSS. In rural areas, communities have demonstrated relatively&#13;
  good capacity to keep the water flowing, more or less, on shoe-string budgets. Nonetheless, these&#13;
  systems also show a dramatic decrease in water quality, and design flows over time. They also&#13;
  suffer from poor financial management and are not sustainable in the long term.&#13;
&#13;
In 2002, Ecuador formulated the Water and Sanitation National Policy, the Sector Development Plan&#13;
for short, mid and long term, and the Sector Reform, aiming at complying with the MDGs, but not yet&#13;
implemented. In January 2007, the new elected authority started to increase significantly the basic&#13;
services coverage by incorporating national goals higher than the MDGs, managing internal and&#13;
external financial resources, and designing the 2007-2010 Environmental National Plan.&#13;
The investment on water and sanitation has increased considerably on 2006-2007 (more than 150&#13;
millions of US dollars), because of the national decision to assign the increased oil funds to water and&#13;
sanitation. Another increase comes from the special consumer tax from which a significant part has&#13;
been also assigned to water and sanitation. However, in January 2008, the special consumption tax&#13;
was eliminated.&#13;
&#13;
To reach its high goals, the government has decided to implement technological and methodological&#13;
innovations, to extend coverage, especially in peri-urban and rural areas. However, WSP will reduce&#13;
its presence in Ecuador and focus only on 2 main areas that have been discussed with WB LAC&#13;
operations:&#13;
&#13;
    1. Publication of the sector magazine â&#128;&#156;Agua Yakuâ&#128;?.&#13;
    2. Dissemination of the Condominial Technology.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  56&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                       FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Role:&#13;
â&#128;¢ To provide factual evidence to assess the current situation in rural areas of Ecuador on the&#13;
  sustainability of Rural WSS and improve the capacity of the management of the systems.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Through sector networking groups, to facilitate the presentation, analysis, and dialogue on key&#13;
  sector issues, and continue publishing the sector Magazine â&#128;&#156;Agua Yakuâ&#128;?.&#13;
â&#128;¢ To provide technical support to the government and institutions willing to apply the lessons&#13;
  learned and best practices on these issues to their own policies and investments.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Comparative Advantage: WSP is well-known for its extensive experience in knowledge&#13;
management, provision of technical assistance in the implementation of sector policies, and&#13;
innovative technologies for the provision of water and sanitation services in the Andean region. In&#13;
addition, WSP has a wide experience in networking with sector government agencies, NGOs, and&#13;
cooperation agencies.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Strategic Activity Selection: In the next fiscal year, WSP will implement, in close&#13;
collaboration and coordination with sector networks and the Bank, the following activities in&#13;
Ecuador:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Support the Sector Committee on the preparation, publication of the sector magazine â&#128;&#156;Agua&#13;
    Yakuâ&#128;?.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Support the dissemination of the Condominial technology&#13;
&#13;
CENTRAL AMERICA&#13;
&#13;
The challenge: Meeting the WSS MDGs in Honduras and Nicaragua demands financial, institutional,&#13;
and technological resources not readily available in these two HIPC countries. Low economic&#13;
growth, increasing unemployment, and high levels of poverty hinder sustained access of WSS to the&#13;
rural and urban poor. Although there is relatively high urban infrastructure coverage, (92% in&#13;
Honduras and 91.4% in Nicaragua), the reliability and quality of urban services is low (service 6&#13;
hours/day; 51% treated). Even though the access to sanitation is 94% (Honduras) and 95%&#13;
(Nicaragua), only 53% in the first and 34% in the second country are connected to sewerage systems.&#13;
The remaining population is served by septic tanks and individual solutions, where the poor are even&#13;
worse served: Low rural water infrastructure coverage in Nicaragua (51.0%); relatively high in&#13;
Honduras (70%) with extremely unreliable service quality (14% treated; service every other day);&#13;
extremely low sanitation infrastructure coverage in both countries (24% Nicaragua; 49.5%&#13;
Honduras). In terms of sector reforms, both countries have initiated substantial sector policy and&#13;
regulation reforms in order to meet the MDGs. Despite these efforts, weak institutions currently lead&#13;
processes with unclear procedures on how to proceed systematically.&#13;
&#13;
Major challenges for the water and sanitation sector in these two countries are the following:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Local governments are now challenged with increased responsibilities for the provision of WSS;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Limited opportunity for private-sector participation in the provision of WSS, and limited in-&#13;
   country experience in public-private partnerships for providing WSS;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Dispersed, and often obsolete, norms and regulations for provision of WSS, limiting the ability to&#13;
   scale up the provision of sustainable WSS;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Sector agencies with limited funds for WSS monitoring and evaluation;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Weak coordination between government, civil society, and cooperation agencies in defining long-&#13;
   term strategies for the WS sector; and,&#13;
â&#128;¢ Civil society has low understanding and support to water sector modernization because of a lack&#13;
   of solid communication and information systems.&#13;
Despite the major challenges described, opportunities do exist. Both countries have prepared&#13;
comprehensive PRSP aligned with the WSS MDGs. Multilateral and bilateral financial and&#13;
&#13;
                                                 57&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                       FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
cooperation agencies have fully engaged in contributing to assist governments in the implementation&#13;
of their PRSPs. As a result, both countries are in the early stages of preparing SWAPs for water and&#13;
sanitation. The new administration in Honduras with support of the WB and WSP participation is&#13;
actively discussing a Development Plan for the WSS strengthening decentralization and promoting&#13;
the adoption of innovative management models delegating to FHIS the lead of actions. The process&#13;
includes the transference of Tegucigalpaâ&#128;&#153;s WSS to the Municipality, where the provision of services&#13;
to the urban poor would require special attention. The donorâ&#128;&#153;s table has expressed support to the&#13;
reform and willingness to assist in the implementation process.. In parallel, increased participation&#13;
from civil society is steadily shifting to address the sector's issues and long-term goals. The water&#13;
sector authorities in Nicaragua have also agreed a work plan with WSP where the support to the&#13;
ongoing SWAP development is a priority together the development of the Water Sector Strategy&#13;
prepared with donors support. At Central America Regional level, the FOCARD-APS and RRAS-CA&#13;
request for support to develop MDGs roadmaps and to share experiences to build sustainable sector&#13;
information systems is a challenge as well as an opportunity for WSP. The WSP planning process in&#13;
Honduras and Nicaragua were discussed and agreed with government authorities and key cooperation&#13;
agencies such as SDC, ACDI and ASDI.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LACâ&#128;&#153;s Role: The Programâ&#128;&#153;s role in Honduras and Nicaragua involves:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Contributing to sector and policy modernization, promoting the increase in coverage and quality&#13;
  of WSS services to the most poor, and promoting creation/scaling up of financial models and&#13;
  project strategies to increase long- term sustainability of WSS in rural areas and small towns;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Contributing to the management and sharing of knowledge at country and regional levels,&#13;
  strengthening national and regional networks, as well as regional organizations such as FOCARD&#13;
  and RRASCA. Contributing to scaling up sustainable WSS services, focusing on knowledge&#13;
  transfer to local governments capabilities, and capacity building of key stakeholders at country&#13;
  and regional levels; and&#13;
â&#128;¢ Contributing to the strengthening of WSP-LAC's local partners and clients for increased sector&#13;
  participation in meeting the MDG goals, implementing WSP-LACâ&#128;&#153;s client-driven strategies in&#13;
  close coordination with local partners and financiers, and increasing the participation of local&#13;
  water and sanitation networks, as a discussion forum for sector challenges and goals.&#13;
&#13;
WSP- LACâ&#128;&#153;s Comparative Advantage: Since the opening of its hub office in Honduras in February&#13;
2003, WSP-LAC has increased its regional recognition by governments and donors, as an institution&#13;
experienced in knowledge management and technical assistance for the implementation of sector&#13;
policies and innovative technologies for the provision of WSS. The Program's position within the&#13;
sector in Honduras and Nicaragua, and recently El Salvador is strengthened by its access to global&#13;
knowledge networks, inside and outside WSP. Contribution to the water sector policy dialog and&#13;
PRSP has been also recognized by the WB CMU in both countries.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LACâ&#128;&#153;s Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-LAC will continue to focus on Honduras and&#13;
Nicaragua, where activities will be oriented to support the decentralization, the access of the urban&#13;
poor to quality water and sanitation services, and improving the access to sanitation services. In&#13;
addition, effort will be given to support the regional activities in CA by working with RRAS-CA and&#13;
FOCARD-APS. The intervention strategy will also look to learn from South America and global&#13;
experiences strategies to reach MDGs. Specifically the Program will:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Support decentralization in Honduras and Nicaragua,,&#13;
â&#128;¢ Assist both countries in developing a strategy to reach the urban poor with quality water and&#13;
    sanitation services,&#13;
â&#128;¢ Learn from South America and other global experiences on strategies to reach MDGs.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Strengthen collaboration with RRAS-CA and FOCARD-APS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                           FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PERU&#13;
Challenge: In Peru, The water and sanitation sector is characterized by a low coverage and poor&#13;
quality of service, as well as a precarious financial situation of the service providers. In addition to&#13;
this situation, the lack of incentives to improve the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s management has reduced the investment&#13;
to a minimal level that is starting to affect the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s sustainability. The tariff policy is divorced&#13;
from the reality that operates in the sector with respect to the investments and financing, which&#13;
aggravates the problem even more. Moreover, the institutional and regulatory frameworks need&#13;
adjustments to improve the governance within the service providers, and on the other side, to allow&#13;
SUNASS to perform efficiently its regulatory role.&#13;
&#13;
To reverse this situation, the sector requires structural reforms, to minimize political interference on&#13;
the management of the services, and to introduce adequate incentives to progressively accomplish the&#13;
sustainable development of the services. From this perspective, it is felt that the main policies,&#13;
strategies and activities of the WSP program in Peru are: (i) the development of a system to guarantee&#13;
sustainable investments, mainly including the development of a financial and tariff policy which&#13;
introduces the necessary incentives for the sustainability and to promote at the same time, the service&#13;
provision efficiency and incorporate the service to the poorest population; and (ii) the strengthening&#13;
of the institutional and regulatory framework to introduce the service providerâ&#128;&#153;s government&#13;
corporative best practices, and allow the tariff and financial policies to be coherent, making sure that&#13;
SUNASS efficiently assumes its role.&#13;
&#13;
In spite of these challenges, the country presents some opportunities for positive change. First, the&#13;
long-awaited process of decentralization has begun, and local governments have new facilities at&#13;
regional and local levels. There is also a political commitment to create solutions to the WSS crisis.&#13;
The government had finished the National Plan and planned to validate it with Decentralized&#13;
Government at Regional Level and additionally has been participating in the PRONASAR project,&#13;
which is designed to provide sustainable WSS to rural areas. In Limaâ&#128;&#153;s metropolitan area, the water&#13;
firm SEDAPAL has implemented a project oriented at including peri-urban areas in its coverage,&#13;
using an innovative participatory strategy. Finally, at the institutional level, the Committee on Sector&#13;
Coordination, and the Donor Committee â&#128;&#156;Grupo Aguaâ&#128;? in collaboration with sector authorities, has&#13;
strengthened its scope of action and will soon expand to the national level.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Role: WSP-LAC will continue to support sector reform by providing technical assistance&#13;
to regulatory institutions in order to create awareness of the need to include peri-urban, small towns&#13;
and rural areas in new sector policies. It will also provide policy makers with its experiences and&#13;
lessons learned in the field, in Peru as in other Latin American countries, for them to be adapted to the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s reality.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC comparative advantage: WSP has a strong office and presence in Peru, and is able to&#13;
respond to various demands. It has contributed to establish the Grupo de Agua, in which the major&#13;
development agencies of the water sector collaborate. It has also contributed to set up a Sector&#13;
Committee composed of 34 NGOs and agencies that periodically produce a sector magazine called&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Aguaâ&#128;?.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-LAC Strategic Activity Selection:&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Facilitate harmonization between agencies and NGOs in the spirit of the Paris&#13;
             Declaration, through the Grupo de Agua and the Sector Committee.&#13;
         â&#128;¢ Support the decentralization process through 5 regions but also disseminate the&#13;
             experience of PROPILAS and SAMBASUR to other regions.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
REGIONAL STRATEGY&#13;
The Challenge: Across South Asia, Water and Sanitation Services (WSS) remain intermittent,&#13;
inefficient, unsustainable and costly. Rapid economic growth and escalating infrastructure investment&#13;
in South Asia have led neither to consistent improvement in the quality of services, nor to poverty&#13;
reduction at the scale required under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). A lack of reliable&#13;
and coherent data on water and sanitation service levels, customers and sector finances makes it&#13;
difficult to depict the status of the sector accurately or plan, manage and monitor service delivery and&#13;
the achievement of any targets effectively. The challenge is not merely one of WSS project&#13;
management, but concerns the wider issue of institutional accountability.&#13;
&#13;
Large numbers of people remain unconnected or have to cope with intermittent service provision,&#13;
decaying infrastructure and unsafe conditions. In urban areas, no city or town in South Asia has water&#13;
supply for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; large numbers of people lack access to safe sanitation and&#13;
most estimates indicate that the number of people without safe sanitation in urban areas actually&#13;
increased since the 1990s. Solid waste is a very visible problem, but many initiatives remain&#13;
technology-driven, ignoring the lack of institutional accountability. Coverage of rural water supply&#13;
infrastructure has improved to some extent, but water supply is generally not safe, reliable or&#13;
affordable. Bacteriological risk is heightened by not linking sanitation to water supply. Dropping&#13;
groundwater tables and deteriorating groundwater quality threaten source sustainability. Most&#13;
governments have invested in infrastructure and technology, but conventional service delivery&#13;
mechanisms have been supply driven, bureaucratic and fragmented.&#13;
&#13;
These patchy services impose high coping costs on all citizens, not only financially, but also in the&#13;
form of health and environmental hazards and loss of productivity. The poor, vulnerable, women and&#13;
children carry the highest burden, as they lack the resources to invest in safe coping mechanisms.&#13;
Operational and financial practices in the WSS sector also deny the poorâ&#128;&#153;s right to be treated as fully-&#13;
fledged customers. The evidence that people are willing to pay for services continues to be ignored,&#13;
while general subsidies do not reach the unconnected poor. As people do not pay for services,&#13;
providers do not treat them as customers and remain unresponsive to their needs.&#13;
&#13;
The experience in India shows that more finance and investment in new infrastructure alone cannot&#13;
meet this challenge. Sustainable WSS services and achieving the MDG targets will become feasible&#13;
only if the quality of local governance improves, sector agencies become more responsive to&#13;
customers, and involve non-state interest groups and providers on a larger scale. The challenge is to&#13;
institutionalize demand-driven delivery of services and instill behavior change. This requires enabling&#13;
environments, clear sector strategies, systematic service improvements in all aspects of the delivery&#13;
chain, and responsiveness to customer demand. In WSP-SAâ&#128;&#153;s focus countries in South Asia this&#13;
reform agenda plays out in different settings, but all involve decentralization in some form â&#128;&#147;&#13;
Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;big-bangâ&#128;? decentralization; Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s formal stance to empower rural and urban local&#13;
governments under the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments; and Bangladesh now enhancing&#13;
fiscal transfers to local government to cope with the failure of national delivery systems and the&#13;
arsenic crisis. For South Asia the challenge is to scale up these institutional changes, within water and&#13;
sanitation structures, but also within the wider intergovernmental, urban and rural frameworks and the&#13;
interfaces between governance structures, communities and service providers.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA Role: WSP-SAâ&#128;&#153;s role is to provide active advisory services to support and enhance the&#13;
capacity of the client to undertake and sustain institutional change. WSP-SA provides a unique&#13;
model for delivering technical assistance to the clients, based on â&#128;&#152;learning-by-doingâ&#128;&#153;. Four strategic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   63&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                           FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
themes cut across our project activities, the sum total of which seeks to add up to enabling&#13;
environments for reform, governance and service delivery; sector-specific transformation strategies;&#13;
improved service delivery by accountable providers; and social accountability, i.e. transparent&#13;
avenues for customers to hold their providers accountable. The demand for more regional initiatives&#13;
has become more pronounced as different South Asian countries grapple with common policy design&#13;
issues to guide resource flows between tiers of government, attract investors and enhance&#13;
accountability of sector institutions. WSPâ&#128;&#153;s regional presence and global networks make it possible to&#13;
assist creating links across national boundaries.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA Comparative Advantage: WSP-SAâ&#128;&#153;s country and regional presence make it possible to&#13;
develop trust and networks with clients. The fact that WSPâ&#128;&#153;s operations are fire-walled from a&#13;
lending agenda positions it as an ideas broker able to offer advisory services in â&#128;&#156;real time.â&#128;?&#13;
Simultaneously, however, its global reach and relationships with the World Bank and other agencies&#13;
give it rapid access to global expertise to mobilize in support of clients. The move toward more&#13;
programmatic funding in partnership arrangements at the country and regional level has allowed&#13;
WSP-SA to be more responsive to client needs and emerging opportunities as well as more flexible in&#13;
dealing with political and bureaucratic shifts.&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Activity Selection: The focus is on Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, and four considerations&#13;
guide the selection of projects:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Orientation and commitment to reform and poverty reduction: Potential for an engagement to&#13;
    demonstrate the benefits of reform and roadmaps for change; points of entry and their links to&#13;
    systemic reforms; scope for upscale of reform, investment and service improvements; potential&#13;
    for direct or indirect impact on the poor; demand or the potential to generate demand.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Country priorities as reflected in key policy priorities and shifts, especially concerning&#13;
    institutional frameworks, approaches to service provision and behavior change.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Priorities agreed with country partners and donors, such as choices of location (e.g. lagging&#13;
    states, regions, provinces), and improving services to the poor.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Scope for knowledge sharing: Interest in exchange and sharing within country; scope to make a&#13;
    regional impact; opportunity for WSP to help make clients aware of experiences and hence&#13;
    opportunities for learning.&#13;
&#13;
Strategic themes and key projects: Across all three countries of focus, the emphasis is on catalyzing&#13;
institutional change at scale, around four strategic themes:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Enabling environments: WSP-SA assists higher levels of government to develop policy and fiscal&#13;
     incentives for reform to achieve accountability in service delivery. As this is often closely related&#13;
     to decentralization, we assist clients in relevant intergovernmental reforms.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Sector transformation: WSP-SA assists clients at departmental level (usually at central or middle&#13;
     tier government), or cities and utilities to develop roadmaps for reform: collecting and analyzing&#13;
     data; identifying trends; developing appropriate frameworks for responding to those trends; and&#13;
     outlining systematic timeframes and actions for reform.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Service provider reform and performance improvement: This includes assisting clients in&#13;
     identifying institutional options for reform (e.g. the choice between corporate providers and&#13;
     conventional municipal or middle-tier departments, private sector participation); introducing&#13;
     internal utility reform such as improving the planning, data management financing, budgeting and&#13;
     reporting processes and rendering services to the poor; developing innovative project approaches&#13;
     through design and project development at ground level and then feed into policy frameworks,&#13;
     guidelines and knowledge management forums.&#13;
â&#128;¢ Social accountability: Accountability hinges on sector institutions reporting transparently to&#13;
     customers, and the scope for customers to hold their providers and policy makers accountable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   64&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                         FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    WSP helps identify and disseminate successful practices in public accountability, and assist in the&#13;
    development of new approaches.&#13;
&#13;
BANGLADESH&#13;
The Challenge: On top of existing policy/institutional/service provision challenges that need to be&#13;
met in order to improve the current 75 percent coverage of safe drinking water and 70 percent&#13;
coverage of fixed-place household sanitation, the expected impacts of climate change in Bangladesh&#13;
are increasingly influencing policy discussions and development plans. The impact of extreme&#13;
weather (floods and storms) on water supply and sanitation services in an increasingly urban&#13;
Bangladesh needs to be understood in order for the sector to adapt to new constraints.&#13;
&#13;
The institutional reform agenda will be developed in a fluid political economy, especially as elections&#13;
at all levels of government (from national to local) are expected by the end of 2008. Structural&#13;
reforms, such as decentralization, may be re-shaped by the new leadership.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: The changes which are taking place in terms of the continuing urbanization, the&#13;
impacts due to climate change, or the transitions within the political economy also provide clear&#13;
opportunities to contribute to new approaches of service provision. Increased decentralization of&#13;
service provision in urban areas may be entering a new phase as a result of key reforms to smaller&#13;
town (pourashava) attributes being undertaken by the government. Successful horizontal learning&#13;
approaches in pourashavas, similar to those being undertaken in rural local governments (union&#13;
parishads) that match progressive leadership in both government and civil society, will be an&#13;
important input to build from good practices among urban municipalities. With the approaching&#13;
deadlines for reaching 100 percent sanitation (2010) as well as the MDGs (2015), there is also an&#13;
opportunity for generating greater focus on how to best achieve these ambitious targets as well as&#13;
how to sustain the achievements over the coming years.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA Role: To catalyze the above change, WSP-SA will continue to provide active advisory&#13;
services through 1) country-level dialogue with national stakeholders for a common ownership of&#13;
policies and strategies; 2) mainstreaming innovative pilots into scalable national programs; 3)&#13;
strengthening learning networks within the country; and 4) propelling the delivery of regional and&#13;
global expertise as well as exposure of Bangladesh stakeholders to best practices from elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA Comparative Advantage: WSP will continue to build from its strong past performance in&#13;
Bangladesh that has been characterized by introducing innovative approaches (horizontal learning&#13;
among union parishads; performance measurement of urban utilities), providing strategic analyses to&#13;
influence sector performance (medium-term budgetary framework; Arsenic Mitigation Policy&#13;
Advisory), and focusing on engaging local institutions to catalyze behavioral change (community-led&#13;
total sanitation).&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-SA aims to implement the following types of initiatives:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Support national government in policy and budget reforms through advocacy and knowledge&#13;
sharing in order to lay the groundwork for mobilization of additional sectoral investment;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Support implementation of arsenic mitigation practices and drinking water safety plans;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Support the increased capacity of decentralized local governments to manage WSS service&#13;
delivery models and learn from practices that have been successful elsewhere;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Support the National Sanitation Strategy by mainstreaming and monitoring total sanitation;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Support reform of urban utility service providers to improve efficiency and effectiveness of&#13;
service provision, accountability and transparency of providers, with a particular focus on improving&#13;
service to the urban poor and adapting to impacts of climate change;&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   Support city-wide environmental sanitation strategies.&#13;
&#13;
INDIA&#13;
The Challenge: Although rural and urban water supply and sanitation (WSS) infrastructure coverage&#13;
has improved, the quality of water and sanitation services is not commensurate either with the scale of&#13;
public investments in WSS or Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s high economic growth. WSS assets are poorly maintained and&#13;
services sub-standard, unsustainable and contribute to the widening gap between rich and poor. WSS&#13;
services have historically been provided either by government departments or state-owned utilities,&#13;
with unclear roles providing weak incentives for performance and customer focus. Policy targets are&#13;
unclear; fiscal support delinked from performance; performance disclosure, measurable performance&#13;
benchmarks, citizen involvement and consumer choice limited; and subsidies not clearly targeted at&#13;
the poor. Despite commonalities, distinctive strategies are needed for improving services in rural and&#13;
urban areas.&#13;
&#13;
Rural: Although India now provides drinking water to most of its rural population, service delivery&#13;
improvements are not operationally and financially sustainable. Dropping groundwater tables and&#13;
groundwater quality also threaten source sustainability. The rural populationâ&#128;&#153;s knowledge about&#13;
sanitation and hygienic behavior is inadequate, resulting in poor health, productivity, and lack of&#13;
â&#128;&#156;demandâ&#128;? for sanitation. New policies are needed to encourage operation and maintenance, water&#13;
quality and source sustainability, and effective institutional frameworks and incentives. Local&#13;
planning could address sustainability issues more decidedly, and monitoring and evaluation&#13;
frameworks better supported through more credible data and measurable, outcome based benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
Urban: Institutional constraints prevent urban service providers from delivering improved water and&#13;
sanitation services. Inadequate formal assignment of powers and institutional overlap weaken the&#13;
authority of local governments, and has kept the functions of policy, regulation and service provision&#13;
not well delineated. The consequences include low tariffs and poor cost recovery (with subsidies&#13;
benefiting inefficient service providers and those connected to the water and sanitation systems&#13;
instead of unconnected, usually poorer households); inadequate technical capacity leading to&#13;
inefficient and poor service delivery to customers; weak legal and regulatory frameworks and a lack&#13;
of robust monitoring frameworks, benchmarks and data. This has been disempowering both to service&#13;
providers and consumers.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: In both the urban and rural WSS sectors, there is an increasing recognition at&#13;
various levels of government of the need for reform, empowerment of local government and&#13;
community participation. There is a growing understanding of the need for realistic tariffs, cost&#13;
recovery, private sector involvement, and sustainability â&#128;&#147; all accentuated due to the fiscal crunch&#13;
faced by most state governments.&#13;
&#13;
Rural: The Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s key reform program, Swajaldhara, was closed in 2006, and there is a need&#13;
for new instruments to support sector improvement. The national government is designing a new&#13;
incentive fund, Sajal Gram Puraskar, which aims to reward local governments and communities that&#13;
achieve sustainable drinking water supply and encourage improved planning. The Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) has expanded to encompass the entire country. The challenge is&#13;
now to build the momentum and find new intergovernmental incentives for reform in the sector and&#13;
through the framework.&#13;
&#13;
Urban: The centrally sponsored Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) aims&#13;
to create empowered, self sustaining cities that can function as engines of growth and services. Related&#13;
policy initiatives are in various stages of progress, ranging from national urban sanitation policy and&#13;
state level strategies, options to involve alternative and private service providers, new approaches to&#13;
&#13;
                                                  66&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                           FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
institutional and technological choices in solid waste management, and the access of service providers&#13;
to financial markets. In more cities, consumers are becoming more involved in reform initiatives to&#13;
hold providers to account, while some of the reforms promoted by the Government specifically seek to&#13;
address issues of community participation and empowerment of local government. Interim reviews of&#13;
key programs provide opportunities to improve reform incentives.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA Role: WSP-SAâ&#128;&#153;s role is to provide active advisory services to support and enhance the&#13;
capacity of the client to undertake and sustain institutional change in the sector and create a credible&#13;
supportive investment climate in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of spending in the&#13;
sector. Four strategic themes run through the strategy: supporting the evolution of enabling&#13;
environments for improved service delivery and accountability; sector transformation; improved&#13;
service provider performance; and social accountability.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA Comparative Advantage: WSP-SAâ&#128;&#153;s advantage is that it works through relationships of&#13;
trust and networks with the client. Reasons for WSP-SAâ&#128;&#153;s credibility are (i) the ability to provide&#13;
technical assistance independent of a lending agenda; (ii) its ability to draw on international expertise,&#13;
including from within the World Bank; and (iii) the fact that it does not carry a brief for any donor&#13;
agency or approach, but is well positioned to bring national and international best practice to bear on&#13;
the design of government programs and projects.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA Strategic Activity Selection:&#13;
&#13;
Rural: In line with the WSP strategy the sum total of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s work in the rural context aims at&#13;
improving the enabling environment for reforms and service delivery, sector transformation, service&#13;
delivery improvement and social accountability. This includes advisory support to states and local&#13;
governments across local planning, institutional frameworks and policy shifts, and identifying entry&#13;
points from which to engage with states on their reform programs. These activities start often through&#13;
knowledge acquisition at the local level, while continuing policy dialogue with the Centre and States.&#13;
Aside from advancing sector wide reforms, WSP support also assists states and local governments to&#13;
develop systems/strategies for scaling up RWSS coverage, researching and developing approaches to&#13;
planning and improving local water resource management (WRM) and water quality management&#13;
(WQM), contractual and regulatory frameworks, and monitoring and evaluating program&#13;
implementation and outcomes,.&#13;
&#13;
Urban: WSP-SAâ&#128;&#153;s technical assistance entails policy support, capacity support, and knowledge&#13;
management targeted at institutional reforms for improved service delivery in Indian cities. To assist&#13;
the enabling environment, WSP works with the relevant national ministries and agencies and state&#13;
governments to refine fiscal and policy incentives for reform. Service provider performance is&#13;
supported through activities to reform WSS service provider governance and operational and&#13;
financial management systems and practices, including performance improvement planning;&#13;
improving urban sanitation services in low-income communities; mainstreaming services to the poor&#13;
and slum communities; and improving SWM approaches. Social accountability work entails support&#13;
around benchmarking, baseline studies, information flows, and citizen involvement in planning. The&#13;
national governmentâ&#128;&#153;s reform programs mentioned earlier provide opportunities for such&#13;
engagements to take place, and WSP-SA will continue to position itself as a partner working with&#13;
appropriate levels of government and associated institutions to improve the impact of reform&#13;
incentives.&#13;
&#13;
PAKISTAN&#13;
The Challenge: In spite of significant and increasing budget allocations by government for water and&#13;
sanitation, households remain the major providers of water and sanitation services in Pakistan. While&#13;
&#13;
                                                   67&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                           FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
self provision has enabled very high access to water and sanitation infrastructure (access to improved&#13;
water supplies is 95 percent, access to latrines is 70 percent) this has failed to safeguard improved&#13;
sector outcomes (i.e., only 20 percent of the population is estimated to be consuming safe drinking&#13;
water and practically no communities are safe from the risks of exposed excreta). The access of the&#13;
poor to basic water and sanitation services remains very low.&#13;
&#13;
The fundamental challenge is to develop institutions that are accountable to deliver services within&#13;
the framework of clearly articulated and effectively regulated policies. In 2001 the legal framework&#13;
significantly transformed the governance structures; however the highly contested political&#13;
framework has resulted in greater confusion in roles and responsibilities for the various tiers of&#13;
government. Clarifying and linking the â&#128;&#152;bottom upâ&#128;&#153; accountability of service providers to consumers&#13;
and the â&#128;&#152;top downâ&#128;&#153; accountability of the existing tiers of government is essential to improving the&#13;
sustainability of municipal services.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: The uncertainty that has resulted from a lack of clarity in institutional mandates,&#13;
structures, roles and capacities to provide improved WSS services has created a demand for technical&#13;
assistance. Experience from other parts of the region and globally could assist considerably, while&#13;
WSPâ&#128;&#153;s country presence creates favorable conditions for country specific support to improve sector&#13;
governance and related institutional frameworks.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA Role: WSP-SA is providing proactive advisory services to support the national and&#13;
provincial governments in strengthening the institutions responsible for WSS service delivery, within&#13;
the framework of Pakistanâ&#128;&#153;s evolving decentralized intergovernmental system.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA Comparative Advantage: WSP-SA is ideally placed to support its clients at a time when&#13;
simultaneous and iterative work - piloting of new arrangements, testing application of global and&#13;
regional knowledge, and design of new investments - is the need of the hour. WSP-SAâ&#128;&#153;s involvement&#13;
in the design of the new Local Government Ordinance and transition has provided a comparative&#13;
advantage to influence sector work in the country. WSP-SA has managed to maintain this edge as a&#13;
result of dedicated advocacy at the federal level, continued dialogue with provincial governments on&#13;
policy and regulation, and capacity-building support to local governments. WSP-SAâ&#128;&#153;s neutral status&#13;
helps it to ensure a process of continued support to clients, generate unique knowledge of global&#13;
value, and proactively assist the sector actors in setting certain long term improvements in motion.&#13;
&#13;
WSP-SA Strategic Activity Selection: WSP-SA will facilitate critical governance and administrative&#13;
reforms that enable various tiers of tiers of public sector institutions responsible for service delivery&#13;
to scale up good practices through their own, government, and donor assisted investments. This will&#13;
result in mainstreaming of good practices, building capacity of clients, and facilitating a discussion on&#13;
policy options that would create an enabling environment for adoption of project rules and&#13;
institutional models that could take the sector forward.&#13;
&#13;
The three strategic project focus areas for WSP-SA engagement in Pakistan are:&#13;
1. Decentralized Service Delivery, supporting improved policies and institutional arrangements;&#13;
2. Improving urban water supply and sanitation services by supporting improved accountability&#13;
   of utilities to citizens for equity, reliability and efficiency of WSS service provision; and&#13;
3. Improving rural water supply and sanitation services, with a focus on inclusion and&#13;
   safeguarding â&#128;&#152;basic services for allâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GLOBAL ACTIVITIES&#13;
A key aspect of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s effectiveness has been its sustained country presence and programs. Our&#13;
country level presence over time has earned the confidence and partnership of governments and&#13;
enables us to jointly embark on complex and time-consuming agendas of institutional development,&#13;
policy reform, and capacity building. Each of our country-based projects provided an opportunity for&#13;
learning: for governments, other donors, and WSP staff. In recent years, WSP developed a more&#13;
formal structure to leverage its strong on-the-ground knowledge at global and regional levels through&#13;
two mechanisms: Global Practice Teams and global projects.&#13;
&#13;
GLOBAL PRACTICE TEAMS&#13;
WSP identified Global Practice Teams (GPTs) based on the following criteria:&#13;
â&#128;¢ On-the-ground activities in at least two regions;&#13;
â&#128;¢ An area of existing or intended WSP global leadership of the selected agenda;&#13;
â&#128;¢ A high level of partner interest for both local action and global perspective;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Demonstrable opportunity to influence partner or Bank/donor thinking on the topic;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Demonstrable benefits from cross-regional knowledge sharing;&#13;
â&#128;¢ Regional commitment to co-finance GPT activities; and&#13;
â&#128;¢ Easy identification of products with high impact and short timeframe&#13;
&#13;
Since being formed in 2005, the GPTs have continued to strengthen global learning and knowledge&#13;
management, through promotion of more cross-regional fertilization and learning, the establishment&#13;
of a global vision and leadership on key WSS topics, enhanced knowledge sharing and influence on&#13;
other stakeholders and partners including the World Bank and IFIs.&#13;
&#13;
WSPâ&#128;&#153;s Role and Competitive Advantage in Developing Global Best Practice: WSP is particularly&#13;
well set up take a global perspective on water and sanitation issues while ensuring national relevance&#13;
of its products. WSPâ&#128;&#153;s comparative advantage is its ability to draw on its work with country&#13;
governments that span four regions, to develop a pool of global knowledge distilled from country&#13;
experiences. Such global analysis and inter-regional synthesis feeds back into more effective country&#13;
support. In addition, as a part of the World Bank Group, WSP works in coordination with the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
operations, relevant thematic groups (e.g., PEMTG and RWSTG), and other global programs (e.g.,&#13;
GPOBA, Cities Alliance). WSPâ&#128;&#153;s on-going as well as proposed ties with regional entities (such as&#13;
NEPAD and AMCOW in Africa, and SAFIR in South Asia), as well as its partnerships with civil&#13;
society/ private initiatives (such as WaterAid, SPARC, SEWA Bank, IED and K-Rep Bank) enable it&#13;
to disseminate as well as support use of the global knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
Global Practice Teams are drawing upon this unique set of advantages to advance their work in the&#13;
following areas:&#13;
&#13;
Â¾       Urban Services to the Poor GPT: develop and implement utility reforms to support&#13;
expansion of access to the poor; modalities of linking small private providers to utilities and&#13;
municipalities; addressing small private provider capacity constraints; mobilizing finance in the water&#13;
marketplace; and strengthening the role and voice of the poor in demanding access to affordable&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;
The Challenge: Providing adequate, safe, reliable and affordable water supply and sanitation services&#13;
in urban areas through accountable and demand-responsive service delivery arrangements, remains a&#13;
major challenge in much of the developing world.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  71&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                          FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Opportunities: As part of the dissemination process of GPT products, the team is identifying&#13;
potential venues for dissemination and discussion of these products. One potential opportunity is the&#13;
World Urban Forum in October 2008, organized by UN-Habitat. The Urban GPT has submitted a&#13;
proposal to the organizers to highlight the lessons from the Guidance Notes for Services to the Urban&#13;
Poor as well as some of the findings of an evaluation on slum upgrading being conducted by the&#13;
World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Urban Anchor. The practice team has also embarked on a process for identifying&#13;
frontier issues that will guide its next generation of products and will hold its second annual meeting&#13;
in Bangkok (April 2008) among representatives from all WSP regions to discuss and identify&#13;
potential themes, including the impacts of climate change on urban services, and the decentralization&#13;
of UWSS. A representative from the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED)&#13;
will also be in attendance and marks a new initiative by the GPT to increase collaboration with&#13;
external organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Selection: The Services for the Urban Poor GPT (UGPT) targets addressing some of the key&#13;
issues around this agenda, through drawing on WSPâ&#128;&#153;s global presence for knowledge generation and&#13;
dissemination in the following two areas:&#13;
&#13;
Â¾       Services for the Urban Poor. A broad range of challenges include subsidies, targeting the&#13;
poor, revenue management, expansion and densification of networks, roadmaps for institutional&#13;
reform, service options for increasing access by the poor, asset ownership. Global lessons and&#13;
guidance notes on implementing these lessons, a WSP flagship product, have been completed by the&#13;
Urban GPT for dissemination in FY09&#13;
&#13;
Â¾        Social Accountability of Service Providers. This platform is predominately focused on&#13;
strengthening the role of the poor in demanding access to affordable services at service level they&#13;
require. Strengthening both the voice relationship between the poor and government, and the power&#13;
relationship between the poor and the service provider is central to the sustainable improvement of&#13;
services. Much work is needed to understand further the ingredients of successful initiatives in this&#13;
area, the incentives, the information-advocacy linkages and the tools and strategies for improved&#13;
accountability to citizens and clients. Guidance Notes on Social Accountability is under preparation,&#13;
for dissemination in FY10-11.&#13;
&#13;
Â¾        Sanitation and Hygiene GPT: identify the current state of knowledge/experiences regarding&#13;
the relationship between sustainability of changed behaviors and sanitation and hygiene approaches/&#13;
programs; develop and implement a global strategy for communication and dissemination for&#13;
sanitation and hygiene knowledge resources. The Sanitation GPT brings to the global sanitation&#13;
community: i) field presence in over 20 countries in four regions; ii) a knowledge resources base on&#13;
sanitation promotion and support partners; iii) partnership with the World Bank on sanitation&#13;
components of major water projects, with the attendant opportunity to test ideas at substantial scale;&#13;
iv) extensive experience in regional, national, and global networking including organization of&#13;
conferences and workshops; v) strong tradition of fostering policy debate, through highlighting new&#13;
issues and approaches; and vi) access to leaders and decision makers in sanitation in a large number&#13;
of countries and among international development agencies.&#13;
&#13;
The Challenge: Globally, some 4,000 children die everyday from diseases associated with unsafe&#13;
water and lack of basic sanitation, and 2.6 billion people lacked access to basic sanitation. The sector&#13;
is often characterized by institutional fragmentation, incoherently expressed demand, inappropriate&#13;
products, poor services, unsustainable financing systems, etc. Moreover, sanitation is viewed by&#13;
government as a private household use, as opposed to most other infrastructure services, and most of&#13;
the sanitation solutions in developing countries have been built by the domestic private sector that are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  72&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                          FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
unregulated and have weak technical capacity. In addition to serious health implications, sanitation is&#13;
also associated with girlsâ&#128;&#153; education, dignity, convenience, and privacy. Sanitation is not only about&#13;
acquiring a toilet, but more importantly itâ&#128;&#153;s about sustainability of changed behaviors. Little reliable&#13;
knowledge exists with regards to the relationship between sanitation and hygiene promotion&#13;
approaches applied and the sustainability of changed behaviors.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: In all WSP regions, the sanitation MDG has raised the profile of the sub-sector&#13;
and provides an opportunity to innovate and scale up new approaches. Over the years, WSP has&#13;
championed several sanitation and hygiene approaches. In the Africa region, WSP has developed the&#13;
strategic sanitation planning and now is rolling out sanitation marketing programs in selected&#13;
countries. Additionally, it pioneered the PHAST technique for hygiene promotion in several&#13;
countries and facilitated a PHAST network in the region. In South Asia and East Asia and Pacific&#13;
regions, WSP is supporting community-led total sanitation programs in selected countries. In Latin&#13;
America, WSP has implemented the condominial sanitation programs in selected countries. In all 4&#13;
regions, WSP is supporting several PPP hand washing programs. The UN General Assemblyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
declaration of 2008 as the International Year of Sanitation has provided important impetus&#13;
&#13;
Activity Selection: The Sanitation &amp; Hygiene GPT is conducting applied research and share&#13;
knowledge and experiences across WSP regions on sustainability of changed behaviors related to&#13;
sanitation and hygiene promotion approaches and programs. The GPT, in collaboration with the&#13;
World Bank sector anchor unit, will prepare two WSP flagship products in the coming year, on&#13;
Political Economy of Sanitation and Sanitation Financing studies.&#13;
&#13;
Â¾       Finance GPT: improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public financial management&#13;
practices in the use of WSS-related public/donor resources by stakeholders and leverage additional&#13;
local/domestic resources. The Finance GPT identifies lessons from its strong country presence and&#13;
thematic work, which forms the basis for relevant analytical work about approaches and impact. The&#13;
Finance GPT also establishes links with appropriate global initiatives by development partners to&#13;
provide knowledge and allow for better harmonization of resources.&#13;
&#13;
The Challenge: Financing is often portrayed as a key challenge in meeting WSS MDGs.&#13;
Conventionally, finance is viewed as determining sources of funds for infrastructure investments and&#13;
many global estimates of financing requirements point to large funding gaps in public resources.&#13;
However, additional financing for the sector is not sufficient; the main challenge is also to build&#13;
country capacities to ensure a greater focus on efficiency and effectiveness in the use of resources&#13;
towards rapid and sustainable progress.&#13;
&#13;
The Opportunities: The main opportunities arise from the ongoing work in countries, both to draw&#13;
lessons and to facilitate country-owned processes for improved systems in the following main areas&#13;
of strategic importance:&#13;
&#13;
Â¾       Emerging emphasis on â&#128;&#156;aid effectivenessâ&#128;? and sector governance. The quality of&#13;
        governance arrangements and processes are generally held to be the key factors for improving&#13;
        efficiencies and development effectiveness in the use of financial resources. Action is needed&#13;
        on: i) decentralization and fiscal framework including development of fiscal mechanisms to&#13;
        provide the appropriate incentives and design of inter governmental transfer system; and&#13;
        public financial management including development of properly costed â&#128;&#156;sector programsâ&#128;?&#13;
        and establishing clear links between reforms, strategy and public budgets, within Sectorwide&#13;
        Approaches (SWAp) and strengthening countryâ&#128;&#153;s own sector performance monitoring&#13;
        systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  73&#13;
&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                           FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Â¾       Leveraging resources and enhancing sustainability. While the emphasis on leveraging often&#13;
        stems from limited availability of public resources, it focuses on internal generation of&#13;
        resources through user charges, with good revenue management expected to generate an&#13;
        operational surplus. This approach to leveraging also increases sustainability of services and&#13;
        creates a possibility of raising market-based resources. To support this, action is needed both&#13;
        on demand on supply side approaches: i) revenue management strategies, for improved cost&#13;
        recovery and expenditure management by autonomous water service providers; ii) improved&#13;
        design of subsidies, using output-based and better targeted to avoid crowing out of service&#13;
        linked to local private resources; and iii) facilitating domestic market borrowing in selected&#13;
        countries by addressing supply side constraints (creating bankable opportunities) and&#13;
        promoting policy of â&#128;&#156;financing spaceâ&#128;?.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Selection: The Finance GPT is leading the work, focusing on a synthesis of lessons and&#13;
experiences from country level support to WSP regions through activities in the two areas: i)&#13;
influencing the use of improved public financial management practices and tools to increase&#13;
development effectiveness in the use of sector (domestic and aid) resources; and ii) influencing the&#13;
use of WSS related public/ donor resources to leverage additional local/ domestic resources for WSS&#13;
and increase sustainability of WSS services. This will be done through specific products based on:&#13;
&#13;
Â¾       Mapping of WSP and other global experiences within a defined conceptual framework&#13;
Â¾       Analysis and synthesis of WSP experiences in country support in the two focus areas&#13;
Â¾       Sharing of global synthesis and analysis in the two focus areas through appropriate&#13;
        communication products, participation in experience-sharing events and inter-regional cross-&#13;
        support.&#13;
Â¾       Developing innovative financial transactions in the water sector, focusing on downstream&#13;
        project development activities including areas such as financial and legal restructuring.&#13;
&#13;
Â¾        Rural Water Supply and Sanitation GPT: analyze the link between multiple uses of&#13;
domestic water and improved sustainability of services and systems, gender equality and poverty&#13;
reduction and determine how to scale up multiple use initiatives. Rural Water Supply remains a&#13;
global theme as the majority of the un-served and the poor are still living in rural areas. With its&#13;
global-regional-national learning and implementation links, long track record, high professional&#13;
capacity and ability to maintain real-time contacts with key decision makers, flexible access to&#13;
international expertise, the Rural GPT is uniquely qualified to carry out this type of strategic&#13;
knowledge generation, learning and influencing investments on the ground.&#13;
&#13;
The Challenge: Of the more than 1 billion people still lacking safe WSS, about 80% are found in&#13;
rural areas. Meeting the MDGs will therefore depend to a significant degree on the extent to which&#13;
sustainable services can reach the large rural populations that are currently unserved. Sustainability&#13;
of RWS has been hard to achieve and the subsector is characterized by high failure rates, a declining&#13;
profile, low cost recovery, low or stagnant rates of increase in coverage, and few sustainable options&#13;
for service operation, maintenance and management. An emerging approach, Multiple Use of&#13;
Domestic Water, may hold potential for making significant improvements in the sector. Multiple use&#13;
takes a more integrated and diversified approach to service delivery that: i) puts people at the center&#13;
of service delivery by responding to their range of demands for water in their efforts to improve&#13;
livelihoods; ii) embeds WSS in a broader setting; iii) has potential to better articulate the link between&#13;
RWS and poverty reduction and gender equity, and improved sustainability; and iv) contribute more&#13;
broadly to the achievement of the MDGs in contrast to responding to the single, narrow MDG for&#13;
water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Water and Sanitation Program                                                          FY09-11 Business Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Despite the common demands of water for productive purposes, there remain barriers to making it&#13;
happen: i) policies in the sector focus on development of water for basic needs only, which emphasize&#13;
health impacts of improved water and sanitation; ii) governments, donors and NGOs often approach&#13;
communities with water supply systems for domestic and not productive use; and iii) the supply side&#13;
continues to develop and deliver rigidly-planned sectoral programs in which the different sectors&#13;
rarely talk to each other.&#13;
&#13;
Opportunities: The MDGs provide an important opportunity to look beyond the single sector goal for&#13;
WSS to contribute more broadly to poverty reduction, reduction in the prevalence of hunger,&#13;
womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment in addition to health related goals. To become more effective, however,&#13;
RWS provision needs to strengthen linkages with other sectors and to be embedded in broader&#13;
settings. Developing domestic water for multiple uses may hold potential to embed services&#13;
provision in a broader dialogue at the local level and improve engagement with other sectors such as&#13;
health, micro-enterprise programs, micro-finance, etc. To have the expected impacts however, water&#13;
supply services and systems have to be sustainable and provide reliable and continuous services to&#13;
support the multiple uses.&#13;
&#13;
Activity Selection: Based on the above challenges and opportunities, the global RWSS GPT strategy&#13;
is organized around the following main areas: i) expanded options for sustainable scaling up of&#13;
services; ii) strengthened institutional linkages for RWS provision by local governments and other&#13;
local institutions and processes; iii) placing RWSS services at the core of achievement of the WSS&#13;
MDGs, as well as impacting other objectives of poverty reduction, health, gender equity, implications&#13;
on program design and implementation; and iv) implications for policy development, program design&#13;
and implementation. The main categories of activities are: i) global learning advocacy and&#13;
partnerships; ii) conceptual framework, research and analytical work, models, tools and methods; and&#13;
iii) cross-regional, south-south fertilization. Knowledge generated from these activities is expected to&#13;
filter back and influence the way our clients plan, implement and manage RWSS services and&#13;
ultimately, scale up to meet the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
Productive use of domestic water (application to activities beyond drinking, cooking, and washing) is&#13;
emerging as an approach that may hold potential for reducing poverty and improving financial&#13;
sustainability of water schemes through increased incomes â&#128;&#147; i.e., making water pay for water â&#128;&#147; in&#13;
rural areas. WSP has carried out a literature view that highlighted work already done and identified&#13;
knowledge gaps that need to be addressed. The review showed that, though there is a growing&#13;
interest in productive use of water, there exist knowledge gap in many areas. In response, the Rural&#13;
GPT is in the process of developing a study (â&#128;&#156;Assessing the Link between Productive Use of&#13;
Domestic Water, Poverty Reduction and Sustainabilityâ&#128;?) to assess the incremental costs and benefits&#13;
of developing systems for productive use, the amounts of water required to support productive use,&#13;
and whether and the conditions under which productive use of water increases incomes. WSP is also&#13;
planning to leverage lessons learned at country level and build on the knowledge and experiences&#13;
from agencies working in this field to generate global knowledge tools, promote cross-regional and&#13;
global fertilization, provide a global platform for learning, advocacy and partnership and rapid&#13;
exchange of information to bring the best global knowledge to policy makers at local level&#13;
&#13;
Â¾       Communications GPT: enhance WSPâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to strengthen support for strategic&#13;
communication initiatives of institutions in response to demands of client countries; support&#13;
communication and advocacy interventions that respond to WSS challenges. Country clients in the&#13;
developing world could improve their communications capacities to implement strategic reform&#13;
effectively. The Communications GPT collaborates with the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s global programs (DevComm,&#13;
WBI, etc) and other sector institutions to distill lessons and share experiences on strategic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
communication for WSS reform and MDG advocacy; and develop innovative global communication&#13;
products and advocacy tools that improve communication of complex issues on WSS.&#13;
&#13;
The GPTs are building vital linkages with the World Bank through the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s various Thematic&#13;
Groups and with other partners as well as identifying national/ regional/ global constituencies in&#13;
which they can share and disseminate their work. The focus areas and annual work plans for the&#13;
individual GPTs are described below.&#13;
&#13;
The Challenge: Tackling WSS challenges calls for new ways of maximizing the potential of&#13;
communication interventions to support sector reforms, capacity building of clients, and knowledge&#13;
generation and dissemination. Success in policy reform, knowledge building, investment support and&#13;
advocacy activities call for such effective communication interventions, particularly since these tend&#13;
to be complex, involve political risk and require social change. For the Communications GPT, the&#13;
challenge is assisting its clients to make the most from strategic, professionally-managed information,&#13;
advocacy and behavior-change programs in order to effectively influence and enhance the impact of&#13;
technical and reform projects.&#13;
&#13;
Opportunities: There is now increasing appreciation in the WSS that achieving MDGs requires not&#13;
only technical intervention but also a significant increase in the quantity and quality of&#13;
communications, especially relating to aspects such as reform advocacy, public participation and&#13;
consumer information and behavior-change programs. WSP has been providing technical assistance&#13;
for the development and implementation of reform communications strategies (Kenya), and&#13;
strengthening the capacities of country clients to manage communication on sector/utility reforms&#13;
(India, Zambia, and Peru). WSP has also been supporting initiatives to sustain policy dialogue and&#13;
providing communication support to national/ local level sector institutions (Mozambique, Uganda&#13;
and Indonesia) as well as learning networks.&#13;
&#13;
Activities: The GPTâ&#128;&#153;s activities focus on:&#13;
         Â¾       Consolidating WSPâ&#128;&#153;s knowledge of current strategic communications approaches&#13;
                 into a coherent global program&#13;
         Â¾       Enhancing WSPâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to support strategic communication initiatives of&#13;
                 institutions&#13;
Specifically, in response to increasing demand from WSP partners and clients to enhance their&#13;
capacity for strategic reform communications and to support communication and advocacy&#13;
interventions that respond to WSS challenges, the Communications GPT has recently launched a new&#13;
project that consolidates its current approaches into a strategic communications program that can&#13;
increase its impact and influence on sector reform processes.&#13;

OTHER GLOBAL PROJECTS&#13;
In addition to the GPT projects, WSPâ&#128;&#153;s global portfolio includes projects with significant global&#13;
resonance and potential for scaling up. The sanitation and hygiene projects funded by the Gates&#13;
Foundation seek to effectively increase sanitation access and improve health conditions in several&#13;
pilot countries around the world, through: i) total sanitation and sanitation marketing approaches,&#13;
including implementing, evaluating and documenting these approaches (Indonesia, India, and&#13;
Tanzania); and ii) scaling up handwashing behavior, including conducting baseline assessment of&#13;
practices, institutions, capacities, etc., followed by a controlled roll-out in targeted districted, with&#13;
strong M&amp;E oversight (Peru, Vietnam, Senegal, and Tanzania). A critical component of these&#13;
projects is enhancing the scope of the impact evaluation, to ensure that the projects can produce the&#13;
compelling program impact and cost-effectiveness evidence needed to demonstrate whether these&#13;
interventions warrant the large-scale investments that diarrhea reduction and other health&#13;
improvements require. The Secretariat for the Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing takes this&#13;
agenda further, to provide technical assistance, promote cross-country learning, and conduct&#13;
advocacy at various international and regional fora. Similarly, the Development Marketplace (DM)&#13;
project seeks to evaluate and help improve DM-funded projectsâ&#128;&#153; performance, sustainability and&#13;
potential for scaling up. IBNET is a joint World Bank-DfID project which has become the largest&#13;
public database, linking performance data of over 2,500 water utilities in 95 countries.&#13;

            This document presents the Water and
            Sanitation Program (WSP) FY09-11 business plan. The three
            year business plan is developed within the context of WSP&#146;s
            new draft global strategy for 2009-2018, which identifies
            the program's long-term priorities and directions and
            further provides strategic guidance to WSP's
            medium-term subsector strategies. The FY09-11 business plan
            is divided into six sections: a global framework, four
            regional chapters following the organizational structure of
            WSP (Africa, East Asia/ Pacific, Latin America/ Caribbean,
            and South Asia), and the global activities. Each regional
            chapter includes a regional strategy that outlines the
            particular challenges, opportunities, and strategies for the
            water and sanitation (WSS) sector in that region. The report
            concludes with an Annex(FY09 budget by project), a list of
            tables, and list of figures.
