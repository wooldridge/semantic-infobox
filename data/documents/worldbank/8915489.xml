&#13;
This evaluation report was prepared for WBI under the overall guidance of Marlaine E.&#13;
Lockheed, Manager (retired) and Nidhi Khattri, Acting Manager, World Bank Institute&#13;
Evaluation Group (IEG). It was prepared by Violaine Le Rouzic with contributions from&#13;
Adiza Lamien/Ouando, whose extraordinary data collection efforts in Burkina Faso made&#13;
the study possible, Elisabeth De Meûter, Audra Epstein, Daifeng Han, Phuong Nguyen,&#13;
Denis Nikitin, Katherine O'Connor, Jonathan Richter, Zarema Seydametova, and&#13;
Stephan Van Praet (IEG). The report benefited greatly from discussions with Guy Darlan&#13;
(WBI RCET), Gita Gopal (WBI Gender Coordinator), Heidi Zia, Nidhi Khattri, Jaime&#13;
Quizon, Chaoying Liu, Cristina Ling Chard and Zhengfang Shi (IEG). Guy Darlan and&#13;
Gita Gopal also served as peer reviewers. Humberto Diaz (IEG) contributed to document&#13;
production.    The author is very grateful to the resident mission staff in Burkina Faso,&#13;
notably Jean Mazurelle and Célestin Bado, for their generous help with the local data&#13;
collection; the six operational staff who agreed to be interviewed; the 20 members of&#13;
WBI activities teams who answered the TTL survey; and last but not least the 145 alumni&#13;
who completed the participant survey with special thanks to the 29 who provided&#13;
additional input during focus groups and interviews.&#13;

                            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
1. This report is part of a series of country-focus baseline evaluations undertaken by the&#13;
Institute Evaluation Group to assess the perceived impact of WBI activities on their&#13;
alumni, and through them on their organizations and countries, before or just when WBI&#13;
started to implement its country-focus approach. The current report is on Burkina Faso.&#13;
&#13;
2. The report aims to assess how country-focused, relevant, effective, useful, influential,&#13;
and sustainable observed WBI learning activities were, and which factors boosted or&#13;
mitigated their performance. The study also explores the early effects of the country-&#13;
focus approach and highlights gender issues.&#13;
&#13;
3. The analysis--both quantitative and qualitative--is based on five data sources:&#13;
&#13;
     · A survey of all 284 Burkinabè alumni in 51 WBI FY02-03 activities yielding 145&#13;
        responses (51 percent) and representing 42 activities (82 percent)&#13;
&#13;
     · Four focus groups with a total of 29 former participants&#13;
     · A survey of the Task Team Leaders of the 42 WBI activities collecting factual&#13;
        country-focus related information on 36 activities (86 percent response rate)&#13;
&#13;
     · Individual interviews with six operational Task Team Leaders--four of them&#13;
        based in Ouagadougou--involved in IDA projects for Burkina Faso&#13;
     · Document reviews, including Burkina Faso's 2000 Country Assistance Strategy,&#13;
        the Projects Portal, the Learning Catalog and WBI Client Registration System.&#13;
&#13;
               DESCRIPTIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE OBSERVED ACTIVITIES&#13;
&#13;
4. The activities studied had the following characteristics:&#13;
&#13;
     · Weakly country-focused for Burkina Faso: As expected in this baseline study, the&#13;
        vast majority of observed activities had a low "country-focus index" for Burkina&#13;
        Faso. This indicator was specially designed for this study and was based on&#13;
        features of activities that WBI TTLs considered to be country-focused for Burkina&#13;
        Faso: strongly involved stakeholders in the country and in Operations, had&#13;
        contents customized for the country, included a large number of Burkinabè&#13;
        participants, and were followed by another WBI learning activity.&#13;
&#13;
     · Only partially aligned with Operations: On paper, 64 percent of the WBI thematic&#13;
        programs in which Burkinabè participated were aligned with International&#13;
        Development Association's Operations. Regional staff, however, found the&#13;
        alignment weak, and WBI TTLs reported that only 39 percent of the activities&#13;
        supported, or were a part of, a World Bank Operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        ix&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    · Relevant to the country's needs, but less relevant to participant's work:&#13;
       Participant ratings of activity relevance to the country's needs were high (5.97 on&#13;
       a 7-point scale), but some focus group participants felt that relevance was poor.&#13;
       Ratings for the relevance to work were lower--on average 5.22 out of 7.&#13;
&#13;
    · Relatively effective: On average, participants rated effectiveness 5.24 out of 7, but&#13;
       with broad variations across areas.&#13;
&#13;
    · Used by participants: On average, participants rated use 5.01 on a scale of 1 (not&#13;
       at all) to 7 (very often). WBI activities resulted in participants' greater confidence,&#13;
       increased knowledge and skills and networking. Some institutions improved their&#13;
       methods. Knowledge and tools were used to develop national strategies.&#13;
&#13;
    · Brought positive changes: with an average of 5.33 on a scale of 1 (strong negative&#13;
       change) to 7 (strong positive change). Alumni notably felt that WBI helped&#13;
       improve the interaction between government and civil society.&#13;
&#13;
    · Involved limited follow-up: only 15 percent of the participants reported any&#13;
       follow-up by WBI. Even fewer alumni (9 percent) contacted WBI after the&#13;
       activity and their satisfaction with the Institute's responses were mixed.&#13;
&#13;
    · Mostly not addressing gender issues: TTLs said that 11 percent of their activities&#13;
       had "raising participant awareness of gender issues" as a major objective.&#13;
       Participants felt that "promoting gender equality and empowering women" ranked&#13;
       among the last in the list of development goals addressed by WBI activities.&#13;
&#13;
                            ACTIVITY PERFORMANCE FACTORS&#13;
&#13;
5. The report examined the factors explaining activity performance in five areas:&#13;
relevance to Burkina Faso's needs, relevance to participants' work, effectiveness, use of&#13;
the knowledge and skills by participants, and perceived changes induced by the activities.&#13;
These relationships are summarized below using both quantitative and qualitative results.&#13;
&#13;
6. The intuitive logic according to which relevance increases effectiveness, that leads to&#13;
larger use and in turn greater change was only partially confirmed by this study.&#13;
However, the following activity features were associated with higher performance:&#13;
&#13;
    · Involving clients, local partners and Bank Operations: Being more "country-&#13;
       focused" on Burkina Faso in some cases led to greater effectiveness and use.&#13;
       Closely working with a Burkinabè partner organization led to more positive&#13;
       changes. Operations staff reported that more frequent communication with better&#13;
       follow-up between WBI and Operations would improve the relevance of WBI&#13;
       activities to the country's needs.&#13;
&#13;
    · Being relevant: A content neither too technical nor too academic that is relevant&#13;
       to participants' work increased effectiveness and use. Addressing more country&#13;
       development goals boosted effectiveness. "Policy service" (rather than "skill-&#13;
       building") activities designed to help solve some of Burkina Faso's problems&#13;
       were associated with higher relevance to the country's needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
x&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     · Expanding the activity beyond its delivery: Developing an action plan during the&#13;
       activity to apply the new knowledge once back to work increased the relevance to&#13;
       work, the use of what was learned and the reported changes induced by the&#13;
       activity. Following up, inviting the same participants to subsequent WBI&#13;
       activities, and involving a local partner helped to induce greater change.&#13;
&#13;
     · Selecting a diverse group of participants able to overcome contextual barriers:&#13;
       Seniority was related to higher relevance to work, greater use and change. Being&#13;
       in an organization and function related to the area of use and feeling a supportive&#13;
       work and country environment increased use. Involving participants' senior&#13;
       management and inviting a critical mass of participants from an organization were&#13;
       mentioned as factors that helped to overcome change-averse hierarchical&#13;
       structures and improve use and changes. Inviting diverse stakeholders, notably&#13;
       having government officials work with the civil society or the private sector, led&#13;
       to greater change.&#13;
&#13;
     · Delivering in a language well understood by participants: Mastering the activity's&#13;
       technical terminology was associated with higher relevance to work and use, and&#13;
       working daily in the language of the activity helped promote change. Instructors&#13;
       insufficiently fluent in French lowered the effectiveness of some activities.&#13;
&#13;
7. In most cases, participant gender was not a factor in the activities' performance.&#13;
However, alumni found country-focused activities more related to gender. These alumni&#13;
were more likely to use what they learned at the activity to integrate gender in their work.&#13;
&#13;
                                   RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
8. Overall, the consolidated evidence from this report suggests that WBI should&#13;
strengthen the implementation of its country-focus approach for Burkina Faso. While&#13;
most observed FY02-03 activities had a low country-focus index for Burkina Faso, this&#13;
index was associated with greater effectiveness in developing strategies for change.&#13;
Suggestions for improvements provided by participants and operational staff support the&#13;
implementation of this strategy. Within this approach, more specific recommendations&#13;
relate to (a) work processes and organization, (b) activity features, (c) participant&#13;
selection, and (d) incentives.&#13;
&#13;
9. WBI could better serve its Burkinabè clients by implementing or strengthening the&#13;
following work processes or organization:&#13;
&#13;
     · Work with operational staff more systematically: Operational staff were often&#13;
       asked for occasional input with limited follow-up. Closer collaboration would&#13;
       help improve the alignment of WBI with the CAS and Operations.&#13;
&#13;
     · Involve local stakeholders: Working with the client country's government and&#13;
       other local groups was strongly embedded in the country-focus index, and&#13;
       involving a local partner led to greater changes.&#13;
&#13;
     · Establish a focal point--person or partner--for WBI in the country: This would&#13;
       improve the alignment with Burkina Faso's needs and make follow-up easier.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          xi&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    · Supplement the use of electronic media with paper communication and materials:&#13;
       Access to computers and the Internet is limited. Connections are slow and costly.&#13;
       This hinders the use of materials on CD ROMs and electronic communications.&#13;
&#13;
10. WBI activities could improve their relevance or impact using the following features:&#13;
&#13;
    · Adapt the content to participants: Relevance to work boosted effectiveness and&#13;
       use. Poor relevance to the country's context impeded use and change.&#13;
&#13;
    · Have participants develop action plans during the activity: Action plans were&#13;
       associated with greater relevance to work, use and positive changes.&#13;
&#13;
    · Follow up after the activity: Participants and operational staff found following up&#13;
       essential, but follow-up was minimal. Repeated attendance led to greater change.&#13;
&#13;
    · Address gender more often and more effectively: Gender was weakly addressed.&#13;
       The few activities aiming to raise participant awareness of gender issues were not&#13;
       more effective in it. Their participants did not integrate gender more in their work.&#13;
&#13;
    · Deliver the activity in a language clear to participants: French was often used, so&#13;
       language was rarely a barrier. Yet, participant mastery of the technical language&#13;
       increased relevance and use, and the participants who worked in the language of&#13;
       the activity reported greater change. Language fluency by the instructors matters.&#13;
&#13;
11. Selecting the right group of participants increases activity's performance:&#13;
&#13;
    · Invite participants in senior functions: Alumni in higher-level positions were more&#13;
       likely to find the activity relevant to their work, use it and report greater changes.&#13;
&#13;
    · Invite enough participants per organization and involve their top managers: to&#13;
       overcome colleagues' reluctance to change and apply what was learned.&#13;
&#13;
    · Increase the participation of representatives from the civil society and the private&#13;
       sector alongside government officials: WBI's ability to have various stakeholders&#13;
       work together was the underlying commonality among the examples of change&#13;
       provided by alumni. However, few participants were non-governmental officials.&#13;
&#13;
    · Invite more participants from the regions: Each PRSP pillar includes reaching out&#13;
       to local/rural areas. Yet, almost all Burkinabè participants lived in Ouagadougou.&#13;
&#13;
12. WBI should use incentives and systems that match the new country-focus strategy.&#13;
&#13;
    · Use indicators of WBI's full actions (beyond delivery) to encourage follow-ups:&#13;
       Current performance indicators are seen as an incentive to "produce"&#13;
       participant/days, limiting efforts towards following up with alumni.&#13;
&#13;
    · Use indicators monitoring WBI's collaboration with Operations: as an incentive&#13;
       to align WBI programs with Operations.&#13;
&#13;
    · Improve CRS data quality: Following up with participants requires good contact&#13;
       information. Yet, CRS participant data are often incomplete and misspelled.&#13;
       Having participant data entered by people who know the region would help.&#13;

                                1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
1.1     "In FY03 WBI's new leadership adopted a country-focused business model&#13;
customizing its capacity-building programs to countries' priority needs, applying best&#13;
practice pedagogy, maintaining a sustained presence at the country level, and&#13;
collaborating with key figures who can implement policy decisions."1 Burkina Faso is&#13;
one of the twelve focus countries selected by WBI and the regions "for knowledge-&#13;
intensive programs to enhance capacity in areas identified in their country assistance&#13;
strategies and poverty reduction strategy papers. These pilot programs are multisectoral&#13;
and multiyear."2&#13;
&#13;
1.2     The present report assesses the impact of WBI learning activities with Burkinabè&#13;
participants as perceived by various stakeholders, i.e., their alumni, organizers, and&#13;
operational counterparts. The observed activities were delivered in fiscal years 2002 and&#13;
2003, right before or at the beginning of the country-focused strategy. Therefore, this ex&#13;
ante report should be largely considered a baseline assessment, with some accounts of the&#13;
early move toward a country-focus approach.&#13;
&#13;
1.3     This assessment should be followed by an ex post evaluation of WBI's impact on&#13;
Burkina Faso's stakeholders, once the country-focus business model is applied in full&#13;
force. Taken together, the ex ante and ex post reports could establish the effectiveness of&#13;
WBI's country-focus approach for Burkina Faso.&#13;
&#13;
                                  EVALUATION OBJECTIVES&#13;
&#13;
1.4     The report is organized as follows. The first chapter introduces the evaluation&#13;
design, while subsequent chapters address the following main evaluation questions:&#13;
&#13;
     · How country-focused on Burkina Faso were the observed FY02-03 WBI&#13;
        activities? (Chapter Two)&#13;
&#13;
     · How relevant were these activities? (Chapter Three)&#13;
     · How effective were these activities? (Chapter Four)&#13;
     · What were their outcomes? (Chapter Five)&#13;
&#13;
     · What changes did they induce? (Chapter Six)&#13;
     · Are WBI activities sustainable? (Chapter Seven)&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
1.5     The crosscutting question "Does `Country-Focus' make a difference?" is included&#13;
throughout the analysis. Chapter Eight synthesizes the main findings and offers&#13;
recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
1.6     Since Burkina Faso will become a gender-focus country in FY05, to collect&#13;
baseline information on gender in WBI activities and its effect, questions or probes were&#13;
embedded into each data collection instrument. Gender-related findings, wherever they&#13;
exist, are included in the analysis of the above key evaluation questions.&#13;
&#13;
                               EVALUATION METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
1.7     The data stem from five sources: a participant survey, a WBI Task Team Leader&#13;
survey, participant focus groups and interviews, interviews of operational staff, and&#13;
document reviews. The objectives, scope, collection method, and representation are&#13;
discussed for each data source below. The analysis triangulates these data to answer each&#13;
key evaluation question.&#13;
&#13;
1.8     The report uses both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Quantitative analysis&#13;
methods include descriptive, t-test, chi-squares, z scores, correlations, factor analyses,&#13;
and multivariate linear regressions. Each method is presented with its respective analysis.&#13;
&#13;
Participant survey&#13;
&#13;
1.9     A survey asked former participants to rate the relevance, effectiveness, usefulness&#13;
and perceived impact of the last WBI activity they attended in FY02-03. Alumni were&#13;
asked to compare WBI activities with similar activities offered by other organizations.&#13;
Participants provided the following information on the characteristics of the activity they&#13;
attended: whether or not there was an action plan, a follow-up, and a list documenting the&#13;
coordinates of their fellow participants. Finally, they provided information about&#13;
themselves, i.e., their language proficiency at the time of the activity, their gender; and&#13;
since the activity: the type of organization in which they have worked, their main work,&#13;
and their level of seniority. All questions in the surveys were closed-ended with the&#13;
exception of the last one which asked for commentary. Those comments are also&#13;
integrated in the analysis. The full questionnaire can be found in annex 1.&#13;
&#13;
1.10    The participant survey data collection took place between December 2003 and&#13;
February 2004. A local consultant was hired to contact the participants and collect their&#13;
responses. To encourage a high response rate, an incentive was built into the contract for&#13;
the local consultant. She was paid per completed survey with a 30 percent bonus if the&#13;
response rate reached or exceeded 70 percent.&#13;
&#13;
1.11    As this situation created an incentive for the local consultant to complete some of&#13;
the surveys by herself, the local consultant signed a promise of professional performance&#13;
(annex 2) upon hiring. Quality control was executed through a telephone survey of a&#13;
random sample of ten percent of the respondents. No issues with the data collection were&#13;
revealed. Further quality control measures included a web-based replica of the paper&#13;
survey for correct keying of the responses, and independent double data entry followed&#13;
by a thorough examination the discrepant data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Response rate of the participant survey&#13;
&#13;
1.12    To enable meaningful quantitative analysis, we decided to survey the entire&#13;
population of the 408 records of alumni whose records met the following four criteria&#13;
(a) marked as Burkinabè citizen or citizen from an unidentified country, (b) living in&#13;
Burkina Faso, (c) with a name, and (d) at least one of the following:&#13;
&#13;
     · organization name (64 records included only the organization name, not its&#13;
        address; out of these 11 responded to the survey)&#13;
&#13;
     · street address or post office box number&#13;
&#13;
     · a phone number, and/or&#13;
     · an e-mail address&#13;
&#13;
1.13    After checking the participant data issued from the Client Registration System&#13;
(CRS), we excluded 124 of the 408 records for the following reasons:&#13;
&#13;
     · 41 (10 percent) duplicate records of the same person (despite different IDs)&#13;
&#13;
     · 39 did not attend training&#13;
     · 25 had incorrect addresses and could not be located&#13;
     · 10 were not Burkinabè citizens&#13;
&#13;
     · 8 had left the country&#13;
     · 1 was deceased&#13;
&#13;
1.14    This procedure left a valid list of 284 potential respondents. Out of them, 145&#13;
completed the participant survey, a 51% response rate. The aggregated participant&#13;
responses are in annex 3.&#13;
&#13;
Instrument description and mode of data collection&#13;
&#13;
1.15    The activity's title, dates, location, and participant nominee ID were printed on&#13;
each survey so that we could associate the participants' responses with their demographic&#13;
information in the CRS and the features of the activity they attended. When a participant&#13;
was an alumnus of several activities, s/he was asked to evaluate the most recent offering.&#13;
&#13;
1.16    Since 232 of the 408 (57 percent) initial participant records included e-mail&#13;
addresses, an electronic survey was also programmed to provide the choice of answering&#13;
on paper or electronically. However, none of the participants responded electronically.&#13;
The local data collector reported that the vast majority of Burkinabè participants had&#13;
listed an e-mail address that was not theirs, but the address of a senior person in their&#13;
organization. In many cases only senior people have access to computers with e-mail,&#13;
although they do not necessarily have the computer skills to use them. In addition, the&#13;
Internet is slow and expensive in Burkina Faso.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Who answered the survey? How representative were they of the surveyed population?&#13;
&#13;
1.17    Of the 145 respondents, 77 percent were male and 51 percent worked for the&#13;
national/central government. About 10 percent worked in the media or for NGOs. Other&#13;
organizational affiliations accounted for fewer than 7 percent of respondents, each.&#13;

directions." Twenty-three percent said they had "power of information, sensitization and&#13;
mobilization." Only 9 percent had decision-making power either in strategic directions or&#13;
technical options. Eighteen percent reported to be in a position to decide upon or&#13;
influence strategic directions.&#13;

1.21     Assuming that the respondents were representative of the population of Burkinabè&#13;
participants, the composition of the group indicate that the offerings were "inclusive ... at&#13;
all levels of society, business and government" corresponding to the group characteristics&#13;
of capacity development activities.3 However, the main audience remains senior and&#13;
mid-level national government officials. Although very senior decision-makers&#13;
participated in few activities, most offerings did not include very senior decision-makers.&#13;
&#13;
1.22     Besides describing the respondents' profiles, the following paragraphs compare&#13;
the 145 respondents with the 139 non-respondents to determine whether respondents&#13;
significantly differ from non-respondents, using chi-squares or t-tests.4&#13;
&#13;
1.23     In terms of representation, as recorded in the CRS at the time of the activity,&#13;
respondents did not differ significantly from non-respondents, despite a small over-&#13;
representation of government officials/parliamentarians and under-representation of the&#13;
private sector.&#13;

Which activities did surveyed participants attend? Did respondents and non-&#13;
respondents attend the same activities?&#13;
&#13;
1.26                     The 284 Burkinabè alumni attended 51 activities. The 145 respondents provided&#13;
feedback on 42 of these activities. This section examines the difference between activities&#13;
attended by respondents and those attended by non-respondents, with respect to delivery&#13;
modes, sectors, and thematic programs.&#13;
&#13;
1.27                     Participants in activities that used distance learning, electronic learning or a blend&#13;
of these media with face-to-face were more likely to answer the survey than participants&#13;
in activities delivered only face-to-face (figure 8).&#13;

&#13;
5Fifteen percent of the participants registered in the CRS appeared more than once. This relates to "alumni&#13;
activities" only, i.e., activities for which participants' names and contact information were recorded in the&#13;
CRS. The number of attendance per participant is likely to be higher, since participants could have attended&#13;
activities without being registered by name in the CRS.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
1.28                      A slightly higher share of respondents participated in programs sponsored by&#13;
WBIPR, WBIEN and WBIFP, while a slightly lower share of respondents participated in&#13;
WBIHD programs. The difference across divisions was not statistically significant,&#13;
however.&#13;

1.30     In addition, respondents attended longer activities (6.13 days on average) than did&#13;
non-respondents (5.25 days), and attended less-populated activities (40 participants) than&#13;
did non-respondents (55 participants). However, the average length of time passed since&#13;
the activity was the same for both respondents and non-respondents.&#13;
&#13;
1.31     Overall, respondents and non-respondents were alike in their types of&#13;
organizations, place of residence, and in the division, thematic program, and delivery date&#13;
of the activity attended.&#13;
&#13;
1.32     However, respondents were more likely to have attended longer activities, with&#13;
fewer participants, to have been recorded as alumni in a greater number of WBI activities&#13;
in FY02-03, and to provide feedback on activities that used some distance learning&#13;
media. The analysis will control for the variables showing a difference to see if they&#13;
explain relevance, effectiveness, use and impact. The interpretation will take into account&#13;
these differences when they are significant.&#13;
&#13;
WBI Task Team Leader survey&#13;
&#13;
1.33     The WBI TTL survey questionnaire in annex 4 asked factual information to&#13;
determine the extent to which the activities were country-focused on Burkina Faso. Since&#13;
Burkina Faso was one of the first countries to pilot the country-focus strategy in WBI,&#13;
some activities in our study were expected to be country-focused. Identifying the degree&#13;
to which the observed activities were country-focused on Burkina Faso and accounting&#13;
for it in the analysis were the raison d'être of the survey.&#13;
&#13;
1.34     Fifty-three activities were attended by the 408 Burkinabè participants. Among the&#13;
145 respondents, 42 activities were represented. The survey was launched on these 42&#13;
activities. When the WBI TTL was not available, the survey was answered by a member&#13;
of her/his team (25 percent of the activities). The list of activities is in annex 5. The Task&#13;
Team Leader survey was administered primarily electronically via Lotus Notes, with a&#13;
few face-to-face interviews, or via fax for those on missions or who had left the World&#13;
Bank since the time of the activity.&#13;
&#13;
Response rate of the WBI TTL survey&#13;
&#13;
1.35     Information was collected for 36 out of 42 activities (86 percent), which was&#13;
added to the data records of 136 out of 145 respondents to the participant survey (94&#13;
percent). This enables the analysis of the participant response taking into account the&#13;
information provided by the WBI TTL survey. The aggregated responses to the WBI&#13;
TTL survey are in annex 6.&#13;
&#13;
Participant focus groups&#13;
&#13;
1.36     Four focus groups were conducted to provide further insights on: how participants&#13;
perceived the activities, examples of how they used it, what obstacles they met in&#13;
attempting to implement what they had learned, where they thought WBI could improve&#13;
its activities, participant willingness to pay for the activities, and whether gender was&#13;
adequately taken into account.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.37     In all, the focus groups included 25 participants. In addition, four participants&#13;
could not attend the focus groups and agreed to be interviewed on a one-to-one basis. To&#13;
protect their anonymity, their comments are aggregated in the focus groups. The views of&#13;
these 29 people (20 percent of the survey respondents) are synthesized in annex 7.&#13;
&#13;
1.38     The first two focus groups were conducted in March 2004 and participants who&#13;
had attended an activity of a specific thematic program--"Social Protection and Risk&#13;
Management" and "Attacking Poverty"--were invited.6 In addition, two focus groups&#13;
were conducted early in April 2004 with 14 participants representing other thematic&#13;
programs.&#13;
&#13;
Interviews of operational staff&#13;
&#13;
1.39     Six operational staff were interviewed about the alignment of WBI activities with&#13;
the CAS and Bank/IDA lending Operations, notably in the projects and sectors on which&#13;
they worked. The aggregate report of the interviews is in annex 8.&#13;
&#13;
1.40     The staff were selected because they had worked on operational projects for&#13;
Burkina Faso in FY02-03, and because these projects were related to WBI's major&#13;
thematic and sectoral programs at the time. Each was involved to some extent in WBI&#13;
activities. All have assumed Task Team Leader responsibilities. Four of them were based&#13;
in Burkina Faso and two in the World Bank headquarters.&#13;
&#13;
Document review&#13;
&#13;
1.41     A mapping exercise using the Burkina Faso Country Assistance Strategy report of&#13;
2000, the World Bank's Projects Portal, the Learning Catalog and the Client Registration&#13;
System provides a crude estimate of the alignment of WBI activities involving Burkinabè&#13;
participants in FY02-03 with the CAS and active IDA portfolios at the time.&#13;
&#13;
                                             LIMITATIONS&#13;
&#13;
1.42     In pursuing this report, we should keep in mind three main limitations: (a)&#13;
representativeness of respondents, (b) nature of the data, and (c) the pilot country-focus&#13;
index.&#13;
&#13;
Representativeness&#13;
&#13;
1.43     Of the 2,128 CRS records indicating that a Burkinabè participant attended a WBI&#13;
activity in FY02-03, only 408 (19 percent) had some contact information. Of these&#13;
records, 284 corresponded to unique participants who could be traced, and only 145 (51&#13;
percent) answered the participant survey. Despite the seemingly large number of&#13;
respondents for this type of study, the lack of contact information prevented us from&#13;
drawing a random sample from the 2,128 records, which limits the representativeness and&#13;
generizability of the results. However, the 2,128 records in the CRS count each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6This was collected as part of thematic program evaluations also undertaken by WBIEG. Data relevant to&#13;
this evaluation was used in this report too.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
attendance, while the 145 participant responses count only one attendance (the last&#13;
attendance as an alumnus in the observed period). Taking this difference into account&#13;
makes the size discrepancy between the 145 respondents and 2,128 smaller.&#13;
&#13;
1.44     In terms of activities, the representation is better. Seventy-four activities were&#13;
recorded with Burkinabè participants in FY02-03. The 408 records initially drawn form&#13;
the CRS included participants in 53 of these 74 activities. The sub-list of 284 unique&#13;
participants surveyed represented 51 activities. Participants in 42 of these activities&#13;
provided answers.&#13;
&#13;
1.45     The activities about which we collected information through the participant&#13;
survey were not a random sample of all activities with Burkinabè participants. In&#13;
FY02-03, WBI required that participant information be entered into the Client&#13;
Registration System (from which the list of surveyed participant was drawn) only if the&#13;
activity attended was longer than a day, over a specified budget, a core course, and not&#13;
largely delivered by a partner. For all of the reasons above, the findings in this report&#13;
should not be generalized beyond WBI's alumni activities with Burkinabè participants in&#13;
FY02-03.7 Besides, only the views of the Burkinabè alumni in these activities were&#13;
collected. In some observed activities, all participants were Burkinabè, while others only&#13;
had one Burkinabè participant. Therefore, the findings should also not be generalized to&#13;
the nationals of other countries who attended these activities.&#13;
&#13;
Nature of the data&#13;
&#13;
1.46     Most of the data comes from individual accounts, including self-reported data&#13;
from the alumni and WBI Task Team Leaders. The interviews, focus groups and surveys&#13;
were held months after the activities evaluated. Social desirability can bias self-reports,&#13;
making the assessment more positive than the real effects observed. On the other hand,&#13;
respondent memory could have faded, resulting in an underreporting of the effects&#13;
studied.&#13;
&#13;
Pilot country-focus index&#13;
&#13;
1.47     The country-focus index on Burkina Faso was developed and used for the first&#13;
time in this report. It is derived from the activity features that respondents to the WBI&#13;
TTL survey associated with what they perceived to be country-focused on Burkina Faso.&#13;
A different data set concerning another country and evaluated by different respondents&#13;
would likely have yielded a different index.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7 "Alumni activity" refers to an activity for which the training team was expected to include participant&#13;
names and contact information in the Client Registration System. In this report, "alumni" are former&#13;
participants in WBI learning activities with contact information in the CRS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 2. HOW COUNTRY-FOCUSED WERE WBI ACTIVITIES?&#13;
&#13;
2.1      The notion of "country-focus" includes a variety of characteristics. A survey&#13;
asked each WBI TTL whether the activity was focused on Burkina Faso and whether it&#13;
had features commonly associated with the notion of country-focus. The first section&#13;
explains the computation of a pilot "country-focus index" for Burkina Faso. The second&#13;
section uses this index to determine how country-focused on Burkina Faso were the&#13;
observed activities. The third section explores which variables from the participant&#13;
survey or their demographics recorded in the CRS are associated with greater country-&#13;
focus on Burkina Faso.&#13;
&#13;
                 WHAT DO WBI TTLS CONSIDER TO BE "COUNTRY-FOCUS"?&#13;
&#13;
2.2      The WBI TTL survey asked about various characteristics related to the concept of&#13;
country-focus. TTLs were asked: "Would you qualify the activity as `Country-focused'&#13;
on Burkina Faso?" Out of 42 activities, the distribution of responses was 25 no and 7 yes.&#13;
Six did not answer the survey, 2 answered don't know, 2 did not answer the question.8&#13;
&#13;
2.3      Country-focus is an approach that involves many elements. To determine which&#13;
elements were associated with the concept of country-focus in the minds of the WBI&#13;
TTLs, we correlated the activity characteristics from the TTL survey and from the CRS&#13;
with whether or not the TTL described the activity as country-focused on Burkina Faso.&#13;
Table 1 lists the 22 activity features significantly correlated with the country-focus&#13;
question.&#13;
&#13;
2.4      The correlations revealed that activities that Task Team Leaders considered to be&#13;
country-focused on Burkina Faso strongly involved stakeholders in the country and in&#13;
Operations, had contents customized for the country, included a large number of&#13;
Burkinabè participants, and were followed by another WBI learning activity. These&#13;
activities were also less likely to aim at helping participants to address the needs of their&#13;
organization and to be directly delivered by a member of the WBI course team.&#13;
&#13;
2.5      Assuming that activities are more likely to be at various stages toward being&#13;
country-focused, we created an index of the degree to which activities were country-&#13;
focused based on the 22 variables listed in Table 1. To avoid giving more weight to the&#13;
variables with large scales we standardized all variables, so each mean equals 0 and each&#13;
standard deviation equals 1. To avoid the loss of cases, we replaced the missing values of&#13;
the obtained z scores with the median. To respect the relative weight of each variable's&#13;
association with the definition of country-focus according to the TTL, we multiplied each&#13;
z score by the correlation coefficient of the original variable with the TTL response to the&#13;
question on whether or not their activities were country-focused. Finally, we computed&#13;
&#13;
8Some TTLs were asked to answer several surveys, as they had delivered several activities with Burkinabè&#13;
participants in FY02-03.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the mean of these 22 weighted variables to create a single variable indicating the degree&#13;
to which an activity was country-focused on Burkina Faso. A reliability check found the&#13;
country-focus index to correlate highly with the initial TTL responses on whether or not&#13;
their activities were country-focused (r=.82, p=00, N=32). This country-focus index will&#13;
be used in the multivariate analyses to account for the effect of being country-focused on&#13;
Burkina Faso.&#13;

                  HOW COUNTRY-FOCUSED WERE THE OBSERVED ACTIVITIES?&#13;
&#13;
2.6        As expected for this baseline study, the vast majority of the 42 activities observed&#13;
had a low degree of the features that composed the "country-focus" index on Burkina&#13;
Faso. The index ranged from -.34 to .80, with a mean of -.06, a median of                              -.18, and a&#13;
standard deviation of .30. Figure 11 shows the distribution of activities according to their&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      WHAT PARTICIPANT VARIABLES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH COUNTRY-FOCUS?&#13;
&#13;
2.7                    Participant variables, i.e., responses to the participant survey or demographic&#13;
information from the CRS, were aggregated at the activity level in order to put the same&#13;
weight on each activity. These variables were correlated with the Task Team Leader&#13;
response to the question on whether or not they would describe their activities as country-&#13;
focused on Burkina Faso.10&#13;
&#13;
2.8                    Country-focus was not associated with most participant variables, but for two&#13;
notable exceptions: (a) inviting very senior participants and (b) gender-related questions.&#13;
&#13;
2.9                    Activities described by TTLs as country-focused were correlated with activities&#13;
including at least one participant who described his/her position as highest level (r=.48;&#13;
p=.00; N=32). This is consistent with the notion that a country-focus approach requires&#13;
"collaborating with key figures who can implement policy decisions."&#13;
&#13;
2.10                   TTL defined country-focused activities on Burkina Faso were correlated with&#13;
activities that participants reported to be related with the MDGs of promoting gender&#13;
equality and empowering women (r=.44; p=.03; N=25) and achieving universal primary&#13;
education (r=.42, p=.03; N=29) (with the embedded notion of promoting girls education).&#13;
Participating in a country-focused activity was correlated with using knowledge and&#13;
skills acquired in the activity for integrating gender at work (r=.47, p=.02; N=31), and&#13;
with working for an NGO (r=.36; p=.04; N=32).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10A bivariate analysis was chosen over a multivariate analysis in this case, because of the small number of&#13;
cases available once the data is aggregated at activity level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.11    Although the TTL-defined activity objective of "raising participants' awareness&#13;
of gender issues" was not significantly associated with the notion of country-focus,&#13;
participants perceived the TTL-defined country-focused activities as more likely to&#13;
address gender related issues and are more likely to use the related knowledge. This&#13;
finding may be explained by the fact that gender issues are to be addressed in all types of&#13;
activities, not only those focusing on Burkina Faso. Therefore, activities focused on&#13;
Burkina Faso were just as likely to aim to raise participant awareness of gender issues as&#13;
activities not focused on Burkina Faso. However, specific gender issues differ from&#13;
country to country, so participants who attended an activity addressing gender issues&#13;
customized for Burkina Faso would be more likely to find the activity gender-related than&#13;
participants in an activity that addressed gender more generally or from the point of view&#13;
of other countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
           3. HOW RELEVANT WERE WBI ACTIVITIES?&#13;
&#13;
3.1      This chapter addresses the issue of relevance first, in terms of how well aligned&#13;
WBI activities were with the Country Assistance Strategy and the International&#13;
Development Association's Operations, and second, in term of participant perceived&#13;
relevance to the country and to their work. Third, factors explaining relevance will be&#13;
explored. This chapter uses data from all the sources mentioned in the introduction.&#13;
&#13;
        WERE WBI ACTIVITIES ALIGNED WITH THE CAS AND IDA OPERATIONS?&#13;
&#13;
3.2      A basic document review revealed that 86 percent of the WBI thematic programs&#13;
were roughly aligned with Burkinabè CAS recommendations, while 64 percent were&#13;
aligned with the IDA Operations. However, Operations staff reported that the overall&#13;
alignments were weak, stressed the need for stronger collaboration with the country's&#13;
staff and suggested that a focal point for WBI be created in Burkina Faso. WBI TTLs&#13;
also reported that few of the observed activities (39 percent) supported, or were part of, a&#13;
World Bank Operations project.&#13;
&#13;
Document review&#13;
&#13;
3.3      Twelve out of the fourteen programs with activities for Burkinabè participants&#13;
were roughly aligned with at least one CAS recommendation--an 86 percent alignment.&#13;
Nine out of fourteen programs were roughly aligned with at least one IDA Operation--a&#13;
64 percent alignment.&#13;
&#13;
3.4      We assessed the alignment of WBI's in-country and out-of-country activities for&#13;
participants from Burkina Faso with the 2000 CAS recommendations. The alignment&#13;
index was composed following these main steps: (1) reviewing and summarizing the&#13;
CAS recommendations by WBI thematic programs11; (2) listing all FY02-03 WBI&#13;
activities by thematic programs; (3) calculating percent alignment by dividing the total&#13;
number of thematic programs with both CAS recommendations and WBI activities by the&#13;
total number of programs with WBI activities. The computation of the alignment index&#13;
with IDA Operations followed the same steps using the Projects Portal to identify IDA&#13;
portfolio active in FY02-03.12&#13;
&#13;
3.5      Annex 9B identifies which WBI thematic program activities delivered in FY02-03&#13;
seemed to be aligned with the CAS recommendations and with IDA Operations. The two-&#13;
by-two matrices below summarize alignment with the CAS (Table 2) and with IDA&#13;
&#13;
11As described in The World Bank Institute 2003 Annual Report. Recommendations encompassing several&#13;
sectoral/thematic areas were classified under each relevant program.&#13;
12 During FY02-03, 14 IDA Operations were active in Burkina Faso, 30 WBI activities were held in&#13;
Burkina Faso, and 44 WBI activities with Burkinabè participants were held outside the country. 1,954&#13;
Burkinabè nationals participated in WBI activities in Burkina Faso, and 174 Burkinabè participants&#13;
attended WBI activities held outside of the country (annex 9A).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
3.6     The above matrices rely on a very crude association between the thematic&#13;
programs and the CAS recommendation and IDA Operations. For example, if an activity&#13;
was delivered under the WBI education program and an IDA Operation was in the&#13;
education sector, this was recorded as alignment. However, the IDA project might have&#13;
been in primary education and the course in tertiary education. So, these matrices&#13;
probably over-estimate the level of alignment.&#13;
&#13;
Operational staff's perspectives&#13;
&#13;
3.7     In their interviews, operational staff reported a lower level of alignment. On a&#13;
scale of 1 to 7 the six interviewees gave the alignment of WBI activities with the CAS an&#13;
average rating of 4.0. (See annex 8.) Four interviewees mentioned some signs of&#13;
alignment in the environment sector (2), poverty and growth (1), a few activities to&#13;
support the process of PRSP (1), and capacity enhancement (1). However, comments&#13;
such as: "we can hardly speak of a country-specific approach" or "there is no strategy to&#13;
build coherence between WBI activities and the CAS" imply that the overall alignment&#13;
was weak.&#13;
&#13;
3.8     All interviewees felt that their information about WBI activities was too limited.&#13;
Although operational staff were consulted with by WBI staff, WBI's requests for their&#13;
input were mostly occasional and lacked sustainability. Notably, operational staff who&#13;
had contributed to the design of the Country Program Brief wondered months later about&#13;
its status. On other occasions, operational staff who had played a part in learning&#13;
activities had seen follow-up neither with themselves nor with the country's key&#13;
stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                       17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.9       All interviewees stressed the need to strengthen the collaboration between WBI&#13;
and Operations.13 Three interviewees suggested that WBI should establish a local&#13;
representative in Burkina Faso.&#13;

3.10      The WBI Task Team Leader survey asked whether or not the activity supported&#13;
or was part of a World Bank Operation. Only thirteen of the thirty-three activities (39&#13;
percent) for which an answer was provided were described as such. When prompted to&#13;
name these projects, TTLs listed the first three Burkina Faso Poverty Reduction Support&#13;
Credits, the Basic Education Sector Project, the Competitiveness and Enterprise&#13;
Development Project, and the HIV/AIDS Disaster Response. Also mentioned were the&#13;
first three Poverty Reductions Strategy Papers and two pieces of Economic and Sector&#13;
Work, on Social Protection and Vulnerability.&#13;
&#13;
Participants' perspectives&#13;
&#13;
3.11      Respondents to the participant survey provided further information on the&#13;
alignment between WBI activities and the Millennium Development Goals or corporate&#13;
priorities. The survey asked, "Was the activity related to the country's development goals&#13;
below?" Alumni responses aggregated at course level to give each course the same&#13;
weight, revealed that the sample of 42 activities represented were highly related to three&#13;
goals: eradicating extreme poverty, developing global partnership for development, and&#13;
improving investment climate and finance.14 Promoting gender equality and empowering&#13;
women, ensuring water sanitation and supply and improving maternal health were less&#13;
often addressed in the WBI activities. On average, each activity was related to over four&#13;
of the eleven listed MDGs or corporate priorities.&#13;
&#13;

To how many of the listed country development goals was the&#13;
activity related?                                                          4.25         2.50         41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13However, WBI RCET reported that since Burkina Faso was chosen as a focus country, WBI has never&#13;
received an invitation from the Country Team to participate in a meeting or in one of its activities.&#13;
14Having "eradicating extreme poverty" most often listed can be seen as an indication of country-focus.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  HOW RELEVANT WERE WBI ACTIVITIES TO PARTICIPANTS' COUNTRY AND WORK?&#13;
&#13;
3.12    Two dimensions of relevance were included in the participant survey: relevance&#13;
to country needs and relevance to participants' work. The WBI TTL survey also asked&#13;
about the relevance to the participants' country. The Level-1 evaluation question on&#13;
relevance to participants' work provides a measure of the activity relevance at the time of&#13;
delivery.&#13;
&#13;
Relevance to country&#13;
&#13;
3.13    Overall, the FY02-03 activities were not "country-focused" on Burkina Faso, yet&#13;
they were seen as highly relevant to the country's needs. TTL rated the degree to which&#13;
the content of their activities was customized for Burkina Faso on average 3.37 on a&#13;
seven-point scale. Only six activities (17 percent) got a rating of 6 or 7. As our data&#13;
include many activities designed before the implementation of the country-focused&#13;
strategy the low level of customization is not surprising. Participants echoed this low&#13;
level of focus on Burkina Faso. Only 21 percent said that the activity they attended was&#13;
specifically designed for participants from Burkina Faso at the participant level. When&#13;
aggregated at course level, the rating fell to 12 percent.&#13;
&#13;
3.14    However, to the question "Was the activity designed to help participants solve&#13;
some of the problems that Burkina Faso faces (even if the activity included participants&#13;
from other countries)?" 91 percent of the WBI TTLs answered yes. When a nearly&#13;
identical question was asked of the participants, 96 percent answered yes. When their&#13;
responses were aggregated at the activity level to give the same weight to each activity&#13;
the percentage remained high, at 92 percent. Furthermore, the question "To what degree&#13;
have the topics covered in the activity been relevant to Burkina Faso's needs?" received a&#13;
high rating of 5.97 on average from 144 participants; when collapsed at the activity level&#13;
the rating went up to 6.05 out of 7.&#13;
&#13;
Relevance to work&#13;
&#13;
3.15    Relevance to participants' work was significantly lower than the relevance to&#13;
country's needs. Level-1 evaluation results were available for 34 activities. Eighty-four&#13;
percent of the participants rated these activities with a 4 or a 5 on a five-point scale at the&#13;
time of delivery. The average at activity level was 4.3 out of 5.&#13;
&#13;
3.16    Six to twenty-nine months later, participants also rated relevance positively. The&#13;
question "Since the end of the activity, to what degree has the activity been relevant to&#13;
your work?" received ratings of 5.22 out of 7 at participant level and 5.30 out of 7 at the&#13;
activity level. These ratings were substantially lower than those for relevance to country&#13;
needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                             WHAT EXPLAINED RELEVANCE?&#13;
&#13;
3.17    We conducted linear regression analyses to identify the factors associated with&#13;
higher relevance to (1) Burkina Faso's needs and (2) participants' work. Both questions&#13;
on relevance stem from the participant survey conducted months after the activity rather&#13;
than from the Level-1 evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
Relevance to Burkina Faso's needs&#13;
&#13;
3.18    Female participants with influential power over technical options (as opposed to&#13;
disseminating information) who participated in policy service activities and who said that&#13;
the activity was designed to help participants solve some of the problems that Burkina&#13;
Faso faces rated the activities they attended more relevant to Burkina Faso's needs.&#13;
&#13;
3.19    A set of OLS regressions (see annex 10A) showed that the variance over the&#13;
ratings of relevance to Burkina Faso's needs was explained by:&#13;
&#13;
    · having held since the activity a position with influential power over technical&#13;
        options for implementing strategic decisions, as opposed to the power of&#13;
        information, dissemination or sensitization;&#13;
&#13;
    · having participated in a "policy service" rather than a "skills building" type of&#13;
        activity;&#13;
&#13;
    · having answered that the activity was designed to help participants solve some of&#13;
        the problems that Burkina Faso faces; and&#13;
&#13;
    · being a woman.&#13;
&#13;
3.20    Variables not related to the relevance to Burkina Faso's needs were:&#13;
&#13;
    · the degree to which the activity was "country-focused" on Burkina Faso&#13;
        according to the WBI TTL composite definition of "country-focus"&#13;
&#13;
    · whether or not the activity was specifically designed for participants from&#13;
        Burkina Faso&#13;
&#13;
    · the number of country development goals addressed in the activity&#13;
    · the language of delivery&#13;
    · the kind of organization for which a participant works&#13;
&#13;
    · the type of work participants had carried out since the activity&#13;
    · the seniority level of the participants; and&#13;
    · the participant and activity characteristics in which the respondents differ from&#13;
        the non-respondents (i.e., number of attendance, group size, activity delivery&#13;
        mode and duration). This means that the findings were not affected by the lack of&#13;
        representativeness of the respondents in these areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Relevance to work&#13;
&#13;
3.21    Having developed an action plan during the activity and representing WBI's&#13;
traditional audience, i.e., senior national government officials with good technical&#13;
command of their fields, led to higher rating on relevance to work.&#13;
&#13;
3.22    A series of OLS regressions (see annex 10B) found that relevance to work was&#13;
explained by:&#13;
&#13;
    · having developed--during the activity--an action plan/strategy (e.g., work plans,&#13;
        strategy papers, policy documents) to apply the knowledge and skills learned&#13;
&#13;
    · being proficient in the technical terminology of the activity at the time of delivery&#13;
&#13;
    · working for the Central/National government instead of in the private sector&#13;
    · holding a senior-level position instead of a junior- or entry-level position.&#13;
&#13;
3.23    Relevance to work was not associated with:&#13;
&#13;
    · the degree to which the activity was country-focused on Burkina Faso (based on&#13;
        the country-focus index derived from the TTL survey)&#13;
&#13;
    · the type of work of the participants&#13;
    · participant gender&#13;
    · the variables in which the respondents differ from the non-respondents.&#13;
&#13;
3.24    In general, the overall explanatory power of the models was modest. In the&#13;
models about relevance to Burkina Faso's needs, the adjusted R2 range from 0.08 to 0.16,&#13;
while the models on the relevance to participants' work had adjusted R2 between 0.11&#13;
and 0.17.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            4. HOW EFFECTIVE WERE WBI ACTIVITIES?&#13;
&#13;
4.1        This chapter first summarizes participants' answers to the question of how&#13;
effective the activities were in a variety of areas, then explores the factors that explain&#13;
effectiveness, and finally describes what participants and operational staff perceive to be&#13;
obstacles to the effectiveness of the activities.&#13;
&#13;
    HOW EFFECTIVE WERE WBI ACTIVITIES ACCORDING TO THEIR PARTICIPANTS?&#13;
&#13;
4.2        Overall participants' ratings of the effectiveness of WBI activities were high.&#13;
However, the range of effectiveness ratings was wide. Questions related to the direct&#13;
effectiveness of the activity on participant themselves received higher ratings than those&#13;
related to the changes deriving from actions the participants would take in involving&#13;
other stakeholders (i.e., indirect effectiveness).&#13;
&#13;
4.3        The highest-rated dimensions of effectiveness were in providing knowledge and&#13;
skills and raising awareness and understanding. On the other hand, activities were much&#13;
less effective in helping participants to build partnerships or to develop approaches and&#13;
strategies to address the needs of their immediate work teams, as shown in table 5 below.&#13;
&#13;
                          Table 5: Participant ratings of effectiveness&#13;

&#13;

gender issues important to the activity?                  100        1       7        5.04     1.57&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
helping you develop contacts, develop partnerships&#13;
and build coalitions in the field?                         98        1       7        4.36     1.42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15The number of respondents to individual questions can be lower than the number of respondents to the&#13;
means because a mean was computed for a respondent as long as s/he had answered any one of the&#13;
questions that composed the mean.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.4     A factor analysis of the nine dimensions of effectiveness above identified two&#13;
factors: the "direct" effectiveness and "indirect" effectiveness (annex 11). The direct&#13;
effectiveness factor relates to the questions in which the activities affect the participants&#13;
themselves. They are the effectiveness in:&#13;
&#13;
      · "helping you better understand your role as an agent of change in Burkina Faso's&#13;
        development" (r=.83)&#13;
&#13;
      · "providing you with the knowledge or skills required to fulfill this role" (r=.81)&#13;
&#13;
      · "providing you with knowledge and skills" (r=.70)&#13;
      · "raising your awareness and understanding of the development issues important to&#13;
        Burkina Faso" (r=.64)&#13;
&#13;
4.5     The "indirect" effectiveness factor relates to the questions in which the&#13;
participants are expected to induce further changes by involving other stakeholders. They&#13;
are the effectiveness in:&#13;
&#13;
      · "helping you develop contacts, develop partnerships and build coalitions in the&#13;
        field" (r=.80)&#13;
&#13;
      · "helping you develop strategies or approaches to address the needs of your&#13;
        immediate work team" (r=.72)&#13;
&#13;
      · "helping you develop strategies or approaches to address the needs of your&#13;
        organization" (r=.72)&#13;
&#13;
      · "raising your awareness and understanding of gender issues important to the&#13;
        activity" (r=.56)&#13;
&#13;
      · "helping you develop strategies or approaches to address the needs of Burkina&#13;
        Faso" (r=.52)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                           WHAT EXPLAINED EFFECTIVENESS?&#13;
&#13;
4.6     Both the direct and indirect effectiveness of activities were explained by the&#13;
activity's relevance to participants' work and by the number of country development&#13;
goals addressed in the activity. However, they differ in that direct effectiveness was a&#13;
function of participants' seniority and type of work, while indirect effectiveness was&#13;
associated with participants' societal and work context. Interestingly, when contextual&#13;
factors were controlled for, the country-focus index was associated with greater indirect&#13;
effectiveness. Other activity features--developing an action plan, providing a participant&#13;
list, product line, and requestor--were not associated with effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.7     A series of regression analyses over the average rating of variables making up&#13;
direct effectiveness in annex 12A found higher effectiveness for:&#13;
&#13;
     · activities rated as relevant to participants' work&#13;
     · activities related to more country development goals, suggesting that participants&#13;
        perceived a more holistic approach to the issues as more effective&#13;
&#13;
     · participants         working     for     the     national/central       government        in&#13;
        management/administrative functions instead of for a university/research&#13;
        institution either teaching or conducting research&#13;
&#13;
     · participants having held an entry-level rather than senior or mid-level position&#13;
        since the activity.&#13;
&#13;
4.8     Direct effectiveness was not related to:&#13;
&#13;
     · the activity relevance to Burkina Faso: the degree to which the activity was&#13;
        country-focused on Burkina Faso, perceived relevance to Burkina Faso's needs,&#13;
        whether the activity was designed specifically for participants from Burkina Faso,&#13;
        or to help participants solve problems that the country faces&#13;
     · participants' perceptions of their context at work or in the country either as barrier&#13;
        or facilitator&#13;
&#13;
     · participant characteristics: gender, and mastery of the delivery language,&#13;
        including technical terminology&#13;
&#13;
     · activity features: developing an action plan during the activity, providing&#13;
        participants' contact information, product line (policy service, skills building or&#13;
        knowledge exchange), requestor (external client, Operations or other)&#13;
&#13;
     · variables where respondents differ from non-respondents: activity duration, group&#13;
        size, delivery mode, and number of WBI activities an alumnus attended in FY02-&#13;
        03.&#13;
&#13;
4.9     Indirect effectiveness regression models in annex 12B found higher effectiveness&#13;
for:&#13;
&#13;
     · activities rated relevant to participants' work and activities related to more&#13;
        country development goals (as in direct effectiveness)&#13;
&#13;
     · activities not having a respondent reporting holding decision-making power over&#13;
        the strategic directions in the field of the activity16&#13;
&#13;
     · activities that were country-focused on Burkina Faso, when the above variables&#13;
        were controlled for&#13;
&#13;
     · participants reporting that their work and country development context helped to&#13;
        use the knowledge/skills acquired at the activity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16This counter-intuitive finding may be explained by the fact that respondents might have perceived&#13;
decision-makers as barriers to change.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.10    Indirect effectiveness was not associated with:&#13;
&#13;
     · activity relevance to Burkina Faso's needs, whether it was specifically designed&#13;
        for participants from Burkina Faso or to help participants solve some of the&#13;
        problems that the country faces, and the percentage of Burkinabè participants in&#13;
        the activity&#13;
&#13;
     · activity features: product line, requestor, whether or not an action plan was&#13;
        developed or a participant list provided&#13;
&#13;
     · participant attributes: type of work, organization, seniority, gender and mastery of&#13;
        the delivery language&#13;
&#13;
     · variables with differences between respondents and non-respondents: activity&#13;
        duration, group size, mode of delivery, and number of WBI activities an alumnus&#13;
        attended in FY02-03.&#13;
&#13;
4.11    Overall, the explanatory power of the models was good, with adjusted R2 of&#13;
about .40.&#13;
&#13;
                            WHAT MITIGATED EFFECTIVENESS?&#13;
&#13;
4.12    Only few activity features constrained effectiveness. Language did not come&#13;
across as a hindrance in the statistical regressions over effectiveness. This is probably due&#13;
to the fact that 35 out of the 37 activities for which the data were available used French.&#13;
As a result 95 percent of the alumni respondents said that the language of instruction used&#13;
during the activity was the same as the language they used at work completely and&#13;
another 3 percent said "for part of the activity only." WBI's effort to deliver activities for&#13;
Burkinabè in French is remarkable!&#13;
&#13;
4.13    However, the focus groups, comments on the participant survey and interviews&#13;
with operational staff reveal that while participants' mastery of the language of&#13;
instruction was not an issue, in some cases trainers' mastery of French was an issue. "The&#13;
trainers did not master the language in which the training was organized," one&#13;
participant mentioned on the survey. An operational staff suggested that WBI avoid using&#13;
non-francophone instructors.&#13;
&#13;
4.14    In distance learning activities, interruptions in the transmissions or lack of&#13;
connection with other participating countries were also mentioned as factors having&#13;
affected the activities' effectiveness, notably in terms of time wasted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                           25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
               5. HOW WERE WBI ACTIVITIES USED?&#13;
&#13;
5.1     This chapter will first report on how often participants said they used the&#13;
knowledge and skills acquired at the activity; second summarize the main use at personal,&#13;
professional, institutional and country levels, third explore the factors that explained the&#13;
frequency of use for different objectives; and finally, describe the obstacles that&#13;
prevented greater use.&#13;
&#13;
           HOW OFTEN DID PARTICIPANTS USE THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS?&#13;
&#13;
5.2     The participant survey asked, "How often have you used the knowledge and skills&#13;
you acquired in the activity for the objectives listed below?" On a scale of 1 "not at all"&#13;
to 7 "very often," participants answered that they used the knowledge and skills for&#13;
implementing new practices in their work organizations the most and for influencing&#13;
legislation and regulation the least. The average use out of all areas was 5.01 out of 7.&#13;

5.3     Because participants perform various functions, they cannot be expected to use&#13;
the knowledge and skills in all areas listed. Therefore, we recoded each question to&#13;
determine the percentage of participants who answered that they used the course in at&#13;
least one area with a 6 or 7 (i.e., frequent use). About two third of the respondents (65&#13;
percent) reported a high use in at least one area listed, leaving 35 percent without any&#13;
area with high use.&#13;

&#13;
                                       WHAT USE WAS MADE OF WBI ACTIVITIES?&#13;
&#13;
5.5                       During the focus groups, participants were asked what aspects of the activities&#13;
had been most beneficial to them and how they used them. Their responses were&#13;
categorized below into benefits at personal, professional, institutional and country levels.&#13;
Annex 7 provides greater details.&#13;
&#13;
Outcomes at personal level&#13;
&#13;
5.6                       All but two participants in the focus groups reported having benefited at personal&#13;
level from the activities they attended. Increased self-confidence was the most common&#13;
outcome, since "knowledge is the root of self-confidence" one participant explained.&#13;
&#13;
5.7                       Participants also appreciated their exposure to a diversity of cultures and&#13;
experiences, which enabled them to open their minds. The third main outcome on a&#13;
personal basis was a better understanding of the poverty reduction issues, notably the&#13;
need to involve all stakeholders in developing poverty reduction strategies.&#13;
&#13;
Outcomes at professional level&#13;
&#13;
5.8                       One major outcome was participants' ability to use new or improved skills&#13;
acquired at the training, which contributed to better planning, budgeting, financial&#13;
management, and accounting. Better writing and interviewing skills for journalists led&#13;
one former participant to earn the "Prix Galian" for the best interview.&#13;
&#13;
5.9                       Networking was another major benefit. Contacts established at the activity gave&#13;
way to post-training collaboration, notably in writing a proposal to donors for financing a&#13;
project, getting a scholarship from the institution of a person met at the activity, and&#13;
being invited to attend another training session organized by a fellow participant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                         27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Use at institutional level&#13;
&#13;
5.10    Methods discussed in the WBI activities were used for institutional capacity&#13;
enhancement. The High Authority of Telecommunications Regulation used the&#13;
negotiation tools provided at the activity to create an environment of mutual confidence&#13;
between them and the telecommunications companies. In the education sector,&#13;
methodologies taught in WBI activities are used in schoolbook preservation, university&#13;
management, and teaching methods. The department of Strategies and Techniques&#13;
against Social Exclusion and Poverty of the International Labour Organization also&#13;
reported having made its approach better adjusted to the needs of its clients thanks to&#13;
WBI.&#13;
&#13;
Use at the country level&#13;
&#13;
5.11    Knowledge and tools gained at the WBI activities were used in the PRSP revision&#13;
process and the elaboration of sectoral national strategies and plans, notably in the fields&#13;
of social protection, health, education and water resource management.&#13;
&#13;
       WHAT EXPLAINED PARTICIPANTS' USE OF THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS?&#13;
&#13;
5.12    A factor analysis over the eight dimensions of use surveyed did not reveal clear&#13;
factors. Therefore, each dimension of use is analyzed separately controlling for the same&#13;
variables across eight models. Table 8 summarizes the models and displays the variables&#13;
that were significant. The models are in annex 13.&#13;
&#13;
5.13    Among the activity features, the preparation of an action plan/strategy is the most&#13;
likely predictor that participants will use the knowledge and skills acquired at the course&#13;
once they are back to work. Action plans led to higher reported use in research, raising&#13;
public awareness of development issues, implementing new practices in participants'&#13;
organizations, and establishing partnership among development agents.&#13;
&#13;
5.14    Relevance to work predicted use more often than did the context in which&#13;
participants worked or the general development context of Burkina Faso. However, a&#13;
favorable context is seen as important for implementing actions. Work context matters&#13;
for implementing new practices in an organization. Likewise, to implement development&#13;
strategies for Burkina Faso, participants felt that a supporting general development&#13;
context in Burkina Faso helped. On the other hand, relevance to the country or the&#13;
number of country development goals addressed did not predict any dimension of use.&#13;
&#13;
5.15    Seniority matters. In seven of the eight observed dimensions of use, people with&#13;
higher positions (notably the self-reported highest level) used the activities more than&#13;
people at lower levels of organizational hierarchy.&#13;
&#13;
5.16    Participants who had mastered the technical terminology at the time of the activity&#13;
used the knowledge and skills more frequently than participants less familiar with the&#13;
jargon.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

5.17    Participants' types of work and/or organizations predicted use in seven of the&#13;
eight dimensions observed. Participant work was logically associated with their area of&#13;
use, e.g., researchers in research, teachers in teaching, disseminator of information in&#13;
raising public awareness of developmental issues and in integrating gender into their&#13;
work, advocacy in setting partnership, working for the national government in&#13;
influencing legislation and regulation, and policymaking in implementing development&#13;
strategies for Burkina Faso.&#13;
&#13;
5.18    Implementing new strategies in the organization was the only dimension of use&#13;
where activity effectiveness significantly predicted use while organization and type of&#13;
work did not. Direct effectiveness was associated with use in research and influencing&#13;
legislation and regulation, while indirect effectiveness led to higher use in implementing&#13;
new practices in participant organizations, setting partnership among development&#13;
stakeholders, and implementing development strategies for Burkina Faso.&#13;
&#13;
5.19    The country-focus index for Burkina Faso significantly predicted use in&#13;
implementing new practices in participant organization once effectiveness was controlled&#13;
for. The only other occurrence of this happening is in integrating gender into participants'&#13;
work in the models related to the activity features, type of work, organization and&#13;
effectiveness models.&#13;
&#13;
5.20    Gender was significant in some regression models on the use for implementing&#13;
new practices in the organization and for integrating gender at work. However, the&#13;
significance came in opposite directions. Once their work environment was taken into&#13;
account women reported to have used the knowledge and skills less often than men to&#13;
implement new practices in their organizations. However, they were more likely to use&#13;
the activity to integrate gender into their work.&#13;
&#13;
                          WHAT MITIGATED PARTICIPANT USE?&#13;
&#13;
5.21    The overall work environment and Burkina Faso's development context did not&#13;
prevent most participants from using the knowledge and skills acquired at the activity.&#13;
Women perceived their country's development context to be more helpful than men did.&#13;
&#13;
5.22    However, strong hierarchical organizational structures reluctant to change;&#13;
inadequate fit between some materials and the audience in terms of relevance to the&#13;
context of Burkina Faso and technical or academic content; lack of action plans; and&#13;
uneasy access to electronic media prevented some participants from using the knowledge&#13;
and skills acquired at the activity. Participants and operational staff suggested the&#13;
following strategies as a means to overcome these obstacles: involve a critical mass of&#13;
participants per organization including senior management, assign participants action&#13;
plans relevant to their work, follow up, and communicate through non-electronic media.&#13;
&#13;
5.23    Participants were asked to assess the degree to which contextual factors helped or&#13;
hurt the process of using the knowledge and skills that they acquired at the activity. The&#13;
scale went from 1 "greatly hurt" to 7 "greatly helped" with 4 being "neither helped not&#13;
hurt." On average, respondents found the work context (e.g., work procedure, colleagues,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
incentive systems, funding) slightly favorable (4.35), and the country's development&#13;
context (e.g., country policies, social groups, political groups, readiness for reform)&#13;
slightly more favorable (4.64).&#13;
&#13;
5.24             As shown in figure 13, the distribution of ratings was wide. In both questions, 30&#13;
percent of the respondents stated that the context was not a factor. Almost twice as many&#13;
participants felt the context helped more than it hurt. Only about a quarter found the&#13;
context to be a hindrance in using the knowledge and skills.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
5.25             Women rated their country's development context more positively than did men&#13;
(5.33 and 4.44 respectively), while they rated their work context slightly (but not&#13;
significantly) lower than men, (4.26 and 4.38 respectively).&#13;
&#13;
5.26             Although a minority, the quarter of respondents who felt that their work context&#13;
hurt their use of the knowledge and skills acquired at the activity mentioned the&#13;
hierarchical structure of their organization as a major hindrance. This confirms the&#13;
regression analysis results above, in which participants holding senior positions were&#13;
almost always able to use the activities more often than those in more junior positions.&#13;
&#13;
5.27             In a cultural environment reluctant to change, the fact that only few participants&#13;
per organization were trained prevented them from implementing what they had learned.&#13;
"It is not easy to introduce new approaches and concepts in the public administration,"&#13;
an alumnus explained. "The number of participants is not sufficient. The majority of&#13;
people in the organization did not attend the training. They are not aware of the&#13;
possibilities of change, and don't have these new methods and new vision on handling&#13;
development issues." Two operational staff also mentioned the lack of critical mass as a&#13;
barrier to participants' applying new knowledge toward change in Burkina Faso.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 31&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.28   However, alumni reported that sometimes WBI overcame these obstacles by&#13;
having a critical mass of participants attend the activities. "If the impact of WBI on&#13;
telecommunications is so noticeable, it is because the senior manager has himself&#13;
attended the training sessions and appreciated them. He has sent all his staff to WBI&#13;
learning activities on Regulation and has even organized training sessions for all the&#13;
telecommunications companies. There is a continuous relationship with WBI and training&#13;
requests every year."&#13;
&#13;
5.29   Although the overall ratings for the activities' relevance to the country were high,&#13;
when prompted to mention obstacles to their use of the activities, the lack of relevance of&#13;
some materials was mentioned. Elements of the training did not fit the context of Burkina&#13;
Faso, notably the case studies. Participants suggested that the content be tailored to their&#13;
needs, the needs of their organizations and to the country's needs. Alumni and&#13;
operational staff notably mentioned that some of the materials were "too technical and&#13;
not easy to implement" or "too academic."&#13;
&#13;
5.30   The lack of action plan, again confirming the results of the regression analyses,&#13;
was also mentioned as a factor hindering participant use of the knowledge and skills&#13;
acquired.&#13;
&#13;
5.31   Focus group participants and operational staff concurred that the use of electronic&#13;
materials and communication is hindered by the high cost and low speed of the Internet&#13;
connections in Burkina Faso, if they are available at all. When prompted on the&#13;
registration forms, many participants listed an e-mail address, usually their managers'.&#13;
However, they did not necessarily have access to this address, and sometimes not even to&#13;
a computer. In the public sector and civil society, PCs are more available for top&#13;
managers, but senior people are less likely to use them. This obviously limited the use of&#13;
CD-ROMs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
    6. WHAT CHANGES DID WBI ACTIVITIES INDUCE?&#13;
&#13;
6.1     This chapter will first discuss how participants perceived the changes induced by&#13;
the WBI activities, then describe the changes reported by the focus group participants,&#13;
WBI TTLs, and operational staff, and finally report what participants saw as weaknesses&#13;
in WBI activities that prevented changes from happening.&#13;
&#13;
             HOW POSITIVE WERE CHANGES INDUCED BY WBI ACTIVITIES?&#13;
&#13;
6.2     Whether asked overall or in precise areas, alumni rated the changes induced by&#13;
the WBI activity they attended positively, with some variation among areas. Changes in&#13;
research were more highly rated than changes in legislation and regulation.&#13;
&#13;
6.3     When asked to rate the change--induced by the activity--in Burkina Faso on the&#13;
main topic of the training, all alumni respondents reported either positive changes (79&#13;
percent) or no change (21 percent). None reported negative changes. The average rating&#13;
was 5.33 on a seven-point scale, with 1 representing "strong negative change," 4 "no&#13;
change," and 7 "strong positive change."&#13;
&#13;
6.4     In a more precise way, alumni also rated how the activity influenced or led to&#13;
changes in seven selected areas. The scale went from 1 "negative influence" to 7&#13;
"positive influence" with the mid point 4 meaning "no influence." Results were also&#13;
positive. Three quarters of the respondents gave a positive rating (between 5 and 7). After&#13;
averaging all areas, we found that 23 percent of the respondents reported no change. Only&#13;
between one and four respondents gave a negative rating in each area. As shown in&#13;
Table 9, the area with the most positive change was research, while legislation and&#13;
regulation had the least positive change. No clear factors stemmed from a factor analysis.&#13;

brought by the activity--in Burkina Faso  117         4         7        5.33      .96&#13;
on the main topic or issue it addressed?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        33&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                        WHAT EXPLAINED THE REPORTED CHANGES?&#13;
&#13;
6.5     Participating in an activity largely delivered by a Burkinabè partner, finding it&#13;
directly effective, relevant to Burkina Faso's needs and to current work, having used the&#13;
knowledge and skills, discussed the issues with others, perceiving the country&#13;
development context favorably, having developed an action plan during the activity,&#13;
holding a senior level position, mastering the language of delivery, and having&#13;
participated in more WBI activities in FY02-03 were all associated with reporting more&#13;
positive changes, once a series of features, notably the country-focus index and gender,&#13;
were held constant.&#13;
&#13;
6.6     A series of regression analyses found all of the above factors to be significantly&#13;
associated with reporting more positive changes in the main topic or issue of the activity&#13;
(annex 14). Because the number of times an alumnus participated in WBI FY02-03&#13;
activities was a factor in perceiving changes positively, and because the alumni with a&#13;
greater number of attendance in WBI activities were more likely to respond than people&#13;
who attended fewer times in FY02-03, the actual change brought by the observed&#13;
activities should be considered slightly lower than reported in the previous section.&#13;
&#13;
6.7     Activity features that did not affect how positively participants perceived change&#13;
in the country included the activity's country-focus index, indirect effectiveness, delivery&#13;
mode, duration, product line, requestor, sharing a participant list, and following up. One&#13;
explanation why following up does not seem to be associated with changes is that the&#13;
questions on the survey asked about follow-up by and with WBI. It is possible that the&#13;
follow-up took place at the partners' level.&#13;
&#13;
6.8     Participant gender, work context, job type and organization were also not&#13;
significantly related to their overall change ratings. However, as seen in the section on&#13;
use, participant type of work and organization matters when the question is analyzed&#13;
according to the area of use. Likewise, one should consider the change in specific areas&#13;
according to the participants' work. Since too few alumni answered the questions related&#13;
to changes in specific areas, we used a bivariate, rather than multivariate approach.&#13;
&#13;
6.9     Changes were seen more positively in the area of government. Policymakers and&#13;
people working for the national government reported more positive changes influenced&#13;
by the activity in legislation and regulation. Correlations levels were r=.33, p=.01, N=62&#13;
and r=.37, p=.00, N=62, respectively. Changes in development strategies for Burkina&#13;
Faso were associated with working for a regional government (r=.22, p=.03, N=100).17&#13;
&#13;
6.10    However, these positive changes in the area of government were not seen by&#13;
people--notably information disseminators--working further away from where the&#13;
changes reportedly occurred. Change in legislation/regulation was negatively correlated&#13;
with disseminating information (r=-.36, p=.00, N=62). Change in partnership&#13;
establishment was positively associated with national government (r=.23, p=.03, N=90)&#13;
while negatively correlated with working for the media (r=-.25, p=.02, N=90). Implicitly,&#13;
&#13;
17Changes in development strategies for Burkina Faso were also associated with higher a Country-focus&#13;
index (r=.21, p=.03, N=100).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
34&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
this discrepancy must be known by government officials as change in public awareness&#13;
of development issues was negatively correlated with working for the national&#13;
government (r=-.24, p=.03, N=87).&#13;
&#13;
6.11    Therefore, although changes in legislation and regulation received the least&#13;
positive ratings among all observed areas, the fact that policymakers and government&#13;
officials rated them higher than other participants could be interpreted as an encouraging&#13;
sign since they are more likely to perceive the changes first. Making these changes more&#13;
widely known may be a matter of time and communication.&#13;
&#13;
                   WHAT CHANGES OCCURRED DUE TO THE ACTIVITIES?&#13;
&#13;
According to participants&#13;
&#13;
6.12    During the focus groups, participants described changes induced by WBI&#13;
activities that occurred at institutional or country level (annex 7). The role of WBI as a&#13;
catalyst who brought diverse stakeholders together emerged as its main power as change&#13;
agent. Representatives from the government, the private sector and the civil society&#13;
reported that the cross-stakeholder consultation process fostered by WBI was beneficial.&#13;
&#13;
6.13    Government officials felt that working together with people from the civil society&#13;
and the private sector had a positive influence on the formulation of strategic documents.&#13;
Civil society representatives were part of the PRSP revision process. Agreements&#13;
between NGOs and the government were signed to provide funds to people living with&#13;
disabilities and to implement programs on literacy. Telecommunications companies&#13;
benefited from better relations with the national regulatory agency. Increased public&#13;
awareness of poverty and health issues helped to create mutual insurance companies.&#13;
&#13;
According to WBI Task Team Leaders&#13;
&#13;
6.14    WBI Task Team Leaders were asked in the survey to describe the results of their&#13;
activities. Answers were given for a third of the activities (12 out of 36), but only eight&#13;
actually described results. They usually echoed what participants said in focus groups.&#13;
&#13;
6.15    What was taught in three activities was used in the PRSP process, notably the&#13;
integration of a Social Protection strategy. Other concrete institutional results mentioned&#13;
include the privatization of a telecommunications company, the launching of a reform&#13;
process in the electricity sector, the acceleration of the process for supplying books to&#13;
schools, better involvement of the civil society (e.g., parents' associations and teachers'&#13;
unions) in the follow-up of book delivery and more interactions between the government&#13;
and the civil society. Two activities reportedly resulted in greater awareness of the issues,&#13;
notably "what is really at stake in educational reforms and their importance with regard&#13;
to the development of a country," and the importance of monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
Finally, one activity resulted in articles written on governance and anti-corruption.18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18In addition, one TTL reported that the activity accelerated progress in health insurance coverage, but not&#13;
in Burkina Faso where the conditions were not favorable enough.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                         35&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
According to operational staff&#13;
&#13;
6.16    None of the operational staff interviewed could report any outcomes that resulted&#13;
from WBI FY02-03 activities yet.&#13;
&#13;
                               WHAT MITIGATED CHANGES?&#13;
&#13;
6.17    Despite the positive changes reported by some participants most alumni felt that&#13;
the WBI intervention was too limited and/or insufficiently adjusted to their needs to bring&#13;
changes beyond themselves. They also said that the large number of players made it&#13;
difficult to attribute changes to WBI.&#13;
&#13;
6.18    In most cases, the extent of WBI's intervention was limited. The number of&#13;
participants from each organization who attended the activities was too small to induce&#13;
change in their work environment. The activities were too short, particularly since there&#13;
was no follow-up. Senior management was not always involved. These combined&#13;
weaknesses did not enable participants to overcome the resistance to change experienced&#13;
in their work environment, notably in the public administration.&#13;
&#13;
6.19    Poor relevance to the country's needs, a content too academic or technical, lack of&#13;
action plans, and no local focal point for follow-up also explained the lack of impact of&#13;
some activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
              7. ARE WBI ACTIVITIES SUSTAINABLE?&#13;
&#13;
7.1      This chapter will address the issue of sustainability from three angles: (a) do WBI&#13;
activities have a follow-up?; (b) should WBI establish a focal point in the country?; and&#13;
(c) would participants pay for WBI activities?&#13;
&#13;
                          DO WBI ACTIVITIES HAVE A FOLLOW-UP?&#13;
&#13;
7.2      Follow-up by TTLs or by participants after an event was rare. Yet participants and&#13;
operational staff feel that a more sustained follow-up is needed. Both stakeholders&#13;
suggested that WBI create a focal point in the country, whether it be a person or a&#13;
partner.&#13;
&#13;
To what extent did WBI follow up with participants after the activity?&#13;
&#13;
7.3      Most participants reported no WBI follow-up. In the participant survey only 15&#13;
percent of the alumni reported that WBI contacted them for issues regarding the&#13;
activity.19 In 64 percent of the activities (27 out of 42) none of the participants answered&#13;
that WBI had contacted them. Participants in the four focus groups highlighted the&#13;
absence of follow-up on the activities they attended.&#13;
&#13;
7.4      The low-level of follow-up reported by participants contrasts with the WBI TTLs'&#13;
descriptions of how they stayed in touch with the Burkinabè participants after the&#13;
activity. In 74 percent of the activities (26 out of 35) the TTL reported a follow-up&#13;
(table 10). Not surprisingly, participant and TTL responses were not correlated.&#13;

19The question asked participants not to report follow-up issues regarding logistics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7.5      The discrepancy between participant and TTL responses may be due to&#13;
inadequate means of communication.20 For example, organizers of nine activities said&#13;
that they e-mailed a newsletter to the Burkinabè participants, but only two of them also&#13;
mailed or faxed the newsletter. As shown by the evaluation data collection and the focus&#13;
groups, participants rarely have easy and inexpensive access to e-mails, even when they&#13;
had listed an email address on the registration forms. Therefore, the TTLs might have&#13;
expected to reach participants, when they actually did not.&#13;
&#13;
7.6      In addition, the poor quality of the mailing information in the CRS and lack of&#13;
updated addresses could also add to the fact that even when non-electronic media were&#13;
used, participants did not receive the follow-up messages for the activity organizers. The&#13;
local consultant in charge of the participant survey data collection used great efforts to&#13;
locate some alumni.&#13;
&#13;
How did WBI follow up on participant requests?&#13;
&#13;
7.7      Only 9 percent of the participants said that they had contacted WBI after the&#13;
activity.21 These thirteen participants reported a mixed level of satisfaction with WBI&#13;
responses, with an average of 3.7 on a scale from 0 "WBI did not respond", to "7 WBI&#13;
responded and was very helpful." TTLs confirmed that not all alumni requests had been&#13;
fulfilled yet in 31 percent of the activities. Participants' and TTLs' responses were&#13;
correlated (r=.56, p=.09, N=10).&#13;
&#13;
7.8      In a free comment question, one TTL volunteered an explanation for the limited&#13;
follow-up with participants. "This looks like an evaluation that stresses not only delivery,&#13;
but also follow-up activities. However, I don't believe that the allocation of budgets at&#13;
WBI was done with this type of activities in mind. Also, incentives were simply not there,&#13;
given our yearly cycle and the need to "produce" as many participants as we could for&#13;
each fiscal year."&#13;
&#13;
7.9      On the other hand, requests for follow-up were the most common type of&#13;
responses given in the participant survey's free comment question. Thirteen alumni&#13;
expressed the need for follow-up. "As in most training offered at national level, the main&#13;
weakness is the lack of follow-up." "To sustain the level, I wish there were a follow-up to&#13;
the training."&#13;
&#13;
7.10     Some WBI activities raised expectations that remained to be fulfilled. "During the&#13;
training, the Association of Publishers in Burkina Faso (ASSEDIF) had obtained from&#13;
Mr. X, WB expert, an agreement on the principle that he would come during the&#13;
International Book Forum of Ouagadougou (FILO) in November, 2003 to train the&#13;
Burkinabè and regional publishers in book bidding. In June 2003, a file was developed&#13;
and given to the Education Project Direction. No follow-up was ever given to it to this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20The discrepancy between TTLs and participant responses may also come from the fact that not all&#13;
participants responded. TTLs could have contacted some participants who happened not to answer the&#13;
survey.&#13;
21The question asked participants not to report follow-up issues regarding logistics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
38&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
day, February 12, 2004." Another participant mentioned that: "the major meeting at&#13;
national level that was suggested never happened."&#13;
&#13;
7.11     Beyond substantive issues, participants also requested that WBI follow-up on&#13;
logistics. Nine participants in three courses mentioned that their certificates had not been&#13;
received at least six months after the end of the activity. "The report, the certificates, and&#13;
the CDs that were promised to participants have not reached us yet."&#13;
&#13;
7.12     Two focus group participants tried to put in practice what they had learned during&#13;
the activities by developing projects or writing articles. Though the documents were sent&#13;
to WBI, they received no feedback.&#13;
&#13;
                SHOULD WBI ESTABLISH A FOCAL POINT IN BURKINA FASO?&#13;
&#13;
7.13     One explanation participants gave during the focus groups for not contacting WBI&#13;
was simply that they felt they did not know whom to contact in the Institute. "There is no&#13;
focal point of WBI in Burkina Faso to respond to the post-training needs of the&#13;
participants." Comments in the participant survey agree with this view: "A complete&#13;
address would help us be in permanent contact with you." Another participant suggested:&#13;
"Establish a follow-up mechanism for the WBI training (create local contact points and&#13;
attend national consultation meetings)."&#13;
&#13;
7.14     These participant suggestions concur with those of four of the six Bank&#13;
Operations staff interviewed. Each stated that WBI should create a focal point in Burkina&#13;
Faso by either appointing WBI staff in the resident mission or by setting up an agreement&#13;
with a local partner organization.22&#13;
&#13;
What other capacity enhancement organizations operate in Burkina Faso?&#13;
&#13;
7.15     Many organizations offer learning activities similar to WBI in Burkina Faso. Most&#13;
are perceived to be as good or better than WBI, presenting wide opportunities for&#13;
partnership. WBI could consider establishing a main local representative partner.&#13;
&#13;
7.16     Sixty-three alumni survey respondents (44 percent) said that they had participated&#13;
in similar learning activities offered by organizations other than WBI in Burkina Faso.&#13;
Fifty-eight respondents compared the usefulness of WBI's activities with these other&#13;
organizations. Of these, 45 percent felt that WBI's activities were more useful, 41 percent&#13;
felt that they were about the same, and 14 percent felt that the WBI activity they attended&#13;
was less useful than that of other organizations. The average rating was 4.67 on a seven-&#13;
point scale shown in figure 14.23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22As part of its decentralization pilot program, in FY04 WBI offered to establish a focal person for WBI&#13;
activities in Burkina Faso. However, the Country Team for Burkina Faso declined the offer because WBI&#13;
was asking that this be a shared position co-financed by the Region and WBI.&#13;
23The rating of WBI activities compared with similar activities from other organizations was correlated&#13;
with their average effectiveness rating of the WBI activity (r=.41, p=.00, N=58). This comparative rating&#13;
was not correlated with their frequency of use or the perceived changed attributed to the WBI activity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                       39&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7.17                      Participants who had attended similar activities offered by other organizations&#13;
could list the names of up to three of them. On average each participant listed 1.5&#13;
organizations. Their responses were spread among 58 organizations. Using an arithmetic&#13;
average, if we consider these organizations as potential partners and eliminate those&#13;
whose perceived usefulness was lower than WBI's, WBI could choose to partner with 32&#13;
organizations who performed as well or better than WBI.&#13;
&#13;
7.18                      During the focus group discussions, participants mentioned seventeen&#13;
organizations that could partner with WBI. Operational staff mentioned ten organizations.&#13;
Altogether, after eliminating overlaps, participants and operational staff mentioned&#13;
having attended similar activities organized by and/or suggested to cooperate with 72&#13;
organizations operating in Burkina Faso listed in annex 16.&#13;
&#13;
                                     WOULD PARTICIPANTS PAY FOR WBI ACTIVITIES?&#13;
&#13;
7.19                      Participants in the focus groups were asked how they felt about being asked by&#13;
WBI if they or their institutions would pay for their participation. Opinions differed&#13;
according to participants' organizations and locations. They recommended that the fees&#13;
vary according to the organizations' financial capacity.&#13;
&#13;
7.20                      Participants from international organizations, embassies, private sector and&#13;
projects financed by donors thought that the principle of paying is good. It could increase&#13;
the motivation of participants and their managers to implement what has been learned&#13;
during the activities. Their institutions could pay for their participation. Some of them&#13;
said they would pay if they are asked to, but only if the activities' contents were concrete&#13;
and adapted to their daily professional needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
40&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7.21    Participants from the public sector and civil society indicated that the financial&#13;
problems their institutions are facing would make it difficult for them to pay for their&#13;
employees' participation, even if their top management were confident in the quality of&#13;
WBI training activities. As for paying themselves, their low salaries make participation&#13;
fees unaffordable.&#13;
&#13;
7.22    In addition, participants suggested that WBI provide a budget to cover the daily&#13;
subsistence and transportation costs of people residing outside of the city of delivery.&#13;
&#13;
7.23    Some participants already paid for their participation through sponsors, notably&#13;
bilateral donors, or through the government when the training was part of a project&#13;
financed by the World Bank. In the open-ended free comments on the survey, one&#13;
participant wrote: "the distance learning activities are very beneficial to my activities.&#13;
They should reach more people. (...) However, the cost is very high and not affordable to&#13;
everyone."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        41&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         8. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
8.1    This chapter aggregates the findings of the previous chapters using all data&#13;
sources. It first describes the performance assessment of the observed activities in terms&#13;
of relevance, effectiveness, use and change induced. Then, it summarizes the main factors&#13;
explaining these performance variables. Finally, it provides recommendations for&#13;
improvements.&#13;
&#13;
                DESCRIPTIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE OBSERVED ACTIVITIES&#13;
&#13;
8.2    Overall Burkinabè participants who attended WBI activities in FY02-03 assessed&#13;
them favorably, notably in the participant survey. In the focus groups, participants' main&#13;
impression of their experience with WBI was also favorable. However, when prompted,&#13;
they provided both examples of areas of strengths and weaknesses. Operational staff&#13;
provided less favorable assessments. All data sources triangulated provide the following&#13;
descriptive assessment of the activities studied:&#13;
&#13;
    · Little Burkina Faso country-focus: As expected in this baseline study, the vast&#13;
       majority of observed activities had a low "country-focus index" for Burkina Faso.&#13;
       This pilot indicator, specially designed for this study, was based on features of&#13;
       activities that WBI Task Team Leaders considered to be country-focused:&#13;
       strongly involved stakeholders in the country and in Operations, had contents&#13;
       customized for the country, included a large number of Burkinabè participants,&#13;
       and were followed by another WBI learning activity.&#13;
&#13;
    · Only partially aligned notably with Operations: Although on paper, 86 percent of&#13;
       the WBI thematic programs were aligned with Burkinabè CAS recommendations,&#13;
       and 64 percent with the World Bank IDA Operations, regional staff felt that the&#13;
       overall alignments were weak. Only 39 percent of WBI TTLs said that their&#13;
       activities supported, or was a part of, a World Bank Operation.&#13;
&#13;
    · Relevant to the country's needs, but less relevant to participant work: Participant&#13;
       ratings of the activities relevance to the countries' need were high (5.97 on a 7-&#13;
       point scale), but in the focus groups a few participants mentioned poor relevance&#13;
       as a weakness. Ratings for the relevance to work were lower, on average 5.22 out&#13;
       of 7.&#13;
&#13;
    · Relatively effective: On average, participants rated effectiveness 5.24 out of 7,&#13;
       but with broad variations across areas: 5.73 for providing participants with&#13;
       knowledge and skills, and only 4.36 for helping them develop contacts,&#13;
       partnerships and build coalitions in the field.&#13;
&#13;
    · Used by participants: On average, participants rated use 5.01 on a scale of 1 (not&#13;
       at all) to 7 (very often) with greater use in implementing new practices in&#13;
       participants' organizations (5.15) than in influencing legislation and regulation&#13;
       (4.34). Main outcomes at personal and professional levels were greater&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
42&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       confidence, increased knowledge and skills and networking. Some institutions&#13;
       improved their methods. Knowledge and tools were used for the development of&#13;
       national strategies.&#13;
&#13;
     · Brought positive changes: with an average of 5.33 on a scale of 1 (strong negative&#13;
       change) to 7 (strong positive change). The field of research experienced the most&#13;
       positive changes while legislation and regulation were least positively rated.&#13;
       Alumni felt that WBI helped improve the interaction between government and&#13;
       civil society.&#13;
&#13;
     · With limited follow-up: only 15 percent of the participants reported any follow-up&#13;
       by WBI. Even fewer alumni (9 percent) contacted WBI after the activity;&#13;
       moreover, their satisfaction with the Institute's responses was mixed.&#13;
     · Mostly not addressing gender issues: WBI TTLs said that in 51 percent of the&#13;
       activities "raising participant awareness of gender issues" was not an objective, in&#13;
       37 percent it was a minor objective and only in 11 percent a major objective. This&#13;
       was significantly correlated with participant perception of whether the activity&#13;
       was relevant to the Millennium Development Goal of promoting gender equality&#13;
       and empowering women (r=.48, p=.01, N=26). Participants ranked this goal&#13;
       among the last in the list of development goals addressed by WBI activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                           ACTIVITY PERFORMANCE FACTORS&#13;
&#13;
8.3    The report examined the factors explaining the activities performance in terms of&#13;
relevance to Burkina Faso's needs, relevance to participants' work, "direct" effectiveness&#13;
(i.e., with direct effect on the participants), "indirect" effectiveness (i.e., where&#13;
participants are expected to induce further changes in involving other people), use of the&#13;
knowledge and skills by participants, and perceived changes induced by the activities.&#13;
Table 11 summarizes these relationships using the results of the quantitative and&#13;
qualitative analysis.&#13;
&#13;
8.4    The intuitive logic according to which relevance increases effectiveness, that&#13;
leads to larger use and in turn greater change was only partially confirmed in this study.&#13;
Not all dimensions of relevance, effectiveness, use and change were associated. While&#13;
these performance variables are important, participant selection, context, language skills,&#13;
and other activity features matter too.&#13;
&#13;
8.5    None of the observed factors could improve every performance dimension&#13;
studied. Occasionally, some factors had opposite effects across performance variables.&#13;
However, the following major factors were identified:&#13;
&#13;
     · Involving clients, local partners and Bank Operations: Being more "country-&#13;
       focused" on Burkina Faso (an index heavily associated with involving local&#13;
       stakeholders and Operations) led to greater indirect effectiveness and certain areas&#13;
       of use, ceteris paribus. Closely working with a Burkinabè partner organization led&#13;
       to more positive changes. Regional staff felt that more frequent communication&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        43&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        with better follow-up between WBI and Operations would improve the relevance&#13;
        of WBI activities to the country's needs.&#13;
&#13;
    · Being relevant: A content neither too technical nor too academic that is relevant&#13;
        to participants' work increased effectiveness and use. Addressing more country&#13;
        development goals boosted effectiveness. "Policy service" (rather than "skill-&#13;
        building") activities designed to help solve some of Burkina Faso's problems&#13;
        were associated with higher relevance to the country's needs.&#13;
&#13;
    · Expanding the activity beyond its delivery: Developing an action plan during the&#13;
        activity to apply the new knowledge once back to work increased the relevance to&#13;
        work, the use of what was learned and the reported changes induced by the&#13;
        activity. Following up, inviting the same participants to subsequent WBI&#13;
        activities, and involving a local partner helped to induce greater change.&#13;
&#13;
    · Selecting a diverse group of participants able to overcome contextual barriers:&#13;
        Seniority was related to higher relevance to work, greater use and change,&#13;
        although more junior participants found the activities more effective. Being in an&#13;
        organization and function related to the area of use and feeling that work and&#13;
        country contexts were supportive notably increased use. Involving participants'&#13;
        senior management, inviting a critical mass of participants from the same&#13;
        organization were mentioned as factors that help to overcome change-averse&#13;
        hierarchical organizations, to increase participants' use of the knowledge and&#13;
        skills they had learned at the activity and to induce more positive changes.&#13;
        Inviting diverse stakeholders, notably having national government representatives&#13;
        work together with participants from the civil society or the private sector led to&#13;
        greater change.&#13;
&#13;
    · Delivering in a language well understood by participants: Participants mastering&#13;
        the activity's technical terminology was associated with higher relevance to work&#13;
        and use, and working daily in the language of the activity helped promote change.&#13;
        Instructors insufficiently fluent in French lowered the effectiveness of some&#13;
        activities.&#13;
&#13;
8.6     In most cases, participant gender made no difference in perception of the&#13;
activity's performance, but women were more likely to find the activity relevant to the&#13;
country and to integrate gender issues into their work. Men were more likely to&#13;
implement new practices learned at the activity in their organizations, under certain&#13;
circumstances. Women perceived their country's development context to be more helpful&#13;
than men did, with no difference in their work context. Interestingly, alumni found the&#13;
activities that TTLs defined as country-focused on Burkina Faso to be more related to&#13;
gender issues. These alumni were also more likely to use what they learned at the activity&#13;
to integrate gender in their work.&#13;

                                   RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
8.7     Overall, the consolidated evidence from this report suggests that WBI should&#13;
strengthen the implementation of its country-focus approach for Burkina Faso. Most&#13;
observed activities had a low country-focus index on Burkina Faso, which, in some&#13;
models, was associated with greater effectiveness and use. Suggestions for improvements&#13;
provided by participants and operational staff support the implementation of this strategy.&#13;
&#13;
8.8     Within this approach, more specific recommendations relate to (a) work processes&#13;
and organization, (b) activity features, (c) participant selection, and (d) incentive and data&#13;
systems of WBI.&#13;
&#13;
8.9     WBI could better serve its Burkinabè clients by implementing or strengthening&#13;
the following work processes or organization:&#13;
&#13;
    · Work with Operations staff more systematically: On the one hand, when&#13;
        consulted at all by WBI staff, Operations staff were often asked for occasional&#13;
        input with limited follow-up even on their contributions. On the other hand, since&#13;
        Burkina Faso was chosen as a focus country, WBI never received an invitation&#13;
        from the Country Team to participate in a meeting or in one of its activities. A&#13;
        more active Country Team would greatly facilitate collaboration. Altogether,&#13;
        closer collaboration between WBI and Regions staff would and help improve the&#13;
        alignment of WBI programs with the Country Assistance Strategy and with&#13;
        Operations.&#13;
&#13;
    · Involve local stakeholders: Working with the client country government and other&#13;
        local organizations was strongly embedded into the country-focus index, which&#13;
        boosted certain areas of effectiveness and use under specific conditions. Largely&#13;
        involving a local partner led to greater changes.&#13;
&#13;
    · Establish a focal point for WBI in the country in the form of a person or a partner:&#13;
        This would help improve the alignment with Burkina Faso's needs and enable&#13;
        easier follow-up by participants and operational staff.&#13;
&#13;
    · Supplement the use of electronic media with paper communication and materials:&#13;
        Although many alumni listed e-mail addresses, actual access to the Internet--and&#13;
        computers--was much more limited than it seemed. In addition, connections are&#13;
        slow and expensive in Burkina Faso. The use of materials on CD ROMs or&#13;
        follow-up communications is limited because of uneasy and costly access to&#13;
        electronic media.&#13;
&#13;
8.10    WBI activities could improve their impact and better address Burkinabè's needs&#13;
by using or strengthening the following features:&#13;
&#13;
    · Focus on relevance and adapt the message to the audience: Relevance to work&#13;
        boosted perceived effectiveness and use of the knowledge and skills acquired. The&#13;
        lack of relevance to the country's context was mentioned as a hindrance to use&#13;
        and change.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
46&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    · Have participants develop action plans during the activity: Action plans that&#13;
      enable participants to apply what they learned on the job were associated with&#13;
      greater relevance to work, more frequent use of the knowledge and skills acquired&#13;
      and more positive changes induced.&#13;
&#13;
    · Follow up after the activity: Although participants and operational staff alike&#13;
      found following up to be an essential part of an activity, actual follow-up was&#13;
      minimal. Repeated attendance in WBI activities led to more positive change.&#13;
&#13;
    · Address gender more often and more effectively: While gender is a crosscutting&#13;
      theme in WBI activities and Burkina Faso a gender-focus country as of FY05, the&#13;
      extent to which gender was addressed in the observed WBI activities was limited.&#13;
      The effectiveness in raising participant awareness and understanding of gender&#13;
      issues important to the activity was among the lowest-rated areas of effectiveness.&#13;
      Besides, activities that officially aimed to raise participant awareness of gender&#13;
      issues were not more likely to achieve this objective than other activities. Neither&#13;
      were their participants more likely to use what they had learned at the activity to&#13;
      integrate gender in their work.&#13;
&#13;
    · Deliver the activity in a language clear to participants using instructors fluent in&#13;
      French: Almost all observed activities were in French, so language was generally&#13;
      not a barrier. Yet, using a technical language already mastered by the audience&#13;
      increased relevance and use, and the participants who worked regularly in the&#13;
      language of the activity reported more positive change. Also, language fluency by&#13;
      the instructors was occasionally an issue.&#13;
&#13;
8.11  Selecting the right group of participants increases the activity's performance:&#13;
&#13;
    · Invite participants in senior positions: Alumni in higher-level positions were more&#13;
      likely to find the activity relevant to their work, use it and report greater changes.&#13;
&#13;
    · Invite a critical mass of participants from the same organization and involve their&#13;
      senior managers: This helped alumni to overcome the reluctance to change in&#13;
      some hierarchical organizations and to apply what they had learned at the activity.&#13;
&#13;
    · Increase the participation of representatives from the civil society and the private&#13;
      sector alongside government officials: WBI's ability to make various branches of&#13;
      society work together was the underlying commonality among the examples of&#13;
      change provided by alumni. Most participants, however, were from central&#13;
      government agencies.&#13;
&#13;
    · Reach out to participants outside the capital city: Each PRSP pillar includes&#13;
      reaching out to local/rural areas. Local public administration officials are in&#13;
      charge of the implementation of national policies at the local level. Yet, almost all&#13;
      participants reached by WBI lived in the capital area.&#13;
&#13;
    · Invite participants in a position to use the activity: Participants used the&#13;
      knowledge and skills acquired at the activity more in their area of work. Alumni&#13;
      closer to the activity's effects reported more positive changes, e.g., government&#13;
      officials and policymakers saw more changes in policymaking than other alumni.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          47&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8.12  WBI should use performance indicators and improve its data systems to match the&#13;
new country-focus strategy.&#13;
&#13;
    · Use indicators that take into account all of WBI's interventions, beyond activity&#13;
      delivery, and provide an incentive for sustained actions: The current performance&#13;
      indicators are perceived as incentives to "produce" participant/days more than&#13;
      country-focused capacity enhancement. Consequently, efforts towards following&#13;
      up with alumni are limited.&#13;
&#13;
    · Use indicators that monitor WBI's collaboration with Operations: to give an&#13;
      incentive for aligning WBI programs with Operations.&#13;
&#13;
    · Improve the quality of the Client Registration Systems data: To follow up with&#13;
      participants, having good contact information is required. However, the CRS&#13;
      participant data is often incomplete, and misspelled. Having participant&#13;
      information entered by people who know the language and region of the activity&#13;
      would help.&#13;

              ANNEX 2: AGREEMENT ON THE DATA COLLECTION CONDITIONS&#13;
&#13;
  Agreement between local data collector and WBIEG on data collection conditions&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the specifications of the contract issued by the Human Resources Department of the&#13;
World Bank Group, I, undersigned ___________________________ , guarantee that I will&#13;
perform the tasks described in my Terms of References in obeying the following rules:&#13;
&#13;
    1. I will respectfully encourage the former WBI participants to complete the evaluation&#13;
         survey, without influencing what they choose to respond.                  (I may provide&#13;
         information/clarification about the survey, but will not lead them to respond in any&#13;
         particular way. The purpose of the survey is to obtain honest feedback on what is asked.)&#13;
&#13;
    2. I will not complete any survey or any part of a survey in lieu of a participant. (I may,&#13;
         notably if I conduct a survey by phone, faithfully record the answers that a participant&#13;
         gives me, but I will neither change any of the participant responses nor add answers of&#13;
         my own to any survey.) The only exception is that I may write the date of completion on&#13;
         the survey myself, if the participant did not write it down.&#13;
&#13;
    3. I will not knowingly record in the database the responses of any survey that was&#13;
         completed--in part or in full--by someone other than the participant expected to answer&#13;
         the particular survey.&#13;
&#13;
    4. I will honor the confidentiality of individual participant responses to the survey and to the&#13;
         focus group. I will not disclose or discuss the responses of individual participants with&#13;
         anyone other than the team of World Bank staff/consultants who are working on the&#13;
         Country-Focused Retrospective Evaluation for Burkina Faso.&#13;
&#13;
    5. I understand that credibility is a critical part of any evaluation and that the circumstances&#13;
         under which the current evaluation is to be conducted require the establishment of&#13;
         measures guaranteeing its credibility. Therefore, I understand and agree with the fact that&#13;
         WBIEG will randomly contact respondents to verify that the data collection was&#13;
         conducted under the conditions mentioned in the four points above. WBIEG checking&#13;
         may be done by letter, e-mail, phone, fax or in person during a mission to Burkina Faso.&#13;
&#13;
I understand that if a clear violation of the above conditions was uncovered, I would not be paid&#13;
for the related part of the evaluation, and I would loose my chances to work on other contracts&#13;
with the World Bank Group, notably the expected follow-up to the current evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
If I felt unclear about the conditions stated above, I could--before, upon or after signing--seek&#13;
clarifications from Ms. Violaine Le Rouzic, task team leader for the current country-focused&#13;
retrospective evaluation for Burkina Faso.&#13;
&#13;
                                         Read and approved,&#13;

Department of the World Bank Group, and faxed back to XXXXXX, at XXXXXXX.)&#13;

&#13;
     · Beneficial (SP, April)&#13;
     · Wonderful (PG)&#13;
     · Satisfying (April)&#13;
&#13;
     · Inspires hope in the possibility of change/openness of vision and thinking (SP)&#13;
     · Non-satisfying (April)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q2. How have you been chosen to participate in the activities?&#13;
&#13;
Most had been chosen individually by the directors of organizations and associations,&#13;
based on professional expertise and availability.&#13;
&#13;
In one case, seventeen former participants were chosen as a group by the service director.&#13;
&#13;
Three participants were encouraged to participate by former WBI participants and/or&#13;
facilitators who described WBI learning activities as high level, rich in content, and with&#13;
high training professional standards and a label of quality and international recognition.&#13;
&#13;
Q3. What aspects of the training have been the most beneficial to you and how did&#13;
you use them?&#13;
&#13;
All but two participants could provide examples of how the activities were beneficial to&#13;
them. The most beneficial aspects were tools that helped to develop national policies and&#13;
methods to get people involved in policy development. Benefits were found at personal,&#13;
professional, institutional, and country levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         83&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                    A. At Personal Level:&#13;
&#13;
Participants expressed positive views about the effectiveness of the program in terms of&#13;
their personal development in gaining self-confidence, exposure to other countries'&#13;
experience, better understanding of the issues, and improved communication.&#13;
&#13;
    Self-confidence:&#13;
    · The entire group of participants said that the activities had increased their self-&#13;
        confidence. "Knowledge is the root of self-confidence." (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · The civil society organizations leaders are now more self-confident in negotiating&#13;
        with the government to defend their rights. (SP)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Exposure to other countries' experience:&#13;
    · Participants appreciated the open-mind atmosphere stemming from the exposure&#13;
        to diverse cultures and experiences. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · The videoconferences were very informative on other countries' experiences.&#13;
        (PG)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Better understanding:&#13;
    · Better understanding of the need to involve all stakeholders in elaborating&#13;
        regional poverty reduction strategies. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · Better understanding the poverty dynamic was used to develop a strategic plan.&#13;
        (PG)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Improved communication:&#13;
    · One participant reported that the Reproductive Health training session helped her&#13;
        greatly in her private life. She learned how to communicate with her family&#13;
        members as well as with her Association members. (April)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  B. At Professional Level:&#13;
&#13;
Better skills/methods and networking opportunities that grew out of the activity were&#13;
most often reported.&#13;
&#13;
    Skills and methods:&#13;
    · Methods of calculating and assessing inter-connection cost improved financial&#13;
        management accounting: operational cost account, fixed cost, product&#13;
        development cost, administrative cost. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · New skills in planning and budgeting their activities were given by most of the&#13;
        participants as elements acquired from WBI training sessions. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · To journalists, the training provided professional methods and tools for tactful&#13;
        investigations and for writing articles on business subjects. A journalist who was&#13;
        a former participant received the "Prix Galian" for the best interview. (April)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
84&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    Networking opportunities:&#13;
    · Post-training collaborations were made after having developed networks during&#13;
        training. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · One participant still has strong relationships and collaborations with publishers of&#13;
        other countries he met during the training session. Together they wrote a proposal&#13;
        to submit to donors for financing. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · During the WBI activity one participant met the Manager of STEP/BIT&#13;
        (Strategies and Techniques against Social Exclusion and Poverty/International&#13;
        Labour Organization). Later, she visited the institution and was offered a&#13;
        scholarship for microfinance training. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · Another participant was invited to participate in activities organized by former&#13;
        participants whom she met during the WBI training session. (April)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 C. At Institutional Level:&#13;
&#13;
Methods discussed in the WBI activities were used for institutional capacity enhancement&#13;
in the fields of regulation, education and labor.&#13;
&#13;
    Use of methods for institutional capacity enhancement:&#13;
    · The training provided the top management of the High Authority of&#13;
        Telecommunications Regulation with good methods to build a fair atmosphere of&#13;
        competition between several telecommunications companies. Negotiation tools to&#13;
        create an environment of mutual confidence between the High Authority of&#13;
        Telecommunications Regulations and the companies were also acquired. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · The methodology (consisting of knowing the development process and the&#13;
        different mechanisms depending on the area: government, private sector and civil&#13;
        society) learned at the activity is used in management and teaching methods at the&#13;
        University. It helps to establish good rules of partnership between state and non-&#13;
        state actors. (SP).&#13;
&#13;
    · The National Primary School Teachers Organization (SNEAB) acquired methods&#13;
        to preserve schoolbooks in a good condition. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · The STEP/BIT now better adapts the project strategy to the needs of poor people&#13;
        by organizing needs assessment workshops and writing action plans with the&#13;
        relevant stakeholders, instead of relying on strategies developed purely from&#13;
        within the organization. (SP)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 D. At the Country Level:&#13;
&#13;
Knowledge and tools gained at the WBI activities were used in the PRSP process and the&#13;
elaboration of sectoral national strategies and plans, notably in the fields of social&#13;
protection, health, education and water resource management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                       85&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  Use in the PRSP process:&#13;
  · Information gathered from the training has been used to develop protocols for&#13;
    example on indicators during the PRSP revision process. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
  · Integration of some elements drawn from the study in the revised PRSP&#13;
    document, notably identifying the situations faced by different groups of poor&#13;
    people and offering different mechanisms according to the type of poverty faced.&#13;
    (SP)&#13;
&#13;
  · WBI made civil society organizations' leaders more conscious of their role and&#13;
    importance in helping the country to reduce poverty. The activities showed them&#13;
    clearly that as partners, the government has the obligation to involve them in the&#13;
    poverty reduction strategy revision process and in the implementation of the&#13;
    revised strategy. As participation begins with information, the civil society&#13;
    organizations' leaders asked the government to organize a feedback forum to&#13;
    inform their members on the PRSP revision process. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
  Use in elaboration of sectoral national strategies/plans:&#13;
  · Knowledge gained from the training is implemented in the development of the&#13;
    national social protection strategy. This knowledge has been of great help to the&#13;
    Ministry of Social Action and National Solidarity staff in a study on current&#13;
    mechanisms of management, their limits and social risks. (SP)&#13;
&#13;
  · The training has been useful in the elaboration of the national health policy and&#13;
    the national health plan, notably in linking health objectives to poverty reduction&#13;
    at two levels: (1) central, and (2) deconcentrated/decentralized. Former policy&#13;
    documents focused on central level: equipments, budget, staff were concentrated&#13;
    in the central level (national and regional hospitals). The current documents (the&#13;
    national health policy and national health plan) address the central level and the&#13;
    deconcentrated and decentralized levels. For example, a great part of the funds for&#13;
    health training schools were decentralized to the district level. In addition, service&#13;
    delivery access is addressed both on the physical and financial sides. As far as&#13;
    AIDS is concerned, there is now a focus on prevention through sensitization in&#13;
    decentralized and rural levels where people cannot pay for ARV drugs, while the&#13;
    central level policy relied on a combination of ARV drugs and preventive&#13;
    measures. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
  · The methodology learned during the activity is used in the Ten Year National&#13;
    Basic Education Program (PDDEB), notably by considering strategies to address&#13;
    all the risks girls can face on the road to school, in the school yard, in order to&#13;
    reduce the gap between girls' and boys' education rate, or by providing food at&#13;
    school to maintain children at school and enable them to learn better while they&#13;
    do not suffer from hunger. (SP)&#13;
&#13;
  · The training has been of great help in the national policy of water resource&#13;
    management assessment, notably with the introduction of the concept of&#13;
    sustainability. Linking water management with agriculture offered the opportunity&#13;
    to develop an action plan for an integrated management of water resources. (SP)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
86&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Q4. Are you aware of changes brought by the WBI learning activities on your&#13;
institution or the country?&#13;
&#13;
Some WBI activities helped to promote relations among stakeholders that resulted in&#13;
agreements between the government and the civil society, an enabling environment for&#13;
private sector development in the telecommunications regulation and health insurance&#13;
fields, and a better coordination and involvement of the civil society. WBI's role as a&#13;
catalyst led to the integration of social protection in poverty reduction strategies.&#13;
&#13;
    Agreements between the government and the civil society:&#13;
    · As a result of the training on social protection, a protocol between the government&#13;
        and the Association of Handicapped Persons was established. The government&#13;
        granted a national fund for persons living with disabilities to the Association. (SP)&#13;
&#13;
    · A contract has been signed between the government and the civil society to&#13;
        implement programs on literacy. WBI helped in this contract by showing clearly&#13;
        through the training sessions that the government can no longer define and&#13;
        implement strategies alone. In the context of administrative reform and&#13;
        decentralization, the government should contract with civil society and the private&#13;
        sector in areas where they proved to be effective. This is the case for literacy,&#13;
        where the civil society is very dynamic and has good results. WBI informed civil&#13;
        society organizations' members that they have the right to be involved in the&#13;
        struggle against poverty as important stakeholders. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
    Fostering an environment enabling private sector development:&#13;
    · An atmosphere of mutual confidence among telecommunications companies and&#13;
        between them and the national regulatory authority, whose decisions are accepted&#13;
        by all companies, was the result of WBI activities. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · WBI helped increase public awareness of poverty and health issues that helped to&#13;
        create mutual insurance companies. The training provided information on the&#13;
        direct link between poor health and poverty. It also showed that the existing&#13;
        insurance companies do not take into account the poor with very low and irregular&#13;
        incomes. It was clear after the training that micro-insurance was the adapted&#13;
        response for the insurance of the poor. (April)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Positive effects for the civil society:&#13;
    · WBI activities supported and stimulated a participatory approach--including the&#13;
        civil society--for the revision of the PRSP. The government has considered the&#13;
        civil society representatives as full partners during the PRSP revision process and&#13;
        its implementation. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
    · After the training, participants reorganized the structure of the civil society&#13;
        networks in national and provincial units. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
    · The training gave a representative of the civil society the courage to talk about&#13;
        some issues. The public administration took them into account. The role of the&#13;
        civil society in the alphabetization strategies received more consideration. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          87&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   Participatory approaches enabled better strategies:&#13;
    · The fact that government officials worked together with people from the civil&#13;
       society and the private sector had a positive influence on the formulation of&#13;
       strategic documents. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
   Social protection is included in poverty reduction strategies with a broader conception:&#13;
    · The first version of the first document adopted in 2000 did not include explicitly&#13;
       social protection mechanisms within the strategies of poverty reduction. A WBI&#13;
       activity provided a good basis for the development of the national policy on social&#13;
       protection (still ongoing). The seminar contributed to the growing acceptability of&#13;
       social protection in policymaking. WBI played a catalyst role for the integration&#13;
       of new concepts in the poverty reduction strategies and highlighted the need to&#13;
       include social protection within those strategies. (SP)&#13;
&#13;
    · WBI helped people expand their understanding of social protection from actions&#13;
       to protect women, orphans and disabled people to other vulnerable groups. (SP)&#13;
&#13;
Yet, most participants felt that the WBI intervention was too limited and/or insufficiently&#13;
adjusted to their needs to bring changes beyond themselves. They also felt that the large&#13;
number of players made it difficult to attribute changes to WBI.&#13;
&#13;
   The extent of WBI's intervention was limited: lack of critical mass of participants per&#13;
   organization, short length of the activities, lack of involvement of decision-makers:&#13;
    · In each organization, generally only one or two people have participated in the&#13;
       activity. This number is not sufficient enough to introduce changes. For WBI&#13;
       activities to induce more change, more participants (including senior management&#13;
       and decision-makers) need to be invited. Having a critical mass of participants&#13;
       could help raise awareness that changes are needed particularly in organizations&#13;
       with complex structures. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · Almost all participants attended only one learning activity that lasted a few days.&#13;
       This short length is not sufficient enough to bring about change. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · Participants from private and public newspapers indicated that a change could&#13;
       have been possible if the senior managers of the Ministry of Information and&#13;
       many media organizations, e.g., television, radio, and newspapers journalists had&#13;
       attended the activity. (April)&#13;
&#13;
   Activity content needs to be better adjusted to the context and practical needs:&#13;
    · At a regional level, it is hard to introduce changes without adapting the training&#13;
       content to the regional level, which is in charge of implementation. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · The training focused on theories rather than how to solve concrete problems.&#13;
       (April)&#13;
&#13;
   Attribution issue:&#13;
    · Many other public and private organizations deliver capacity enhancement&#13;
       activities for people in the public administration, private sector or civil society.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Q5. What obstacles, if any, did you encounter in trying to implement what you&#13;
learned in WBI activities?&#13;
&#13;
Obstacles related to (A) the country's poor electronic communication system, (B) work&#13;
and country's context, and (C) missing features in WBI activities.&#13;
&#13;
                                A. Electronic Communication&#13;
&#13;
Materials and communications in electronic forms are either hard to use or unused&#13;
because of the poor level of computerization, particularly in the public sector and the&#13;
civil society.&#13;
     · Most participants do not have easy access to information and communication&#13;
        technologies. They lack the equipment and/or the computer skills. The Internet is&#13;
        expensive and the connections are slow. (April, PG, SP)&#13;
&#13;
     · A participant in charge of the Regional Director of the Ministry of Economy and&#13;
        Development of Mouhoun does not have a computer in the whole department. He&#13;
        created an electronic address but has to pay to send and receive e-mails. (April)&#13;
&#13;
     · A participant was eager to use the CD-ROM sent by the Health and Population&#13;
        team, but did not have access to a computer neither at work nor at home. (April)&#13;
&#13;
     · When computers are available in public services, they are generally in the office&#13;
        of the General Director who would not know how to use it. Younger participants&#13;
        who could use computers do not have access to them. (April)&#13;
&#13;
     · Journalists lack financial and material resources to enable them to conduct more&#13;
        in-depth investigations. (April)&#13;
&#13;
     · WBI needs to realize that when they organize online learning, the Internet&#13;
        connection cost is very high and the flow of information very slow. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          B. Context&#13;
&#13;
The lack of a critical mass of participants from an organization in WBI activities and the&#13;
lack of involvement of senior management made it impossible to overcome work&#13;
environment hindrances such as general reluctance to change and poor management. In&#13;
some cases, the country's context, notably political pressures and fear of reprisal were&#13;
mentioned as barriers.&#13;
&#13;
    Work context:&#13;
     · The prevailing management culture is based on high hierarchy. If a participant is&#13;
        at the bottom of the hierarchy, chances of introducing changes are limited. If the&#13;
        impact of WBI on telecommunications is so noticeable, it is because the senior&#13;
        manager has himself attended the activities and appreciated them positively. He&#13;
        has sent all his staff to WBI training on regulation and has even organized training&#13;
        sessions for all the telecommunications companies. This was made possible&#13;
        thanks to a good dialogue atmosphere. There is a continuous relationship with&#13;
        WBI and training requests every year. (April)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         89&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    · Professional environment impeded the implementation of new knowledge. The&#13;
       number of participants in each organization is too small compared to the majority&#13;
       of their colleagues who have not attended training, are unaware of the possibilities&#13;
       of change, and don't know the new approaches for handling development issues.&#13;
       (PG)&#13;
&#13;
    · The local public administration officials are scattered and not sufficiently&#13;
       represented in the activities even though they are the ones in charge of the&#13;
       implementation of national policies at the local level. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
    · Some high public officials do not seem to understand the importance of training&#13;
       in better service delivery. Consequently, alumni are not given opportunity in their&#13;
       daily work to implement the new approaches or use the new tools. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
    · Decision-makers in the civil service often lack vision. (April)&#13;
    · It is not easy to introduce new approaches and concepts in the civil service. (SP)&#13;
&#13;
    · Professional promotions are not related to performance. First, the management&#13;
       system is not based on the achievement of clearly defined objectives. Second,&#13;
       failure to achieve objectives (when there are some) is not a source of negative&#13;
       assessment. Consequently, there is lack of accountability. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · Civil servants are not assessed on the basis of their results. (SP)&#13;
    · Some public and civil society organizations poorly manage their human&#13;
       resources. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Country context:&#13;
    · For journalists, access to information is the main problem. People sometimes&#13;
       refuse to be interviewed on delicate subjects for fear of reprisals. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · Civil society organizations and the general public lack confidence in the public&#13;
       administration. This makes them wary of participatory methods. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · Some alumni felt political pressure when trying to introduce changes, such as&#13;
       transparency and equity, in public administration. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · Some experienced pressure from telecommunications companies. (April)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                          C. Missing Features in WBI Activities&#13;
&#13;
Some aspects of the activities tended to be too academic, technical or not adapted to the&#13;
context of the country making implementation difficult. The lack of action plans and of a&#13;
local focal point for WBI added to the difficulty.&#13;
&#13;
   Not adjusted enough to Burkina Faso's needs and context:&#13;
    · All participants agreed that the content needed to be tailored to the country's,&#13;
       organizations' and participants' needs. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · Some elements of training in every sector, notably the case studies, did not fit the&#13;
       context nor capacity enhancement needs of Burkina Faso. (April, PG, SP)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
90&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    · Preparatory meetings in Mauritania did not take sufficiently into account the&#13;
       specific needs of Burkina Faso:&#13;
&#13;
                o Issues in policies formulation because of the high turn over of public&#13;
                   officials and weak local capacities.&#13;
                o There is not yet a culture of follow-up performance monitoring in the&#13;
                   public administration.&#13;
                o The need to build a follow-up and evaluation mechanism at all levels&#13;
                   (central and regional).&#13;
                o The country's decentralization process. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
    Too academic, technical, busy:&#13;
    · Some training activities were too academic. Consequently, participants&#13;
       experienced difficulties in trying to implement the concepts acquired. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · Some activities were too technical and not easy to implement and/or addressed&#13;
       too many themes at once. (SP)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Lack of action plan:&#13;
    · The lack of action plans by the end of the activities did not help participants to&#13;
       systematically implement what they had learned during the sessions. (April, PG)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    No local focal point:&#13;
    · There is no focal point for WBI in Burkina Faso to respond to the post-training&#13;
       needs of participants. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q6. After the activity, did WBI contact you for follow-up issues regarding the&#13;
activity?&#13;
&#13;
Participants stressed that WBI did not follow up with them after the activities. (April, SP,&#13;
PG)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q7. Did you contact WBI for follow-up issues or questions on the content of the&#13;
activity?&#13;
&#13;
Most participants did not try to contact WBI after the activities. The few people who did&#13;
contact WBI received no response.&#13;
&#13;
    · Most participants acknowledged that they did not try to contact WBI. They did&#13;
       not know whom to contact in the Institute. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · Two participants tried to put into practice what they had learned during the&#13;
       activities by elaborating projects or writing articles. The documents were sent to&#13;
       WBI, but they didn't get any feedback. (April)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         91&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Q8. Is gender efficiently taken into account by WBI activities?&#13;
&#13;
In most activities gender was not taken into account. Exceptions were mentioned for&#13;
activities on Reproductive Health and Poverty Reduction Strategies.            Women are&#13;
generally under-represented in the activities.&#13;
&#13;
     · Participants indicated that gender was not sufficiently taken into account in WBI&#13;
        activities. (April)&#13;
&#13;
     · Only the training on Reproductive Health and on Poverty Reduction Strategies&#13;
        had a gender analysis content. (April)&#13;
&#13;
     · Only few women and youth organizations participated in the activities. (April)&#13;
     · Non-governmental representatives and women were under-represented in the&#13;
        activities. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q9. What can be improved in WBI activities?&#13;
&#13;
Suggestions related to (A) getting better connected with the country (by integrating the&#13;
activities in the country's capacity enhancement plans, taking into account the&#13;
decentralization process, establishing a WBI representative in the country, following up,&#13;
and using fluent French-speaking presenters), and (B) improving activity organization&#13;
(i.e., by conducting better participant selection, and allocating time to treat topics in&#13;
greater depth.)&#13;
&#13;
                           A. Be More Connected to the Country&#13;
&#13;
Participants suggested that WBI activities be integrated with the general capacity&#13;
enhancement plans of the country.&#13;
     · WBI should include its activities in a general capacity enhancement plan&#13;
        elaborated by the country with a methodological support to institutions. (April)&#13;
&#13;
     · Instead of occasional training sessions, it is necessary to include WBI in a general&#13;
        capacity enhancement plan elaborated by the country. (SP)&#13;
&#13;
     · Inscribe the training sessions in a global capacity building plan to be more&#13;
        relevant to the country's needs. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
     · Find a strategy to get country decision-makers involved in training on policy&#13;
        formulation. (April)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Activities should take into account the decentralization process, have more&#13;
representatives from the local levels and be organized at central and regional levels.&#13;
     · Participants stressed the need of having training sessions in the country at two&#13;
         levels: central and regional. This would lower the costs since using local training&#13;
         institutions and independent instructors is less expensive. One result would be&#13;
         that case studies and the language would be adapted to the context of the country.&#13;
         Another result would be that participants could be targeted at central and local&#13;
         levels. (April)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
92&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    · The training did not sufficiently consider the decentralization process and actors.&#13;
        (PG)&#13;
&#13;
    · WBI does not target enough mayors, local representatives, and town counselors.&#13;
        (SP)&#13;
&#13;
    · WBI should create a pool of local trainers who can work together with the WBI&#13;
        international experts. (SP)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Participants stressed the need to have a representative of WBI in Burkina Faso.&#13;
    · All participants underlined that it is important to have a representative of WBI in&#13;
        Burkina Faso. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · The fact that WBI doesn't have a local representative in the Ouagadougou WB&#13;
        Office impedes post-training communication and follow-up. It is necessary for&#13;
        WBI to have a representative in Burkina Faso. (SP)&#13;
&#13;
    · The fact that WBI doesn't have a local representative hampers the possibility for&#13;
        post-training follow-ups. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Participants consistently emphasized the lack of follow-up. Some suggested that&#13;
networks of former participants be established.&#13;
    · There is a lack of follow-up and support to help participants apply the new skills&#13;
        acquired during the training. WBI needs to organize a systematic and immediate&#13;
        follow-up after each activity. (April, PG, SP)&#13;
&#13;
    · The documentation promised during the training should be sent to the&#13;
        participants. This has not always been the case. (PG, SP)&#13;
&#13;
    · WBI should establish networks of former participants. If such a framework was&#13;
        created, participants could meet periodically to share "good experiences of&#13;
        training implementation" as well as difficulties to try to find solutions together.&#13;
        (April)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Presenters should be fluent in French. The language skills of WBI program facilitators&#13;
were not always sufficient.&#13;
    · WBI should use French-speaking presenters. With non-French-speaking&#13;
        instructors participants met the following problems: translations from English to&#13;
        French was often inadequate, and the accent created difficulties of comprehension&#13;
        for participants. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · Ensure that all instructors in all activities speak French fluently. Some facilitators&#13;
        had difficulties in expressing themselves clearly in French. There were&#13;
        communication problems with the English-speaking facilitators. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                          B. Improve the Activities' Organization&#13;
&#13;
Alumni recommended that WBI increase the advertising time and invite participants with&#13;
the relevant background. A quota for female participation was also suggested.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         93&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    · Information and documents on the content of the training and participant profile&#13;
       should be sent to participants at least two months in advance to institutions so that&#13;
       the candidates can have time to integrate the training in their agenda. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · The advertising period for the activities is often insufficient to pool enough&#13;
       participants. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
    · Define the participants' profile according to the training themes. Some&#13;
       participants did not have the background required to understand the content of the&#13;
       sessions. (SP)&#13;
&#13;
    · If possible define a participant profile regarding the training theme: choose the&#13;
       participants on the basis of their resumes. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
    · Adopt a system of quota to increase female participation if they have equal&#13;
       qualification. (April)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Participants suggested a better time allocation to enable more in-depth discussions.&#13;
    · A better allocation of the time is necessary for the courses, seminars, and&#13;
       conferences in order to avoid a superficial treatment of the subjects. Avoid&#13;
       rushing presentations. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
    · The short duration of the training sessions was sometimes inadequate to enable&#13;
       discussions and interaction among participants. (SP)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q10. What do you think of the idea of WBI asking you or your institution to pay for&#13;
the training sessions' cost?&#13;
&#13;
Participants' opinions differ according to their organizations and locations. Fee should&#13;
vary according to the organizations' financial capacity. Some paid through donors or&#13;
through the government when training was part of a project financed by the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Participants voiced three different viewpoints depending on their institution and location:&#13;
    · Participants from international organizations, embassies, private sector and&#13;
       projects financed by donors think the principle of paying is good. It could increase&#13;
       the motivation of participants and their managers to implement what has been&#13;
       learned during the activities. Their institutions could pay for their participation.&#13;
       Some of them said they would pay if they were asked to, but only if the activities'&#13;
       contents were concrete and adapted to their daily professional needs. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · Participants from public sector and civil society indicated that the financial&#13;
       problems their institutions are facing would make it difficult for them to pay for&#13;
       their employees' participation, even if the top management were confident in the&#13;
       quality of WBI training activities. As for individual contributions, their low&#13;
       salaries don't allow them to contribute to training costs. (April)&#13;
&#13;
    · For participants residing outside of Ouagadougou, WBI should provide a budget&#13;
       to cover their daily subsistence and transportation costs. (April)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
94&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
If possible, WBI should determine the amount of the contributions according to the&#13;
financial capacity of the participants' organizations, and notably take into consideration&#13;
the very limited resources of the civil society. (PG)&#13;
&#13;
Some participants already paid for their participation through sponsors, notably bilateral&#13;
donors, or through the government when the training is part of a project financed by the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                       95&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
             ANNEX 8: INTERVIEWS WITH WORLD BANK OPERATIONS STAFF&#13;
&#13;
 Synthesis of responses to interviews with six World Bank Operations staff working&#13;
                                on IDA projects in Burkina Faso&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q1. Overall, to what degree do you think WBI "activities" in FY02-03 have been&#13;
aligned with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Burkina Faso? (Please&#13;
consider the term "activities," beyond just the learning offerings, but also all&#13;
services and products provided by WBI, materials, web sites, advisory services, etc.)&#13;
If you were to rate the degree of alignment on a scale of 1 to 7, (where 1 is "no&#13;
alignment" and 7 is "complete alignment"), how would you rate it?&#13;
&#13;
The average alignment rating was 4.0. (Three people answered 4, two people answered 3,&#13;
and one person answered 6).&#13;
&#13;
Q2. In what way would you say that WBI is aligned with the CAS? (e.g., sector,&#13;
approach)&#13;
&#13;
Four interviewees mentioned some signs of alignment in the Environment sector (2),&#13;
Poverty and Growth (1), a few activities to support the process of PRSP (1), and Capacity&#13;
enhancement (1).25&#13;
&#13;
WBI is aligned in: (a) Natural resources management, (b) Capacity enhancement, (c)&#13;
Environment.&#13;
&#13;
In a certain way WBI is somewhat aligned on agricultural programs: some training&#13;
sessions' themes are related to agriculture, but do not complement agricultural projects.&#13;
&#13;
A few activities support the process of poverty reduction strategy paper revision: training&#13;
of Public administration staff and Civil Society organizations leaders&#13;
&#13;
Aligned to some extent, for example, tools have been developed to enhance the capacities&#13;
of the Ministry of Economy and Development to analyze poverty: Poverty Analysis&#13;
Macro-Economic Simulator (PAMS). Other tools have been also developed to analyze&#13;
the impact of government policies on poverty growth or reduction.&#13;
&#13;
However, half of the interviewees said that they did not have enough information about&#13;
WBI programs (3/6). Notably, they don't know what happened after they contributed to&#13;
WBI activities or strategic meetings (2)&#13;
&#13;
I don't have enough information on WBI activities to answer this question. I only&#13;
attended a meeting in June 2003 when the draft document was presented. I don't know&#13;
the content of the document neither what has been done with it after this date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
25The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of interviewees who expressed the idea. Occasionally,&#13;
more comments are listed below the summary than the number appearing in parenthesis, because an&#13;
interviewee expressed several ideas under this concept.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
In the health sector, a training activity on reproductive health was organized last year&#13;
but since this date, I have no information for example concerning the involvement of the&#13;
Ministry of Health in this session.&#13;
&#13;
I don't have enough information.&#13;
&#13;
Three interviewees highlighted the weakness of the alignment.&#13;
&#13;
[As of] early March 2004 the final Country Program Brief has not yet been released. So,&#13;
at the level of Ouagadougou, we can hardly speak of a country specific approach. The&#13;
planning for activities 2004, which we received at the end of January 2004, does not&#13;
really reflect the issues discussed in the Draft Country Program Brief.&#13;
&#13;
There is no strategy to build coherence between WBI activities and the CAS. WBI really&#13;
needs to have a representative in Burkina Faso to ensure that all stakeholders are&#13;
informed of the activities.&#13;
&#13;
There is a lot to do to involve the Country Team in WBI activities.&#13;
&#13;
Q3. In what way is WBI not aligned with the CAS? (e.g., sector, approach)&#13;
&#13;
All respondents felt that WBI was not sufficiently aligned. They notably stressed the&#13;
limited consultations with WBI's counterparts in Operations.&#13;
&#13;
WBI is not sufficiently aligned on the CAS and on the PRSP. We don't have enough&#13;
information on WBI activities. There are not enough consultations of WBI with&#13;
counterparts in Operations.&#13;
&#13;
Not enough coherence with the CAS because there are no close relations between WBI&#13;
and the Country Team.&#13;
&#13;
Not aligned because there is no consultation with Operations.&#13;
&#13;
WBI links with other World Bank programs are visible such as in budgetary support.&#13;
However, WBI activities are not aligned on the annual programs of the World Bank in&#13;
the country e.g., Annual Program of rural development.&#13;
&#13;
One problem is that the tools developed by WBI are often complex and difficult to use by&#13;
the Ministry staff. WBI should involve the University of Ouagadougou in method and tool&#13;
development to ensure they are fit to the context and easy to use. Post-training follow-up&#13;
should be systematic, so that participants are able to use the new knowledge to have a&#13;
better implementation of the projects and programs. The lack of monitoring and follow-&#13;
up support should be addressed by WBI.&#13;
&#13;
Q4. What was the extent and nature of your involvement in WBI activities during&#13;
FY02 and FY03?&#13;
&#13;
WBI staff do consult with operational staff. However, the nature of the consultation is&#13;
mostly occasional and on specific points. Few reported a sustained involvement with&#13;
WBI at the strategic as well as implementation level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                       97&#13;

Country Program       3    0    3   I discussed with the Country Program Brief mission. Then I&#13;
Brief                               participated in a debriefing meeting when the draft was&#13;
                                    presented in June, 2003. Since this meeting, I have no&#13;
                                    more information on the Program and his final version.&#13;
&#13;
                                    I was asked to give comments on the draft document.&#13;

Needs assessment      2    2    2   I have participated in a meeting organized by WBI to&#13;
                                    present its strategy.&#13;
&#13;
                                    In the past few months, I have regularly been asked to&#13;
                                    contribute to needs assessment of activities on rural&#13;
                                    development and to the selection of relevant activities.&#13;

Recommending local    3    1    2   I have helped WBI to build partnerships with local private&#13;
partners                            training organizations: IPD/AOS, INADES, CECI.&#13;
                                    For training sessions, I recommended the collaboration with&#13;
                                    one private training center: IPD/AOS, and one department&#13;
                                    of the University of Ouagadougou: UFR-SEG.&#13;
Recommending          3    1    2   I have been asked many times to recommend local&#13;
instructors                         instructors for training sessions.&#13;
                                    I have often recommended local consultants for learning&#13;
                                    activities.&#13;
Identifying           1    1    4   Sometimes for the training on reproductive health&#13;

                                    leading organizations working in rural development.&#13;
                                    I have helped in identifying participants for training sessions&#13;
                                    in public administration.&#13;
                                    For the training on local governance, I sent invitation letters&#13;

                                    Once in Washington&#13;
                                    Yes, but not recently. My last training with WBI was in 1986.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Q5. Based on what you have seen from WBI activities in FY02-03, to what degree do&#13;
you think that they met the capacity enhancement needs of Burkina Faso? On a&#13;
scale of 1 to 7, (where 1 is "did not meet BF needs" and 7 "totally met BF needs"),&#13;
how would you rate them?&#13;
&#13;
The average rating was 3.5. Two respondents said 5, one said 4, one said 3, and two said&#13;
2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q6. Do you know of any outcomes (medium-term) that resulted from WBI FY02-03&#13;
activities? If yes, please describe, in what sector, what changed, and how WBI was&#13;
instrumental?&#13;
&#13;
None of the interviewees could report any outcomes that resulted from WBI FY02-03&#13;
activities yet. (6 of 6)&#13;
&#13;
Regarding the outcomes of WBI, I don't know if there is any change and in what sector.&#13;
What I can state is that through WBI learning activities, people are more aware of the&#13;
sectors in which the World Bank operates all over the world. The interest for WBI&#13;
activities is growing since there are more and more participants in the sessions.&#13;
&#13;
No, I have not yet seen any outcomes of WBI activities.&#13;
&#13;
No. I don't have any information on any outcomes of WBI activities.&#13;
&#13;
No. I don't know of any action plan that has been elaborated to put the new knowledge&#13;
and skills into practice.&#13;
&#13;
No. (2)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q7. What are the main barriers to applying new knowledge toward change in&#13;
Burkina Faso?&#13;
&#13;
Four interviewees listed barriers related to WBI. Four respondents listed barriers related&#13;
to the country. One interviewee did not respond.&#13;
&#13;
The main barriers related to WBI were:&#13;
&#13;
Lack of follow-up (3)&#13;
&#13;
Lack of a framework of consultation after the learning activities to draw lessons and&#13;
learn from errors, lack of follow-up, lack of action plan,&#13;
&#13;
Lack of follow-up and regular assessment (2)&#13;
&#13;
One-off events (2)&#13;
&#13;
The fact that WBI activities are one-off training sessions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                       99&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Lack of repetition of training sessions: only one session is not sufficient&#13;
&#13;
Lack of critical mass (2)&#13;
&#13;
WBI trains a very small proportion of people from public, private and civil society&#13;
organizations.&#13;
&#13;
WBI covers only few people per organizations (one or two participant from an&#13;
organization cannot introduce any change in an organization or in the country).&#13;
&#13;
Lack of consistency with other WB programs (1)&#13;
&#13;
Lack of global coherent program in relation with other World Bank's programs in the&#13;
country. WBI activities do not help the implementation of World Bank projects.&#13;
&#13;
Lack of participant management involvement in the participant training (1)&#13;
&#13;
Participants' top management is not sufficiently involved in the learning activities. As a&#13;
result, some participants experienced hurdles in trying to implement new knowledge, as&#13;
their management did not see the value of a new approach.&#13;
&#13;
Too technical (1)&#13;
&#13;
Tools not easy to use, too technical.&#13;
&#13;
The main barriers related to the country were:&#13;
&#13;
The main barriers come from the global work environment in the country: weak capacity&#13;
in policy design, and in priority setting.&#13;
&#13;
Weak capacity in policy design&#13;
&#13;
There has been no political decision related to what to do after the training sessions.&#13;
&#13;
The government lacks a global vision in capacity enhancement, coordination of learning&#13;
activities, and coherence in actions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q8. In your opinion, are there areas where WBI is uniquely positioned to deliver&#13;
capacity enhancement activities in Burkina Faso? Why? What does WBI bring--or&#13;
could bring--to the country that others don't?&#13;
&#13;
Studies and other activities to help with strategic directions and their implementations (6)&#13;
&#13;
WBI should first do a study of the main constraints to capacity enhancement in Burkina&#13;
Faso&#13;
&#13;
Helping the country in elaborating capacity enhancement strategies&#13;
&#13;
Enhancing the country leaders' capacities in policy design and priority setting&#13;
&#13;
Governance&#13;
&#13;
Poverty reduction strategy implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
100&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Focus on PRSP implementation: how to help achieve the development goals defined in&#13;
the poverty reduction strategy revised document&#13;
&#13;
Needs assessment&#13;
&#13;
WBI should develop a system for regular assessment of learning activities&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring and assessment&#13;
&#13;
Develop partnerships (3)&#13;
&#13;
WBI should develop a close cooperation with the Ecole Nationale d'Administration et de&#13;
Magistrature, and Ecole Nationale des Régies Financières on the development and&#13;
implementation of training activities to ensure the sustainability and real impact of the&#13;
activities that will be part of the program of these training centers.&#13;
&#13;
Build partnerships with local training centers or individual consultants for course&#13;
content development to ensure the sustainability of training through repetitions.&#13;
&#13;
Development of course materials, but WBI should not work itself in the development of&#13;
course content should but let the local partners, focal point and local trainers carry out&#13;
this task, because they know the context and the participants' constraints better.&#13;
&#13;
Materials development (1)&#13;
&#13;
Tools and materials development&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q9. In your opinion, are there areas where WBI should reduce its activities? Why?&#13;
&#13;
Two interviewees made suggestions on where to reduce WBI activities:&#13;
&#13;
Training through Internet because of the following reasons: (1) Weak development of&#13;
information technology (lack of computers, lack of knowledge in using computers), (2)&#13;
Very high cost of Internet connections, very low flow, (3) Difficult access to the Internet&#13;
&#13;
Areas where WBI has no confirmed expertise&#13;
&#13;
Three interviewees said that they did not have enough information to answer:&#13;
&#13;
It is difficult for me to answer this question since I don't have enough information on&#13;
WBI learning activities. (3)&#13;
&#13;
One interviewee did not have any suggestion:&#13;
&#13;
I don't know any.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         101&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Q10. Do you think there should have been things done differently by WBI or&#13;
yourself to better serve the capacity enhancement needs of the country? Have you&#13;
shared any such "lessons learned" with the WBI task manager(s) in charge?&#13;
&#13;
Improve coordination and communication between WBI and the Operations (4)&#13;
&#13;
More information sharing between the World Bank office and WBI remains desirable,&#13;
especially since Burkina Faso is a focus country, and a more country specific approach&#13;
can be highly beneficial. Staff working at sectoral levels know the real problems and&#13;
challenges, and could make use of the products of the WBI, even in the execution of their&#13;
regular tasks. There is a lack of collective memory of activities and results at country&#13;
level. I have shared my opinion on needs assessment, and on the necessity that the&#13;
Country Program Brief takes into account what was said during the mission, e.g., the&#13;
needs in the area of regulation, monitoring and evaluation. I have discussed also with the&#13;
Country Team and asked those in charge of sectors to give their points of view and give&#13;
comments on the draft document.&#13;
&#13;
Develop close collaboration between WBI and the Country Team (3)&#13;
&#13;
Create a local focal point for WBI / Develop local partnerships (4)&#13;
&#13;
Have a focal point in the country with a clear mandate (2)&#13;
&#13;
WBI should develop more cooperation with local public and private training centers and&#13;
individual consultants.&#13;
&#13;
More involvement of local partners in WBI activities at all stages: research centers,&#13;
public (ENAM, ENAREF) and private training centers, independent consultants.&#13;
&#13;
WBI should lead a study on the existing capacities on training in the country.&#13;
&#13;
Improve alignment with the country's priorities, programs and needs (3)&#13;
&#13;
Alignment of WBI activities on the CAS&#13;
&#13;
Ensure that there is coherence between WBI activities and the other WB Operations in&#13;
the country&#13;
&#13;
Develop concrete training activities that match with the context of the country and focus&#13;
learning activities on the real needs of participants&#13;
&#13;
Follow up (2)&#13;
&#13;
Hold meetings with the Ministry of health to discuss what has been done and how to&#13;
bring improvements&#13;
&#13;
Develop a system of assessment based not only on the responses of participants but also&#13;
follow up to check if there has been real enhancement of participant capacities.&#13;
&#13;
Use Francophone instructors (1)&#13;
&#13;
WBI should avoid using non-francophone instructors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
102&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Q11. Do you think that the recent move of WBI toward country-focused capacity&#13;
enhancement in Burkina Faso is likely to better assist the country to achieve its&#13;
development goals? If yes, have you already seen early results of this new strategy?&#13;
&#13;
Two interviewees expect positive changes if some conditions are met:&#13;
&#13;
Yes, I think it will bring better results. Some training sessions were planned and if they&#13;
are all effective this will contribute to bring positive change.&#13;
&#13;
There is a positive change, but WBI should ensure that its activities are:&#13;
(a) accompanying the national development policy, (b) more coherent and better planned&#13;
with other partners, (c) involving rural development stakeholders in WBI activities, e.g.,&#13;
Swiss cooperation, INADES, IPD/AOS.&#13;
&#13;
Two interviewees mentioned the lack of noticeable changes:&#13;
&#13;
I don't see any change. There seems to be no difference with what was done in the past.&#13;
Not enough communication and consultation with the country's institutions.&#13;
&#13;
So far, I have not seen any result of this strategy. There is still much to be done to adapt&#13;
the offering of learning services to the needs and the context of the country.&#13;
&#13;
Two interviewees said that it was too soon to see a difference:&#13;
&#13;
Moving toward country-focused capacity enhancement in Burkina Faso is a good idea,&#13;
but now, it is too early to talk about some results.&#13;
&#13;
No, it is too soon to see any results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q12. Taking a more forward looking approach, what are some ways in which WBI&#13;
can assist the country in moving closer to its development goals?&#13;
&#13;
Better coordinate with country teams and local partners (4)&#13;
&#13;
Better align WBI activities with to the country's needs (4)&#13;
&#13;
Identify priorities in relation to the PRSP&#13;
&#13;
Finalize the Country Program Brief, following what the country has expressed as&#13;
capacity enhancement needs.&#13;
&#13;
Integrate WBI learning activities with a global capacity enhancement program&#13;
&#13;
Ensure that the training team has a good knowledge of the World Bank strategy and the&#13;
ongoing projects&#13;
&#13;
WBI programs should be planned for three-years and follow the CAS cycle.&#13;
&#13;
Try to respond to the country's expectations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                        103&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Establish local partnership, create a focal point and collaborate with key stakeholders (4)&#13;
&#13;
Build partnerships with local training centers&#13;
&#13;
Develop more communication with the local institutions and individuals&#13;
&#13;
Have a focal point that is well known by all in the country&#13;
&#13;
Have a person playing the role of interface in the Ministry of Economy and Development&#13;
&#13;
WBI should work with the Parliament.&#13;
&#13;
More consultation with the country team&#13;
&#13;
Suggested learning activities (2)&#13;
&#13;
Focus on enhancing the country's capacity in policy design at all levels: public, civil&#13;
society, private sector&#13;
&#13;
WBI should develop sessions on women rights and AIDS&#13;
&#13;
WBI should develop specific training for women group leaders to enhance their&#13;
capacities in lobbying, conducting advocacy activities, and networking. There is an&#13;
interesting report on an assessment of a project in Guinea that is worth reading.&#13;
&#13;
Improve learning activities (2)&#13;
&#13;
Improve the existing trainings&#13;
&#13;
Share with participants the goods practices developed in other countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(Q13) Probe: "How could WBI help Burkina Faso `promote gender equality and&#13;
empower women'?"&#13;
&#13;
When probed, interviewees suggested that WBI should undertake a factual study of how&#13;
gender is mainstreamed in Burkina Faso to enhance the understanding of other&#13;
stakeholders on the issue. (5) Then, WBI could assist the country with the elaboration of&#13;
a national strategy on mainstreaming gender (3), and develop collaboration with local&#13;
gender experts (2).&#13;

            The impact of WBI FY02-03 activities on
            participants from Burkina Faso : a baseline assessment
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report is part of a series of
            country-focus baseline evaluations undertaken by the
            Institute Evaluation Group to assess the perceived impact of
            WBI activities on their alumni, and through them on their
            organizations and countries, before or just when WBI started
            to implement its country-focus approach. The current report
            is on Burkina Faso. The report aims to assess how
            country-focused, relevant, effective, useful, influential,
            and sustainable observed WBI learning activities were, and
            which factors boosted or mitigated their performance. The
            study also explores the early effects of the country-focus
            approach and highlights gender issues. The report examined
            the factors explaining activity performance in five areas:
            relevance to Burkina Faso's needs, relevance to
            participants' work, effectiveness, use of the knowledge
            and skills by participants, and perceived changes induced by
            the activities. The report is organized as follows. The
            first chapter introduces the evaluation design, while
            subsequent chapters address the following main evaluation
            questions: How country-focused on Burkina Faso were the
            observed FY02-03 WBI activities? (Chapter Two); How relevant
            were these activities? (Chapter Three); How effective were
            these activities? (Chapter Four); What were their outcomes?
            (Chapter Five); What changes did they induce? (Chapter Six);
            Are WBI activities sustainable? (Chapter Seven).
