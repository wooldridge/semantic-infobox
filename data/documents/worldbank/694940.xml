LATVIA&#13;
HIGHWAY PROJECT&#13;
I.  ECONOMIC BACKGROUND AND THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
1.1.   Latvia, a country of 2.6 million people and 64,600 square km, achieved its independence in&#13;
1991, following the collapse of the Former Soviet Union. Average GNP per capita was US$ 2420 in&#13;
1995. The country is located on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea, bounded by Estonia to the north,&#13;
Lithuania to the south, and Russia and Belarus to the east.&#13;
1.2.   The country has taken major steps to transform its economy from a centrally planned to a&#13;
market oriented basis. An IMF-supported stabilization program has helped to liberalize prices and&#13;
uncouple the Latvian currency from the ruble zone. A Latvian currency, the Lat (Ls), was introduced&#13;
in 1993. Successful implementation of the stabilization program enabled the country to pursue an&#13;
independent monetary policy and to reap the benefits of a prudent fiscal policy. As a result, inflation&#13;
has sharply declined from over 900 percent in 1992 to 25 percent in 1995. The trade regime is largely&#13;
liberalized and other structural reforms are underway, supported by a Structural Adjustment Loan&#13;
approved in December 1996. Institutional changes needed to adapt Latvia to the new situation are in&#13;
progress, and the country's financial situation is still in transition. However, the country has weathered&#13;
the severe banking crisis that affected it in 1995. In early 1996, the Government's tightening of fiscal&#13;
policy and improved economic policies resulted in encouraging economic results, and the economy is&#13;
slowly recovering from the steep decline in output that accompanied the breakup of the Soviet Union.&#13;
Latvia's aspiration to become a member of the European Community hinges on its long-term exchange&#13;
rate stability, deepening of structural reform, and increase in income levels.&#13;
1.3.   The transport sector plays a key role in the Latvian economy due to the country's location.&#13;
The transport and communication sector accounted for 19.4 percent of the Gross Domestic Product in&#13;
1994. Freight shipments from Russia and other CIS countries to the West are the core of the transit&#13;
industry in Latvia. The centers of the freight transit industry are the seaports of Riga, Ventspils and to&#13;
a lesser extent Liepaja. Thirty five million tons of cargo and 80 percent of the country freight turnover&#13;
were due to seaports in 1994. Rail was the second dominant transport mode with 17 percent of the&#13;
country's freight turnover, and was mainly oriented to transit freight, which accounted for 73 percent&#13;
of its traffic. Roads accounted for forty percent of the goods transported in tons but only 2.5 percent of&#13;
the country's freight turnover, emphasizing the role of truck transport for short hauls.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Road Sub-Sector                                                                   2&#13;
II.    THE ROAD SUB-SECTOR&#13;
2.1.   Overview.    The Latvian road network appears adequate in terms of size for the present and&#13;
near future traffic volume, but more than one third of roads are in poor condition. The road safety&#13;
situation in Latvia is one of the worst in Europe. The institutions in the road sector have been going&#13;
through drastic changes in their way of working since Independence. The Road Department of the&#13;
Ministry of Transport has been and still is in the forefront of the transformation process in Latvia. The&#13;
Latvian Road Administration was reorganized to foster an economically efficient management and the&#13;
road construction and design companies were privatized.  The road safety authorities have been&#13;
reorganized but need strong international support to undertake measures that will reduce the number of&#13;
accidents to Western levels.  Despite the creation of a Road Fund, the budget allocated to road&#13;
maintenance remains insufficient to face the existing backlog of maintenance and to ensure that the road&#13;
network will be optimally maintained. Design standards, monitoring and construction implementation&#13;
need to be upgraded to achieve better quality and lower costs. Latvia has become increasingly aware&#13;
of the environmental impact of road traffic and road activities, and has introduced new environmental&#13;
laws to mitigate their negative impacts.&#13;
A. The Road Network&#13;
2.2.   Public Roads. The national road network in Latvia totals 20,402 kan, of which 38.3 percent&#13;
are bitumenized, 53.7 percent have a gravel pavement and 8.0 percent have an improved earth surface.&#13;
The national road network is categorized in three classes: Main (Primary) Roads; First Class&#13;
(Secondary) Roads; and Second Class (Tertiary) Roads.&#13;

2.3.   The Latvian Road Administration is responsible for 963 bridges totaling 31 km, of which 165&#13;
bridges are located on Main Roads. Bridges are generally small with an average length of 30 meters,&#13;
and 63 percent are more than 25 years old. Most bridges are constructed as precast concrete elements&#13;
in accordance with FSU design standards.&#13;

The Road Sub-Sector                                                                         3&#13;
2.4.   Other Roads. Local roads total from 30,000 to 40,000 km in length. Local roads previously&#13;
maintained by Government authorities such as collective farms are now the responsibility of local&#13;
authorities and private owners. No reliable data concerning private roads are available.&#13;
2.5.   Traffic. Most international transit roads radiate from Riga: from the port of Ventspils via&#13;
Riga to the Russian border; from the port of Liepaja via Riga to the Russian border; the Via Baltica&#13;
(linking Poland and Finland through the Baltic States); and from Riga via Daugavpils to Belarus or&#13;
Russia. Another international link, from Vilnius to St-Petersburg, crosses the southeastern corner of&#13;
Latvia. Around 100 km of roads carry traffic of 4,500 to 15,800 vehicles per day. Around 330 km of&#13;
roads carry 3,000 to 4,500 vehicles per day, while the remaining sections of main roads carry 1,000 to&#13;
2,000 vehicles per day. First Class Roads carry less than 500 vehicles per day and 85 percent of the&#13;
network carries less than 150 vehicles per day. After a 50 percent traffic drop between 1990 and 1993,&#13;
traffic increased by 26 percent in 1994 and 22 percent in 1995.&#13;
2.6.   Adequacy of the Road Network. The public road density is 0.32 km per sq. km compared&#13;
with 0.22 to 0.27 in the Nordic countries. In relation to population, the public road density is 45 fo 70&#13;
percent that of the Nordic countries but Latvia has a lower per capita car ownership (134/1000 versus&#13;
400/1000 in the Nordic countries). Since 85 percent of the road network carries less than 150 vehicles&#13;
per day, the network could be assessed as oversized. However, given the growth in traffic during the&#13;
past two years, the comparison with Nordic countries and the development in cost effective&#13;
maintenance technologies for low traffic roads, the current public road network appears adequate but&#13;
not excessive for meeting the road traffic demand in the future.&#13;
2.7.   The legal single axle weight for trucks is 10 tons while buses are allowed 11 tons per axle. The&#13;
vehicle and axle weight restrictions are not enforced properly, which results in accelerating&#13;
deterioration of the road pavement by overloaded trucks. The bearing capacity of some bridges needs&#13;
to be increased for use by modern heavy trucks to avoid costly traffic diversion or premature&#13;
deterioration.&#13;
2.8.   Road Condition.  A road survey was carried out in 1994 by the consulting firm COWI-&#13;
BCEOM based on visual inspection, and the results were set forth in a report entitled " Survey of Road&#13;
Rehabilitation and Maintenance in the Baltic Countries - Country report, Latvia " dated May 1995.&#13;
This survey considered two parameters to classify the roads in three different categories (poor, fair,&#13;
good): the roughness, which is the main parameter influencing vehicle operating costs, and the degree&#13;
and type of road distress, which enables forecasting the life expectancy of the road structure. The&#13;
results of this study are given as follows:&#13;

2.9.   Bridge Condition. Bridge maintenance has been neglected for many years. More than half of&#13;
the bridges suffer from deferred maintenance and are in need of substantial repair. Common problems&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Road Sub-Sector                                                                       4&#13;
are the poor condition of joints, malfunctioning water proof layer, and thin concrete cover, all of which&#13;
have resulted in damage to steel reinforcements. Latvian Road Administration (LRA) bridge engineers&#13;
have systematically inspected bridges visually and recorded their deterioration, but they have not had&#13;
access to appropriate test equipment or inspection platforms, and little repair has been carried out. On&#13;
the Main Roads, among the 162 bridges, ten are considered in " high emergency condition " and 50 in&#13;
" emergency" condition. The LRA has received the US Bridge Management System Pontis free of&#13;
charge and the Latvian bridge experts are testing it to determine its appropriateness.&#13;
B. Road Safety&#13;
2.10.  The road safety situation in Latvia is one of the worst in Europe, with 19.9 fatalities per 10,000&#13;
vehicles in 1995 (see Annex K). The 22 percent decrease observed in recorded accidents (Table 2.4.)&#13;
between 1990 and 1993 was due to the 50 percent decrease in traffic. In 1994, the number of accidents&#13;
increased by 10 percent when traffic increased again, following the improvement in the Latvian&#13;
economy. In 1995, the number of killed decreased by 14.8 percent, while the number of serious&#13;
accidents increased by 6.3 percent and the number of injured increased by 11.9 percent. The decrease&#13;
in fatalities is generally attributed to the introduction of the mandatory use of seat belts at the beginning&#13;
of 1995. The Government has begun to take significant steps to remedy the poor road safety situation&#13;
(see paras. 2.23 &amp; 2.24.).&#13;
2.11.  Cause of Accidents. While the number of accidents caused by trucks (8.1 percent of all 1995&#13;
accidents) decreased by 61 percent between 1991 and 1995, accidents caused by cars (78.8 percent of&#13;
all 1995 accidents) increased by 53 percent. Poor driver behavior, including disregard of speed limits&#13;
and drunken driving, appears to be the main reason. The difference in operating speeds of Western&#13;
and FSU vehicles and the poor condition of brakes or shock absorbers of some FSU vehicles often&#13;
increase the severity of accidents. Police reports indicate an increase by 170 percent in car accidents&#13;
due to speed violations between 1991 and 1994. In 1995, 56.4 percent of accidents caused by drivers&#13;
were linked with high speed and 35.2 percent with alcohol.&#13;

2.12. Location and Type of Accidents. In 1995, the urban road network accounted for 74 percent&#13;
of registered accidents, causing 62 percent of the injured and 43 percent of the fatalities; highways&#13;
accounted for 26 percent of the accidents causing 57 percent of the fatalities. The number of accidents&#13;
on highways decreased by 15 percent in 1995 compared with 1991 and the level of fatalities reached its&#13;
lowest level since 1989. The major types of serious accidents were collisions between pedestrians and&#13;
cars (37.2 percent of serious accidents in 1995), collisions between cars (24.5 percent) and exit from&#13;
the road (18.5 percent). Eighteen percent of the accidents accounting for 77 fatalities were partially&#13;
caused by road conditions. By reaching the EU level of road safety, Latvia would avoid 300 fatalities a&#13;
year (Annex K).&#13;
C. Highway Organization&#13;
2.13. Overview. The Road Department (LRD) of the Ministry of Transport (MOT) has the overall&#13;
responsibility for the management of the Latvian national road network.  The Latvian Road&#13;
Administration (LRA), a government agency under MOT's jurisdiction, has the operational&#13;
responsibility for carrying out maintenance and new construction for the National Road Network.&#13;
Private engineering  companies prepare the design of major road projects, Regional Road&#13;
Administrations (RRAs) or private contractors carry out works on a contract basis, and the Central&#13;
Laboratory in Riga tests quality independently. The Latvian Road Safety Directorate (LRSD), also a&#13;
government agency under MOT's jurisdiction, coordinates road safety activities.&#13;
2.14. The LRD. The LRD, staffed with 14 people, is responsible for overall road policy, road&#13;
strategy and transport planning.  This includes the following tasks: (i) development of strategic&#13;
programs for roads and road transport; (ii) development of legislative and regulatory acts; (iii)&#13;
coordination with local authorities; (iv) preparation of budget and financial planning; and (v) foreign&#13;
relations.&#13;
2.15. The LRA. The LRA, staffed with 50 persons, is responsible for the following activities: (i)&#13;
the annual investment planning for the national road network according to LRD strategic plans and&#13;
traffic forecasts; (ii) the management, supervision and maintenance of the national road network; and&#13;
(iii) the environmental impact of road activities. To carry out these activities, the LRA has seven&#13;
divisions in charge of : (i) organization of construction work and contract approval (Production&#13;
Division); (ii) road maintenance for the national road network (Road Maintenance Division); (iii) data&#13;
bank, pavement and bridge management systems, and technical standards (Technical Division); (v)&#13;
equipment and land purchase (Mechanics Division); (vi) internationally financed projects management&#13;
(Project Implementation Division or PIU -see para 2.17.); (vi) financial planning (Planning Division);&#13;
and (vii) accounting. Prior to Independence, LRA relied on 26 District Offices for maintenance of the&#13;
national road network and a number of publicly owned design institutes and construction companies for&#13;
road design and new construction. This organization has been changed and now LRA carries out its&#13;
construction and maintenance on a contract basis (see LRA Organization Chart in Annex A).&#13;
2.16.  Units under LRA's Responsibility.  (a) The District State Road Management Units (MiUs).&#13;
LRA has created twenty-six MUs of three persons each, which report to its Road Maintenance Division&#13;
(RMD) (see organization chart in Annex A). Every month, the MUs assess the needs of each District&#13;
in terms of maintenance and request funds from the RMD, which prioritizes the works to be carried out&#13;
in the country. Once the RMD completes the national prioritization and allocates funds, the MUs&#13;
contract out work to public or private enterprises and control the quality of the executed works through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Road Sub-Sector                                                                       6&#13;
its own inspections supported by tests performed by the Central Laboratory. Since MUs have been&#13;
established recently, substantial staff training is needed to assure an adequate level of quality control.&#13;
2.17.  (b) The Pro ject Implementation Unit (PIU). A PIU has been set up as a division of the LRA to&#13;
manage the EBRD Highway Rehabilitation project (see Para. 2.25). The PIU prepares the bidding&#13;
documents according to international standards and lets contracts following EBRD procurement&#13;
guidelines. The overall project planning schedule is performed by the PIU while detailed project plans&#13;
are prepared on each work site by site supervisors.&#13;
2.18. Reorganization Study. Under the EBRD financed project, a road maintenance reorganization&#13;
study is being carried out by the consultant firm Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick. This study focuses on six&#13;
major aspects: (i) optimization of the distribution of funds between various maintenance activities; (ii)&#13;
enhancement of contracting out; (iii) introduction of more efficient maintenance technologies and&#13;
review of the existing ones; (iv) reduction of the number of Regional Road Administrations (RRAs)&#13;
from 26 to five or six; (v) reduction of road maintenance costs; and (vi) introduction of methodologies&#13;
to assess the value of LRA assets (bridge, roads) and to strengthen LRA in developing appropriate road&#13;
user charges. The study was completed in December 1996, and LRA plans to modify its structure&#13;
accordingly.&#13;
2.19. Design Enterprises. The only large road design enterprise in Latvia, Celuprojekts, is a former&#13;
public corporation that has become a private joint stock company mostly staffed with engineers from&#13;
the former Road Design Institute. That company's activities include design, planning, and economic&#13;
studies in cooperation with international consultants on almost every large road project in Latvia,&#13;
including Via Baltica. All of Celuprojekts' income is from contracts for work performed, 30 percent of&#13;
which is for the LRA.&#13;
2.20. The RRAs. The LRA has turned the 26 District Offices into 26 publicly owned road&#13;
maintenance enterprises called Regional Road Administrations (RRAs), which carry out routine&#13;
maintenance on a unit price basis for the LRA. The RRAs are also permitted to carry out work on a&#13;
contract basis for either public or private entities. The RRAs' income comes entirely from contracts&#13;
performed.&#13;
2.21.  Construction Enterprises.  After Independence, the Latvian road construction enterprises&#13;
radically modified their structures and methods of operation in order to survive in a difficult economic&#13;
environment. All of the enterprises changed from state-owned enterprises to private companies after&#13;
being sold to individuals through the privatization process. These enterprises created an association&#13;
called " Latvian Road Builders " in February 1995 that currently has 21 members. The association&#13;
communicates with LRA officials on quality/tender issues and with other associations, technological&#13;
institutes, consultants and foreign companies in order to improve the members' technical competence.&#13;
The association also checks the contractors' qualifications. With the contraction in road construction&#13;
and maintenance work that has occurred since 1991, contractors have had difficulty keeping a&#13;
minimum turnover to break even, and uncertainties about the availability of future work make it&#13;
difficult to invest in new equipment. Contractors do not have their own fully equipped laboratories to&#13;
test quality, and therefore they usually use the Central Laboratory. Only two of the companies have&#13;
staff who took part in training abroad. Almost all of the 21 companies belonging to the association&#13;
managed to get some contracts financed under the EBRD Highway Rehabilitation project in 1995.&#13;
Some contractors carry out routine maintenance for municipalities (patching/cleaning) and in some&#13;
cases manage to offer lower prices than local force account administrations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Road Sub-Sector                                                                      7&#13;
2.22. Central Laboratory. The Central Laboratory, which was part of LRA prior to Independence,&#13;
was reorganized in 1993. It has been established as a public corporation, and was substantially reduced&#13;
in size, now employing a staff of 16 persons. The main part of the financing comes from contracts for&#13;
tests carried out for the LRA and for private construction companies. One hundred fifty different tests&#13;
can be performed. However, many tests are outdated, and new testing equipment is needed to check&#13;
and benefit from state of the art pavement design and specifications. The laboratory's tasks include the&#13;
development of new technical specifications for materials. The asphalt laboratory works mainly on hot&#13;
mix design. A Technology Transfer Center called T2 financed by the American Federal Highway&#13;
Department (FHD) is attached to the Central Laboratory.&#13;
2.23.  The LRSD. The Government began to address road safety issues in a serious and systematic&#13;
way in 1992 by establishing a Road Safety Directorate (LRSD), a semi-autonomous public entity&#13;
reporting to the Ministry of Transport, to coordinate all road safety activities in Latvia. A modern&#13;
accident reporting system was introduced at the beginning of 1995 and is used by the Traffic Police to&#13;
record accident data. The LRSD staff enters accident data into a computerized accident analysis system&#13;
(MAAP) to identify accident black spots and road safety evolution.  The LRSD  defines the&#13;
requirements for obtaining drivers licenses, and promoted the enactment of mandatory wearing of seat&#13;
belt or new speed regulations (50 km/h in cities and 90 on highways). It also prepares training&#13;
programs for young children in close cooperation with the Ministry of Education. The LRSD is self-&#13;
financing from penalties and fees from transport vehicle registration, drivers licenses, and vehicle&#13;
inspection as a result of the vehicle registration and inspection system established in 1994. However,&#13;
remedial measures that require civil works are financed from the LRA's budget and not from LRSD's.&#13;
2.24. A consultant consortium including the consulting firms Viatek and SweRoad has been awarded&#13;
a contract, financed by EU Phare, to prepare the "Masterplan for the Maintenance, Development and&#13;
Operation of the Road Network and Road Safety Program". Under these consultant services, the&#13;
consultants will give an assessment of the road safety situation in Latvia and prepare a road safety&#13;
improvement program, which would identify institutional strengthening that is needed in Latvia,&#13;
including a review of legislation and law enforcement. The treatment of accident black spots (from&#13;
selection of the proper remedial measure to economic evaluation of the treatment) is another field for&#13;
which LRA and the LRSD need to develop their expertise, since it has proven to be a cost-effective&#13;
way of reducing the rate of accidents.&#13;
D. Highway Planning and Expenditures&#13;
2.25. History of Latvian Road Financing. Prior to Independence, the road sector was financed by&#13;
the state budget at an average level of US$ 115 million per year, which provided for an adequate level&#13;
of routine and periodic maintenance and for development of the road network.  Road budgets&#13;
dramatically decreased after Independence, with the 1992 budget at a level of only one tenth of the&#13;
1991 budget in real terms. To offset the lack of state budget financing, the Latvian Ministry of Finance&#13;
introduced a Road Fund, and since the funds raised were still insufficient to overcome the existing&#13;
backlog of maintenance, LRA sought foreign financing. The Road Fund, established as a Resolution&#13;
of the Cabinet of Ministers, is based on a vehicle tax, transit fees and fuel excise taxes (collected at the&#13;
border). It started accumulating funds in April 1994. It now provides 80 percent of LRA's financing.&#13;
Seventy percent of the Road Fund is allocated to LRA, while the remaining thirty percent goes to&#13;
municipalities and other entities maintaining local roads. In 1996, excise taxes on fuel were increased&#13;
to US$ 0.2/liter compared to US$ 0.08/liter previously. The LRA expected that income from the fuel&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Road Sub-Sector                                                                  8&#13;
excise and transportation taxes would increase from 17.6 million Lats in 1995 to 30.3 million Lats in&#13;
1996 following this increase. For 1996 and beyond, the Road Fund is expected to be the only domestic&#13;
resource for road maintenance. Since the existing law could be changed at any time, an agreement was&#13;
reached during negotiations that provides for the possibility of suspension of disbursements in the event&#13;
of a change that adversely affects LRA's ability to fulfill its functions of maintaining the road network&#13;
(see para. 6.1.(i)). The second major source of financing for road maintenance is foreign rmancing,&#13;
which comes from development institutions such as EBRD, the JEXIM Bank, the Kuwait Fund and the&#13;
World Bank. An EBRD-JEXIM Highway Project for US$ 26.8 million (EBRD: US$ 10.4 million;&#13;
JEXIM: US$ 10.4 million; Ministry of Transport: US$ 6 million) to repave portions of the road&#13;
network and construct the Jelgava Bypass was obtained in 1994. Funds became available in 1995, and&#13;
the major construction was carried out in 1996. In 1995, the LRA budget from both domestic and&#13;
foreign sources of financing reached 12.36 million Lats, equivalent to US$ 23.8 million and was&#13;
expected to increase to 28.6 million Lats, equivalent to US$ 52.1 million in 1996 as shown in Table&#13;
2.6. The projections of the Road Fund income and LRA resources are given in Annex L.&#13;

2.26. Budget Preparation. Prior to Independence, the predecessor organization to LRA obtained its&#13;
budget from the central government in Moscow. Traditionally, 20-year road development programs&#13;
were prepared and updated every 5 years. Since Independence, budgets have been prepared by LRA in&#13;
cooperation with the LRD and submitted to the Ministry of Finance on an annual basis, with a separate&#13;
justification for major projects, which are included in an overall Public Investment Program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Road Sub-Sector                                                                  9&#13;
2.27.  Expenditures.  Since Independence, the decrease in LRA's budget as described in para 2.25&#13;
has resulted in a drastic reduction in road maintenance and an almost complete hold on new&#13;
construction except for the completion of partially constructed by-passes included in the EBRD/JEXIM&#13;
financed project. Routine and periodic road maintenance represents about 83 percent share of 1996&#13;
expenditures as shown in Table 2.6, while new road development represents only about 11 percent.&#13;
Every month, the estimated revenues coming from the Road Fund are allocated for road maintenance,&#13;
based on the request of the 26 MUs. The budget for routine maintenance in 1995 enabled the filling of&#13;
potholes on only 5,000 km of the 8,000 km of paved roads and salt spreading for only 2,500 km. Less&#13;
than US$ 2 million was allocated to gravel road maintenance.&#13;

2.28. Annual Budget Needs. With its new Road User Charges, Latvia is expected to come closer to&#13;
a funding level appropriate to perform the optimum maintenance of its road network. A report&#13;
prepared by the consultant COWI/BCEOM made a preliminary estimate of annual maintenance&#13;
financing needs for road maintenance at 40 million Lats or US$ 73 million to minimize overall&#13;
transport costs. A consultant company is making a more refined assessment of the financing needs of&#13;
the Latvian Road Administration, reviewing the existing Road Fund and relevant Road User Charges in&#13;
a study now being carried out with financing from the EBRD/JEXIM Highway project (see Annex J).&#13;
E. Design, Monitoring and Construction&#13;
2.29.  Design.   Design standards and specifications are established by the Latvian Road&#13;
Administration with the assistance of the Central Laboratory. Most of these standards are still based on&#13;
the FSU design manual for geometric and pavement design. These standards do not take into account&#13;
the research that has been carried out over the past forty years worldwide to achieve better cost&#13;
efficiency in road construction and maintenance. Moreover, the pavements of many Latvian highways&#13;
are not adapted to the high tire pressures and heavy axle loads of modern trucks now performing most&#13;
of the heavy goods transport. LRA is trying to adapt design, specifications, construction technology&#13;
and testing to EU standards for highways. However, the selection of the most cost effective pavement&#13;
technology needs further development.&#13;
2.30. Condition Survey. Regular visual highway inspections are carried out by the RRAs on parts&#13;
of the network in the spring and autumn of each year. Each year the survey covers 100 percent of&#13;
Main Roads, 50 percent of First Class Roads and part of the Second Class Roads. The first survey&#13;
provides a general view of road conditions while the second gives a condition rating of the pavement.&#13;
Some visual roughness surveys have also been carried out. The recent introduction of a profilograph&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Road Sub-Sector                                                                  10&#13;
(laser instrument for measuring road condition) will enable LRA to monitor the road condition of the&#13;
total Main and First Class road network frequently and accurately.&#13;
2.31. Highway Database and Pavement Management System (PMS). A Pavement Management&#13;
System (Belman) is being introduced with the assistance of Danish consultants. The new PMS divides&#13;
the country into 5 zones - Riga, West, North, South, and East. The Riga area was used as a pilot&#13;
project to adapt the system to Latvian conditions. This system has been partially used for the present&#13;
project preparation and will provide LRA with cost benefit analyses for future years maintenance and&#13;
new construction operations.&#13;
2.32. Materials. Most stone materials used as aggregate are imported from Russia or Ukraine and&#13;
crushed in Latvia, but some used for low traffic roads are local. Low skid resistance due to poor&#13;
quality local aggregates is one of the weaknesses of Latvian roads. Bitumen was purchased in Russia&#13;
prior to Independence. However, due to its high paraffin content, Russian bitumen cracked rapidly and&#13;
is difficult to recycle with reliable results. The current quality of Russian bitumen varies greatly from&#13;
one shipment to another and is commonly not delivered on time. Consequently, bitumen is now&#13;
imported from Sweden via Estonia.&#13;
2.33. Construction Quality. The road network constructed during the FSU period was of generally&#13;
adequate design, followed by a period of generous maintenance. However, poor quality control,&#13;
workmanship and materials offset these advantages and resulted in high road traffic costs and in a need&#13;
for premature road rehabilitation and maintenance. In particular, poor drainage, poor compaction,&#13;
incorrect grading of aggregates, use of unsuitable types of bitumen, and uneven bitumen distribution&#13;
have resulted in a road network with many problematic areas where reconstruction/strengthening is&#13;
now required.&#13;
2.34.  Under the procedures recently adopted by LRA, bidders must outline their quality control&#13;
procedures and equipment when bidding for a contract. During project implementation, approximately&#13;
one tenth of the samples taken by contractors are tested again by LRA. In 1994, 20 percent of the&#13;
samples were rejected because of poor compaction. Under recently adopted contracting procedures,&#13;
failure to meet quality requirements results in a retention by LRA of 10 to 25 percent of the contract&#13;
amount.&#13;
F. Environmental Procedures and Issues&#13;
2.35.  Prior to Independence, environmental assessment was not given much attention in Latvia.&#13;
However, since that time, laws have been enacted and institutions established to address environmental&#13;
concerns.  A Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and an Environmental Protection&#13;
Committee are responsible for the environment. The Ministry of Transport deals with environmental&#13;
issues related to transport and has created its own environmental guidelines and procedures. There are&#13;
at least two laws aimed at environment protection: the Law on State Environment Impact Assessment&#13;
dated 9 October 1990 and the Law on Environmental Protection dated 6 August 1991.  An&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment is required for any new or major project, and regulations concerning&#13;
noise limitations and pollution standards close to EU standards are to be introduced in the future. One&#13;
American-Latvian joint venture consultant company has been set up recently in Latvia to carry out&#13;
environmental consultant work on a contract basis.&#13;

The Bank's Experience and Strategy                                                   11&#13;
III. THE BANK'S EXPERIENCE AND STRATEGY&#13;
A. Bank Lending to Latvia&#13;
3.1.   Latvia joined the World Bank on August 11, 1992. On October 22, 1992, the first loan to&#13;
Latvia, a Rehabilitation loan for US$41.9 million (net of cancellation) cofinanced by a US$ 35 million&#13;
loan from JEXIM, was approved to assist the Government in the design and implementation of its&#13;
economic program. This was followed on January 11, 1994, by an Agriculture Development Loan&#13;
supporting private agriculture for US$ 25 million. The Bank approved an Enterprise and Financial&#13;
Sector Loan on September 20, 1994, for US$ 35 million including a credit line, technical assistance for&#13;
large-scale privatization and financing for rehabilitation of the payment system, a Liepaija Environment&#13;
laD for US$ 4 million in December 1994 and a District Heating Project in Jelgava for US$ 14 million&#13;
in May 1995. The Bank approved a Municipal Services Development Project in December 1995 for&#13;
US$ 27.3 million. The Bank approved a Structural Adjustment Loan in December 1996 to be released&#13;
in two tranches: the first tranche of DEM 30.2 million (about US$ 20 million equivalent) was released&#13;
at effectiveness and the second tranche of DEM 60.4 million (about US$ 40 million equivalent) will be&#13;
released on fulfillment of the specific second tranche conditions. The Bank's experience with project&#13;
implementation in Latvia has, on the whole, been satisfactory, and the overall performance by the PIU&#13;
have been good. However, the frequent changes in personnel that handle Bank projects in the Ministry&#13;
of Finance has sometimes led to delays in project implementation. The PIU for this project has already&#13;
shown its capability to handle all aspects of project administration during the execution of the ongoing&#13;
EBRD Highway project.&#13;
B. Strategy and Rationale for IBRD Involvement in Latvia&#13;
3.2.   The Bank's strategy for Latvia, as outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy update discussed&#13;
by the Executive Directors during the presentation of the Structural Adjustment Project on December&#13;
19, 1996, is to support the Government's efforts to deepen structural reforms, in particular with&#13;
emphasis on measures that will stimulate private sector development. Improvements in the country's&#13;
essential infrastructure, including transport, provide the environment necessary for the successful&#13;
development of the private sector.  In terms of structural reforms, emphasis is being placed on&#13;
promoting private sector development and establishing a targeted system of social protection. Sector&#13;
specific interventions to complement the economy-wide efforts will focus on the delivery of social&#13;
services, on energy efficiency and on the rehabilitation of critical infrastructure. In consistency with&#13;
the Country Assistance Strategy update, this project will improve the efficient design of public&#13;
infrastructure investment, rehabilitation and maintenance programs, and support private sector&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Bank's Experience and Strategy                                                    12&#13;
C. Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Projects in the Highway Subsector&#13;
3.3.   The proposed project will be the first IBRD highway project for Latvia. However, the ongoing&#13;
EBRD Highway Project has shown the capability of LRA and its PIU to manage an internationally&#13;
funded project. It has also shown that limiting bidding to local companies results in a poor level of&#13;
competition and high prices. Furthermore, the Bank has had considerable experience in financing&#13;
highway projects in other parts of the world, including Eastern Europe. Much of the Bank's lending&#13;
for highway operations was for road construction up to about 1980. However, the road building boom&#13;
of the 1960s and 1970s created an infrastructure that began to deteriorate rapidly in the late 1970s.&#13;
Road networks had expanded much faster than the corresponding maintenance budgets and institutional&#13;
capacities. Traffic was also increasing at a higher than projected rate, and axle loads often exceeded&#13;
the design capacity of pavements. The serious magnitude of the problem was demonstrated in a policy&#13;
2&#13;
study undertaken by the World Bank in 1987.  The study, which analyzed the extent of deterioration&#13;
of inter-urban main road networks in 85 countries receiving highway subsector assistance from the&#13;
Bank (including IDA), came to some startling conclusions. A quarter of the paved roads outside urban&#13;
areas required reconstruction in the mid-1980s, as did a third of unpaved roads. In addition, another&#13;
40 percent of the paved roads of these countries required strengthening. If the countries did not&#13;
improve their maintenance of roads, the eventual annual cost of maintenance could easily increase by&#13;
two or three times, and the cost to road users would rise even more.&#13;
3.4.   Concerned at the ever-growing backlog of road maintenance in borrowing countries, the Bank&#13;
has adopted many of the recommendations of the above policy study in its sector work and investment&#13;
projects. These include: (a) improvement in road planning and programming, including more reliable&#13;
information and management methods and the application of economic criteria, (b) strengthening and&#13;
reform of institutional performance, particularly by contracting out more maintenance activities to the&#13;
private sector, (c) reallocation of resources to balance construction and maintenance with increased&#13;
allocation of expenditures to reduce the maintenance backlog, and (d) improving the financing of roads,&#13;
particularly by the adoption of rational road user charge systems. Lending for roads is generally&#13;
conditional on countries having an appropriate balance of expenditure among new construction,&#13;
restoration and maintenance, depending on the level of road deterioration, and on having a system of&#13;
road user charges that generates most of the resources needed to keep the roads in reasonable&#13;
condition.&#13;
D. Highway Sector Strategy for Latvia&#13;
3.5.   There is an urgent need to prevent the further deterioration of the road network in Latvia,&#13;
particularly for those transit routes that play a large role in Latvia's economy. The project will assist in&#13;
improving the efficiency and adequacy of road maintenance operations, in developing the private&#13;
construction industry, and in improving LRA's management of the road network.   The&#13;
recommendations of the Bank's Road Deterioration Policy Paper (para. 3.3.) are reflected in the&#13;
Latvian Ministry of Transport's strategy for the highway subsector, along with other strategies that are&#13;
specific to the Latvian situation. The Latvian strategy includes: (a) improving road planning, including&#13;
the development of various road management systems; (b) restructuring the highway maintenance&#13;
organization by contracting out periodic maintenance to private sector contractors operating on a&#13;
2    World Bank Policy Study. Road Deterioration in Developing Countries: Causes and&#13;
Remedies. 1988.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Bank's Experience and Strategy                                                       13&#13;
competitive basis; (c) building a small but strong road management organization that utilizes the most&#13;
efficient technology and effective quality control over the private contractors that it employs; (d)&#13;
developing within five years a competitive contracting industry for construction and periodic and&#13;
routine maintenance; (e) shifting the utilization of budget resources to an emphasis on maintenance&#13;
rather than new construction, and (f) increasing road user charges as a basis for providing the resources&#13;
needed for an adequate level of maintenance.&#13;
3.6.   The Bank's strategy for the highway subsector is to assist the Government in meeting this&#13;
challenge through a lending operation that would support expanded maintenance operations with&#13;
priority given to the main connecting routes with surrounding countries, and improvements in&#13;
operational procedures and techniques used in road maintenance activities, while encouraging the&#13;
Government to increase the resources available to meet the future need for road maintenance through&#13;
appropriate road user charges. The project would also include assistance from several bilateral donors&#13;
that are providing technical services and training in support of these objectives.&#13;
3.7.   The Government's ability to carry out its strategy for the road sector will depend on its ability&#13;
to generate the resources needed to do so. The recent increases in road user charges bode well for&#13;
increased budget levels in the future.  Foreign borrowing can assist in reducing the backlog of&#13;
maintenance, while over the longer run the Government must generate the resources needed for&#13;
maintenance from its own recurrent revenue collections. Also, road users should be required to pay&#13;
the costs associated with maintaining the road network in order to put decisions made in the transport&#13;
sector on a comparable basis with other transport modes. The increase in the fuel excise tax is a move&#13;
in the right direction but the Road Fund performance must be carefully scrutinized to assure that it&#13;
actually meets the future financing requirements for road maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                           14&#13;
IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
4.1.   The project would have the overall objective of preserving the Latvian road network and&#13;
minimizing total road transport costs in Latvia (the total road transport cost is the sum of the road user&#13;
costs, the maintenance costs, the construction costs and the accident costs). The specific objectives of&#13;
the project are to:&#13;
(i)       expand the level of periodic maintenance where it is economically justified;&#13;
(ii)      improve the efficiency and quality of the road maintenance by introducing improved&#13;
technology and quality control and by increasing LRA's cost consciousness and economic&#13;
justification capabilities;&#13;
(iii)     support the development of the private road construction and engineering industries;&#13;
(iv)       improve road safety conditions in Latvia; and,&#13;
(v)       establish the mechanism and level of funding required to achieve the minimum total road&#13;
transport cost.&#13;
4.2.   These objectives are consistent with the Bank's desire to assist Latvia in its transition from a&#13;
centrally planned to an efficient market oriented economy. They will enable Latvia to establish the&#13;
management of roads based on cost efficiency, to provide critical transport infrastructure to meet the&#13;
needs of the expanding private sector, and to develop the private construction industry.  These&#13;
objectives will also assist Latvia to strengthen its role as a transport corridor between several major&#13;
production centers in neighboring countries. The achievement of these project objectives will be&#13;
monitored as shown in Annex E.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
4.3.   An IBRD Loan of US$ 20 million combined with cofinancing from the Kuwait Fund, EU&#13;
Phare, Sweden, France and Finland would finance a three-year program of urgently needed highway&#13;
maintenance, and a program of technical services to strengthen institutions and improve road&#13;
maintenance operational efficiency. The total project cost is estimated at US$ 56.9 million. The main&#13;
components of the proposed project are:&#13;
(a)      Periodic Highway Maintenance (US$ 27.0 million).  Repaving/rehabilitation of priority&#13;
sections of the Main and First Class road network consisting of 230 km of overlay and 750&#13;
km of surface dressing. Priority will be given to the roads with the highest Internal Rate of&#13;
Return (IRR) based on detailed pavement surveys and on the results provided by the&#13;
Bellman Pavement Management System.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                              15&#13;
(b)      Bridge Repair and Reconstruction (US$ 12.3 million). Repair and reconstruction of bridges&#13;
in critical condition on the Main and First Class Roads.&#13;
(c)      Road Safety Improvement (US$ 6.0 million).  Design and implementation of remedial&#13;
measures to improve major accident black spots identified during the preparation of the&#13;
project (US$ 2.5 million), and improvement of road safety in the Bauska and lecava Region&#13;
(US$ 3.5 million).&#13;
(d)      Gravel Road Maintenance and Low Cost Bitumenization Techniques (US$ 0.7 million).&#13;
Technical services to introduce cost-efficient maintenance of gravel roads including low cost&#13;
bitumenization and to perform economic evaluation of these techniques (US$ 0.2 million),&#13;
and implementation of pilot projects to complement the technical services (US$ 0.5 million).&#13;
(e)      Equipment for the Central Laboratory (US$ 0.5 million). Laboratory equipment to perform&#13;
European Union-standard testing (US$ 0.5 million).&#13;
(f)      Institutional Strengthening and Training (US$ 0.7 million). This will include services to&#13;
(i) review the detailed design, quality control and supervision under the project (US$ 0.3&#13;
million for highways and US$ 0.1 million for bridges); (ii) improve design procedures and&#13;
prepare a research program to adopt EU standards (US$ 0.1 million); (iii) strengthen the&#13;
local road construction industry through the provision of training for private road&#13;
construction and engineering companies (US$ 0.1 million); and (iv) improve LRA's and&#13;
LRSD's capabilities to identify accident black spots and to design remedial treatments (US$&#13;
0.1 million).&#13;
The project cost estimate also includes physical contingencies as well as price contingencies as&#13;
described in para. 4. 11. for a total amount of US$ 9.7 million.&#13;
C. Detailed Project Description&#13;
4.4.   Periodic Highway Maintenance would include an estimated 230 km of overlay and 750 km of&#13;
surface dressing in order to bring the existing pavements up to an economically optimal level of&#13;
roughness and strength considering existing and future traffic levels. Road sections to be repaired have&#13;
been selected on the basis of road condition surveys on the full Main Road Network followed by&#13;
economic evaluation using the HDM III model to determine the sections and maintenance alternatives&#13;
with the highest rates of return. The survey will be repeated each year taking into account the&#13;
variations in traffic and additional deterioration to determine if any change in prioritization has&#13;
occurred. The detailed pavement design will be based on evaluation and testing of the road conditions&#13;
and use of the Pavement Management System to select the most economic pavement repair alternatives.&#13;
4.5.   Bridge Repair and Reconstruction would include repair, reconstruction and/or strengthening&#13;
of about 15 bridges in critical condition located on main transit routes.  As a result of poor&#13;
maintenance, the bearing capacity of most bridges has decreased to levels requiring traffic diversion in&#13;
the next five years unless the proposed repairs are made. Some of the road bridges also need widening&#13;
to ensure better traffic safety. The economic internal rates of return and net present values were&#13;
calculated for these bridges, but the sequence of repair will be determined on the basis of when each&#13;
bridge is expected to be no longer serviceable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                              16&#13;
4.6.   Road Safety Improvement. This component would include design, training and civil works&#13;
for the improvement or elimination of accident black spots. The Latvian Road Safety specialists would&#13;
be trained in accident black spot identification, design of remedial measures and preparation of&#13;
economic justifications for the remedial measures. In parallel, remedial measures to improve some&#13;
accident black spots identified during project preparation would be implemented.&#13;
4.7.   The Project would also include the design and implementation of a road safety plan for the&#13;
Bauska and lecava Regions, two of the worst in the country in terms of road safety, in cooperation with&#13;
EU-Phare, which is financing 68 percent of the costs on a grant basis. This plan has several&#13;
components: (i) to analyze the traffic safety problems in these regions and the local&#13;
assessment/collection of data on accidents; (ii) to define effective improvement measures for traffic&#13;
safety and implement them; (iii) to develop cooperation between local entities; and (iv) to perform these&#13;
tasks as a pilot project that could be applicable to the whole of Latvia.&#13;
4.8.   Gravel Road Maintenance and Low Cost Bitumenization Techniques. The gravel road&#13;
network in general carries very limited traffic but is used to serve the rural areas. It is important to&#13;
establish the appropriate service level and minimum cost to keep these roads operational. LRA wants&#13;
to reduce the total road and transport costs on gravel roads by introducing improved gravel road&#13;
maintenance techniques and by introducing cost-effective bitumenization techniques for low traffic&#13;
roads. This component would consist of technical services to introduce new technologies and the&#13;
application of these new technology on some test sections. The technical services would address three&#13;
main aspects: (i) an analysis of the present status of gravel roads, standards and techniques; (ii) the&#13;
introduction of state of the art techniques for gravel road maintenance and low cost bitumenization;&#13;
and (iii) the introduction of economic evaluation models to identify the most economic road&#13;
construction and maintenance strategy.  The implementation of test sections would consist of the&#13;
identification, design, economic evaluation and supervision of pilot projects.&#13;
4.9.   Equipment for the Central Laboratory would include laboratory equipment to complement&#13;
the equipment procured under the EBRD highway project and would be based on EU standards in&#13;
terms of testing requirements.&#13;
4.10.  Institutional Strengthening and Training would include the use of foreign technical advisers&#13;
to provide practical assistance to LRA in reviewing detailed design for the bridges and for the highway&#13;
sections included in the project, and in establishing an appropriate contract supervision and quality&#13;
control system, assisted by the services of international consultants for a period of 25 man-months.&#13;
This would be complemented by a review of Latvian design standards, the preparation of a Research&#13;
Program to adapt EU standards to Latvian conditions and the introduction of a new design catalogue.&#13;
Training would be provided to the construction industry to familiarize the contractors and engineering&#13;
companies with contract procedures, to enhance the quality of their services and to develop their skills&#13;
and competitiveness as contractors. On-the-job training would be performed for analysis of accident&#13;
black spots and design of the necessary remedial measures.&#13;
D. Cost Estimates and Financing&#13;
4.11. The estimated cost of the project is US$ 56.9 million net of tax and duties, but including price&#13;
and physical contingencies. The foreign component is US$ 38.3 million, equivalent to 67.3 percent of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                              17&#13;
total project costs. Foreign and local costs were estimated on the basis of June 1996 prices and include&#13;
physical contingencies of ten percent for materials, equipment and civil works amounting to US$ 4.7&#13;
million. Price contingencies amounting to US$ 5.0 million are based on forecasts of inflation for&#13;
foreign supplied goods and services of 2.4 percent per annum and for local costs of 14 percent for&#13;
1997, 11 percent for 1998 and 9 percent for 1999. The estimated cost of the project is given in detail&#13;
in Annex B and is summarized in Table 4.1.&#13;

4.12.  The World Bank would finance US$ 20.0 million or 35 percent of total project costs, the&#13;
Kuwait Fund would finance US$ 15.0 million, EU Phare would finance US$ 5.8 million equivalent,&#13;
Sweden, France and Finland would provide US$ 0.3 million, US$ 0.1 and US$ 0.3 million respectively&#13;
for technical services and training, and the Government of Latvia would finance US$ 15.4 million plus&#13;
any duties and taxes payable on items procured for the project. EU Phare, Sweden, France and&#13;
Finland would provide their financing on a grant basis.&#13;
4.13.  The Ministry of Finance was offered a choice of loan products and selected a US dollar single&#13;
currency loan as the most suitable option. Loans from the IBRD and the Kuwait Fund would be made&#13;
available to LRA through the Ministry of Finance. The local contribution to the project and the&#13;
repayments would be taken from the LRA's share of the Road Fund. Assurances were received during&#13;
negotiations that the Government and LRA would make available the level of resources needed to&#13;
finance their respective share of the project (see Para 6.1 (ii)). The Ministry of Finance has decided to&#13;
exempt the project from VAT for goods contracts awarded to international contractors, but still has to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                          18&#13;
decide whether VAT would be applied to local companies. Where VAT applies, it will be the&#13;
responsibility of the LRA to finance it.&#13;
4.14.  Financial Impact.    There is no additional fiscal claim on the Ministry of Finance from&#13;
either the provision of counterpart funds for the project or for the repayment of the loan since these are&#13;
the responsibility of the LRA and will be financed from funds that would be available to the LRA in&#13;
any event, as noted in para. 4.13. The annual contribution of the LRA to the project would average the&#13;
equivalent of US$ 3.8 million each year for three years and interest would reach a level of US$ 3.0&#13;
million in 2000 (for the World Bank and Kuwait Fund loans together). The repayment of principal and&#13;
interest after the grace period would average US$ 5.1 million annually and would never exceed more&#13;
than 7 percent of LRA's budget, which should be easily manageable (see Annex L). Furthermore, the&#13;
resources to be made available by the LRA as counterpart funds are budget resources that would have&#13;
been used for the same purpose if the loan did not exist (i.e. periodic maintenance), and therefore LRA&#13;
would not have to delay any scheduled and economically justified activities because of the project.&#13;
4.15.     Road User Charges Study. The study of the existing Road Fund Resolution, the future&#13;
requirements for road maintenance, and recommendations for improvements of the existing schedule of&#13;
charges is being financed by EBRD. Assurances were received at negotiations that LRA will carry out&#13;
a study of (a) the required level of financing needed to maintain Latvia's public road network; and (b)&#13;
the possible financing and collection mechanisms for road maintenance, in accordance with terms of&#13;
reference already agreed with EBRD; that LRA will, by June 30, 1997, review the results and&#13;
recommendations of the study with the Bank, and by December 31, 1997, implement recommendations&#13;
of the study agreed with the Bank and EBRD, including presentation to Parliament of any amendments&#13;
to the Road Fund Resolution (para. 6.1 (iii)).&#13;
4.16. The proposed financing plan is as follows:&#13;

E. Status of Cofinancing&#13;
4.17.  Relationship with Other Financing Agencies. Cofinanciers identified for this project include&#13;
the Kuwait Fund, EU-Phare, Sweden, France and Finland. The World Bank would take maximum&#13;
advantage of the technical work carried out under the EBRD project. The Kuwait Fund has indicated&#13;
its willingness to participate in the project, subject to an appraisal and an approval from its Board. The&#13;
Kuwait Fund financing would be on a parallel financing basis. The EU Phare financing would be&#13;
provided as grant on a parallel financing basis. The division of the financial packages has been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                          19&#13;
arranged so that each package would be economically valid on its own, and therefore cross-&#13;
conditionality is not required. Sweden, France and Finland would provide the support for technical&#13;
assistance and institutional training, as mentioned previously. A financing plan per component and per&#13;
financier is shown in Annex B.&#13;
F. Project Implementation&#13;
4.18. Overall project implementation would be managed by the existing Project Implementation Unit&#13;
(PIU) within the LRA. This PIU was created to assist in the implementation of the EBRD project, and&#13;
would continue in operation until this proposed project is completed (see para 6.1 (iv)). It would serve&#13;
as a liaison between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transport and would be the central&#13;
point of contact for the Bank, the Kuwait Fund and other donors supporting the project. The Project&#13;
Manager of the PIU would be responsible for assuring that LRA prepares annual work programs,&#13;
financing plans and periodic reports of the project's progress. The annual financing plan would include&#13;
the level of contribution required from the LRA to finance its part of the project. The Project Manager&#13;
would arrange for audits of project accounts and for the training sessions for contractors. He would&#13;
assure that LRA follows the IBRD Procurement Guidelines. The operating cost of the PIU would form&#13;
part of the contribution of LRA. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that, by November 1 of&#13;
each year during execution of the project, LRA will prepare an annual work program and financing&#13;
plan for the next calendar year for the work to be carried out under the project, and will reach&#13;
agreement on them with IBRD before implementing them. The annual financing plan will include&#13;
financing needed for LRA to finance its share of project activities and a projection of the sources of this&#13;
financing (see para 6.1. (v)).&#13;
4.19. The project implementation schedule and performance monitoring indicators are given in&#13;
Annexes D and E. The schedule is based on the civil works being carried out in the 1997, 1998 and&#13;
1999 construction seasons, with some disbursements carrying over into 2000, and the training and&#13;
technical assistance components extending into 1998.&#13;
4.20.  LRA has stated that economic analysis would be the basis for all its investments during the life&#13;
of the project and that only investments with a positive NPV based on opportunity cost of capital of 10&#13;
percent would be undertaken. To be able to review the economic evaluation process, assurances were&#13;
received at negotiations that by November 1 of each year, LRA would submit to the Bank the results of&#13;
its economic evaluation for its proposed road maintenance and rehabilitation programs for the following&#13;
year and for all of its investment projects, based on LRA's Pavement Management System (see para&#13;
6.1. (vi)), and that it will undertake only investments with a positive NPV based on a 10 percent&#13;
opportunity cost of capital, and will give priority to the investments with the highest ratios of NPV to&#13;
investment costs (see para. 6.1. (vii)).&#13;
G. Procurement&#13;
4.21. The procurement arrangements are included in Annex F, while Table 4.3 summarizes the&#13;
project elements, their estimated costs and proposed methods of procurement. The details of the&#13;
procurement arrangements are set forth in the Procurement Plan and Schedule in Annex G. LRA will&#13;
use the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents, and procurement procedures for IBRD financed contracts&#13;

I/ National Shopping for Materials for the Gravel Road Maintenance Component for US$ 300,000. International&#13;
Shopping for US$ 600,000 Laboratory Equipment (including contingencies).&#13;
4.22. Goods. The Gravel Road Component is a research program developed through small pilot&#13;
projects, some of which will be implemented by RRAs financed directly by LRA and others by private&#13;
construction companies financed by the loan and procured under NCB procedures. For the 6 RRA&#13;
implemented pilot projects scattered over the country, the loan will finance only materials through six&#13;
contracts of approximately US$ 50,000 each awarded under National Shopping. There would be three&#13;
contracts of US$ 200,000 each for the purchase of laboratory equipment for a total estimated amount of&#13;
US$ 600,000. The laboratory equipment would be procured using International Shopping.&#13;
4.23. Civil Works. There would be 14 ICB contracts at an average of US$ 1.36 million for an&#13;
accumulated total estimated cost of US$ 19.1 million, with US$ 14.9 million for repaving, US$ 2.9&#13;
million for bridge rehabilitation, and US$ 1.3 million for road safety improvements. Other civil works&#13;
contracts of less than US$ 500,000 per contract for overlay work, bridge repairs, gravel road pilot&#13;
activities and the improvement of accident black spots would follow NCB procedures using the Sample&#13;
Bidding Documents- Bidding Documents for Procurement of Works-National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB) dated January 1995. Sections of roads selected for overlays would be grouped into suitable&#13;
packages. Each contract package would be kept to a size that could be completed in one construction&#13;
season. There would be around 15 NCB civil works contracts financed jointly by IBRD and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                              21&#13;
Implementing Agency, each contract valued at an average of US$ 320,000 for a total cost estimated at&#13;
US$ 4.8 million.&#13;
4.24.  The introduction of competitive bidding procedures raises a number of issues that grow out of&#13;
the restructuring of force-account agencies and an infant industry. An anticipated area of difficulty is&#13;
the perceived inability of the newly established private firms to meet financial criteria.  The&#13;
construction firms have their accounts audited for control purposes only, if at all. Their accounting&#13;
methodology does not always include western type depreciation of assets, and it might be difficult to&#13;
determine their credit-worthiness. The project would include training for the construction firms, as&#13;
described in Annex J, to update their accounting systems and to facilitate international audits. The&#13;
eligibility of the contractors would be subject to their meeting the criteria outlined under clause 1.8(c)&#13;
of the January 1995 World Bank Procurement Guidelines. Furthermore, RRAs will be allowed to bid&#13;
only if LRA treats them on the same footing as any other contractors. Government or State subsidies&#13;
to these restructured agencies, in any form whatsoever, would disqualify them from participating in&#13;
Bank-financed contracts. Foreign bidders will be permitted to participate in any bidding.&#13;
4.25. Prior Review. Prior review would apply to all ICB contracts, contracts for works above US$&#13;
500,000 and to the first two NCB contracts for works. This level of review should be adequate to&#13;
assure good quality preparation considering the repetitive nature of these contracts.&#13;
4.26.  LRA has experience in implementing this type of project through its involvement with the first&#13;
EBRD project. However, a limited amount of technical support would still be required and will be&#13;
provided through grant financing from EU Phare, Finland, France and Sweden in such areas as&#13;
preparation of World Bank Standard bidding documents and procurement, project management and&#13;
supervision. The Project Launch Workshop referred to in paragraph 4.35 was held in December 1996&#13;
to provide guidance for the preparation of bidding documents for the first construction season. The&#13;
General Procurement Notice has been issued and will be updated annually thereafter.&#13;
4.27.  Consultant Services. Consultants to be financed by IBRD will be selected according to the&#13;
World Bank's Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World&#13;
Bank as an Executing Agency (August, 1981). The major consultancy contract financed by the IBRD&#13;
is for the review of the design and the establishment of an appropriate supervision and quality control&#13;
system for a total amount of US$ 200,000. Prior review by IBRD would apply to all IBRD financed&#13;
contracts for consulting services supplied by firms at more than US$ 100,000 per contract, for&#13;
individuals at more than US$ 50,000 per contract, and for all Terms of Reference. Other consultant&#13;
services for Institutional Strengthening and Training including procurement related Technical&#13;
Assistance are expected to be financed through bilateral sources and will be contracted according to&#13;
their respective procedures with the condition that the Terms of Reference and the qualification of the&#13;
consultants selected by bilateral donors should be acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.28. Procurement information will be collected by the PIU and reported to IBRD as follows:&#13;
(a)    prompt reporting of bidding, bid evaluation results and contract award&#13;
information; and&#13;
(b)    quarterly reports indicating: (i) project progress and problems; (ii) revised cost&#13;
estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including best estimates for&#13;
physical and price contingencies; and (iii) revised schedules of procurement actions,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                           22&#13;
including advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for individual&#13;
contracts.&#13;
H. Disbursements&#13;
4.29.  Disbursements are expected to be completed in four years.  An estimated schedule of&#13;
disbursements is shown in Annex H. The expected closing date is December 31, 2000, about one year&#13;
after completion of the civil works. A comparison can not be made to standard disbursement profiles&#13;
for the Transportation Sector since the project involves only maintenance or limited reconstruction and&#13;
no new construction.&#13;
4.30. The expenditures for contracts for goods valued at less than US$ 200,000 and for works valued&#13;
at less than US$ 500,000 would be reimbursed on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOE)&#13;
procedures. The supporting documentation for these contracts would not be sent to IBRD, but would&#13;
be retained by the borrower for inspection by supervision missions and by external auditors. All other&#13;
disbursements would be fully documented. The minimum size of applications for direct payment and&#13;
for the issuance of Special Commitments would be 20 percent of the amount of the authorized&#13;
allocation to the Special Account.&#13;
4.31.  To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish a Special Account in a&#13;
major commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to IBRD to cover IBRD's share of&#13;
expenditures. During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation of the Special Account would&#13;
be limited to US$ 750,000. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the loan have reached&#13;
the level of US$ 2.0 million, the initial allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation of&#13;
US$ 1.5 million by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal. Replenishment applications&#13;
should be submitted at least every three months, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as&#13;
other appropriate supporting documents.&#13;
4.32. The proceeds of the IBRD loan would be disbursed on the following basis:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                         23&#13;

I. Reporting, Accounting and Auditing&#13;
4.33. The accounting for all Special Account transactions and for all other project-related accounts&#13;
will be maintained in accordance with international accounting standards. Annual financial statements&#13;
of IBRD-financed components and for LRA's overall operations will be prepared in a format acceptable&#13;
to IBRD and audited in accordance with International Auditing Guidelines by suitably qualified&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to IBRD, and submitted to IBRD within six months of the close of&#13;
LRA's financial year. Audits will also be carried out at the same time, and for corresponding periods,&#13;
in accordance with IBRD guidelines, for SOEs against which disbursements have been made or are due&#13;
to be made out of the loan proceeds, and specific reference will be made in the audit reports&#13;
accompanying the financial statements.&#13;
4.34. Quarterly progress reports covering all project components will be prepared by LRA and sent&#13;
to IBRD within one month after the end of each quarter. These reports will include: (a) progress&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                             24&#13;
achieved against agreed implementation and disbursement schedules, and key performance indicators,&#13;
including number of contracts awarded and length of roads rehabilitated/maintained; (b) work programs&#13;
and cost estimates for the coming quarter and for the total project; and (c) procurement information as&#13;
specified in para. 4.28 (b). The main purpose of the reports will be to provide LRA timely and&#13;
updated information on implementation of project components, highlighting issues and problem areas,&#13;
recommending actions and commenting on progress in resolving previous recommendations. LRA will&#13;
also prepare an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) in accordance with IBRD guidelines and&#13;
submit it to IBRD promptly after completion of the project but in any event not later than six months&#13;
after the loan closing date.&#13;
J. Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.35.  Three Bank supervision missions the first year and two the following years, each staffed by a&#13;
senior highway engineer and such specialists as may be appropriate for each phase of the project (such&#13;
as a procurement expert or traffic safety specialist) would be required over the life of the project, each&#13;
of about one to two weeks. The total amount of supervision envisaged annually would be 10-16 staff&#13;
weeks in the field plus six staff weeks in the headquarters. A Project Launch Workshop was held in&#13;
December 1996 with instruction on Bank Procurement Guidelines, disbursement procedures and&#13;
reporting requirements. Subsequent missions would review physical progress and the evolution of&#13;
Implementation and Performance Monitoring Indicators as described in Annexes D &amp; E, and would&#13;
assist in coordinating the cofinanced elements of the project.  Cofinanciers would be invited to&#13;
participate in all supervision missions. A schedule of supervision missions is included as Annex I. A&#13;
mid-term review would be held not later than December 31, 1998, to assess the performance of the&#13;
project and effectiveness of the project arrangements, to review the adequacy of road user charges, and&#13;
for the reallocation of funds between project categories if necessary. In anticipation of this review,&#13;
LRA will prepare a report by October 30, 1998, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
integrating the results of the monitoring and evaluation activities that it has carried out on the progress&#13;
achieved under the project and setting out any measures recommended to ensure the achievement of the&#13;
balance of the project objectives during the remainder of the project implementation period.&#13;
Assurances were received at negotiations on these points ( para. 6.1 (viii)).&#13;
K. Environmental Aspects&#13;
4.36.         The routine and periodic maintenance operations included in the project are not&#13;
expected to generate any significant environmental problems since work would be done on existing&#13;
roadways using existing asphalt plants and quarries. The effects are mainly related to the production of&#13;
asphalt concrete, during which fumes are emitted, the mining of aggregate, and the&#13;
repair/reconstruction of bridges over rivers, which could disturb fish spawning. An environmental&#13;
review has been prepared and concludes that with careful planning of implementation of works and of&#13;
selected remedial measures, the project would have no significant adverse impact. Since the project&#13;
has been rated as Category B, a full Environmental Impact Assessment is not required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project                                                                                25&#13;
L. Program Objective Categories&#13;
4.37.  The project would contribute directly to the sustainable development of Latvia by preserving&#13;
the road network, which is an important part of the country's essential infrastructure, and by making&#13;
Latvia more competitive by reducing transport costs. It would also make a significant contribution to&#13;
the development of the private sector in Latvia through the strengthening of the construction industry.&#13;
M. Poverty Analysis&#13;
4.38.  The project is designed to facilitate overall economic growth, and only indirectly to contribute&#13;
to alleviating poverty. Project implementation requires the equivalent of 30,000 worker man-months,&#13;
thus providing increased job opportunities for Latvian workers. In the longer run, with financing from&#13;
the Road Fund, the newly privatized road construction industry will have a market large enough to&#13;
ensure its viability over a continuous period of time. This is likely to result in higher wages and&#13;
employment of new workers. On the road users' side, improved access and reduction in vehicle&#13;
operating costs will facilitate trade and access to essential social services (schools, hospitals) and&#13;
markets, including those for agricultural products and small industry goods.  Furthermore, the&#13;
reduction in vehicle operating costs will have a direct impact on poverty by reducing the final cost of&#13;
products and of public transportation. While not a targetted poverty operation, this project should&#13;
contribute to lessening poverty in rural areas and overall, through its contribution to the increased&#13;
growth of the economy.&#13;
N. Participation&#13;
4.39. During project preparation, the World Bank missions consulted extensively with LRA,&#13;
Regional Road Administrations, road construction consultants and contractors, the Central Laboratory&#13;
and the various Ministries in discussions of the project components, the concept of total transport cost&#13;
for the society and of competitive bidding, and the requirements of a market-based economy. The&#13;
consultation was held at a central level rather than with local authorities since only maintenance of the&#13;
main road network is included in the project. Unlike new construction, periodic maintenance in Latvia&#13;
is not expected to cause significant shifts in traffic patterns. Therefore the choice of the appropriate&#13;
periodic maintenance and the sections to be maintained included in this project is guided mainly by&#13;
technical and economic considerations at a national level. There will, however, be some traffic&#13;
disruptions caused by the partial or complete closing of bridges during bridge repairs. In these cases,&#13;
the local authorities will be consulted in advance so that appropriate traffic diversion and other traffic&#13;
management requirements are introduced in order to minimize the impact on the local population and&#13;
the road users.&#13;

Project Benefits, Risks and Sustainability                                              26&#13;
V.     PROJECT BENEFITS, RISKS AND SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
5.1.   Periodic Maintenance Component.  The project would enable Latvia to expand periodic&#13;
maintenance during a three year period (1997-1999), thus extending the life of the highway system and&#13;
avoiding costly reconstruction and rehabilitation expenditures. The project would also improve road&#13;
conditions, thus reducing vehicle operating costs. This will reduce overall transport costs, making&#13;
Latvian industry more competitive and making Latvia more attractive for foreign investors.  An&#13;
additional project benefit would be the experience gained by local contractors in carrying out&#13;
maintenance work on a competitive basis and at higher quality standards.&#13;
5.2.   The project maintenance alternatives were determined through the use of the HDM III Model&#13;
(see Annex C) after a roughness survey of the entire Main Road Network. This model analyzed more&#13;
than 200 different sections of road and their characteristics, the level of traffic, the characteristics of the&#13;
vehicle fleet, and 5 different maintenance strategies for each of the sections. The model estimated for&#13;
each alternative and each section the evolution of the road condition, the total transport cost for users,&#13;
and the NPV and IRR. The most cost efficient alternatives were selected accordingly and were used as&#13;
a basis for prioritizing the sections to be rehabilitated.&#13;
5.3.   Bridge Repair and Reconstruction. The bridge component would focus on urgent repair or&#13;
reconstruction needs of Main Road bridges, since many bridges no longer have sufficient bearing&#13;
capacity after years of neglected maintenance. Part of the traffic would have to be diverted to longer&#13;
routes in the near future if no repair is undertaken, and these diversions would result in higher vehicle&#13;
operating costs for the users. The Latvian Road Administration has selected fifteen bridges in critical&#13;
condition and essential for the Latvian Road network. The remaining life span and the decrease in the&#13;
bearing capacity of these bridges have been assessed through a survey. The corresponding savings that&#13;
could be achieved by avoiding the diversion of traffic have been assessed and compared to the cost of&#13;
various repair alternatives deemed acceptable by a bridge specialist, and the most cost effective&#13;
alternatives were selected.&#13;
5.4.   Accident Black Spot Improvement. The Road Safety component would reduce the high&#13;
accident rate in Latvia through improvement of accident black spots, with a saving in human lives,&#13;
hospital costs, and vehicle repair costs. The activities have been selected on the basis of economic&#13;
analysis with priority given to low cost remedial measures. The impact of each selected remedial&#13;
measure on the number of accidents can be estimated as a coefficient of reduction in accidents. Because&#13;
of the absence of appropriate Latvian accident statistics, Finnish coefficients of reduction in the number&#13;
of accidents have been used to assess the IRR and NPV. This use is conservative in terms of expected&#13;
benefits because Finland dealt with its major accident black spots 10 years ago and the remedial&#13;
measures to accident black spots now have a limited impact compared to Latvia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

5.5.   Economic Benefits.   The results of the project economic analysis are as follows (see Annex&#13;

society lowered by 20 percent&#13;
5.6.   Shadow pricing. Most equipment and material included under the project are internationally&#13;
traded and world market prices have been used. The costs for Road Maintenance civil works,&#13;
including labor, were based on a weighted average of Scandinavian and Latvian prices, while the costs&#13;
of repair for bridges are international costs. The underlying assumption is that competitive bidding&#13;
would bring the presently high domestic prices closer to world market prices.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
5.7.   Project risks are considered as moderate because of the competence of the Latvian Road&#13;
Administration, the experience of its PIU in managing foreign-financed projects and the commitment of&#13;
the Lavian Governement as indicated by the establishment of a Road Fund to finance road maintenance&#13;
costs. The three principal risks the project will face are the following:&#13;

financing the repayment of the loan.         protects against adverse amendments in the Road&#13;
Fund)&#13;
3. Quality of the work: work implemented may  Foreign consultants will train the newly created&#13;
not meet contract requirements.              MUs during the first two years on supervision and&#13;
quality control issues. These services will be&#13;
extended to the third year if deemed necessary.&#13;
Contracts will require contractors to use field&#13;
laboratories.&#13;
C. Project Sustainability&#13;
5.8.   Financial Sustainability. The increase in the excise taxes on fuel that went into effect in 1996,&#13;
combined with the resources available from loans from the World Bank and other international&#13;
financial institutions, will provide the resources that LRA needs to reduce the maintenance backlog,&#13;
provide the funds needed for future maintenance as estimated by the COWI/BCEOM report (see para.&#13;
2.28), meet the repayment requirements of the foreign loans, and provide a limited amount of resources&#13;
for high return investments in the road sub-sector, as shown in Annex L. A more refined assessment of&#13;
the financing needs of the road sub-sector is now under way, as described in paras. 2.28 and 4.15. The&#13;
established Road Fund secures the financing of the road maintenance and assure that the project&#13;
objectives will be met. The establishment of a Road Fund is a commitment from the Government of&#13;
Latvia to provide LRA with constant funding.&#13;
5.9.   Overall Project Sustainability. The improvements in LRA's operations and in the private&#13;
construction companies resulting from the technical services and training included in the project, as&#13;
well as from the utilization of competitive bidding procedures for periodic maintenance, are likely to&#13;
have a lasting impact as these methods and techniques prove their efficiency. Also, the effect on road&#13;
safety of this project will likely be sustained since it complements the ongoing institution building by&#13;
introducing a methodology to treat accident black spots cost efficiently.&#13;

ANNEX C&#13;

LATVIA HIGHWAY PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    Background Information. The Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM&#13;
III) was used for most of the analysis. The HDM Model, created by the World Bank, has&#13;
been used all over the world to perform economic analysis on road maintenance and&#13;
design. This model requires as inputs the condition of the road (roughness, cracking,&#13;
potholing, ravelling, geometric parameters, history of the pavement), the level of traffic&#13;
and its estimated growth (broken down into five categories of vehicles), the cost of&#13;
vehicle maintenance, the cost of passenger time and cargo holding in case of congestion,&#13;
the depreciation of vehicles, and five different maintenance strategies and their impact on&#13;
road surface distress. The model calculates the road deterioration and the evolution of the&#13;
road roughness under traffic assumptions, and estimates the vehicle operating costs under&#13;
the various maintenance strategies. These vehicle operating costs are added to the Road&#13;
Agency Maintenance costs to assess the total economic cost for society of each strategy.&#13;
The model then compares the benefits of each strategy with a base strategy, usually a&#13;
simple routine maintenance, and determines the NPV and IRR for the various strategies&#13;
compared to the base strategy. This calculation leads to a prioritization of sections and&#13;
strategies. The discount rate selected to calculate the NPV of the project was 12 percent&#13;
and the period of analysis 20 years. The economic analysis was performed by various&#13;
consultants using various methodologies. A different approach based on the assessment&#13;
of the project by corridor could have been used, but the bridge economic analysis, based&#13;
on World Bank methodology, showed significantly higher IRR and NPV than other&#13;
components. Therefore, interpretation of the aggregated savings and costs by corridor&#13;
would have brought no real additional information.&#13;
2.    Highway Periodic Maintenance.  The analysis of the Highway Periodic&#13;
Maintenance component was performed with the HDM III (version 1995). Sample input&#13;
data is given in Page 6 to 10 of this Annex. The analysis was performed on the full Main&#13;
Road Network with already existing pavement data (geometry, surface and base&#13;
characteristics, strength, pavement condition, and history of pavement) collected during&#13;
annual LRA pavement surveys (see Para. 2.30.) and with new roughness measurements&#13;
performed by the Danish Road Directorate, which is assisting in setting up a Pavement&#13;
Management System. The calibration of the HDM model was influenced by a study&#13;
comparing the HDM pavement deterioration model to actual deterioration of the road&#13;
network in Ukraine, where the actual deterioration of various types of pavement has been&#13;
monitored for 25 years. Some conclusions can be drawn from Ukraine since the freezing&#13;
climate, the FSU detail design, and the quality of construction and materials are&#13;
considered similar with Latvia. Regarding freezing, the study found that deterioration&#13;
was significantly understated by the HDM model in case of weak pavements and&#13;
insignificantly overstated for strong pavements. Since Latvian pavements were assessed&#13;
as fairly strong (SNC&gt;3), no correction was made for this factor. Based on the study in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX C&#13;
Page 2 of 17&#13;
Ukraine, the ravelling, potholing and cracking factors were chosen equal to one. Traffic&#13;
volumes were based upon some existing traffing counts. Vehicle characteristics were&#13;
provided by LRA and the Danish Road Directorate. Unit costs for construction and&#13;
maintenance were based on prices of previous years with a reduction of 20 percent to&#13;
reflect the likely effect of better competition (unit prices are currently equivalent to two&#13;
times those of neighbouring countries). Five maintenance strategies were defined taking&#13;
into account the Latvian road network characteristics: (i) routine maintenance and&#13;
patching; (ii) patching and 12 mm surface dressing when surface deterioration exceeds 20&#13;
percent; (iii) 12 mm surface dressing on a levelling layer, followed by surface dressing&#13;
when surface deterioration exceeds 20 percent ; (iv) 4 cm overlay when roughness&#13;
exceeds 3 (IRI); and (v) 4 cm overlay when roughness exceeds 3.5 (IRI) plus/or 12 mm&#13;
surface dressing when surface deterioration exceeds 20 percent.&#13;
3.     Most of the time, the analysis selected the strategies (ii) or (iii) with IRRs&#13;
between 21 percent and 91.2 percent, giving an average weighted IRR of 34.9 percent&#13;
and an NPV of US$ 85.5 million for the US$ 27.0 million maintenance program included&#13;
in the project (see Table 2 Page 11-16 for the results). This result conforms with good&#13;
engineering knowledge, since traffic is limited and pavement strength is good, which&#13;
means that potential savings would come mainly from improvement in the roughness (i.e.&#13;
levelling) and prevention of further deterioration (i.e. surface dressing). The current&#13;
prioritization from the HDM model will be used mainly for the first year of the project.&#13;
Afterwards, the Belman pavement management system introduced by the Danish Road&#13;
Directorate is expected to be fully operational and provide more refined economic&#13;
analysis since its calibration to Latvian conditions took one full year.&#13;
4.    Sensitivity Analysis. Given the high levels of IRR and NPV, and the annual&#13;
review of the selected section and maintenance strategies that will be performed with the&#13;
Belman system, the sensitivity analysis has been performed on three representative road&#13;
sections A13012, Al km 0-4.5 and km 12-15. The impact of traffic growth and the cost&#13;
of periodic maintenance on the results of the economic analysis has been assessed in the&#13;
following situations: low traffic growth of 2 percent per year instead of 4 percent for the&#13;
base case and higher costs of twenty percent compared to the base case. Table 1&#13;
summarizes the effects on the three selected road sections in the worst case scenario&#13;
(higher costs and low traffic growth). Extrapolation of these results for the entire&#13;
repaving prograrn would decrease the IRR from 34.9 to a still acceptable 28 percent and&#13;
the NPV from US$ 85.5 million to US$ 55 million. Given that the IRR of most road&#13;
sections evaluated is well above 20 percent (see Table 2 Page 11-16), sensitivity of&#13;
results with respect to the discount rate was not undertaken.&#13;

5.    Bridges. Twenty bridges were selected among the 50 considered in critical&#13;
condition, for detailed investigations.  Repair and reconstruction strategies were&#13;
compared to the do nothing situation. The remaining life and the decrease in bearing&#13;
capacity of these bridges have been assessed through a survey. This has been used to&#13;
estimate the date(s) when part of the traffic such as heavy vehicles or the total traffic&#13;
should be diverted to alternative routes as weight restrictions start being applied for safety&#13;
reasons if no repair is carried out. The diverted traffic would have to use longer&#13;
alternative routes in often worse road conditions than the initial route. That would result&#13;
in additional vehicle operating costs. The alternative routes have been determined with&#13;
the assistance of LRA and the vehicle operating costs per kilometer have been estimated&#13;
with HDM III. The savings for the repair and reconstruction strategies come from the&#13;
absence of diversion while the additional costs come from the cost of repair or&#13;
reconstruction.&#13;
6.    It was assumed that all traffic subject to load restriction would divert to the&#13;
alternative route. Although traffic that would actually divert would be somewhat less&#13;
because of the increased cost of the travel over the longer route, no data were available&#13;
for estimating either the traffic reduction (i.e. the cost elasticity of trips), or the economic&#13;
cost of the loss of economic activity resulting from the reduction. Given the very high&#13;
levels of IRR and NPV and the cost of getting such data, no such refinements were&#13;
carried out. Table 3 (Page 17) puts the diversion costs in perspective by showing the&#13;
percentage increase in trip costs associated with diversion, bearing in mind that the&#13;
proportionate increase in the cost of a trip is in relation to the entire length of the&#13;
traveler's journey rather than in relation to the percentage increase in the trip costs&#13;
associated with the diversion. The results are given in this Annex on page 17. A&#13;
sensitivity analysis on traffic growth (2 and 4 percent) and cost of construction (100 and&#13;
120 percent ) was performed and showed that in the case of low traffic growth and high&#13;
cost of repair or reconstruction, the Net Present Value would decrease from US$ 525&#13;
million to US$ 432 million. The fifteen bridges with the highest NPV and IRR have been&#13;
selected to be financed under the project, but the sequence of the repair will be made on&#13;
the basis of when load reductions will be required.&#13;

7.    Road Safety. The benefits achieved through the road safety component are&#13;
assessed in five steps:&#13;
(i) compare the accident data for an accident black spot to the data obtained for a&#13;
similar road segment (ie crossing, exit lane, etc);&#13;
(ii) estimate the future accident rate by considering traffic growth and other&#13;
parameters.&#13;
(iii) predict the rate of accident to be achieved.&#13;
(iv) decide the specific activities necessary to remedy to the accident black spots&#13;
and determine the impact of each activity based on experience and on existing&#13;
Finnish table showing coefficient of reduction in accidents in specific situation.&#13;
(v) determine the cost-optimal activity.&#13;
8.    The adopted "value of statistical life" has been estimated at US$ 240,000, the&#13;
equivalent of one twentieth of the American one. This value is based on the DEC note&#13;
No7, April 1996, that stated that the value of a statistical life in the United States was in&#13;
the range of US$ 1.2 to 10.7 million. The value selected for Latvia represents an estimate&#13;
based on the difference of income in the two countries. The average cost of injury has&#13;
been assessed at US$ 12,000 per accident with injured.&#13;
9.    The Finnish coefficients of accident reduction associated with selected safety&#13;
measures have been applied since no five year series of data were available in Latvia.&#13;
These coefficients come from the 1995 "Publication #65 from Finnish Road&#13;
Administration: Assessment of Traffic Safety Impacts using Coefficients". Following&#13;
are some of the coefficients of reduction in accident used to perform the analysis. A&#13;
coefficient of 0.6 means that the accidents will be reduced by 40 percent.  The&#13;
coefficients indicate reduction of accidents causing injuries. In some cases, the reduction&#13;
rate of accidents causing fatalities will be greater (ref. speed limits in urban areas).&#13;

10.   The US$ 6.0 million program included under the project is expected to reduce the&#13;
number of fatalities by 8 per year and the number of accidents with injuries by 49 per&#13;
year. The expected annual benefits were evaluated at US$ 2.5 million after 1999 while&#13;
the costs were spread over three years with US$ 1.0 million the first year, US$ 4.0&#13;
million the second year and US$ 1.1 million the third year. The expected NPV would be&#13;
US$ 10.2 million and the IRR 65 percent. A sensitivity analysis with a statistical cost of&#13;
fatalities and of injury decreased by 20 percent and an annual reduction of only 6&#13;
fatalities and 39 accidents with injuries would still give an NPV of US$ 4.8 million and&#13;
an IRR of 34 percent.&#13;

            Latvia - Highway Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of the Highway
            Project will be to preserve the Latvian road network and
            minimize total road transport costs. The specific objectives
            of the project are to: a) expand the periodic maintenance
            level where economically justified; b) improve road
            maintenance efficiency and quality by introducing improved
            technology and quality control and increasing the Latvian
            Road Administration's cost consciousness and economic
            justification capabilities; c) support the development of
            private road construction and engineering industries; d)
            improve road safety conditions; and e) establish the funding
            mechanism and level required to achieve minimum total road
            transport cost. The main components of the project are: a)
            periodic road maintenance; b) bridge repair and
            reconstruction; c) road safety improvement; d) gravel road
            maintenance and low cost bitumenization techniques; e)
            equipment for the central laboratory; and f) institutional strengthening.
