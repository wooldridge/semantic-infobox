The issue aodressed in this paper is: on the basis of the labor market results&#13;
of :Lts graduates, should senior secondary education in Indonesia be expanded? And,&#13;
if so, is it the academic or specialized schools that should grow mo3t rapidly?  hlbe&#13;
Natb.ona. Labor Force Surveys (SAKERNAS) present a paradoxical picture about senior&#13;
secoxndary education: its greaduates earn substantially more but also have higher&#13;
unenployment rates than do those with less education. TIhe higher earnings, if enough&#13;
to (mxmpenSate for the costs of education, point toward expansion; the unemplcyment,&#13;
howe-ver, may indicate an oversupply, evidence against expansion.&#13;
The main source of data is a tracer study for a cohort of senior secondary&#13;
school graduates covering the first two years after finishing school. fThe analysis&#13;
indLcates that the seemingly high unemplcyment rates as reported in SAKERNAS are not&#13;
evidlence or an oversupply of such graduates.  Indonesian unemployment is mainly of&#13;
persons who are in the midst of a long spell of unemployment, most oE wham are young&#13;
peri;ons who are in the process of going fran school to work like those described in&#13;
the tracer study. TIhe process of moving fran school to work can be a lengthy one for&#13;
marrr young persons. Some are slow to enter the labor market; they w3nt to continue&#13;
the.Lr eaucation, or take courses, or be at home. Many at first do very little to&#13;
findi work when they do want a job. Sane are willing to take low paid work but many&#13;
wani: only reasonably paid work, and are willing to wait for such a job. And the&#13;
labor market operates slowly,, even for those who have a clear idea of the job they&#13;
wani: and how to get that job., TIhus, young people are absorbed into the labor market&#13;
and into jobs very slowly ancd this situation generates the high unemployment rates.&#13;
'The evidence is that virtually all senior secondary graduates who want work are&#13;
evenitually absorbed into jobs;, at pay rates that are substantially higher than among&#13;
tha3e with lesser amounts ot education, Even with a long wait for graduates to get&#13;
joba3, senior secondary education is a good investment and warrants expansion. The&#13;
data in this paper also indicate that, overall, the academic senior secondary schools&#13;
(MSt) are the best investment: but there are probably local situations where one or&#13;
more or the specialized secoxdary schools deserve an even higher priority.&#13;

I. THME ISSUE&#13;
The primary issue addressed in this paper is whether senior secondary education&#13;
should be expanded in Indonevsia. The analysis is based largely on data from a&#13;
nationwide tracer study conducted by the Ministry of Education which followed a&#13;
cohort of primary, lower secondary and upper secondary school leavers for two years&#13;
after graduation in 1976.1 'rhe schooling, training, and job experiences of this&#13;
cohort are used to measure booth the overall effectiveness of senior secondary&#13;
education as well as the relative effectiveness of different types of schools at the&#13;
senior secondary level. An important byproduct of the tracer study has been a better&#13;
understanding of the process by which new graduates in Indonesia, Earticularly those&#13;
from senior high school move from school to work.&#13;
&amp;mnior Secondary Education in Indonesia&#13;
Indonesia has a relatively low enrollment rate at the senior secondary level in&#13;
ccmparison with other countries at comparable levels of develoFment:. The senior&#13;
secondary schools that now exist include not only academic schools but also a wide&#13;
variety of specialized or vocational schools. Indeed, Indonesia places more emiphasis&#13;
or vocational and technical education than do most other countries, particularly the&#13;
less developed countries. (See Appendix 1 for data about the relat:ive importance of&#13;
srecialized education at the secondary level in Indonesia.) Senioir secondary schools&#13;
urlder the Ministry of Education are general or academic (SMA), coxrnercial (SMEA),&#13;
technical (STIM), home economics (SKKA), and primary school teacher training (SPG).&#13;
lbe study was conducted by the Office of Educational and Cultural Research and&#13;
Developnent, Department of Education and Culture, Jakarta. Projecl: Director was C.&#13;
M. Widodo; staff included D. Soedarminto, Konta Damanik and Hadjir Haroeni;&#13;
consultants were Ruth Daroesman, Australian National University,, and David H. Clark,&#13;
University of Maine, USA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
The academic school (SMA) has traditionally been a route to further higher&#13;
education and its curriculum concentrates on academic subjects with little or no time&#13;
devoted to practical skills (Beeby). The specialized schools, on the other hand, are&#13;
supposed to be terminal institutions, thereby relieving some of the pressure on the&#13;
demand for further education while providing a secondary education as well as job&#13;
skills that will help in modernizing the economy.&#13;
There are also schools under other ministries. A very small percentage of the&#13;
latter are specialized schools providing training in agriculture, forestry, and&#13;
pharmacy, while the largest number are schools under the Department of Religion&#13;
(Beeby). This study examines only the effectiveness of those schools under the&#13;
Ministry of Education.&#13;
Labor Market Perforance of Secondary School Graduates&#13;
The national labor force sample surveys (SAKERNAS) present a&#13;
paradoxical picture of the labor market performanoe of persons with senior secondary&#13;
education. On one hand, there is a substantial amount of unemployment in Indonesia&#13;
and the highest rates are found among senior secondary graduates. On the other&#13;
hand, those senior high school graduates who have jobs are earning much more than&#13;
persons with lesser amounts of education.&#13;
Unemploymet, Open unemployment in urban Indonesia at the time of the last&#13;
SAKERNAS study stood at 6%. An analysis of the SAKERNAS data (details are in&#13;
Appendix 2) shows that those who were openly unemployed in urban areas had these&#13;
characteristics:&#13;
(a) Most were young persons (persons under 25 made up 28% of the&#13;
total labor force and 73% of the unemployed; 87% of all&#13;
unemployed were under the age of 30).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
(b) Most had never worked (the proportion of the unemployed wlho&#13;
had ever held a job rises with age but even among those&#13;
20-24 only 32% had previous job experience).&#13;
(c) Many were experiencing a long spell of unemployment (a crude&#13;
stock-and-flow analysis indicates that more than 60% of the&#13;
unemployment during 1978 was accounted for by individuals&#13;
who had a spell of unemployment lasting eight months or&#13;
more).&#13;
Among those young peop]e who were in the urban labor force, the highest rates of&#13;
unemployment are found among senior secondary school graduates and the rates are&#13;
seemingly very high indeed. As shown inTable 1, which contains unemployment rates by&#13;
age, education, and sex, the overall unemploymnent rate for persons in urban areas&#13;
aged 20-24 was 16%; male secondary school graduates in that same age group had an&#13;
unmmployment rate of 30%.&#13;
Earninas of exrloyed garaduates. In contrast to the disquietingly high&#13;
unmmployment rates, the earnings performance of senior secondary graduates is&#13;
impressive. As shown in Table 2, mean earnings for urban males who had completed&#13;
senior secondary education are almost twice the earnings for those with just a&#13;
primary education. Also, the proportion in a job paying a wage that puts the worker&#13;
in the higher paid sector (arbitrarily set at either Rp 20,000 or Rp 30,000) is a&#13;
great deal higher among sen:ior secondary graduates than among those with only a&#13;
primary education.&#13;
These data frmn SAKERNAS are used later in this paper to calculate a rate of&#13;
return to upper secondary education. The conclusion is that the earnings differenices&#13;
sunnarized in Table 2 are nvre than enough to compensate for the time and resource&#13;
co3ts of six years of secondary education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
More evidence of the paradox. An experimental study of labor utilization in&#13;
three urban areas of Java, the kotamadya of Bandung, Surakarta, and Pasuruan, was&#13;
conductd by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in 1976. Random&#13;
samples were taken in each area. Strictly speaking, the data can only be used to&#13;
describe the situation in these three kotamadva but, as the authors say, the data&#13;
probably do provide some indication of the situation in urban Java.&#13;

The definitions of utilization were those first suggested by Hauser. The labor&#13;
force, defined as those either working or actively looking for a job, was categorized&#13;
into various groups according to their degree of utilization.  The first group were&#13;
those unemplcyed. The next group were those who were working but were inadequately&#13;
utilized because they worked fewer hours than the "normal" work week. The third&#13;
group were that part of the remainder who were inadequately utilized because they&#13;
were earning an income insufficient to support one individual. The fourth group were&#13;
those who were working but earning an insufficient income to support a family. The&#13;
final group, a residual, were all those who were not categorized as inadequately&#13;
utilized for one of the reasons listed above and were classified as being adequately&#13;
utilized. Among the entire group of men in urban areas, about 6% were unemployed but&#13;
few of the remainder had good jobs; only 16% of those in the labor force were&#13;
"adequately utilized." The men who were secondary school graduates showed the same&#13;
paradoxical results as described above the entire country: among all educational&#13;
groups, those with a senior secondary education had the highest rate of unemployment,&#13;
10%, and the highest proportion, 33%, who were adequately utilized (Redmana, gt al.).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Mie Issues a Restatement&#13;
A primary purpose of this paper is to investigate the issue olE whether the&#13;
senior secondary school system should be expanded. The small number of secondary&#13;
schools relative to the size of the country and the substantially Ixtter labor market&#13;
results of graduates, once they do get work, point to expansion. on the other hand,&#13;
the high rate of unemployrcnt cited above could be interpreted as evidence of an&#13;
oirersupply of secondary school graduates. An argument could be made that such&#13;
schools, or at least those types of secondary schools whose graduates cannot get&#13;
work, should not be expanded and indeed consideration should be given to their&#13;
c)ntraction. Since almost all of the unemployment is among young ipersons who have&#13;
nevver worked and are in the! midst of a long spell of joblessness, a tracer study such&#13;
as the one analyzed in this paper which follows fresh graduates as they leave school&#13;
a&amp;d begin to enter the labor market, should give insights into the meaning of these&#13;
high rates of unemployment. Therefore, one set of issues investigated in this paper&#13;
i; about not only the extenit of joblessness among secondary school graduates but also&#13;
thie nature of that joblessness.&#13;
A second area of concern is about the relative success of different types of&#13;
sioecialized forms of secondlary education. There are two objectives for specialized&#13;
elucation: (1) to provide terminal secondary education (thus relieving some of the&#13;
peessure on demand for higher education); and, (2) to provide job skills for the&#13;
econarry. Specifically, then, the tracer study has investigated these questions:&#13;
(a) Are the specialized forms of senior secondary education&#13;
acting as terminal forms of education, or are the same&#13;
proportion of graduates going on to further education&#13;
as is the case amnong the academic schools?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
(b) Are graduates with a particular type of specialized&#13;
education doing any better in the job market than&#13;
graduates of other types of school or those from the&#13;
academic stream?&#13;
A final concern is the general issue of unemployment in Indonesia. Most&#13;
unemployment in Indonesia is among young people and consists mainly of first timers&#13;
in the labor market. By examining longitudinal information on how young people go&#13;
fran school to work we can get a better understanding of the meaning of this&#13;
situation.&#13;
II. THE IRACER STUDY&#13;
The tracer study surveyed, over a two year period, a cohort of students and&#13;
former students from a representative sample of 160 schools in eight provinoes&#13;
including nine different types of primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary&#13;
schools. The cohort was chosen in the following manner: all students in their last&#13;
year in the sample schools were identified in 1976 and their names and addresses were&#13;
obtained just prior to graduation. The following year each person was contacted by&#13;
post card to ascertain whether or not he or she had continued in school. The cohort&#13;
chosen for personal interviews included all those no longer in school except for&#13;
female school leavers who declared themselves inactive and a sample of those who were&#13;
continuing full-time education. An attempt was made to interview each member of the&#13;
cohort in November 1977 and again in September 1978. Attrition from the cohort was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
groater among those who did not continue their education but the stuldy was able to&#13;
keep in contact with a surprisingly large portion: 89% in 1977 and 66% in&#13;
19',8.1&#13;
This paper considers orly the data about senior secondary schools. Graduates&#13;
wer:e interviewed (in the saue proportions as are found in the country generally) from&#13;
fivre different types of upper secondary schools: academic (SMh), technical (STM),&#13;
e)xnomic (SMEA), hcme economsics (SKKA), and primary school teacher training (SPG).&#13;
Sane of the characteristics of the persons interviewed are contained in Table 3.&#13;
Overall results in 1978 for the individuals surveyed in the tracer study are&#13;
catained in Table 4. The first column contains the total number of graduates for&#13;
the nation as of 1976 so the reader can gain some idea of the relative size of the&#13;
diEferent types of secondary schools. The proportions who did and did not continue&#13;
'Attrition was greater among (a) those who were no longer in school; (b) STM&#13;
graduates; (c) men; and, (d) migrants who moved out of the areas whtere interview&#13;
teams were located (some of the latter were followed up by mail or by contacting&#13;
relatives). Continuation rates in Tables 4 and 5 have been adjusted for attrition.&#13;
Aa for the out of school portion of the cohort, our best information is that those&#13;
interviewed represent all mmnbers of the cohort. While some proportions would vary&#13;
if full information were available (attrition has probably meant that rates of&#13;
joblessness reported herein are higher than if full information were available), the&#13;
general thrust of the argument remains valid.&#13;

Continuation Rates.&#13;
mhis section reports on the proportions of graduates who did and did not&#13;
continue full-time education. The main issue about continuation rates is the large,&#13;
and to some extent, unmet demand for higher education in Indonesia. One reason for&#13;
specialized or vocational education is to provide terminal education which supplies&#13;
not only secondary education but also the opportunity to learn job skills that are&#13;
imnediately useful. However, if students treat secondary vocational education as&#13;
just one more possible route toward higher education, one of the purposes for the&#13;
education is thwarted and the vocational part of the education may be to some extent&#13;
a waste of resources.&#13;
The proportions of senior secondary graduates who were still in school one and&#13;
two years after the initial interview (what is termed 'continuation rate") are shown&#13;
in Table 5. There were substantial&#13;

differences in continuation rates between the different types of secondary education.&#13;
In 1978, well over half of the SME graduates were continuing their education and,&#13;
with the exception of SKKA, the rates for the specialized forms of education were&#13;
significantly less. Cearly, the specialized schools (except SKEKA) are more likely&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
to provide terminal educxLtion than is SMA,. The continuation rate rose between 1977&#13;
ind 1978 for most schoolsj that is, a larger part of the cohort was back in school in&#13;
1.978 than in 1977.&#13;
'The probability that an individual secondary school graduate will continue his&#13;
or her education may depend on many factors. There is always the possibility that&#13;
clifferences in continuaticn rates between schools are the results of the&#13;
characteristics of student.s and their location, not the schools thenselves. To test&#13;
this possibility, a logit analysis was run using a dummy (0, 1) dependent variable&#13;
identifying whether the member of the cohort was or was not in school in 1978, with&#13;
independent variables signifying age, location and type of school. The null&#13;
kpothesis was: after controlling for age and sex of students and location of&#13;
E;chool, there are no differences betweeen continuation rates of graduates frcn SMA@&#13;
end the specialized schools that canmot be explained by chance. Ccmnplete results are&#13;
in the Appendix and are summarized in Table 6. The results show the effects of age,&#13;
Eex, type of school, language spoken at home, and location of school on the&#13;
pirobability that a senior secondary school graduate would continue his or her&#13;
education.&#13;
The 'marginal' effect of a particular independent variable is the increase or&#13;
decrease in probability compared to the result had the entire grouping of variables&#13;
not been considered. For example, the marginal effect of SMk education was estimated&#13;
to be a .12 increase in probability. Camparisons were made using a modal graduate, a&#13;
Ferson classified according to the individual characteristics most: often occurring in&#13;
the cohort. The modal grouping for Table 6, the entire senior secondary school&#13;
cohort that graduated in 1976, was an SMR graduate, male, who spoke a regional&#13;
language, lived outside Java, and was' 20 or 21 years old when he graduated; the&#13;
jrobability that this modal person would continue his education was .38. If the type&#13;
of school had not been considered at all, the probability was calculated at .261&#13;
hence the marginal effect of SMk education was .12, the entry shcn in Table 6.&#13;

,'he results indicate that older graduates had a lower probability and younger&#13;
graduates a higher probability than did graduates of the normal or median age level;&#13;
rien had a higher probability than wcnen; and graduates who spoke only a regional&#13;
:Language at hcne had a lower probability as conpared to those who spoke&#13;
Ighasa Indonesia. Locaticn of school had an appreciable effect ao the probability of&#13;
continuing but once the ot-her variables were in the equation location was no longer&#13;
significant.&#13;
As for the effects of school, the null hypothesis was rejected: after&#13;
o3ontrolling for the other variables that influenoe whether an individual continues&#13;
hiis education, graduates f ran the specialized schools (except for SKKA) still had&#13;
significantly lower probabilities of going on to further education. Controlling for&#13;
lhe other characteristics that are associated with higher and lowier probabilities&#13;
(age, language, etc.) did, however, reduce the measured inpact of school type on&#13;
' ontinuation rates. For example, the raw figures in Table 5 indicate that 65% of SM@&#13;
and 28% of SIM graduates wient on to further education, a difference of 37 percentage&#13;
?ooints. Once one control]led for the fact that the SM1 graduates in the cohort had&#13;
quite different characteriLstics than did STM graduates, the difference in the&#13;
?robability of continuing on with further education was reduoed to a figure in the&#13;
range of 9 to 20 percentage points, depending on student characteristics. The&#13;
difference in probabilities between SMW and SMEA graduates was reduced fran 22 points&#13;
to a figure with a range of 9 to 20 points. See Appendix for further details.&#13;
nlusions about Cbntition RategL&#13;
Information on oontinuation rates during the first year after school is finished&#13;
gives an incauplete picture about how many students oontinue their education. For&#13;
nost of the schools in our study, the proportion of graduates who were continuing&#13;
their education was significantly higher at the time of the second interview than it&#13;
,was for the first.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
Graduates fran the specialized forms of senior secondary education, SMEA, SMO,&#13;
SKAA, and SPG, were much less likely to continue their education than were graduates&#13;
frm SMA. This finding was confirmed by multivariate analysis. The probability that&#13;
an SMA graduate would continue in full-time formal education remained higher than&#13;
that found among graduates of specialized education after controlling for sex and age&#13;
of the student and location of the school.&#13;
While it is true that, as a rule, a specialized secondary school is more likely&#13;
to provide terminal education than is an SMA school, it should be pointed out that&#13;
there are many exceptions to that rule. A majority of SMA graduates do go on to&#13;
further education but far fram all graduates do so; indeed, more than one-third of&#13;
the SMA graduates studied did not oontinue their education and most of them went into&#13;
the labor force. This finding deserves wide dissemination in the schools as part of&#13;
a concerted effort to help more SMA graduates adjust their expectations to the real&#13;
opportunities which do exist for them in the labor market if they are willing to take&#13;
steps to find work instead of continuing their education. The finding suggests there&#13;
is a need to send more empirical information on the labor market into the schools&#13;
through a career guidance program.&#13;
By the same token, it is far from certain that STK and SMEA (and to a lesser&#13;
extent SPG) graduates will cease their education after graduation. A majority of&#13;
SMIEA, STM, and SPG graduates do stop formal education after graduating, but far from&#13;
all do; more than one-quarter of STM and SMEA graduates and more than one-tenth of&#13;
SPG graduates went on to further full-time education. The possibility that those&#13;
students who go to specialized schools want to and will continue their studies should&#13;
not be ignored in the syllabi for these schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

III. TffE OUTL-OPSCHOCL uuHQRT&#13;
Post-schooling experiences of the out-of-school members of the cohort were&#13;
obtained in interviews in both 1977 and 1978. Separate analyses are made of those&#13;
who did and did not go to SPr, the Primary school teacher training institution, since&#13;
the SPG graduates faced a very special labor market situation. In the initial&#13;
interview of the tracer study, each out-of-school respondent was first asked whether&#13;
he (or she) had worked scmetime during the previous week. An attenTt was made to&#13;
define  work" quite broadly to include not only what the graduate might consider a&#13;
regular job but also any activity for which he received pay or profit, or any work in&#13;
a fnmily business that operalted for pay or profit.1 (Indeed, the interviewers&#13;
were instructed to restart the interview and ask about the job if a person who was&#13;
initially identified a "not working was, through subsequent questions discovered to&#13;
actually have been working w:Lthin this definition.) Those who were not working were&#13;
then asked if they were look.Lng for a job or wanted work (&#13;
f  &amp;kah saudara sedana mencari RekerJaa. atau Min bekerjl a?      ). After a series of&#13;
oth r questions, the intervievw was ended with the questions about the respondent's&#13;
actilvities on a month-by-month basis over the previous year since leaving school.&#13;
Be, or she, was shown a blan); calendar and asked to indicate months when he was&#13;
worlcing (bekeria .. looking for work (rmrrnci iaekeriaan) or taking courses&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
For ease of interviewing, the question order was reversed in the second&#13;
interview. fhe respondent was first asked about the "calendar": since the last&#13;
interview what months had he been working (bekeria) , looking for work (mencari&#13;
Rekeriaan) , etc. fhen the interviewer took the last response and said, for example,&#13;
"are you still working?" and thus began the part of the interview asking about&#13;
details of jobs and job seeking activities during the week prior to the interview.&#13;
If the person described himself as not working but looking for work, he was asked,&#13;
among other things, what he had done to look for work in the previous month. Those&#13;
who had made some effort to find work during that period were identified as being&#13;
"unemployedw (questions to identify the "unemployed" were inadvertently left off of&#13;
the first interview).&#13;
The figures in Table 7 summarize the answers to those questions about labor&#13;
market activities during the period immediately prior to the time of the two&#13;
interviews. The figures show that, except for SEG graduates, the level of&#13;
joblessness among the out-of-school cohort was high. kmong the group that included&#13;
SM&amp;, SMEA, STM and SKKA graduates, only a minority of those wanting work had a job at&#13;
the time of the first interview. There was improvement during the second year.&#13;
Nevertheless, almost two years after leaving school, less than 60% of those who&#13;
wanted work actually had a job; indeed, the unemployment rate for this group ( a&#13;
figure coumparable to the SAKERNaS unemployment rates cited above) was 38%.1&#13;
'The figures largely refer to the same individuals although, as described&#13;
previously, there was some change in school status between the two periods: some of&#13;
those who were out of school in 1977 and included in the first colunn were in school&#13;
in 1978 and excluded from the 1978 data and vice versa. Also, there were some&#13;
changes in labor force status among the large majority who were out of school both&#13;
years. In particular, the 8% of the group each year who were designated as being&#13;
"inactive" are, to a large extent, different individuals. The reader may recall that&#13;
out-of-school wamen who declared themselves as inactive at the time of the first&#13;
interview were not interviewed and are not included in the cohort. It was thought&#13;
that a labor market study of graduates should not include women who wanted to be&#13;
hawemakers and had no interest in paid work. Estimates about rates of change in&#13;
labor force status among individuals are found below in Table 9.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
One important observation can be made based on the experience of SPG graduates.&#13;
hi shown in Table 7, SP  graduates were those most quickly absorbed into work, no&#13;
Ioubt because of the shortage of teachers due to the rapid expansioan of primary&#13;
schools. Even with this Ehortage however, it was not until the second interview that&#13;
aHLl reported as having work. This would seem to indicate the general difficulty of&#13;
formal job entry for young people even when demand exists and the career is clearly&#13;
uiwrked.&#13;
giat is "Wanting Work"?&#13;
Those persons who were not working but looking for or wanting work were asked&#13;
what they had done to get a job: whether they had answered newspaper advertisements,&#13;

called on firms, asked friends and neighbors, etc.   The answers are summarized in&#13;
Table 8. There was, apparently, great variation in the amount of activity ammig&#13;
those who said they wanted work. In the first year a sizeable number (16%) had done&#13;
nothing to find a job ard another larger group (43%) had made usome search" but not&#13;
enough to be categorizel as having made an "extensive search'. By the end of the&#13;
second year, among a anller number of individuals, more had dane something to look&#13;
for work but almost hali of those who were not working but looking for work had made&#13;
what seems to be only a limited search for a job.&#13;

It is not clear where to draw the line between those who should and should not&#13;
be included in the labor force. The questions about what persons had done to look&#13;
for work may impose standards about job search that are inappropriate for some&#13;
situations in Indonesia. When asked the same questions about what they had done to&#13;
look for work, more than cre-quarter of those with a job in 1977 replied that they&#13;
had done nothing to look for that job. Doing nothing may be a reasonable way to get&#13;
a job. Perhaps the most that can be said is that the description of actions to get a&#13;
job, just like the results about how many persons have jobs, indicates a slow but&#13;
steady absorption into more and more labor market activities among those who have not&#13;
yet gotten their first job.&#13;
Abso_tion as Measured by the Calendar Ouestions.&#13;
The slow but steady absorption into work and into the labor force is perhaps&#13;
best illustrated by the results of the calendar questions. Thiese questions were&#13;
necessarily less precise about labor force activity, simply asking individuals when&#13;
they were working, looking for work, etc., without going into what the individual (or&#13;
the interviewer) neant by these terms. Figure 1 tracks the reported activities for&#13;
those members of the cohort from senior seoondary schools excluding SPG, who were&#13;
identified as either working or looking for work at the time of the second interview.&#13;
At the very beginning, most cohort members were neither working nor looking for work.&#13;
(Those 5not in the labor force" were at hcme, in school, or taking courses; the&#13;
decline in the number outside the labor force came mostly because there were fewer&#13;
persons at hcne.) It was seven months after school was over until a third of the&#13;
cohort had jobs, and 12 months until at least half had work.&#13;
Flows of labor!  the mechanics of iobs and joblessness.  As shown in Figure 1,&#13;
a fairly constant proportion of the cohort were looking for work throughout the&#13;
twenty-one months and a steadily increasing proportion found work. The individuals&#13;
who made up these various labor force groups, however, were changing. The monthly&#13;

at the time of the two interviews, are estimates of stocks at various points in time;&#13;
those stocks are the net results of gross flows over time, flows into and out of the&#13;
labor force, into and out of jobs, and into and out of being without a job.&#13;
11he amount of unemployment, in any country, depends upon the flows into and out&#13;
of unemployment. Or, to put it another way: the amount of unemployment depends upon&#13;
the number of spells of unemployment (the flow into) and the duration of these&#13;
spells. The same rate of unemplcyment oDuld oome from many spells of a short&#13;
duration or, alternatively, fewer spells of a longer duration.&#13;
Table 9 contains estimates of the month-to-month changes in labor force status&#13;
that took place among the out-of-school cohort over the entire period covered by the&#13;
tracer study. The data are fran the "calendar question," and entries in the table&#13;
indicate the average change over the entire 21-mnth period. (See Marston for a&#13;
similar analysis for the US, using a different source of data.) Over the course of&#13;
that period (first row), 97% of the persons working in one month were, on the&#13;
average, working the following month while 3% were out of work; 2% were no longer&#13;
working but were looking for work, and 1% had left the labor force. Among those each&#13;
momth who were not working but looking for work (second row)), 5% had found jobs the&#13;
following month, 92% were still looking for work, and 3% had stopped looking. Among&#13;
those who were inactive in one mmnth (third row), 3% were working during the&#13;
subseqyent month, 9% were looking for work, and 88% were still inactive.&#13;

A striking feature of the figures in Table 9 is the small size of the&#13;
ma*h,-to-month change; the lack of change helps one understand the mechanics of jobs&#13;
ani joblessness in Indonesia.   First, although there is a definite trend toward&#13;
ab3orption into work shown earlier in Figure 1, the rate of absorption is quite&#13;
slim.  Ahen young people go from inactive status into the labor force, only one out&#13;
of four go directly into jobs; the remainder begin looking for work.   If a young&#13;
person is looking for work in one month there is only one chance out of twenty he or&#13;
she will be employed the following month. This means that the average duration for a&#13;
spell of looking for work is over 12 months (and 40% of those spells are terminated&#13;
when the individuahLs give u) looking for a job). The slow absorption also accounts&#13;
foi: the fact that 21 months after leaving school, 40% of the oDhort have yet: to find&#13;
their first job. Second, finding an initial job does not mean the person will remain&#13;
employed. Three percent of those working in cm month are no longer working the&#13;
foOllowing month: tw6-thirdci look for work and the remainder leave the labor force.&#13;
Over the course of a year, cver one-third of those in jobs change their labor force&#13;
status and the person who loses his job is faced with a spell of looking for work&#13;
which, on the average, lastEs for more than twelve months.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
As a result of the slow aborption and low turnover, there was great variation in&#13;
the total work experience among members of the cohort over the two-year period.&#13;
Table 10 contains the total number of months each respondent worked after leaving&#13;
school. About one-fifth of the cohort had worked at least 14 months in that period&#13;
between school and the time they had been interviewed; one-third had not worked at&#13;
all and another one-sixth had worked less than six months.&#13;

X ier Activities&#13;
Working or looking for work are not all of the possible activities for a fresh&#13;
grakduate who wants a good job. Other activities included trying to continue&#13;
fuLl-time education and taking short courses.&#13;
Secondary education in Indonesia is traditionally an avenue to higher education.&#13;
Probably many graduates see further education as an important optian they should&#13;
consider or investigate. Certainly many of the cohort tried to continue their&#13;
edication. Over one-quarter of those who were not in school at the time of the&#13;
second interview had tried to enter school during their first year after leaving&#13;
secondary school. These persons were not necessarily counted as inactive but they&#13;
did carry out other acitivities besides working or looking for work that were likely&#13;
to have delayed serious entry to the labor force.&#13;
Continuation of full-time formal education as described in an earlier section of&#13;
this paper is not a complete! picture of the further education of the young people&#13;
described in this report. Many of those who did not go on to further full-time&#13;
eduLcation did take additional courses. Overall, about 40% of the out-of-school&#13;
griLduates had taken oourses sometime during the two-year period for which data were&#13;
co]lected. There were substantial proportions from all types of sclools; the highest&#13;
prcportion was found among SMA (academic) graduates. Almost all of the courses had&#13;
becn taken at the iniative of the graduate and paid for by either the graduate or his&#13;
or her family; only a few were taken at the request of an emplcyer or paid for by an&#13;
emu Loyer.&#13;
There is, of course, a cause and effect problem here: it couLd well be that a&#13;
peroeption of poor job prospects led people to further education of some sort. The&#13;
point is that there are more choices open to a fresh graduate than working or looking&#13;
for work and these other activities can delay serious entry to the labor market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
Were craduates rp   red for Work?&#13;
There are hints from the tracer study that some graduates were not prepared for&#13;
the labor market, or at least did not think they were. First of all, there are the&#13;
large numbers who took additional courses.  Second, a large number of gradutes, from&#13;
all types of schools, said they did not think they had gotten useful job skills from&#13;
school.1  (See Table 11)  This was reported one year after leaving school and&#13;
the statement may well have been influenced by the respondent's labor market&#13;
experience. It is, perhaps, expected but unfortunate that most SM1 graduates felt&#13;
they had not obtained useful skills; it is surprising that at&#13;

1Each member of the cohort was asked "Do you think you got any special skills&#13;
for working fram schoo in 1976?"&#13;
least one-third of those fram the "vocational" schools had the same opinion. A third&#13;
point is that only a handful of graduates, almost all fram S1G, reported any help at&#13;
all from their school in getting a job.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

orkThgg: - What Makes the i&#13;
At the time of the Encond interview, 58% of the senior secondary graduates who&#13;
'canted work had jobs. In other words the probability of working for those who were&#13;
looking for work was aboutl 0.6. There was, however, oonsiderable! variation among&#13;
different groups of indivLduals. See Table 12. In the upper pact of the table,&#13;
individuals are grouped aJs to the characteristics they possessed at the time of&#13;
graduation: age, sex, type and location of school, language spoken at hom,, and&#13;
whether they had-or thought they had-job skills when they left school. In the&#13;
bottom part of the table, individuals are grouped as to actions taken after&#13;
graduation: whether they tried to return to full-time education, took a course, or&#13;
were working at the time of the first interview.&#13;
The highest probability of working was found among those who had been working&#13;
one year earlier, an understandable result given the slow rates of turnover and&#13;
change described above. Among the different schools, the highest: probability of&#13;
working was found among STM graduates and the lowest among SM and SKKA graduates.&#13;
Those who had taken courses had a lower probability of working than those who had not&#13;
taken courses.&#13;
One trouble with such a list as a basis of analysis is that individuals can&#13;
belong to several groups at the same time. Also, association in a group may be&#13;
highly dependent on what has gone on before. For example, SMk graduates have a lower&#13;
probability of working ard so do those who took courses. To what extent is the lower&#13;
probability of working for SMAW graduates independent of course-tbking or do the SMA&#13;
results occur mainly becaluse SMh graduates took courses and henoB delayed their entry&#13;
into the labor market?&#13;

A modified path analysis has been used to measure:   (1)  whether each of the&#13;
various factors listed in Table 12 are associated with a higher, or lower,&#13;
probability that an individual was working at the time of the second interview, after&#13;
taking into account his other characteristics and previous activities; and, (2)&#13;
whether the effects on differences in the probability of working are obtained&#13;
directly or indirectly, tihat is, through an intervening variable. The analysis&#13;
consists of a series of logit regressions in which the 'preconditions,' those&#13;
characteristics in place at the time of graduation, are the initial independent&#13;
variables; the intervening variables, the various outcoes or events that occur&#13;
between leaving school and the final interview, are at first dependent and then added&#13;
to the list of independent variables. Results for Jakarta and the rest of Indonesia&#13;
are summarized in the first and second parts respectively of Table 13; full results&#13;
are contained in Appendix 3. (A separate analysis was made of Jakarta because of&#13;
substantial differences in both individual characteristics and labor market outcomes&#13;
among graduates fram Jakarta and the rest of the country. Also, the sample schools&#13;
included no SMEA school in Jakarta.)  The entries in Table 13 indlicate the marginal&#13;
effects of the independent variables on the probability that the particular dependent&#13;
variable will occur. As indicated in the Appendix, the marginal effect of an&#13;
independent variable will vary depending upon the other characteristics of the&#13;
individual. Each 'marginal effect' entered in Table 13 is the increase (or decrease)&#13;
in probability for a typical or modal individual compared to the probability had the&#13;

entire grouping of variables not been oonsidered. Fbr example, oonsider the&#13;
probability that graduates outside Jakarta took other courses. The marginal effect&#13;
of attending an STK school on the probability of taking courses is -.07; that is, the&#13;
probability of taking courses for STM graduates was .07 lower than the probability&#13;
obtained had type of school not been considered. The figure was obtained by&#13;
estimating the probability for a modal graduate outside Jakarta (male, speaking a&#13;
regional language, living outside Java, who thought he had job skills) and then&#13;
re-estimating the probability for the same individual fram an STM school. The first&#13;
figure is .17; the second is .10. Hence, the marginal effect of STI education is&#13;
-.07. Only results that are significant with a degree of confidence of at least .90&#13;
are included in the table. A zero entry (0) in Table 13 indicates that the variable&#13;
was in the equation but, after controlling for all other variables, there was no&#13;
significant impact on the probability. An X entry indicates that the program did not&#13;
accept the entire group of variables since it did not appreciably affect the&#13;
probability in question.&#13;
The results can be used to explore a number of issues. Let us, for example,&#13;
examine the hypothesis that other activities, like taking courses or trying to&#13;
continue education, delay serious labor force entry and therefore reduce the&#13;
probability of working. Regressions one and two describe patterns associated with&#13;
higher or lower probabilities of one of the other activities; regressions three and&#13;
four describe the effects of these and other activities, as well as other variables,&#13;
on the probabilities of working.&#13;
In Jakarta, whether a graduates tried to return to school was not influenced by&#13;
type of school or other factors in the equation. As for course-taking, STM graduates&#13;
were less likely to have taken courses (regression two) than were other graduates and&#13;
older graduates less likely than younger ones. Whether a person had tried to return&#13;
to school or had taken a course, however, had no apparent effect on whether a,&#13;
individual was working in either 1977 or 1978.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
As for graduates frcm the rest of Indonesia: the probability of wanting to go&#13;
tack to school was lower for those living ourside Java and for oldier gradutes; those&#13;
svho went to STM schools were less likely to have taken additional courses comipared&#13;
%ith SM&amp; graduates; and men were less likely than wamen to have dane so. Wanting to&#13;
§o back to school was associated with a lower probability of workiLng in 1977, but not&#13;
in 1978. Taking courses had no impact on whether a person was working in 1977 but it&#13;
did significantly reduce the probability of working in 1978. Thus, there is support&#13;
for the hypothesis that other activities delay labor force entry and thereby reduce&#13;
the probability of working, but only among graduates outside Jakarta.&#13;
The modified path analysis produced other important findings relevant to the&#13;
central issues in this papsr:&#13;
(a) In Jakarta, STM4 graduates have a higher probability of&#13;
working than do graduates from SMA, but only for 1977.&#13;
(Regressions three and four for Jakarta.)  The better&#13;
job success for SIM graduates shown in Table 12 and&#13;
later in Table 17 comes entirely in the first year after&#13;
graduation. Onca one controls for whether graduates&#13;
were working in the first year, then differences between.&#13;
SMA and STM disalppear, which implies that the rate of&#13;
absorption fran the pool of those without work as about&#13;
the same for the two schools during the second year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
(b) Those persons who said that they had gotten job skills&#13;
from school had a higher probability of working than those&#13;
who did not think they had such skills; these effects were&#13;
significant for increasing the probability of working in&#13;
1978 as well as in 1977. (Regressions three and four.)&#13;
There is a cause and effect problem for interpreting the&#13;
1977 results since the question about job skills was not&#13;
asked until the 1977 interview. Therefore, there is no&#13;
way to tell whether it was geting a job that helped&#13;
young people realize that they really did have job&#13;
skills that are useful in work. However, the results of&#13;
the final regression-those who reported job skills&#13;
from school in 1977 had a significantly higher&#13;
probability of working in 1978-indicate the real&#13;
possibility that such a belief may actually have some effect&#13;
on success in getting a job. This should be an area for&#13;
further investigation.&#13;
One should not overstate the results of this analysis. There is a high&#13;
correlation betwen work in 1977 and work in 1978 but only some oorrelation between&#13;
working and the other variables in the models. Most of thehvariationu in whether&#13;
graduates are working or not no doubt remains unexplained.1 The main point is&#13;
that the type of school does have an impact, and, to some extent, so do actions taken&#13;
by graduates, location, and whether a person thinks he has job skills.&#13;
"Ihe R2 in ordinary least squares is a measure of what proportion of the&#13;
variation in the dependent variable is 'explained" by variations in the independent&#13;
variables. There is no comparable   statistic to an W  in logit regression.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
What is "Employment"?&#13;
The simple dichotcny of having a job and being jobless does not give a complete&#13;
picture about labor market sucoess. Success can depend not only on whether an&#13;
individual has a job but also on what type of job he has. The data in Table 14&#13;
describe various aspects of jobs held by members of the cohort at the time of the two&#13;
interviews. The figures are presented to show not only the characteristics of the&#13;
jobs at each point in timne but also what type of changes took place over the two-year&#13;
period. At the time of the first interview, 63% were not working, 9% were working&#13;
for the government or in a government enterprise, 20% were working for private&#13;
employers and 9% had an 'other" job (mostly unpaid family or own account work). At&#13;
the time of the second inlterview the proportion not working had fallen to 42%o The&#13;
increase in employment had come entirely fran increases in either government&#13;
employment (to 19%) or working for a private employer (to 31%); the number working in&#13;
the 'other" category stayed about the same.&#13;

The second group of figures describes the pay level for the umnployed (for those&#13;
for whcm there is that information). Separate figures are provided for the graduates&#13;
who were and those who were not working in Jakarta. The groth in employment between&#13;
the first and second interview were mostly in the higher paid jobs. The bottctm set&#13;
cE figures contains a subjective judgement about the job: what did the respondent&#13;
wio was working think aboul: prospects for the future in his or her job? A&#13;
s:Lgnificant minority of those working thought that prospects in their job were not&#13;
goods, an equal number thought prospects were moderate, and the smallest group thought&#13;
thley had jobs with very gocd prospects. The increase in employmenlt took place almost&#13;
ertirely in jobs that had at least moderate prospects and much of lthe increase was in&#13;
jcbs which respondents identified as having very good prospects.&#13;
Overall, the number of persons with jobs increased, probably the quality of&#13;
those jobs increased, but, at both times at which members of the cohort were&#13;
interviewed, there was great variation in the quality of jobs among those who had&#13;
work.&#13;
-am      In i  Innloy_e .&#13;
The figures presented no far indicate: (1) there was a substantial increase in&#13;
emqloyment over the two-yeau period covered in the tracer study and these increases&#13;
were mostly in better quality, higher paid jobs (Table 14); (2) there was some&#13;
tuwnover among members of the cohort (Table 9); and, (3) many graduates delayed&#13;
loclking for or getting work either because they wanted to go back to school, or to&#13;
take short courses, or for other reasons not captured in the interview. This section&#13;
exslores the issue of whether a delay in getting work reduces the possibility that&#13;
the person will be able to get a reasonably well-paying job when he or she eventually&#13;
does find work.&#13;
Regression analysis was used to explore this issue. First, sane oorrelations&#13;
wiLL be presented. If one looks at the graduates working in 1978, there is a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
significant correlation between their rate of pay and the type of school attended,&#13;
their sex, the language spoken at hone and how many months they had been working.&#13;
Rates of pay were substantially higher in Jakarta. In addition, there were&#13;
substantial differences in the correlation results for those persons working in&#13;
Jakarta and those working somewhere else in Indonesia. In Jakarta, SM9 graduates&#13;
were earning less than STM graduates; elsewhere in Indonesia, the SMA graduates&#13;
included in the tracer study clearly were not earning ,ess and probably were earning&#13;
more than STM graduates, and SMEA graduates were earning the least. For Jakarta,&#13;
there is a clear positive relationship between how long a person had been working (or&#13;
whether he or she had gone to work early on after leaving school) and how nuch he was&#13;
earning; the relationship outside Jakarta was in the same direction but was not&#13;
statistically significant.&#13;
Regressions were run separately for men and wonen and for those in Jakarta and&#13;
those in the rest of Indonesia. The dependent variable was the natural logarithm for&#13;
the rate of pay in 1978. Included in the independent variables was a dumm variable&#13;
describing the job, or lack of one, as of the time of the first interview in 1977.&#13;
Those who had been working were grouped as to whether they had been in the lower,&#13;
middle, or upper third of the wage distribution that was obtained at the time of the&#13;
first interview. Results are shown in Table 15. Clearly, the previous job has an&#13;
important influence on the quality of subsequent employment. For example, outside&#13;
Jakarta, a man who had been working in a better paying job in 1977 was earning on the&#13;
average 71% more per month than the man who had not been working earlier but was in a&#13;
job at the time of the second interview. However, the young man who had been working&#13;
earlier in a poor paying job was earning 20% less than one who was working in 1978&#13;
but had not had a job when previously interviewed. Outside Jakarta, graduates who&#13;
delayed their entry were at a significant advantage over those who had gone to work&#13;
but at a low paid job; in Jakarta, those who waited had no advantage but they also&#13;
clearly had no disadvantage either, compared with those who had earlier worked in low&#13;
paid jobs.&#13;

A &amp;MEr     bu       ues  n the :LB      rket&#13;
If one measures the job success of graduates in terms of hce miany have jobs at&#13;
any particular time, then the analysis of the Indonesian cohort clearly indicates&#13;
that a most important factor is how soon a person gets a first job. Delays in&#13;
getting that job such as trying to go on to further education, or taking courses, or&#13;
waiting for a good job tc cone along, slcows the process and makes joblessness higher&#13;
than it would otherwise have been.&#13;

However, if one's measure of success includes whether or not the person is in a&#13;
good job, then the conclusions are somewhat modified. The type of job that an&#13;
individual has at one time is heavily influenced by the type of job he or she has had&#13;
previously. Those members of the cohort with the best chanoe of being in a good&#13;
paying job in 1978 were those who were in a good paying job in 1977. A graduate&#13;
whose entry into work was delayed, though, had not lost his chance of getting a good&#13;
paying job. Indeed, graduates who went to work in a second year after graduation had&#13;
just as good an opportumity in Jakarta, and a better opportunity outside Jakarta, to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
43&#13;
be in a good paying job than did those who were working earlier but in a poor paying&#13;
job.&#13;
The regression results presented earlier can be used to estimate the returns to&#13;
waiting until a good job is obtained. For example, an employed nale graduate, living&#13;
outside Jakarta, who was in a low paying job in 1977 earned Rp 11,000 per month in&#13;
1978; a young man who had not been working at all in 1977 but was working in 1978&#13;
earned Rp 13,300. The young man who waited for a better job for a year, sayj, gave&#13;
up Rp 132,000 in a year's lost income but ultimately gained an additional Rp 28,000&#13;
in yearly inoome. If this latter difference were to be permanent., a year's wait&#13;
would yield a real rate oE&#13;
return of more than 21%.&#13;
Conclusions about Une     mD t Rates&#13;
One of the issues adiressed in this paper is whether the high unemployment rates&#13;
reported in SAKERNAS are eavidence of an oversupply of secondary school graduates, a&#13;
sign that secondary schooL should not be expanded. My conclusion is that such rates&#13;
Jo not necessarily mean an oversupply. The unemployment rates are obtained by taking&#13;
"ross-sectional snapshots of young people engaged in the lengthy process of mwving&#13;
Erom school to work. The results of the tracer study indicate that "unemploymentm is&#13;
at best an inappropriate imeasure of how well those young people are progressing.&#13;
There is always a problem of distortion when one tries to describe with a single&#13;
index a situation with multiple social and economic dimensions. The process of&#13;
noving from school to workc has at least two other important dimensions beyond those&#13;
zaptured in employment anti unemployment figures:  (1) many young people in Indonesia&#13;
are more interested in fuwther education than in getting a job. The labor force&#13;
oncept assumes a comuitrmnt to the labor force and does not take into account other&#13;
wctivities, even those thiat could have long term importance for labor market success;&#13;
and, (2) concern about UInUnploymentu carries with it the implicit assumption that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
employment is success and unemploymnkt failure. But "employment" in Indorsia can be&#13;
anything from low pay, low productivity worku in the informal sector to a relatively&#13;
well paid job with career possibilities.  Thus, wunmployment" which ends with a&#13;
reasonably good job is a better outoome than is continuous low paid, low productivity&#13;
work.&#13;
Each year a fresh cohort of new secondary school graduates leaves school and&#13;
enters the labor market. The tracer study indicates that some get work almost&#13;
imediately but a substantial number do not. The probability of unemployment for a&#13;
fresh graduate is high but it steadily declines over time, and his or her initial&#13;
unemiployment does not harm his chances of getting a good job later on, at least&#13;
during the period for which we have data. The tracer study information ends after&#13;
the second year when 40% of the out-of-school graduates had yet to find work but&#13;
there is no sign that the process of absorption had begun to slow down. None of the&#13;
persons interviewed had dropped out of the labor foroe because of discouragement in&#13;
finding work; indeed, the amount of search was higher in the second year than it was&#13;
in the first. And the net additions to the graduates' jobs were better in the second&#13;
year than in the first. An extrapolation of the cohort's experienoe based on the&#13;
cross-sectional data of SAKERNDS, showing that unemployment rates steadily decline&#13;
with age, indicate that all members of the cohort are eventually absorbed into work.&#13;
Thus, measured unemployment is high because there is a group (a large group relative&#13;
to its age/education oohort) which is in the process of going from school to work.&#13;
The group is eventually absorbed into work but is constantly being replaced by fresh&#13;
oohorts of new school leavers. High unemplcyment rates are generated by having&#13;
substantial numbers of persons who have long periods of looking for work. A rate of&#13;
unemployment for a particular age/education cohort that is dbminated by newcamers is&#13;
no guide to the labor market success of that particular level or type of education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
IE, as looks to be the cast with the Indonesian secondary school graduates, all are&#13;
erentually absorbed into saployment, then one should look to the quality of that&#13;
anployment to judge whether or not their education has been a success.&#13;
IV.   I; SEB0!IRRY EWUCXION A GOOD INVEMNT?&#13;
There is no question that secondary education opens up job opportunities for the&#13;
gi-aduate that are unobtainable to someone without that level of education. The&#13;
SJMFiNAS material cited earlier shows a very substantial wage adv&amp;atage for the&#13;
person who has oampleted se=ondary education as opposed to one with just a primary&#13;
education. Therefore, bothl sets of data indicate that secondary school graduates are&#13;
K ire proc tive than are thlose with just a primary education. Hom,ever, the increases&#13;
irn productivity have been obtained at some cost: both the resouracs that went into&#13;
tte secondary education and the foregone earnings because the young people were in&#13;
sctool rather than working and thereby contributing to the eooany.   In order to&#13;
de-termine whether a secondary education is a good investment, one imst determine how&#13;
efficiently increases in productivity have been obtained. One such indicator is the&#13;
sccial rate of return which takes into account both the higher earnings (a proxy for&#13;
the increase in productivity) and the costs of the education that cnntributed to&#13;
those higher earnings.&#13;
Estimates of the social rate of return to senior secondary education are&#13;
contained in Table 16. Rates were calculated using the short-cut nethod&#13;
(Psacharopoulos). Details are in the Appendix. Estimates of resource costs caan&#13;
from a study of secondary school finances made parallel to the tracer study (Widodo).&#13;
Foregone earnings have been estimated fron tracer study data. the additional&#13;
earnings were based on SAKEMNAS data adjusted for the wait before graduates get jobs&#13;
as demonstrated by the tracar&#13;
&#13;

1It would probably be better to use only SAKERNAS or only tracer study data for&#13;
the earnings to insert in the rate of return formula. Neither source, however, is&#13;
ideal; therefore, both were used. What is needed is information on wage rate&#13;
differences throughout Indonesia, preferably for the private sector where&#13;
administered wages would probably be less of a problem. Unfortunately, neither the&#13;
tracer study nor SAKERNAS data completely neet these criteria. The tracer study does&#13;
contain wage rates in the private sector for various locations. Unfortunately, the&#13;
tracer study obtained no information about primary school graduates in Jakarta, where&#13;
wages are substantially higher than elsewhere. Comparing wage rates of secondary&#13;
school graduates in Jakarta with primary school earnings in other parts of the&#13;
country would likely give biased results. Another problem with the tracer data is&#13;
that the earnings of primary graduates obtained in the study are of very young&#13;
persons (14 years old, on the average). SAKERNAS provides nationwide figures for&#13;
urban and rural areas but there are no separate figures for employment in the private&#13;
sector. SMk graduates are treated separately fron 'vocational" graduates, but the&#13;
latter group presumably includes all types of schools including those not under the&#13;
Ministry of Education.&#13;

for differences in earnings; which might be attributed to better native ability or&#13;
adivantages possessed ty secondary school graduates but not by those who only finished&#13;
plimary school.&#13;
The returns to senior secondary education are impressive even with the slow&#13;
emnployment absorption. If a graduate has to wait two years, on the average, before&#13;
gc'ing to work, the rate of return to his education is 16% (third column). This&#13;
figure is the r,Limated annual return to the extra costs of six years of education&#13;
beyond the primary level.  This rate, as well as others in the tabjle, are real rates,&#13;
already adjusted for inflation. Clearly, senior seoondary education is a good&#13;
investment.&#13;
The table also includes the rate of return to the last three years of senior&#13;
secondary education (SLTA) as compared to the rate for junior secondary school&#13;
(SLTP).l Junior secondary education appears to be a good investmentt, but senior&#13;
seoondary is even better.&#13;
iTiis paper has said nothing about junior secondary education because there is&#13;
very little information about labor market results of these graduates.   The tracer&#13;
stixdy included junior secondary (SUP) graduates, but 90% of those graduates went on&#13;
to further education so the sample of persons in the labor market was quite small.&#13;
Thiose individuals from junior secondary who did want work had an even longer wait to&#13;
gel: a job, and when they dicl get work, their pay was substantially lower as comppared&#13;
with graduates from upper secondary, but they were three years younger. 'The rate of&#13;
return to junior secondary sbhool was calculated using the same method and data&#13;
sources as for senior gradualtes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
what Mm of             School Should )Be ExpamIad&#13;
Table 16 contains rates of return to academic (SM) and vocational" senior&#13;
secondary education. The returns are highest for academic graduates. These figures&#13;
aggregate all secondary graduates working in urban areas of Indonesia and the&#13;
uvocationalm results are for all types of specialized education. Tracer study data&#13;
provide information about job success for graduates of different types of specialized&#13;
schools and for different regions. The best job record was among SPG graduates for&#13;
reasons described earlier. The record for the other graduates is oontained in Table&#13;
17. In Jakarta, SIM graduates had a substantially better record than those from 5M9:&#13;
a higher proportion were working and at higher rates of pay. In other parts of Java,&#13;
SMA graduates had the highest proportion working but the earnings of the three types&#13;
of schools were about the same. Outside Java, aM&amp; graduates had the best record:&#13;
more were working and at higher rates of pay than other graduates.&#13;
The rates of return point to academic (SM) senior secondary education as the&#13;
better investentt, even if one takes into account the finding that graduates from&#13;
some vocational schools get jobs more quickly and thus have shorter waiting tines.&#13;
The tracer study data, however, show that in some locations graduates frao one type&#13;
of school are earning substantially more than academic graduates. Together these two&#13;
sets of figures indicate that academic education overall is the best investment but&#13;
there are probably locations where one (or more) of the specialized schools deserve&#13;
an even higher priority.&#13;

There is wide variation among countries around the world in the importance of&#13;
vocational eaucation at the secondary level. Some countries have large numbers of&#13;
students in vocational schools at the secondary level, others have very few. Table 1&#13;
in this Appendix summarizes figures about the ratio of vocational students to&#13;
students in general academic education at the secondary level for all countries for&#13;
which there are data. That ratio in Indonesia was 0.41s that is, for every 100&#13;
students in academic (SMN) schools there were 41 students in specialized or&#13;
vocational eaucation. As indicated in Table 1, there were ten countries, all of them&#13;
among tne developed countries, who had more vocational students than academic, and&#13;
another eleven with ratios of less than one but with a ratio equal to or higher than&#13;
that ot Inoonesia. The vast majority of the countries, particularly the less&#13;
developed ones, have smaller ratios than does Indonesia. Clearly, Indonesia places&#13;
more emphasis on vocational and technical education than do most of the developing&#13;
countries.&#13;

According to the 1978 Labor Foroe Survey, the total labor force in urban&#13;
Inoonesia was just over 8 million persons including 493,000 unemployed (see Table 2).&#13;
Persons under 25 ma.  up about 25% of the total labor force and 73% of the&#13;
unemplcyment.  Indeed, virtually aLl (87%) of the unemployment was among those who&#13;
were under the age or 30. Open unemphoyment in urban areas is clearly a situation&#13;
that occurs aLmcJt exclusively among young people.&#13;
At the tim of the survey the unemployment rate of all persons under 30 was 13%.&#13;
The rate was 16% for those under 25 and 6% for those 25-29. Most of the uremployed&#13;
young pecple had never worked. Only 23% of the unemployed under the age of 20 had&#13;
held a job. The proportion with prior work experience does rise with age but even&#13;
among the unemployed aged 25-29 only 52% have had previous work experience.&#13;
The figures fram the labor force survey present the labor market situation at&#13;
cne moment in time. Pesults from a crude stock and flcw analysis about unmployment&#13;
over the course of an entire year are shown in Table 3.&#13;

Source: Based on data from SAi  RNAS, 1978. See Appendix text for&#13;
procedures used.&#13;
The figures were arrivel at in the following fashion. At any cne point in time&#13;
during 19/8 there were an esl:imated 429,000 unemployed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
persons below the age or thirty.   This figure is the net result of gross flows&#13;
among individuals into and out of unemployment. The same figure would have resulted&#13;
had tnere been 429,000 persons all with a spell of unemployment lasting the entire&#13;
year, or 858,000 persons all with an unemployment spell lasting six months, or&#13;
1,720,000 persons each with a spell lasting three months, etc. The first column&#13;
contains estimates fcr the length of the spell of unemployment for those who were&#13;
unemployea at the time of the 1978 labor force survey; the figures are based upon&#13;
duration of unemployment reported in the survey. The duration reported in the survey&#13;
refers to the amount of time that the unemployed had been looking for a job at the&#13;
time or the survey and not to the total length of muemployment since the spell had&#13;
not yet ended. If one assumes a steady state situation (an assumption used&#13;
throughout the procedure used to estimate these figures), then the unemployea were,&#13;
on the average, halfway through their spell of unemployment. Thus, there were about&#13;
33,000 persons in the midst of a spell lasting somewhere up to three months, 112, 000&#13;
in a spell that lasted anywhere fran four to seven months, 98,000 in a spell that&#13;
lasted eight to thirteen months, etc. (There is no way to tell wic±h individuals&#13;
were in the middle or a short spell and which were not.)&#13;
'Ihe 1978 labor force survey contains information about the duration of&#13;
unemployment among the unemployed but the figures are presented without regard to&#13;
age. Since most of the unemployment is among individuals munder the age of 30 it&#13;
seems safe to use the duration data to describe stocks and flows among the young. In&#13;
this spirit, the distribution for duration of unemployment for all unemployed has&#13;
been applied to derive the estimated number of length of unemployment spells for&#13;
persons under the age of 30 oontained in Table 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55&#13;
The third column in Tablle 3 contains estimates of the number of unemployment&#13;
spells occurring over the entire year. For exmple, if at any one point in time&#13;
there are 33,000 persons in a spell of unemnployment lasting up to three months, there&#13;
1&#13;
will be about 264,000 of such spells occurring over the year.  Thus, there will&#13;
be a total of about 807,000 spells over the oourse of a year in a latbor force&#13;
numbering about 3,400,000. Thus, unemployment is experienced by more individuals&#13;
than is implied by the cross-sectional data. Nevertheless, a large part of the&#13;
unemployment reported by the labor foroe survey cames from the relatively 5mall&#13;
number of persons who have a long period of unemployment. Over the course of the&#13;
year, there were about 5 million person months of unemoloyment. Sixty-four percent&#13;
of the unemployment was accounted for by the 299,000 individuals (or about 12% of the&#13;
totiL labor force) who had er,ells lasting eight months or more.&#13;
1If each spell lasted an aveicage ot one and one-half months, 33,000 spells in&#13;
cro3s-section would impLy about 264,000 such spells over a year. Ihe number of&#13;
speLls is not equivalent to ithe number of individuals experiencing unemployment in&#13;
the course of one year since one person can have more than one spell of unemployment&#13;

APPENDIX 3&#13;
Ihe milti-variate analyses of factors that affect the probability of continuing&#13;
education (Table 6) and working (Table 13) both involve 0,1 dependent variables.&#13;
Hence, regressions using a logit transformation have been applied (see Judge for&#13;
description of problems involved in using a 0,1 dependent variable and the&#13;
justification for using a logit transformation) using the BMDP program (Dixon). Ihis&#13;
is a stepwise program in which the program chooses, from among all groups of&#13;
variables entered in the analysis, the most useful group to first enter in the&#13;
equation. The various types of schools is an example of a group of variables; the&#13;
program would enter ail five school types and measure the effect of each school type.&#13;
The program stops entering variables when additional variables do not significantly&#13;
improve the probability estimates. Thus, the sunmary tables in the text list: (1)&#13;
all variable groups entered in the analysis; (2) those variables accepted by the&#13;
program and significantly improving the estimated probability (those not accepted are&#13;
marked with an X); and, (3) final estimates of significance after taking into account&#13;
all other variables entered in the final equation. The output of particular interest&#13;
is the "coefficient" and the coefficient divided by the standard error. (See&#13;
following Appendix tables.) The latter can be read roughly as a t statistic; these&#13;
values have been used to indicate whether or not the variable is significantly&#13;
associated with changes in the probability for the particular dependent variable.&#13;
Since there has been a log transformation, the probability cannot be read directly&#13;
from the ooefficients. Instead:&#13;
Probability&#13;
econstant + coef. variable 1..+ coef. variable n&#13;
+econstant + ooef. variable l...+coef. variable n&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

F3r example the probabilitr that a male SMA graduate fram Jakarta will continue his&#13;
elucatiom =&#13;
e1.41 + 0.56 + 0.26 - .02&#13;
I+e71.41 + 0.56 + 0.26 - .02&#13;
The third column in eich of the following tables oontains an estimated&#13;
'rmarginal' effect ot the pirticular variable. Ihis value is the increase or decrease&#13;
in probability that the dejpndent variable will occur as compared to the situation&#13;
had that entire group ot variables not been entered.  Calculations are made for the&#13;
modal individuai, the individual with the significant characteristics most often&#13;
found in the cohort of graduates included in the analysis. Characteristics of the&#13;
noaal individual are found at the end of each table. For example, the modal&#13;
individual for Table A, logit results for text table 6, was a SMA graduate, male, who&#13;
spoKe a regional language, lived outside Java, and was 20 or 21 years old when he&#13;
graduated. The 'marginal' effect of the SMA education was .12; that is, the&#13;
Frobability that this modal individual would continue his education was 12 percentage&#13;
points higher than if the type of his education had not been considered at all.&#13;

Private costs are the weighted average of cost to parents&#13;
of one child in a state school. Separate figures were&#13;
given for lower and upper secondary. The data were&#13;
collected from the same eight regions as were students in&#13;
the tracer study. T]here was wide variation in the amounts&#13;
reported in the sample and the figures may not be&#13;
representative of the entire nation. Government costs are&#13;
weighted average of routine cost per student per year.&#13;
Both figures refer to 1977 and have been increased by 8%&#13;
to account for the fall in the real purchasing power of the&#13;
Rupiah between 1977 ;md 1978.&#13;

            How secondary school graduates perform in
            the labor market : a study of Indonesia
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A two-year tracer study for a cohort of
            senior secondary school graduates in Indonesia addresses the
            issue of whether senior secondary education should be
            expanded. The survey found that graduates earn substantially
            more but also have higher unemployment rates than do those
            with less education. The higher income points toward
            expansion; the unemployment indicates oversupply, evidence
            against expansion. However, further analysis reveals that
            the unemployment rate is inflated by the fact that a
            significant number of these graduates wait some time before
            accepting employment for a variety of reasons. Virtually all
            senior secondary graduates who want work are eventually
            absorbed into jobs at pay rates that are substantially
            higher than among those with lesser amounts of education.
            The paper concludes that senior secondary education is a
            good investment and warrants expansion.
