Country and Sector Background&#13;
CURRENT SITUATION IN THE SOCIAL SECTORS&#13;
Substantial Growth and Improvement in Poverty Under Structural&#13;
Adjustment&#13;
1.    Although Tanzania remains one of the poorest countries in the world,&#13;
with estimated per capita GNP in 1995 of only $120 (World Bank, 1997), there&#13;
has been steady positive growth in the economy since adjustment began in 1984.&#13;
Growth was fast enough that, despite a population growth rate of about 2.8&#13;
percent per year, even in per capita terms incomes grew rapidly in the second&#13;
half of the 1980s, with slower growth prevailing in the 1990s.&#13;
2.    Tanzania's success in rural poverty reduction through growth is an&#13;
impressive achievement. A comparison of 1991 and 1983 data on rural&#13;
household incomes shows that the resumption of economic growth in the 1980s&#13;
substantially improved the lot of the rural poor. In 1983, 65 percent of the&#13;
population was living on less than $1 a day equivalent; this percentage dropped&#13;
by 14 points to 51 percent by 1991. The percent of the population in severe&#13;
poverty (less than $0.75 per day) fell from 51 percent in 1983 to 42 percent in&#13;
1991. As a result, there are actually fewer people living below $0.75 per day&#13;
today than in 1983: nearly 11 million in 1983, and about 9 million in 1991.&#13;
Without economic growth, population growth alone would have swelled the&#13;
ranks of the poor from 11 million in 1983 to at least 14 million in 1991.&#13;
Failure to Improve Social Sector Outcomes&#13;
3.    Growth has been accompanied by greater inequality. The very poor&#13;
appear to have fallen behind, most&#13;
likely due to the skewed          Figure 1. Gross Primary School&#13;
distribution of human capital and       Enrollment Rates&#13;
rural infrastructure. Moreover,&#13;
despite steady income growth,&#13;
indicators of basic human welfare   120&#13;
have been stagnant or worsening  100         *&#13;

1980 1985 1990 1995&#13;
1982, dropped to 82 per thousand&#13;
live births in 1995. Life&#13;
expectancy at birth was estimated&#13;
to be 51 in 1995, compared to 52 in 1982. This frustrating lack of progress on&#13;
key indicators of human capital investment and welfare persists despite&#13;
substantial investments to improve the supply of social services (which may&#13;
have been due to inappropriate design of the interventions) and despite income&#13;
growth (which should have contributed independently to improved social&#13;
indicators). The Tanzania Social Sector Review (SSR, World Bank 1995)&#13;
concluded that increasing enrollments and improving the poor quality of&#13;
schooling at both the primary and secondary levels, coupled with improved&#13;
opportunities for girls, are the highest priority areas for intervention to reverse&#13;
this stagnation in human capital and welfare outcomes. This project takes aim at&#13;
these problems, which are discussed in more detail in the next few paragraphs.&#13;
MAIN SECTORAL ISSUES&#13;
5.     The SSR-which surveyed education, health, family planning, water and&#13;
sanitation, and nutrition-concluded that the highest priority areas of attention are&#13;
as follows:&#13;
The secondaiy enrollment rate is sensitive to what is included in the numerator and the denominator, and&#13;
there has been some disagreement in Tanzania over the actual rate. Using official statistics for 1995 and&#13;
census data, we estimate the 1995 gross enrollment rate for lower secondary at 6.75 percent and for&#13;
upper secondary at 1.09 percent. These figures exclude enrollments in teacher training colleges. If&#13;
Grade A teacher training college enrollments are added to upper secondary, the gross enrollment rate at&#13;
that level would increase to 2.02 percent. The age ranges for the denominator are 14-17 for Forms I-IV&#13;
and 18-19 for Forms V-VI.&#13;

Low Enrollments and Poor Quality of Primary Schooling&#13;
6.   In 1993/94, the average girl starting primary school in Tanzania was 9&#13;
years old, and the average boy&#13;
was nearly 10. By the time these Figure 3. Primary Education: Recurrent&#13;
children reach ages 14 to 17, only        Spending 1995&#13;
5 to 8 years later, about 50 percent&#13;
have already left secondary school         4%&#13;
(or had never even started). How&#13;
to get more children, especially&#13;
girls, into school earlier is the first                  [ili]&#13;
problem (the quantity problem).                           Materials&#13;
How to make sure schools are&#13;
effective in keeping them there,&#13;
advancing them, and providing a      87%&#13;
good education is the second&#13;
problem (the quality problem).&#13;
7.    Low spending on primary education is an contributing factor to this&#13;
situation. Public spending in 1995 of $23.96 per primary school pupil was&#13;
allocated almost entirely to teachers' salaries and emoluments, plus examination&#13;
costs (Figure 3). Parents added an estimated $7.76 to government spending, for&#13;
a total of $31.72 per pupil. About 42 percent of the parental contribution was&#13;
for uniforms; for the poorest fifth of the parents, uniforms constituted 59 percent&#13;
of the contribution. The result is low spending on non-salary and non-uniform&#13;
inputs at the primary level, and conditions in the schools reflect it. School&#13;
buildings are in terrible condition: 70 percent of the 3.7 million primary&#13;
students do not have desks; 30 percent of the 105,280 teachers do not have a&#13;
chair or a desk; and learning materials are scarce. A recent survey found that&#13;
schools in 27 out of 30 districts appeared to have attained the government's&#13;
objective of 1 textbook for every 3 students, yet the books were not in the&#13;
classrooms. While learning "can take place under a tree," it is done most&#13;
effectively when the teacher can devote time to the students and has materials to&#13;
work with, which is typically not the case in Tanzania today.&#13;
Low Secondary School Enrollments&#13;
8.    Entry to secondary school in Tanzania has historically been rationed for&#13;
manpower planning purposes, at least up to 1986, when non-government schools&#13;
were allowed to enter the market. Rationing has deprived the country of a large&#13;
stock of human capital in comparison with all other countries, has unintentionally&#13;
channeled public subsidies for post-primary schooling to the better off, and has&#13;
distorted the country's income distribution by raising the returns to schooling for&#13;
the select few who advance through the system. Failing to get more girls through&#13;
secondary school has reduced the impact of other costly investments Tanzania has&#13;

First and foremost,&#13;
the social impacts of completing primary and secondary school for girls in&#13;
Tanzania are extremely high. Apart from improving the welfare of the girls&#13;
themselves, education for girls provides benefits beyond the individual herself in&#13;
the form of better health, nutritional, and educational outcomes for her family.&#13;
Just one indicator of these benefits is the difference in various dimensions of&#13;
fertility-related behavior for girls who complete primary or higher levels of&#13;
education, as summarized in Table 1. The gains shown for each level of&#13;
education are large, and analysis of the data has suggested that this is a causal&#13;
relationship. Yet, as indicated by the bottom row of the table, the task of getting&#13;
a larger proportion of girls through primary and secondary schools is far from&#13;
finished: only 4 percent of the sample of married women between ages 15 and&#13;
45 attended secondary school.&#13;
10.    Girls' participation in education in Tanzania has improved steadily, and&#13;
they have maintained parity with&#13;
boys at the primary level for ten    Figure 4. Proportion of Females at Each&#13;
years (Std IV in Figure 4).                 Educational Level (Percent)&#13;
However, girls remain slightly&#13;
less likely than boys to enter          6&#13;
secondary school (Form I in&#13;
Figure 4). Unfortunately, girls         so&#13;
who do enter secondary school do        40  fStd Iv&#13;

not perform as well as boys and are more likely to drop out. Only about 25&#13;

percent of the students continuing to upper secondary school (Form VI in Figure&#13;
4) are female, and the percentage of women at the university level has at best&#13;
stagnated over the past quarter century. Because of the low enrollment rates,&#13;
these percentages are based on tiny absolute numbers. For example, at the upper&#13;
secondary level in 1995, of only 5,841 students, just 1,556 were female (out of&#13;
an estimated 683,696 19 year-olds).&#13;
11.   Raising general secondary enrollment rates is a high priority, as Tanzania&#13;
falls farther and farther behind the rest of the world in producing secondary&#13;
school leavers. Pursuing this goal by targeting girls, as this project does, will&#13;
raise the social return to the investment.&#13;
Institutional and Governance Issues: Inadequate School-Level&#13;
Management and Little Accountability to Parents and Communities&#13;
12.   One option for improving outcomes in education is simply to increase&#13;
the volume of resources available in the current system of public primary and&#13;
secondary schooling. However, it is widely acknowledged in Tanzania and&#13;
elsewhere that the impact of additional expenditures and the sustainability of&#13;
these improvements can be increased by adding resources in a manner that&#13;
increases the power of teachers to manage the schools, and to increase their&#13;
accountability to parents and to objective standards of performance. In&#13;
Tanzania, while local governments have responsibility for primary schools, they&#13;
are dependent on the central government for all inputs, including policy,&#13;
management, capital, personnel, money, supervision, books, and supplies.&#13;
Responsibility for inputs is fragmented across bureaucracies at the central,&#13;
district, and local levels with the result that there is almost no accountability at&#13;
any point in the system for the results that are being delivered. Parents are&#13;
required to make contributions to the school, but until recently, even these school&#13;
fees were sent to the district.2 Primary school committees have not functioned&#13;
well and are used primarily to enforce compliance with school policies.&#13;
However, as a result of a number of interventions (including training for head&#13;
teachers and the Primary Education Support Program) school committees are&#13;
being strengthened.&#13;
SOCIAL SECTOR STRATEGY&#13;
13.   The Government recognizes these problems and the importance of&#13;
correcting them. It has proposed a framework for the social sectors, the Social&#13;
Sector Strategy (United Republic of Tanzania 1994b), which contains the&#13;
following six basic principles:&#13;
2While this practice was officially changed in the Budget Speech of 1995, it is still apparently widespread.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

14.   The Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) prepared an Education&#13;
and Training Policy (United Republic of Tanzania 1995) that emphasizes&#13;
liberalizing the education sector in step with the rest of the economy and&#13;
increasing the accountability of service providers to clients. A draft Basic&#13;
Education Master Plan (BEMP, United Republic of Tanzania 1997) was&#13;
produced in February 1997 as part of the design and management process for an&#13;
Education Sector Development Program (SDP). These documents recognize the&#13;
need for an adequately funded, pluralistic school system that benefits from&#13;
greater involvement of parents and local government in management. They&#13;
propose additional donor investments in basic education. The BEMP builds on&#13;
innovations in school-based management to be pilot tested under this project and&#13;
decentralized district-based management that is being developed under Danida-,&#13;
DGIS-, and Irish-financed projects.&#13;

PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
15.   At the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) level, the overall program&#13;
rationale for the project is to efficiently increase investment in human capital to&#13;
raise incomes, reduce inequality, and improve non-market outcomes. This is but&#13;
one among an array of IDA-financed activities intended to assist the&#13;
Government to achieve this goal.&#13;

Community Education Fund Pilot&#13;
18.   Objective: to raise enrollments and the quality ofprimary education&#13;
with increased participation of the community and teachers in managing their&#13;
schools (IDA financing: $5.0 million equivalent).&#13;
19.   The Community Education Fund (CEF) pilot is a matching grant&#13;
program for primary schools designed to increase enrollment, improve the&#13;
quality of schooling, and increase parental and community involvement in&#13;
monitoring school performance. Planning of the CEF, begun in March 1995,&#13;
included pre-tests of the design and consultations with beneficiaries over a two-&#13;
ear period, financed by the Education Planning and Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(EPRP).&#13;

20.    During the pilot phase to be financed under this project, districts and/or&#13;
schools will be invited to join the CEF program. For these schools, the&#13;
government's contribution from the recurrent budget will remain unchanged to&#13;
avoid disrupting the operation of the system. The pilot will add funds at the&#13;
margin while helping to develop an institutional framework to enable schools&#13;
ultimately to manage most of their own affairs. The CEF program requires four&#13;
basic steps, as follows:3&#13;
a.     The primary school (typically the teachers and possibly&#13;
the school committee, led by the head teacher) draws up a&#13;
three-year plan.&#13;
b.     Parents and the local government agree to the plan,&#13;
democratically choose a per-pupil contribution to support&#13;
activities for the current year, and pay in half of their&#13;
planned contributions.&#13;
c.     MOEC, through the CEF program, matches parental&#13;
contributions and could in the future match other&#13;
community and district contributions, all according to a&#13;
formula that favors poorer communities/schools (a sliding&#13;
scale with a cap on the per-pupil match).&#13;
d.     Schools account to parents and to the project for their&#13;
expenditures and performance against the school plan.&#13;
The accounting is expected to take place at the midpoint&#13;
(when parents, if satisfied, provide the rest of their&#13;
contributions, which are also matched) and at the end of&#13;
the school year.&#13;
e.     This cycle is repeated annually.&#13;

available in the project file and on the Bank's intranet (http://afr.worldbank.org/aft2/educ/tanzcef.htm).&#13;

will gradually expand to cover all schools in the districts of Kibaha, Kilosa&#13;
(these two districts were fully covered in 1997), Lindi Urban, Mtwara Rural, and&#13;
Sumbawanga Urban (a total of 355 schools, see Table 4).4 The gradual&#13;
expansion of the CEF will be used by the monitoring and evaluation component&#13;
to track its impact. No later than the third and final year, the project will be&#13;
expanded to cover an additional 650 schools on the assumption that the program&#13;
design and implementation experience will at that point be adequate for such an&#13;
expansion. The additional schools (or districts) will be chosen nationally on a&#13;
competitive basis to test the ability of the program to be extended nationwide.&#13;
22.    The project will finance the matching grants plus development costs for&#13;
school-level governance, management, and accountability, including the&#13;
necessary materials and training, plus incremental administrative costs at the&#13;
district level. In addition, for schools that have successfully participated in the&#13;
CEF program, following the first year, the project will solicit academic&#13;
improvement plans and school nutrition/health plans from the schools, to be&#13;
funded on a competitive basis with the limited funds available for this purpose.&#13;
In addition, CEF schools will be eligible to compete for additional grants to&#13;
implement school health and performance improvement programs.&#13;
Girls' Secondary Education Support Pilot&#13;
23.    Objective: to expand educational opportunitiesforgirlsfrom poorer&#13;
families and to improve quality at the lower secondary level (IDAfinancing:&#13;
$6.9 million equivalent).&#13;
24.    As with the CEF, development of the Girls' Secondary Education&#13;
Support (GSES) component has been financed under EPRP, with pre-tests and&#13;
client consultation to improve the design.5 The GSES component provides for&#13;
the following:&#13;
a.      Selection of one poor girl per primary school annually&#13;
(which will usually translate into one girl from each&#13;
4 The number of districts and schools in Table 4 will be subject to revision each year following discussions&#13;
between the Government and IDA. The goal will be to accelerate the expansion, if feasible, so that&#13;
project funds can benefit more schools. However, performance criteria defined in the Project's&#13;
Operational Guidelines will have to be met to justify expansion to more schools.&#13;
The details of the operation of the GSES program are specified in: Girls' Secondary Education Support&#13;
Program: Draft Program Implementation Document (full document and a shorter versions for schools&#13;
and villages). These documents are available in the project file and on the Bank's intranet&#13;

b.     Payment of a bursary by the project to a pre-qualified&#13;
secondary school in which the girl enrolls.&#13;
c.     Monitoring of the girl and the secondary school to make&#13;
sure that agreements are kept and the girl is doing well.&#13;
25.    Girls are eligible for support during all four years of lower secondary&#13;
school. They may interrupt their schooling for up to one year for any reason or&#13;
repeat a year of school and retain eligibility. During the first year of the project,&#13;
the Government will carry out a review of existing policies governing the&#13;
interruption of school attendance by girls in primary and secondary schools and&#13;
prepare an action plan in consultation with IDA, based on the recommendations&#13;
of that review. Twenty percent of the girls with the highest scores on the&#13;
Certificate of Secondary Education Examination each year will be eligible for an&#13;
additional two years of bursary support to complete Forms V and VI, with no&#13;
provision for interrupting their studies or for repeating a year of school. Schools&#13;
and girls are required to keep the "sending" community informed of each girl's&#13;
progress.&#13;

*Calendar Year&#13;
6 Selecting girls has been a problematic area during the pre-test, and experimentation will continue. The&#13;
goal is to finance at least one new girl from each village for secondary school annually. Another&#13;
suggestion has been to finance one girl per stream, so as not to favor smaller schools. In the second year&#13;
of the pre-test, villages could select up to three girls from each school and split the bursary among them&#13;
(requiring in some cases partial support from the parents). This did not work at all and had to be&#13;
stopped because it was too complex and villages resisted making decisions about providing only partial&#13;
support for some girls. In addition, not all selected girls have been able to find a secondary school that&#13;
would take them. It may take several years to discover a workable solution that allows the program to&#13;
&#13;

and private secondary schools. In January, 1997, that number was expanded to&#13;
733, after 23 girls dropped out of the program and 364 new girls entered.&#13;
Additional girls will be added each year of this pilot project, which will require&#13;
that financing for this component be continued through calendar year 2005 (see&#13;
Table 5), until all of the girls qualifying for upper secondary school bursaries&#13;
have finished (see Table 7 for a more detailed explanation of project timing).&#13;
27.   IDA will finance the bursaries plus the costs of setting up and managing&#13;
the GSES program. In addition, for schools that have successfully participated&#13;
in the GSES program, following the first year, the project will solicit academic&#13;
improvement plans and plans to improve the opportunities and care of girls in&#13;
the school. These plans will be generated by the schools, and grants will be&#13;
awarded on a competitive basis with the limited funds available for this purpose.&#13;
Finally, IDA will finance the purchase of science kits to improve the teaching of&#13;
science at the secondary level in Tanzania.7&#13;
Capacity Building&#13;
28.   Objective: to help develop capacity to implement CEF and GSES at all&#13;
levels and to help MOECformulate and implement innovative solutions to&#13;
problems in primary and secondary education (IDA financing: $2.2 million&#13;
equivalent).&#13;
29.   CEF and GSES Training: The CEF and GSES are vehicles for capacity&#13;
building in primary and secondary schools, districts, private firms, and NGOs to&#13;
support school-based management at the primary level and development of a&#13;
primary school-based selection mechanism for the bursary program. During the&#13;
CEF pre-test, there has been a large investment in training materials and&#13;
seminars to familiarize educators and parents with the mechanics of the&#13;
program. Once operating, though, the CEF program facilitates learning-by-&#13;
doing at the community level in school planning, democratically discussing&#13;
options and agreeing to an appropriate level of contributions to support the&#13;
school, procurement, supervision of contractors, and review of implementation&#13;
activities. The pre-test of the GSES program has also required training of&#13;
communities on the value and mechanics of the program, of secondary schools&#13;
on the opportunities and challenges presented by the program, and of district and&#13;
regional education officials to irnplement aspects of it. Through learning-by-&#13;
doing, the GSES pre-test has built capacity by a private contractor to develop&#13;
and manage the bursary program in coordination with district and regional&#13;
achieve its objectives, given the myriad problems parents face in getting children into secondary school&#13;
in Tanzania.&#13;
7These science kits are a carry-over from EPRP, which may have insufficient funds to finance a&#13;
procurement that is at the award stage in FY98. Improving the teaching of science in secondary schools&#13;
is a high priority for MOEC. Assistance for the teaching of science to be funded under this pilot project&#13;
will be targeted partially to benefit girls in the GSES program.&#13;

education officials and secondary schools; capacity and interest at the village&#13;
level in the selection of girls for the award; and capacity in secondary schools to&#13;
meet the needs of these special girls. A particular feature of the GSES program&#13;
has been its contribution to improving knowledge of the secondary school&#13;
system in some villages that have not sent a child to secondary school in many&#13;
years, which is essential for better functioning of this market.&#13;
30.   The pilot project will finance training in CEF schools and training for&#13;
expansion of the GSES program to new primary and secondary schools. The&#13;
initial training may be undertaken by firms, NGOs, and district education&#13;
officials under an open, competitive bidding process. Follow-up after the initial&#13;
training is expected to be the responsibility of the district education team. Funds&#13;
and materials made available after the first year for "just-in-time" assistance to&#13;
district teams and schools and for "help desks" to assist with specific problems&#13;
are expected to address problems that arise.&#13;
31.   Each year the training materials, program documentation, forms, and&#13;
procedures will be reviewed to improve and simplify the program. Learning-by-&#13;
doing will be enhanced through the development of twinning arrangements,&#13;
dissemination of model school plans and best practice, and improved&#13;
documentation for the program, with the ultimate goal that many primary&#13;
schools should be able to implement the program without special training. The&#13;
training element of the program is expected to be expensive, so the MOEC is&#13;
committed to finding ways during the pilot period to minimize these costs to&#13;
increase the potential for national implementation. Incorporating CEF and&#13;
GSES activities into the day-to-day work of district and school officials is a key&#13;
element of planned efforts to reduce administrative costs.&#13;
32.   MOEC/Pilot Management: During the pre-test, the MOEC contracted&#13;
out most of development and implementation of both the CEF and the GSES. It&#13;
may continue to do so for the pilot, but to expand the programs, it has become&#13;
clear that MOEC needs to develop greater capacity to develop, manage, and&#13;
monitor pilot programs of this nature as an element of policy development for&#13;
the sector. During the life of the project, the credit will finance a pilot director, a&#13;
coordinator for each of the components (CEF, GSES, and M&amp;E/Policy/Capacity&#13;
Building), an accountant, a procurement specialist, an internal auditor (with&#13;
skills as a financial analyst and Management Information Systems expert if&#13;
possible), and a small office staff (two secretaries and two drivers8) to support&#13;
them. These personnel are expected to help the Ministry develop the capacity to&#13;
manage recruitment and supervision of outside contractors to assist in training&#13;
and implementation, to develop and manage contracts for complex tasks such as&#13;
data collection and evaluation, to monitor progress of the pilots, to implement a&#13;
communications strategy, and to pilot within the ministry performance-based&#13;

employment contracts for personnel. As changes in public sector employment&#13;
practices are made under civil service reform, it is expected that this&#13;
management group will be absorbed into the regular staff of the MOEC under&#13;
normal terms and conditions of civil service employment, consistent with&#13;
coordinated management of donor-financed activities under the SDP.&#13;
33.   MOEC/Training: The credit will also finance a small training program&#13;
to improve skills in the MOEC in areas where there is a shortage of well trained&#13;
local professionals, including the economics of education, analysis/evaluation of&#13;
education policy, impact evaluation of education programs, finance, and&#13;
educational management. The project will support approximately 5 candidates&#13;
to be selected competitively from among education sector staff and&#13;
approximately 5 candidates selected through a national competition, to seek&#13;
masters degrees in high priority areas explicitly defined in the training program.&#13;
A fixed dollar maximum has been set aside for this program, so the number to be&#13;
trained depends on the cost of each program. IDA-financed training will be&#13;
planned by the Government to be complementary to and consistent with other&#13;
donor-financed training under the SDP.&#13;
34.   MOEC/Conference/Dissemination: The credit will also finance&#13;
participation in a small number of international conferences annually for&#13;
education sector staff to present results of these pilot programs and of&#13;
Tanzania's educational reforms to professional audiences, to gain from greater&#13;
exposure to international practices, and to get feedback on the Tanzanian&#13;
program.&#13;
Policy Development, Planning, and Research&#13;
35.   Objective: to strengthen policy development, planning, and research in&#13;
the education sector through improved testing and statistics systems,&#13;
operations research, policy studies, and strategic sector development plans&#13;
(IDA financing: $4.5 million equivalent).&#13;
36.   A key part of the Government's economic reforms and of its Social&#13;
Sector Strategy has been to re-orient government to its core responsibilities and&#13;
to reorient central ministries to an output and policy orientation. In a&#13;
decentralized system, it is widely agreed that the central ministry responsible for&#13;
education needs to perform a number of core educational tasks to support the&#13;
system, including: (a) a national policy framework; (b) maintenance of the core&#13;
curriculum; (c) teacher certification/standards; (d) technical assistance to lower&#13;
levels of the system; (e) national performance evaluations and national education&#13;
statistics with feedback to educators, policy makers, analysts, parents, and&#13;
students; and (f) monitoring and evaluation of educational programs. As a&#13;
complement to on-going activities of the ministry and other donors iP (a), (b),&#13;
and (c), this project through the capacity building component will provide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Tanzania Human Resource Development Plot Project                is&#13;
support for (d) and under this policy component will provide support for (e) and&#13;
(f), as described below. In addition, the project will assist in high priority&#13;
elements of (a) not currently covered by the government or other donors.&#13;
37.   NECTA (National Examination Council of Tanzania): The project&#13;
will support the mechanization of the national exam system through the use of&#13;
modem scanning and computer technology. This sub-component will support&#13;
implementation of Tanzania's policy to improve the transparency of the&#13;
examination system and provide timely, high quality, reliable feedback to&#13;
teachers, students, policy makers, researchers, and parents. Other donors,&#13;
particularly DffD, are expected to assist in improving the quality of the exams&#13;
themselves, through parallel financing coordinated by MOEC under the SDP.&#13;
38.   MOEC (MOEC Statistics Section): The project will also support the&#13;
mechanization and modernization of MOEC's statistical system. Currently,&#13;
information is hand tabulated at the district level (so school-level data are lost),&#13;
and it is nearly impossible to merge exam data with school data to understand&#13;
better the connection between inputs and outcomes, as measured by exams. As&#13;
with the exam system, support to MOEC's statistical section is intended to&#13;
improve the feedback to schools and parents, and to improve the usefulness and&#13;
timeliness of data to be used by researchers. Other donors, particularly the EU,&#13;
are expected to assist in improving the quality of the statistics, through parallel&#13;
financing coordinated by MOEC under the SDP.&#13;
39.   Pilot Monitoring and Evaluation: A natural element of any school&#13;
system is local-level innovation. In Tanzania, donors, districts, and schools have&#13;
historically supported specific innovations or interventions aimed at improving&#13;
educational outcomes. This project explicitly is testing two innovations on a&#13;
pilot basis. Yet the MOEC does not have an adequate monitoring and&#13;
evaluation capacity to draw lessons for policy and to disseminate best practice&#13;
based on such innovations. This project will sponsor monitoring and evaluation&#13;
of the CEF and GSES components to produce lessons for education policy. In&#13;
doing so, it aims to build this capacity within MOEC as a regular part of its&#13;
operations. DfID, EU, SIDA, and Danida are expected to provide support for&#13;
complementary activities, through parallel financing coordinated by MOEC.&#13;
40.   Pilot Surveys: Feeding into the monitoring and evaluation effort will be&#13;
household, community, and school surveys specifically focused on the CEF and&#13;
GSES pilots under this project, but which may also be of use to evaluate other&#13;
interventions. The project will finance surveys necessary to evaluate the pilots&#13;
and will make them widely available for analysis by education researchers.&#13;
DGIS, DffD, EU, SIDA, and Danida are expected to provide support for&#13;
complementary activities, through parallel financing coordinated by MOEC&#13;
under the SDP.&#13;

41.   Welfare Monitoring: A key function of the central government in a&#13;
decentralized system is to monitor who gains benefits of government-financed&#13;
programs and to offset problems to the degree possible through equalization&#13;
grants or similar devices. Under this project, the CEF program will employ a&#13;
sliding scale for matching grants (with a cap on grants), so that poorer schools&#13;
get a higher match than do richer schools, and the GSES program will target&#13;
girls from poor families. Yet Tanzania currently has no capability to distinguish&#13;
poverty indicators below the regional level, and certainly not at the school or&#13;
household level. Therefore, the project will finance a welfare monitoring&#13;
capability with the narrow focus of creating a database to guide, and to evaluate&#13;
the impact of, the targeting criteria to be used in the CEF and GSES pilots.&#13;
Even with this narrow focus, the effort will naturally provide all of the data&#13;
necessary for welfare monitoring, and the data will be made widely available for&#13;
that purpose.&#13;
42.   Education Sector Development Program: As an element of the SDP,&#13;
the project will provide resources to support high priority studies needed for&#13;
further development and implementation of the Basic Education Master Plan and&#13;
the Secondary Education Master Plan (United Republic of Tanzania, 1997a and&#13;
1997b). Financing by IDA is intended for work for which financing is not&#13;
available from the Borrower or other donors. Use of IDA funds for these&#13;
purposes will be reviewed and agreed annually by agencies involved in the SDP,&#13;
using the mechanisms proposed in the MOEC's proposals in April 1997 on SDP&#13;
management and design (or as subsequently modified by the Government).&#13;
PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
43.   A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are summarized in&#13;
Table 6. The total cost of the project is estimated at $24.0 million equivalent,&#13;
composed of IDA's contribution, the government's incremental contribution for&#13;
primary schooling, and parents' (or beneficiaries') cash contributions required&#13;
by the project. Parental contributions to support CEF schools are voluntary, but&#13;
in the context of this program, they are a substitute for the lack of local taxes to&#13;
support primary education that otherwise might be tapped.&#13;
44.   Project costs include contingency allowances over the life of the project&#13;
of $0.5 million for inflation (estimated at 4 percent annually in dollar terms)&#13;
applied to base costs after the first year to all elements other than to the CEF&#13;
matching grants; $0.2 million equivalent to compensate for possible&#13;
underestimation of community contributions (this is arbitrarily set at 5 percent of&#13;
the estimated value of the grants); and $0.2 million equivalent for 5 percent&#13;
higher enrollments than are anticipated at the primary school level. The number&#13;
of CEF schools and girls supported each year, and the size of the matching&#13;
grants and bursaries, can also be adjusted to match actual expenditures to&#13;
available funds, based on yearly revised estimates of the costs.&#13;

Tanzania Human Resource Development Piot Project                        17&#13;
45.   Project costs include an estimated $1.5 million equivalent for duties and&#13;
taxes. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at $4.0 million equivalent, or about&#13;
19 percent of total project cost, including contingencies.&#13;
46.   The proposed credit of $20.9 million will finance about 87 percent of&#13;
total project costs,&#13;
including 100                  Table 6. Project Financing Plan&#13;

community development (specifically, the strengthening of local primary&#13;
schools), district-based training to support local schools, targeting of poorer&#13;
beneficiaries who primarily live in rural areas, and increasing gender equity in&#13;
access to secondary education. There is simply not much scope for foreign costs&#13;
in any of these areas.&#13;
47.   In addition, the project will be financed by: (a) a government&#13;
contribution estimated at $1.0 million; (b) beneficiaries' cash contributions of&#13;
$2.1 million, in addition to unmeasured opportunity costs borne by parents and&#13;
students, due to incremental increases in enrollments and retention rates caused&#13;
by the project. No co-financing is anticipated, although as indicated in the&#13;
project description, coordinated parallel financing by other donors is anticipated&#13;
(see Table 6). The Government contribution is primarily the estimated&#13;
contribution of local authorities to the CEF and is assumed to offset dollar-for-&#13;
dollar parental contributions. These are expected to be minimal estimates of&#13;
local financing, based on the matching formula and estimated coverage of the&#13;
CEF.&#13;

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Duration of the Project&#13;
48.   This is estimated to be an 8-year project, to be implemented over 9 fiscal&#13;
years (starting by December 31, 1997, with the project accounts closing by&#13;
December 31, 2005). The project will span 8 school years, from 1998 through&#13;
2005. Table 7 shows the timing. The core of the project will be completed&#13;

during the first three years, but the GSES component will continue until the&#13;
intake of girls beginning secondary school in January 2000 complete their "O"&#13;
levels and the 20 percent of those girls going on to upper secondary school&#13;
complete their "A" levels by December 2005 (which would be halfway through&#13;
their final school year). Major decisions about the results of the pilot and&#13;
follow-on steps will be made in the context of the midterm review near the end&#13;
of the second year.&#13;
Design and Pre-Test&#13;
49.   In January 1995, MOEC advertised locally for consultants to prepare the&#13;
design of the CEF and the GSES components. The work began in March 1995&#13;
with technical assistance by IDA staff and short-term consultants. By June&#13;
1995, feasible designs had been prepared and vetted. The consultants set out to&#13;
pre-test the CEF proposal in 4 schools beginning in August 1995, to find out&#13;
whether it could be implemented successfully. This pre-test was expanded to 30&#13;
schools in 1996 and to an additional 135 schools in 1997. Similarly, the GSES&#13;
proposal was pre-tested beginning with 392 girls in 1996 and expanded to 733&#13;
girls in 1997 (netting out 23 who dropped out of the program in the second&#13;
year). The design, documentation, training program, and procedures have been&#13;
revised in light of the experience each year of the pre-test.&#13;
50.   Both pre-tests were reviewed by a professional educator, Professor S.&#13;
Sumra of the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM), in 1996. Professor Surnra's&#13;
reviews suggested that the designs were substantially reaching the goals of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Tanzania Human Resource Development Pilot Ptoject                    19&#13;
programs but that a number of changes were merited to either simplify them or&#13;
to heighten their impacts.9 The recommended changes will be considered in&#13;
mid-1997 for the 1998 school year (beginning in January), which will be the first&#13;
year supported by the proposed credit.&#13;
Institutional Responsibilities&#13;
51.   As part of the MOEC-led SDP, these pilot activities will be overseen by&#13;
the inter-ministerial Education Sector Coordinating Committee (ESCC) and a&#13;
Special Girls' Education Advisory Group. The pilots will be implemented by a&#13;
MOEC-based Pilot Support Group (PSG) composed of a Project Director;&#13;
coordinators for the CEF, GSES, and capacity building/policy components; and&#13;
support staff within the MOEC. Administrative arrangements will follow&#13;
Government of Tanzania regulations and policies within the framework of donor&#13;
coordination under the SDP.&#13;
52.   Technical support will be provided by the Directorates of Primary and&#13;
Secondary Education. Primary schools, under the supervision of village&#13;
councils and school committees, will be responsible for implementing the CEF&#13;
in their communities and for some monitoring and evaluation responsibilities.&#13;
Primary school teachers, school committees, and village councils will be&#13;
responsible for the selection of GSES scholarship candidates. Secondary&#13;
schools (government and non-government) will manage each girl's schooling&#13;
once she is enrolled, will take some responsibility for non-tuition funds made&#13;
available for each girl, and will have responsibilities for monitoring and&#13;
evaluation. District Education Officers will be responsible for oversight of all&#13;
pilot activities in their districts. Ward Education Coordinators will be&#13;
responsible for supporting pilot activities in their wards. Parents will be fully&#13;
engaged in all elements of both pilots.&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
53.   Project Implementation Plans have been prepared for the CEF, GSES,&#13;
and Monitoring and Evaluation. Procurement of the science kits is at the award&#13;
stage. A needs assessment of proposed procurements for strengthening NECTA&#13;
and the MOEC statistics section have been prepared. Studies for policy and&#13;
strategy have been proposed as part of the Basic Education Master Plan. A work&#13;
program for the welfare monitoring survey has not yet been developed.&#13;
Following negotiations, when all elements of the project are agreed, these plans&#13;
will be compiled and made consistent with one another, along with operational&#13;
9 The reviews are available in the project file.&#13;
0 The design phase has been financed by the EPRP first as a research/project preparation activity. The&#13;
credit was restructured in June 1996, in part to finance the expansion of the pre-tests through February,&#13;
1997.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

procedures for the project, into the project's Operations Manual, to be completed&#13;
by credit effectiveness, expected by December 31, 1997.&#13;
54.  Implementation will be the responsibility of the MOEC's PSG, led by&#13;
the pilot director and the individuals responsible for each component, with&#13;
support from other staff in the MOEC and PMO. The Operations Manual and its&#13;
component implementation plans will be revisited each year and revised to&#13;
reflect best practice, ideas for simplifying implementation, and problems that&#13;
have been overcome. At the PSG's choice, more than one approach to&#13;
implementation for each part of the project will be encouraged, and the team is&#13;
expected to constantly search for more cost-effective ways to implement the&#13;
programs. The PSG's primary goal will be to maximize the amount of money&#13;
directly benefiting primary schools and the bursary girls; in other words,&#13;
minimizing the proportion of funds spent on overhead and implementation costs.&#13;
55.   Within this context, (a) development objectives and a limited set of key&#13;
performance indicators will provide the overall framework for measuring project&#13;
performance; (b) annual work plans by project managers will provide the basis&#13;
for annual resource allocations and monitoring; (c) the central monitoring&#13;
mechanism will be the review of progress reports covering enrollments, pupil&#13;
performance, client satisfaction and expenditures; (d) interim reviews will assess&#13;
progress against work plans, budgets, and recommendations of supervision&#13;
missions; and (e) the pilot will entail a phased incremental expansion on the&#13;
basis of project performance. Performance reviews will be built up from the&#13;
school level, in which school performance will be monitored against school&#13;
plans by parents and project managers. Schools will be held to performance&#13;
targets, with memoranda of understanding in the CEF drawn up between the&#13;
school and MOEC, and in GSES, between the girl, schools, parents, and MOEC.&#13;
Disbursements may proceed slower or faster than planned, depending on the&#13;
program's performance during the previous year.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
56.   Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 8. About 53 percent&#13;
of the procurement under the project will be at the school/community level for&#13;
the CEF and GSES programs. Employment of consultants to undertake training&#13;
in support of these two programs as well as to perform policy studies,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation, and other services in support of the capacity building&#13;
and policy components is expected to account for 23 percent. Procurement of&#13;
goods, including science equipment, vehicles, and computers at the central&#13;
government level, will account for about 13 percent.&#13;

Program&#13;
57.   Operational Guidelines have been developed for both components&#13;
including rules for procurement and disbursement. These rules have already&#13;
been revised twice as part of the pre-tests and for the most part have resulted in&#13;
successful procurement for the primary schools and the girls supported by the&#13;
scholarship program. Contracts for implementation of the CEF and the GSES&#13;
program will be many and of small value. For the CEF, the average annual&#13;
grant to each school is estimated to be less than US$4,000. This sum will be&#13;
used by the school to purchase a number of goods and services including school&#13;
supplies, furniture, equipment, construction materials, and small contracts for&#13;
works." The nature of the goods or works that will be procured will be&#13;
determined during implementation. In the GSES, some funds, considerably less&#13;
than US$100 per girl, may be used for the purchase of books, uniforms,&#13;
transportation, tutoring, and other education inputs.&#13;
Parents may choose to use some of the CEF to finance salary supplements for teachers. For accounting&#13;
purposes, we will assume that such payments come from parental contributions and not from the IDA-&#13;
financed contribution. Salary supplements are expected to be a minor part of what schools finance with&#13;
the CEF and will be monitored during supervision.&#13;

58.   Given the nature of the procurement, the small sizes of the contracts, and&#13;
the wide dispersion of the ultimate users of the funds, packaging of procurement&#13;
contracts will be difficult and may have a negative impact on community&#13;
participation and ownership. Therefore procurement will be handled and&#13;
managed by head teachers and school committees to enhance community&#13;
ownership; to ensure that the goods, works, and services are procured in a timely&#13;
fashion; to permit the use of funds for diverse needs as determined by the&#13;
teachers and parents themselves; and to permit development of grassroots&#13;
artisans. However, a number of measures will be taken to ensure economic and&#13;
efficient procurement.&#13;
a.    FinancialAccountability for Procurement. CEF schools&#13;
and GSES girls/schools will follow a basic accounting&#13;
system detailed in the Handbook for Primary Schools.&#13;
b.    Procurement Planning at the SchooL In the CEF, the&#13;
management of each participating school (typically led by&#13;
the head teacher and the School Committee) will prepare&#13;
a school plan that will be discussed with the School&#13;
Committee and endorsed by the Village/Ward council.&#13;
As part of preparing the school plan, a procurement plan&#13;
will be developed in which the goods or works to be&#13;
procured and the estimated costs for each item will be&#13;
listed. This procurement plan will be attached to the CEF&#13;
grant application to be forwarded to the MOEC (or its&#13;
agent). The MOEC and the school will enter into a&#13;
standard Memorandum of Understanding, of which the&#13;
school plan and procurement plan will be a part,&#13;
governing the use of IDA-financed matching funds. The&#13;
MOEC will check on the eligibility of the proposed&#13;
expenditures before transferring funds to the school&#13;
account. Schools will be required to post the procurement&#13;
plans as part of the process of seeking competitive bids&#13;
locally.&#13;
c.   Information Assistance on Procurement. To ensure&#13;
economy of costs, the MOEC has prepared a catalogue&#13;
with reference prices for a list of goods that primary&#13;
schools are likely to procure. It contains prices, terms,&#13;
and conditions applicable to purchasing from the quoted&#13;
suppliers. The catalogue will be distributed to each&#13;
school participating in the CEF to assist the schools to&#13;
understand what goods are available and at what prices.&#13;
The catalogue will be updated and distributed annually.&#13;

Tanzanua Humam Resource Development Pilot Project               23&#13;
d.    Transparency in the Process of Procurement. Under the&#13;
CEF component, beneficiaries will contribute no less than&#13;
about 33 percent of the cost of the items being procured,&#13;
depending on the poverty rating of the community. The&#13;
MOEC will transfer matching funds to schools only after&#13;
the DEO has verified documentary evidence that&#13;
household contributions have been deposited in an&#13;
account with a commercial bank (or another satisfactory&#13;
arrangement on an exceptional basis when such banking&#13;
of funds is impossible, such as managing funds at the&#13;
district level by the DEO). The parents' personal stake in&#13;
ensuring that the funds are used properly is high, because&#13;
the IDA-financed matching grant is commingled with&#13;
parental contributions, and the pre-tests show so far that&#13;
they monitor the use of these funds closely. This built-in&#13;
assurance and pressure from the parents does not&#13;
necessarily guarantee economic use of funds, but it is&#13;
expected to be a strong deterrent to the un-economic use&#13;
of funds. Moreover, parents will be required initially to&#13;
contribute only half of their annual pledge. When these&#13;
initial funds have been disbursed, the school must come&#13;
back to the parents and report progress with the initial&#13;
funds relative to the posted procurement plan. If parents&#13;
are not happy with the use of their contributions or with&#13;
progress against the plan, they have the option at that&#13;
point not to risk more of their funds, at which point IDA's&#13;
financing of the matching grants will also stop, as there&#13;
will be nothing to match. The MOEC will provide&#13;
assistance to schools to solve the problems that caused the&#13;
cessation of parental contributions.&#13;
59.   For the GSES, procurement includes selection of a school for each girl&#13;
and responsibility for procuring necessary additional items for the girls, such as&#13;
textbooks and school supplies. Detailed procedures and simplified documents&#13;
governing procurement are part of the Operations Manual and are reflected in&#13;
the implementation plan for this component. Most procurement takes place&#13;
when the girls begin school, in January/February each year, when 75 percent of&#13;
the fees under the school's joining instructions is paid. A separate financial log&#13;
is maintained by the school for each girl. This log is reviewed every six months&#13;
to determine whether expenditures are eligible. At the beginning of the second&#13;
term, the remaining 25 percent of the bursary is transferred to the school if&#13;
eligibility criteria are met.&#13;
60.   Procurement under the GSES has two components. First, for tuition, the&#13;
value of the scholarship is determined by the "joining instructions" that are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                                                Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
customarily sent to all prospective students just prior to the start of the school&#13;
year. Tuition and fees are thus determined outside the program and will&#13;
generally be the same for all students. The bursary program will only finance&#13;
the fees that students normally pay. Second, savings from tuition can be used&#13;
through agreement between the girls and their schools to purchase other&#13;
necessary inputs for the girl on the local market. These will be extremely small&#13;
retail purchases. A Memorandum of Understanding between the school and the&#13;
GSES program and between the girl and her village govern the use of these&#13;
funds. Experience with this arrangement during the pre-test has been generally&#13;
good, although mixed. Continued participation by a secondary school in the&#13;
program will be partially dependent on how well these funds are managed on&#13;
behalf of the bursary girl.&#13;
61.   Recognizing the school- and community-based nature of procurement&#13;
under these two programs, the Borrower will conduct procurement audits and&#13;
assessments at each school each year and will provide feedback to the CEF and&#13;
GSES beneficiaries on best practice for improving procurement. These audits&#13;
will also be used during the annual review and revision of the programs'&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
Procurement of Goods and Works for Other Aspects of the Project&#13;
62.   Goods and works will be procured in accordance with the provisions of&#13;
Section I of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits" published by the Bank in January 1995 and revised in January and&#13;
August 1996 (the Guidelines). Because no large-scale works are expected to be&#13;
completed during this project, most of the procurement outside of the CEF and&#13;
GSES will be for goods.&#13;
63.  Procedures. It is expected that of $3.37 million for goods to be financed&#13;
by IDA will be procured under contracts awarded through International&#13;
Competitive Bidding, in accordance with the provisions of Section 11 of the&#13;
Guidelines and paragraph 5 of Appendix I thereto, primarily for science&#13;
equipment, computers, and scanning devices. Exceptions are as follows:&#13;
a.    National Competitive Bidding may be considered for&#13;
goods and works estimated to cost less than $100,000&#13;
equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to&#13;
exceed $500,000 equivalent, which may be procured&#13;
under contracts awarded in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 of the Guidelines.&#13;
b.    Computers, office equipment and vehicles estimated to&#13;
cost less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) equivalent&#13;
per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed&#13;
three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) equivalent may&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Twaizana Human Resource Development Pdlot Project                           25&#13;
be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
international shopping procedures in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of paragraphs 3.5 and 3.6 of the Guidelines.&#13;
c.     Computers, office equipment and vehicles estimated to&#13;
cost less than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000)&#13;
equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to&#13;
exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000)&#13;
equivalent may be procured under contracts awarded on&#13;
the basis of national shopping procedures in accordance&#13;
with the provisions of paragraphs 3.5 and 3.6 of the&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
d.     Computers, office equipment and vehicles estimated to&#13;
cost less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) equivalent&#13;
per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed&#13;
three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) equivalent may&#13;
be procured from the United Nations Inter-Agency&#13;
Procurement Services Office (IAPSO) in accordance with&#13;
the provisions of paragraph 3.9 of the Guidelines.&#13;
Procurement from IAPSO should be limited to those&#13;
instances when items are urgently needed.&#13;
e.     If the need for a limited number of small force account&#13;
works (which is not anticipated at this time) arises due to&#13;
a lack of local contractors (e.g., if CEF schools must&#13;
contract with the Ministry of Works for construction),&#13;
these works will be carried out in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of paragraph 3.8 of the Guidelines. The&#13;
aggregate cost of force account works is not expected to&#13;
exceed $200,000.&#13;
64.   Planning. Prior to initiating any procurement activities, the Government&#13;
will prepare a procurement plan for the project that will be furnished to IDA for&#13;
its review and approval.12 Procurement of all goods will follow this&#13;
procurement plan as approved by IDA, and with the provisions of paragraph 1 of&#13;
Appendix I to the Guidelines. A General Procurement Notice listing all&#13;
procurement shown in the plan will be published in accordance with paragraph&#13;
2.7 of the Guidelines.&#13;
12 Apart from small scale procurement for the CEF and GSES, and some equipment for the PSG,&#13;
procurement in the first year will be limited to science kits for secondary schools, which is currently at&#13;
the award stage. Procurement in subsequent years by the central government to strengthen NECTA and&#13;
the MOEC statistics section will be the result of small scale testing of the planned technologies during&#13;
the first year, following which MOEC's proposal for proceeding (including the procurement plan) will&#13;
be produced.&#13;
&#13;

65.   Prior Review. With respect to each contract for International&#13;
Competitive Bidding estimated to cost the equivalent of $100,000 or more, prior&#13;
review by IDA will be required, and the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and&#13;
3 of Appendix I to the Guidelines will apply. For each contract to be awarded&#13;
under Shopping estimated to cost the equivalent of $25,000 or more, the&#13;
following procedures will apply: (a) prior to the selection of any supplier under&#13;
shopping procedures the Government will provide to IDA a report on the&#13;
comparison and evaluation of quotations received; (b) prior to the execution of&#13;
any contract procured under direct contracting or shopping procedures, the&#13;
Government will provide to IDA a copy of the draft contract; (c) in addition, the&#13;
procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 (f) and 2 (g) and 3 of Appendix I to the&#13;
Guidelines will apply. The first three contracts for goods or works, irrespective&#13;
of contract value or purpose, will be subject to prior review by IDA.&#13;
66.   Post Review. All other contracts will be subject to post review during&#13;
supervision missions.&#13;
Consultants' Services&#13;
67. Quality- and Cost-Based Selection. An estimated $4.39 million will be&#13;
disbursed for consultants' services. For consulting contracts in excess of&#13;
$100,000 equivalent, consultants will be selected in accordance with the&#13;
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers" published by the Bank in January 1997 (the Consultant Guidelines).&#13;
The fundamental procedure to be followed is called Quality-and Cost-Based&#13;
Selection, which requires the Government to solicit proposals composed of a&#13;
technical proposal and a financial proposal. The technical proposals are&#13;
evaluated first according to criteria set forth in the letter of invitation to bid, then&#13;
the financial proposals are opened and incorporated into the rating process as set&#13;
forth in the letter of invitation. Cost is always a factor in the award. Short lists&#13;
for consultancy services estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract may comprise entirely national consultants.&#13;
68.   Other Proceduresfor the Selection of Consultants. The following&#13;
selection methods may be used in specific cases, as indicated: (a) Selection&#13;
Under a Fixed Budget Services for assistance to districts, schools, and&#13;
communities in training to implement the CEF and GSES programs may be&#13;
procured under contracts awarded in accordance with the provisions of&#13;
paragraphs 3.1 and 3.5 of the Consultant Guidelines; (b) Least-Cost Selection&#13;
Services for standard, well defined auditing and accounting tasks for all parts of&#13;
the project estimated to cost less than $50,000 equivalent per contract may be&#13;
procured under contracts awarded in accordance with the provisions of&#13;
paragraphs 3.1 and 3.6 of the Consultant Guidelines; (c) Individual Consultants&#13;
Services for training, monitoring, evaluation, policy studies, financial&#13;
management, project management, and surveys under all parts of the Project that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Tanania Human Resource Development Piot Project                  27&#13;
meet the requirements set forth in paragraph 5.01 of the Consultant Guidelines&#13;
may be procured under contracts awarded to individual consultants in&#13;
accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 5.1 through 5.3 of the Consultant&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
69.   Prior Review. Prior review by IDA will be required for consulting&#13;
contracts with firms of $50,000 or more and with individuals of $20,000 or&#13;
more. For contracts with firms between $50,000 and $100,000, IDA must be&#13;
notified of the results of the technical evaluation prior to opening the financial&#13;
proposals. For contracts with firms above $100,000, IDA must be furnished&#13;
with the technical evaluation report and given sufficient time to review it before&#13;
opening the financial proposals. These procedures are explained in Appendix 1&#13;
of the Guidelines.&#13;
70.   Post Review. All contracts for consultants' services that are not subject&#13;
to prior review will be subject to post review during supervision missions.&#13;
Disbursement                        Table 9. IDA Disbursement Plan&#13;
71.   The disbursement plan for    Fiscal Year  Annual  Cumulative&#13;
IDA financing is shown in Table 9.  FY978199     4.523     27.5&#13;
The project is expected to be       FY99900      4.89      11.94&#13;

72.   The Government will open,       Total      20.86&#13;
and the Pilot Support Group (PSG)&#13;
under MOEC will operate, two Special Accounts. The Project Coordinator and&#13;
the Accountant will be the signatories to the Special Accounts. One Special&#13;
Account will be used to fund matching grants and bursaries; the other will fund&#13;
all other project expenses. IDA will deposit US $1.7 million in the grants and&#13;
bursaries Special Account, estimated to be equivalent to at least six months of&#13;
expected expenditures. The Special Account for all other expenses will be&#13;
funded with $0.5 million-sufficient to fund approximately three months of these&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
73.   This project will use existing government systems to make timely&#13;
disbursements. The PSG will provide an advance to the Ministry of Finance&#13;
sufficient to fund six months of CEF matching grants to primary schools. If&#13;
matching grant expenditures are captured in the districts' budgets, the Ministry&#13;
of Finance will use these funds to provide advances to the DEOs in each&#13;
participating district. If the matching grant expenditures are captured in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                                                Staff Appraal Report&#13;
MOEC's budget, the Ministry of Finance will provide an advance to MOEC&#13;
which will provide advances to the DEOs in each participating district. DEOs&#13;
will use their advances to provide matching grants to primary schools. They&#13;
will keep track of the amount received by each school and account for&#13;
expenditures to the PSG on a bi-annual basis or whenever they apply for an&#13;
advance replenishment, whichever comes first. Districts can receive two CEF&#13;
advances each year.&#13;
74.   The districts will make matching grants to schools upon acceptance of a&#13;
school plan, a memorandum of understanding, a bank statement indicating that&#13;
funds from the parents have been collected and deposited in the school's bank&#13;
account, and a statement of expenditures from previous grants. Districts will&#13;
account for matching grants made to primary schools by providing Statements of&#13;
Expenditure (SOEs) to the PSG that will include the amnount that each school&#13;
received, the date funds were disbursed, and the telegraphic transfer number of&#13;
each disbursement. Because schools have the opportunity to obtain six&#13;
matching grants over the course of the program, parental willingness to make&#13;
subsequent contributions will be the best indicator MOEC could have that&#13;
previously-supplied matching funds were well spent. Based on year-end audits,&#13;
this process will be re-evaluated and improved each year.&#13;
75.  In the first year of the program, the PSG will transfer GSES bursaries&#13;
from the Special Account to participating secondary schools. Beginning in the&#13;
second year of the program, funds will flow from the Special Account through&#13;
the Ministry of Finance to districts as they will flow for the CEF. Before the&#13;
beginning of each school semester, districts will disburse appropriate funds to&#13;
each secondary school that bursary recipients from their district are attending.&#13;
Funds will be disbursed to secondary schools based on a Memorandum of&#13;
Understanding in which secondary schools pledge to provide specified&#13;
education-related services and supplies, and pocket money to participating girls.&#13;
From the second school semester onwards, schools will also supply a summary&#13;
certificate of performance. Districts will keep track of the amount paid to each&#13;
secondary school and account for each semester's expenditures three months&#13;
before the start of the following semester. Districts' SOEs will provide&#13;
information to the PSG on the amount that each school received, the date funds&#13;
were disbursed, the telegraphic transfer number of each disbursement, and the&#13;
names of the girls attending each school. Based on year-end audits, this process&#13;
will be re-evaluated and improved each year.&#13;
76.   Expenditures for contracts for individual consultant services not exceeding&#13;
US$10,000 and for all other contracts not exceeding US$50,000 will be claimed&#13;
on the basis of statements of expenditures. All other expenditures in excess of&#13;
these amounts will be fully documented when submitted to IDA for disbursement.&#13;
Replenishment applications for the matching grant and bursary Special Account&#13;
will be submitted at least every three months. Replenishment applications for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Tanzania Human Resource Development Plot Project                29&#13;
Special Account funding all other expenditures will be submitted every month.&#13;
Replenishment applications and supporting documentation will be provided to&#13;
IDA irrespective of the volume of transactions during each month. All&#13;
documentation supporting SOEs will be available at the MOEC to facilitate&#13;
inspection by IDA supervision missions.&#13;
Accounting and Auditing&#13;
77.   The MOEC will maintain accounts for the project. It will produce&#13;
quarterly and annual financial statements that will be submitted to the ESCC.&#13;
Copies will also be sent to IDA. Accounts will be maintained in accordance&#13;
with International Accounting Standards (IAS) on a PC-based accounting&#13;
program. To facilitate production of financial information in a manner that will&#13;
allow it to be linked to technical and operational data, a Management&#13;
Information System will be developed in a manner that will permit full&#13;
integration of accounting information. An effective accounting and management&#13;
information system will be necessary for schools and districts that join the pilot,&#13;
and systems both at the district and central levels will be improved over the life&#13;
of the project. Part of the impact of the pilot will be the development of simple&#13;
but effective systems to support decentralization of financial and management&#13;
decisions, consistent with the overall SDP framework for donor-funded projects.&#13;
78.   The annual financial statements of the project will be audited in&#13;
accordance with International Standards of Auditing by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA. The audited financial statements, with the auditor's report&#13;
thereon, and the auditor's management letter, covering internal control and&#13;
accounting procedures weaknesses discovered as a result of the audit, will be&#13;
sent to IDA within six months of the end of the period audited. The MOEC will&#13;
submit to IDA copies of its quarterly and annual financial reports.&#13;
79.   At the community level, all accounts will be maintained by head teachers&#13;
and school committees and available for inspection by MOEC or its authorized&#13;
representatives. The training materials contain guidance on accounting and&#13;
simple bookkeeping that will be cleared with accounting specialists within IDA,&#13;
which will also be stated in the operational manual.&#13;

81.   The MOEC and IDA in collaboration with other donor agencies (through&#13;
the Education Sector Management Group and the ES CC) will conduct joint&#13;
project implementation reviews at least annually. These evaluation will&#13;
determine whether program modifications should be made each year and what&#13;
form they will take. A comprehensive midterm review will take place within 20&#13;
months of the start of the project (approximately September 1999). IDA plans&#13;
two supervision missions annually whose timing coordinated with the&#13;
production of interim monitoring reports.&#13;
LESSONs LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS BANK/IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
82.   The Bank Group has financed eight projects in the education sector in&#13;
Tanzania, beginning in the 1960s. A review of this portfolio provided lessons&#13;
for design and implementation of this project:&#13;
Low Disbursement Levels&#13;
83.   Despite large projects (up to US$38 million), the amount of annual&#13;
disbursements to education was small, on a maximum scale of $2-3 million&#13;
annually. In contrast, HRDP is designed to make it feasible to reach a higher&#13;
level of IDA disbursements by unbundling bulky central disbursements for&#13;
works and equipment, attracting other funds into primary schools, moving&#13;
smaller decisions down through the chain to the school level (where there is an&#13;
incentive to identify the most important investments, undertake them without&#13;
delay, and minimize costs, as the parents are also contributing to the resources).&#13;
IDA's previous annual disbursement performance in support of education is&#13;
expected to be exceeded under HRDP by just the direct grants to primary&#13;
schools and girls. IDA disbursements will leverage additional community&#13;
resources for primary education through the device of the matching grant.&#13;
Administrative Complexity&#13;
84.   All of the projects were too complex, with too many implementing&#13;
agencies and too many components. Despite the fact that each project&#13;
evaluation noted that the complexity had hampered implementation, each&#13;
subsequent project was even more complex. The current Bank-supported&#13;
operation (Cr. 2137-TA) is perhaps the most complex, with three loosely related&#13;
components, 13 sub-components, 3 management units, and at least 9 separate&#13;
implementing organizations or units. It supports centrally-planned primary and&#13;
secondary education with inputs of training, textbooks, civil works and technical&#13;
assistance. In the design of HRDP, the Government and IDA have responded by&#13;
reducing the number of components, assuring that they are complementary, and&#13;
focusing on a limited number of high-impact activities. Feasibility of&#13;
implementing the pilots has been confirmed through pre-testing, and high&#13;
priority areas for capacity building have been identified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32                                                Staff Apprisal Report&#13;
Inadequate Participation&#13;
85.   Project design and implementation was centralized, with little&#13;
opportunity for the ultimate beneficiaries to influence the way the funds were&#13;
spent. HRDP explicitly attempts to push decision-making authority and&#13;
resources as close to the final user as possible and places much of the&#13;
responsibility for monitoring performance at that level. The project supports&#13;
instruments to increase the information available at all levels to make better&#13;
decisions-about school plans, school procurement, prices and availability of&#13;
inputs, secondary schools, test results, and school performance. Implementation&#13;
of the project will include repeated consultations with beneficiaries and local&#13;
implementers.&#13;
Unmanageable Recurrent Costs&#13;
86.   The World Bank and the government were unsuccessful in responding to&#13;
the recurrent cost demands associated with the project investments. Many of the&#13;
capital investments made in the past have depreciated dramatically due to lack of&#13;
maintenance, lack of recurrent budget support, and lack of local ownership of&#13;
assets. In the CEF, IDA investments are not made unless localities identify their&#13;
education needs and put up some of their own funds to co-finance the&#13;
investment. For girls, the investment is in their human capital, with a long-&#13;
lasting stream of benefits generated for the girls and for society. Although there&#13;
is no cost-sharing with parents under the bursary program, the parents incur&#13;
substantial losses of non-market productivity from the girls to send them to&#13;
school. There are no future recurrent costs to government generated from the&#13;
investments in the girls; in fact, in the long run, these investments should reduce&#13;
demands on the recurrent budget by reducing population pressure on social&#13;
expenditures.&#13;
RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
87.   The central theme of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for&#13;
Tanzania (World Bank 1997b, dated May 7, 1997, and discussed by the Board&#13;
on June 20, 1997) is poverty alleviation through economic growth and human&#13;
development. One of the five principal objectives of the CAS is to "Stabilize&#13;
and then reverse the downward trend in the social indicators through measures&#13;
that decentralize responsibility, increase local resource mobilization and&#13;
rationalize expenditures. In the education sector, there is a need for containing&#13;
expenditure on staff and raising the outlay on other inputs; increasing the&#13;
efficiency of expenditure of public sector secondary education; and providing&#13;
added incentives for greater involvement of the private sector in secondary as&#13;
well as tertiary education. The target gross enrollment rate for primary&#13;
education should be at least 85 percent by the year 2000." This project is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Tanzwu Human Resource Development Pilot Project                 33&#13;
specifically oriented to help the government find an effective community-based&#13;
mechanism to achieve these goals in primary and secondary education. Coupled&#13;
with education sector conditionalities in the Structural Adjustment Credit&#13;
(World Bank 1997a) and another operation currently being prepared to&#13;
strengthen and rationalize higher education (TZ-PE-2806), IDA will soon have&#13;
three powerful instruments to help the government achieve this CAS objective.&#13;
Economic and Sector Work: Analytical Underpinnings&#13;
88.   Public Expenditure Reviews in 1993 and 1997 found substantial under-&#13;
spending by the government in primary education relative to the cost of a&#13;
minimally effective combination of inputs. Despite the government's best&#13;
efforts to protect basic education, the severity of budget cuts precipitated by&#13;
shortfalls in revenue and debt obligations during the last two budget cycles have&#13;
led to a further deterioration in the quality of basic education. Current estimates&#13;
suggest that the central government will have great difficulty keeping per capita&#13;
education expenditures from falling for the foreseeable future because of limited&#13;
prospects for revenue growth coupled with a high population growth rate. In&#13;
addition, the Social Sector Review demonstrated that the incidence of public&#13;
expenditures on health and education are skewed toward the richer segments of&#13;
the population in Tanzania, except for basic services (only about half of the&#13;
education budget has gone to primary education in the 1 990s). The Poverty&#13;
Profile (World Bank 1994) and the Country Economic Memorandum/Poverty&#13;
Assessment (World Bank 1996) demonstrate that one of the main factors&#13;
implicated in the increasingly skewed distribution of income in Tanzania is&#13;
ownership of human capital in the form of primary education and, especially,&#13;
secondary and higher education. This situation is due largely to the high returns&#13;
to education coupled with the highly variable quality of primary education, and&#13;
to past policies that rationed access to secondary and higher education.&#13;
Unique IDA Contributions&#13;
89.   One serious problem the Government has faced in trying to address long-&#13;
standing problems in the education sector has been the tight overall budget&#13;
constraint and lack of room for maneuver in budgets that are dominated by&#13;
salaries (91 percent for primary and 91 percent of non-boarding costs for&#13;
secondary). IDA's unique contribution in this situation is the ability to reduce&#13;
risks and improve the quality of possible policy changes by supplying low-cost&#13;
funds to test potential solutions to Tanzania's most pressing education sector&#13;
problems. The IDA funds will allow MOEC to avoid disturbing the existing&#13;
system, other donor programs, or its sector-wide initiative, recognizing that if&#13;
the pilots turn out to be impractical, no harm should be done to the existing&#13;
system. In addition, IDA support will allow the Government to test, then to&#13;
purchase and implement, new technology to improve two fundamental building&#13;
blocks of an effective national educational system, the examinations and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

statistics systems. In addition to the analytical work cited above, IDA's&#13;
technical resources have been instrumental in assisting Tanzania to design both&#13;
the pilots and the monitoring and evaluation program.&#13;
Economic Rationale&#13;
90.   Increasing Tanzanian children's educational attainment is fundamental to&#13;
the country's effort to accelerate economic growth and distribute the benefits of&#13;
that growth throughout the population. Additional schooling for both men and&#13;
women has a significant effect on welfare. For example, simulations done for&#13;
the Poverty Assessment indicate that achieving a rise in the stock of schooling to&#13;
the primary school level for all adults would mean an increase of 22 percent in&#13;
their average adult equivalent expenditure (a proxy for consumption).&#13;

women, but&#13;
especially for women. The per-year estimates in Table 12 correspond to&#13;
approximately a 25 percent return for completing primary and 28 percent for&#13;
completing secondary school. Quasi-social rates of return are also substantial&#13;
for primary and lower secondary (shown in the bottom row of Table 12). The&#13;
social returns to educating girls are expected to be even more striking when non-&#13;
market social benefits are included, such as the impacts on education, health,&#13;
nutritional status, and fertility.&#13;

inequity is caused by the   distributed, each cell would be 20%. The distribution of&#13;
way secondary and       University spending is estimated using a very small sample.&#13;
tertiary places are&#13;
rationed and financed. One way to improve equity in the Tanzanian education&#13;
system is to put more money into primary schools, where the benefits are about&#13;
equally distributed across quintiles. A second way to improve equity is to target&#13;
subsidies for secondary school to those who are too poor to attend, such as poor&#13;
girls. These two interventions are exactly what the CEF and GSES are designed&#13;
to do. For example, we estimate that in districts where the GSES will be piloted,&#13;
the share of subsidies going to the poorest 40 percent of the girls in the&#13;
population will rise from 24 percent today to 65 percent by the end of the pilot.&#13;
Complementarity with Other Donor Agencies' Involvement&#13;
93.   The major donors in education include Denmark (Danida), the European&#13;
Union (EU), Finland (Finida), France, Germany (KFW, GTZ), Ireland (Irish Aid),&#13;
the Netherlands (DGIS), Sweden (SIDA), UNDP, UNESCO, UNICEF, the United&#13;
Kingdom (DfID), World Bank (IDA), and Norway (NORAD). Donors are a small&#13;
factor in the financing of education: they were budgeted to spend Tsh 4,952&#13;
billion, only about 4 percent of all education expenditures in FY94/95. 41 percent&#13;
of these donor funds went to primary education, 44 percent to higher and technical&#13;
education, and only 3 percent to general secondary education. In general, donor&#13;
funds are allocated to technical assistance, construction and rehabilitation of&#13;
facilities, textbooks, equipment, materials, assistance for district planning, and&#13;
training of managers and teachers. Specific donor programs are summarized in&#13;
Annex H.&#13;
94.   The intention under this pilot project is to provide funds to schools and to&#13;
girls in a manner that will be complementary to the technical and financial support&#13;
provided by MOEC and donors to improve teacher quality, textbook availability,&#13;
school maintenance, district education planning, and decentralized management.&#13;
Crudely put, IDA funds for the CEF and GSES represent "demand-side"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                                  Staff Appiwisal Reporl&#13;
interventions; our focus on demand has made feasible by the complementary focus&#13;
of Government and donors on strengthening elements of the supply side. Both&#13;
types of interventions are necessary.&#13;
95.   Supply-side support from IDA under this project for policy studies,&#13;
strategy development, and monitoring and evaluation will be coordinated annually&#13;
by MOEC with other sources of assistance in these areas within the framework&#13;
and institutional setup of the SDP. Allocations for these components have been&#13;
made on the assumption that parallel financing from other donors will become&#13;
available over the life of the project, and IDA's support can be modified annually&#13;
in consultation between the MOEC and its partners. As IDA funds for these&#13;
elements become redundant, the Borrower and IDA agreed at negotiations that&#13;
freed-up funds would be reallocated to the CEF and GSES programs.&#13;
96.   IDA intends to participate in joint donor supervision missions and to be&#13;
sure that all CEF and GSES inputs financed by IDA are complementary to other&#13;
sources of assistance. For example, the CEF program should complement&#13;
Danida/DGIS-funded assistance for district education planning. In a number of&#13;
districts the CEF program already overlaps with assistance from Irish Aid,&#13;
UTNICEF, and Danida/DGIS. Coordination has been far from perfect, but IDA&#13;
will continually encourage the MOEC to coordinate IDA-financed inputs with&#13;
these other complementary programs. SIDA has supplied textbooks, has improved&#13;
the distribution of textbooks and supplies to districts; and plans to focus in the&#13;
future more on what happens in the school. SIDA's inputs can only improve the&#13;
efficacy of the CEF program and vice versa. The BEMP has a broad reform&#13;
agenda in which the CEF or CEF-style school-based programs play a major role,&#13;
with a clear connection to the strengthening of the districts. For the GSES, GTZ&#13;
has a new program to support science education in secondary school, which can be&#13;
coordinated with the bursary program to improve science training for poor girls.&#13;
Assessments&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
97.   This section will assess whether the design can work and whether&#13;
alternative approaches might be preferred. The CEF design is consistent with&#13;
the worldwide movement towards greater decentralization and accountability to&#13;
beneficiaries in education. Matching grants and equalization grants are well&#13;
developed tools to influence local spending and to improve equity in&#13;
decentralized systems. The GSES design uses another well accepted and&#13;
understood financial instrument, scholarships, to target subsidies to a specific,&#13;
disadvantaged group (poor girls). Many alternatives to the CEF and GSES&#13;
designs were considered and rejected because they did not (a) adequately&#13;
encourage community involvement or (b) create substantially different&#13;
alternatives to approaches currently used in Tanzania. Pilot projects should help&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Ta_Atia Human Resource Development Pilot Project                 37&#13;
find new ways to solve persistent problems. Thus this project utilizes&#13;
approaches that differ from current practice, and yet are consistent with the&#13;
government's objective to decentralize management and responsibility.&#13;
98.   During development of the pilots, many concerns have been raised. The&#13;
aide memoire of the appraisal mission, in the project files, examines each of the&#13;
concerns about the design and responds to them. In addition, Professor Suleman&#13;
Sumra (1996) reviewed the CEF pre-test in the first four schools that&#13;
participated in the program and the first year of the GSES (Sumnra et al. 1997).&#13;
Professor Sumra's findings and the conclusions of Merit International Limited,&#13;
the consulting firm contracted to implement the pre-tests, are summarized in&#13;
Annex C and are included in full in the project file.&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
Community Education Fund&#13;
99.   At the political level, self reliance and cost-sharing for social services is&#13;
politically accepted, so the matching fund approach will have political&#13;
legitimacy. The Third Term Government is committed to self-reliance, which&#13;
this project promotes. The Parliamentary Committee for Social Services is&#13;
committed to decentralization and community participation in decision making.&#13;
At the sector level, the project is consistent with the Ministry of Education's&#13;
BEMP and is framed within the SDP. The MOEC commitment to finance the&#13;
design and pre-test of the project is a good indication that it owns the project and&#13;
will continue to support it.&#13;
100.  At the district level, DEOs have the skills to inspect schools and to deal&#13;
with the project's primary education supply side issues. This project will&#13;
provide DEOs with additional resources for primary education in their districts,&#13;
and they will be responsible for the program in their districts. At the community&#13;
level, the ward or village government has a major role to play in approving the&#13;
primary school plan and in choosing girls for the bursary. During the pre-test,&#13;
they have shown considerable flexibility to make the program work but have&#13;
also exercised a fiduciary role in reviewing choices made at the school level. At&#13;
the school level, teachers and school committees have been enthusiastic about&#13;
the project in pre-test districts. This project will encourage school committees to&#13;
become more active because the project augments school-based management&#13;
and community empowerment.&#13;
Girls' Secondary Education Support Program&#13;
101. The project fits in the existing education system and will be executed by&#13;
it. At the political level, parliamentarians are ready to assist in promoting this&#13;
project, and the President has made several statements highlighting his concern&#13;
for the education of girls. At the sector level, the MOEC has Directorates of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                                                 Staff Apraisal Repoit&#13;
Secondary Education, Planning, and Inspectorate. The ESCC will provide&#13;
oversight, and a PSG will be established to manage the bursaries within the&#13;
MOEC. At the district level, the current staff of the DEOs assist primary&#13;
schools to nominate girls for scholarships. They also can circulate necessary&#13;
information to the selected girls, and ensure that girls report to the chosen&#13;
secondary schools.&#13;
102. At the community level, the existing ward and village committees are&#13;
adequate for recommending girls for bursaries. At the school level, primary&#13;
schools need strengthening. The CEF is addressing this problem. It is&#13;
anticipated that as the quality of primary education improves, more girls will&#13;
become eligible to compete for scholarships. Secondary schools will assist the&#13;
chosen girls to purchase necessary school inputs with their bursary funds.&#13;
Overall&#13;
103.  There are auditing capabilities at all levels to adequately monitor this&#13;
project, and they will be improved under the project. With temporary,&#13;
specialized assistance of consultants for training, monitoring and evaluation, and&#13;
analytical work, the government has sufficient institutional capacity and&#13;
personnel to implement the project. Most fundamentally, the pre-tests have&#13;
shown that both the CEF and GSES can work, and communities improve&#13;
substantially their ability to implement the programs within the first few years.&#13;
ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT&#13;
104.  This section summarizes the benefit-cost analysis elaborated in Annex D.&#13;
Benefits used in the analysis are limited to those generated by the CEF and&#13;
GSES, including the pecuniary benefits from future earnings accruing to&#13;
individuals because of increased schooling, reduced repeating of grades, and&#13;
increased school quality. A conservatively estimated monetary equivalent of&#13;
non-pecuniary benefits, including reduced fertility among girls with more&#13;
education, and improved schooling and health prospects for the children of&#13;
primary and secondary school leavers, is also included. These benefits are&#13;
associated with incremental improvements expected to be produced by the CEF&#13;
and GSES.&#13;
105.  Costs include the project's full costs, including those for capacity&#13;
building, policy development, planning, and research. The incremental foregone&#13;
opportunity cost to households of additional children attending school are also&#13;
included.&#13;

the direct costs of parental contributions to the CEF, project contributions of&#13;
matching funds for the CEF, and project funding of bursaries for the GSES are&#13;
considered, the IRR for the Community Education Fund is estimated at 48&#13;
percent; and for the GSES, at 11 percent. With this lower cost structure, the&#13;
return for the project as a whole is estimated at 26 percent (see Table 12).&#13;

Capacity Building or Policy Development, Planning, and Research components,&#13;
treating them only as costs or supporting activities of the CEF and GSES, the&#13;
IRRs in Table 12 should be considered lower-bound estimates. Unless the&#13;
unquantified, independent benefits for these other components are zero or&#13;
negative, the returns to the project can be assumed to be substantially higher&#13;
than estimated.&#13;
108.  This analysis ignores the general positive externalities of a better&#13;
educated population and the positive income distribution implications of the&#13;
project. A large proportion of the new children likely to enroll in primary school&#13;
as a consequence of the CEF will come from low-income, disadvantaged&#13;
backgrounds. All of the estimated 3,415 girls participating in the GSES will&#13;
come from households in the lower one-half of the income distribution.&#13;
109.  This project is a relatively small, pilot effort. Thus the capacity building,&#13;
policy development, planning, and research costs are distributed over a relatively&#13;
small group of beneficiaries. However, the learning curve is steep, and the pre-&#13;
tests have shown that after two years, most of the training costs can be&#13;
eliminated. The IRRs can be increased during implementation if the Borrower is&#13;
successful in moving resources out of administrative and training costs and into&#13;
grants and scholarships, which it is committed to do if possible.&#13;
IDA EXIT STRATEGY&#13;
110. The pilot nature of the project provides an exit for IDA. If the evaluation&#13;
of the pilot is negative, either the Government or IDA can stop financing it. Any&#13;
bureaucracy developed for the pilot will disappear with it. If successful, the&#13;
financial instruments used for the CEF and GSES can be adapted to any chosen&#13;
level of IDA support in the future. For the CEF, if the pilot project succeeds,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

IDA can put conditionalities on future support, such as: (a) the Government&#13;
must move its subsidies out of the existing system and into the CEF and thus&#13;
fully empower schools to manage themselves; and (b) IDA support will continue&#13;
only on an agreed declining path based on district- or school-level poverty&#13;
indices. For the GSES, if the program is a success and continues IDA's&#13;
financing can continue on a declining basis.&#13;
FINANCIAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
111. This section summarizes the financial assessment appearing in Annex E.&#13;
This financial assessment examines the full annual cost of funding primary&#13;
education and operating the project in 2007, when it is assumed that the project&#13;
has a national scope and that all start-up expenses have already been incurred.&#13;
The sustainability of the project under alternative assumptions about growth in&#13;
real incomes is also considered. The analysis is performed under three gross&#13;
enrollment rate scenarios. All figures are in 1996 US dollars.&#13;
Funding Required to Support Primary Education and the Project&#13;
112. In 2007, if Tanzania maintains its current 74 percent primary school&#13;
gross enrollment rate, the full cost of educating all the children in Tanzanian&#13;
primary schools-including the full cost of operating the CEF and the GSES in&#13;
all schools-will be approximately US$261 million. If Tanzania achieves a 90&#13;
percent primary school gross enrollment rate, this cost will rise to approximately&#13;
US$317 million. Finally, if Tanzania achieves a 105 percent primary school&#13;
gross enrollment rate, this cost will be approximately US$371 million. Under&#13;
each scenario, approximately 77 percent of the cost can be attributed to just&#13;
maintaining existing per-pupil expenditures; the remaining 23 percent represents&#13;
the additional funding made available under the CEF and GSES.&#13;
Sustainability of Primary Education and Project Costs&#13;
113. Tanzania's ability to support primary education and the CEF and GSES&#13;
programs by 2007 depends critically on the pattern of real income growth over&#13;
the next 10 years. If gross enrollment rates do not change, Tanzania should be&#13;
able to support primary education and the nationwide roll-out of the CEF and&#13;
GSES programs by 2007 assuming the country experiences at least 1 percent&#13;
annual real growth in incomes over the next 10 years. If Tanzania's gross&#13;
enrollment rate increases to 90 percent by 2007, the country should be able to&#13;
support primary education and the nationwide roll-out of the CEF and GSES&#13;
programs assuming the country experiences at least 3 percent annual real growth&#13;
in incomes over the next 10 years. If Tanzania's gross enrollment rate increases&#13;
to 105 percent by 2007, the country should be able to support primary education&#13;
and the nationwide roll-out of the CEF and GSES programs assuming the&#13;
country experiences at least 3 percent annual real growth in incomes over the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Tanzaua Human Resource Development Pilot Project                       41&#13;
next 10 years and undertakes some education reforms.13 If these conditions are&#13;
not met, this program, combined with continued government support to&#13;
education at its current level of expenditures per pupil, will require either a&#13;
significant increase in education's share of the government's net current&#13;
expenditures and/or substantial additional donor support.&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
114. The project is rated category C, though under the CEF component many&#13;
schools will use the matching grant funds to construct classrooms or latrines.&#13;
None of the activity is foreseen to have a negative impact on the environment in&#13;
the short run. School construction will be monitored by the district authorities,&#13;
who should ensure that national building guidelines for schools are followed.&#13;
115.  In the long run, the project is expected to have a positive impact on the&#13;
environment. Increased education levels will, among other benefits, contribute&#13;
to: (a) lower fertility rates and thus reduce environmental pressures associated&#13;
with rapid population growth; (b) increase the economic capacity of households&#13;
to produce more educated farmers; and (c) produce better-off farners, who will&#13;
be more receptive to learn and undertake land conservation.&#13;
PARICIPATORY APPROACH&#13;
116.  The design of this project was developed through a participatory process&#13;
involving stakeholders at all levels, supervised by a Permanent Secretary-level&#13;
Steering Committee. Identification of the project components is based on&#13;
participatory sector work, the Tanzania Social Sector Review, which included a&#13;
nationally representative household survey, focus groups, and other qualitative&#13;
survey techniques. Project preparation included two rounds of systematic client&#13;
consultation activities with households, implementers, students, teachers, local&#13;
government, and donors. The chronology of participatory activities during&#13;
project development are detailed in Annex F. Local consultants took primary&#13;
responsibility for the design of the pilot project and for client consultations. As&#13;
part of the design process, both the CEF and GSES were pre-tested to get more&#13;
feedback before entering the pilot phase. The design has been repeatedly revised&#13;
in response to the consultations and pre-tests. In addition, participation is fully&#13;
built into the project by empowering clients to control resources, by requiring a&#13;
cash contribution of the beneficiaries, and by strengthening local planning,&#13;
consultation, and feedback mechanisms to improve the design of the project and&#13;
the functioning of the schools.&#13;
13 From 1985-1995, per capita GNP grew by 1 percent annually and GDP grew by about 3.5 percent&#13;
annually. If this growth continues or accelerates, the high-cost scenario could be financed.&#13;
&#13;

BENEFITS&#13;
117. The economic assessment quantifies the main pecuniary and non-&#13;
pecuniary benefits of the CEF and GSES. This section highlights the range of&#13;
benefits that are expected, including some that are ignored in the economic&#13;
assessment.&#13;
Access and Quality of Primary and Secondary Education&#13;
118.- Direct project beneficiaries are estimated to include 400,000 primary&#13;
school students, 3,415 girls who receive bursaries, and other secondary school&#13;
students in the schools that will receive bursary girls. The direct beneficiaries&#13;
include many children who would otherwise receive little or no education. As&#13;
we expect parents to increase their efforts to enroll boys in secondary school in&#13;
response to the improved opportunities for girls, we anticipate that the secondary&#13;
school beneficiaries will include a significant number of boys who would not&#13;
otherwise have gone to secondary school.&#13;
Inequality&#13;
119. For an average rural household, we estimate that bringing everyone's&#13;
educatioh to the primary level would result in a 14 percentage point reduction in&#13;
the number of households living below the poverty line (World Bank 1996).&#13;
Principally by widening access, improving quality, and explicitly targeting the&#13;
poor, this project will contribute to poverty reduction and raise the earnings&#13;
capacity of affected households.&#13;
Gender&#13;
120. The project will reduce gender imbalances by facilitating access of girls&#13;
to secondary education and by supporting mechanisms to keep girls in school.&#13;
The GSES will benefit the girls already in the secondary education system by&#13;
making the system more friendly to them through gender awareness activities.&#13;
The bursary prograrn is expected to motivate girls in primary school to improve&#13;
their performance.&#13;
Reduced Population Growth, Improved Family Health, Higher Investments&#13;
in Children&#13;
121. A longer run benefit will be higher earnings capacity (especially for the&#13;
bursary girls) reduced levels of fertility, better nutritional and health status for&#13;
children, and greater educational opportunities for future generations.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening, Capacity Building, and Policy Development&#13;
122. An intentional exclusion from the benefit side of the economic analysis&#13;
was a valuation for the project's institutional benefits, which will include: (a)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Tazada Human Resource Development Pilot Project                  43&#13;
building capacity in the statistics department of the MOEC in monitoring and&#13;
evaluating the educational system; (b) strengthening the capacity of district&#13;
governments; (c) strengthening the national examination system; (d) improving&#13;
information about the market for secondary education; (e) improving&#13;
Government's ability to monitor the impact of its subsidies; (f) strengthening&#13;
district education teams to assist primary schools; and (g) involving&#13;
communities in generating to their educational problems. The benefits from&#13;
these interventions are expected to be considerable, but they are fairly intangible.&#13;
RISKS&#13;
123.  There are three general project-specific risks. First, the acceptable&#13;
performance achieved so far under the pre-test may be due to relatively close&#13;
supervision that cannot be replicated on a larger scale. Second, the hypotheses&#13;
that govern the development of this pilot may be wrong. For the CEF, the main&#13;
hypotheses are that better planning, more money, more transparency, and more&#13;
teacher and parental control at the primary school level will lead to better&#13;
outcomes in primary education. For the GSES, the main hypothesis is that poor&#13;
girls are failing to attend secondary school primarily because of financial reasons&#13;
and that financing education for these girls will raise enrollments of both boys&#13;
and girls, resulting in large payoffs for society. If these hypotheses prove to be&#13;
wrong, the project will not have the expected impacts. Third, Tanzania has&#13;
poorly developed financial and banking institutions, which may create&#13;
difficulties in some areas of the country, as this project requires that schools use&#13;
bank accounts.&#13;
Community Education Fund&#13;
124. With the CEF, two additional risks concern the possible behavior of&#13;
parents and teachers. First, parents may not be able to make the required&#13;
financial contributions, or their contributions may be so low that the&#13;
corresponding matching funds from the CEF will be insufficient to make an&#13;
appreciable improvement in primary school quality or enrollments. Second,&#13;
without more supervision and control from the Ministry of Education than&#13;
envisaged, parents and teachers may decide to spend their funds on inappropriate&#13;
purchases.&#13;
125. Other risks concern the institutional and administrative capacity of&#13;
village-level committees, district governments, and the central government to&#13;
implement the project. There are also questions about the interest and ability of&#13;
district governments to carry out their responsibilities for training, support, and&#13;
assessment. Administrative costs may be so high as to prevent wider&#13;
implementation. Higher levels of funding may not increase school enrollments&#13;
or augment the quality of education. Parents may inadequately supervise their&#13;
local schools to get good value for the money that will be made available. For&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44                                                Staff Appndsal Report&#13;
all of these performance risks, schools will put themselves on a distribution.&#13;
The question to be answered is whether in the end the average performance is&#13;
high enough and the variance in performance narrow enough to conclude that&#13;
the risks have been managed adequately. Already, as mentioned earlier, the&#13;
design has been altered several times to better manage some of the risks. It is in&#13;
the nature of the pilot that the design will continue to be adjusted as problems&#13;
are encountered and solved. However, an innovation in this design is that&#13;
school-level risks are small (not more than $5,000 annually), the CEF and GSES&#13;
create incentives and mechanisms for self-policing of risks, there will be many&#13;
good and bad examples to learn from, and the whole project is set up as a&#13;
learning-by-doing exercise.&#13;
Girls' Bursary Component&#13;
126. For the GSES, potential risks include: (a) the village council may not&#13;
fulfill its role of providing a check to be sure poorer girls are selected; (b) some&#13;
girls may receive the scholarship with such low scores on the Primary School&#13;
Leaving Examination that they may fail without remedial training or may fail to&#13;
fmd a secondary school that will accept them; (c) for rural communities, the&#13;
number of players in the scholarship program may be too many to manage; (d)&#13;
schools may fail in their fiduciary role to adequately care for the girls. As with&#13;
the CEF, part of the reason for the pilot is to find out if the risks can be managed&#13;
adequately so that the considerable potential benefits of the GSES program can&#13;
be realized at reasonable cost.&#13;

Annex C: Review of Pre-Tests&#13;
COMMUNITY EDUCATION FUND&#13;
1.    Professor Suleman Sumra (1996) reviewed the CEF pre-test in the first&#13;
four schools that participated in the program. The paper includes the following&#13;
major observations:&#13;
a.   Information and Knowledge. Parents were well aware of&#13;
the program. All were willing to help finance school&#13;
activities if they knew how the money would be spent&#13;
and were confident that there would be adequate places to&#13;
allow them to enroll their children in school on time.&#13;
b.    Emnpowerment and Participation. The CEF was a&#13;
fundamental departure from education management in&#13;
Tanzania because it gave communities and schools the&#13;
flexibility to influence educational decisions. Indeed, it&#13;
was the first time Professor Sumra had observed in&#13;
Tanzania that teachers were asked to take responsibility&#13;
for, and to help decide what, was happening in their&#13;
schools. Further, it was the first time that teachers and&#13;
parents were required to work together on these tasks.&#13;
c.    Financing. Professor Surnra was impressed by the&#13;
willingness of parents to contribute to program financing.&#13;
Payment of the Tsh 200 school fee (less than $0.50) was&#13;
about 60 percent before the CEF program. In the CEF&#13;
schools, pledges ranged from Tsh 2,000 to Tsh 4,000. In&#13;
one village, parents borrowed the money from a wealthy&#13;
farmer and paid him back after the harvest. Professor&#13;
Sumra suggested that the willingness of parents to&#13;
contribute might be due not to the existence of a matching&#13;
grant, but rather to the transparent process that had been&#13;
set up. Parents knew there was a plan for using the&#13;
money, they could observe how it was going to be spent,&#13;
and they would receive an accounting of expenditures&#13;
before they were asked to pay again.&#13;
d.    Priorities. Parents' and teachers' highest priority was to&#13;
construct additional classrooms and teacher housing. This&#13;
is probably appropriate because of the lack of investment&#13;
in these facilities over many years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52                                                          Annex C&#13;
2.    Professor Sumra noted some potential issues:&#13;
a.    Participant Fatigue. This was a new program, and&#13;
everyone was enthusiastic. But it creates a lot of work for&#13;
teachers and parents. Would they (especially teachers)&#13;
continue to undertake these activities if there was no&#13;
remuneration for the extra work?&#13;
b.    Financing. The Project is predicated on schools having a&#13;
bank account and is based on an urban concept of paying&#13;
money. In the rural areas, people go for long stretches of&#13;
time with no money. The pre-test was implemented by a&#13;
consulting firm that paid the matching grant promptly and&#13;
according to the rules of the program. Does the&#13;
government have the capacity to implement this activity&#13;
country-wide? The amount of money that the project was&#13;
able to mobilize in the communities was a modest sum&#13;
compared to what is needed.&#13;
C.    Construction Quality. Given that the program resulted in&#13;
a focus on infrastructure, Professor Sumra was concerned&#13;
about the ability of the participating communities to meet&#13;
reasonable standards of construction quality. Yet he&#13;
thought that some of the communities had made&#13;
reasonable construction compromises, such as reducing&#13;
the size of the classrooms to what was actually needed&#13;
(smaller than the standards required).&#13;
3.   In the terminal report of its consultancy, the pre-test implementing&#13;
contractor (Merit International 1997) noted a number of problems with the&#13;
program including: challenges in training at the village level; the voluntary&#13;
nature of the CEF contribution by parents; inadequate marketing; the district&#13;
government's inability to supervise schools due to a lack of transport; the need&#13;
for better guidelines for classroom and desk designs for CEF schools; a lack of&#13;
management training for head teachers; poor school-level statistics; the&#13;
existence of multiple donors implementing different programs in several&#13;
districts; and the need for commitment at each level (school, village, district,&#13;
center) for the program to work.&#13;
4.    Further, a key problem in the pre-test is the high cost of training required&#13;
due to the participatory/transparency elements of the CEF and GSES. These&#13;
costs can easily amount to several times the value of the matching grant and the&#13;
girls' bursary, so they can only be justified if they are a one-time investment&#13;
leading to high and sustained improvements in school-level funding. Thus a key&#13;
element of pilot monitoring, evaluation, and annual improvements to the design&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Review of Pre-Tests                                             53&#13;
will be how to minimize overhead costs so that 95 percent or more of the funds&#13;
actually reach the school and the girls.&#13;
GIRLS' EDUCATION SUPPORT PROGRAM&#13;
5.   In addition, Professors S. Sumra, G. Malekela, A. Kilindo, and A. Dachi&#13;
(1997) reviewed the Girls' Secondary Education Support Pre-Test. Generally&#13;
this review is positive on the selection mechanism (it seems to work well in&#13;
selected the best poor girls with few leakages to better-off families) and the&#13;
girls' ability to succeed in secondary school. The report raises the following&#13;
concerns, however:&#13;
a.    The marketing of the project in 1995 was done hurriedly.&#13;
Not many of the girls who were eventually selected knew&#13;
that they were being considered for the bursary. The&#13;
overall result was that many of the bursary recipients were&#13;
late in joining their secondary schools. There were also&#13;
problems stemming from the selection process. In the&#13;
second year, the program had better marketing, but more&#13;
complex and confusing selection procedures were used.&#13;
b.   In a number of schools, the girls were not provided with&#13;
all the items they were intended to receive, e.g., uniforms,&#13;
textbooks, or money for transportation. It was unclear to&#13;
parents and students what expenses would be covered by&#13;
the bursary. Closer follow-up of the recipient girls would&#13;
help address these problems.&#13;
C.    Parents and girls were not aware of the quality of&#13;
secondary school in their zone and usually chose schools&#13;
which were near their homes. A greater effort to convey&#13;
the range of choices open to these families would be&#13;
helpful.&#13;
d.    The performance of bursary girls was comparable to&#13;
others in school. However, one problem that most face is&#13;
that they join secondary schools with low PSLE scores.&#13;
Unless they get help to overcome this disadvantage, it is&#13;
unlikely that they will progress enough to proceed beyond&#13;
lower secondary school.&#13;
e.    Girls studying at day schools face particular problems.&#13;
Some stay with their relatives and some live in rented&#13;
rooms. Some of those who live with their relatives get&#13;
treated as house girls and get burdened with domestic&#13;
chores. Those who live in rented rooms live in poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54                                                            Annex C&#13;
conditions, without electricity or running water and have&#13;
to face unwanted attention from men. Some girls had to&#13;
walk long distances to school. There is a need for the&#13;
project to look at ways of providing hostel facilities for&#13;
these girls.&#13;
f.    Although the number was not large, there were cases of&#13;
drop outs, most due to pregnancy. These girls, especially&#13;
those away from their parents, get little or no guidance or&#13;
counseling. There is a need for the project to ensure that&#13;
all the girls have someone in the school to whom they can&#13;
turn for help when in trouble.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex D: Economic Assessment&#13;
BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS: INTERNAL RATES OF RETURN&#13;
Overview of the Range of Returns for the Whole Project&#13;
1.   If the project's full costs&#13;
are considered (including       Annex Table D. 1. Estimated Internal&#13;

children attending school) the  * Household CEF Contributions, CEF Grants, and&#13;
internal rate of return (IRR) for    GSES Bursaries&#13;
the CEF component is conservatively estimated at 19 percent; and for the GSES,&#13;
6 percent. The return for the project as a whole is estimated at 12 percent. If&#13;
only the direct costs of parental contributions to the CEF, project contributions&#13;
of matching funds for the CEF, and project funding of bursaries for the GSES&#13;
are considered, the IRR for the Community Education Fund is estimated at 48&#13;
percent; and for the GSES, at 11 percent. With this lower cost structure, the&#13;
return for the project as a whole is estimated at 26 percent (see Annex Table&#13;
D.1).&#13;
2.    Because this benefit-cost analysis assigns no independent benefits to the&#13;
Capacity Building or Policy Development, Planning, and Research components,&#13;
treating them only as costs or supporting activities of the CEF and GSES, the&#13;
IRRs in Annex Table D. 1 should be considered lower-bound estimates. Unless&#13;
the unquantified benefits for these other components are zero or negative, the&#13;
returns to the project can be assumed to be substantially higher than estimated.&#13;
Benefits&#13;
3.    The IRR estimates for both programs are based on pecuniary, private&#13;
benefits to individuals from increased schooling and increased school quality,&#13;
and a conservatively estimated monetary equivalent of non-pecuniary benefits&#13;
(such as reduced fertility among girls with more education, and improved&#13;
schooling and health prospects for the children of primary and secondary school&#13;
leavers). The benefits used in the analysis and the estimated value per pupil are&#13;
shown in Annex Table D.2).&#13;
4.    This analysis ignores the general positive externalities of a better&#13;
educated population and the positive income distribution implications of the&#13;
project. A disproportionately large proportion of the new children likely to&#13;
enroll in primary school as a consequence of the CEF will come from low-&#13;
income, disadvantaged backgrounds. All of the estimated 3,415 girls&#13;

5.      The IRR for the GSES assumes that enrollment of boys does not increase&#13;
as a consequence of increasing enrollment for girls. Yet in actuality, it is likely&#13;
that if households are sending their daughters to secondary school, they will&#13;
undertake additional efforts to secure secondary education for their sons.&#13;
4 The additional benefits (and costs) of the subset of girls who will be financed for upper secondary school&#13;
are not included, as that element was added during negotiations, after this analysis was completed.&#13;

7.       This project is a relatively small, pilot effort. Thus the capacity building,&#13;
policy development, planning, and research costs are distributed over a relatively&#13;
small group of beneficiaries. However, the learning curve is steep, and the pre-&#13;
tests have shown that after two years, most of the training costs can be&#13;
eliminated. The IRRs can be increased during implementation if the Borrower is&#13;
successful in moving resources out of administrative and training costs and into&#13;
grants and scholarships, which it is committed to do if possible.&#13;
Community Education Fund: Least-Cost Approach?&#13;
8.       To supplement the benefit-cost analysis, this section considers whether&#13;
the CEF program is the least-cost method to achieve the stated objectives of&#13;
raising enrollments and enhancing quality in primary education.&#13;
9.    It is our conclusion that the CEF should be among the lowest-cost means&#13;
of raising pupil enrollments and enhancing school quality, particularly in terms&#13;
of the cost to the Government. Resources under the CEF are delivered virtually&#13;
directly to beneficiaries. Thus, several layers of bureaucracy, and the&#13;
accompanying expenditures and overhead costs, are eliminated (although the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58                                                           Annex D&#13;
start-up costs of the program are added). Second, as parents have a substantial&#13;
amount of their own resources invested in the CEF, there is a strong incentive&#13;
for them to seek least-cost alternatives at the school level. The learning that can&#13;
take place across schools is a feature that is expected to help schools improve&#13;
their performance.&#13;
10.  In the pre-tests, most CEF resources have been spent by school&#13;
committees on construction of classrooms, teachers' accommodations, and head-&#13;
teachers' offices. While there are large variations across pre-test sites, the&#13;
average construction cost per classroom has been estimated at Tsh 750,000.&#13;
This is well below the average estimated cost of Tsh 2,500,000 per classroom&#13;
constructed under the most recent Bank-assisted project in Tanzania. We do not&#13;
know how much of the difference in unit costs is the result of greater efficiency&#13;
in the use of building materials (because of greater involvement of, and&#13;
monitoring by, parents), lower inputs prices, reduced wastage of materials, the&#13;
contributions of free expertise and labor inputs by parents and community&#13;
members, or the use of lower-quality construction inputs.&#13;
11.   The CEF has a potential longer-term cost advantage. A substantial&#13;
portion of the money used for construction is contributed by parents, so they are&#13;
expected to better provide for the maintenance of new facilities than if&#13;
construction were funded entirely from government/donor resources. This is&#13;
likely to generate significant cost savings over the long run. Thus, the&#13;
cumulative costs of construction, maintenance, and rehabilitation is likely to be&#13;
significantly lower under the CEF.&#13;
GSES Program: Impact on the Distribution of Subsidies&#13;
12.   For the GSES program, the distributional impact of the program in&#13;
providing greater access to secondary education is a large benefit that is missed&#13;
in the benefit-cost analysis. This section provides an indication of the potential&#13;
impact of the program in this area.&#13;
Enrollment Impact&#13;
13.   Using enrollment data from 1995, the effect of the GSES on enrollment&#13;
has been extrapolated to 1999. The assumptions made are that (a) each village&#13;
sends only one girl to secondary school; (b) there is no growth in enrollment&#13;
outside that generated by GSES-e.g., without GSES, enrollments for boys and&#13;
girls would not change between 1995 and 1999; (c) there is no feedback effect&#13;
(in other words, enrollment of boys does not increase as a consequence of&#13;
increasing enrollment for girls); and (d) GSES girls do not drop out of school&#13;
and GSES girls do not crowd out other enrollment.&#13;
14.   Under these assumptions, the GSES has a significant impact on girls'&#13;
enrollments. There were 2,612 girls (5,688 boys and girls) enrolled in lower&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Economic Assessment                                                 59&#13;
secondary school in 1995 in the eight districts that the pilot initially covers. By&#13;
1999, the total number of girls enrolled would increased to 6,556, an increase of&#13;
151 percent. Girls' enrollments are expected to increase by over 100 percent at&#13;
all levels (Form I-Form IV). Similarly, total enrollments will increase by close&#13;
to 50 percent between 1995 and&#13;
1999 (Annex Table DA.4&#13;
Annex Table D.4. Estimated Enrollment&#13;
15.   The actual effects on               Impact of GSES&#13;
enrollments may be less if some              Female          All&#13;

otherwise gone to secondary    All         2,612  5,688  6,556  9,632&#13;
school, which is likely to have a&#13;
dampening impact on growth in enrollments. However, the extent to which&#13;
crowding out is significant is unclear as it depends on the supply response to this&#13;
increase in demand. Data on secondary school enrollments over the past 10&#13;
years show that the supply response has been strong, thus it is likely that&#13;
crowding out will not be significant.&#13;
16.   On the other hand, the actual effects on enrollment may be greater than&#13;
predicted. There is likely to be a feedback effect as sending girls to school will&#13;
also have a positive impact on boys enrollment.&#13;
Incidence Analysis&#13;
17.   Tanzania's expenditures on secondary education have not been effective&#13;
in helping the poor. An increase in effectiveness and efficiency can be achieved&#13;
by increasing the participation of the poor in programs for which the inequality&#13;
in benefits is due to low enrollment rates among the lowest quintiles. The&#13;
distribution of education subsidies across different levels of schooling arises&#13;
from a mix of factors-both demographic and behavioral-that determine the&#13;
number of children enrolled from each quintile. Poorer families have more&#13;
children. The average number of children below the age of 18 is 4.1 for&#13;
households in the bottom quintile and 2.4 for households in the top quintile.&#13;
There is also the behavioral factor of how likely different households are to&#13;
enroll their children in school.&#13;
18.   It is possible to decompose differences in the subsidies across the&#13;
different welfare quintiles into a component that reflects demographic&#13;
characteristics and another component that reflects behavior. This&#13;
decomposition is shown in Annex Table D.5.&#13;

*The difference between the subsidy to the poorest quintile and the subsidy to the highest quintile.&#13;
19.    The poorest quintile received a per-capita subsidy in 1995 that was much&#13;
lower (Tsh 127.5) than that received by the highest quintile (Tsh 569.8). The&#13;
poorest quintile's subsidy falls slightly (to Tsh. 104.8) if the demographic&#13;
structure for the poorest quintile is forced to mimic that of the richest (if the poor&#13;
have fewer children on average, 2.4 per household rather than 4.1), but jumps&#13;
considerably (to Tsh 692.5) if the pattern of enrollment of the richest quintile is&#13;
transferred to the poorest. Thus, the targeting of secondary education subsidies&#13;
could be vastly improved in the short run by increasing the number of children&#13;
from poor households enrolled in secondary school through a scholarship&#13;
program.&#13;

receives 34.1 percent. After the introduction of the scholarship program, the&#13;
distribution of secondary school public expenditures in the 8 pilot districts&#13;
becomes pro-poor. In 3 years, the poorest 40 percent of the population will&#13;
receive 46 percent of the subsidy. The results are even more striking for the&#13;
female population. In 3 years, under a conservative scenario, the poorest 40&#13;
percent of the female population in those 8 districts will receive 65 percent of&#13;
the benefits from public expenditures on female secondary education.15&#13;
5 Note that the absolute value of the subsidies reviewed in this section is small because they are on a per&#13;
capita basis rather than a per-pupil basis.&#13;

Annex E: Financial Assessment&#13;
1.    This financial assessment examines the full annual cost of funding&#13;
primary education and operating the project in 2007, when it is assumed that the&#13;
project has a national scope and that all start-up expenses have already been&#13;
incurred. The sustainability of the project under alternative assumptions about&#13;
growth in real incomes is also considered. The analysis is performed under three&#13;
gross enrollment rate scenarios. All figures are in 1996 US dollars.&#13;

this cost is the cost of maintaining per pupil primary school expenditures at their&#13;
current levels (Annex Table E.2).&#13;
16 The basic (excluding the CEF) cost of primary education is assumed to be the same per pupil as it is&#13;
today, where the per-pupil cost includes spending by the government, donors, and households.&#13;

alternative gross enrollment and real income growth scenarios.&#13;
Scenario 1: No Increase in Primary School Gross Enrollment Rates&#13;
6.    If gross enrollment rates do not change, Tanzania should be able to&#13;
support primary education and the nationwide roll-out of the CEF and GSES&#13;
programs by 2007 assuming the country experiences at least 1 percent annual&#13;
real growth in incomes over the next 10 years (Annex Table E.4). Any&#13;
additional growth could provide funds for higher per-pupil spending. If incomes&#13;
are constant or decline, this program, combined with continued government&#13;
support to education at its current level of expenditures per pupil, will require&#13;
either a significant increase in education's share of the government's net current&#13;
expenditures and/or substantial additional donor support.&#13;

per pupil, will require either a large increase in education's share of the&#13;
government's net current expenditures ancdor a great deal of additional donor&#13;
support.&#13;
Scenario 3: Gross Enrollment Rate of 105 Percent&#13;
8.     If Tanzania's gross enrollment rate increases to 105 percent by 2007, the&#13;
country should be able to support primary education and the nationwide roll-out&#13;
of the CEF and GSES programs assuming it experiences at least 3 percent&#13;
annual real growth in incomes over the next 10 years and undertakes education&#13;
reforms (Annex Table E.6). 7 If incomes increase by less than 3 percent per year&#13;
17 Education reforms include eliminating financial support for surplus primary school teachers; reducing&#13;
government support for tertiary education facilities and targeting remaining support to needy students;&#13;
eliminating government support for travel and education abroad; and eliminating the Ministries of&#13;
Higher Education, Labor, and Community Development and transferring their essential functions to the&#13;

and if education reforns are not implemented, this program, combined with&#13;
continued government support to education at its current level of expenditures&#13;
per pupil, will require a huge increase in education's share of the government's&#13;

9.    Although it was observed earlier that Tanzania is expected to have&#13;
considerable trouble maintaining per-pupil expenditures on primary education as&#13;
population growth continues to race ahead of revenue growth, these scenarios&#13;
suggest that sustained real growth in the economy can provide some reasonable&#13;
options for increasing support to primary and secondary education. Tanzania's&#13;
experience from 1985 through 1995 was a per capita growth rate in GNP of 1&#13;
percent annually and of 3.5 percent annually in overall GDP. This experience is&#13;
at the high end of the simulations in this section.&#13;
10.   Even so, the goals of the CEF and GSES programs and of the SDP are to&#13;
raise primary and secondary school enrollments substantially and quickly in&#13;
addition to increasing spending on quality-enhancing investments. If&#13;
successful-if Tanzania can reach the high case of a 105 percent primary&#13;
enrollment rate coupled with much higher secondary enrollments-resource&#13;
requirements will certainly exceed the estimates in this section. A successful&#13;
education policy will not be able to ignore the need for budgetary reallocations,&#13;
education reforms, and persistent donor support for primary and secondary&#13;
education. Because Tanzania is likely to be able to continue to finance an&#13;
education system that functions at the current level, perhaps a sensible type of&#13;
conditionality for donor assistance to get out of this trap should be that large&#13;
improvement in enrollment rates are actually forthcoming and that the most&#13;
important education reforms are undertaken without delay.&#13;

Annex H: Summary of Other Donor Programs in&#13;
Education&#13;
1.    DANIDA is the largest donor in the education sector. It is currently&#13;
embarking on the three year support and expansion phase of its Primary Education&#13;
Program (PEP), to be followed by a consolidation year in 2000. A pilot program&#13;
focusing on improvement of teacher and pupil performance levels, PEP is now&#13;
budgeted at approximately US$3 million per year. DANIDA works closely with&#13;
SIDA and the Vocational Education and Training Authority (VETA) on the&#13;
tertiary and vocational levels of education, contributing to various regional&#13;
vocational and training schools throughout Tanzania.&#13;
2.    DffD is planning to substantially increase its support to the education&#13;
sector by focusing on government initiatives in basic education, such as improving&#13;
the primary school curricula, the training of teachers, and the efficiency of&#13;
examinations. DffD is also promoting improvement English language instructions&#13;
in primary schools. In secondary education, DffD focuses on improvement and&#13;
extension of the teaching of the English language to students and teachers.&#13;
3.    SIDA focuses its efforts on the production of textbooks for primary&#13;
schools. It is the predominant financier of the Book Management Unit in the&#13;
MOEC and helped to increase the number of textbooks in circulation from 0.6&#13;
million in 1988 to more than 4 million in 1994. SIDA also funds a program to&#13;
improve training for primary school teachers. In VETA, SIDA is heavily involved&#13;
in many regional projects, attempting to improve the quality of the country's&#13;
skilled work force.&#13;
4.    NORAD is a major donor to tertiary education, funding numerous&#13;
programs in Tanzanian universities and technical schools. NORAD's efforts range&#13;
from training students in maritime skills to enhancing an animal science program&#13;
in hopes of making post-graduate work possible in this field. NORAD also funds&#13;
the National Education Trust Fund (NETF) that promotes community initiatives to&#13;
enhance the quality and availability of secondary schools. NORAD is increasing&#13;
support for primary education through funding of UNICEF's program.&#13;
5.    The Government of the Netherlands has announced its intention to increase&#13;
support for basic education in many developing countries. This represents a break&#13;
from its traditional support to the education sector, which was aimed at tertiary&#13;
education. They will promote this new strategy through multinational and&#13;
bilateral channels. Two-thirds of the increased aid will be given to the Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa region. US$7.8 million has been committed to the Tanzanian&#13;
education sector for the years 1995 through 1998 for joint support with Danida to&#13;
district-based education planning. Approximately US$1.7 million has been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
70                                                          Annex H&#13;
committed to local government training programs from 1995 to 1997, with a focus&#13;
on imnproving district education planning.&#13;
6.   Irish Aid spends approximately US$0.9 million annually on education&#13;
projects in Tanzania, primarily in Kilosa. Its objective is to improve the teaching&#13;
of math and sciences at the primary level through direct support to teachers and&#13;
regional schools at the district level and indirect support through zonal and&#13;
national programs. Irish Aid also funds various vocational and university level&#13;
programs aimed at improving engineering abilities, agricultural techniques, and&#13;
mathematical skills.&#13;
7.    GTZ offers a combination of technical and financial assistance to the&#13;
Christian Social Service Commission (CSSC) for the improvement of services in&#13;
secondary schools run by churches. The main focus of GTZ, however, is on the&#13;
tertiary and vocational levels, where they support many programs. After&#13;
assisting with the creation of the Technical College in Arusha until 1986, GTZ is&#13;
now supporting the foundation of a training course there for Road Technicians.&#13;
Other projects receiving GTZ support include the establishment of the Institute&#13;
of Product Innovation at UDSM, aid to agricultural and orthopedic training&#13;
universities, aid for science education in secondary schools, and assistance to the&#13;
Faculty of Engineering at UDSM.&#13;
8.    UNICEF includes most of its funding for primary schools in its Program&#13;
for Child Survival Protection and Development in Tanzania. If communities&#13;
choose education as a high priority for social development, UNICEF assists by&#13;
financing the training of school committees, support to teacher centers, and the&#13;
strengthening of district and ward support systems. UNICEF also supports an&#13;
AIDS education program in primary schools. Adult education and early&#13;
childhood development are promoted as supporting strategies to UNICEF's&#13;
primary school efforts.&#13;
9.    The European Union (EU) has in the past provided general budgetary&#13;
support for basic education and health through counterpart funds generated from&#13;
balance of payments support. It is now supporting development of sector-wide&#13;
master plans and coordinated donor support to the education sector. It may&#13;
provide in the future potentially large amounts of cash to help fund these&#13;
programs.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Human Resources Development Pilot
            Project will contribute to the Country Assistance Strategy
            (CAS) objective of increasing investment in human capital by
            seeking to strengthen Tanzania's education sector
            through the following components: 1) raising enrollments and
            quality/learning outcomes of primary education through
            increased parental participation and financing, school-based
            planning and management of resources, school-based quality
            enhancement initiatives, and improved support for schools at
            the district level, through a Community Education Fund
            Pilot; 2) expanding educational opportunities and improving
            quality at the secondary level, particularly for poorer
            girls, through a Girl's Secondary Education Support
            Pilot; 3) building capacity through these programs at the
            district and community levels and through selective training
            and project implementation at the central level; and 4)
            improving policy development, planning, and research through
            improved testing and statistics systems, operations
            research, policy studies, and strategic sector development plans.
