III. Recommendations                            There is a need to understand the&#13;
                                                constraints to data collection and analysis&#13;
The policy recommendations outlined             at different points along the chain of&#13;
here are intended to address some of the        reporting to prosecution. For example, as&#13;
specific dimensions of crime and                detailed in Notes 1 and 2, the current data&#13;
violence in PNG that emerged during the         shows a large gap between crimes rates&#13;

justice institutions, and strengthening         and order institutions. The analysis&#13;
partnerships for crime and violence             would need to consider the ways in&#13;
prevention. Where relevant, these               which these constraints differ for&#13;
recommendations are directed at specific        different    groups     (women,       youth,&#13;
actors.                                         children), by type of crime, and other&#13;

        <abstracts>
            At the request of the Prime
            Minister's office, between 2011-2013, the World Bank
            conducted a study to understand the social and economic
            costs of crime and violence in Papua New Guinea. The purpose
            of the study was to feed a national conversation about crime
            and violence and inform policy directions and program
            interventions. The findings of the study are summarized in
            this research and dialogue series. This brief outlines the
            policy and programming recommendations that emerge from the
            research. The recommendations are intended to provide
            information, possible policy approaches towards an ongoing
            dialogue on the issue of crime and violence and that they
            will fuel a growing coalition of state and civil society
            actors for an integrated response.
