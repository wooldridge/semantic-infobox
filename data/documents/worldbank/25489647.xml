&amp;#12;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
1.       Jobs are a central lens to a countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic development. Job outcomes largely&#13;
determine the growth of national earnings and are thereby fundamental to improving standards of&#13;
living. The ability of an economy to provide good jobs outcomesâ&#128;&#148;to create sufficient jobs for&#13;
those seeking work, to generate productive jobs, and to ensure that high-quality jobs are available&#13;
to the broad populationâ&#128;&#148;is a key measure of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s overall development performance.&#13;
&#13;
2.       This report takes an in-depth look at the development of jobs in the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
over the past decade to understand why the country has not realized better job outcomes.&#13;
Drawing on evidence at the macro, household, and firm level, it examines key shortcomings in the&#13;
current migration-led, remittance-driven development model that have weakened the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
ability to create sufficient and high-quality employment opportunities and are likely to result in&#13;
deteriorating job outcomes in the future. The report argues that several broad transformations will&#13;
be needed to develop engines of growth in the Kyrgyz Republic outside remittances and shift to a&#13;
better jobs path. The distortions and obstacles that currently prevent the expansion of private sector&#13;
employment need to be unraveled; macroeconomic, regulatory, and logistical impediments to&#13;
greater, more diversified export orientation need to be strategically addressed; the compensation of&#13;
public employees must be reformed to reduce the level of corruption that discourages business&#13;
growth; and the migration phenomenon, which will be a part of the employment mosaic for at least&#13;
another decade, must be made to contribute to domestic employment creation and the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A GROWTH RECOVERY BASED ON LABOR EXODUS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.       Over the first decade of the 2000s, because of the severe lack of jobs and low salaries,&#13;
Kyrgyz workers began to move abroad in droves in search of better employment prospects.&#13;
The country thus managed to pull itself out of the deep economic collapse following independence&#13;
largely through the incomes of these migrants and the remittances they sent back home. Unofficial&#13;
estimates of the extent of migration put the number of migrants abroad between 500,000 â&#128;&#147; 1 million,&#13;
or between 9-17 percent of the population. Most are young men (between 15 and 34), where the&#13;
deficit in needed domestic jobs was highest. In the span of a decade, the Kyrgyz Republic moved&#13;
from a country with virtually no out-migration to one in which remittances accounted for more than&#13;
32 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).&#13;
&#13;
4.      Remittances were instrumental in reducing poverty, particularly in the poorest&#13;
regions of the country. Poverty, which impacted almost three-quarters of rural areas and over half&#13;
of urban households in 2003, had fallen by more than 30 percentage points by the mid-2000s&#13;
(Figure 1). For households with a migrant abroad, the receipt of remittances accounted for almost&#13;
double the reduction in poverty over the 2008 to 2013 period (with lower levels of domestic&#13;
employment and lower domestic wages for those working contributing to some poverty worsening).&#13;
Remittance flows not only aided migrant sending families directly, but they financed a boom in&#13;
domestic consumption spending that spurred a rebound in domestic job growth, primarily in&#13;

&amp;#12;services (Figure 2). This allowed initially strong productivity improvements as workers in&#13;
agriculture moved to higher-value work in cities and abroad.&#13;

5.       Remittances and the growth of jobs in new areas also reduced long-standing&#13;
geographical disparities. The north and the south of the country are divided by mountain ranges,&#13;
and there are ethnic and socio-economic divisions between the north and south as well. In part&#13;
stemming from the natural disadvantages of its rough topography (rendering access to many&#13;
services difficult), large socio-economic disparities have existed between rural and urban areas,&#13;
which have on occasion led tensions significantly impacting economic performance1. The influx&#13;
of remittances (many to rural families) and the creation of new employment (largely in the services&#13;
sector) in rural areas has mitigated these socio-economic differences.&#13;

â&#128;¦BUT A DEVELOPMENT MODEL SHOWING SIGNS OF DISTRESS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.      Despite many of the positive byproducts that accompanied migration, there are increasing&#13;
signs that the current model of economic growth and jobs based on a migration-led, remittance-&#13;
driven model of development is unsustainable.&#13;
&#13;
7.     The domestic economy is unable to generate sufficient employment to accommodate&#13;
the growing labor force. While the inflow of worker remittances supported a boost in economic&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
  The Kyrgyz Republic has experienced violent conflict on several occasions since its independence,&#13;
including ethnic clashes in 2010.&#13;

&#13;
                                                                                                                       vi&#13;
&amp;#12;growth and domestic employment creation, mostly in the services sector, domestic job growth has&#13;
continued to lag the expansion in the size of the labor force. In 2009â&#128;&#147;13, job growth averaged only&#13;
0.9 percent a year, about two-thirds the pace of the expansion in the labor force. Although the&#13;
official unemployment rate held relatively steady, the gap between the number of available workers&#13;
and the number of jobs was filled by climbing rates of out-migration and exits from the labor force.&#13;
The presence of remittances affected reservation wages, and as migration expanded, domestic labor&#13;
force participation declined. The steepest decline emanated from females, where between 2000&#13;
and 2013, participation declined from over 62 percent to less than 50 percent.&#13;
&#13;
8.      Job quality is not improving sufficiently to ensure convergence in the region. The&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic has the second-lowest level of output per workerâ&#128;&#148;worker productivityâ&#128;&#148;in the&#13;
Europe and Central Asia region, providing abundant potential for productivity convergence with&#13;
neighbors. However, although it realized stronger productivity growth than in previous periods, its&#13;
productivity growth relative to comparators has been low. Output per worker has increased, on&#13;
average, by only 4.3 percent a year since 2005, below the average productivity growth in the&#13;
economies of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and far off the pace of the poorer&#13;
CIS countries. Were productivity growth rates in the region to continue as over the past decade,&#13;
output per worker in the Kyrgyz Republic would not approach that of any neighboring country for&#13;
70 years. The current model of job creation does not provide the pace of productivity growth needed&#13;
to move the Kyrgyz Republic to a higher income status.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Productivity growth is steadily declining. Not only is productivity growth slower than&#13;
the pace achieved by neighboring economies, productivity growth in the Kyrgyz Republic has&#13;
steadily declined (from an average of 7.0 percent a year in 2005â&#128;&#147;09 to 0.7 percent a year in 2009â&#128;&#147;&#13;
12), suggesting there are limits to the current model (Figure 3). Most of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s productivity&#13;
gains have derived from services (Figure 4). While the initial growth in services was spectacular,&#13;
it was largely accounted for by a dramatic increase in transport and communications, which&#13;
shadowed the needs of the migration-led economy. As migration expanded, so did the need for&#13;
transport services and communications technology, including mobile telecommunications and&#13;
Internet. Over 2009â&#128;&#147;12, however, that robust source of productivity growth waned. Without&#13;
continued strong growth in migration, services are unlikely to buoy the countryâ&#128;&#153;s productivity&#13;
enhancements.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Productivity has been dragged by informality. A comparison of economy-wide&#13;
productivity estimates with productivity estimates from the formal sector suggests that informality&#13;
has been a significant factor in the deteriorating productivity growth both at the national level and&#13;
particularly within the industrial sector. Formal sector firm data suggests that aggregate&#13;
productivity growth in the formal sector has been strong, averaging 6.7 percent a year since 2009.&#13;
Economy wide, however, productivity growth averaged less than 1 percent a year, hinting at&#13;
significant productivity declines emanating from the informal sector. The formal/full economy&#13;
productivity differential is particularly large in the industrial sector, where informality has risen&#13;
strongly. The results suggest that both rising informalization (and productivity declines within the&#13;
informal sector) are strongly impacting overall productivity.&#13;
&#13;
11.     The decline in productivity has provided weakening scope for rising wages and&#13;
income per capita growth. Indeed, between 2009 and 2012, wage growth averaged only 2.8&#13;
percent a year (Figure 5). This amounts to about a quarter of the wage growth achieved in&#13;
neighboring countries. Long term income per capita growth also has trailed neighbors. Between&#13;
2003 and 2014, income per capita growth in the Kyrgyz Republic averaged 3.1 percent a year,&#13;
lower than every other CIS economy, half the rate of Uzbekistan, and a third of the rate in&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. As a result, while in 2003 income per capita in the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
was about 30 percent of the CIS average, by 2014 it had fallen to only 23 percent ($607).&#13;

12.     Despite lackluster wage growth compared with neighbors, Kyrgyzâ&#128;&#153;s real wage growth&#13;
exceeds productivity growth, weakening competitiveness. Real wages have grown by 10 percent&#13;
a year since 2005, driven by strong wage growth in both construction and services. Productivity&#13;
growth, on the other hand, has averaged less than 5 percent a year. The difference between wage&#13;
growth and productivity growth has been particularly high in the tradables sectors, weakening&#13;
external competitiveness. Real wages in agriculture averaged 17 percent a year, compared with 4&#13;
percent a year productivity growth. Manufacturing wages increased by an average of 6 percent a&#13;
year compared with productivity declines averaging 4 percent. This could be a symptom of labor&#13;
shortages developing from both internal and external migration. The general rise in wages in&#13;
tradeables without accompanying productivity growth is concerning because it signals a further&#13;
weakening of external competitiveness.&#13;
&#13;
13.      Rising migration may be further undermining human capital accumulation and&#13;
inclusive growth. The current model may be putting longer-term skill development at risk because&#13;
young workers are increasingly opting for work abroad over secondary-school completion. As&#13;
migration has risen labor force participation rates among young workers have increased, while the&#13;
proportion of workers who have not completed secondary education has almost doubled (Figure&#13;
7). The decision to leave school early has been particularly prevalent among poor workers. Between&#13;
2004 and 2007, the labor force participation rate among young workers increased from 72 to 76&#13;
percent, while the proportion with incomplete secondary education grew from 5 percent to 11&#13;
percent.&#13;

&amp;#12;14.      The formal private sector, with the potential to generate higher-quality jobs, remains&#13;
trivial in size and has not exhibited strong employment creation given its level of output&#13;
growth. A range of supply and demand factors are inhibiting the growth of the private sector,&#13;
ranging from distortive patent and compliance systems to logistical constraints. As a result, the&#13;
informal sector, in which productivity and wage growth have been anemic, has continued to be the&#13;
core job-creating sector.&#13;

15.      The small formal private sector has not expanded rapidlyâ&#128;¦ The Kyrgyz Republic has&#13;
one of the smallest formal private sectors in the region in terms of employment (Figure 8). Formal&#13;
private sector jobs account for only 11 percent of overall employment in the Kyrgyz Republic. This&#13;
is the lowest share among all CIS countries. More than 70 percent of employment occurs in the&#13;
informal sector, and about 18 percent in the public sector. While formal private sector output has&#13;
grown an average of 6.6 percent a year since 2009, the rate of growth has been inadequate to change&#13;
the employment dynamics meaningfully in the country. Informal sector activities continue to&#13;
dominate employment creation, but the activities are smaller in natureâ&#128;&#148;most operate with fewer&#13;
than five employees eachâ&#128;&#148;and are of significantly lower value. Moreover, while the formal private&#13;
sector demonstrated some productivity improvements in 2009â&#128;&#147;12, output per worker in the&#13;
informal sector stagnated, averaging about 1 percent a year.2&#13;
&#13;
16.      . . . and it has demonstrated limited capacity to create jobs. On top of low levels of&#13;
growth, the employment-creation capacity of growth in the formal sector is low. On average, while&#13;
the formal sector grew in real terms by 6.6 percent a year, job creation averaged less than 0.4&#13;
percent. The bulk of formal sector job creation comes from the public sector and nonprofit&#13;
establishments, and value-creating firms actually shed labor in net terms in 2009â&#128;&#147;12.&#13;

17.      Underlying these job outcomes are challenges to private sector productivity growth&#13;
and job creation, to which the remedies may stretch across a range of potential policy areas&#13;
and the development arena. Labor demand is inhibited by a distortive patent and compliance&#13;
system that constrains small-firm growth. Likewise, the limited amount of competitive pressure&#13;
faced by large establishments tends to help discourage firm entry and exit and technology&#13;
spillovers. Informality may be additionally fueled on the supply side by factors blocking&#13;
registration and formal sector employment.&#13;
&#13;
18.     Small firms create jobs, but are incentivized to stay small or informal. The formal&#13;
sector does not exhibit barriers to entry in aggregate, but it does exhibit barriers to firm growth&#13;
among small firms. Small firms exhibit significantly higher exit rates and significantly lower&#13;
graduation rates past smallness (Figure 9). Indeed, the lowest probability of an additional job&#13;
created among formal sector firms occurs among small firms on the cusp of medium size.&#13;
&#13;
19.     Growth past smallness is cost ineffective because of significant regulatory&#13;
requirements and formal or informal payments. Medium firms face the largest regulatory&#13;
burdens among firms according to size. They encounter higher taxes, additional payments for labor&#13;
insurance and social security, and additional costs associated with compliance, often stemming&#13;
from greater government harassment. Medium firms face the highest incidence of graft payments&#13;
in the operation of business. The burdens associated with growing past smallness inhibit formal&#13;
&#13;

 20.      A handful of large firms account for the majority of economic growth, but face few&#13;
 incentives to create jobs. Economic growth is overwhelmingly concentrated in a small number of&#13;
 large establishments that, as a whole, have created limited employment. Little more than 40 firms&#13;
 are responsible for more than half the overall output growth of growing establishments, but their&#13;
 contribution to employment growth is negligible.&#13;
&#13;
 21.      As a group, these large establishments demonstrate limited competitive pressures,&#13;
 reducing their incentives to invest and hire (Figure 10). They have about twice the access to&#13;
 bank lending as other large establishments and 5 times the access to government budgetary&#13;
 financing relative to other large firms. While they produce similar proportions of tradables relative&#13;
 to other companies, they face much less competition in terms of imports, suggesting that there is&#13;
 implicit or explicit protection.3 Because many of these large growing firms are involved in the&#13;
 production of heavy goods (concrete, bricks, motor vehicle parts, and so on), geography may also&#13;
 provide natural import protections given the appreciably higher freight costs. The evidence suggests&#13;
 there are substantially larger economies of scale available to the largest growing companies. And,&#13;
 the limited competitive pressures facing these large conglomerates have reduced business&#13;
 dynamism in the formal sector, thereby preventing the exit of otherwise unproductive industries&#13;
&#13;
 3&#13;
   The correspondence between import data and production data is not exact. Nonetheless, a rough&#13;
 correspondence between Standard International Trade Classification revision 2 product classifications at the&#13;
 four-digit level and Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community codes&#13;
 suggests that, under any circumstance, there was significantly greater import value relative to production&#13;
 among large firms and firms that were not large, but not among high-growth establishments.&#13;

&amp;#12;and the opening up of space for new firms, limiting entry in some sectors, particularly the most&#13;
important job-creating sectors, and limiting the technological spillovers to other firms, which&#13;
ultimately impedes job growth.&#13;

&#13;
22.      Export-oriented manufacturing is particularly impeded from stronger growth. While,&#13;
in aggregate, the rate of entry of establishments into the formal sector is high, particular sectors,&#13;
such as export-oriented manufacturing, exhibit significantly lower rates of firm entry. Given the&#13;
job-creation capacity of export-oriented manufacturing (on average, firms create 29 jobs), lack of&#13;
entry into this sector is particularly troublesome for jobs. As importantly, the experience of other&#13;
countries suggests that manufacturing firms are more likely to innovate, and the innovation that&#13;
takes place in manufacturing leads to productivity improvements throughout the economy. The&#13;
lack of entry in export-oriented manufacturing sectors may stem from the impediments to&#13;
competitiveness, those associated with inherent disadvantages in transport and logistics associated&#13;
with the fact that the Kyrgyz Republic is a landlocked country far from ports. Indeed, the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic is one of the most logistics-disadvantaged countries even among landlocked economies,&#13;
and it has failed to make substantial progress in improving logistics in the last decade (Figure 11).&#13;

23. Informality is also fueled on the supply side. Despite revisions in laws on internal migration,&#13;
there is evidence that the registration system for employment remains both complicated and&#13;
nontransparent. This especially impacts internal migrants from predominantly poor southern&#13;
regions to the urban north. Because of higher utility fees and associated fees, there are incentives&#13;
for landlords not to provide tenants with necessary documentation, hindering migrant registration&#13;
and legal employment. This provides a large pool of unregistered, cheap labor that feeds the&#13;
informal sector. Between 2003 and 2012, there was a fivefold increase in the share of industrial&#13;
employment outside the construction sector held by workers from other oblasts (regions), and,&#13;
among these internal migrants, the proportion working without a contract rose from 28 percent to&#13;
47 percent. In construction, a similar trend occurred whereby internal migrants accounted for 11&#13;
percent of construction jobs by 2012 (up from 3 percent), and, among these internal migrants, the&#13;
share working without a contract increased from 36 percent to 81 percent. Without registry in the&#13;
city, migrants not only have more limited access to higher-value formal sector employment, they&#13;
also have more limited access to medical treatment, education, and other basic services.&#13;
&#13;
EMPLOYMENT CREATION ON THE PATH TO GREATER GROWTH&#13;
&#13;
24.     The current model of growth has resulted in both employment insufficiency and&#13;
declining productivity and wage growth. Shifting to a higher job growth path will require&#13;
fundamental transformations in the sources of economic growth and jobs, which call for efforts&#13;
across several policy fronts. In addition to reducing the regulatory distortions that inhibit private&#13;
sector growth and employment, efforts will be needed to maintain an enabling environment for&#13;
export competitiveness through appropriate macroeconomic management and improvements in&#13;
transport and logistics, to ensure businesses are unshackled from the widespread prevalence of low-&#13;
level corruption, and to facilitate the utilization of remittances for domestic growth and&#13;
employment creation through greater financial intermediation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                xiii&#13;
&amp;#12;25.     Job growth in the formal sector is thwarted by regulations and a lack of competition.&#13;
Distortions in the patent and regulatory system and the costs associated with compliance that affect&#13;
especially small firms need to be addressed to reduce the current barriers to small-firm survival and&#13;
growth. The degree of concentration of output among a small number of large firms suggests there&#13;
are barriers to competition that impede the growth of business and jobs. Other obstacles to&#13;
operations may also exist that contribute to the lack of dynamism among firms.&#13;
&#13;
26.      Enabling the expansion of the export-oriented manufacturing sector will require&#13;
greater efforts to improve competitiveness. The influx of worker remittances into the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic has heightened the risks of Dutch Disease, which could hinder the expansion of exports.&#13;
Migration-sending countries can adopt a range of policies to offset the effects of remittance flows&#13;
on the equilibrium real exchange rate, or compensate the economyâ&#128;&#153;s traded goods sector for the&#13;
loss of competitiveness that it suffers from real exchange rate appreciation. Investment in the&#13;
export-oriented sectors (for example, improving transport and logistics infrastructure) could help&#13;
to increase productivity and drop costs for firms in the sector, helping offset the Dutch Disease&#13;
effect. These are examples of issues that can be explored as part of the Kyrgyz Republicâ&#128;&#153;s jobs&#13;
policy agenda.&#13;
&#13;
27.     The business environment can also be enabled through a concentrated reduction in&#13;
the facilitating factors behind corruption. The Kyrgyz Republic ranks higher than other&#13;
developing countries in Europe and Central Asia and even higher than the average among low-&#13;
income countries across a range of corruption indicators. One contributor to corruption is the&#13;
problematically low wages among public servants, which creates greater incentives for corruption.&#13;
If wages are unrealistically low, the incentives for gaining income through corruption increase,&#13;
thereby not only lowering the quality of public service, but significantly deterring formal sector&#13;
growth.&#13;
&#13;
28.     While remittances are well targeted to individual needs, their broader economic&#13;
impacts can be enhanced by reducing the costs of remittance transfers and better&#13;
intermediation. At present, only a small portion of remittances are transferred through formal&#13;
channels. Strengthening the financial intermediation of remittances can improve the ability of the&#13;
economy to mobilize savings and direct savings toward high-return projects, to improve the access&#13;
of formal remittance recipients to other financial products (thereby reducing risks), and to enable&#13;
policy makers to monitor and react more effectively to changes in remittance flows that could&#13;
impact poverty and job-creating investments. Table 1 illustrates a range of policy areas that should&#13;
be considered to create a more promising environment for the creation of jobs.&#13;

29.     The policy directions for improving jobs outcomes are multiple. To break out of the&#13;
migration trap, the Kyrgyz Republic will need to redirect its policy direction toward the creation of&#13;
more and higher value jobs domestically, which must come from an expanding and competitive&#13;
private sector. Table 1 outlines some of the major policy directions that can underpin more&#13;
effective domestic and external job creation.&#13;
&#13;
30.      â&#128;¦but the rewards are high. At present, jobs options for the majority of Kyrgyz workers&#13;
are largely limited to low-value (but better paid) migration opportunities and domestic work in low&#13;
value services. Expanding the pool of employment options domestically, driven by new engines&#13;
of growth, will reduce the vulnerabilities of Kyrgyz workers to external shocks, incentive&#13;
educational investments, and support continued favorable growth and poverty reduction prospects&#13;
for the Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;CHAPTER 1. THE CONTEXT FOR JOBS IN THE KYRGYZ&#13;
                  REPUBLIC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    A.    COUNTRY CONDITIONS SHAPING DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES&#13;
&#13;
1.1      The Kyrgyz Republicâ&#128;&#153;s jobs possibilities will be strongly influenced by its underlying&#13;
social and development context. The 2013 World Development Report4 highlights how key&#13;
underlying social, political, geographic and economic features will to a large extent dictate the jobs&#13;
challenges that confront countries. Youth bulge countries, not surprisingly, must deal with the&#13;
specific challenges of youth employment. Aging economies must confront rising age dependency&#13;
ratios and at times labor deficiencies. Conflict affected countries must continually square jobs&#13;
solutions on aggregate with the delicate balances needed to maintain peace and stability. The&#13;
typologies of countries with regards to jobs are not mutually exclusive. Countries face many&#13;
divergent challenges simultaneously. Understanding some of the key country features that have&#13;
impacted jobs outcomes to date and are likely to continue to exert influence over the future is a&#13;
priority in describing the jobs agenda.&#13;
&#13;
1.2     Several characteristics of the Kyrgyz economy are helpful entry points in&#13;
understanding recent jobs outcomes and future opportunities and challenges. These are: (1)&#13;
the countryâ&#128;&#153;s challenging geography and natural resources; (2) Long-standing spatial disparities;&#13;
and (3) the economic after-effects of the transition from Soviet central planning. In some sense&#13;
these are the structural features of jobs, as they represent the conditions with which the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic must contend in its search for jobs solutions.&#13;
&#13;
1.3      The Kyrgyz geography â&#128;&#147; both its location and topographic features â&#128;&#147; have shaped the&#13;
nature of economic activity. Rugged and remote, the Kyrgyz Republic is geographically&#13;
dominated by the Tien Shan mountain range, covering 95 percent of its territory. The rough&#13;
landscape has provided the country a set of natural resources as a base for economic activity, but it&#13;
has also limited the ability for the Kyrgyz Republic to exploit them fully (through resource use&#13;
intensification, surplus generation, reinvestment and trade) or to move beyond them. Inaccessibility&#13;
has increased costs for inputs and technology that might raise productivity at all levels.&#13;
Mountainous territories by their nature are characterized by a narrow set of resources on which to&#13;
draw, with limited possibilities for economies of scale. This rugged terrain has also increased the&#13;
costs associated with the public services delivery and infrastructure development such as transport&#13;
and ICT. This has not only further increased costs associated with production, it has contributed&#13;
to wide disparities across the country in terms of access to basic services (discussed below).&#13;
&#13;
1.4    The Kyrgyz Republic also suffers the disadvantages of small landlocked economies.&#13;
Smallness has increased the need for trade (to expand beyond its limited market). But its&#13;
remoteness within Central Asia and landlocked status increase the transport costs, weakening&#13;
competitiveness. Exports outside of gold and non-ferrous metals are constrained, with non-gold&#13;
merchandise exports accounting for on average 20 percent of GDP between 2010 and 2013. These&#13;

&amp;#12;disadvantages were partially masked under the Soviet command economy, as complex output and&#13;
supply arrangements ensured dependable trade networks and steady demand.&#13;
&#13;
1.5      Secondly, the Kyrgyz Republic is characterized by its long-standing spatial disparities&#13;
in economic welfare and economic activity. The north and the south of the country are divided&#13;
by mountain ranges, and there is socio-economic divisions between the north and south as well.&#13;
While poorer and predominantly rural south is linked more to its neighboring countries of&#13;
Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, the north borders Kazakhstan and is more closely connected to Russia.&#13;
In part stemming from the natural disadvantages of its rough topography (rendering access to many&#13;
services, from health to education to markets to infrastructure [see Figure 1.1], considerably more&#13;
difficult) large socio-economic disparities exist between rural and urban areas. Overall poverty in&#13;
rural areas is 41.4 percent (2013), compared with 28.5 in urban areas. While 70 of the population&#13;
in urban areas have access to improved sanitation facilities, in rural areas, the proportion is 8&#13;
percent5. Almost all measures of human opportunity show a wide divide between rural and urban&#13;
areas (see Figure .1.2).&#13;
&#13;
1.6     The ethnic and socio-economic division between the rural south and the north has on&#13;
occasions led to tensions which have had significant impact on the country's performance.6&#13;

1.7      Overlaying these economic and social disparities, differences in population and labor&#13;
dynamics between the north and south have heightened pressure for jobs and income for&#13;
workers in the south. The Kyrgyz Republicâ&#128;&#153;s population is young. The working age population7&#13;
increased by 2 percent over the 2003-2013 period, and this rate of growth is expected to continue&#13;
in the future (Figure 1.3). In rural areas, the working age population has grown faster than in urban&#13;
areas (1.2 percent a year over the past decade, compared 1 percent in urban areas), while domestic&#13;
job creation has been half as fast (0.5 percent a year versus 1 percent). Heightened growth of young&#13;
workers with significantly lower jobs prospects has created many of the pressures for migration out&#13;
of rural areas, both externally and internally to urban areas.&#13;

1.8      Finally, the Kyrgyz Republic is characterized by the both legacy of central planning&#13;
and the significant labor market after-effects of the difficult transition from that model. The&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic gained its independence as the second poorest country in the Commonwealth of&#13;
Independent States (CIS). Although it gained its independence almost 25 years ago, many of the&#13;
struggles confronting Kyrgyz labor markets have their roots in the difficult transition which all of&#13;
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) confronted following independence. The&#13;
disintegration of the Soviet systems plunged the Kyrgyz economy into collapse, with a complete&#13;
breakdown in supply chains and Soviet demand. The Soviet model had internally integrated all&#13;
Soviet production, such that production might involve the transport of inputs across vast geographic&#13;
distances. Once these elaborate cross-republic supply chains were disrupted, the Soviet market&#13;
demand for most of Kyrgyzâ&#128;&#153;s industrial outputs and agriculture collapsed. Over the 1990-1995&#13;
period, agricultural output fell by 26 percent, while industrial output was cut by more than two&#13;
thirds (Table 1.1).&#13;

                        B.    LABOR MARKETS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TRANSITION&#13;
&#13;
      1.9    The economic collapse associated with the disintegration of the Soviet system had&#13;
      several important and long-standing ramifications on Kyrgyz labor markets and&#13;
      employment:&#13;
&#13;
              (i) First, high unemployment emerged. The precipitous decline in GDP following&#13;
                  independence resulted in emerging and significant unemployment (Figure 1.4). The full&#13;
                  extent of unemployment was likely masked by labor hoarding in agriculture, withdrawal&#13;
                  from the labor force, and by low levels of unemployment registration. An estimate of&#13;
                  unemployment in other CIS countries in the early 2000s found that less than 20 percent of&#13;
                  unemployed persons actually registered. Even with these factors, official unemployment&#13;
                  as a share of the labor force in the Kyrgyz Republic grew to double digits in the first decade&#13;
                  following independence.&#13;

(ii) Second, the lack of jobs caused a shift of workers to agriculture as a means to survive,&#13;
    resulting in significant surplus labor on farms. The transition from the Soviet model&#13;
    resulted in mass privatization of large farms and distribution of private plots for large&#13;
    numbers of people. As privatization of state-owned industry resulted in widespread&#13;
    slashing of urban jobs, an urban to rural migration took place as people displaced from&#13;
    industry returned to their villages to farm, their only means of subsistence. While&#13;
    agriculture had been the main source of employment for less than a third of the population&#13;
    under the Soviet Union, by the early 2000s, agriculture was officially the main source of&#13;
    employment for about half of the labor force. However, with a collapse in the wool market,&#13;
    low levels of investment, and lack of imported feed, agricultural productivity had&#13;
    plummeted. Lack of financial resources for farm mechanization resulted in many of the&#13;
    newly acquired arable farm holdings being unable to produce crops. Lack of maintenance&#13;
    on infrastructure around remote summer pastures led to overgrazing pastures close to&#13;
    villages. Thus, while farming had become the main employment source for the country,&#13;
    the average output per worker in the sector was about 40 percent less than the average&#13;
    output per worker outside of agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
(iii) Third, the industrial sector contracted strongly, with sizeable job losses. A large&#13;
    number of inefficient enterprises had relied on government subsidies to remain operational&#13;
    under the Soviet system, but following independence and privatization, most were&#13;
    eventually closed. Over the 1990s, production declined in almost all industrial sectors,&#13;
    including power, engineering and metal work, and fuel, chemicals and petrochemicals.&#13;
    Only the minerals sector experienced real output growth, thanks to foreign investment in&#13;
    Kumtor gold mining company. In all, industrial output declined by almost three quarters.&#13;
    The industrial sector, which used to provide about a quarter of jobs in the 1990s (and 40&#13;
    percent of output), by early 2000s accounted for less than 15 percent of jobs (and only 25&#13;
    percent of output, down from about 40 percent in the 1990s).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              6&#13;
&amp;#12;(iv) Fourth, the labor model was shifted from a (largely guaranteed) regular wage&#13;
    employment model to predominantly irregular and self-employment. This shift was&#13;
    especially pronounced in agriculture and services, where the share of workers with a&#13;
    guaranteed wage fell from about 6 out of 10 workers in the 1990s to only 2 in 10 by the&#13;
    early 2000s. Kyrgyz employment has become predominantly informal, with employment&#13;
    outside of registered establishments and companies accounting for 70 percent of&#13;
    employment. This is a ratio higher than in all other CIS countries, and on par with&#13;
    informality in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
(v) Finally, and most importantly for jobs outcomes today, the erosion in living&#13;
   standards triggered by the economic collapse spurred a large-scale labor migration&#13;
   out of the Kyrgyz Republic. The lack of employment opportunities initiated a wave of&#13;
   migration out of the country, beginning in the early 2000s. Estimates of the extent of&#13;
   migration vary significantly, with estimates from household data suggesting a figure of&#13;
   about 250,000 migrants while unofficial sources put the figure at closer to 500,000- 1&#13;
   million (see Box 1.1). Within the span of a decade, the Kyrgyz Republic became the second&#13;
   highest remittance receiving economy in the world as a share of GDP, estimated at 32&#13;
   percent of GDP in 2013 (Figure 1.5).&#13;

&amp;#12;                Box 1.1: Accounting for Emigration from the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
 Getting an accurate estimate of migration from the Kyrgyz Republic is challenging. The Kyrgyz Integrated&#13;
 Household Survey provides two questionnaires that allow for a measurement of labor migrants. First, the&#13;
 household roster (questionnaire 1) that is collected in the first quarter of each year includes a question&#13;
 about household members who are present or absent in the household. If members are absent, the&#13;
 questionnaire inquires about the reason for the absence, including employment. If this is the reason for the&#13;
 absence, the individuals are classified as labor migrants. There are a couple of disadvantages to this&#13;
 approach. The biggest disadvantage is that absence for work is not specified as international or domestic&#13;
 work. Second, the roster is only completed once a year, which may bias seasonal labor migration.&#13;
&#13;
 The second source of information is the Labor Force Survey (questionnaire 4). In this survey, basic&#13;
 information, economic activity, and income information are recorded for household members aged 15 and&#13;
 over. Members who report they work abroad are classified as labor migrants. Other members of the&#13;
 household can report information about members who are labor migrants if these are absent. Virtually all&#13;
 labor migrants identified in the household roster in quarter 1 are also reported in quarter 1 of the Labor&#13;
 Force Survey.&#13;
&#13;
 Information on the characteristics of migrants is based on analysis of the data in the Labor Force Survey.&#13;
 Because there is no clear advantage in using the household roster to identify labor migrants, the Labor&#13;
 Force Survey is our key source for the identification of labor migrants and migrant households.&#13;
&#13;
 While the Labor Force Survey allows an analysis of the broad trends and characteristics of migration, there&#13;
 are limitations that may significantly bias downwards the estimates of the migration stock. It does not&#13;
 account for household members no longer considered household members, nor does it account for entire&#13;
 families that have migrated. Given the characteristics of migrants from the Kyrgyz Republic, the first&#13;
 limitation is significantly more important. Because migrants are generally young -- 20â&#128;&#147;30 years of age&#13;
 who often leave their birth households for employment, marriage, and the like, it is probable that a large&#13;
 portion of migrants are excluded. Additionally, the exclusion of seasonal migrantsâ&#128;&#148;who are not identified&#13;
 as emigrantsâ&#128;&#148;may significantly underestimate the true number of migrants. Thus, while the data of the&#13;
 Labor Force Survey show net migration at around 250,000, the Kyrgyz International Organization for&#13;
 Migration puts the figure at closer to 350,000, and the United Nations puts the migrant stock at around&#13;
 740,000, with about 575,000 living in Russia (2013). For analysis relying on the overall magnitude of&#13;
 migration (such as simulations of the total labor force, migrant and domestic), a conservative estimate of&#13;
 500,000 is employed.&#13;

1.10     Spatial disparity in economic prospects also spurred large scale internal migration.&#13;
Most migrants have come from the south, which has experienced significantly poorer job prospects&#13;
and higher rates of poverty (Figure 1.6). External migrants have predominantly found work in&#13;
Russia in construction or trade (with a sizeable degree of shuttle-traders, traveling by existing rail&#13;
lines to transport goods to Russia) or Kazakhstan (Figure 1.7). The exodus from the rural south&#13;
has also fueled a swelling of internal migrants into Bishkek, Osh and Jalal-Abad, which has fostered&#13;
the growing informality of urban employment.&#13;

                           C.   CONTEXT-SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS FOR JOBS IN THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC&#13;
&#13;
             1.11    All of these features have had an important role in explaining jobs developments in&#13;
             the past. The development model that has arisen in the Kyrgyz Republic has sprung from the seeds&#13;
             of a very severe economic collapse following independence from the Soviet Union. Were the&#13;
             geography different, the Kyrgyz Republic might have responded to the collapse with a redoubling&#13;
             of exports to neighboring countries with surplus cash. Surrounded as it was by other struggling&#13;
             countries, with deficient trade-related infrastructure, and dependent upon sovereign access, the&#13;
             response was workers leaving Kyrgyz altogether. Once that migration network has taken hold, it&#13;
             has become a condition that is no longer a development but is a feature of the country.&#13;
&#13;
             1.12     These key features of the country context must also underpin jobs solutions for the&#13;
             Kyrgyz Republic. Migration is a development and jobs phenomenon with which the Kyrgyz&#13;
             Republic will need to contend for the next several decades. Jobs solutions will need to recognize&#13;
             the many direct implications of a remittance-driven growth model on growth and job creation, and&#13;
             integrate this understanding into specific jobs strategies. Geography also narrows the possibilities&#13;
             for growth and jobs. A jobs agenda in the Kyrgyz Republic must look for jobs solutions that&#13;
             minimize the costs and maximize the advantages of a challenging geography and location. That&#13;
             may be through targeting more â&#128;&#156;geographically neutralâ&#128;&#157; economic activities, where transport&#13;
             comprises a smaller share of overall costs, by facilitating expansion of businesses in locations closer&#13;
             to cross-border trade routes, or by utilizing the geography as an asset. While these are sector-&#13;
             specific development issues, the jobs agenda cannot be viewed as separate from the development&#13;
             agenda.&#13;
&#13;
             1.13     The jobs diagnostic makes use of several benchmark country groupings based on&#13;
             important features affecting jobs. Throughout the report, the jobs diagnostic draws upon country&#13;
             groupings sharing similar country features to the Kyrgyz Republic (but varying depending upon&#13;
             the feature of importance). Because each country typology creates its own development frontier,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                          9&#13;
&amp;#12;these similar countries can provide a landscape in a sense of what has been achieved by the set of&#13;
countries with the same set of key structural features. Three features are particularly important for&#13;
benchmarking for the Kyrgyz Republic: its geographic challenges, its high level of out-migration,&#13;
and its transition from the Soviet-Union. The report deliberately draws upon countries at varying&#13;
stages of development, to consider at the broadest level the strategies for growth and jobs that&#13;
worked within these country context features.&#13;

      A.   GROWTH RESUMPTION AND POVERTY REDUCTION THROUGH LABOR EXODUS&#13;
&#13;
2.1     Following the grueling transition that accompanied independence from the Soviet&#13;
Union, the Kyrgyz Republic managed an unsteady recovery over the 2000s. A strong&#13;
economic liberalization, addressing price and subsidy reforms, privatization of state-owned&#13;
enterprises (SOEs), land reform, exchange rate liberalization, and other measures, along with robust&#13;
growth of remittances lifting domestic demand, helped the Kyrgyz Republic to recoup some of the&#13;
sizeable losses it had incurred immediately following independence. Between 2000 and 2013, the&#13;
economy managed to grow by a relatively robust rate of 4.5 percent per year. With widespread&#13;
income gains from both migration and the domestic demand it has fueled, the country has been able&#13;
to achieve significant gains in welfare and poverty reduction. Overall poverty fell from 68 percent&#13;
to 37 percent between 2003 and 2013, with rural poverty reduction driving the dramatic fall.&#13;
&#13;
2.2      Migration provided a new engine for growth. Underpinning the growth recovery was&#13;
a spectacular movement of workers, both abroad and internal. On the external front, and starting&#13;
in the mid 2000s, migration of Kyrgyz workers on a wide scale began to take root, with lack of jobs&#13;
and low salaries propelling workers to Russia for employment and study. Estimates of the extent&#13;
of migration vary between 500,000 and 1,000,000 workers abroad, with the peak of migration over&#13;
the 2006-2008 period. With this movement came higher incomes, a large portion of which were&#13;
transferred back home for savings and purchases ranging from housing to education expenses to&#13;
farm equipment to&#13;

                     2.4      Internal migration also contributed to the growth recovery. The disparity in welfare&#13;
                     between the largely urban northern oblasts and the rural south created a pocket of poor with both&#13;
                     higher rates of growth of the working age population and more limited jobs opportunities. The&#13;
                     ability for workers to move within the country, mostly from the south to the cities (about 60 percent&#13;
                     of internal migration has been inter-oblast), has also allowed the Kyrgyz Republic to relieve a&#13;
                     source of social pressures and instability. It is estimated that over the past two decades, internal&#13;
                     migrants in the Kyrgyz Republic reached 1.9 million, meaning that one in every three citizens of&#13;
                     the Kyrgyz Republic had changed his or her domestic residence at least once10.&#13;

                       The jobs gap may be larger than the domestic unemployment rate suggests, though, as the share of working&#13;
                     age inactive adults has also increased. This exit from the labor force may reflect a discouragement from job-&#13;
                     search, but remittances may also impact labor supply decisions.&#13;

&amp;#12;2.5     Remittances supported significant gains in poverty reduction. In addition to the direct&#13;
impact on households receiving remittances, the economic expansion that was fueled by&#13;
remittances has led to a massive movement out of poverty across all regions and demographics.&#13;
Not only has poverty been reduced across geography, it has fallen steadily for employed and&#13;
unemployed alike, as households have adjusted labor responsibilities with increased incomes from&#13;
migration. For households with a migrant abroad, the receipt of remittances accounted for almost&#13;
double the reduction in poverty over the 2008 to 2013 period (with lower levels of domestic&#13;
employment and lower domestic wages for those working contributing to some poverty worsening).&#13;

                                                       B.   KEY SHIFTS IN EMPLOYMENT&#13;
&#13;
2.6     A dominant feature of the Kyrgyz Development model was labor movement: across&#13;
space, across sectors, and across types of employment. A major shift involved family and small&#13;
farmers leaving agriculture. In part pushed by further deterioration of agricultural prospects through&#13;
overgrazing, large scale abandonment of unsustainable farm employment occurred, such that within&#13;
6 years, the share of the population employed in agriculture had declined from 45 percent to 30&#13;
percent, a decline of about 150,000 jobs (Figure 2.7).&#13;
&#13;
2.7     Many of these workers migrated abroad for work. The labor force statistics cannot&#13;
fully capture the extent of migration and likely heavily underestimate its presence for description&#13;
of migration estimates from the LFS). The LFS suggests an increase of external migration of more&#13;
than 4-fold between 2003 and 2012, from 45,000 to about 190,000. Other sources (including&#13;
estimates from host countries) reckon the amount of Kyrgyz migration in the range of 500,000 to&#13;
1,000,000 workers, though some of that migration is of very temporary in nature (for example day&#13;
trade). With a labor force of about 2.5 million workers, the migration phenomenon must be&#13;
considered exceptionally important.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    13&#13;

&#13;
2.8     But a large number of workers searched for alternative employment within the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic. A comparison of the official net emigration rates and the loss of jobs in&#13;
agriculture between 2003 and 2012 reveals that at least half the workers who left agriculture&#13;
remained in the Kyrgyz Republic, where they either joined the ranks of the unemployed and of the&#13;
inactive or found employment outside agriculture. The change in employment reported in sectors&#13;
outside agriculture strongly correlated with the share of agricultural jobs lost, minus the share&#13;
represented by emigration. This suggests that a large pool of workers seeking employment outside&#13;
agriculture did so within the country.&#13;
&#13;
2.9     Remittances fueled jobs growth in services and construction. As remittances fueled&#13;
domestic demand for services and housing, new jobs expanded significantly in both sectors. While&#13;
about 150,000 jobs were shed in agriculture between 2003 and 2012, about 275,000 jobs on net&#13;
were created in construction and services (a growth of about 40 percent).&#13;
&#13;
Employment shifts largely reflected movement of the poor&#13;
&#13;
2.10     The structural shift was primarily a movement of the poor, to other jobs, other&#13;
regions, and other countries. The key sectoral shift was from agriculture to off farm work. In&#13;
2003, about 54 percent of all poor workers were engaged in agriculture, while by 2012 only about&#13;
37 percent of poor employed workers were in agriculture. But the movement of the poor has had&#13;
spatial and formality dimensions, too. Poorer households have disproportionately contributed to&#13;
the migration phenomenon. About one in every four families have an external migrant, but for&#13;
poor families, that figure is closer to one in every three families. Internal migration of the poor has&#13;
been even more prevalent, with about two in every five families having a household member&#13;
employed in an oblast other than their place of birth. This dynamic movement has not occurred at&#13;
nearly the level for non-poor workers.&#13;
&#13;
2.11   This movement of workers raised wages and labor incomes. This movement of the&#13;
economically disenfranchised had significant impact on overall wage and labor income growth.&#13;
Between 2003 and 2012, real wages rose by almost 9 percent a year, as the flow of remittances into&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  14&#13;
&amp;#12;the economy buoyed spending and the growth of services which pulled wages economy-wide.&#13;
Overall wages grew not only because of wage growth within each sector, but also because of the&#13;
shift of workers out of (low wage) agriculture to services. This provided early gains in wage&#13;
growth, which have only recently dissipated (Figure 2.6).&#13;

2.12     The movement of poor, rural workers heightened informality within sectors. An interesting&#13;
consequence of the movement of largely poor, rural farmers was the movement of informality from&#13;
rural agriculture to other sectors. Although in aggregate, informality in the Kyrgyz Republic has&#13;
remained broadly unchanged since the early 2000s, at the sectoral level informality has increased&#13;
significantly, as the movement out of (almost entirely informal) agriculture was balanced by a&#13;
growing informality in industry and services (Figure 2.7). Manufacturing and construction have&#13;
experienced particularly large increases in informality, driving up the overall industrial informality&#13;
rate to more than 75 percent of employment from less than 50 percent (Figure 2.8).&#13;

2.13    Registration requirements for employment heightened informality. Fueling the&#13;
growth of informality was a complex regulatory environment for non-resident employment.&#13;
Despite its Law on Internal Migration, the Kyrgyz residential registration system remains a&#13;
modified version of the Soviet Propiska system, requiring employees to have official residential&#13;
status. The process by which residential status is both complicated and non-transparent, with a&#13;
high degree of discretion in required procedures, and there are incentives for landlords not to&#13;
provide tenants with the required documents. As a result, many internal migrants don't register,&#13;
and thus cannot be legally employed. This alone has allowed for large pools of unregistered, cheap&#13;
labor feeding the informal sector of the economy. A study by the American University of Central&#13;
Asia11 corroborates this finding, noting that internal migrants are systematically more likely to&#13;
engage informal activities, hindered in part by registry requirements (Figure 2.10). The situation&#13;
not only impacts job prospects but welfare. Without registry in the city, migrants have more limited&#13;
access to medical treatment, access to education, and other basic services.&#13;

&amp;#12;The migration model impacted participation and educational decisions&#13;
&#13;
2.14    Migration increased male participation, while female labor force participation&#13;
declined. The movement of work outside of the Kyrgyz Republic had palpable effects on the&#13;
domestic labor force, with strong gender dimension. Male labor force participation has increased&#13;
(from 72 to 76 percent), and as females have had to adjust to household members working abroad,&#13;
their own labor participation declined. The share of working age women engaged in household&#13;
work or child rearing rose steeply from 16 percent to 26 percent over the decade, a phenomenon&#13;
consistent with other migration-dependent economies in the region. Of the migration-dependent&#13;
economies in the CIS (Armenia, Tajikistan, Moldova, and the Kyrgyz Republic), all have&#13;
demonstrated a decline in the participation of women, sometimes dramatic, while all other CIS&#13;
economies have exhibited an increase in female labor force participation (Figure 2.10).&#13;

Migration has led to reductions in secondary school completion. As men have increased their&#13;
participation to respond to new work opportunities abroad, the age of first time work has reduced,&#13;
and secondary school completion has dropped. The decision to leave school early for opportunities&#13;
abroad has been particularly prevalent for poor workers, where between 2004 and 2007, the labor&#13;
force participation rate for young workers increased from 72 to 76 percent, while the proportion&#13;
with incomplete secondary education grew from five percent to eleven percent (Figure 2.11).&#13;

            C.   GROWTH, PRODUCTIVITY AND WAGE IMPLICATIONS OF THE MODEL&#13;
&#13;
The sources of growth turned inward&#13;
&#13;
2.15    Growth turned inward. The inflow of remittances was channeled primarily into&#13;
consumption, investment, and imported goods. Total consumption rose by an average of 19 percent&#13;
a year between 2005 and 2013, and, by 2013, it averaged 135 percent of GDP, up from around 90&#13;
percent in 2001. Investment also increased dramatically, going from about 12 percent of GDP in&#13;
2003 to 35 percent in 2012. The bulk of the expansion in consumption and investment was centered&#13;
on households and went to finance childrenâ&#128;&#153;s education, health care, and residential housing&#13;
construction.&#13;
&#13;
2.16     Tradeables declined considerably as a source of growth and revenue. Many of the&#13;
classic symptoms of â&#128;&#156;Dutch Diseaseâ&#128;&#157; accompanied the migration driven growth model. The inflow&#13;
of remittances has created a foreign exchange surplus, triggering an exchange appreciation. With&#13;
that, there has been a considerable slowdown in manufacturing growth, and a rapid acceleration in&#13;
service sector growth. Between 2005 and 2012, manufacturing output declined by 2.3 percent a&#13;
year (a 17 percent decline over the period), while the services sector expanded in real terms by 8.9&#13;
percent a year (60 percent overall).&#13;

      Early productivity gains, but strong declines in industry&#13;
&#13;
      2.17     Initial productivity gains subsided. Initial movements of surplus labor out of agriculture&#13;
      resulted in strong productivity improvements. Over the 2005-2012 period, employment in the&#13;
      agriculture sector declined by 25 percent. With very low initial productivity levels in agriculture,&#13;
      movement to other forms of employment - even very low-value informal activities - had the effect&#13;
      of raising overall labor productivity (and, accordingly, wages and labor income). However, since&#13;
      2009, there has been no further productivity growth from labor reallocation. Productivity growth&#13;

&amp;#12;itself has dropped strongly, from more than 7 percent a year between 2005 and 2009 to less than 1&#13;
percent a year since 2009 (Figure 2:16).&#13;
&#13;
2.18    Relative to other CIS countries, Kyrgyz export growth has deteriorated sharply.&#13;
Although the Kyrgyz Republic managed strong export growth in the early 2000s, since 2008,&#13;
Kyrgyz exports have declined by about a half a percentage point a year, trailing far behind the&#13;
positive rate of growth of exports of goods and services observed in most of the other CIS countries&#13;
(where export growth averaged 7 percent a year in real terms). Merchandise goods export growth&#13;
has been slower still. Whereas in 2009 goods accounted for 72 percent of the Kyrgyz Republicâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
exports, by 2013 they made up just 58 percent.&#13;

&amp;#12;2.19     Current productivity growth has been limited to the service sector, itself concentrated&#13;
in transport and communications. Strong output growth in the service sector supported&#13;
increasing productivity (averaging almost 9 percent a year) as well as employment. However, the&#13;
bulk of the growth in service sector output can be attributed to a dramatic increase in transport and&#13;
communications. While transport and communications accounts for only about 15 percent of&#13;
services sector employment, real output growth averaging almost 25 percent a year over the period&#13;
drove about two thirds of the average annual real output growth in the services sector overall.&#13;
Underpinning this stellar growth has been penetration of new communications technologies,&#13;
including mobile telecommunications and internet, supported by expanding private sector demand.&#13;
Outside of T&amp;C, however, performance in the service sector has been more modest, supporting&#13;
relatively low productivity growth (averaging less than 1 percent a year between 2005-2012), and&#13;
modest employment advances (averaging 2 percent a year). Thus, while the services sector as a&#13;
whole has experienced robust productivity growth, it has largely been limited to the transport and&#13;
communications sector, and has not been accompanied by strong employment growth (Table 2.2)&#13;

2.20    Productivity has declined strongly in the industrial sector. The inflow of remittances&#13;
supported a boom in demand for housing, leading to a large number of new jobs in construction.&#13;
With productivity in the construction sector about half that of other industrial activities (mining,&#13;
manufacturing and utilities), the growth in construction has lowered the overall productivity of the&#13;
industrial sector (Figure 2.17). But beyond a changing structure, the industrial sector has been&#13;
marked by heavy declining in manufacturing productivity, which has fallen almost 6 percent a year&#13;
over the later 2000s to 2012.&#13;
&#13;
2.21     Productivity has been dragged by informality. A comparison of economy-wide&#13;
productivity estimates with productivity estimates from the formal sector suggests that informality&#13;
has been a significant factor in the deteriorating productivity growth both at the national level and&#13;
particularly within the industrial sector. Formal sector data from firms (examined more closely in&#13;
the following chapter) suggests that aggregate productivity growth in the formal sector has been&#13;
strong, averaging 6.7 percent a year since 2009. Economy wide, however, productivity growth&#13;

                                                    21&#13;
&amp;#12;averaged less than 1 percent a year, hinting at significant productivity declines emanating from the&#13;
informal sector. The formal/full economy productivity differential is particularly large in the&#13;
industrial sector (Figure 2.18), where informality has risen strongly. The results suggest that both&#13;
rising informalization (and productivity declines within the informal sector) are strongly impacting&#13;
overall productivity.&#13;

&amp;#12; D.    LIMITED DEVELOPMENT OF A FORMAL PRIVATE SECTOR&#13;
&#13;
2.22    The migration-led growth model has not allowed for the expansion of the formal&#13;
private sector. The formal sector is small in the Kyrgyz Republic, and within the formal sector,&#13;
public sector dominates employment. Statistics on public employment from the National Statistics&#13;
Office suggest that public sector employment accounts for only 17 percent of overall employment&#13;
--about in keeping with OECD levels. However, as a proportion of formal employment, public&#13;
sector employment accounts for a full 60 percent.&#13;

2.23    There has been limited development of formal private sector jobs. The corollary to the&#13;
figure above is that only 40 percent of establishment employment â&#128;&#147; and 11 percent of overall&#13;
employment â&#128;&#147; takes place in formal private sector establishments. While a comprehensive&#13;

&amp;#12;accounting of employment in the formal private sector across countries is not easily obtained,&#13;
piecing together information from a few studies across countries suggests that formal sector&#13;
employment outside the public sector accounts for a very low share of employment relative to&#13;
almost all countries. Among CIS economies where estimates could be made, the share of&#13;
employment generated in the formal private sector in the Kyrgyz republic is the lowest among all&#13;
countries (Figure 2.19).&#13;

&#13;
Core development challenges with respect to jobs&#13;
2.24     Domestic jobs growth has been insufficient to provide employment for the fast&#13;
growing labor supply. At the aggregate level, economic growth over the decade has been&#13;
"jobless" with the employment elasticity of growth just 0.1 (with the average annual growth of real&#13;
output of 4.7 percent resulting in an increase in domestic employment of just 0.5 percent). Current&#13;
rates of unemployment, combined with large numbers of workers employed abroad and relatively&#13;
rapid labor force growth will make it unlikely that the Kyrgyz Republic can provide sufficient&#13;
domestic employment opportunities for all its workers for the foreseeable future. Even assuming&#13;
a healthy rate of employment creation capacity of growth of 0.6 percent12, with an estimated half&#13;
million workers abroad and another quarter million unemployed, and with labor force growth&#13;
averaging 1.3 percent a year, even if economic growth were to average 5 percent a year, there would&#13;
be insufficient numbers of jobs created for the domestic labor force and those currently working&#13;
abroad at least for the next fifteen years (Figure 2.20).&#13;

                                    Domestic employment, high case*          Labor force + estimated migrants abroad&#13;
     Source: Staff estimates from UN and Kyrgyz LFS (estimates of current unemployment and domestic&#13;
     labor force). Migrants abroad was estimated at 500,000 workers, a figure between 250,000 estimated&#13;
     migrants from the Kyrgyz LFS (See Box 1.1), and the UN estimate of about 750,000. Employment&#13;
     growth is estimated at 3% a year, assuming an optimistic average GDP growth rate of 5% a year and an&#13;
     average employment elasticity of 0.6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12&#13;
   The overall employment elasticity of 0.1 is likely far below the employment/growth relationship going&#13;
forward, as the figure largely reflects the significant labor shedding that has continued in agriculture which&#13;
may be beginning to wane. An employment elasticity of 0.6 reflects the past employment elasticity outside&#13;
of agriculture (with job growth averaging 3.9 percent a year and output growth averaging 6.6 percent a year).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                      24&#13;
&amp;#12;2.25    Secondly, productivity growth has been low relative to other CIS economies. The&#13;
remittance-financed growth model yielded early productivity gains, with workers moving out of&#13;
subsistence agriculture to work in services and industry (primarily construction). But while&#13;
continuing growth in services has supported productivity growth (though concentrated in a few&#13;
sub-sectors), most other sectors - including manufacturing, mining, and electricity have all&#13;
experienced large declines in productivity over the decade. Overall, productivity growth fell from&#13;
about 7 percent a year between 2005 and 2009 to about 0.7 percent a year since 2009, significantly&#13;
below the productivity growth of Kyrgyz's neighbors (Figure 2.21).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
2.26     Thirdly, real wage growth exceeds productivity growth, weakening competitiveness.&#13;
Real wages have grown by 10 percent a year since 2005, driven by strong wage growth in both&#13;
construction and services. Productivity growth, on the other hand, has averaged less than 5 percent&#13;
a year. The difference between wage growth and productivity growth has been particularly high in&#13;
the tradables sectors, weakening external competitiveness. Real wages in agriculture averaged 17&#13;
percent a year, compared with 4 percent a year productivity growth. Manufacturing wages&#13;
increased by an average of 6 percent a year compared with productivity declines averaging 4&#13;
percent. This could be a symptom of labor shortages developing from both internal and external&#13;
migration. The general rise in wages in tradeables without accompanying productivity growth is&#13;
concerning because it signals a further weakening of external competitiveness (Figure 2.22).&#13;

&#13;
2.27    Fourth, the geographic concentration of migration exposes the Kyrgyz employment&#13;
model to risks. Kyrgyz migrants have been primarily young men working in Russia. Over 85&#13;
percent of the emigration has been accounted for by only two countries (Russia and Kazakhstan),&#13;
making the migration model vulnerable to particular country changes either in economic conditions&#13;
(necessitating labor inflows) or in immigrant labor regulations. Indeed, the Russian Federal&#13;
Migration Serviceâ&#128;&#153;s new requirement that, by 2015, all citizens of CIS countries outside the&#13;
Eurasian Customs Union who desire to enter Russia must have valid international passports made&#13;
the accession of the Kyrgyz Republic to the customs union almost inevitable. With much of the&#13;
domestic growth model fueled by the remittances received from these two countries, overall&#13;
vulnerability is compounded.&#13;
&#13;
2.28    Finally, the presence of migration has also reduced the imperative for domestic job&#13;
growth. With migration to buffer jobs deficiencies, unemployment has remained relatively stable&#13;
even as the size of the labor force has expanded rapidly. However, the seemingly limitless&#13;
availability of temporary jobs abroad, along with robust consumer demand, may have also dulled&#13;
the urgency to create more and better-paying jobs domestically for the labor force. In this way,&#13;
migration serves as a disincentive to job-creating structural reforms.&#13;
&#13;
2.29    Formulating strategies for improved jobs outcomes requires a deeper investigation of&#13;
micro-level data, with a focus on a formal firms. Thus, using micro level data, we are interested&#13;
in exploring the dynamics of growth, productivity, employment creation and labor compensation&#13;
in formal establishments to better understand the decline of the formal industrial sector and the&#13;
changing formal sector structure. It is through this understanding that constraints to formal sector&#13;
job creation can be identified. The following two chapters take a deeper examination into worker&#13;
and work, utilizing the household, labor force, and enterprise level data collected in the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;   CHAPTER 3. GROWTH, PRODUCTIVITY AND&#13;
COMPENSATION DYNAMICS FROM FIRM LEVEL DATA&#13;
                 ANALYSIS&#13;
&#13;
3.1      Though the formal sector accounts for only about 30 percent of employment in the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic, it is important in overall employment outcomes. To begin, the formal sector&#13;
accounts for a majority of output that is produced in the economy. For example, it is estimated that&#13;
formal establishments account for almost 70 percent of gross value added in the Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
Secondly, it is generally is the source of the better paying, more productive jobs. Thus,&#13;
understanding the constraints it faces is important for improving the better quality jobs. Related,&#13;
although the formal sector generally employs a lower proportion of the poor and the bottom 40&#13;
percent of the population than the informal sector, formal establishments still provide employment&#13;
for a significant number of the less well off. Thus, in its own right, improving the job prospects in&#13;
the formal sector can directly improve the labor incomes of the poor. Fourth, informal sector&#13;
growth is often closely linked to performance in the formal sector. The development of new formal&#13;
industries, for example, often paves the path for ancillary and supporting services that may remain&#13;
informal. As a result, improving the performance of formal industries can be the most effective&#13;
path for improving income prospects outside of the formal sector. This section assesses the&#13;
performance of formal establishments in creating jobs utilizing a dataset created for this report,&#13;
based upon the financial reports of establishments (Box 3-1).&#13;
&#13;
3.2      Despite the growth recovery over the 2000s, the Kyrgyz Republic has failed to create&#13;
good jobs outcomes. Job creation is not keeping pace with the growth in the labor force. The value&#13;
of the jobs being created is improving only marginally, with low productivity and wage growth.&#13;
Moreover, jobs are not sufficiently inclusive: there is a dualism and a tension in the jobs market&#13;
between the formal sector and the informal sector, and the transition between these two sectors is&#13;
difficult.&#13;
&#13;
3.3      A closer look at the formal sector suggests it has fallen short in all three indicators of&#13;
jobs success, but most severely with regard to job growth. Formal sector labor demand is muted.&#13;
Formal private sector firm growth is stunted among small firms, limiting productivity growth and&#13;
small firm job creation. Meanwhile, the growth of the formal sector has been concentrated among&#13;
a few large firms with significant market power and scale economies which have not created jobs&#13;
on net. While formal sector productivity growth has been substantial, it has been concentrated&#13;
among a few firms. Wages have grown in aggregate, but this growth has few demonstrated links&#13;
to productivity growth. The aggregate picture of the formal sector is one of limited job and&#13;
productivity growth, and wage growth that is unaligned with productivity growth.&#13;
&#13;
3.4     Behind these factors are constraints on private sector growth and job creation. These&#13;
include complex, costly labor regulations affecting medium size firms, the array of advantages for&#13;
large, sometimes loss-making firms, and the low rates of firm entry in particular job-intensive&#13;
industries. Most employment growth is occurring in the large, generally less productive informal&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
3.5     Export-oriented manufacturing is particularly impeded from stronger growth. While,&#13;
in aggregate, the rate of entry of establishments into the formal sector is high, particular sectors,&#13;
such as export-oriented manufacturing, exhibit significantly lower rates of firm entry. Given the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 27&#13;
&amp;#12;job-creation capacity of export-oriented manufacturing (on average, firms create 29 jobs), lack of&#13;
entry into this sector is particularly troublesome for jobs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Box 3-1: A description of the Kyrgyz Establishment Reports (KER) dataset&#13;
&#13;
     Kyrgyz Establishments Reports (KER) is a database compiled for this jobs report from mandatory&#13;
     statements that all establishments registered in the Kyrgyz Republic are required to submit, either on&#13;
     an annual or quarterly basis. Officially, the full financial reports include all establishments in the&#13;
     Kyrgyz Republic, but the forms completed differ by establishment type (with some variation in the&#13;
     requested information for non-profit establishments, small establishments, financial institutions, etc.).&#13;
     The data made available for this analysis include data from the Report on the Key Financial Indicators&#13;
     of the Enterprise (annual and quarterly); Statement of Sources and Uses of Funds (non-profit&#13;
     establishments); Statement of the Costs of Production and Distribution of Products, Works, Services of&#13;
     the Enterprise; Consolidated Report on Denationalization and Privatization of State Property; Report&#13;
     on Results of Issue and Subscription of Securities; and, Report on Key Performance Indicators of Small&#13;
     Businesses.&#13;
     While the official reports submitted by establishments include all organizations and establishments,&#13;
     regardless of size, ownership structure, sector, or profit-making status, a smaller subset of these&#13;
     financial reports for the period 2009-2012 was provided for the purpose of this analysis. It includes all&#13;
     establishments with the exception of (i) financial institutions; (ii) public administration establishments;&#13;
     (iii) several large establishments whose identity could be compromised (in particular, the gold mining&#13;
     sector and railroads). These missing sectors account for approximately half of the establishment&#13;
     employment over the period (with a large proportion in public administration). The KER provides&#13;
     detailed information related to firm performance and employment, including inter alia: sales and&#13;
     expenses from which to calculate value added, profit, and the like; investment; and employment, man-&#13;
     hours and labor compensation. Information is also collected by which it is possible to determine each&#13;
     establishment's ownership structure, geographic location, main economic activity and, to some degree,&#13;
     age.&#13;
     By virtue of several common identifier variables in the KER data (including its location and its sector)&#13;
     it is possible to broadly link the analysis of the firms to labor supply from the LFS (which also identifies&#13;
     workers who work in establishments, by location and main economic activity). The LFS is not designed&#13;
     to be representative at the sector level, and so caution needs to be applied in interpreting results. But&#13;
     the linking of labor characteristics to firm decisions on hiring and growth provides added insight into&#13;
     the potential impacts of particular job-growth strategies.&#13;

    A. A SNAPSHOT OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE FORMAL SECTOR&#13;
&#13;
      The formal sector differs strongly from the informal sector&#13;
&#13;
3.6     The formal sector is largely urban. While overall employment is distributed relatively&#13;
evenly across oblasts, the majority of formal sector jobs (and establishments) are urban. Outside&#13;
Bishkek, where about half of overall employment occurs outside enterprises, informality dominates&#13;
employment by a wide margin. This is evident in data on total employment in rural areas versus&#13;
employment in registered establishments (Error! Reference source not found.and Error!&#13;
ference source not found.).&#13;

&#13;
3.7      Formal sector employment is predominantly in large enterprises, while informal&#13;
employment is mostly in small activities. More than 60 percent of employment in the formal&#13;
sector takes place in firms with 50 or more workers, and more than a third of employment takes&#13;
place in firms with over 200 workers (Figure 3.3). Outside of the formal sector, however, most&#13;
employment is in very small activities. For the broader economy, the Kyrgyz LFS suggests that 60&#13;
percent of domestic employment (formal and informal) takes place in firms with five workers or&#13;
fewer, and only 6 percent in organizations of more than 60 workers (Figure 3.4). The difference in&#13;
the picture of employment in formal sector versus the broader economy is evidence of the smallness&#13;
of scale of informal activities13.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13 Some of the difference between the proportion of workers employed in small firms according to establishment reports&#13;
versus what is suggested economy wide might be attributed to underreporting of employment by small formal firms (that&#13;
is, it is possible that the formal sector may also be small in nature, with much more employment taking place in small&#13;
firms than reported). While underreporting employment (to social security) and sales (for tax purposes) is common among&#13;
registered establishments, smaller firms tend to underreport more than larger firms. Cross-country evidence has found&#13;
the degree of underreporting (the fraction of employment and/or sales not reported) to be about twice as high in small&#13;
firms than in large firms. . Even doubling of the number of employees for all small establishments in the KER&#13;
establishment sample would only raise the share of small firm employment in total employment to about 13%, far from&#13;
what is suggested economy-wide. This would suggest that what is not covered by the KER â&#128;&#147; employment outside of&#13;
registered establishments â&#128;&#147; is even more heavily dominated by micro and very small (less than 5 workers) activities and&#13;
establishments.&#13;

3.8     There is a significant difference in the sectoral composition of employment for formal&#13;
versus informal sectors. Sectors which account for significant employment in the formal sector&#13;
are almost not present in the informal sector, including public administration (11 percent of formal&#13;
employment and fully formal), education (accounting for 30 percent of formal employment, versus&#13;
1 percent of informal employment), and health/social services (accounting for 12 percent of formal&#13;
employment and only 1 percent of informal employment). Likewise, informal employment is&#13;
dominated by agriculture and trade, as well as construction, which combined account for 70 percent&#13;
of informal employment, and only 10 percent of formal employment.&#13;
&#13;
3.9      Related, there are large sectoral differences in the level of informality. Table 3.1&#13;
highlights the share of employment in the sector accounted for by registered establishments14.&#13;
Formal agriculture employment not surprisingly accounts for a very limited proportion of overall&#13;
employment in the sector. But many other sectors are also highly informal, particularly in the&#13;
services sector, and these sectors tend to dominate the smaller scale employment in the formal&#13;
establishments. Employment in the hotels and restaurant sector is dominated by non-registered&#13;
employment (employment not reported by registered establishments), as is wholesale and retail&#13;
trade and construction. Among the sectors in which employment is heavily formal, other services&#13;
leads the list, largely reflecting public administration (which is fully formal) (see Figure 3.5).&#13;

&amp;#12;3.10    The workers themselves differ, with significantly higher education levels in the formal&#13;
sector. Formal sector workers are more likely to be well educated, and less likely to be uneducated.&#13;
The LFS data provides an estimate of the education levels of workers being employed in the modern&#13;
sector. On average, half of all workers in urban establishments have a tertiary education, versus&#13;
only one in five outside the formal sector (and only 13 percent in rural areas). And the share of&#13;
only-primary educated workers is disproportionately employed outside the modern sector. In both&#13;
the urban informal sector and rural areas, 10 percent of workers have completed only primary&#13;
school, versus only 3 percent in urban establishments (Figure 3.6).&#13;

3.11     â&#128;¦and significantly lower rates of poverty among the formal sector workers. Though&#13;
the KER establishment sample does not provide information on household income levels of&#13;
employees, it is possible to get a closer gauge on the types of workers employed in the formal sector&#13;
by looking at the characteristics of those employed in establishments versus others from the Kyrgyz&#13;
LFS. From the LFS, workers in urban establishments exhibit a household poverty rate of 13&#13;
percent, versus 34 percent outside of establishments. The household poverty rate gap between&#13;
working in establishments and outside establishments is particularly high in the industrial sector,&#13;
where in manufacturing and construction the poverty rate for those employed outside&#13;
establishments is estimated to be 3.5-3.7 times that of those working within (Table 3.2).&#13;

    Job growth patterns among formal sector establishments&#13;
&#13;
3.12     Over the 2009-2012 period, the formal sector experienced economic growth, but very&#13;
little job growth. On average, growth averaged more than 6.6 percent a year in real terms in the&#13;
formal establishments represented in the KER establishment data. That compares with job growth&#13;
averaging less than 0.4 percent a year (Figure 3.3). The bulk of job growth has come not from&#13;
value-creating private sector firms (who account for two thirds of employment), but from non-&#13;
profits and state-owned enterprises, despite the fact that state owned enterprises realized losses over&#13;
the period (Table 3.3). While private sector, for profit firms saw productivity growth of more than&#13;
7 percent a year, on average they shed jobs at a rate of 0.5 percent a year since 2009.&#13;

  3.13     The majority of job growth in the formal sector came from new firms. The KER data&#13;
  does not provide information on age of the establishment, but based on when the establishment is&#13;
  recorded in the sample, it is possible to determine those establishments which entered after 200915.&#13;
  Using this gauge, entering firms created more about 60 percent of all the jobs created by&#13;
  establishments over the 2009-2012 period. Entrants created more than 32,000 jobs between 2009&#13;
  and 2012, while established enterprises shed more than 35,000 jobs â&#128;&#147; or about 16 percent of the&#13;
  jobs that existed at the start of the sample in 2009.&#13;
&#13;
  3.14    Jobs were lost through firm exit, but also through labor shedding of surviving firms.&#13;
  Of the 47,000 jobs shed by both exiting establishments and surviving establishments, about a third&#13;
  of them came from firms that continued to operate. These surviving companies shed labor at a rate&#13;
  of almost 3 percent a year over the 2009-2012 period. While the bulk of these job-shedding&#13;
  companies experienced negative output growth, a large share of growing companies also shed&#13;
  labor. Among growing establishments, about 60 percent of companies reduced their work forces,&#13;
  accounting for almost 20 percent of the job losses by all establishments over the period.&#13;
&#13;
  3.15    At the sectoral level, while manufacturing has contributed the most to output growth,&#13;
  it has also shed the most labor. Manufacturing accounted for the bulk of output growth, along&#13;
  with wholesale and retail trade and transport and communications (Figure 3.7). Job growth was&#13;
  limited across the board, but agriculture experienced strong growth in formal employment from its&#13;
  very low initial base, the result of several large poultry, dairy and crop growing establishments&#13;
  beginning operations after 2009. Services also experienced modest job growth, particularly from&#13;
&#13;
  15&#13;
     Some caution must be exercised in this interpretation, however, as there is the potential for firms to drift&#13;
  in and out of operational status (so called zombie firms), and entry may reflect a large portion of firms which&#13;
  were in existence prior to 2009.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        34&#13;
&amp;#12;wholesale and retail trade and several sectors heavily populated with non-profit institutions,&#13;
including community services and education. The greatest job losses for the economy came from&#13;
manufacturing, where more than 4,200 jobs were shed (about 9 percent of manufacturing jobs in&#13;
2009). Not only did exiting firms contribute to the loss of manufacturing jobs, but job shedding by&#13;
surviving incumbent firms also contributed heavily. About 6,775 manufacturing jobs were lost in&#13;
establishments which remained in operation between 2009 and 2012 - a decline in employment of&#13;
more than 15 percent (Figure 3.7)&#13;

&amp;#12;          The relationship between firm size and employment growth&#13;
&#13;
3.16    Firm size has played a large role in Kyrgyzâ&#128;&#153;s job creation, with small firms unable to&#13;
grow (and thus expand employment) and large firms growing strongly with low levels of&#13;
employment creation. Analysis of job creation by the life-cycle of the firm and by firm size&#13;
provides several important insights into firm growth and job creation. Annex 1 presents the results&#13;
of regression analysis of net job creation in Kyrgyz Republic over the 2009-2012 period, with a&#13;
view to better understanding the relationship between job growth and firm size, as well as to&#13;
determine other factors that influence the overall job creation.&#13;
&#13;
3.17     The formal sector exhibits a considerable amount of churning, without any job&#13;
growth. Table 3.4 indicates the rates of entry at each firm size. Aggregate entry is very high, at&#13;
about 20 percent over the 4 years (that is, about 20 percent of the firms in the sample entered after&#13;
2009). Entrants created employment across all firm sizes (the majority of employment being&#13;
created by large entrants), but once theyâ&#128;&#153;ve entered, firms in aggregate have difficulties surviving&#13;
and expanding (particularly small and medium firms). The greatest churning comes from small&#13;
and medium firms, with significant barriers to small firms growing to medium sized, and significant&#13;
barriers to medium sized firms staying medium sized (with the highest probability of shrinking&#13;
across age group).&#13;

3.18    The probability of job growth and survival for large firms is much higher than for&#13;
small and medium sized establishments.              Figure 3.9 displays the evolution of growth in&#13;
employment by initial firm size. Column sections show the number of jobs provided (in 2009 and&#13;
2012) by firms that grew or shrank to a particular size category in 2012. The column section&#13;
designated â&#128;&#156;exitâ&#128;&#157; in 2009, for example, reflects the total employment in 2009 in firms which&#13;
eventually exited by 2012. Several interesting features emerge from this breakdown.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       36&#13;
&amp;#12;             3.19     Small firms have high rates of exit, while medium size firms have a high probability&#13;
             for shrinking. Jobs in small firms have the highest rates of loss through exit, suggesting difficulty&#13;
             of survival for small entrants. Of the more than 25,000 small firm jobs that existed in 2009, for&#13;
             example, more than 5,000 were jobs that would be lost by 2012 because of firm exit. Medium&#13;
             sized firms, meanwhile, exhibit the highest rates of reversal to smaller size, in addition to fairly&#13;
             high rates of exit (about 4,300 of the 37,000 jobs in medium firms in 2009 would be lost due to&#13;
             firm exit). The reversal to smaller size is reflected in the fact that of the 37,000 jobs in medium&#13;
             sized firms in 2009, about 6,000 would be lost to firms shrinking in employment size (shedding&#13;
             labor)16.&#13;
&#13;
             3.20    Small firms donâ&#128;&#153;t grow. Figure 3.10 shows the dynamics of firm growth by initial firm&#13;
             size, with the black bars reflecting firms that remained in the same size category (in terms of&#13;
             employment). The dynamic picture of firm growth indicates that the probability of shrinking in&#13;
             size has been significantly higher for smaller firms than for larger ones, with very few firms&#13;
             graduating to the higher employment size section of the chart.&#13;

3.21     The results on net job creation have had implications on the size of formal sector&#13;
establishments in the Kyrgyz Republic. With strong rates of entry coming from relatively smaller&#13;
establishments (relative to the existing composition of jobs), and significant job shedding by larger&#13;
established firms, the size of the formal sector is shrinking. Between 2009 and 2012, the number&#13;
of firms increased by almost 4.5 percent a year over the period, with no employment creation&#13;
beyond (small) entrants. The result has been a decline in the average employment of formal sector&#13;
companies, from about 18 employees per establishment to about 16.&#13;

&#13;
3.22     An aggregate accounting of jobs by large versus small established firms suggests&#13;
small and medium firms have neither created jobs nor grown, while large established firms&#13;
grew but did not create employment. Figure 3.1 decomposes the dynamics of small and medium&#13;
sized firm and large firm growth in terms of value added and employment. Over the 2009-2012&#13;
period, small and medium sized firms lost much more in output than they did in employment, (for&#13;
small firms primarily because the workforce was already small, and reduction in employment&#13;
would be akin to exiting). Large firms on the other hand have demonstrated strong output growth&#13;
in the midst of job shedding.&#13;

3.23     Significantly higher regulatory requirements and payments make growth beyond&#13;
smallness cost-ineffective. Many sources point to a regulatory environment which particularly&#13;
discourages the growth of small and medium firms. Based on a range of business and regulatory&#13;
costs (financial and other), Investment Climate Assessments suggest that medium sized firms face&#13;
the largest regulatory burden among firm size types. As a result, the incentives to remain small&#13;
(and revert to smallness) are large (see Figure 3.12). Among the challenges for firm-size expansion&#13;
are the complex and burdensome regulatory environment, especially in tax administration,&#13;
corruption, and political stability. The Kyrgyz Republic has a special tax regime, including the&#13;
patent system, which incentives small-sized firms to stay small instead of scaling up and expanding&#13;
beyond the tax incentive threshold. Another way around these regulatory burdens is through&#13;
underreporting employment (to social security) and sales (to tax authorities), and it is common&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       39&#13;
&amp;#12;across countries that smaller firms underreport more than larger firms. Thus, small firms may be&#13;
growing, but underreporting their growth&#13;
&#13;
3.24     Alternatively, small firms may be circumventing some of these regulations and&#13;
procedures by hiring contract workers, who would not encounter the same labor and other&#13;
requirements as employees. The KER data indicates use of contract labor peaks for smaller to&#13;
small-medium firms, and reduces to no use of contract workers for firms with more than 50&#13;
employees (Figure 3.13). Because employment size is determined based on all categories of labor&#13;
(including contract workers), firms in the category of 11-15 workers, for example, can include firms&#13;
with 10 employees, with supplementary employment from contractors. This would be consistent&#13;
with the low job creation rates among growing small establishments.&#13;

3.25     While large firms have a low elasticity of employment to growth, growing firms have&#13;
expanded employment. While employment elasticities are low, there is a fairly close association&#13;
between economic growth and hiring. Firms that have grown (in real output) have in general&#13;
expanded employment (Figure 3.14). On average, expanding establishments (in terms of value&#13;
added) have seen employment grow by about 13 percent a year (5 percent a year excluding&#13;
entrants). This compares with job losses averaging 14 percent a year among establishments which&#13;
experienced negative value added growth (and job growth of about 2 percent a year among non-&#13;
profit establishments).&#13;
&#13;
3.26    â&#128;¦but growth is concentrated in a few firms which donâ&#128;&#153;t create jobs. A very small&#13;
number of firms are responsible for a large portion of overall output, and these establishments on&#13;
average have very low employment creation rates. Little more than forty firms account for half of&#13;
the output growth generated by growing establishments over the 2009-2012 period, and while they&#13;
did expand employment (by around 17 percent in aggregate), job growth paled in comparison to&#13;
output growth, which expanded 10 fold.&#13;

3.27     Part of the low employment elasticity of large firms reflects a rebound in growth in&#13;
loss-making establishments. Many of Kyrgyzâ&#128;&#153;s large establishments were in significant loss-&#13;
making positions in 2009, and their financial turnaround contributed much to the overall growth&#13;
that as exhibited by large establishments, in aggregate (Figure 3.15). However, there was little job&#13;
creation associated with this turnaround. This is potentially because there was limited labor&#13;
shedding with the economic downturn (and thus limited adjustment with the upswing). Large firms&#13;
have greater capacity to weather economic storms, and the necessity for adjusting workers on the&#13;
margin may be significantly lower.&#13;
&#13;
3.28    â&#128;¦but in general, large firms grow with limited labor adjustment. As a group, large&#13;
value-producing firms (i.e., excluding non-profits) experienced value added growth averaging 9&#13;
percent a year, while shedding labor at a rate of about 6 percent a year.&#13;
&#13;
3.29     Several features suggest the bulk of these large growing firms face limited competitive&#13;
pressure. A closer examination of the large established firms that have contributed the most to&#13;
value added17 (compared with other large establishments and other non-large value-producing&#13;
establishments) provides evidence of limited competitive pressures, significant market power,&#13;
strong economies of scale which allow for growth without job creation, and access to resources that&#13;
are not shared by even other large firms (Figure 3.16).&#13;

3.30     The large establishments which have overwhelmingly contributed to growth (but not&#13;
employment) over the period have significantly higher average market share, even compared&#13;
with other large establishments. They have about twice the access to bank lending as other large&#13;
establishments (and more than 10 times the access to bank lending as non-large companies). While&#13;
the access to budget loans (government lending) among establishments is low in general, about 3&#13;
percent of the largest growing firms have access to budgetary credit â&#128;&#147; 5 times the rate of other large&#13;
firms and 30 times the rate of non-large firms. The composition of growth, in terms of tradeables&#13;
to non-tradeables, is not significantly different between the largest growing establishments and&#13;
other establishments (with about 35 percent of value added growth coming from tradeables), but a&#13;
matching of the product groups to UN Comtrade data on imports suggests that a very low proportion&#13;
of the tradeables production is imported in the largest growing establishments18, suggesting a level&#13;
of implicit or explicit protection. In some sectors, the geography itself may create import&#13;
protection, with significantly higher freight costs impeding greater imports. Of the top growing&#13;
large mining and manufacturing establishments, more than 30 percent of value added growth came&#13;
from heavy goods, such as concrete, bricks, and motor vehicle parts. In the same manner that the&#13;
Kyrgyz geography creates disadvantages for exports, it likewise creates similar disadvantages for&#13;
cost-effective imports, creating natural levels of protection for domestic producers.&#13;
&#13;
3.31    These companies also demonstrate stronger economies of scale. A production process&#13;
exhibits economies of scale when the marginal return from a unit of input exceeds the average&#13;
returns. While we are only able to assess the average returns, we can compare the initial ratio of&#13;
output/inputs to the growth of output/inputs over the period. Thus, we compute an economies of&#13;
scale index calculated as the share of the growth of outputs to the growth of inputs over the share&#13;
of the original output to the original inputs. The inputs used for the calculation represent the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18&#13;
   The correspondence between import data and the production data is hardly exact, but a rough&#13;
correspondence using SITC revision 2 product classifications at the 4 digit level to NACE codes suggests&#13;
under any circumstance significantly greater import value to production among non-large or large but not&#13;
high growth establishments.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
3.32     Overall, the core jobs challenge in the formal sector is a growth challenge. For small&#13;
and medium sized firms, while rates of entry are high, there are constraints to survival and growth&#13;
which prevent establishments from growing to create sustainable employment. There are also&#13;
constraints to job creation, even accounting for growth, which may suggest additional incentives to&#13;
remain small for regulatory reasons. Even among growing small and medium firms (except for the&#13;
very small), net job creation was negative over the period. For large firms, the growth problem is&#13;
not related to the size of growth but the pattern of growth. Very large firms account for most of&#13;
the growth in value added among formal establishments, and increased market power has allowed&#13;
them to increase earnings without an expansion in costs (including labor).&#13;
&#13;
    D. IMPLICATIONS OF THE JOBS AND GROWTH DYNAMICS IN THE FORMAL&#13;
       SECTOR&#13;
&#13;
Productivity growth has been captured by a few firms, with limited spillovers and&#13;
employment growth&#13;
&#13;
3.33    Strong productivity growth in the formal sector points to declining productivity in&#13;
the informal sector. At the aggregate level, with strong overall growth and job shedding,&#13;
aggregate productivity growth in the formal sector has been strong, averaging 6.7 percent a year&#13;
for value-creating firms. National accounts data suggests that economy wide, productivity growth&#13;
averaged less than 1 percent a year, which would hint at significant productivity declines in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     43&#13;
&amp;#12;informal sector (Figure 3.17). National accounts also points to productivity declines in both&#13;
manufacturing and construction, but the KER data suggests that productivity growth has been&#13;
strongly positive in the formal industrial sector, save utilities. Indeed, productivity growth in&#13;
manufacturing and construction (which had the highest productivity declines at the national level)&#13;
have been positive and even exceeded productivity growth in formal services. With the formal&#13;
sector accounting for only 25 percent of manufacturing employment and 10 percent of construction&#13;
employment, the productivity dynamics identified at the macroeconomic level may suggest that&#13;
rising informality is significantly impacting overall productivity in the sector.&#13;

3.34     Productivity growth in formal enterprises has been strong, but it is concentrated&#13;
among large firms. Overall productivity per worker rose in value producing firms by around 6.7&#13;
percent a year (from about $3,200 per worker to $3,931) (Figure 3.18 and Figure 3.19). Large&#13;
established enterprises and large entrants together contributed more than 145 percent to the&#13;
increase, but established firms which were not large dragged productivity growth down. Outside&#13;
of large entrants, other entrants contributed only a small portion to productivity growth, though&#13;
they accounted for almost all of the entrants. The productivity decomposition is further evidence&#13;
of the very strong role that large firms play in overall growth and productivity outcomes in the&#13;
Kyrgyz formal sector. Moving beyond large firms, however, productivity growth has been&#13;
negative, with output per worker declining from around 213 thousand som to 164 thousand som&#13;
(or a decline of about 9 percent a year).&#13;
&#13;
3.35    The lack of productivity growth outside large firms limits technological spillovers.&#13;
There is substantial evidence that sustained growth happens in when less-productive firms adopt&#13;
technology and business practices of frontier firms. As a result, as countries develop, productivity&#13;
per worker differences between firms in an industry decline. The concentration of productivity in&#13;
the Kyrgyz Republic suggests a lack of technological spillovers from large established firms to&#13;
entrants/small firms, which has implications for long run growth. Sustained growth involves new&#13;

&amp;#12;and smaller firms capturing the spillover of technological and management knowledge from&#13;
frontier firms. Without that spillover, growth becomes an enclave activity, benefitting few.&#13;

3.36     Labor reallocation to more productive activities has taken place, primarily the result&#13;
of labor shedding from less productive firms (rather than growth of new productive&#13;
establishments) One of the key indicators of better jobs is productivity growth, which can come&#13;
from productivity growth within firms/industries/locations, or movement of labor to more&#13;
productive firms/industries/locations. Over the 2009 to 2012 period, employment has shifted from&#13;
less productive firms to more productive firms. The shift is less a reflection of employment creation&#13;
in productive establishments than by labor shedding in less productive establishments. Ranking&#13;
establishments by their average productivity (real value added per worker), it is possible to see how&#13;
overall employment has grown among establishments by their productivity levels in 2009 versus&#13;
2012. From that, there has been marginal growth in employment among the top two quintiles, and&#13;
a shrinking of employment at the lower end of the productivity spectrum (Figure 3.21).&#13;
&#13;
3.37    The concentration of both growth and productivity growth has meant that&#13;
employment has not been pulled. Strong output growth has resulted in productivity growth&#13;
primarily carried by large firms, which has resulted in limited relationship between productivity&#13;
gains and employment creation. Economy wide, output growth of 6.6 percent a year was&#13;
accompanied by job growth -0.1 percent a year, resulting in productivity growth of 6.7 percent a&#13;
year. The same phenomenon of growth without jobs is true across sectors, and only a few sectors&#13;
have actually created employment (while almost all sectors have demonstrated strong productivity&#13;
growth) (Figure 3.20).&#13;

Wage growth does not relate strongly to productivity growth&#13;

3.38    â&#128;¦nor have wages been pulled. In 58 percent of establishments which demonstrated&#13;
productivity growth there was accompanying wage growth â&#128;&#147; the corollary of which is that in 42&#13;
percent of productivity growing establishments, average wages did not increase despite&#13;
productivity. The employment weighted results are broadly similar. At the sectoral level, while&#13;
there appears to be some relationship between wages and productivity, the relationship if far from&#13;
consistent (Figure 3.22).&#13;

3.39    Wages and productivity growth are particularly out of alignment for public&#13;
enterprises. Although the KER data does not include public administration employment, it does&#13;
include state-owned enterprises (and further allows for distinguishing between revenue-generating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 46&#13;
&amp;#12;establishments and non-revenue-generating organizations). From that, there is evidence of&#13;
significant differences in wage growth between the public and private sector. Over the 2009-2012&#13;
period, the average level of labor compensation increased by less than a percent a year in revenue-&#13;
generating establishments, compared with more than 5 percent a year in non-revenue generating&#13;
establishments. A similar picture emerges when looking at compensation by the ownership&#13;
structure of firms, where state-owned enterprises saw compensation levels increase by about 3.3&#13;
percent over the 2009-2012 period, compared with less than 2 percent in private establishments.&#13;
Overall, the KER data suggests that the average compensation in state-owned, non-profit&#13;
establishments increased by 6 percent a year compared with about 1 percent a year growth in&#13;
private, revenue generating establishments (see Figure 3.23)19.&#13;

Low rates of growth or firm entry in some sectors have weakened job creation&#13;
3.40     Export-oriented manufacturing is particularly impeded from stronger growth. Export&#13;
oriented manufacturing, which has a strong job-creation capacity has significantly lower rates of&#13;
entry than other sectors. While some of the growth and hiring differences among firms is the result&#13;
of factors highlighted earlier â&#128;&#147; the age of the establishment, its size, its ownership, its level of&#13;
investment, and the like, a part is also directly related to the activities undertaken. Some sectors&#13;
display much higher rates of labor adjustment (hiring) in the presence of growth, beyond what can&#13;
be attributed to size/age differences. And some activities simply have higher growth potential.&#13;
Understanding these differences provides a better understanding of the landscape for job creation&#13;
in the formal sector. To disentangle the effects, Table 3.5 presents the differences in sectoral hiring&#13;
rates (relative to the sample mean), broken down between the portion attributable to higher&#13;

   Based on establishment reports samples (which do not include public administration, nor do they include&#13;
a large portion of public employment in education and health). Wage information from household data does&#13;
not permit identification of ownership structure of the place of employment, nor whether the establishment&#13;
is revenue-generating.&#13;

     3.41     Agriculture stands out in terms of hiring, driven equally between higher probability&#13;
     of growth and greater hiring inclination, given growth. A large number of new farming&#13;
     activities began operation over the period, which, combined with strong expansion of several&#13;
     existing establishments, resulted in a large number of establishments exhibiting growth over the&#13;
     period. But about half of the stronger hiring rates is attributable to higher probability of hiring,&#13;
     given growth. On average, agriculture establishments are 15 percent more likely to hire than&#13;
     establishments in other sectors, given growth.&#13;
&#13;
     3.42     The hiring probability attached to growth is a slightly different issue from the&#13;
     employment creation capacity of growth. The stronger hiring rates in agriculture, relative to&#13;
     other growing sectors, relates to its inclination to adjust labor on the margin â&#128;&#147; regardless of what&#13;
     the level of growth is. The agriculture sector exhibits a much stronger relationship between the&#13;
     presence of growth and the inclination to expand employment. It may relate to a greater flexibility&#13;
     in hiring and firing workers (and thus easier adjustment), or it may relate to the lower direct labor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     20&#13;
       Although the dependent variable is binary and OLS will not produce the best linear unbiased estimator,&#13;
     regression analysis was used for easier interpretation of marginal effects (see Beck, 2011 for discussion of&#13;

&amp;#12;adjustment costs associated with the sector. The average compensation in these jobs is significantly&#13;
lower: even in the formal sector, the average compensation in agriculture is only about a third of&#13;
the average level of compensation in the formal sector, overall.&#13;
&#13;
3.43     Despite being capital intensive, mining also exhibits higher than average propensity&#13;
to hire, given positive growth. About half of all mining establishments expanded employment&#13;
over the period, relative to about 41 percent economy wide. With a large number of entrants to&#13;
the sector (29 percent), growth accounted for much of the increased hiring rates in the sector, but&#13;
not all. On average, mining establishments were 5 percent more likely to expand employment than&#13;
other sectors, given the presence of growth. Mining is not traditionally seen as a labor-intensive&#13;
sector, so it may be all the more surprising that the sector has demonstrated a more robust&#13;
growth/hiring relationship than other sectors.&#13;
&#13;
3.44     Underlying these differences in hiring are large differences in growth related to firm&#13;
entry. While sectors may have similar probabilities for growth (similar proportions of growing&#13;
firms), entrants by definition must create employment to grow. Thus, it is not surprising that the&#13;
highest rates of hiring (given growth) occur in the sectors where entrants make up a large portion&#13;
of the â&#128;&#156;growersâ&#128;&#157;. Sectors like manufacturing, utilities and finance all exhibited very low rates of&#13;
entry, while education and agriculture have had very high rates of entry into the sector (Figure&#13;
3.24). Indeed, sectoral growth is largely related to the degree to which establishments can enter&#13;
the market. Taking into account this difference, Annex table A.5 outlines the sectoral differences&#13;
in hiring over the period by entrants versus established firms.&#13;

3.45     Manufacturing jobs reflect the most net jobs â&#128;&#156;lostâ&#128;&#157; to low levels of firm entry. What&#13;
would net job creation look like with higher rates of firm entry? At the economy wide level, the&#13;
rate of entry of establishments is about 22 percent. To get a rough estimate of the jobs and value&#13;
impacts of increasing that rate to 30 percent (holding survival rates constant), we modeled at the&#13;
sector level the increase in firms that would imply for each sector, and used the average number of&#13;
jobs created by entrants in the sector (over the 2009-2012 period) and the average VA per worker&#13;
for entrants to obtain sector-specific jobs impacts (Table 3.6). For sectors like agriculture, which&#13;
are already more open than that level (rate of entry 32 percent), we imposed no changes. For sectors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  49&#13;
&amp;#12;with very low rates of entry, like manufacturing, utilities and finance, this would imply very large&#13;
changes in the rates of entry (the number of new firms, however, would also depend on the current&#13;
number of establishments). But entering firms have different capacities to create jobs and value,&#13;
depending upon the economic activity. Entrants in manufacturing, for example, on average create&#13;
29 jobs, where in utilities, the number is only 9 jobs (and in finance only 7). If new entrants on&#13;
average created the same number of jobs and average value added as in the past 4 years, it is clear&#13;
that the bulk of job creation and value creation from increased entry would come from&#13;
manufacturing, not only because it is a large sector, but because its current rates of entry are well&#13;
below average (13.5 percent versus 22 percent economy-wide).&#13;

&#13;
3.46    The overall picture of the formal sector is one of lack of the kind of dynamism that&#13;
creates jobs. Although there has been growth, it has been severely concentrated among a few large&#13;
conglomerates that face limited competition and exhibit and growth without jobs. Small and&#13;
medium sized firms demonstrate low rates of survival, as well as lower growth and low levels of&#13;
job creation. Firm entry, while relatively high at the aggregate level, is low in the sectors that create&#13;
most jobs (including manufacturing).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   50&#13;
&amp;#12;3.47    Within this broad picture of the formal sector, there are a few dynamic sectors, but&#13;
they account for very small shares of overall employment (even among the value-creating&#13;
firms), and are reliant upon the continuing inflow of remittances to fuel domestic demand.&#13;
Few are in export oriented industries. Among the top quintile of establishments with regard to job&#13;
growth in which value added growth was positive21, only about 15 percent of the value added came&#13;
from tradeables goods (whether traded or not). Most of the job-generating establishments (even&#13;
ones that grow) are dominated by the services sector. While that growth has been dynamic in the&#13;
presence of strong remittance flows, it is less resistant to a sudden stop or drop in remittance flows.&#13;
&#13;
3.48     Surveys of establishments suggest a variety of obstacles to the survival and growth of&#13;
small and medium sized businesses. Low rates of survival and low growth among smaller&#13;
establishments are indicative of both a lack of technological spillovers from large establishments&#13;
and impediments to doing business. Surveys of establishments suggest a variety of potential&#13;
barriers to doing business, from burdensome regulations in product markets, in the form of&#13;
procedures for starting a business, registering property, and dealing with construction permits, as&#13;
well as difficulties in the credit market (such as availability and affordability of financial services),&#13;
and difficulties with contract enforcement. While medium sized establishments complain they face&#13;
the largest costs of business, global comparisons of the processes for doing business in Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic suggest a business environment that is challenging for most firms. The Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
ranks far from the frontier of good practice relative across a broad range of areas, and over the past&#13;
four years, it has not made progress on improving their distance to the frontier (and indeed have&#13;
lost distance on several areas).&#13;
&#13;
3.49     There is also evidence to suggest large firms face significantly less competitive&#13;
pressures and have substantially greater access to operational buffers that aid in survival.&#13;
The largest growing firms, responsible for half of the growth exhibited in the formal sector, are&#13;
significantly more protected from market competition either domestically or through imports.&#13;
Moreover, they are greater access to both bank finance and budgetary finance, allowing them to&#13;
better weather downturns and maintain operations.&#13;
&#13;
3.50     Hiring differences among firms also relate to differences at the sectoral level in firm&#13;
entry, and the employment creation capacity of different activities. While firm size plays a&#13;
large roll in growth, sectoral growth is heavily determined by firm entry, with new firms by&#13;
definition in periods of expansion. Some sectors, like manufacturing, demonstrate much greater&#13;
capacity to create jobs, when they are expanding, but the levels of firm entry are relatively low.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21&#13;
   There are a sizeable amount of establishments which demonstrated job growth in the face of value added&#13;
declines, but we consider only establishments that are growing, which is likely the more sustainable source&#13;
of job growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;           CHAPTER 4. ASSESSING JOBS CHALLENGES AND&#13;
                LEARNING FROM COMPARATORS&#13;
&#13;
4.1     The most visible evidence of constraints to better jobs in the Kyrgyz Republic has&#13;
been the migration of workers themselves. And it has also been the most effective in relieving&#13;
these constraints. The current model has worked well from the point of view of individuals. It has&#13;
provided jobs where there have been jobs deficits, particularly for young male workers. It has&#13;
provided substantially higher wages. It has brought greater incomes to economically&#13;
disenfranchised sections of the country. It has created the possibility of self-employment&#13;
domestically through the flow of worker remittances boosting consumer demand.&#13;
&#13;
4.2      One of the fundamental jobs dilemmas for the Kyrgyz Republic relates not to the jobs&#13;
outcomes experienced in the past decade, but to the sustainability of its development model&#13;
for the future. Based on any reasonable projections of employment growth, migration will&#13;
continue to play an important role in Kyrgyzstanâ&#128;&#153;s employment solutions for the next decade, at a&#13;
minimum. But the reliance on the current model for employment carries with it risks, which if not&#13;
effectively managed, can undermine the ability to create good jobs going forward. Many of these&#13;
risks may have already materialized and may be constraints to better jobs outcomes today. One of&#13;
the symptoms of the non-sustainability of the current development model could be seen for instance&#13;
in the stagnation in poverty reduction observed since 2009. In this respect, recent analyses22 on the&#13;
drivers of economic mobility suggest a significant link between poverty persistence and different&#13;
types of jobs in terms of quality of occupation as well as specific sectors of employment (see Box&#13;
4-1 below for further details).&#13;
&#13;
       ï&#130;·    First, there is the challenge of Dutch Disease. These are the difficulties that relate not to&#13;
            the migration experience, but to the impacts of remittance flows into the country, in&#13;
            particular to the reduced competitiveness of the manufacturing sector.&#13;
       ï&#130;·    Second, there is the challenge of a disabling business environment. They relate to low&#13;
            and concentrated levels of growth and job creation in the business sector. They involve&#13;
            constraints to business entry, survival, growth and innovation, and beyond what is&#13;
            suggested in Enterprise Surveys and Doing Business are evidenced by the lack of foreign&#13;
            direct investment and business entry, survival, and expansion.&#13;
       ï&#130;·    Third, there is the challenge of geography. These are the challenges to growth and jobs&#13;
            opportunities, given location and terrain. These are challenges exacerbated by the Dutch&#13;
            Disease.&#13;
       ï&#130;·    Fourth there is the challenge of migrationâ&#128;&#153;s effects on labor markets. It relates to the set&#13;
            of challenges created by workers physically moving abroad or inter-regionally, and&#13;
            involves the impacts of these movements both for workers themselves and for longer-term&#13;
            growth and job creation.&#13;
       ï&#130;·    Finally, there is the challenge of the â&#128;&#152;migration trapâ&#128;&#153;. Separate from concerns about the&#13;
            business and regulatory environment in which firms operate, there is the additional&#13;
            challenge of migrationâ&#128;&#153;s success to date, which lowers the urgency for addressing all of&#13;
            the constraints to strong and sustained domestic job creation.&#13;

&amp;#12;             Box 4-1: Poverty dynamics and the role of jobs in the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
 After a decade of uninterrupted achievements in poverty reduction, starting from 2009 poverty eradication started&#13;
 to stagnate in a context of still sustained but rather unstable growth in the total economy.&#13;
 In the attempt to shed some light on what has happened and why, an analysis of economic mobility was carried out&#13;
 resorting to a â&#128;&#156;trulyâ&#128;&#157; panel data set: the â&#128;&#152;Life in Kyrgyzstan Surveyâ&#128;&#153; made available from the DIW in Berlin.&#13;
 Mobility analysis can indeed help to unveil what happened below the surface of poverty stagnation by highlighting&#13;
 who did transition in and out of poverty over time, as well as who persisted into the poverty status, also suggesting&#13;
 some of the key determinants of the movements observed.&#13;
 Among other things this study was particularly interested in investigating the role eventually played by jobs and&#13;
 labor market outcomes in moving people (or preventing them from moving) out of poverty. In this respect, results&#13;
 have shown that (see Chart 1 below):&#13;
         -   Being employed (as opposed to be either unemployed or inactive) as well as increasing the employment&#13;
             rate of the members of a household does not seem to influence neither the probability to leave poverty&#13;
             nor that of being stuck into it over time. However:&#13;
         -   Systematic differences appear instead to emerge with respect to specific sectors of employment as well&#13;
             as the specific types â&#128;&#147; in terms of intrinsic quality - of occupation.&#13;
         -   The evidence suggests indeed that working in the mining and agricultural sectors enhances the&#13;
             probability of persisting in poverty.&#13;
         -   At the same time, being employed in a high quality type of occupation, which usually requires a&#13;
             relatively higher level of education, significantly increases the chance of leaving the poverty status over&#13;
             time.&#13;
         -   Education was indeed confirmed as one of the key drivers of economic mobility in the country.&#13;

4.3     The Kyrgyz Republic faces several ongoing challenges to improving jobs outcomes&#13;
and creating dynamic sources of good jobs domestically. Some of these challenges cannot be&#13;
â&#128;&#156;fixedâ&#128;&#157; quickly. Rather, they relate to country conditions and require consistent efforts on multiple&#13;
fronts. Comparator countries â&#128;&#147; countries with similar country conditions â&#128;&#147; can provide lessons for&#13;
overcoming these challenges to better employment:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                       53&#13;
&amp;#12;     A.   DUTCH DISEASE&#13;
&#13;
4.4      Just as a natural resource dependent economy can experience negative impacts from&#13;
the windfall revenues from natural resource extraction, a migration-reliant country can&#13;
experience many of the same symptoms of â&#128;&#156;Dutch Disease.â&#128;&#157; The original phenomenon reflects&#13;
the experience of the Netherlands after the discovery of natural gas exports, where large windfall&#13;
gains increased domestic demand, raised the price of non-tradable goods leading to an appreciation&#13;
of the Dutch currency, and ultimately led to a fall in exports and employment in trade-oriented&#13;
sectors.&#13;
&#13;
4.5      The fundamentals are similar for emigration-prone economies. The inflow of&#13;
remittances leads to an increase in the supply of foreign exchange in the domestic currency market&#13;
and causes the domestic currency to appreciate. This appreciation draws resources out of the traded&#13;
goods sector through upward pressure on wages. Higher non-tradable prices lead to higher wages&#13;
in that sector, causing an expansion of the non-tradable sector. The increase in production costs&#13;
leads to a contraction in the tradable sector, making exports substantially less competitive. Oomes&#13;
and Kalcheva23 offered four main symptoms of Dutch Disease: (1) real appreciation; (2) a&#13;
slowdown in manufacturing growth; (3) an acceleration in service sector growth; and, (4) an&#13;
increase in the overall wage level.&#13;
&#13;
4.6     As demonstrated in Chapter 2, all four of these symptoms have been present in the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic to some degree. It is possible that several of these symptoms, including the&#13;
slowdown in manufacturing growth and the boom in service sector growth, are transition effects&#13;
and not related to remittances,24 and thus the strict categorization of the cause being Dutch Disease&#13;
cannot be authenticated. However, the macroeconomic management of remittance flows remains&#13;
important for long term sustainability of jobs and wage growth. The main risk of Dutch Disease,&#13;
from the standpoint of jobs, is the greater difficulty of creating jobs in tradeables (manufacturing&#13;
and agriculture, but also tradable services), because of declining competitiveness. On the other&#13;
hand, and as already evidenced in the Kyrgyz Republic, the wealth effect of the remittance boom&#13;
has helped the development of non-tradable service sector.&#13;
&#13;
4.7      Then the question becomes: why is Dutch Disease of concern if jobs can continue to&#13;
be created in a booming services sector? There are at least three reasons why this is a concern.&#13;
First, there is the issue of the vulnerability of the service sector growth model, not only to migration&#13;
policy abroad, but also to migrant jobs prospects and remittance behavior. Unlike commodity&#13;
booms, which are under the control of affected resource-receiving countries, migration is both a&#13;
private decision and governed in part by economic conditions and political arrangements abroad.&#13;
The recent collapse of the ruble at the end of 2014 and start of mass exodus of migrants, including&#13;
from the Kyrgyz Republic, is testimony to the risks involved with migration-led jobs. While&#13;
remittances tend to be countercyclical to home country conditions (people sending more when&#13;
conditions are poor), they are also very cyclical to host country conditions. Moreover the impact&#13;
of return on labor markets is compounded: not only does a returned migrant require an additional&#13;
job from the domestic labor market, the remittances that have been funding the service sector&#13;
growth (and jobs) have been reduced.&#13;
&#13;
4.8     Second, there is the issue of the quality of the jobs that can be created in the services&#13;
sector. The Kyrgyz data confirms that manufacturing sector jobs are more productive and pay&#13;
higher wages than the services sector. Even controlling for the level of education of the worker,&#13;
&#13;
23&#13;

                                                  54&#13;
&amp;#12;the average labor income of workers is higher in manufacturing than in all other sectors but mining.&#13;
On average, workers in manufacturing can expect to earn a premium ranging from only 2 percent&#13;
over jobs in construction to almost 20 percent in real estate and business services: this despite the&#13;
fact that manufacturing sector itself has become highly informal and the premium has reduced.&#13;
&#13;
4.9     Thirdly, manufacturing is the source of innovation. Based on the experience of other&#13;
countries, manufacturing firms are more likely to introduce new products or new business&#13;
processes25. More importantly, the innovation that takes place in manufacturing leads to&#13;
productivity improvements that spill over into agriculture and services. Thus, maintaining and&#13;
growing a manufacturing base is important for sustaining more productive jobs in all sectors.&#13;
&#13;
4.10    What can be learned from other migration prone countries? Migration prone countries&#13;
face particular challenges with Dutch Disease. Traditional resource-based countries suffering from&#13;
Dutch Disease have managed to contain the exchange rate appreciation of natural resource revenue&#13;
windfalls by paying down foreign debt or establishing a wealth fund that can be invested abroad.&#13;
By investing resource revenues in foreign assets, they are able to avoid huge increases in public&#13;
spending and the inflow of foreign exchange. Migration prone countries however have the&#13;
additional challenge of the windfall wealth being private.&#13;
&#13;
4.11    Migration prone countries have adopted various policies to offset the effects of&#13;
remittance flows on the equilibrium real exchange rate, or compensate the economyâ&#128;&#153;s traded&#13;
goods sector for the loss of competitiveness that it suffers from real exchange rate&#13;
appreciation. If remittances could be invested in the export sector, for example, the resulting&#13;
increase in productivity and drop in costs for the sector could help to compensate for the effects of&#13;
Dutch Disease. Maintaining a flexible exchange rate policy can also help to counterbalance&#13;
negative impacts from shocks and maintain competitiveness.&#13;
&#13;
4.12     Improving the development impact of remittances can also be fostered through&#13;
strengthened financial intermediation of remittances. Improving the ability of the economy to&#13;
mobilize savings and direct savings to high-return projects, to improve the access of formal&#13;
remittance recipients to other financial products (thereby reducing risks), and to enable policy&#13;
makers to monitor and react more effectively to changes in remittance flows are effective ways to&#13;
facilitate job-creating investments and poverty reduction. These are the examples that can be&#13;
explored as part of the Kyrgyz Republicâ&#128;&#153;s jobs policy agenda, particularly as migration is likely to&#13;
be a phenomenon with which it must contend over the medium to long term.&#13;
&#13;
     B.   BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
&#13;
4.13     The business environment is not a constraint but an outcome of a variety of&#13;
constraints. The prior highlighted some core constraints to job creation in the formal business&#13;
sector related to overall low levels of employment creation given growth, and particularly for small&#13;
and medium sized firms (but also for some large firms) challenges with entry, survival and growth.&#13;
The evidence points to a lack of competitive pressures for a number of very large establishments,&#13;
which grow but do not expand employment, balanced with small and medium firms that create jobs&#13;
as they enter but do not expand further (or exit).&#13;
&#13;
4.14    Understanding the core constraints to growth in the formal sector requires a fuller&#13;
assessment of the regulatory and structural impediments among establishments. The&#13;
Enterprise Surveys can be useful in pointing to some of the problems most often mentioned, and&#13;
&#13;
25&#13;
     Helper, Krueger, and Wial. 2012.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 55&#13;
&amp;#12;some of these top complaints have been highlighted in, particularly with a view to understanding&#13;
difficulties with growing to medium sized or surviving. However, what the firm analysis can point&#13;
to problems with growth, survival, technology spillovers and lack of competitive pressures among&#13;
large established firms. It cannot tell us why.&#13;
&#13;
4.15    One area that is very high on the list of complaints of established firms, small or large&#13;
(but particularly small and medium) is the widespread perception of corruption. The Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic ranks high on a number of corruption indicators, including graft, bribes in paying taxes,&#13;
and bribes in getting licenses or permits (Figure 4.1,Figure 4.2, and Figure 4.3). The Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic ranks significantly higher than other ECA developing countries, and even higher than the&#13;
average of low income countries.&#13;

4.16     The issue of corruption, from a jobs standpoint, is important for the potential&#13;
implications on public sector hiring and wages. An area of some discussion is the level of wages&#13;
of public servants. The Public Expenditure Review for the Kyrgyz Republic suggests the wage bill&#13;
as a share of GDP is in line with ECA norms, but there are many sources which suggest that public&#13;
sector wages in the Kyrgyz Republic are problematically low, creating increased incentives for&#13;
corruption. As noted by Bekbolotov (2007):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      56&#13;
&amp;#12;                 â&#128;&#156;Unrealistically low wages in the public sector invite corruption. There are&#13;
                 widespread perceptions that government officials, who had to more or less purchase&#13;
                 their positions, then work to recoup their investments by taking bribes â&#128;¦.The&#13;
                 unofficial income generated as a result of abuse of their position remains the major&#13;
                 incentive for people to work for the government26â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
4.17    An additional issue particularly for the Kyrgyz Republicâ&#128;&#153;s business environment&#13;
concerns the informal sector. The informal sector (accounting for 70 percent of employment) has&#13;
the potential to impact the formal sector competitiveness (and indeed one of the biggest business&#13;
complaints concerns competition from the informal sector), but it is a large employment sector in&#13;
its own right, and improving productivity and incomes within the informal sector must be&#13;
considered an important aspect of the jobs agenda.&#13;
&#13;
4.18    The jobs agenda for the informal sector depends in large part on how it links to the&#13;
formal sector. Because the formal sector employs a significantly smaller share of the domestic&#13;
labor force (and a significantly smaller share of the poor), understanding the relationship between&#13;
formal, informal and farm employment is important for prioritization of jobs strategies, including&#13;
for shared prosperity. From Section 2, it is evident that formal sector jobs in the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
are more productive, better paying jobs, but they also employ a significantly smaller share the labor&#13;
force including the poor and vulnerable. Creating policies for jobs for the poor, in particular, must&#13;
involve job and productivity growth that can most effectively and sustainably benefit the bottom&#13;
40 percent of the population. Shared prosperity through jobs could be achieved through relatively&#13;
strong growth in formal sector jobs that can benefit the poor (either within the formal sector or&#13;
through strong links to the informal sector), or through a rise in productivity in the informal&#13;
economy.&#13;
&#13;
4.19    Appropriate policies for poverty reduction in the Kyrgyz Republic through jobs will&#13;
depend in large part on the evidence about the nature of the informal sector and how it relates&#13;
to the overall economy. Ultimately, raising incomes for the majority of workers (and particularly&#13;
the poor) requires increasing productivity of workers. But raising productivity in the informal&#13;
sector requires both an understanding of the nature of informality, but also how activities in the&#13;
formal sector spillover to informal activities and jobs. Without informal sector surveys, a&#13;
comprehensive understanding of productivity impediments cannot be undertaken. However, it is&#13;
nonetheless useful to understand how the informal economy relates to the formal sector, as it&#13;
provides a better sense of the strategy for reaching the poor.&#13;
&#13;
4.20     The policies for improving jobs will differ depending on the nature of the informal&#13;
sector. If the informal sector is predominantly composed of entrepreneurs escaping the high costs&#13;
of formality, improving the conditions of employment implies lowering the costs and raising the&#13;
benefits of formality (such as through reducing taxes including social security contributions, right-&#13;
sizing labor regulation, improving the business regulatory environment, and increasing sanctions&#13;
for non-compliance). In that way, dynamic entrepreneurs are able to better access finance and&#13;
capital which are less available in the informal activities, and thereby grow and expand&#13;
employment. If however, the informal sector is composed primarily of refuge unemployment â&#128;&#147;&#13;
workers unable to obtain formal sector employment, either because of low demand, or because they&#13;
are inherently different from workers in formal establishments (and in some sense have structural&#13;
â&#128;&#152;employabilityâ&#128;&#153; challenges), then improving the conditions of informal workers might more&#13;
appropriately focus on poverty reduction measures (and alternatively, on improving the conditions&#13;
under which these lower productivity activities can flourish). Because the informal sector more&#13;
&#13;
26&#13;
     Bekbolotov, 2007.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  57&#13;
&amp;#12;       reasonably represents a mix of informal activities, with some held back from formalization by&#13;
       excessive regulatory costs, while others comprise subsistence employment, then the strategies for&#13;
       better jobs will need to focus on both separately.&#13;
&#13;
       4.21    Each theory of informality will imply a different relationships between formal sector&#13;
       job creation and wage growth and informal job creation and wage growth. Under the dualistic&#13;
       model, formal sector conditions will tend to be countercyclical to informality. As conditions for&#13;
       employment improve in the modern sector, informality declines. Under the alternative model,&#13;
       however, informal sector growth (in wages, employment) tends to cycle with broader economic&#13;
       growth. However, caution needs to be applied in interpreting these relationships, and a variety of&#13;
       evidence is helpful to get a better picture of the informal sector.&#13;
&#13;
       4.22     The evidence in the Kyrgyz Republic suggests the informal sector sops up agricultural&#13;
       job shedding. Using the LFS figures on employment , regression analysis of job growth outside&#13;
       farms and establishments to growth of jobs in establishments and growth of jobs in farms (with&#13;
       regional effects) suggests that informality is related to job shedding from farms, but there is not a&#13;
       statistically significant relationship between establishments jobs and â&#128;&#152;informalâ&#128;&#153; jobs (Figures Figure&#13;
       4.4Figure 4.5). This suggests that rather than being driven by entrepreneurs, it is primarily a haven&#13;
       for the otherwise unemployed farmers.&#13;

       4.23      The relationship between formal job growth as reported by establishments and&#13;
       informal job creation is negative. However, another source of evidence on the informal sector&#13;
       comes from the KER formal establishment data, from which we can compare dynamics with&#13;
       informal job growth. Over the 2009-2012 period, informal job creation was inversely related to&#13;
       job growth in formal establishments (Figure 4.6), again suggestive of a dualistic labor market, but&#13;
       with informality being the sponge that soaks up workers unable to access better formal sector work.&#13;
       When formal job creation expands, informality declines, and when the formal sector shrinks,&#13;
       informality increases, at least in aggregate. The evidence provides further support for aiding the&#13;
       formal sector to create jobs as a primary vehicle for improving the productivity of currently&#13;
       informal workers.&#13;

                                          C.    THE CHALLENGES OF GEOGRAPHY&#13;
&#13;
4.24    One of the challenges to creating greater jobs in the Kyrgyz Republic relates to its&#13;
challenging geography, which creates natural disadvantages to its ability to be competitive&#13;
exporters. The Kyrgyz Republic contends with natural disadvantages to merchandise trade. Not&#13;
only is it geographically remote, its landlocked status also heightens its dependence upon trade&#13;
passage through sovereign border countries, further increasing the risks and costs.&#13;
&#13;
4.25    The Kyrgyz Republic has taken advantage of its geography to date through cross-&#13;
border trading. Cross border trading has become one of the fastest growing services in the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic, and it optimizes the countryâ&#128;&#153;s geographic location. Small enterprises/individuals import&#13;
goods from China, taking advantage of the simplified tax regime for cross-border trade, and re-&#13;
export those items using the CIS preferential tariff. Markets like Dordoi â&#128;&#147; which employs some&#13;
60,000 workers â&#128;&#147; and Karasuu stock up on cheap manufactured goods from China and Turkey to&#13;
re-export to other CIS countries and beyond. Since 2000, re-exports have grown from comprising&#13;
a negligible portion of gross exports to accounting for almost 15 percent by 2013. As a shared of&#13;
manufactured exports, meanwhile, they have grown to account for almost 40 percent.&#13;
&#13;
4.26     Going forward, the Kyrgyz Republic will also need to improve the environment for&#13;
merchandise trade. Beyond being an engine of growth that can be sustained over time, trade is&#13;
good for jobs. Importantly, it requires particular skills specialized to the trade process. The KER&#13;
data provides a specific window into the job/trade relationship for the Kyrgyz Republic. While the&#13;
tally of exporters is incomplete (see Chapter 4 data box), it is possible to identify exporters and&#13;
assess differences in performance and employment outcomes with other producers27 Even KER&#13;
data shows that the job-creation capacity of exporting is higher than for domestic-bound&#13;
production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27&#13;
  It cannot be assumed that all of the â&#128;&#156;otherâ&#128;&#157; group are non-exporters, but reasonably the other group will&#13;
include a significantly larger portion of non-exporters, given they have not reported any accounts receivable&#13;
rom outside the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                   59&#13;
&amp;#12;4.27    Like other landlocked countries, the Kyrgyz Republic exhibits limited export&#13;
diversification in both export markets and products. At aggregate level, Kyrgyz trades more&#13;
than expected, a consequence of its superlative exports in gold. Outside of gold, however,&#13;
merchandise exports have been lackluster, growing from only 23 percent of GDP in 2000 to 26&#13;
percent in 2012. Product space analysis of the export basket of the Kyrgyz Republic indicates that&#13;
the diversity of exports is low, and there has been limited movement up the value chain. Products&#13;
have remained largely resource-based, and remain low value.&#13;
&#13;
4.28     The Kyrgyz Republic ranks poorly on a number of key indicators for trade logistics&#13;
and transport, even relative to other landlocked countries. The Kyrgyz Republic remains one&#13;
of the most logistics disadvantaged countries of even landlocked economies, and it has failed to&#13;
make substantial progress in improving logistics in the last 7 years (Figure 4.7). One of the greatest&#13;
disadvantages the Kyrgyz Republic faces with regard to trade is the distance from production&#13;
centers to seaports. While other landlocked countries average between 1,500 and 2,000 km to the&#13;
closest seaport, for Kyrgyzstan the distance is between 4,500 and 5,200 km.28&#13;

&#13;
4.29      There are significant job opportunities that come with incremental movements up&#13;
the value chain. Food production in the Kyrgyz Republic consists mostly of food sold in raw,&#13;
unprocessed states (see Table 4.1). Food processing requires significant financial investment&#13;
(processing equipment, machinery, storage, transport, etc.), as well as staff with specialized skills&#13;
(making connections between suppliers and agro-industry. The current Kyrgyz trade strategy&#13;
targets the development of four food processing sectors (in addition to tourism and clothing): fruits&#13;
and vegetables, dairy products, meat products, and bottled water. The strategy also targets four&#13;
cross-sectors â&#128;&#147; access to finance, trade information and promotion, quality management and trade&#13;
facilitation â&#128;&#147; to improve export competitiveness beyond the selected priority sectors.&#13;

&#13;
4.30    Other mountainous, landlocked countries provide some insights into overcoming&#13;
geographic challenges, even ones at completely different stages in development.               These&#13;
insights revolve around investments in transport and infrastructure to reduce the actual costs of&#13;
trade and increase cross border connectivity, encouraging production close to trading partner&#13;
borders, and specializing in exports that either capitalize on geography (such as mineral exports)&#13;
or are physically neutral (not being disadvantaged by their geography). Switzerland and&#13;
Liechtenstein, for example, both positioned themselves as â&#128;&#156;hubsâ&#128;&#157; for activities that donâ&#128;&#153;t require a&#13;
physical presence (for Switzerland, in banking, and for Liechtenstein in holding companies, where&#13;
&#13;

                                                   61&#13;
&amp;#12;companies establish registered offices primarily for tax purposes). Both also have developed highly&#13;
specialized niche industrial activities. Making trade work for jobs must consider this and a range&#13;
of other issues particular to the geographic context of the Kyrgyz Republic.&#13;
&#13;
 D.     MIGRATION RELATED CHALLENGES&#13;
&#13;
4.31     In addition to the indirect impacts of emigration on the economy and jobs through&#13;
remittances, migration has direct impacts on labor supply (emigration, by definition, reduces&#13;
the labor supply), as well as on the labor supply decisions of those left behind. Depending&#13;
upon the characteristics of migrants (or those who exit the labor force in response to migration&#13;
decisions at the household level), the economy could experience skills (or muscle) shortfalls, as&#13;
workers are drained from domestic markets. It is possible that the private sector is constrained by&#13;
skills shortages, which ultimately limit the ability for growth and further employment expansion.&#13;
&#13;
4.32    The evidence does not suggest skills are currently a major constraint to growth and&#13;
jobs creation in the formal sector or otherwise. First, the evidence on the characteristics of&#13;
migrants suggests that the bulk of migrants abroad are general secondary-skilled workers (Figure&#13;
4.8). Compared to the overall Kyrgyz population, migrants are younger, more likely to be male,&#13;
and are only moderately more skilled than the general population. The Kyrgyz migration&#13;
phenomenon is not occurring in higher skills, which is an important advantage for the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic.&#13;

&#13;
4.33    Moreover there is little evidence to suggest that secondary skills are in deficit.&#13;
Evidence on the stock of labor by education and employment status suggests that the bulk of&#13;
unemployment hits secondary educated workers (who also represent the large majority of Kyrgyz&#13;
workers). Tertiary workers comprise only about 20 percent of the labor force, and their&#13;
unemployment rates are significantly lower. While the low rates of tertiary unemployed could&#13;
suggest skills deficiencies, the rate of unemployment among tertiary educated workers has not&#13;
moved significantly over time (Figure 4.9).&#13;
&#13;
4.34    Returns to education estimates are neither suggestive of increasing skills gaps.&#13;
Relative to illiteracy, relative returns have risen and fallen for all workers, with relatively wide&#13;
variation (rising in 2007, falling subsequently with the global economic downturn, -and rising again&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       62&#13;
&amp;#12;                    in 2010) (Figure 4.10). The variation is not explained by migration patterns: between 2003 and&#13;
                    2012, migration grew continuously at a rapid pace. Sectors intensive in tertiary education have&#13;
                    exhibited similar patterns of growth and employment creation and those intensive in secondary&#13;
                    education. Finally, surveys of enterprises do not suggest skills to be a significant factor affecting&#13;
                    firm expansion.&#13;
&#13;
                    4.35    While skills constraints do not appear to be a significant factor at present in the&#13;
                    Kyrgyz jobs challenge (whether caused by migration or otherwise), longer term decisions on&#13;
                    education could lead to a skills constraint to future growth. The evidence on migration patterns&#13;
                    suggests that increasingly, migrants are opting for work abroad to staying in school, which is&#13;
                    concerning for future skills needs. Combatting this trend will require concerted efforts to&#13;
                    understand the decision making process of younger migrants, as well as a better environment for&#13;
                    jobs domestically.&#13;

&amp;#12;    E. THE MIGRATION SUCCESS STORY â&#128;&#156;TRAPâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
4.36     A final element that is a challenge for the Kyrgyz jobs agenda is the migration trap.&#13;
Finally, the Kyrgyz Republic faces perhaps its greatest challenge in overcoming the migration trap.&#13;
The migration driven model has allowed for both jobs abroad but also improved jobs outcomes&#13;
(while low value) domestically, through the booming service sector. The gains that the migration&#13;
model has brought are large.&#13;
&#13;
4.37     The challenge is to break free from a model that has raised wages and created&#13;
employment in low-wage service activities. Because of its success, there is a potential&#13;
indifference of government authorities to changing the environment for a different model.&#13;
Remittances have driven up tax revenues in Kyrgyz from 16 percent of GDP in 2000 to 28 percent&#13;
in 2013, and allowed the government to move the deficit from 10 percent of GDP to 4 percent,&#13;
without undertaking capital investments into the infrastructure that would support greater&#13;
investment in the country. Both direct taxes and indirect taxes (on imported goods) have risen with&#13;
increased demand due to remittance income.&#13;
&#13;
4.38    Overcoming the inertia of a model that has been successful will require a new way of&#13;
looking at jobs. For the private sector, the rules of the game for operating must encourage&#13;
innovation, expansion, and job creation over captive markets and rents. For the public sector, the&#13;
hiring and payment system must encourage qualified and dedicated career public servants over&#13;
opportunists. For the informal sector, the rules of the game must be changed to encourage formality&#13;
and access to knowledge, services and assets that improve income potential. The range of&#13;
challenges for the Kyrgyz Republic are large, and the stakes are large too.&#13;

      A.    NOTES ON DATA AND ANALYSIS AT THE FIRM&#13;
                            LEVEL&#13;
1.       Chapter 3 explores firm growth and employment dynamics in the formal sector using&#13;
firm panel data. Among the data sources used in this section, the Kyrgyz National Statistics&#13;
Committee collects several different reports on quarterly and annual bases from all establishments,&#13;
regardless of size, ownership structure, or activity (including, for example financial organizations,&#13;
public administration and non-profit organizations). Together, the financial reports submitted by&#13;
enterprises represent the complete set of registered establishments in operation. The reports contain&#13;
detailed information on inter alia: sales and expenses from which to calculate value added, profit,&#13;
and the like; investment; and employment, man-hours and labor compensation. Information is also&#13;
collected by which it is possible to determine each establishmentâ&#128;&#153;s ownership structure, geographic&#13;
location, main economic activity and, to some degree, age. The NSC itself utilizes this information&#13;
from establishments in its national accounts estimates, and it publishes various information about&#13;
establishments in a series of reports. It is from the NSC reports on establishments that the full&#13;
account of employment in registered establishments by economic sector is available. An almost&#13;
complete sample of the establishment data for the 2009-2012 period was made available to World&#13;
Bank staff for the purposes of this analysis. The data from these various financial reports can be&#13;
integrated by virtue of a unique firm ID common across reports, a task which was undertaken for&#13;
the purpose of this diagnostic (see for description of the Kyrgyz Establishment Reporting dataset,&#13;
referred to throughout this report as the KER). With more than 16,000 operational establishments,&#13;
the KER provides a unique opportunity to examine the dynamics of establishments in the Kyrgyz&#13;
Republic, and to assess the nature of firm entry, survival, growth, productivity, and job creation&#13;
within the formal sector.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The chapter also highlights the differences between the formal and informal sector&#13;
and the links between them. Utilizing the Kyrgyz LFS data (2003-2012), it is possible to provide&#13;
a characterization of formal versus informal workers, based on whether they reported working in&#13;
establishments or outside of establishments. As will be discussed, the number of workers who&#13;
report working in establishments from the LFS differs from the number of workers reported by&#13;
establishments to the NSC, but the aggregate figures are not far off, and for the purpose of&#13;
differentiating â&#128;&#156;formalâ&#128;&#157; (establishment) from â&#128;&#156;informalâ&#128;&#157; (outside establishments or farming), it&#13;
provides a reasonable if not exact gauge of differences in worker characteristics. Moreover, the&#13;
LFS allows for more granularity in the picture of informal (and formal) workers by economic sector&#13;
and oblast, which allows for a link from the formal sector production data from the KER to the&#13;
types of workers employed within (and without).&#13;

&amp;#12;     B.   REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF NET JOB GROWTH IN&#13;
                  FORMAL ESTABLISHMENTS&#13;
&#13;
1.      With the importance placed on encouraging productive job creation in almost all countries,&#13;
a considerable literature is devoted to understanding the mechanisms by which firms expand and&#13;
create jobs. This literature focuses both on understanding the key sources of net employment&#13;
creation in the economy (which firms are primarily responsible for job growth in the economy), as&#13;
well as understanding the characteristics of that job growth (particularly, for example, in terms of&#13;
firm performance).&#13;
&#13;
2.       In order to understand the mechanisms by which formal establishments create jobs, as well&#13;
as the characteristics of net job creation in Kyrgyz Republic, we undertake regression analysis&#13;
utilizing the KER establishment data. The advantage of the KER dataset is that it is broadly&#13;
representative of the productive formal sector, excluding known sectors (gold production, railroads,&#13;
public administration, and financial intermediation). The data also covers a period of four years,&#13;
and includes about 15,000 establishments present during one or multiple years, from which it is&#13;
possible to examine employment growth dynamics including entry and exit.&#13;
&#13;
3.      First, to determine the main source of net job creation, we replicate the econometric&#13;
strategy in Rijkers, et al (2014)29 and estimate employment-weighted firm-level regressions of net&#13;
employment growth, using as the measure of firm-level employment growth, í µí±&#148;í µí±&#150;í µí± í µí±¡ the change in&#13;
employment from year t-1 to year t, divided by average size:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
where í µí°¸í µí±&#150;í µí± í µí±¡ denotes employment in firm i of type s at year t. This measure is symmetric, bounded&#13;
by -2 and 2, and accommodates both entry and exit. By virtue of employment weighting30, the&#13;
mean of the dependent variable is equal to the appropriate employment weighted mean, and&#13;
coefficient estimates can be interpreted as employment weighted conditional means.&#13;
&#13;
4.       We consider several types of explanatory variables. To assess to what extent the observed&#13;
relationship between employment growth is due to starting firm size (for established firms), we&#13;
include dummies which categorize firms based on their original firm size, with the exception of&#13;
entrants who are universally categorized simply as entrants. Thus in one set of firm size/age&#13;
dummies we have 5 categories (of which 4 are included in estimations) for micro established firms&#13;
(1 employee in 2009), small established firms (less than 10 employees in 2009), medium&#13;
established (11-60 employees in 2009) and large established (more than 60 employees in 2009), as&#13;
well as entrants.&#13;
&#13;
5.      We also examine the impact of productivity and profitability, with both measured by a&#13;
ranking of firms within a distribution of 1-20 on total average profits/output per worker. These&#13;
&#13;
29&#13;
  Rijkers, et al. 2014.&#13;
30&#13;
  We employ two sets of weights. First, we weight according to base year employment. Because entrants&#13;
will, naturally, not have a base year employment, we weight by the first year of employment data (entry year&#13;
employment). In another set of estimates, we weight be average employment over the period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    68&#13;
&amp;#12;variables are included with the goal of understanding whether the relationships between firm size&#13;
and age and employment growth reflect performance differences associated with scale and across&#13;
the life cycle of the establishment. The use of the profitability and productivity ranks, as opposed&#13;
to levels, helps reduce the impact of extreme observations and thus measurement error while&#13;
allowing for both negative and positive values.&#13;
&#13;
6.        To examine the issue of smallness and potential obstacles to expansion beyond small status&#13;
(in this case beyond 9-10 workers), we also run the regression with a more elaborate breakdown of&#13;
size of firm. In particular, we break down with greater precision small and medium firms by the&#13;
number of workers in 2009 (for established operations) to determine how net job creation changes&#13;
by firm size. The particular interest is in understanding whether small firms (less than 10&#13;
employees) face a specific barrier to further job creation that other firms (firms which have&#13;
graduated beyond smallness) do not.&#13;
&#13;
7.       To assess whether firms decide between hiring labor versus capital (investment), we also&#13;
include a measure of investment (constructed as the average accumulated investment over the&#13;
period). Because investment information has only been completed by a small group of&#13;
establishments, we only include this variable in one set of estimations.&#13;
&#13;
8.       In one set of estimations we examine the impact of ownership structure (state-owned or&#13;
not) on employment growth. But in all cases, we restrict the analysis to value generating firms. In&#13;
all estimations, we include sectoral dummies&#13;
&#13;
9.       While we undertake the estimations for all firms, we also perform the estimations for a&#13;
restricted sample of growing firms, in order to better understand how firm size influences job&#13;
growth. If the relationship between net job growth and firm size is increasing in firm size for all&#13;
firms, but decreasing when the sample is restricted to growing firms, then we know that small firms&#13;
have lower job rates of job growth because they are less likely to grow, not because they are less&#13;
likely to expand.&#13;
&#13;
10.     Table B 1-Table B 4 present the results of our regressions. Table B 1 Table B 3 reflect the&#13;
sample of value creating firms only, while Table B 4 has two estimations including the whole&#13;
sample of establishments (including non-profits). For ease of understanding, the coefficients on&#13;
firm size are presented not relative to 0 but to the unconditional average of the omitted variable&#13;
(firms greater than 200 persons). The results from Table B 1-Table B 2 are displayed graphically&#13;
in Figure B 1Figure B 2. Several findings are worth highlighting.&#13;
&#13;
11.      First, it should be observed that for the full sample of establishments (not just growing&#13;
firms) the coefficients on firm size are all negative but for entrants. No firms created employment&#13;
(in net terms). Thus, the assessment of the contribution to net job growth in Kyrgyz is an&#13;
assessment of job loss, and which establishments contributed the least to that loss.&#13;
&#13;
12.     Second, in our full sample of value generating firms, and using the base size classification&#13;
of establishment size, job growth is positively related to the size of the firm. This remains true&#13;
when controlling for profitability or productivity. From Figure B 1, net job growth is lowest for&#13;
small firms and remains flat until around 10 workers, at which point the rate of net job growth&#13;
increases more sharply.&#13;
&#13;
13.      When the sample is restricted to growing firms only (firms in which value added grew over&#13;
the period, including entrants), the relationship between employment creation and firm size changes&#13;
considerably. First, the coefficients are positive, as growing firms as a group contribute positively&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 69&#13;
&amp;#12;to net job growth. Secondly, net job creation is highest for very small firms, and declines to&#13;
negative values after firms reach over 4 workers. Small firms which are growing have a much&#13;
higher rate of net job creation than larger firms (which shed workers, even growing firms). Thus,&#13;
the job creation/firm size relationship, at least for smaller firms, is really a job creation growth&#13;
relationship. Small firms in aggregate have much lower contribution to job creation in aggregate&#13;
because they have a much lower probability of growth (separate from their actual rates of growth,&#13;
which are also lower).&#13;
&#13;
14.     We cannot observe the age of the firm (other than entrants), but the sample of small firms&#13;
is obviously diverse and potentially includes a large number of young firms. Some of these younger&#13;
firms would be in the process of growing (and expanding employment, contributing like entrants&#13;
to job creation), but some of the would be either subject to the extreme churning process that&#13;
characterizes small firms (where survival rates are low) or at the level of small stagnation, no longer&#13;
expanding. On net, small firms do not contribute to job growth, but they contribute significantly&#13;
when they are in their growth period (presumably when young).&#13;
&#13;
15.      The results from the full sample of value-producing firms also suggests that job shedding&#13;
by small firms remains relatively similar across firm size until about 10 workers, at which point the&#13;
degree of job shedding declines (the relationship becomes more steeply positive). This suggests&#13;
that the ability to grow is most constrained for smaller firms, but once small firms graduate past&#13;
smallness, the growth job growth potential improves. The financial reporting of establishments&#13;
explicitly considers firms with fewer than 9 workers as â&#128;&#156;smallâ&#128;&#157;, and the reporting (and other)&#13;
requirements change for firms based on this graduation. Thus, the improvement in the capacity to&#13;
create jobs at the border of â&#128;&#156;medium sizedâ&#128;&#157; is suggestive of regulatory constraints that impede&#13;
expansion beyond 10 workers (or at least impede the reporting of employment beyond 10 workers).&#13;
&#13;
16.      When average size is used as the classification of employment size (full sample), the&#13;
relationship is everywhere upward sloping for all firm categories past 2, indicating that, in general,&#13;
large firms contribute more to employment growth than small firms (Figure B 2).&#13;
&#13;
17.      In our regressions which include measures of investment, there is no evidence to indicate&#13;
that establishments substitute hiring for capital investment. Rather the relationship is positive and&#13;
significant. This suggests that labor expansion is complementary to other investment in capacity.&#13;
In Figure B 3, it is also clear that the reporting of investment is highly similar to the relationship&#13;
for growing establishments, but in fact, the sample of firms that report investment is not&#13;
significantly different from the full sample of firms, in terms of growth (that is, the sample is not&#13;
biased toward growing firms). About 55 percent of investing firms are growing (versus the full&#13;
sample where about 51 percent are growing).&#13;
&#13;
18.     Finally, when measures of state-ownership are included, meanwhile, the relationship is&#13;
always positive and significant. While this is true in the case of including non-profits, it is&#13;
especially the case in value-generating establishments, where state-owned firms have a 25 percent&#13;
higher probability of creating jobs for any given size of firm and sector (Table B 3Table B 4).&#13;

            Transitioning to better jobs in the Kyrgyz
            Republic : a jobs diagnostic
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report takes an in-depth look at
            the development of jobs in the Kyrgyz Republic over the past
            decade to understand why the country has not realized better
            job outcomes. Drawing on evidence at the macro, household,
            and firm level, it examines key shortcomings in the current
            migration-led, remittance-driven development model that have
            weakened the country’s ability to create sufficient and
            high-quality employment opportunities and are likely to
            result in deteriorating job outcomes in the future. The
            report argues that several broad transformations will be
            needed to develop engines of growth in the Kyrgyz Republic
            outside remittances and shift to a better jobs path. The
            distortions and obstacles that currently prevent the
            expansion of private sector employment need to be unraveled;
            macroeconomic, regulatory, and logistical impediments to
            greater, more diversified export orientation need to be
            strategically addressed; the compensation of public
            employees must be reformed to reduce the level of corruption
            that discourages business growth; and the migration
            phenomenon, which will be a part of the employment mosaic
            for at least another decade, must be made to contribute to
            domestic employment creation and the country’s development.
