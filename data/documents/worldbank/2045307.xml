A. IMPACT OF THE DISASTER&#13;
1. BACKGROUND, CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DISASTER AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
1.     Zambia is currently experiencing its second consecutive year of poor harvests, which has led&#13;
to severe food shortages. During the 2000/2001 cropping season (December to April), excessive rains&#13;
in parts of the country led to flooding that destroyed crops over large areas. Districts in the Eastem&#13;
and Southern Provinces along the Zambezi and Luangwa rivers were the most affected. Production of&#13;
maize, the staple crop, fell by an estimated 24 percent from the year earlier. During the most recent&#13;
2001/02 cropping season, erratic rains and long dry spells during the growing season hit part of the&#13;
same districts and several districts in other provinces, resulted in low agricultural output and&#13;
exacerbating an already precarious food situation. About 38 of the 73 districts are estimated to be&#13;
directly affected by drought, but the hardship arising from this drought will be felt in several other&#13;
districts and in urban centers.&#13;
2.     Zambia has faced recurring droughts during the last decade, including the severe 1991/92&#13;
drought, which affected the whole of southern Africa. A partial drought in 1995 and the el niubo&#13;
weather phenomenon in 1998, led to significant shortfalls in production. During the 1991/92 drought,&#13;
marketed production from many of the country's best maize-producing areas was the lowest in&#13;
recorded memory. The surplus that is normally carried from one season to the next did not exist, nor&#13;
was it possible to import significant quantities of maize from other neighboring countries, as they&#13;
were all suffering from the same drought. Widespread regional food shortages occurred again during&#13;
2001/2002.&#13;
3.     Although several factors have contributed to food shortages (including insufficient attention&#13;
paid to smallholder agriculture, policies that favor urban businesses over farmers and consumers over&#13;
producers, policies that distort prices and interfere with markets, and poor infrastructure), weather-&#13;
related factors have been important. Rainfall in Zambia is unimodal, commencing with light rains in&#13;
December, gradually diminishing in February and March, and ending in April. District rainfall data&#13;
collected over the last thirty years and disaggregated by month shows that rainy seasons have&#13;
gradually been starting later and finishing earlier in Zambia, particularly in major maize producing&#13;
districts.' The trend of decreasing precipitation is quite apparent for February, March and April.2&#13;
Maize in Zambia is most vulnerable to moisture stress from January to March. Thus, low rainfall&#13;
during these months can lead to crop failure even when the average annual rainfall is normal. This&#13;
3&#13;
occurred during the 1991/92 growing season leading to the worst crop failures of the past fifty years.&#13;
A similar pattern of erratic rainfall is reported in the current year.&#13;
2. CAUSES OF THE CRISIS&#13;
4.     Vulnerability to drought and crop failures has increased during the past years in Zambia for a&#13;
number of interrelated factors. These include:&#13;
HIV/AIDS. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has significantly increased the number of vulnerable&#13;
people. High morbidity and death reduces the rural workforce, leaving farms neglected. The&#13;
Kruss, Phillip D. "Drought and Climatic Change in Zambia", draft article, December 1992.&#13;
2      Meteorologists working in eastern and southern Africa have shown that precipitation levels throughout&#13;
the region declined by about 15 percent prior to the end of the nineteenth century, subsequently showing little&#13;
change until about 1960. In Zambia, recent studies indicate that the mean precipitation during the 1980s was&#13;
approximately 10 percent lower than during the 1960 and 1970s (Kruss, 1992).&#13;
3      The impact of the droughts has been exacerbated by the shift in eating habits of Zambians away from&#13;
diversified traditional foods that were grown in micro ecosystems. The shift was essentially completed in the&#13;
1970s, with maize then being the staple for the whole country and every farmer trying to grow maize regardless&#13;
of the suitability the ecosystem to the maize production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
elderly, orphans, households headed by women, and households with disabled or ill members&#13;
that do not receive support from other households are particularly vulnerable.&#13;
&#149; Input supply policies. Due to budgetary constraints the government has had increasing&#13;
difficulty in delivering fertilizers to farmers. Inputs are either distributed to most farmers&#13;
either late or not at all. The private sector has not filled the gap due to inconsistent input&#13;
supply policies which have discouraged private sector investment in this area. The reliance&#13;
on government for the provision of fertilizer has created a legacy of dependence, which has&#13;
proved difficult to remove.&#13;
*  Strategic food reserve. Chronic underfunding and inappropriate specification of the scope of&#13;
activities of the Food Reserve Agency has prevented the agency from maintaining an&#13;
adequate strategic food reserve. The grain reserve stock in warehouses of the Food Reserve&#13;
Agency is depleted and needs to be augmented immediately.4&#13;
a  Excessive dependence on maize. State support for maize has led to excessive dependence on&#13;
maize as a staple food. Smallholder farmers even in areas that are not well suited for maize&#13;
cultivation rely on maize for maize for food, increasing their vulnerability to crop failure.&#13;
This is gradually changing, but more needs to be done to reduce dependency on one crop for&#13;
food.&#13;
3. DAMAGE ASSESSMENT AND ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACT&#13;
Economic impact&#13;
5.     Due to the extensive crop failures, lack of altemative sources of income, and gaps in the&#13;
formal and informal safety nets, approximately 2.9 million people require direct food assistance&#13;
monthly through March 2003 when the next crop will be harvested. This is 27 percent of Zambia's&#13;
population.&#13;
6.     According to the joint FAO/WFP assessment, the shortfall in cereals production (largely&#13;
maize) is 635,000 metric tons, which is just 51 percent of Zambia's annual cereal needs. The value of&#13;
the shortfall (measured at replacement cost) is approximately US$160 million. The full impact of the&#13;
drought is yet to be felt. However, early indications are that the drought will have adverse impact on&#13;
economic growth, the exchange rate, inflation, the government budget, and balance of payments. The&#13;
most affected groups are smallholder farmers who rely on the food from their farms for subsistence,&#13;
and the urban poor who will face higher food prices. The death and sale of livestock and sale of seed&#13;
stocks to purchase food will also constrain the ability of vulnerable households to recover from the&#13;
drought.&#13;
7.     The government has appealed to the international community for assistance to augment the&#13;
grain supply, to provide targeted income support to those in need, and to assist in preparing for the&#13;
coming agricultural season. According to current estimates, the international community will donate&#13;
approximately 175,000 metric tons of food aid, with a value of US$44 million. Private businesses in&#13;
Zambia are likely to import significant quantities of food, up to 300,000 metric tons, although orders&#13;
have lagged. To date, the government has allocated about US$ 18 million to import about 65,000&#13;
metric tons of grain. However, as food shortfalls have increased and the food from intemational&#13;
donors and private sector commercial imports has been slow to materialize, the govemment has&#13;
increasingly been procuring maize, and has placed an order to purchase another 230,000 metric tons&#13;
of grain at a total cost of US$58 million. Because of the shock to the mining sector earlier this year,&#13;
4      The Food Reserve Agency was established in 1996 by an act of parliament to maintain a national&#13;
strategic food reserve. It has subsequently become a major instrument for public intervention in input and&#13;
output markets.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the government's ability to address a food crisis of this magnitude is significantly diminished. Hence&#13;
additional support is needed.&#13;
Social impact&#13;
8.     The impact on households from the crop failure is severe. Many smallholder farmers who&#13;
grow food for their own consumption and for income are now forced to buy food from market, but&#13;
have little income to do so. The urban poor, who in normal years spend up to 60 percent of their&#13;
incomes on food can scarcely afford to pay ever higher prices. Thus, households have to make short-&#13;
term tradeoffs. Many of these involve households shifting resources from investment intended to&#13;
provide long-term benefits to immediate consumption (for example, keeping children out of school so&#13;
that they can earn wages or search for food). In addition to its impact on food supplies, the drought&#13;
has in the heavily hit districts reduced the quantity of available clean water. In the worst-affected&#13;
provinces, acute malnutrition and related illnesses and infections are likely to increase significantly as&#13;
people reduce their food intake, ingest contaminated water, and cut back on medical care (which&#13;
requires out-of-pocket expenditures).&#13;
9.     Central, Eastern, Southern, and Western Provinces, the provinces worst affected by the&#13;
drought, account for over 40 percent of the almost 1 million orphans in the country resulting largely&#13;
from the HIV/AIDS crisis. The decline in the purchasing power of households in these areas will&#13;
make it that much more difficult for families to care for people infected with HIV/AIDS, orphaiis,&#13;
widows, and, indeed, all vulnerable people who traditionally rely on family and community social&#13;
support networks in times of need. The traditional mutual assistance and family networks were even&#13;
in a normal agricultural years grappling with the need to care for an overwhelming number of&#13;
orphans. The food shortages this year will increase the number of people needing assistance, while at&#13;
the same time reducing the capacity of families and communities to cope.&#13;
10.   Moreover, the harvest failures are making worse of an already poor school attendance record&#13;
of children from poor and HIV/AIDS-affected families. Even prior to the drought, the national&#13;
enrollment rate declined from 85 percent in 1996 to 77 percent in 2001 (Ministry of Education,&#13;
Situational Analysis). Enrollment in rural areas is far worse than the national averages, with&#13;
attendance in 2001 standing at only 61 percent of eligible children. There are reports that enrollment&#13;
in the areas most affected by the drought is down again this year from earlier years.&#13;
B. GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE&#13;
1. INITIAL RESPONSE&#13;
11.   In June 2002, the government declared a national disaster and issued an appeal for&#13;
humanitarian aid to enable the country to meet its food needs and to mitigate the impact of the&#13;
drought on government operations. The government in close consultation with the UN agencies and&#13;
bilateral donors, took a number of initiatives to deal with the crisis. These include: (a) providing food&#13;
relief to severely affected households, mainly through the coordinated food aid from the WFP (which&#13;
plans to contribute 175,000 metric tons of grain); (b) facilitating commercial maize imports of about&#13;
300,000 metric tons; (c) financing government purchases of the remaining balance; (d) distributing&#13;
seeds and other agricultural inputs and organizing demonstration and dissemination of drought-&#13;
resistant cultivation practices such as conservation farming to restore agricultural production; (e)&#13;
providing extension support to affected communities, particularly to mitigate the effects of drought on&#13;
livestock; (f) constructing, rehabilitating, and deepening boreholes in drought-affected areas through&#13;
donor-assisted schemes, and (g) rehabilitating rural feeder and access roads.&#13;
12.   In September 2002, after further reviews the food situation indicated that inflows of food&#13;
were less than expected and the population affected greater than expected (2.9 million people&#13;
compared with the original estimate of 2.3 million), the government decided to increase its purchases&#13;
of maize to 300,000 metric tons (65,000 metric tons are expected to be delivered in October and&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
November 2002, and a new order was placed in September 2002 for 235,000 metric tons for delivery&#13;
between December 2002 and April 2003). This is intended to compensate for the likely shortfall in&#13;
food aid arising from the government's delay in reaching a decision on whether to use genetically-&#13;
modified maize for human consumption, the limited private sector imports to date, and the increased&#13;
estimates of the population in need of direct food aid. If the govemment decides to allow use of&#13;
genetically-modified maize, it will reduce its imports and probably increase assistance in milling the&#13;
genetically-modified maize received through food aid.&#13;
2. THE GOVERNMENT'S DROUGHT MITIGATION PLAN&#13;
13.    The government in its Drought and Mitigation Plan, October 2002 has articulated its drought&#13;
mitigation policies, strategies, and interventions for the short, medium, and long terms. For the&#13;
immediate and short terms, the government will target assistance to save lives and economic assets,&#13;
particularly of the poor. For the medium term, the government will support farmers in restoring&#13;
output in the next cropping season, while continuing to provide targeted safety net measures to assist&#13;
Zambia's most vulnerable people. Measures will include securing food supplies and distributing them&#13;
to the affected people, providing safe drinking water, distributing agricultural inputs for the next&#13;
cropping season, offering animal health services, repairing infrastructure (such as access roads,&#13;
bridges, and rail tracks), and refurbishing transport equipment. The government will also continue its&#13;
safety net programs. The total cost of implementing the plan is estimated at US$276 million.&#13;
14.   To reduce Zambia's vulnerability to drought and other natural disasters and shocks in the&#13;
longer term, the government will strengthen the early warning system; build capacity for drought&#13;
planning and management; and implement actions to enhance food security and to increase household&#13;
incomes, thereby increasing the number of rural households with the capacity to cope in the face of&#13;
natural disasters. The government's implementation strategy for the drought recovery and mitigation&#13;
effort is built on three pillars: (a) working jointly with the multilateral and bilateral donors, the private&#13;
sector, such as the millers, importers/transporters, wholesalers and retailers; (b) deploying&#13;
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) jointly with public agencies in implementing programs; and&#13;
(c) establishing transparent and accountable arrangements for implementation and oversight at the&#13;
national, district, and community levels.&#13;
3. GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST FOR WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE&#13;
15.    On August 13 and August 27, 2002, the government asked the World Bank to provide&#13;
emergency assistance for drought recovery. The request is for about US$50 million to finance food&#13;
imports needed to meet emergency requirements, measures aimed at helping groups most affected by&#13;
drought, and distribution of agricultural inputs for the next crop season.&#13;
C. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
1. PROPOSED BANK RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST&#13;
16.    The Bank intends to respond to the govemment request for emergency assistance in two&#13;
ways. The first is to assist in meeting immediate needs. This will be done by (a) financing critical&#13;
imports of goods and essential commodities and other goods; (b) helping to provide drinking water&#13;
supplies, fodder for animals, health services, and the like to people affected by the drought; and (c)&#13;
assisting with procurement and distribution of agricultural inputs, rehabilitation of key agricultural&#13;
infrastructure, and provision agricultural services needed to restart agriculture.&#13;
17.   The second is to support medium and long-term measures to reduce the vulnerability of&#13;
people to future natural events. This will be done by supporting the government's efforts to&#13;
strengthen its early warning system, build its capacity to manage natural disasters, and enhance its&#13;
social safety net system. A proposed Agricultural Development Project (under preparation) will&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
support efforts to diversify rural livelihoods, improve water and soil management, and introduce&#13;
drought-resistant technologies and farming practices.&#13;
2. THE PRSP FRAMEWORK AND EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE&#13;
18.   The basic building blocks of the Bank's CAS for Zambia (IDA/R99-156/1) are removing&#13;
constraints for sustainable, diversified growth, improving governance, and increasing basic services&#13;
and direct poverty interventions. The objective of the CAS has been to sustain positive growth rates&#13;
and show that the economic reforms are beginning to show tangible and measurable benefits for the&#13;
poor. The base case program assumed that the copper industry would be privatized and that HIPC&#13;
decision point would be reached before the end of the CAS period. These were achieved in the&#13;
stipulated time frame. During the same period, the PRSP was presented to the Board and is in its first&#13;
year of implementation (IDA/SecM2002-253). For obvious reasons, neither the CAS nor the PRSP&#13;
anticipated that a natural disaster on the scale of the 2001/02 drought would occur, and hence did not&#13;
present a scenario applicable to coping with the disaster.&#13;
19.   Immediately after the joint assessment report (government, United Nations, and NGOs) on&#13;
the current food supply situation was issued, the Bank received a request from the government for&#13;
emergency assistance. Bank management reviewed the request and authorized the immediate&#13;
preparation and appraisal of an emergency drought recovery project. The mission sent to prepare and&#13;
appraise a project recommends:&#13;
&#149; Redirecting undisbursed funds of up to US$21 million from selected on going IDA operations to&#13;
targeted safety net and other rehabilitation activities that are aimed at mitigating the effect of&#13;
drought on the most affected population in the immediate and medium-terms.&#13;
* Providing quick-disbursing financial assistance of US$50 million to support critical imports,&#13;
activities to relieve the suffering of the affected population, initiatives to increase next year's&#13;
production (2002/03), and activities complementing the govermment's direct efforts to provide&#13;
food and other assistance to the affected population.&#13;
* Financing a new agricultural diversification and commercialization project (US$40 million)&#13;
through the proposed Agricultural Development Support Project that supports (a) monitoring of&#13;
food security and developing the early waming system; (b) productivity enhancing interventions;&#13;
and (c) activities to sustainably manage water and soils. These measures will reduce the risks&#13;
arising from drought in the long run.&#13;
3. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
20.    Lessons learned from previous emergency operations have been taken into account in the&#13;
design of the project, and the project preparation/appraisal has benefited from the advice of teams&#13;
involved in responding to similar emergencies in other countries. Key lessons reflected in the project&#13;
design are:&#13;
* Including measures to enhance government's capacity to monitor food security and detect&#13;
impending harvest shortfalls, plan effectively to mitigate their impact, and efficiently manage&#13;
actions for recovery is very important. Had this been pursued following the last severe drought of&#13;
1991/92 the country may have been better able to cope with the current drought. The project&#13;
includes measures to strengthen the govemment's early waming system and to improve its&#13;
capacity to mitigate and respond to emergencies.&#13;
a  Emergency operations must be simple, rapidly executable, and not burdened with conditionality.&#13;
This project is simple, focuses on supporting activities that are already underway and on&#13;
importing key commodities, and includes no policy-oriented conditionalities.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
*  Interventions shouldfocus on meeting the needs of the most vulnerable groups in society. This&#13;
project supports the government's safety net programs.&#13;
*  The operation shouldfocus on sectors immediately affected, and not undertake too broad an&#13;
agenda of cross-cutting issues. This project is narrow in scope, supporting just critical imports&#13;
and government initiatives that are already underway.&#13;
*  Commitment and ownership of the borrower are criticalfor successful implementation. This&#13;
project responds to the government's direct appeal to the Bank for aid.&#13;
* Speed in preparation, appraisal, and implementation are critical elements of success. Preparation&#13;
of this project started on Sept 9, 2002. Preparation was completed in two weeks, and the project&#13;
was negotiated on October 10, 2002. This compares with the average project preparation time for&#13;
Zambia of 18 months. The project's simple, focused design, and its reliance on existing&#13;
institutional structures and arrangements for implementation will almost certainly guarantee that&#13;
the project is completed within the two years envisaged.&#13;
4. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
21.    The proposed emergency support is fully consistent with the Bank Group's overall assistance&#13;
strategy for Zambia. It also supports the government's own Drought Recovery and Mitigation Plan,&#13;
October 2002, which focuses primarily on immediately providing food and other essential goods and&#13;
services to the affected population, as well as helping farmers restore agricultural output in the next&#13;
season.&#13;
22.    For the Bank and the government, ensuring a stable macroeconomic framework has been a&#13;
priority before the emergency and will continue to be so while the government deals with the&#13;
economic and social shocks of the drought. Bank's involvement at a time when the country is&#13;
experiencing a major drought shock will help the government maintain its key commitments to social&#13;
and economic reforms and to the investment priorities that are contained in its PRSP. It will also help&#13;
restore the productive capacity of the affected population. The poor will suffer most if the&#13;
government is not able to mobilize additional resources to finance essential imports and maintain its&#13;
expenditures on social services and infrastructure, which is crucial to reduce poverty over the longer&#13;
term. Thus, the Bank's emergency assistance would ensure that essential long-term expenditures are&#13;
not compromised while the government makes available food supplies in drought-affected areas and&#13;
to the poor. In addition, the Bank's assistance will enable the government to partially mitigate the&#13;
income shocks on the vulnerable, to allow them to access food and other essential goods and services&#13;
through targeted safety net interventions (such as employment through public works and distribution&#13;
of agricultural inputs entailing cash or in-kind income supplements). As part of the discussions on&#13;
Bank assistance for drought recovery, the government and the Bank have agreed to complement the&#13;
emergency credit with resources from the existing portfolio, to be realigned towards targeted safety&#13;
net interventions. The resources from the existing portfolio complement and do not substitute for the&#13;
emergency operation because the focus of support and timing of disbursements differ from those of&#13;
the emergency credit.&#13;
23.    The proposed emergency assistance also responds to the consolidated appeal issued by the&#13;
United Nations on behalf of Zambia and supported by bilateral donors and multilateral agencies. In&#13;
addition, the Bank has considerable experience in emergency operations, including response to&#13;
drought, and will be able to respond quickly under its quick disbursing credit. Moreover, 40 percent&#13;
of the assistance will be through an IDA Grant. This response would be part of the overall Bank&#13;
effort to provide drought relief in the most affected countries of the southem Africa region.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
D. EMERGENCY DROUGHT RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
1. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
24.    The overall objectives of the project are to assist the government in maintaining key&#13;
commitments to its economic and investment priorities laid out in the PRSP, and to help restore&#13;
productive capability of the affected population. It is aimed at helping the government to respond&#13;
effectively to the current drought, and to supplement government's effort and resources: (a) to prevent&#13;
starvation and malnutrition in the affected human population; (b) to support other identified drought&#13;
mitigation measures such as providing drinking water, improving critical transport and logistics links,&#13;
supporting health and sanitation services, providing support to keep children in school, protecting the&#13;
threatened livestock population; (c) to support farmers to raise crops in the next agricultural season;&#13;
and (d) to enhance government capacity for longer-term disaster management, including through&#13;
support for developing an effective early waming system.&#13;
2.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
25.    The proposed operation comprises four components:&#13;
(a)    Quick-disbursing assistance to finance a positive list of imports. The positive list of imports&#13;
will include (i) machinery and equipment; (ii) agricultural inputs; (iii) petroleum products; (iv)&#13;
construction materials; (v) transport vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles; (vi) livestock and animal health&#13;
products and veterinary supplies and equipment; (vii) school supplies and equipment; (viii) medical&#13;
supplies and equipment. In aggregate, the imports financed under the fast-disbursing component&#13;
would be used to help restore agricultural production, improve access of rural people to markets and&#13;
services through repair and improvement of rural roads and bridges, and help maintain educational&#13;
and medical services.&#13;
(b)    Safety net interventions aimed at improving access to markets and services by vulnerable&#13;
groups (public works). The government intends to provide employment and improve access to&#13;
markets by expanding its public works programs under ongoing projects such as the Road Sector&#13;
Investment Program, and to invest in removing critical transport bottlenecks. The project will support&#13;
this effort.&#13;
(c)    Distribution of a package of agricultural inputs and technologies (production rehabilitation)&#13;
for the next cropping season to households severely affected by drought. Farmers who cultivate less&#13;
than a hectare of land, lost their crop to drought, lost their cattle and draft animals, households with&#13;
HIV/AIDS patients and who support orphans and the handicapped, child-headed households, and&#13;
women-headed households will benefit from this intervention.&#13;
(d)    Improving early warning system and disaster management and mitigation capacity of the&#13;
government through technical assistance, training, and studies.&#13;
3. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
26     The size of the proposed credit and grant of US$50 million is based on the govemment&#13;
request for emergency assistance and the assessment of the mitigation program and foreign exchange&#13;
requirements. The proposed credit would finance 100 percent of the delivered cost of eligible imports&#13;
on the positive list, excluding import duties and taxes, and 100 percent of the cost of consulting&#13;
services to support project implementation.&#13;

4.    IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
27.    Project implementation period. The project will be implemented over a period of 24 months&#13;
from November 2002 to November 2004.&#13;
28.    Project organization and management. The Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit&#13;
(DMMU) of the Office of the Vice President will be responsible for project implementation and&#13;
coordination. The DMMU is the government's arm for disaster management and mitigation planning,&#13;
and is backed up by a structured oversight mechanism for policy, program review, and coordination.&#13;
At the apex, is a cabinet committee, the National Disaster and Relief Committee (NDRC), chaired by&#13;
the vice president. The NDRC is served by (a) a technical committee that comprises the permanent&#13;
secretaries of the concerned ministries, and (b) a joint steering committee (being established)&#13;
consisting of the key government ministries and agencies, the concerned UN agencies, key NGOs,&#13;
and selected private sector organizations. The joint steering committee acts as a forum for&#13;
information sharing, periodic consultation, coordination, and oversight of the disaster mitigation&#13;
program. It also makes recommendations for the consideration of the NDRC.&#13;
29.    At the provincial level, implementation of the disaster relief program is overseen by&#13;
provincial disaster management committees, and at the district level by district disaster management&#13;
committees. Prominent NGOs, other local stakeholders, and the private sector are represented on&#13;
these committees. The participatory and representative character of the institutional arrangements for&#13;
drought mitigation and management continues down to the community level. Here satellite&#13;
committees, called community welfare assistance committees, participate in drought mitigation&#13;
planning and management activities. These include carrying out household surveys, preparing&#13;
beneficiary lists, determining household food gap and relief food entitlements, and overseeing food&#13;
and other relief distribution by the field implementing agencies (generally the NGOs). The&#13;
committees comprise community elders and other community representatives.&#13;
30.    The DMMU and the World Food Program, which share tasks related to the distribution of&#13;
relief food, have engaged nearly 29 NGOs to distribute food and to manage the food-for-work&#13;
programs approved for the area. Through these mechanisms, the government has been able to&#13;
establish a fairly transparent and accountable arrangement for program administration, which is&#13;
considered satisfactory for implementing the initiatives supported by the proposed project.&#13;
31     Under the proposed project, support has been provided (a) to strengthen the DMMU by&#13;
recruiting key specialists who would assist the DMMU in the short term to implement a time bound&#13;
program under a quick disbursing credit, and provide training to the local government staff to build its&#13;
capacity; and (b) to catalyze the development of government capacity in the long term to handle&#13;
droughts and famines and other disasters. The support for the long-term measures includes: (a)&#13;
strengthening the capacity of the national meteorology office's for data analysis and forecasting; (b)&#13;
providing technical assistance for streamlining and strengthening the institutional and organizational&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
arrangements for early waming; (c) reviewing and finalizing government's disaster mitigation and&#13;
management policy; (d) preparing a national drought and famine code; and (e) strengthening data&#13;
collection, monitoring, and dissemination systems in the key government agencies. Studies carried&#13;
out as part of these activities will make recommendations of investments to improve and strengthen&#13;
the system over time. The government has agreed to implement the recommendations under ongoing&#13;
and proposed investment operations supported by the World Bank and other donors.&#13;
5. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
32.    Financial management. The financial management capacity of the DMMU was assessed and&#13;
found to be inadequate under the existing arrangements. This is especially due to DMMU not having&#13;
an in-house accounting unit. Consequently, it is proposed that DMMU establish an accounting unit to&#13;
be headed by a qualified and experienced financial management consultant. The financial&#13;
management consultant will be expected to design a flexible financial management system that is able&#13;
to record, account for, and report on a timely basis all transactions through the Special Accounts.&#13;
Monthly and quarterly financial monitoring reports will be produced. The reports will include&#13;
financial statements with statement of sources and use of funds, uses of funds by components and&#13;
activities and disbursement categories; and physical progress reports in relation to the performance&#13;
indicators previously set. The records, accounts, and financial statements of the project will be&#13;
subject to an annual external audit in accordance with the terms of reference and by independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to IDA. Furthermore, the government intemal audit will be effectively utilized in&#13;
carrying out physical progress monitoring of activities (including the distribution of agricultural&#13;
technology packs to vulnerable farmers, and the physical progress of the public works component) in&#13;
addition to their internal audit reviews of all documentation and compliance with the legal agreements&#13;
for all expenditures relating to the project.&#13;
33.    Disbursements. The DMMU will operate two Special Accounts under the credit and one&#13;
Special Account under the grant. The Bank of Zambia will maintain one Special Account each under&#13;
the credit and grant through a reputable international bank to handle imports by both the private and&#13;
public sectors. The DMMU will enter into an agreement with the Bank of Zambia, which will set the&#13;
responsibilities and modalities of how the Special Account will be operated. The second Special&#13;
Account under the credit will be established and maintained in a comnmercial bank acceptable to IDA&#13;
and will serve other investment operations, such as the safety net, agricultural inputs and capacity&#13;
building interventions. In addition, DMMU will maintain a Kwacha denominated Project Account in&#13;
a commercial bank acceptable to IDA to hold Government's counterpart fund contributions under the&#13;
credit. Government will make an initial deposit of US$100,000 equivalent into the Project Account to&#13;
finance Government's contribution to the project, and replenish the Account thereafter and not later&#13;
than February 28, 2003 with US$382,000 equivalent. The amounts deposited into the Project&#13;
Account will be used to finance eligible expenditures under the project.&#13;
34.    Disbursements will be done using statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures for those&#13;
expenditures that are below the SOE threshold. The DMMU will initiate the withdrawal applications&#13;
for the initial deposits to the Special Accounts. The signing arrangements will be on a two-panel&#13;
basis. Panel A will consist of accounting staff, and panel B will comprise DMMU management.&#13;
Release of funds will require one signature from each panel. All bank accounts will be reconciled&#13;
monthly, and identified differences will be expeditiously investigated.&#13;
35.    External audit. Audited financial statements for the credit and grant will be submitted to the&#13;
Bank within six months after the financial year-end. The audit will be carried out by suitably&#13;
qualified auditors appointed under terms of reference acceptable to IDA.&#13;
36.    Retroactivefinancing. As perrnitted in OP 8.50 on emergency recovery assistance,&#13;
retroactive financing in the amount of US$ 10 million equivalent, 20 percent of the credit and grant&#13;
amount, will be provided to finance eligible expenditures of the private and public sector for imports&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
incurred not earlier than four months before signing of the Development Credit Agreement and the&#13;
Development Grant Agreement.&#13;
37.    Grant funding: Zambia qualifies for grant funding under IDA 13 Replenishment Agreement&#13;
approved on July 25, 2002. Therefore, US$20 million will be provided as a grant, which will be&#13;
about 40 percent of the Emergency Recovery Assistance.&#13;

6. PROCUREMENT&#13;
38.    Procurement of Goods, Works and Commodities in the positive list will be governed by the&#13;
Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits published in January 1995 and&#13;
revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999. The Bank's Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents (SBD) and Standard Bid Evaluation Forms will be used. However, for the quick&#13;
disbursement component, the currency provisions in the SBDs will be suitably amended to make them&#13;
more responsive and consistent with standard practice in intemational trade.&#13;
39.    Consultant services contracts financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers&#13;
published in January 1997 and revised in September 1997 and January 1999 and May 2002. The&#13;
Bank's Standard Request for Proposals will be used for Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS)&#13;
and Standard Forms of Contract as needed (lump-sum, time-based, and/or simplified contracts for&#13;
short-term assignments and individual consultants) and also the Sample Form of Evaluation Report&#13;
for the Selection of Consultants.&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40.    Importsfor retroactivefinancing. The Zambia market structure is unique in the following&#13;
way: (a) most imports are from manufacturers in South Africa, (b) imports are controlled by parent&#13;
companies based in South Africa, and (c) most equipment importers are agents of specific&#13;
manufacturers of equipment. This structure does not appear to easily lend itself to competition raising&#13;
a major issue in the eligibility of such imports for financing under the project. The issue of market&#13;
structure in Zambia coupled with recent structural changes in the petroleum sector made it difficult for&#13;
the mission to determine eligibility of recent imports for retroactive financing. The largest recent&#13;
single import has been crude oil but there was no information on the process used by the govemment&#13;
to decide on the company that imported the latest consignment of crude oil. For crude oil to be&#13;
financed under this credit in future the importer must have been selected on the basis of open&#13;
competitive bidding. The govemment is now adjudicating (September 2002) a tender for importation&#13;
of 900,000 metric tons of crude oil and such supply may be eligible for financing under the credit and&#13;
grant. The next major recent import has been petroleum products by the oil marketing companies.&#13;
The oil marketing companies import from their parent companies in South Africa who must have&#13;
imported the crude oil in bulk on the basis of intemational commodity prices. It is therefore assumed&#13;
that sound commercial practices were used by the parent companies and therefore for retroactive&#13;
financing purposes these products would be eligible. In addition, since there is price competition at&#13;
the pump, it is in the best interest of each company to import the products at most competitive prices.&#13;
Other imports considered eligible for retroactive financing are fertilizer inputs (imported by Nitrogen&#13;
Chemicals), urea (imported by Nitrogen Chemicals, Omnia and Sasol), pharmaceuticals (imported by&#13;
Gamma Pharmaceuticals) and school supplies (imported by Sobi Industries). The following is a&#13;
proposed allocation of the US$10.0 rnillion (20 percent of the credit and grant).&#13;
Petroleum Products  -      US$5.0 million&#13;
School Supplies     -      US$1.0 million&#13;
Fertilizer inputs   -      US$1.0 million&#13;
Urea                -      US$2.0 million&#13;
Pharmaceuticals     -      US$ 1.0 million.&#13;
41.   Institutional arrangements. The DMMU shall be the main executing agency. The team&#13;
executing the project, comprising a coordinator, an accountant, a procurement expert, and a logistics&#13;
expert will work in close collaboration with the staff of the logistics and operations section of the&#13;
DMMU, and report to the national coordinator. The staff will be engaged through a competitive&#13;
process by advertising the positions in a widely circulated national paper. The DMMU shall prepare&#13;
the terms of reference for all the positions and immediately start the recruitment process. The DMMU&#13;
has a tender committee with members from the Zambia National Tender Board, the DMMU&#13;
(secretariat), the Ministry of Finance and National Planning, and the Ministry of Works and Supply.&#13;
Due to the emergency nature of the operation, the Zambia National Tender Board has delegated&#13;
authority to the tender committee to approve and award contracts. Further, the DMMU has the&#13;
mandate to appoint members to the tender committee from the various ministries depending on the&#13;
nature of the procurement&#13;
42.    Procurement capacity. A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) is currently&#13;
being undertaken in Zambia to review the ongoing Public Procurement Reforms as recommended in&#13;
the 1997 CPAR. The main objective of the review has been to assess the implementation of the 1997&#13;
CPAR action plan. The main recommendations were (a) to decentralize of the procurement function&#13;
to procurement units in the ministries, (b) to establish a cadre of professional procurement staff and&#13;
supporting training institutions in training, (c) to strengthen the audit and oversight function of the&#13;
Zambia National Tender Board, (d) to create the advisory council, and (e) to revise the Tender Board&#13;
Act. The CPAR exercise has concluded that the rate of progress of the implementation of the 1997&#13;
CPAR action plan has been very slow with only six ministries being decentralized and the Zambia&#13;
National Tender Board still undertaking the procurement function with very minimal oversight&#13;
activities. Further, there has been professional procurement training carried out but the professional&#13;
procurement cadre has yet to be established. New guidelines and regulations have been developed&#13;
and are in use, but there is need for revisions to be carried out. The need to undertake a review and&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
amendment to the current legislation has also been recommended. There are proposals to establish a&#13;
Zambia national procurement authority and an independent complaints body. There has been&#13;
recognition of the need to build on to the achievements attained so far to ensure the implementation of&#13;
the procurement reforms in Zambia is completed. The findings of the 2002 CPAR are yet to be&#13;
presented to the cabinet for approval.&#13;
43.    A procurement capacity assessment was undertaken of the DMMU in accordance with&#13;
OPCPR instructions of July 15, 2002. Though DMMU has been handling disaster operations on&#13;
behalf of government, the institution has no previous experience in implementing an operation of this&#13;
magnitude and involving the number of agencies being proposed for this credit. In addition, DMMU&#13;
has no experience of implementing a Bank financed project. Currently, the section in DMMU that&#13;
will be responsible for implementing the Emergency Drought Recovery project is understaffed with&#13;
only one member of staff in the section while the rest of the positions in the establishment have not&#13;
been filled yet. The lack of procurement capacity at the DMMU is one of the most important issue in&#13;
this project. To mitigate the risk, DMMU is planning to employ two procurement experts. The first&#13;
expert will be employed as a regular DMMU staff to fill a procurement position in the DMMU and&#13;
will be financed by the govemment. The second expert will be a consultant who will work on the&#13;
project in collaboration with the DMMU procurement staff. This consultant will be familiar with&#13;
Bank procurement policies and procedures and specific knowledge in the procurement of&#13;
commodities will be an advantage. Employment of these two experts is critical to the success of the&#13;
project.&#13;
44.    For the safety net component (component b) the National Roads Board (NRB) has been&#13;
implementing community based civil works projects under Bank financed projects and has&#13;
procedures, which have been approved by the Bank. The current project has been implemented on the&#13;
basis of community identification of scope of work and community contribution of specific&#13;
percentage of inputs, but in this project the Public Works Program shall be implemented on the basis&#13;
of cash for work with no requirement for contribution from the communities. The communities shall&#13;
provide the unskilled labor for the civil works and be paid cash. A new selection criteria has been&#13;
developed and the scope of works and sites will be based on a pre-determined and targeted areas in&#13;
the 38 beneficiary districts as identified by the NRB through the districts. NRB already has a list of&#13;
the subprojects to be undertaken from the Feeder Roads Project in the Ministry of Local Govenmment&#13;
and Housing and the tendering process for the selection of the contractors has progressed to the award&#13;
of contract stage.&#13;
45.    Procurement plans. The DMMU will procure some of the items contained in the positive list:&#13;
some goods (computers, fumiture and vehicles), civil works, technology packs, consultancy services&#13;
and training. The DMMU shall be responsible for preparing the consolidated procurement plan for all&#13;
the components. The procurement plans will show the step-by-step procedures and processing times&#13;
for procurement including: contract packages for goods, works, consultant services and training;&#13;
estimated cost; procurement/selection method; bidding, evaluation and contract award; the activities&#13;
which follow contract signature such as manufacture, shipment, delivery and installation of goods;&#13;
mobilization, construction and completion of works. Considering the short duration of the project, the&#13;
procurement plans will be reviewed quarterly.&#13;
46.    Procurement methods. The procurement methods to be used are presented in Table A below.&#13;
47.    QUICK-DISBURSING ASSISTANCE (component a). The quick-disbursing assistance is&#13;
composed of US$10.0 million for retroactive financing and US$25.0 million for future procurement.&#13;
Both private and public sectors will benefit from the quick-disbursement assistance, but for eligibility&#13;
the procurement arrangements will be slightly different.&#13;
48.    Private Sector Procurement. Procurement of all commodities may be done in accordance&#13;
with clause 2.65 of the Guidelines. For all non-commodity items in the positive list, modified&#13;
intemational competitive bidding will be used for all contracts estimated to cost US$500,000 or more&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
per contract. Contracts for non-commodity items estimated to cost less than US$500,000 per contract&#13;
may be procured using commercial practices acceptable to the Bank&#13;
49.    Public Sector Procurement. Modified ICB procedures will be used for contracts estimated to&#13;
cost US$150,000 or more while international shopping will be employed for contracts estimated to&#13;
cost less than US$150,000. All contracts above US$150,000 will be subject to prior review.&#13;
50.    SAFETY NET INTERvENTioNs (component b). The procurement arrangements defined in&#13;
NRB's operational manual will be revised to include the cash for work criteria, guidelines, procedures&#13;
and implementation arrangements to be used by the EDRC. These arrangements will be agreed with&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
51.    DISTRIBUTION OF A PACKAGE OF AGRICULTURAL INPUTS AND TECHNOLOGIES (component c).&#13;
For the technology pack, DMMU will contract three or four NGOs to supply farm inputs to farmers in&#13;
four zones. The NGOs will be selected through National Competitive Bidding using the following&#13;
process. The DMMU will first divide the drought-affected districts into three or four different&#13;
geographic zones with each zone having a given number of farmers to be served. A pre-qualification&#13;
exercise will be carried out to determine qualified NGOs to supply and distribute the packs. The pre-&#13;
qualification process will involve inviting applications from NGOs through advertising in at least two&#13;
local papers of wide national circulation. Because of the urgency, the NGOs will be given two weeks&#13;
to prepare their applications. The DMMU, with the assistance of other stakeholders, will evaluate the&#13;
applications and decide on the qualified NGOs. The pre-qualified NGOs will then be asked to quote&#13;
for the supply and distribution of the technology pack to the given number of farners in each zone.&#13;
The bidding document would stipulate that contracts will be awarded based on the capacity and&#13;
experience of the pre-qualified NGOs. Such capacity will be verified both at the time of pre-&#13;
qualification and at the of bidding based on information submitted and physical verification, where&#13;
required. In other words, NGOs will be pre-qualified for one or more zones depending on their&#13;
capacity and experience, which will again be verified at the time of evaluation of bids and prior to&#13;
contract award.&#13;
52.   IMPROVING EARLY WARNING SYSTEM AND DISASTER MANAGEMENT AND MITIGATION&#13;
CAPACrIY (component d). For goods (vehicles, furniture and computers) all contracts estimated to&#13;
cost more than US$150,000 per contract will be procured through ICB. Contracts estimated to cost&#13;
less than US$150,000 will be procured through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) using bidding&#13;
documents acceptable to the Bank. Contracts estimated to cost less than US$50,000 may be procured&#13;
through national shopping. All the ICB contracts will be subject to Bankes prior review. Works&#13;
contracts estimnated to cost more than US$50,000 but less than US$500,000 shall be procured through&#13;
NCB. For works contracts estimated to cost US$50,000 or less, the contracts shall be procured under&#13;
lump sum fixed price contracts on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified domestic&#13;
contractors invited in writing to bid. The invitation shall include a detailed description of the works,&#13;
including basic specifications, the required completion date, basic form of agreement acceptable to&#13;
IDA and relevant drawings where applicable. The award will be made to the contractor who offers&#13;
the lowest price quotation for the work provided they demonstrate that they have the experience and&#13;
resources.&#13;
53     Consultancy services. Consultancy services, for firms estimated to cost US$ 100,000 or more&#13;
will be procured through the QCBS selection method. Consultancy contracts for firms estimated to&#13;
cost less than US$ 100,000 will be procured through the Consultants Qualifications method.&#13;
Consultancy services for financial audits and external evaluations will be procured through least-cost&#13;
selection method. Consultancy services that meet the requirements of paragraphs 3.8 to 3.11 of the&#13;
Consultant Guidelines may be procured through single-source selection method with the prior&#13;
approval of IDA. Individual consultants will be selected on the basis of their qualifications in&#13;
accordance with Section V of the Consultants Guidelines.&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54.    Procurement monitoring. During project implementation, the DMMU will provide quarterly&#13;
reports on progress of procurement highlighting difficulties encountered in the past, and how they&#13;
would be addressed in the future to ensure timely project completion. There will be procurement&#13;
supervision every six months, which will include special procurement supervision for post-&#13;
review/audits. During these missions, IDA will review one in five randomly selected contracts, which&#13;
are below the prior review thresholds specified above.&#13;
55.    Prior review thresholds. Prior review thresholds are presented in Table B. The threshold for&#13;
prior review for all the items under the quick disbursement component will be US$500,000 or more&#13;
for the private sector. Contracts for goods estimated to cost US$150,000 or more under the DMMU&#13;
component will be subject to prior review.&#13;
56.    All works contracts estimated to cost US$250,000 or more will be subject to prior review by&#13;
IDA.&#13;
57     Contracts for consultant services estimated to cost US$ 100,000 or more for firms and&#13;
US$50,000 or more for individual consultants will be subject to prior review by IDA. Terms of&#13;
reference and Single Source Selection for all consultant services will require prior review by IDA&#13;
regardless of the contract value.&#13;
58.    These prior review thresholds may be updated after the first year of the project based on&#13;
satisfactory project performance.&#13;

7. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
59.    The proposed project is an emergency operation but it also contains measures to strengthen&#13;
the capacity of the country to cope with natural events over the medium and long terms. It will assist&#13;
the government to strengthen its early waming system, to establish effective drought management&#13;
arrangements, and to develop a cohesive and responsive longer-term safety net framework (at the&#13;
central and the district govemment levels). Appropriate plans will be drawn up for capacity building&#13;
in the govemment and other cooperating institutions. This will create in the long term appropriate&#13;
capacity in the government to address natural events such as periodic droughts and floods, as well as&#13;
other economic shocks.&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60.    Currently under preparation is a Bank-supported agricultural sector development program for&#13;
Zambia, which is being framed within the context of the PRSP, and which focuses on the critical role&#13;
that agriculture must play in pro-poor sustainable development and growth. This project will assist&#13;
the government in implementing medium and long-term measures to diversify agriculture, increase&#13;
access to inputs, improve market infrastructure and information, encourage more reliable and&#13;
ecologically sustainable agricultural practices, encourage more sustainable alternative land uses, and&#13;
reduce dependence on livelihoods vulnerable to drought, such as farming with traditional crops. It&#13;
will promote demand-based technology generation, and build capacity of the private sector and of&#13;
NGOs to effectively deliver key services in rural areas. These measures are expected to enhance food&#13;
security, increase incomes and reduce poverty, and thereby increase the number of rural households&#13;
that can cope with stressful natural events. The proposed emergency project fits well within a series&#13;
of initiatives planned or under implementation that are designed to promote household food security,&#13;
enhance welfare, and strengthen household capacity to face droughts. In addition, the emergency&#13;
operation will support social safety net operations through either existing or enhanced mechanisms.&#13;
These interventions are expected to be scaled down at the end of their implementation period once&#13;
food production returns to normal. The longer-term objective is to strengthen the nation's social&#13;
safety net system, to enable the government to respond rapidly to people's needs during emergencies,&#13;
while continuing to assist the most vulnerable during normal times.&#13;
8. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
61.    There are no significant environmental issues arising from this project. The rural roads&#13;
interventions, which are mainly spot improvements within existing rights of way, have triggered&#13;
safeguard policies and the operation is classified as Category B. Therefore, the operation will have its&#13;
own environmental and social assessment framework, and a resettlement policy framework. These&#13;
will provide the basis, mechanisms, and guidelines for screening, assessment, and mitigation&#13;
measures to be applied during implementation.&#13;
E. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
1. PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
62.    Major benefits expected to accrue from the project are: (a) increased likelihood that the&#13;
government will be able to prevent deaths and illness from the present food shortages; (b) ability to&#13;
maintain investments in health and education which are critical to longer-term poverty reduction; (c)&#13;
enhanced capacity for the most vulnerable groups to access goods and services by providing&#13;
temporary employment and income supplements though public works and other targeted&#13;
interventions; and (d) improved access to services, inputs, and markets in rural areas; and (e)&#13;
strengthened early warning system and enhanced capacity for disaster management in the future. The&#13;
project will complement the assistance provided by other donors and agencies and act as a catalyst for&#13;
additional assistance.&#13;
2. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
63.    The operation faces several risks. Delays may occur in delivery of the humanitarian&#13;
assistance pledged by donors. The current debate on genetically-modified food may reduce the&#13;
amount of food aid that can be delivered and made available in the country. Transporting and&#13;
distributing food to remote areas of the country may prove difficult. So far, the amount of food aid&#13;
and commercial imports has been very limited and the additional food requirement has to be imported&#13;
in a period of three to four months, if starvation is to be avoided. In the event of late orders or&#13;
logistical bottlenecks, a large number of Zambians may be severely impacted by the effect of drought&#13;
despite the best efforts of all parties concerned. To mitigate this risk, the Bank will provide support to&#13;
the government to facilitate delivery of essential commodities to the affected population and to&#13;
strengthen the DMMU with a qualified and experienced logistics manager. Moreover, a condition of&#13;
16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
effectiveness is that the government establishes a comrnittee consisting of all the key donors to&#13;
coordinate, monitor, and report on pledges, shipments, movement of food and supplies, and&#13;
distribution to beneficiaries.&#13;
64.    Lack of transparency and mismanagement of relief food is also a risk. This risk will be&#13;
minimized by establishing effective mechanisms for reporting, monitoring, and auditing; consulting&#13;
with and involving communities in the operation; and providing regular public information. The&#13;
effective operation of the joint steering committee and the strengthened the DMMU will minimize a&#13;
further risk of fragmentation and insufficient coordination by the various actors.&#13;
65.    Low local capacity for management may also hinder operations. Involving NGOs and&#13;
communities in implementing the project will minimize this risk.&#13;
66.    A final risk relates to the danger of reverting to the "business as usual" once the crisis abates,&#13;
without putting into place strengthened capacity to forecast and to manage future crises. This risk is&#13;
being addressed by strengthening the goverrnent's early warning system and capacity for disaster&#13;
management. Weather patterns are unpredictable, and there is no guarantee that adverse condition&#13;
will not persist next year. Thus, the present operation will enhance govermment's capacity to&#13;
recognize problems as they develop and to respond appropriately.&#13;

EMERGENCY DROUGHT MITIGATION PLAN&#13;
As you are aware from my earlier correspondence seeking IDA's assistance towards&#13;
mitigating the effects of the drought which has gripped Zambia, it is absolutely necessary&#13;
to have a Plan of the measures to address these effects.&#13;
We intend to address the drought situation at three levels namely the immediate and&#13;
short-term by targeting to save life, particularly of the poor and economic assets such as&#13;
livestock; the medium-term by targeting capacity of the poor to produce adequate food&#13;
for themselves during the next coming season which starts in December and in the long-&#13;
term by creating planning and management capacity to effectively handle future natural&#13;
disasters and other shocks.&#13;
Our implementing strategy for the drought recovery and mitigation effort is pillared on (i)&#13;
involvement of donors willing to participate and the private sector such as the millers&#13;
importers/transporters, wholesalers and retailers; (ii) deploying mainly non-governmental&#13;
agencies in implementing the programme on the ground and (iii) establishing transparent&#13;
and accountable systems for implementation and oversight at the community, district&#13;
and national levels.&#13;
Find attached hereto the government's Emergency Drought Mitigation Plan.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1: Government Drought Management and Mitigation Plan&#13;
Policy, Strategy and Interventions&#13;
Background&#13;
Arising mainly from adverse weather conditions that prevailed during the last two successive&#13;
agricultural seasons (2000/01, 2001/02) Zambia is in the grip of a food crisis, and approaching famine&#13;
conditions, principally in five of its nine provinces (Southern, Eastern, Lusaka, Central and Western)&#13;
affecting some 2.9 million people. Among these, about one million people in vulnerable groups such&#13;
as households headed by elderly, women and children; disabled and chronically ill; widows not&#13;
supported by other households; orphans; and people living with HIV/AIDS are at greater risk.&#13;
Therefore, under threat are the national and household food security as a result of 51 percent decline&#13;
in national maize production; low levels in the quantity and quality of potable water for humans and&#13;
livestock which would result in poor sanitation and could cause outbreak of epidemics such as&#13;
cholera, diarrhea, measles; and further worsening of the already poor nutritional status in Zambia&#13;
(stunting in children aged 5 and below 53 percent, underweight at 24 percent and wasting at 5&#13;
percent) leading to higher mortality. The drought threatens, not only the country's population, but&#13;
also its economy and would negatively impact on Govemment programs for growth and poverty&#13;
alleviation.&#13;
In May 2002, the Govemment declared the food emergency in the country as a national disaster and&#13;
issued an appeal for humanitarian aid. At the same time, a number of other initiatives were taken to&#13;
deal with the crisis, which include, (i) provision of food relief to severely affected households; (ii)&#13;
facilitation of private sector maize import; (iii) financing part of the purchase of strategic food&#13;
reserves; (iv) construction and rehabilitation of drinking water systems in drought affected areas; (v)&#13;
rehabilitation of rural feeder/access roads, and (vi) promoting food-for-works programs to augment&#13;
the income of vulnerable groups.&#13;
The UN system also launched its Consolidated Appeal on July 17, 2002. FAO, UNDP, UNICEF,&#13;
UNFPA, and WFP will assist emergency relief operations. In addition, bilateral and a number of&#13;
national and international NGOs have become key partners in this effort. Priority actions planned as&#13;
emergency response include provision of adequate food relief; access to water, health and nutrition;&#13;
education; safety net programs aimed at vulnerable groups; seed distribution; and promotion of&#13;
conservation farming practices. The countries and groups that have pledged their support so far for&#13;
these initiatives include USA, Netherlands, UK, Germany, Japan, and the European Union.&#13;
Meeting the Challenges of Drought&#13;
The Government intends to address the drought situation at three stages-the immediate and short term,&#13;
which would be targeted at saving lives and economic assets, particularly of the poor, such as&#13;
livestock; the medium term measures that ensure adequate agricultural production in the next cropping&#13;
season so that impact of the drought does not extend beyond the next harvesting season; and the long&#13;
term measures, which would include the Government's drought planning and management capacity to&#13;
handle natural disasters and other shocks effectively in future. The long-term measures would include&#13;
interventions under the proposed World Bank -supported Agricultural Development Support Project,&#13;
and other donor supported projects, which are expected to enhance food security, increase incomes&#13;
and reduce poverty, and thereby enlarge the number of rural households with a better coping capacity&#13;
in the face of natural disasters. The Government's implementation strategy for the drought recovery&#13;
and mitigation effort is built on three pillars. The first is to work jointly with the multilateral and&#13;
bilateral donors, the private sector such as the millers, importers/transporters, wholesalers and&#13;
retailers; the second is to deploy mainly the non-Governmental agencies in implementing the&#13;
programs on the ground; and the third is to establish transparent and accountable arrangements for&#13;
implementation and oversight at the national, district and community levels.&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Strategic and Immediate Government Actions&#13;
1. Emergency Food Supply&#13;
Zambia's estimated total maize production during the 2001/02 agricultural season is 51 percent below&#13;
the last normal annual crop, thus giving a food deficit of about 634, 000 metric tons. The Govemment&#13;
assessed the specific food needs of the affected populations in the 38 districts through vulnerability&#13;
assessment and mapping exercises undertaken jointly with the UN agencies and the NGOs following&#13;
the May 02 crop forecast. The communities through their local committees were closely associated&#13;
with the food assessment, and in preparing the household need list which would be the basis for food&#13;
distribution.&#13;
Taking cognizance of this situation, the Govemment has arranged to secure food supplies through the&#13;
private sector, bilateral donor assistance, WFP, and through Govenmment's own budgetary resources.&#13;
In the light of donor pledges and deliveries of relief food to date, lagging private sector imports and&#13;
increase in the estimate of the population that will be affected by the drought, the Govemment has&#13;
estimated that it may need to procure as much as 300,000 metric tons on its own account. The&#13;
Govermment has awarded contracts for importing 300,000 metric tons of maize, of which 65,000&#13;
metric tons is arriving in October/November 2003 and the balance would follow in subsequent&#13;
months. This will meet the food relief requirement, which donors and WFP may fail to deliver, and&#13;
the private sector is expected to import the balance 300,000 metric tons as agreed with millers in early&#13;
July 2002. Depending on the amount of food aid received for relief purposes, govemment purchased&#13;
maize would be used to replenish the strategic food reserve.&#13;
2. Food Distribution Policies and Mechanisms.&#13;
The Government food procurement and distribution policy and program is govemed by the following&#13;
key principles: transparency and efficiency in government purchase of food items and other items&#13;
procured for drought mitigation; food pricing polices that are non-distortionary and consistent with&#13;
the price and market liberalization policy; reaching the vulnerable groups affected by the drought;&#13;
removing transport bottlenecks that would prevent the flow of food to vulnerable groups; monitoring&#13;
the food situation and the implementation of the mitigation plan.&#13;
Transparency and Efficiency of Procurement. The Govemment is committed to ensuring&#13;
transparency in the procurement of food and other drought mitigation items, and will strictly follow&#13;
the Govemment procurement procedures or intemationally acceptable commercial practices. Where&#13;
donor funds are involved, Govemment will use procurement guidelines acceptable to the respective&#13;
donors. In addition to price factors, timeliness of delivery and product quality will influence decision&#13;
regarding selection of suppliers in this time of emergency. Govemment is committed to full&#13;
disclosures and audits of public sector transactions.&#13;
Food Pricing Policy. Zambia's agricultural product markets and prices are fully liberalized and it is&#13;
the Govemment's policy and intention to avoid interventions that have the potential to distort markets&#13;
and prices. Three modes of food distribution will be implemented to mitigate the drought. The first is&#13;
commercial maize distribution where the consumer pays market prices for food. This is a&#13;
predominant food distribution mechanism and the govermnent will further create an environment&#13;
conducive for its efficient performance. The second is distribution of relief food at no cost to&#13;
individuals and households that meet certain eligibility criteria (See Attachment I for selection&#13;
criteria). The third is thorough public works program  where individuals and households would&#13;
participate in the rehabilitation and maintenance of roads and other infrastructure in return for&#13;
payments in cash or in kind (food), to augment incomes of vulnerable groups. The agency that&#13;
implements the food for work program buys the food at market prices, or it could be food designated&#13;
for relief purposes, and the cash paid is used to buy food at market prices.&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Reaching the Vulnerable Groups. The Disaster Mitigation and Management Unit (DMMU) under the&#13;
Office of the Vice President currently performs the function of delivering food relief to the vulnerable&#13;
groups. It works very closely with UN organizations, particularly WFP, in the distribution of relief&#13;
food. With the assistance of the District Disaster Relief Committees (DDRC) and the community -&#13;
level relief committees called Satellite Committees the DMMU conducts the household food survey&#13;
and compiles the household food requirements aggregated to district, regional, and national level, and&#13;
these form the basis of food supply planning, procurement and distribution. The information thus&#13;
compiled is then validated through an arrangement of scrutiny by a national joint team consisting of&#13;
the key Govemment ministries/agencies, the UN System such as the WFP, FAO and the prominent&#13;
NGOs. The available food aid is provided to households based on a combination of geographic&#13;
targeting (districts where production shortfalls were highest) and key indicator-based targeting.&#13;
Targeting criteria for households include: female headed households; child headed households;&#13;
households headed by the disabled; households supporting orphans; households with HIV/AIDS&#13;
patients; and households with less that one hectare of land to cultivate. The most vulnerable groups&#13;
are placed on a separate list and provided with free food rations (about 20 percent of the affected&#13;
households generally qualify), and the remaining are on the list of food assistance provided generally&#13;
through food-for-work.&#13;
For food distribution to beneficiaries who meet the selection criteria, the DMMU has signed&#13;
Memoranda of Understanding with 29 international/national NGOs who distribute food to the&#13;
beneficiaries listed in close collaboration with the Satellite Committees, and under the overall&#13;
supervision of the DDRC. Nearly 80 percent of the food to the able-bodied is given under food-for&#13;
work programs and the designated NGOs have the responsibility of managing the food-for- work&#13;
program approved by the district relief committees for the designated communities. DMMU carries&#13;
out its oversight responsibilities for the proper food distribution through supervisory visits and&#13;
periodic meetings with the district agencies. DMMU has three regional offices that assist in the&#13;
performance of its field activities, provincial/district coordination, supervision, and investigation of&#13;
complaints and grievances.&#13;
Removing Logistical Bottlenecks. The government's basic strategy in dealing with the task of moving&#13;
relief materials to the people in the affected 3 8 districts is to ensure coordination of the activities of all&#13;
those involved in the ordering, shipment, certification, customs processing, storage and distribution of&#13;
relief food and other drought mitigation items. By so doing, it aims to avoid the bunching of the&#13;
arrival of relief materials, minimize double handling, reduce storage and transport costs. The&#13;
government also intends to take steps to improve the systems in place for tracking internal movement&#13;
of relief materials thus ensuring their safe and timely distribution to beneficiaries. Steps will also be&#13;
taken to ensure that institutional barriers are removed to allow full utilization of logistical resources&#13;
available within the country. The SADC Logistics Office also coordinates Zambia's logistical needs&#13;
in the region that is located in Johannesburg, South Africa.&#13;
To address logistics problems at the district level, the government intends to (i) make improvements&#13;
to the rural road network in key locations in the 38 affected districts through food/cash for works&#13;
programs; (ii)-repair and rehabilitate some presently unserviceable pontoons; (iii) install bailey&#13;
bridges at critical river crossings; and (iv) repair and rehabilitate some tractors and procure new ones.&#13;
The government is also taking steps to ensure that needed bridge strengthening is carried out at key&#13;
locations and that the rail tracks/beds of the Zambian Railways and TAZARA are strengthened at&#13;
known weak points before the onset of the rainy season.&#13;
Monitoring the Food Situation and Implementing the Plan. The Govemment has in place institutional&#13;
arrangements for disaster mitigation planning and management, and a structured oversight mechanism&#13;
for policy formulation, program review and co-ordination. The Office of the Vice President has the&#13;
overall responsibility for disaster management, and a department of this Office headed by a director -&#13;
Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU)- is the nodal agency for planning and&#13;
coordinating disaster management. At the apex is a Cabinet Committee chaired by the Vice President&#13;
and called the National Disaster and Relief Committee (NDRC). NDRC is served by a Technical&#13;
21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Committee, which comprises of the permanent secretaries of the concemed ministries. A subordinate&#13;
committee of technical specialists supports the technical committee. Because of the need for&#13;
coordination and consultations with the UN system, donors, NGOs and other stakeholders, the&#13;
Government has decided to establish a Joint Steering Committee (JSC) comprising of the key&#13;
government ministries/agencies, the concemed UN agencies, key NGOs with major implementation&#13;
responsibility, and selected private sector organizations. This committee would be chaired by the&#13;
Permanent Secretary in the Office of the Vice President, with DMMU acting as its secretariat. The&#13;
JSC would act as an effective forum for information sharing, periodic consultation, coordination, and&#13;
oversight of the disaster mitigation program, and make recommendations to the NDRC.&#13;
In the field, the District Disaster Management Committee oversees implementation of the disaster&#13;
relief program at the provincial level by the Provincial Disaster Management Committee, and at the&#13;
district level. Prominent NGOs, other local stakeholder institutions and private sector are represented&#13;
on these committees. This participatory and representative character of the institutional arrangement&#13;
for drought mitigation and management continues down to the community level where Satellite&#13;
Committees comprising of the community elders and other community representatives participate in&#13;
drought mitigation planning and management activities such as household surveys, preparing&#13;
beneficiary lists, determining household food gap and relief food entitlement, and oversight of food&#13;
and other relief distribution by the field implementing agencies (generally the NGOs). The DMMU&#13;
and the Word Food Program, who share tasks related to the relief food distribution, have engaged&#13;
nearly 29 NGOs to distribute food in the districts/areas respectively assigned to each, and to manage&#13;
the food-for-work programs approved for the area. Through these mechanisms, the Government has&#13;
on the ground a fairly transparent and accountable arrangement for program administration,&#13;
monitoring and implementation.&#13;
Medium-Term Interventions and Actions&#13;
The Government plan for drought recovery consists of interventions proposed broadly in two main&#13;
categories: securing food supplies and distribution to the affected populations, and non-food relief&#13;
measures such as drinking water, repairs to infrastructure for access roads, support with seed and&#13;
fertilizer packages to help affected farmers grow next year crop, and measures for assisting the most&#13;
vulnerable. The following are some of the non-food interventions that are discussed in greater detail&#13;
in Attachment 1.&#13;
Water and Sanitation. The water scarcity in several parts of the affected districts is quite severe, and&#13;
is particularly acute in the 11 districts of the Southern province. The Government strategy to redress&#13;
the situation is to rehabilitate the existing drinking water sources in the most affected areas, and to&#13;
create new water points through a borehole-drilling program where the existing sources cannot be&#13;
revived. For this rehabilitating the existing fleet of drilling rigs, purchase drilling bits and other&#13;
materials for carrying out the drilling program, and purchase of new rigs would augment the drilling&#13;
capacity of the Department of Water Affairs. In order to expedite the construction/rehabilitation of&#13;
water points the Government would use extensively available drillers in the private sector.&#13;
Infrastructure Improvement. Making improvements to the rural road network in key locations in the&#13;
38 affected districts using labor intensive work methods as well as repair and rehabilitation of some&#13;
presently unserviceable pontoons and bailey bridges at critical river crossings, and repair and&#13;
rehabilitation of old equipment and acquisition of new equipment are some of the key Government&#13;
interventions envisaged under this drought mitigation plan.&#13;
Social Safety Net Interventions. The Government will implement social safety net schemes for&#13;
different groups of the populations affected by the drought. This will include (i) addressing the failure&#13;
in household incomes by expanding the labor-intensive works opportunities for cash-for-work and&#13;
food-for-work; (ii) protecting education outcomes in terms of school attendance through an&#13;
emergency school feeding program and expansion of its targeted bursaries programs; (iii) protecting&#13;
22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
drought-affected people's access to safe water and sanitation, essential for nutrition and health, by&#13;
rehabilitating boreholes and sanitation facilities in drought affected areas.&#13;
The public works program will aim to alleviate the impact of the drought on vulnerable populations&#13;
and improve their livelihoods by providing in-kind (food and/or inputs) or cash assistance to&#13;
households to facilitate their access to essential goods and services. The program will aim to&#13;
supplement incomes of the most vulnerable populations in drought-affected areas of Zambia for a&#13;
period of 18 months through labor intensive road and other infrastructure improvement activities.&#13;
Support for Next Crop Season. The Government will initiate a number of agricultural programs&#13;
aimed at restoring the productive capability of the agriculture sector, particularly, the smallholder&#13;
farmers affected by the drought. A program that provides agricultural inputs, training in appropriate&#13;
land and water management techniques to improve the capacity of an expanded number of targeted&#13;
farmers to engage in agricultural production for the upcoming season (2002/3) is in place and the&#13;
necessary preparations underway. The intervention shall be implemented within the framework of the&#13;
introduction of Technology Packs carried out by NGOs in the last two years free of charge to eligible&#13;
participants. The main technological components of the program will be fertilizer, seed and planting&#13;
materials distribution and introduction of conservation farming (including soil fertility inputs). The&#13;
government will also implement an emergency animal disease control program targeted mostly at&#13;
diseases of an epidemic nature to protect livestock against mortality and decreased production.&#13;
The Government short- and medium term interventions in the agricultural sector will remain&#13;
consistent with the current and long-term sector development polices and are designed to enhance the&#13;
participation of private sector and NGOs in the distribution of inputs and the provision of agricultural&#13;
services. The private sector is participating in the implementation of a public program under which&#13;
private firms distribute agricultural inputs to farmers who receive partial matching grants from the&#13;
Government. This is an income-augmenting scheme that is designed to support farmers who can&#13;
make contribution towards the cost of inputs to adopt improved technologies resistant to drought.&#13;
Capacity Building. Recognizing the deficiencies in the current arrangement the Government is&#13;
committed to build up appropriate capacity for early waming, planning comprehensive mitigation&#13;
measures, and timely and efficient implementation of the mitigation plans.&#13;
Cost of the Mitigation Plan&#13;
The total cost of the drought mitigation effort in both the private and public sectors over a two year&#13;
period is about USDUS$276 million. Based on the original Government request to the World Bank, it&#13;
is expected that US$50 will come from IDA and have proposed allocations for interventions as&#13;
indicated in Attachment III. The Government will also use about US$21 million from ongoing IDA&#13;
supported projects for drought mitigation purposes, i.e., to implement safety net interventions aimed&#13;
at augmenting incomes of vulnerable groups. The Govemment has secured about US$44 million&#13;
assistance from other donors, of which about US$20 million is for food aid. The private sector will&#13;
import about US$62 million worth of food and agricultural inputs. Government expenditure for the&#13;
drought emergency from the 2002 budget is estimated at US$32 million. This leaves a gap of about&#13;
US$ 66 million, of which US$60 million is for food imports that need to be met before May 2003.&#13;
The Govemment intends to make provision in its 2003 budgetary resources, a well as the use of&#13;
suppliers credit if additional food aid assistance cannot be obtained from bilateral and multilateral&#13;
sources.&#13;
23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The government will use the US$50 million that it is expecting from IDA to supplement its foreign&#13;
exchange positions and to support the recovery program. Part of the proceeds of the IDA assistance&#13;
will be allocated through the budget to support safety net interventions, such as the public works&#13;
programs and the agricultural production and rehabilitation interventions, and to maintain economic&#13;
and social priorities of the PRSP. In addition, the government will allocate from its 2003 budget&#13;
sufficient resources to expand the coverage of the social safety net interventions and other&#13;
interventions that are aimed at drought mitigations.&#13;
24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
Drought Recovery Interventions&#13;
The interventions discussed below fulfill Government's policy considerations of responding to short,&#13;
medium and long-term requirements expected of the drought recovery program. Brief description, the&#13;
cost implications and the expectations from the World Bank are summarized below item-wise.&#13;
1. Emergency Food Supply.&#13;
Zambia estimated a total maize production of 601,000 metric tons during the 2001/02 agricultural&#13;
season, 51 percent below the last normal annual crop, thus giving a food deficit of about 635,000&#13;
metric tons. The Government assessed the specific food needs of the affected populations in the 38&#13;
districts through vulnerability assessment and mapping exercises undertaken jointly with the UN&#13;
agencies and the NGOs following the May 2002 crop forecast. The communities through their local&#13;
committees called the "satellite committees" were closely associated with the food assessment, and in&#13;
preparing the household need list which would be the basis for food distribution. Their food relief&#13;
needs are estimated at 224,000 metric tons and would cost about US$56 million.&#13;
Taking cognizance of this situation, the Government has arranged to secure food supplies through the&#13;
private sector, bilateral donor assistance, WFP, and through Government's own budgetary resources.&#13;
The private sector supplies are estimated at 300,000 metric tons and would take care of the market&#13;
demand in the urban and periurban areas where people would buy food. So far, food aid delivery has&#13;
been about 20,000 metric tons and another 20,000 metric tons is expected in the next few months,&#13;
bringing the total to 40,000 metric tons. The rest, about 260,000 has to be imported by government&#13;
through its own budgetary resources for food relief distribution and for emergency reserve.&#13;
Distribution Arrangement and Criteria for food relief: A number of ongoing programs of food relief&#13;
distribution as well as food for works and community self-help are being administered by various&#13;
Government agencies and implemented through NGOs and other agencies. The principal programs&#13;
are as follows:&#13;
(a) Targetedfood assistance: Disaster Mitigation and Management Unit (DMMU) and the WFP&#13;
implement these programs in the drought-affected areas mainly through the NGOs who&#13;
distribute the food assistance. DMMU has contracted 29 NGOs for food distribution, and&#13;
WFP has on contract 13 such NGOS (some being common). For targeted food assistance,&#13;
assessment surveys are conducted by the Government through close involvement of the&#13;
NGOs, community level satellite committees and the district disaster relief committees, and&#13;
then validated through an arrangement of scrutiny by a national joint team comprising of the&#13;
key Government ministries/agencies, the UN System such as the WFP, FAO and the&#13;
prominent NGOs. The available food aid is distributed to households based on a combination&#13;
of geographic targeting (districts where production shortfalls were highest) and indicator-&#13;
based targeting. Targeting criteria for households include: female headed households; child&#13;
headed households; disabled headed households; households supporting orphans; households&#13;
facing calamities including HIV/AIDS and households with less that one hectare of land. The&#13;
most vulnerable groups are placed on a separate list and provided with free food rations&#13;
(about 20 percent of the affected households generally qualify), and the remaining (80&#13;
percent) is on the list of food assistance provided generally through food-for-work. The food&#13;
distribution is done by the NGO in close collaboration with the satellite committee, and&#13;
periodically supervised/monitored by the district disaster relief Quite often the target-group&#13;
households outstrips the levels of available food aid, and the beneficiary households tend to&#13;
share the food with others in the community;&#13;
25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(b) Social assistance to incapacitated people: The Public Welfare Assistance Scheme (PWAS)&#13;
implemented by the Ministry of Community Development and Social Welfare (MCDSS) is&#13;
one of the oldest social programs in Zambia, which provides in-kind assistance (clothes, food,&#13;
educational requirements, etc) to non-able bodied poor such as widows, orphans, elderly and&#13;
disabled. Under recent reforms, the beneficiaries are selected by community public welfare&#13;
committees which consist of community representatives; the community committees are&#13;
linked to area- and district-level committees which also include NGO and district government&#13;
officers. Currently about 10 percent of the targeted population receives this assistance due to&#13;
budgetary limitations.&#13;
(c) Food-for-Assets, Cash-for-Works and Food-for-Works: These programs are carried out by a&#13;
number of NGOs and public agencies e.g. the Program for Urban Self-Help (PUSH), CARE&#13;
International food for work program--rehabilitation of community productive assets, ZAMSIF&#13;
Community Transport Infrastructure program under ROADSIP. The scale of labor-intensive&#13;
works undertaken by these programs is still low and hence even in aggregate they do not add&#13;
up to a safety net with significant coverage now. However, there is sufficient under-utilized&#13;
technical capacity in these institutions, which can be mobilized to expand these works to&#13;
provide significantly more supplemental cash-income opportunities for unskilled workers in&#13;
drought-affected areas. During this drought, Government would emphasize that the&#13;
implementers increase the labor content of the schemes to provide relief to a maximum&#13;
number of the affected people.&#13;
Logistics of Food Transportation: Of the estimated food deficit of about 635,000mt, roughly 174,000&#13;
metric tons. is relief food being distributed principally by WFP and needing to be moved to affected&#13;
population of 2.9 million in 38 districts- some 60 percent in the Southern Province, 38 percent in&#13;
Western, 37 percent in Eastern and 31 percent in Central provinces. Compared to food relief,&#13;
agricultural inputs and other materials are small in volume. WFP estimates that between 17 to 25,000&#13;
metric tons. of food will need to be distributed monthly over the period September 2002 and March,&#13;
2003: its present monthly distribution is about 7,000 metric tons. Delivery from the nearest external&#13;
source of food import, Republic of South Africa, takes between four to six weeks by rail. The&#13;
government and WFP engage the services of NGOs in the affected areas to distribute relief food. No&#13;
major logistics problems are faced in getting food down to district headquarters, the major logistics&#13;
problems being at the district level where poor rural road network and transport services require that&#13;
special, non commercial arrangements be made to supplement available transport services. About a&#13;
third of the total cost of food relief operations is attributable to their transportation from source of&#13;
procurement to place of consumption.&#13;
The government' basic strategy in dealing with the task of moving relief materials to the people in the&#13;
affected 38 districts is to ensure good coordination of the activities of all stakeholders involved in the&#13;
ordering, shipment, certification, customs processing, storage and distribution of relief materials. By&#13;
so doing, it aims to avoid the bunching of the arrival of relief materials, minimize double handling,&#13;
reduce storage, and transport costs. The government also intends to take steps to improve the systems&#13;
in place for tracking internal movement of relief materials thus ensuring their safe and timely&#13;
distribution to beneficiaries. Steps will also be taken to ensure that institutional barriers are removed&#13;
to allow full utilization of logistical resources available within the country.&#13;
To address logistics problems at the district level, the government intends to (a) make improvements&#13;
to the rural road network in key locations in the 38 affected districts through food/cash for works&#13;
programs; (b) repair and rehabilitate some presently unserviceable pontoons; (c) install bailey bridges&#13;
at critical river crossings; and (d) repair and rehabilitate some tractors and procure ten new ones. The&#13;
government is also taking steps to ensure that needed bridge strengthening is carried out at key&#13;
locations and that the rail tracks/beds of the Zambian Railways and TAZARA are strengthened at&#13;
known weak points before the onset of the rainy season. The government will also engage in dialogue&#13;
with its partners to ensure that equipment available to them are made generally accessible for use in&#13;
facilitating the movement of relief materials.&#13;
26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Bank support will be required mainly for:&#13;
(a) Logistics improvement including (i) the proposed improvements to the rural road network&#13;
(the cost of this is provided for under the planned Public Works Program); (ii) repair and&#13;
rehabilitation of pontoons at a cost of US$600,000 (cost of spares and equipment); (iii)&#13;
installation of bailey bridges at about US$720,000 (civil works expenditures); (iv)&#13;
rehabilitation of four weak bridges (US$400,000); (v) repair and rehabilitation of tractors and&#13;
procurement of ten new tractors at a cost of US$ 240,000; (vi) strengthening the most&#13;
vulnerable section of the rail tracks of the Zambian railways and wagon refurbishment at an&#13;
estimated cost of US$850,000; and&#13;
(b) Meeting transportation and distribution costs of Government food imports estimated at&#13;
US$2.5 million.&#13;
Distribution Arrangements. The DMMU currently performs this function and has a key role in&#13;
demand as well as supply side of this operation. With the assistance of the district disaster relief&#13;
committees and the community -level relief committees called satellite committees the DMMU&#13;
conducts the household food survey and compiles the household food requirements aggregated to&#13;
district, regional, and national level, and these form the basis of food supply planning, procurement&#13;
and distribution. For food distribution to the beneficiaries the DMMU has entered into MoUs with 29&#13;
international/national NGOs who distribute food to the listed beneficiaries in close collaboration with&#13;
the satellite committees, and under the overall supervision of the district relief committees. DMMU&#13;
carries out its oversight responsibilities for the proper food distribution through supervisory visits and&#13;
periodical meetings with the district agencies. DMMU has three regional offices that assist in the&#13;
performance of its field activities, provincial/district coordination, supervision, and investigation of&#13;
complaints and grievances.&#13;
2. Water Sanitation and Environment&#13;
The water scarcity in several parts of the affected districts is quite severe, and is particularly acute in&#13;
the 11 districts of the Southern province. The Government strategy to meet the situation is to&#13;
rehabilitate the existing drinking water sources in the most affected areas, and to create new water&#13;
points through a borehole-drilling program where the existing sources cannot be revived. For this the&#13;
drilling capacity of the Department of Water Affairs would be augmented by rehabilitating the&#13;
existing fleet of drilling rigs, purchase drilling bits and other materials for carrying out the drilling&#13;
program, and purchase three more rigs to replace the rigs declared completely unserviceable. In order&#13;
to expedite the construction/rehabilitation of water points the Government would press into service&#13;
the available drillers in the private sector as well. The planned emergency program is expected to be&#13;
completed in less than six months.&#13;
The Government has taken steps to expedite the construction/rehabilitation of bore holes under donor&#13;
supported programs especially under (i) the German-aided project operating in the eastern province;&#13;
(ii) Japanese aided project in 6 districts of the Central province; (iii) boreholes in Gwembe district&#13;
sponsored by SDA Church and the ZESCO; and (iv) drilling of about 100 boreholes under the&#13;
UNICEF assisted program. Some initiatives under programs implemented by the ZAMSIF and RIF&#13;
projects, and programs implemented by NGOs such as the World Vision International, Care&#13;
International, Oxfam, Zambia Red Cross and the Gosnen Mission are also adding water capacity in&#13;
certain affected communities. However, due to the severity of the situation the Govermment needs to&#13;
do more to cover the remaining sizeable number of seriously affected communities. For this the&#13;
Government proposes the following program for World Bank assistance mainly to provide rigs and&#13;
other equipment to undertake a drilling program to fulfill the remaining high priority unmet needs. A&#13;
tentative list has been prepared of these sites, which would be updated and validated through the&#13;
district and satellite committees before the drilling operation is undertaken.&#13;
The key elements of this plan are as follows: (a) Spares and equipment for rehabilitation of 13&#13;
existing rigs of the Department of Water Development (US$700,000); (b) purchase of three new&#13;
27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
rotary rigs with accessories and spares (US$2.34 million); (c) material, spares, fuel and lubricants and&#13;
other consumables for (i) rehabilitation of 462 boreholes in the affected districts (per list); (ii)&#13;
purchase of 100 pumps for the existing boreholes; and (iii) construction of 250 new boreholes in the&#13;
most affected areas (per list), all at an estimated cost of US$1.35 million; (d) purchase of four water&#13;
bowsers (US$ 290,000); (e) support for community maintenance program WASHE operated by the&#13;
district councils (US$20,000), and provision of 5 computers and printers for the 5 provincial program&#13;
coordinating offices in the affected provinces, and a computer and printer for the headquarters office&#13;
(US$15,000); and (f) supplemental provision for carrying out hydrological surveys and regular water&#13;
table level monitoring particularly in the most severely affected Southern province (US$ 10,000) .&#13;
Implementation Arrangements: As described in component description some donor -assisted&#13;
programs are being implemented in a few of the affected districts, and the implementing agencies are&#13;
mainly the contracted NGOs who are utilizing the services of the private drillers for making and&#13;
rehabilitating the boreholes. The Department of Water Affairs under the Ministry of Energy and&#13;
Water Affairs would carry out the proposed program under the DRMP of drilling new boreholes and&#13;
rehabilitation. The department also proposes to utilize available private drilling capacity to expedite&#13;
implementation, and approved procurement procedures would be applied to hire private drillers. This&#13;
department under approved procurement procedures would manage the procurement of the new rigs&#13;
and other equipment, spares and machinery. The rehabilitation of the rigs would be carried out at the&#13;
departmental workshops&#13;
The World Bank is requested to finance the costs of equipment, materials, spares, fuel and other&#13;
consumable described above in the total value of US$4,435,000. The Government is committed to&#13;
provide budget support by way of counter part funds for undertaking the drilling program, and&#13;
securing its completion in the time frame indicated above.&#13;
3. Public Works Program:&#13;
The main objective of the public works program supported under the proposed project would be to&#13;
alleviate the impact of drought on vulnerable populations and improve their livelihoods by providing&#13;
in-kind (food and/or inputs) or in- cash assistance to enable them to secure food and other essential&#13;
goods and services. The program would lead to the improvement of rural infrastructure and thus&#13;
assist agricultural production by improving access of the rural communities to markets for essential&#13;
goods and services. The works to be executed would be labor-intensive in order to benefit the largest&#13;
number of affected people, and would engage unskilled labors from the nearby communities. Two&#13;
types of public works would be undertaken:&#13;
Road repair, improvement and maintenance: In order to provide work to communities within a&#13;
reasonable distance from their residence, it is proposed to identify 350 such works in the 38 districts,&#13;
priority being given to the most affected areas. Each roadwork would cost about US$20,000 and&#13;
improve about 5 kilometers of road sections, culverts, small bridges, and related drainage structures;&#13;
the road sections need not be along the same road link. The total cost of the work program would be&#13;
about US$7 million, and this investment will improve nearly 1,750 Km of road network. The location&#13;
of the proposed work in a severe drought area, its priority for the community and the district council&#13;
in terms of improving access, and livelihoods of the surrounding populations would be the main&#13;
criteria applied for identifying the proposed works. The other normative criteria for the selected&#13;
works would include the following: (i) labor content should not be less than 60 percent of the total&#13;
cost of work, overheads no more than 10 percent, and tools and other operating costs no more than 30&#13;
percent; (ii) women should comprise at least 60 percent of the labor force engaged; (iii) program wage&#13;
rates would be set at ZK5,000 per day; (iv) labor input in a workday would be limited to about 4 hours&#13;
per task; and (v) child care facilities would be provided with elderly women and physically&#13;
weak/infirm persons earning their wages by looking after the children.&#13;
Other Civil works: Some other local civil works of utility would also be covered under this program in&#13;
order to provide temporary employment for income supplementation to the affected population within&#13;
28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
or nearby their communities. These would include improvement of shallow drinking water wells;&#13;
construction of VIP latrines; repair/reconstruction of the dip tanks and such other works of&#13;
community use. These works would be identified by the various implementation agencies (including&#13;
the NGOs) in consultation with the communities. The district council would be consulted and the&#13;
district disaster relief committee would approve the overall program in the district. The criteria for&#13;
selection of works described above would also be applicable to these works.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements: The nodal agency for public works implementation would be the&#13;
National Roads Board (NRB) which would be responsible for coordinating overall implementation by&#13;
the designated implementing agencies, supervision, quality assurance, monitoring and reporting. At&#13;
the technical level the public works program would be guided by a Steering Committee chaired by the&#13;
DMMU with membership extending to the Ministry of Communications and Transport (MCT), NRB,&#13;
Ministry of Local Government and Housing (MLGH), Department of Roads of the Ministry of Works&#13;
and Supply, and representatives .of the implementing agencies. NRB would provide the secretariat for&#13;
this committee. The NRB would receive funding under the project from the DMMU and would&#13;
furnish to it periodical implementation progress reports, and the required financial statements of&#13;
accounts. Three implementing agencies have been identified to carry out these works in the field:&#13;
NRB/MLGH (through the provincial consultants and small scale labor-based contractors in liaison&#13;
with district councils who have engineering personnel to carry out works), PUSH and the ZAMSIF,&#13;
and more agencies may be added in future.&#13;
Assistance sought from the World Bank for the road works program is US$ 7 million from the&#13;
proposed EDRP. However, the works programs implemented by the ZAMSIF through its&#13;
implementing mechanisms would be funded by the ZAMSIF under its social fund, and sum of about&#13;
US$12 million is expected to be utilized for this purpose.&#13;
4. Emergency School Feeding Program&#13;
The objective of this program is to keep the children, particularly the girls, at school to prevent&#13;
interruption of studies in this time of stress, and to encourage dropouts to rejoin the school. The&#13;
program would support two main activities: (i) a daily high energy protein supplement (HEPS) to be&#13;
distributed to all the children attending the targeted schools; and (ii) a monthly targeted take-home&#13;
ration supplement to children offamilies on the free-food distribution list conditional on continued&#13;
school attendance by the child. The program would be implemented in targeted schools identified by&#13;
the Ministry of Education in 18 most seriously affected districts in the Southem, Eastem, and Westem&#13;
provinces (list attached).&#13;
Implementation Arrangements: The Ministry of Education would chair a task force comprising of the&#13;
representatives from the DMMU, WFP, UNICEF, WB, others concerned who would within two&#13;
weeks finalize the (i) composition of the HEPS ration in accordance with the WFP/UNESCO/WHO&#13;
guidelines on nutritious rations; and the scale of ration per child; (ii) arrangements for ration&#13;
production (in case the option settles on energy biscuits or similar manufactured foods); and set in&#13;
motion arrangements for contracting the manufacturer(s) under accepted procurement guidelines, or&#13;
decide on the ration ingredients to be procured in the market for actual preparation of preferred food&#13;
in the targeted schools(in terms of feasibility in the Zambian conditions, and with due regard to local&#13;
traditions and customs and preferences); and (iii) nominate a lead implementing agency such as the&#13;
WFP with responsibility for procurement of food items, distribution, oversight and reporting.. This&#13;
committee will also finalize arrangements for training of the district education staff and&#13;
schoolteachers entrusted with the task in the designated schools. The lead implementer and the&#13;
designated NGOs in monitoring the program would associate the District Disaster Relief Committees.&#13;
Coverage and Costs: The scheme would provide coverage to an estimated 200,000 children in 18&#13;
districts. At about 880 kwacha per child per day for 20 days of monthly schooling, the cost of these&#13;
rations in the 6-month period would be about US$5 million, which includes the costs of&#13;
transportation, distribution and administration. The funding for this program would be provided&#13;
29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
under the ongoing BESSIP by appropriate inter-category re-allocation. Funding for the monthly&#13;
rations to the eligible children under the second component of this program would be secured from&#13;
another donor.&#13;
5. School Bursaries&#13;
This ongoing program would be expanded to cover about 50 percent of the affected pupils at the&#13;
primary school level in the targeted schools in the 18 affected districts. The program to be&#13;
implemented by the Public Welfare Assistance Scheme (PWAS), Ministry of Community&#13;
Development. The BESSIP bursary scheme is not expected to encounter significant problems in&#13;
expanding the scheme rapidly to cover many more primary school children this year as the&#13;
mechanism is already in place, and PWAS has completed its sensitization exercises in these districts.&#13;
The program would cost about US$1.5 million and would be funded under the ongoing IDA -&#13;
supported credit BESSIP, through appropriate re-allocation amongst categories, as necessary.&#13;
6. Targeted input distribution&#13;
The Government proposes to scale up the implementation of the ongoing Food Security Pack (FSP)&#13;
scheme to cover all the 38 drought affected districts. This is a program in which the Ministry of&#13;
Community Development and Social services (MCDSS) and the Ministry of Agriculture (MAC)&#13;
collaborate, and implementation is normally assigned to NGOs. The main technological component&#13;
of the program consists in supplying diversified seed and planting material to identified small farmers&#13;
and promotes conservation farming techniques. The seed and fertilizer materials are delivered in a&#13;
pack sufficient to support production on three fourth of a hectare. In the 2002/03 cropping season the&#13;
government has planned to target 200,000 small farmers. The total costs of inputs including&#13;
transportation and distribution costs is estimated at US$7 million, which would be sought under the&#13;
proposed EDRP. The program is expected to generate about 150,000 metric tons of food including&#13;
cereals and enhance food security of the targeted farmers.&#13;
7. Matching Grant Program&#13;
The government has identified a 120,000 small farmers who are members of the farmer cooperatives&#13;
and groups in the seriously drought affected districts to assist them in raising the next season crop. A&#13;
sum US$12 million has been budgeted by the Government for program and the beneficiary farmers&#13;
will provide a matching contribution ofUS$10million. An estimated 48,000 metric tons of fertilizer&#13;
and 2,400 metric tons of seed will be procured direct from local suppliers. The inputs are intended to&#13;
be supplied at 50 percent direct subsidy. The program will result in an incremental production of&#13;
approximately 360,000 metric tons of maize. All benefiting smallholder farmers will access their&#13;
inputs from their registered farmers organizations or cooperatives. A minimum package of assistance&#13;
to the smallholder farmers will be maize seed and fertilizer inputs sufficient for planting one hectare.&#13;
The Government extension services will support the program. Beneficiary farmer organizations,&#13;
cooperatives or farmer groups will be selected by a board comprising district agriculturai committees&#13;
(DACs), the local NGOs, the church and local leadership. The program will run for three years and&#13;
will be implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives.&#13;
8. Human Health&#13;
Due to drought conditions water sources have dried up in several areas and water scarcity is severe&#13;
affecting quality and quantity of water and general sanitation. The Ministry of Health anticipates a&#13;
considerable risk of the outbreak epidemics such as cholera, diarrhea, dysentery and other&#13;
communicable diseases like measles. To safeguard public health and control the spread of epidemics&#13;
the Government would procure/import necessary drugs and medical supplies at an estimated cost of&#13;
US$50,000 under the proposed EDRP, These would be distributed to the affected districts and stored&#13;
in key health centers to be readily available in the time of emergency.&#13;
30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9. Animal Disease Control&#13;
The government proposes an emergency animal disease control program targeted mostly at diseases&#13;
of an epidemic nature. They all affect the productivity of livestock either through direct losses caused&#13;
by mortality and decreased production or indirect losses resulting from effects on trade, draught&#13;
power, manure etc. The major diseases covered in this proposal are contagious Bovine&#13;
Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), theileriosis (East Coast Fever) (ECF),&#13;
tsetse transmitted trypanosomosis, anthrax and rabies.&#13;
The program involves the importation of 950,000 doses of CBPP, 100,000 doses of ECF, 290,000&#13;
doses of FMD, 280,000 doses of anthrax and 44,000 doses of rabies vaccines. In addition, veterinary&#13;
drugs chemicals and diagnostic reagents will be imported to treat an estimated 265,000 cattle and kits&#13;
to treat 70,000 cases of rabies. The estimated cost of these vaccines is US$921,100 while the drugs&#13;
will cost US$509,800. Veterinary equipment will cost an additional US$47,500. Operational cost to&#13;
run this program will be US$610,000. The total cost of these imports would amount to&#13;
US$2,088,400. All vaccines, drugs and equipment will could acquired through the positive list of&#13;
imports under the project and the operating cost through special allocation under EDRP.&#13;
The program would assist in the following outputs: 25,000 cattle will be treated for ECF;&#13;
100,000cattle will be vaccinated against ECF; 950,000 cattle will be vaccinated against CBPP;&#13;
290,000cattle will be vaccinated against FMD; 280,000 cattle will be vaccinated against Anthrax and&#13;
40,000 people at risk will be protected. Livestock mortalities caused by corridor/theileriosis or ECF&#13;
and CBPP will be reduced by over 70 percent.&#13;
Implementation of these activities will be carried out by the field staff of MAC under the supervision&#13;
of the Deputy Director and assisted by the Chief Veterinary Officer in the Department of Research&#13;
and Specialist Services in the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. The Technical Advisory&#13;
Group will provide technical assistance to ensure efficiency and effective coverage.&#13;
10. Capacity Building Initiatives&#13;
Recognizing the deficiencies in the current arrangement the Govemment is committed to build up&#13;
appropriate capacity for disaster early waming, planning comprehensive mitigation measures, and&#13;
timely and efficient implementation of the mitigation plans. The following proposals are proposed,&#13;
which are underpinned by considerations of addressing the immediate and short- term requirements of&#13;
the current severe drought on the one hand, and for commencing actions and activities which would&#13;
assist in building capacity in the long term.&#13;
Early Warning&#13;
Strengthening the Zambia Meteorology Department: This organization is using old and archaic&#13;
instruments of 1950/60s vintage, nearly 13 district do not have appropriate rain gauges and other&#13;
instruments, institution's capacity for data analysis and forecasting is weak, and because of resource&#13;
constraints this vital organ at the forefront of the early warning chain has not been able to perform its&#13;
tasks satisfactorily, marginalizing the effort downstream as well. Action is proposed on two fronts:&#13;
(a) to provide technical assistance for a professional study to recommend the upgrading of the weather&#13;
monitoring and forecasting system which would include proposals for organizational strengthening,&#13;
appropriate job descriptions, weather data analysis methodologies and forecasting systems, and&#13;
recommendations for human resource development (US$30,000 comprising of US$15,000 for&#13;
consultant study and equal amount for training); (b) meeting the immediate equipment requirements&#13;
of the meteorology office at a cost of US$731,700. Detailed list of the equipment would be provided.&#13;
Streamlining the Organizational/institutional Arrangements for Early Warning in the Government: A&#13;
study is proposed to streamline the system by situation analysis of the roles and responsibilities of the&#13;
key Government agencies involved in early warning, their current location, study options for&#13;
31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
organizational re-location for optimum utility and effectiveness, and re-structuring of the key&#13;
institutions/organizations as warranted consistent with effectiveness, efficiency and economy, and to&#13;
provide specific recommendations for human resource development (US$ 10,000). A sum of&#13;
US$ 10,000 would be provided for training of the key personnel in these organizations in terms of the&#13;
study recommendations.&#13;
Strengthening the DMMU&#13;
The Government has considered proposals to appropriately strengthen DMMU capacity to effectively&#13;
address disaster management in the long term. However, the present severe drought and the proposed&#13;
donor supported assistance package have considerably increased the range and volume of activities&#13;
for which the DMMU is not fully equipped. The addition of a large portfolio under the proposed&#13;
US$50 million World Bank credit would increase this burden further. It is therefore proposed to&#13;
strengthen the DMMU with the addition of a sub-section, which would handle the World Bank project&#13;
activities, and have the required specialists to assist DMMU to implement a time bound program of 24&#13;
months under a quick disbursing credit. The sub-section would be headed by an EDRP Coordinator,&#13;
and staffed by a procurement specialist, a financial officer and a logistics specialist with appropriate&#13;
support staff like a steno and a typist. The sub-section would work closely with the staff in the&#13;
Logistics, Operations and Management section of the DMMU as members of a team. The EDRP&#13;
coordinator in respect of all matters concerning the EDRP would report directly to the head of the&#13;
DMMU namely the National Coordinator (NC). In other matters, he would report to the NC through&#13;
the Head of the logistic, operations and management section. The DMMU in consultation with the&#13;
Permanent Secretary of the Office of the Vice President would describe the job description of each of&#13;
the new positions. One of the key responsibilities of the professional staff in the sub-section would be&#13;
to provide training to the local Government staff as a part of the capacity building objective. An&#13;
additional responsibility of the logistics specialist would be to design an appropriate logistics&#13;
management system. All the positions would be for the duration of two years, except that the logistics&#13;
specialist would be recruited for 12 months.&#13;
The Government would also establish a new regional office of the DMMU in the Western province,&#13;
as the regional office now in charge of the two most seriously affected Southern and Western&#13;
provinces is overburdened. This would need the creation of the positions of a regional coordinator, a&#13;
typist, a messenger and a driver.&#13;
All the new professional positions would be filled on the basis of competitive recruitment from the&#13;
market at competitive remuneration packages, and would be funded under the World Bank credit.&#13;
The Government may, however, exclude the new regional office positions from this dispensation, and&#13;
fill them from the civil service cadre, in case this can be accomplished expeditiously i.e. within 4 to 6&#13;
weeks. The estimated cost of these positions over a two-year period would be approximately&#13;
US$195,000. Provision would also be made for improving the monitoring and evaluation capacity,&#13;
and support for strengthening the MIS (US$10,000). Other related expenditures would be as follows:&#13;
(i) three 4WD vehicles (US$75,000); (ii) furniture and equipment, 5 computers, two printers&#13;
(US$25,000); (iii) office supplies, vehicle operating costs and other operating costs for 2 years&#13;
(US$45,000); and (iv) training of the DMMU personnel in terms of the human resource development&#13;
plan (US$25,000). A copy of the training plan would be provided.&#13;
The Government would make available to the DMMU a procurement assistant against the existing&#13;
vacant position. In addition, the Government would also provide to the DMMU a qualified&#13;
accountant (proposal already pending with the Ministry of Finance) and fill this position expeditiously&#13;
from cadre of accountants through the Accountant General.&#13;
DMMU will establish an Emergency Operations Response Center (EOC), which would operate&#13;
during emergencies and would be manned round the clock. The existing DMMU personnel would be&#13;
redeployed for duties in the EOC during the emergency. The Government would obtain technical&#13;
assistance from a similar center operating in the Republic of South Africa or from any other&#13;
32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
neighboring country to suggest the design and structure of the proposed EOC and its operating&#13;
procedures; and to make specific recommendations for upgrading the communication system along&#13;
with a list of hardware to be procured for the purpose. The estimated cost of this capacity building&#13;
measure is estimated at US$50,000, which includes US$10,000 as consultancy cost, and the&#13;
remaining sum for equipment, hardware and software in terms of the consultant recommendations.&#13;
The Government requests technical assistance for the following key activities/studies which would&#13;
help achieve the policy and operational sustainability objectives of the disaster mitigation and&#13;
management initiatives of the Government: (i) to review and finalize the Government's disaster&#13;
mitigation and management policy; (ii) consistent with the national policy on disaster, and the&#13;
provisions of the proposed disaster management bill to prepare a detailed drought and famine code to&#13;
provide guidelines for step by step implementation to all the actors involved in these activities at the&#13;
community, district and national levels; (iii) to establish an appropriate data collection, analysis and&#13;
dissemination system and an MIS together with recommendations for institutional strengthening and&#13;
capacity building in this regard, and hard/soft ware requirements to operate the system. The estimated&#13;
costs of these studies would be about US$40,000.&#13;
Capacity-Buildingfor Monitoring, Evaluation and Coordination of Safety Nets&#13;
It is proposed that resources be provided to carry out studies to assist (i) MCDSS to redefine its role&#13;
and responsibilities in respect of the nation-wide safety net interventions, review capacity of the&#13;
ministry and all other agencies responsible for implementation on the ground, and suggest an&#13;
appropriate structure and operating procedures to enhance focus on and effective implementation of&#13;
the social safety net initiatives;(ii) enhance monitoring, evaluation functions of the MCDSS&#13;
Department of Planning and provide an effective MIS; and (iii) prepare a long term social protection&#13;
strategy. The funding would be shared among the EDRP and existing IDA credits such as the&#13;
ZAMSIF and PSCAP. It is estimated that funding support required for these activities would be&#13;
US$300,000 out of which US$200,000 is proposed to be funded under the EDRP, a possible&#13;
US$50,000 under PSCAP and a possible US$47,000 under ZAMSIF (proposals are being processed).&#13;
33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment II&#13;
Arrangement for the Implementation of the Plan&#13;
The Government has in place institutional arrangements for disaster planning and management, and a&#13;
structured oversight mechanism including for policy, program review and co-ordination. The Office&#13;
of the Vice President has the overall responsibility for disaster management, and a department of this&#13;
Office headed by a director - Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU)- is the nodal&#13;
agency for planning and coordinating disaster management. At the apex is a Cabinet Committee&#13;
chaired by the Vice President and called the National Disaster and Relief Committee (NDRC).&#13;
NDRC is served by a Technical Committee, which comprises of the permanent secretaries of the&#13;
concerned ministries. The technical committee is supported by a subordinate committee of technical&#13;
specialists who finalize the proposals for submission to the above higher-level committees. Because&#13;
of consultations with the UN system and other stakeholders, the Government has decided to establish&#13;
a Joint Steering Committee (JSC) comprising of the key government ministries/agencies, the&#13;
concerned UN agencies, key NGOs with major implementation responsibility, and selected private&#13;
sector organizations. This commnittee would be chaired by the Permanent Secretary in the Office of&#13;
the Vice President, with DMMU acting as its secretariat. The JSC would act as an effective forum for&#13;
information sharing, periodic consultation, coordination, and oversight of the disaster mitigation&#13;
program, and make recommendations to the NDRC.&#13;
In addition, there are a number of specialized subconmnittees (tender, finance, infrastructure, health,&#13;
relief, water and sanitation, transport, and communication) through which the subject matter-specific&#13;
proposals, which require inputs by other ministries/agencies, are processed. The membership of the&#13;
sub-committees is wider and besides the concerned ministries, it carries representation of the&#13;
concerned UN agencies, NGOs, private sector bodies with a role in the particular topic of disaster&#13;
management. The DMMU provides secretariat back up to the above committees, but the sub-&#13;
committees are chaired by the lead ministry who provide the secretarial assistance as well.&#13;
In the field, implementation of the disaster relief program is overseen at the provincial level by the&#13;
Provincial Disaster Management Committee and, at the district level, by the District Disaster&#13;
Management Committee. Prominent NGOs, other local stakeholder institutions and private sector are&#13;
represented on these committees. This participatory and representative character of the institutional&#13;
arrangement for drought mitigation and management continues down to the community level where&#13;
'satellite committees' comprising of the community elders and other community representatives&#13;
participate in drought mitigation planning and management activities such as household surveys,&#13;
preparing beneficiary lists, determining household food gap and relief food entitlement, and oversight&#13;
of food and other relief distribution by the field implementing agencies (generally the NGOs). The&#13;
DMMU and the Word Food Program, who share tasks related to the relief food distribution, engage&#13;
NGOs to distribute food in the districts/areas respectively assigned to each, and to manage the food-&#13;
for-work programs approved for the area. Through these mechanisms, the Government has been able&#13;
to establish on the ground a fairly transparent and accountable arrangement for program&#13;
administration, which is considered satisfactory for implementing the initiatives supported by the&#13;
proposed EDRP.&#13;
Although the DMMU would be the nodal agency for the overall coordination and management, the&#13;
various interventions under the Drought Mitigation Plan would be executed by a number of&#13;
Ministries/agencies besides the DMMU. Component/sub-component specific implementation&#13;
arrangements are described under the respective component description.&#13;

Annex 2: Macroeconomic Impact of Current Food Crisis&#13;
Food balance sheet&#13;
Zambia faces a serious food shortage in 2002/03 owing to unusually low rainfall during the previous&#13;
production season. The 2001/2002 production season was characterized by scarce rains in the&#13;
southern half of the country and somewhat normal rains in the northern half. Consequently, crop&#13;
production was negatively affected. In Southern Province, the dry spells resulted in insufficient&#13;
moisture to support crop development, thereby severely affecting crop production. Similarly, in the&#13;
northern province, severe floods experienced in February 2002 swept away most of the mature&#13;
cassava crop grown in the plains of some parts of the province.&#13;
While the total national food requirement is estimated at 1,476,000 metric tons, domestic production&#13;
is estimated at only 765,000 metric tons. This represents an overall food deficit of 433,000 metric&#13;
tons. For maize only, the deficit is 635,000 metric tons, the largest maize deficit experienced in recent&#13;
years. Other cereal crops sorghum/millet, rice and wheat recorded huge deficits.&#13;

Currently, a total of 38 districts in seven provinces are in need of food relief. The government's plan&#13;
is to provide at least 200,000 metric tons of relief food to these areas. In addition, commercial&#13;
imports are expected to be in the range of 300,000 metric tons. In financial terms, it is estimated that&#13;
a total of US$160 million is required to tackle the problem of food shortages and to finance programs&#13;
aimed at supporting farmers experiencing food shortages.&#13;
Macroeconomic impact&#13;
The food shortage will have some short-term economic consequences, which can be managed&#13;
provided that sufficient external support is forthcoming to help finance the emergency recovery effort.&#13;
Early indications are that the food crisis will have adverse impact on GDP growth, exchange rate,&#13;
inflation, government budget, and balance of payments position.&#13;
36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
GDP growth. The food crisis has adversely affected agricultural growth, and through the latter, the&#13;
overall growth of the economy. Compared to the previous production season, production of maize&#13;
declined by 24.5 percent from 803,000 metric tons of maize to 606,000 metric tons (in 2001/2002).&#13;
Production of maize, millet/sorghum, rice and wheat fell in the 2001/2002 agricultural season&#13;
compared to the previous season. The decline in cassava output was largely due to the severe floods&#13;
experienced in February 2002 in Northern and Luapula provinces, which swept away most of the&#13;
mature cassava. As a result of these drops in crop output, value added in the agricultural sector is&#13;
projected to drop by 3.9 percent compared to original projected growth of 2.0 percent in 2002. The&#13;
decline in value added in the agricultural sector has adversely affected the growth of real GDP.&#13;
Preliminary data compiled by the Central Statistics Office indicate that real GDP will grow by 3.7&#13;
percent in 2002 compared to a targeted growth of at least 4.3 percent.&#13;
Exchange rate. Between end of December 2001 and the end of June 2002, the Bank of Zambia mid-&#13;
exchange rate depreciated by 14 percent. Similarly, the commercial bank's selling rates depreciated&#13;
by 14.7 percent. This contrasts significantly with the results for the same period in 2001 when the&#13;
Bank of Zambia mid-exchange rate appreciated by 12 percent and the commercial banks' selling rates&#13;
by 13.6 percent. The depreciation in the exchange rate during 2002 has mainly been attributed to&#13;
market speculation following the announced pull-out by Anglo-American Plc from Konkola Copper&#13;
Mines, and reduced supply of foreign currency on the market that was due to depressed metal prices.&#13;
However, in recent months the currency has come under even greater pressure because of the&#13;
increased demand emanating from the need to finance maize and crude oil imports.&#13;
Inflation. In July 2002, the twelve-month inflation rose to 23.4 percent from 18.7 percent recorded as&#13;
at end-December 2001. This was 6.3 percentage points higher than that recorded as at end-July 2001.&#13;
Similarly, the year-to-date inflation rose to 11.4 percent, 4.3 percentage points higher than that&#13;
recorded during the same period in 2001. At the current trend, the 12-month inflation as at end-&#13;
December 2002 is estimated at 17.0 percent, which is 4.0 percentage points above the inflation target&#13;
of 13 percent agreed with the IMF. The rise in inflation is mainly attributed to the rising food prices&#13;
caused by low availability of food items, as well as the sharp depreciation of the kwacha.&#13;
Central government budget. Government did not provide for food imports in the 2002 budget, as no&#13;
drought was anticipated. As the food shortfall developed, however, government has increasingly&#13;
become involved in procuring maize. Of the estimated maize shortfall of 634,000 metric tons,&#13;
govermnent's direct involvement will be to ensure that 300,000 metric tons is procured. At the&#13;
current average market price per ton (for maize) of US$250, government's total bill will amount to&#13;
about US$72.0 million. Of this, a tentative agreement with the IMF allows for the government to&#13;
spend up to US$18 million towards food imports through issuance of treasury bills. Given that the&#13;
government has officially rejected donations of genetically-modified maize, and that the prospects for&#13;
donations of non-genetically-modified maize is very limited, the government will need to secure&#13;
US$55 million of external financial resources to meet food needs.1" Unless the govemment secures&#13;
such financing from external sources, the impact on 2003 budget deficit will be significant.&#13;
Balance ofpayments. The current account deficit is projected to narrow from an estimated deficit of&#13;
20.2 percent of GDP in 2001 to 17.2 percent of GDP in 2002. This Projection is based on an increase&#13;
in export volumes of 3.5 percent and a decline of import volumes by 4.6 percent (due to an anticipated&#13;
reduced investments in the mining sector following the decision made by Anglo-America not to make&#13;
further investments in Konkola Copper Mines Plc). However, as a result of the drought, imports are&#13;
expected to increase by 6.4 percent, thus raising the original projected import bill from US$1,192&#13;
"1     During the July Consultative Group for Zambia, cooperating partners pledged to support Zambia's&#13;
food shortfall amounting to about US$18 million for 44,465 metric tones of food under the World Food&#13;
Program's emergency operations project. Following the CG meeting held in July donors made pledges for the&#13;
procurement of food. However, most of the pledges made at the CG towards the financing of food purchases&#13;
have not yet materialized.&#13;
37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
million to US$1,329 million in 2002. Higher projected imports imply increased net service payments.&#13;
Export earnings are expected to rise slightly due to higher export volumes. These expected&#13;
developments, coupled with flat net income and a decline in projected GDP growth imply that the&#13;
projected current account deficit will widen slightly from 17.2 percent to 17.5 percent of GDP.&#13;
38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3: Social Risks and Protection Mechanisms&#13;
Neither poverty nor drought are new to Zambia. Poverty levels have remained very high throughout&#13;
the last decade, with the 1998 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey reporting 73 percent of all&#13;
Zambians living below the poverty line and 58 percent of the population living in extreme poverty&#13;
with insufficient means to cover basic food requirements. The levels of extreme poverty in rural&#13;
Zambia (71 percent of the rural population) are reported to be almost double that of urban areas (36&#13;
percent). Given such high levels of poverty, it is not surprising that the poor are distributed&#13;
throughout the country in every province. Drought too is a recurrent feature in Zambia, with the&#13;
historic drought of 1991/92 being followed by a smaller but significant drought in 1995, localized&#13;
crop failures in the intervening years, and once again, a major drought which is the crisis at hand&#13;
today.&#13;
Recognizing the recurrent nature of droughts in Zambia and the devastating and long-term&#13;
consequences for very low-income households, the government has included in its drought mitigation&#13;
plan a program to improve social protection of the poorest households in the immediate short term as&#13;
well as in the medium to long term such that Zambia enhances its overall ability to respond in the&#13;
future to droughts and other major economic shocks.&#13;
Expected social impact of the drought&#13;
While the initial impact of the drought was evident in the grain production figures, households are&#13;
experiencing its impact primarily as a consumption shock with many dimensions. Livelihoods in&#13;
rural Zambia are highly dependent on agriculture. Many smallholder farmers produce crops for&#13;
subsistence only and, in the worst-affected regions, a large number of smallholder farmers have&#13;
experienced total crop failure. For those rural and urban poor who do not or cannot rely on own-&#13;
production alone to meet basic food needs, the escalating prices of maize has led to a severe economic&#13;
strain through the erosion of purchasing power. As an example, while the price of a 25 kilogram bag&#13;
of maize meal was about 13,500 kwacha in December 2001, the current price is about 35,000 kwacha.&#13;
Moreover, opportunities for the able-bodied poor to earn wages to supplement incomes and buy food&#13;
are also very limited.&#13;
Under these circumstances, households are forced to make short-term choices which can have&#13;
deleterious long-term consequences for them. Many of these choices involve shifting resources from&#13;
investments for long-term benefits (for example, sending children to school) towards meeting&#13;
immediate household needs (food). While accurate estimates are not available, there are numerous&#13;
reports by NGOs and community based organizations in Zambia that children are dropping out of&#13;
school at an accelerated pace because the poorest households can no longer afford to pay for the&#13;
indirect costs of education (pencils, exercise books, and the like) and because they need the children's&#13;
assistance in earning wages or searching for food. Many of these school drop-outs may never return&#13;
to school and face the disadvantages of low education throughout their lives.&#13;
Health, nutrition and water. In addition to slashing agricultural output, the drought has in the heavily&#13;
hit districts in both the Southern and Western Provinces significantly reduced the quantity of available&#13;
clean water. The combination of limited food and clean water may damage people's health,&#13;
especially of women and children. The United Nations reports that children nationwide suffer from&#13;
high malnutrition rates with 53 percent stunted, 24 percent underweight, and 5 percent wasting. In the&#13;
worst-affected provinces, malnutrition levels in children under age five has been rising during the past&#13;
four years, and acute malnutrition (due to short-term effects) is expected to increase severely because&#13;
of care practices, inadequate food intake, and poor environmental conditions. In August 2002, a study&#13;
showed that 4.4 percent of children under the age of 5 were acutely malnourished. In fact, the&#13;
Southern Province has recorded significant increases in chronic malnutrition for 1991-93 and for&#13;
1993-96. The two periods have been associated with droughts that have particularly affected&#13;
Southern Province. The drying up of shallow water wells and surface water in the worst-hit districts&#13;
39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
has increased the risk of diarrhea and other related illnesses and infections. NGOs report that many&#13;
people cannot afford to obtain medical care as they do not have money to pay for the services or&#13;
because they are spending their time obtaining food and cannot go to health facilities. Women suffer&#13;
the most because they give up the little food available for other members of the family.&#13;
HIV/AIDS. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has left many orphans and widows in Zambia. In 1998 there&#13;
were 950,000 orphans in Zambia, 14 percent of whom lived in Southem Province, the third largest&#13;
number of orphans after the Copperbelt and Lusaka provinces. When added together, Central,&#13;
Eastern, Southern and Westem Provinces account for over 40 percent of orphans in the country. The&#13;
direct impact of the crisis in these areas will adversely affect the ability of communities to care for&#13;
people with HIV/AIDS, orphans, widows and, indeed, all vulnerable groups who traditionally rely on&#13;
family and community social support networks in times of need. In addition, hunger will result in&#13;
further exposure of the vulnerable to HIV/AIDS-especially in urban and periurban areas-as they&#13;
have few options at their disposal and may be forced to engage in high-risk behavior to survive.&#13;
Education. The sharply reduced grain harvests and acute shortages of water due to the drought has&#13;
resulted in widespread hunger across the country, particularly in the districts of the Southern, Central&#13;
and Eastern Provinces. This hunger has contributed to absenteeism of children from schools. The&#13;
impact of the present drought is basically an acute worsening of an already low school attendance due&#13;
to the high poverty levels and growing incidence of HIV/AIDS. Even prior to the drought, the&#13;
national enrollment rate declined from 85 percent in 1996 to 77 percent in 2001 (Ministry of&#13;
Education, Situational Analysis). Enrollment in rural areas is far worse than the national averages,&#13;
with attendance in 2001 standing at only 61 percent of eligible children. The direct consequence of the&#13;
current shortage of food is that pupils not only go to school hungry but are also forced to do additional&#13;
household chores and livelihood activities, such as fetching water and looking for food or, in the case&#13;
of urban areas, working for food or going to beg for food and money in the streets instead of attending&#13;
school. There are reports that enrollment in the areas most affected by the drought is down again this&#13;
year from earlier years.&#13;
Productive household assets are being depleted. Livestock is one of the major productive assets that&#13;
small farmers, even the poor, aspire to own and retain. One of the impacts of the drought, however,&#13;
has been the loss of animals in the drought-affected areas due to the scarcity of water. Estimates are&#13;
lacking of the dimensions of the depletion, but for some of the poorer households they represent large&#13;
losses in savings. Such losses will further constrain the ability of these households to recover from&#13;
the drought and engage in productive activities subsequently. Furthermore, some households no&#13;
longer have seed stock for planting in the next agricultural season because they have had to eat them&#13;
as food, and no resources to purchase new inputs.&#13;
Traditional safety nets and mutual assistance is overstretched. While Zambia has in place a number&#13;
of publicly-financed safety net mechanisms, the poorest and the most vulnerable households cope&#13;
with crises by reducing consumption, working longer hours or at different tasks (for example,&#13;
working for wages as well as farming), and obtaining resources from members of the family,&#13;
community, church groups, or other affiliate. NGOs have been reporting for some time that there are&#13;
large numbers of households in rural and urban areas who eating one meal a day. Households&#13;
(usually women and children) have also been foraging for wild foods, including roots, leaves, and&#13;
fruits. In most cases, these wild foods are not sufficient to replace the caloric content of the major&#13;
cereals. The traditional mutual assistance and family networks are already grappling with the&#13;
unprecedented shock of the large number of orphans, and with the ongoing high levels of poverty that&#13;
exist even in years of normal agricultural output. The food shortages this year will increase the&#13;
number of people needing assistance, while at the same time reducing the capacity of families and&#13;
communities to cope. Traditional support mechanisms are still very important in reaching the most&#13;
vulnerable. Community and church-based structures through the satellite disaster committees actively&#13;
identify people who are particularly vulnerable and in need of scarce food aid. NGOs note that&#13;
community norms of sharing are alive and in use, whereby specifically targeted vulnerable people&#13;
who receive food aid will often share the food with others who are also in need but who did not&#13;
40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
receive the aid. As for wage labor opportunities for those who are able-bodied, reports from NGOs&#13;
(such as PUSH) implementing various food-for-work programs indicate that many more people are&#13;
seeking employment than there are jobs.&#13;
Needfor direct food assistance. Due to the widespread crop failures, lack of alternative sources of&#13;
income, and gaps in the formal and informal safety nets, the joint assessment of the Disaster&#13;
Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU), WFP, FAO, and NGOs carried out in July 2002 (released&#13;
on September 16, 2002) estimates that approximately 2.9 million people require direct food assistance&#13;
on a monthly basis through March 2003 when the next harvest is expected. This represents over a&#13;
quarter (27 percent) of the total population of Zambia. The WFP further estimates that of the people&#13;
needing direct food assistance, 829,000 (60 percent) are in Southern Province while 38 percent are in&#13;
Western, 37 percent are in Eastern, and 31 percent are in Central Provinces. Estimates by WFP show&#13;
that cumulative cereal requirements between September 2002 and March, 2003 will be at 224,200&#13;
metric tons.&#13;
Existing public safety nets and humanitarian assistance mechanisms&#13;
The government of Zambia and its partners, including NGOs, donors and the World Bank, are already&#13;
supporting several programs aimed at strengthening community-response mechanisms and at&#13;
providing social assistance to households identified as especially vulnerable. The programs are&#13;
grouped into two categories. The first is productivity-enhancing, intended to not only provide&#13;
income, but also to also to create or protect household or community assets. The second is&#13;
consumption-enhancing, the primary objective of which is solely to transfer resources to the&#13;
beneficiary. In brief, the major programs under implementation include the following.&#13;
Targeted input distribution. The government and donors are actively supporting a number of NGOs&#13;
which aim to distribute seeds and fertilizer to vulnerable but viable farmers and to promote&#13;
conservation farming practices in those natural regions where they are appropriate. The largest such&#13;
program is being implemented by the Program against Malnutrition which emerged from the efforts to&#13;
mitigate the impact of the 1991/92 drought.'2 The Program against Malnutrition and its partner NGOs&#13;
have been implementing the food security pack initiative. Under this initiative, farmers who are&#13;
cultivating less than one hectare of land receive a diversified supply of seeds and other inputs adapted&#13;
to the local economic and soil regeneration needs. Where appropriate, the distributing NGOs also&#13;
train farmers in conservation farming practices. In return, the farmers must establish a community&#13;
seed bank and contribute 10 percent of the total output of their farms to the seed bank which becomes&#13;
a revolving seed fund for farmers of the community. The Program against Malnutrition reports that in&#13;
past years the payments (in-kind and sometimes in cash) to the seed bank have been completed by 60-&#13;
80 percent of the beneficiaries of the Program against Malnutrition. In 2002 it was reported that&#13;
farmers using conservation farming techniques in areas that received low and erratic rainfall in the&#13;
Southern Province achieved positive yields whereas neighboring farmers who used conventional&#13;
farming techniques suffered total crop failure.6&#13;
For the coming agricultural season, the Program against Malnutrition had originally been promised 10&#13;
billion kwacha from the public budget to finance inputs for 60,000 beneficiaries. As the scale of the&#13;
present drought became clearer, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning has indicated a&#13;
willingness to finance inputs for 200,000 farmers. Donors active in agriculture (such as FAO,&#13;
12     The Program against Malnutrition was initially established in 1992 as a government program for&#13;
distributing relief food to vulnerable groups affected by the 1991/92 drought. It was later transformed to focus&#13;
more on drought rehabilitation and development oriented non-food relief such as seed distribution, fertilizer,&#13;
seed production and distribution, food processing, preservation and utilization, using government and donor&#13;
resources.&#13;
6      It should be noted, however, that conservation farming techniques are not a panacea to drought&#13;
conditions. They are not suitable in certain types of terrain and, moreover, cannot protect yields against a total&#13;
failure of rains when the primary source of moisture for the crop is rain.&#13;
41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
German Technical Cooperation (GTZ), the European Union, US Agency for International&#13;
Development, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation) will also provide significant direct&#13;
assistance to other NGOs such as CARE and World Vision International to distribute similar seed and&#13;
input packs and teach conservation farming practices. The combined coverage of these programs&#13;
(assuming 200,000 households through the Program against Malnutrition) is estimated to be in the&#13;
range of about 300,000 farm households for the 2002/03 season, about one-third of all small-scale&#13;
farmers in Zambia.&#13;
Food-for-assets, cash-for-works, andfood-for-works. NGOs and government agencies have been&#13;
implementing public works programs in rural and periurban areas over the last decade. However, the&#13;
scale of labor-intensive works undertaken by these programs is still very low. Thus, currently even in&#13;
aggregate they do not add up to a safety net with significant coverage. The Bank's assessment is,&#13;
however, that these programs can be significantly expanded to provide opportunities for unskilled&#13;
workers in drought affected areas (and elsewhere) to earn cash or food. Below are brief descriptions&#13;
of a few of the larger and established programs.&#13;
PROGRAM FOR URBAN SELF-HELP (PUSH) is being implemented in nine districts in 23 unplanned&#13;
settlement areas. The program receives funding from the Ministry of Community Development and&#13;
Social Services (MCDSS) and has an ongoing agreement with the World Food Program for the use of&#13;
food supplies as wages. It also receives occasional funding from larger NGOs, such as CARE&#13;
Intemational. The program is concentrated in Copperbelt, Lusaka, Central and Southern Provinces.&#13;
Over 60 percent of participants are women. Participants work an average of four hours per day on&#13;
infrastructure improvement projects such as road rehabilitation, pit latrines, water wells, community&#13;
development centers and other civil works in return for a food ration equivalent of 50,000 kwacha&#13;
every ten days. Participants also partake in training programs focusing on entrepreneurial skills,&#13;
functional-literacy, reproductive health, and other topics. The program has been in operation since the&#13;
early 1990s and has been rated as fairly successful in improving access to services by participants and&#13;
providing them with life skills. Its impact as an overall safety net has been small due to the small&#13;
number of households (currently 8,000 households per year) it is able to reach with available&#13;
resources. It employs seven full-time engineers, who can work to expand PUSH works.&#13;
CARE INTERNATIONAL is also a well-established NGO in Zambia. It primarily distributes emergency&#13;
food but also has been implementing drought recovery activities such as food-for-work programs.&#13;
These works include rehabilitation of community productive assets such as feeder roads, canals, milk&#13;
collection centers, collection wells, and afforestation projects. CARE works all over the country, but&#13;
has concentrated its drought emergency efforts in six districts in Southern Province.&#13;
ZAMBIA SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND (ZAMSIF) under the Ministry of Finance and Economic&#13;
Planning has been implementing over the last two years a community transport infrastructure program&#13;
in poor rural communities. This program is a pilot which has been funded under the World Bank-&#13;
supported Roads Sector Investment Program (ROADSIP). The program maintains roads using labor-&#13;
intensive techniques to provide opportunities to eam cash to as many people as possible. It&#13;
specifically targets women and female-headed households. It has been rated successful as a small-&#13;
scale safety net program providing both cash assistance to beneficiaries and improved access to&#13;
markets and other services by poor communities.&#13;
NATIONAL ROADS BOARD (NRB). The NRB has been serving as the apex of the consortium of&#13;
agencies involved in maintaining Zambia's national roads network. It has significant experience in&#13;
implementing relatively capital-intensive works projects, and less so in undertaking labor-intensive&#13;
works. It has expanded its experience in managing labor-intensive works projects through its&#13;
management of the ROADSIP which includes a component being implemented by ZAMSIF. It has&#13;
also started to employ small-scale labor-based private contractors to carry out works on community&#13;
feeder roads.&#13;
42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
FREE PRIMARY EDUCATION. This is a policy rather than a targeted program. On March 13, 2002, the&#13;
Ministry of Education issued a circular announcing free primary education for children attending&#13;
grades one to seven. The circular instructed schools not to charge students, abolished uniforms, and&#13;
announced that the ministry will pay grants to replace resources previously coming from parents. If&#13;
implemented with a sound design, strong communication strategy, and adequate, sustained financing,&#13;
the policy may allow parents from the poorest households to send their children to school.&#13;
Unfortunately, all these features have been inadequate in the initial stages of implementation.&#13;
Reports from across the country indicate that almost all students in schools in urban areas continue to&#13;
wear school uniforms. Each school, depending on its size, is indeed receiving 2.6-3 million kwacha&#13;
per term as a grant for school requisites (teaching materials, furniture, rehabilitation). Unfortunately,&#13;
the size of the grant is not directly linked either to local costs or poverty or to the funds that schools&#13;
were able to raise from parents prior to this policy shift. As a result, most urban schools feel&#13;
disadvantaged and have continued raising funds from parents. The size of the grant is more favorable&#13;
to the rural schools where the cost-of-living is lower than in urban areas. Problems persist in&#13;
enforcing the no uniforms policy since many children do not have other clothing. The new school&#13;
grant also cannot be used to buy exercise books, pens, erasers, and pencils for pupils and is very&#13;
inadequate.&#13;
It is important for the ministry to continue providing the grant to schools. It should also commission a&#13;
study as soon as possible to specify rules to allocate resource, and link the size of the grant to the&#13;
needs and performance of individual schools.&#13;
Targeted primary school bursaries. The equity and gender component of the Basic Education Sub-&#13;
sector Investment Program (BESSIP). BESSIP manages a targeted primary school bursary scheme to&#13;
pay for the school fees, levies, and other school-related costs for particularly vulnerable children.&#13;
Community committees identify eligible children. Each bursary is worth 77,000 kwacha. Initiated in&#13;
2000, BESSIP provides up to 22,000 bursaries per year. This covers fewer than I percent of primary&#13;
school students in Zambia.&#13;
The Ministry of Education works very closely with the Ministry of Community Development Public&#13;
Welfare Assistance Scheme (PWAS) in implementing the bursary scheme. The PWAS allocates&#13;
notional budget ceilings to its local community committees, who work with heads of schools to&#13;
identify eligible needy children. The names are then passed on to the Ministry of Education for&#13;
assistance. The district offices provide the funds for the Parent Teachers Association directly to&#13;
schools or buy school requisites for the pupils. This scheme so far has been implemented in 16&#13;
districts in all provinces. A memorandum of understanding regarding the administration of the&#13;
bursary scheme exists between the Ministry of Education and the MCDSS. To qualify for the bursary&#13;
the children must be orphans, be children of the destitute, be children of a female-headed household,&#13;
be girls who have passed grade seven but cannot proceed to grades eight and nine for lack of funds, be&#13;
children who have left school and wish to return (provided they fall within the age range).&#13;
A parallel bursary scheme covering 33 districts and involving this year about 41,000 pupils is being&#13;
implemented by the European Union. The EU has hired NGOs to identify the needy students, and&#13;
channels the money through these NGOs. The NGOs in turn buy the school requisites on behalf of&#13;
the pupils. About 65 percent of the recipients are girls. About 25 percent of the bursaries go to pupils&#13;
in community schools.'3&#13;
13    In addition, the Ambassador's Girls Scholarship Program, implemented by the Forum for African&#13;
Women Educationalists in close collaboration with the Education for Democratic Development Initiative,&#13;
offered in 2002 661 bursaries for girls in upper basic schools mostly attending boarding schools. The fees&#13;
amount to 560,000 kwacha per term per pupil to pay for school fees, boarding fees, uniforms, personal effects&#13;
and other items. Six percent of the funds go to children with special needs. Six hundred pounds sterling was&#13;
allocated for this purpose this year. In addition an international NGO campaign for female education is&#13;
supporting a number of girls in two districts in Northern Province.&#13;
43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Given that the free primary education policy is new and schools are still questioning whether&#13;
government will be able to compensate them adequately for lost revenues, parents of schoolchildren&#13;
continue to face local levies of different kinds. The bursary scheme has continued, therefore, to buy&#13;
school uniforms, second hand clothing, shoes, books, pens , pencils, and erasers for needy children to&#13;
enable them to attend school. It is also noteworthy that basic education is from grades one to nine and&#13;
fees and school uniforms have not been abolished for grades eight and nine. Many students at this&#13;
level find it very difficult to raise the mandatory fees. Assistance is also needed to enable qualified&#13;
students to attend senior secondary school, which is out of reach for many parents.&#13;
Both bursary schemes are to meet the needs of the large number of vulnerable children of school-age&#13;
in Zambia. The main constraint appear to be the slow pace at which the PWAS community-&#13;
sensitization efforts have been proceeding. The process of community training and establishment of&#13;
community-committees for identification of beneficiaries has now been completed in 58 districts.&#13;
There is now the scope, and a drastic need, to dramatically scale-up the coverage by the targeted&#13;
BESSIP bursary program. While the emphasis during the immediate emergency should be on&#13;
extending coverage (with no restructuring), the next step will be to restructure the modalities of the&#13;
bursary scheme to reflect the new free education policy.&#13;
Schoolfeeding. BESSIP has two major goals, access and enrollment, neither of which can be&#13;
achieved if children come to school hungry and are generally not in good health. The school health&#13;
and nutrition component of the BESSIP is aimed at improving the health and well being of children.&#13;
It supports the development and management of the supplementary feeding program in schools. A&#13;
special interministerial committee exists on school feeding. No concrete program of action has&#13;
materialized to date regarding an ongoing program. In response to the drought emergency, however,&#13;
the ministry and its partners have revisited the issue and are exploring options to institute a program&#13;
on an emergency basis targeted to the worst-affected districts.&#13;
Community self help. The government has been supporting community self-help schemes under the&#13;
ZAMSIF (previously the Social Recovery Program I and II) and the PUSH programs. These are&#13;
formulated as demand-led programs to improve access of poor communities to social and economic&#13;
infrastructure. They also help to build capacity in communities and district administrations to enable&#13;
them to undertake activities that improve livelihoods and enhance incomes. Social mobilization,&#13;
sensitization, and provision of skills training (project management, literacy, basic accounting,&#13;
negotiating among others) empower communities to articulate their needs, identify solutions, and&#13;
implement projects in partnership with local authorities and NGOs. Communities decide on the best&#13;
use of the available resources and on the beneficiaries.&#13;
Focusing on ZAMSIF, the community contribution paid in-kind or cash by communities working with&#13;
ZAMSIF increases the sense of ownership of the community assets. ZAMSIF has a reputation for&#13;
efficiently delivering resources to communities for direct management. Over time, it has gained&#13;
increasing responsibility for implementing the community-construction components of such programs&#13;
as BESSIP, ROADSIP, and the Environment. Its experience makes it an appropriate agency to assist&#13;
communities construct boreholes and sanitation activities to mitigate the impact of the drought.&#13;
Consumption-enhancing&#13;
Targetedfood assistance. During the current drought, the government is relying on WFP to work&#13;
directly with 29 lead NGOs to distribute food aid in the worst-affected districts. The food aid is&#13;
targeted to households based on a combination of geographic targeting (districts where production&#13;
shortfalls were highest) and indicator-based targeting (see criteria below). As described in the&#13;
government's Emergency Drought Recovery and Mitigation Plan, the government assessed the&#13;
specific food needs of the drought affected population in 3 8 districts through a vulnerability mapping&#13;
exercise undertaken jointly with the UN agencies and NGOs in July 2002. Communities played a&#13;
prominent role in identifying specific households in need. Targeting criteria for households include:&#13;
44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
female headed households, child headed households, disabled-headed households, households&#13;
supporting orphans, households facing calamities including HIV/AIDS and, farm households with less&#13;
that one hectare of land.&#13;
NGOs and district officials agree that community members are vigilant in identifying eligible&#13;
households on the basis of the criteria. However, because the number of correctly-identified&#13;
households still outstrips the levels of available food aid, the beneficiary households tend to share the&#13;
food with others in the community.&#13;
Social assistance to incapacitated people. The PWAS is one of the oldest social programs in Zambia,&#13;
but was dormant for years before the structural adjustment program in 1991 and the 1992 drought. It&#13;
was revived with budgetary financing as part of the 1991/92 drought impact mitigation program. It is&#13;
implemented by the MCDSS. The program provides in-kind assistance (clothes, food, educational&#13;
requirements, and the like) to disabled poor. Under recent reforms, the beneficiaries are selected by&#13;
community public welfare committees, which consist of community representatives. The community&#13;
committees are linked to area and district-level committees which also include NGO and district&#13;
government officers.&#13;
Although it remains the major publicly-financed program for the indigent poor during non-crisis&#13;
years, PWAS is only able to reach an estimated 10 percent of its target population due largely to&#13;
budget constraints. In recent years the government has demonstrated commitment to the PWAS by&#13;
channeling resources to it from HIPC funds.&#13;
Zambia 's social protection and humanitarian response today&#13;
Key features of existing programs include:&#13;
1. Almost all the transfer programs provide the assistance in-kind rather than in cash. Apart from&#13;
some of the agencies implementing public works, most are wary of providing cash to&#13;
beneficiaries or community committees because of problems regarding accountability for the&#13;
funds. This makes it difficult to move to move to a system of providing cash rather than&#13;
commodities. It also increases the potential importance of a cash-for-work schemes as a way of&#13;
increasing the purchasing power of cash-strapped families in the drought areas.&#13;
2. The government of Zambia has a long and relatively successful tradition of implementing safety&#13;
net programs through NGOs. Any scaling up of activities will need to rely on these same NGOs&#13;
and their implementation capacity.&#13;
3. The record of monitoring and evaluation of social safety net interventions is patchy within and&#13;
outside government. Monitoring and evaluation requires strengthening to achieve short and&#13;
medium term results.&#13;
4. Several existing implementation vehicles can be used to expand the existing coverage in the short&#13;
term. The existence and reliable track-record of existing vehicles creates space for the&#13;
government and its partners to developing and introducing new measures, such as school feeding.&#13;
5. The government of Zambia needs to take more forceful action in establishing a coordinating&#13;
mechanism for social safety nets on a nonemergency basis. At a minimum, more formalized&#13;
coordination between the DMMU and MCDSS is advisable.&#13;

Annex 4. Donor Response to the Emergency Drought&#13;
On July 17, 2002 the United Nations launched its consolidated appeal for Zambia. This followed the&#13;
findings of the crop and food assessment and vulnerability analysis carried out jointly by the FAO-&#13;
WFP, Central Statistical Office, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives and cooperating NGOs.&#13;
The joint assessment team estimated that Zambia would face a maize deficit of 635,000 metric tons&#13;
and require humanitarian or food aid of 174,000 metric tons for about 2.3 million people in the worst&#13;
affected 38 districts. Another assessment conducted recently has revised the number of affected&#13;
population to 2.9 million, and the requirement of relief food to 224,000 metric tons. The donor&#13;
response to the appeal has been good. Seven countries have pledged food assistance amounting to&#13;
about 77,365 metric tons (table 3). The main donors include the United States, United Kingdom,&#13;
Netherlands, New Zealand, France, Italy, Tanzania and the European Commission.&#13;
In addition to the food aid, the United Nations and other donors have pledged to support the&#13;
government in health and nutrition, water and sanitation, agricultural production, education, and&#13;
special protection of children and young people. The United States Agency for International&#13;
Development (USAID), Canada, Denmark (in collaboration with WFP and UNICEF), the European&#13;
Union, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Japan are assisting farmers in the affected districts with seeds,&#13;
fertilizers, and tools. Support also includes funding for dissemination of technical messages to the&#13;
farmers and farmer training, to enable them to practice conservation farming (table 1).&#13;
A number of donors are assisting people by constructing boreholes in the areas hit by serious water&#13;
scarcity (Canada, Denmark, USAID and Japan). UNICEF is particularly active in the seriously-&#13;
affected Southern and Western Provinces in providing essential drugs for prevention of malaria and&#13;
immunization. It is also supporting drilling of 100 boreholes for drinking water. UNICEF is also&#13;
providing assistance for school attendance by supporting school feeding programs and supplying dry&#13;
rations for teachers. USAID and other donors are providing funds for the Kazungula Pontoon to&#13;
strengthen this vital transport route for bringing in food and other materials from southern Africa&#13;
(Table 2). Based on pledges made in July and August 2002, the amount of food aid from various&#13;
sources is shown in Table 3.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5: Logistics of Food Distribution&#13;
Logistics offood transport&#13;
The projectedfood traffic. The projected food deficit from the drought is estimated at 630,000&#13;
metric tons. The govemment plans to meet this deficit through intemal and extemal procurement.&#13;
Of the total deficit, the private sector is expected to import 300,000 metric tons (classified as&#13;
commercial maize), WFP 174,000 metric tons (classified as relief maize) through intemational&#13;
appeals and the remaining 156,000 metric tons (classified as relief maize) by the government itself.&#13;
The government has signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the Millers Association for the&#13;
commercial maize and the Association is said to have a stock of about 100,000 within the country&#13;
in their various warehouses mainly in Lusaka. This gives a shortfall in commercial maize of about&#13;
200,000 metric tons. Of the govemment share, government through its own resources and bilateral&#13;
aid has in stock about 4,000 metric tons and has contracted a total of about 22,000 metric tons of&#13;
maize meal leaving a shortfall of about 130,000 metric tons of which the Food Reserve Agency&#13;
expects to bring in about 30,000. The WFP has received about 21,000 metric tons against donor&#13;
commitments totaling over 74,000 metric tons. In mid-September the shortfall between the need&#13;
and what has either been imported or pledged is estimated at about 433,000 metric tons. This&#13;
constitutes the minimum amount of maize which needs to be procured either intemally or&#13;
extemally. Given available information on the scope to buy maize locally, this probably translates&#13;
to an extemal procurement of about 400,000 metric tons between now and April, 2003, when the&#13;
next harvest would come in. This would mean importing monthly about 66,000 metric tons, or&#13;
13,000 metric tons per day. This would require about 430 movements of 30-ton trucks per day.&#13;
Of this, about 25 percent will be handled by WFP, 50 percent will be handled by commercial&#13;
importers, and 25 percent will be handled by the government, assuming their respective import&#13;
shares do not change.&#13;
WFP estimates that it will need to distribute between 17,000 to 25,000 metric tons of food monthly&#13;
over the period September 2002 and March 2003; its present monthly distribution is about 7,000&#13;
metric tons. In addition, it has an obligation to assist with the repatriation of Angolan refugees in&#13;
March 2003 (about 40,000 people) by providing about two months food ration.&#13;
Compared to food imports, agricultural inputs and other materials are small in volume with the&#13;
largest, fertilizer, estimated at about 48,000 metric tons. It would appear that this amount is being&#13;
procured locally with deliveries expected to start in the coming weeks.&#13;
Affected area: About 2.9 million people in 38 districts are assessed as needing direct food&#13;
assistance with 60 percent in the Southem Province, 38 percent in Westem, 37 percent in Eastem&#13;
and 31 percent in Central provinces.&#13;
Food distribution mechanism&#13;
Commercialfood distribution: This first step in the process is procurement of food material from&#13;
either intemal or extemal sources and their delivery at agreed locations. Intemal procurement has&#13;
generally taken place in the surplus regions of the country which did not suffer from rain deficit,&#13;
such as the Copperbelt, and Northem Provinces. This food was transported to Lusaka. Extemal&#13;
procurement has typically been made from the Republic of South Africa (RSA) with Westem&#13;
Transvaal preferred, and from North America. These imports enter Zambia usually by rail or&#13;
truck through Nankonde in Tanzania, Chirundu, Kariba in Zimbabwe and Kasungula in Botswana.&#13;
Little commercial food reaches below the district headquarters level due to lack of demand arising&#13;
from low purchasing power of the rural dwellers.&#13;
Emergency relieffood distribution. The government's strategy to meet the food deficit is to&#13;
procure as much of the needed food material intemally as possible, while relying on the private&#13;
52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
sector and WFP for extemal procurement. Delivery from the nearest extemal source of food&#13;
import, Republic of South Africa, takes between four to six weeks by rail. The govemment and&#13;
WFP engage the services of NGOs in the affected areas to distribute relief food. No major&#13;
logistics problems are faced in getting food down to district headquarters; the major logistics&#13;
problems is present at below the district level, where their poor rural road network and inadequacy&#13;
in availability of transport services are the chief constraints.&#13;
Logistics chain in placefor distribution of relief material. Both the govemment and the WFP rely&#13;
on NGOs and the private transporters, the latter principally for transporting materials to major&#13;
urban centers, and the former responsible for distribution of the materials at the district level to&#13;
beneficiaries. Materials procured extemally are brought in through either of the three ports of&#13;
Beira, Durban, and Dar es Salaam. All these ports are planned to be used, as this will allow&#13;
materials to be taken direct to major centers (Lusaka, Chipata, Katima Mulilo), Kazangula and&#13;
Livingstone from where these would be distributed to the beneficiaries. Spreading of food&#13;
imports through timely ordering and delivery will help to even out pressure on these ports, and the&#13;
entry points in Zambia.&#13;
Assessment of available transport and storage resources&#13;
Road network. Zambia has a primary road network that is generally in good condition and&#13;
passable all year round. It also has 47,000 km of feeder and community roads most of which are&#13;
in bad condition with a significant portion not passable during rainy seasons. This is especially the&#13;
case in Westem, North Westem, Eastem, and Southern Provinces where difficult terrain and&#13;
numerous rivers often combine to make access difficult for about four months in a year of normal&#13;
rainfall. In Westem and Southem Provinces pontoons and boats are the only means of access to&#13;
the more remote but quite populated areas.&#13;
Vehicle capacity. Trucking fleet of private sector is estimated at between 400 and 500 trucks of&#13;
mainly 30- ton capacity each. This represents capacity to move about 12,000 and 15, 000 tons of&#13;
materials daily. This capacity is supplemented by extemally owned trucks which bring materials&#13;
into Zambia, but are allowed to carry goods on local runs within Zambia. The private sector has&#13;
very few 5 and 3 ton vehicles and 4x4 or 6x6, type vehicles that are capable of operating in the&#13;
rural areas. WFP has a mix of 10 and 5 ton trucks, and it has signed an MOU with Oxfam for&#13;
provisioning 10 4x4 10- ton vehicles which will be used at Katima Mulilo in Westem Province for&#13;
getting food to affected refugees. The WFP has been loaned 118 6x6 5- ton capacity trucks by&#13;
the International Federation of the Red Cross as a gift from the Norwegian government. These are&#13;
expected to be returned at the end of the present emergency. It is not clear if WFP trucks could be&#13;
used for movement of materials procured by government and being distributed by its partners.&#13;
This point should be clarified during negotiations. In addition to the above, the government has a&#13;
fleet of tractors (38 Nos.) purchased during the last drought of 1991/92 which are currently&#13;
managed by the WF. A recent inspection indicates that 26 of these can be readily repaired. The&#13;
current demand assessment shows that about ten more tractors would be needed to supply food&#13;
which cannot be reached by heavy trucks.&#13;
Enough trucking capacity seems to be available to meet the projected daily movement needs&#13;
between major urban centers and the district headquarters and other major towns. The area of&#13;
constraint relates to moving food within a district, where the number of smaller trucking units&#13;
available for hire are relatively few. Strengthening of the WFP fleet and repairs and new purchase&#13;
of tractors will go some way in alleviating this problem. It is however important that these&#13;
vehicles are available not only to WFP but also their partner NGOs whose operations are crucial&#13;
for reaching food to the ultimate beneficiaries.&#13;
Rail transport. Two rail systems, the Zambia National Railways which will be operating under&#13;
concession from November 1, 2002, and the Tanzania and Zambia Railways Authority (TAZARA)&#13;
are the main rail transporters. The latter is the principal capacity for the movement of goods into&#13;
53&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the country from the port of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, while the former is responsible for intemal&#13;
movement of goods from the railhead at Kapiri Mposhi to Lusaka. With its concessioning to&#13;
Spoomet of South Africa, it is expected that the Zambian Railways will increase its traffic&#13;
movement from Republic of South Africa. TAZARA has a holding fleet of 61 mainline&#13;
locomotives of which only seven are in good condition and operate the Zambian traffic. Trains&#13;
operate in groups of 30 wagons (each wagon carrying 50 tons) thus giving a load of 1,500 tons per&#13;
rake. The average annual haul of TAZARA in the last three years is 600,000 metric tons, but in&#13;
the previous five years it averaged 750,000 metric tons In the crucial a six month period of the&#13;
current emergency, close to 300,000 metric tons ton can be moved by TAZARA. The standard&#13;
schedule to cover the 1,860 kilometers toumey from Dar to Kapiri Mposhi should take 4 days,&#13;
with an additional day to move further on to Lusaka. Typically however, the journey can take as&#13;
much as 11 days due to delays in trans-shipment in Kapiri Mposhi, and speed restrictions on the&#13;
Zambian Rail track between Kapiri and Lusaka. The trans-shipment delays are often due to lack&#13;
of shunting locomotives, which also causes delay in off-loading in Lusaka.&#13;
TAZARA charges US$63.24/ ton for transporting maize from Dar to Lusaka, but has presently&#13;
reduced the tariff to US$57/ton. Fertilizer movement is charged at the same rate. Additional&#13;
rebate for bulk movement can be authorized by the Managing Director. TAZARA is presently in&#13;
discussion with three suppliers for the delivery of 200,000 metric tons of maize into the country;&#13;
and has secured a contract to transport 48,000 metric tons of fertilizers. The above freight rates&#13;
include fees of freight forwarders for traffic moving between Lusaka and Republic of South Africa&#13;
and for traffic between Dar es Salaam and Lusaka.&#13;
Derailments on the Zambia Railways is due to low ballast and weak sleepers. Remedial works are&#13;
continuing but existing program of repairs and improvements would take longer, and may not help&#13;
the current emergency.&#13;
From the above analysis, it would appear that there is sufficient capacity in the rail system to&#13;
meet potential demand of the current emergency. However, for reliability it is recommended that&#13;
some remedial works are carried out to reduce possibility of derailment and to reduce speed&#13;
restrictions.&#13;
Road transport rates: Rates charged by transporters have increased significantly over the last&#13;
year, especially between Lusaka and Republic of South Africa. For example, last year, the typical&#13;
rate for road haulage between West Transvaal and Lusaka was US$45 per ton; this year it has&#13;
increased and varies between US$65 and US$85 per ton. As the crisis within the region increases,&#13;
and the available truck fleet comes under greater pressure of demand, these rates are likely to&#13;
increase further. The cost per ton kilometers for traffic such as maize by road within Zambia is in&#13;
the range of US$0.04 and US$0. 10, the higher rate applying for short distances and the more&#13;
difficult destinations.&#13;
Food transport costs. About a third of the total cost of relief food is attributable to transportation&#13;
from source of procurement to the place of consumption. In the case of WFP relief food, the&#13;
transportation costs are usually included in the donation. This will, however, not be the case for&#13;
the government relief food, and a budget provision would need to be made for the transportation&#13;
from importing ports, and movements within the country. Assuming that the estimated 30,000&#13;
metric tons of food to be imported by the Food Reserve Agency will fall into this group, a&#13;
provision of US$2.5 million would be needed to meet these costs.&#13;
Alternative routesfor imports. Relief materials are sourced principally from the Republic of South&#13;
Africa, Europe and North America. Those from Europe and North America can come in through&#13;
either of the ports of (a) Dar es Salaam in Tanzania (then transported by road onward to Lusaka&#13;
through Nankonde); (b) Beira in Mozambique (then onward through Malawi into Chipata or&#13;
Lusaka); and (c) Durban in Republic of South Africa (then onward to Livingstone or Lusaka&#13;
through Chirundu, Kariba and Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe). Maize shipments, sourced directly&#13;
54&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
from Republic of South Africa are mainly from Western Transvaal and transported by road&#13;
entering Zambia at Kasungula via Botswana. Transport costs through the Republic of South&#13;
Africa routes are regarded slightly cheaper than those from the north through Tanzania. Noting&#13;
that these ports will also be used by other countries which are similarly affected by the present&#13;
drought, the considered opinion is that with good and well coordinated forward planning, the ports&#13;
and the trucking industry have the capacity to meet anticipated regional demand. The key&#13;
constraints are more likely to be those internal to the countries such as the bad state of the&#13;
pontoons at Kasungula in the case of Zambia. Locomotive and rolling stock availability is not&#13;
regarded a problem given the prevailing cooperation arrangements between the rail operators&#13;
involved in shipment of goods to hire these equipment amongst themselves.&#13;
Storage facilities. The parastatal Food Reserve Agency has a storage capacity of approximately&#13;
1.5 million metric tons principally in Lusaka and major urban centers in the smaller facilities&#13;
scattered all over the country. The DMMU and other government agencies rely on this storage&#13;
capacity; besides the private sector rents storage space from the Food Reserve Agency. The WFP&#13;
has its own storage capacity for 20,000 metric tons located in Lusaka (12,000 metric tons),&#13;
Livingstone (3,000 metric tons) and Chipata (about 5,000 metric tons). It considers these to be&#13;
sufficient under normal operational circumstances when distribution takes place in a planned&#13;
manner. In the private sector, the millers generally have enough storage capacities of their own,&#13;
and the private sector companies such as Sable are investing in these facilities. The installed&#13;
storage capacity is therefore regarded as sufficient for projected needs, if no serious bottle-neck is&#13;
created as a result of distribution problems.&#13;
Addressing identified constraints&#13;
The government's basic strategy in dealing with the task of moving relief materials to the people in&#13;
the affected 38 districts should be underpinned by good coordination of the activities of all&#13;
stakeholders involved in ordering, shipment, certification, customs processing, storage and&#13;
distribution of relief materials. By so doing, it would avoid the bunching of relief food arrivals,&#13;
minimize double handling and reduce storage and transport costs. The government should also&#13;
take steps to improve the systems in place for tracking internal movement of relief materials, to&#13;
ensure their safe and timely distribution to beneficiaries. Crucially, government should make sure&#13;
that institutional barriers are removed to allow full utilization of logistical resources available&#13;
within the country. To address identified transport and logistics problems, the following specific&#13;
recommendations are made:&#13;
General: (a) forward planning to ensure timely placement of orders for procurement of relief&#13;
materials; (b) through consultations between DMMU and WFP and their partners, ensure that&#13;
needed military resources are mobilized in time to address problems which civil resources will not&#13;
be able to address; (c) establish procedures for ensuring that available transportation resources&#13;
(vehicles, tractors, and the like) are allocated on the basis of need between DMMU, WFP and&#13;
partner NGOs involved in distribution of food materials:&#13;
Specific.&#13;
(a). Strengthen capacity of Operations, Logistics and Management Unit of DMMU, and fill in&#13;
vacancies.&#13;
(b). Recruit on short-term basis, an experienced logistics professional with hands-on experience&#13;
of field management of logistics operation of the magnitude which would be mounted during&#13;
the next 12 months - a draft terms of reference is attached (estimated cost US$72,000 plus&#13;
cost of 4x4 vehicle with radio).&#13;
(c) Develop logistics operations manual for the unit.&#13;
(d) Establish communication and operations center within the unit (estimated cost US$45,000).&#13;
(e) Improve rural road network in key locations in the 38 affected districts using labor intensive&#13;
work methods. This is estimated to cost about US$7,000,000.&#13;
(f) Repair and rehabilitate some presently unserviceable pontoons (estimated cost US$600,000).&#13;
55&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(g) Install 12 bailey bridges at critical river crossings (estimated cost US$480,000).&#13;
(h) Repair and rehabilitate 26 tractors that have been inspected and classified as repairable&#13;
(estimated cost US$90,000).&#13;
(i) Procure ten new tractors and distribute tractors such that all affected districts needing tractors&#13;
for haulage have at least one tractor readily available (estimated cost US$150,000);&#13;
(I) In consultation with DMMU and WFP, Roads Department and NRB prioritize critical&#13;
bridges that need to be strengthened, and undertake works (estimated cost US$400,000).&#13;
(k) Zambia Railways to undertake strengthening (ballast and sleeper replacement) of rail track&#13;
beds to prevent derailment and to curtail speed restrictions (estimated cost is US$850,000).&#13;
Food transport cost. In addition, US$2.5 million needs to be provided for the transportation of&#13;
about 30,000 metric tons of government relief material into the country and their internal&#13;
distribution.&#13;

Annex 6: World Bank's Support for Drought Mitigation&#13;
A.     Emergency Drought Recovery Project interventions&#13;
Component A. Quick-disbursing assistance tofinance a positive list of imports (US$35 million)&#13;
The Bank's emergency assistance will finance a positive list of imports needed for drought&#13;
mitigation. The positive list includes:&#13;
(i)    Agricultural equipment and inputs&#13;
(ii)   Petroleum and fuel products&#13;
(iii)  Construction material&#13;
(iv)   Transport vehicles, motor bicycles, bicycles and spare parts&#13;
(v)    Livestock and animal products and veterinary supplies&#13;
(vi)   School supplies and equipment&#13;
(vii)  Medical supplies and equipment&#13;
(viii)  Construction equipment.&#13;
The imports would be used to restore agricultural production, repair and improve rural roads and&#13;
bridges, improve water supplies for both human and animal consumption, provide transportation&#13;
services, and supply schools and medical services with essential supplies.&#13;
Component B. Safety net interventions aimed at improving access to marketsfor essential&#13;
commodities and services by vulnerable groups (US$ 7 million)&#13;
Objective. The safety net program aims to alleviate the impact of the drought on vulnerable people&#13;
and improve their livelihoods by providing in-kind or cash assistance to households for 18 months&#13;
through labor intensive road and other infrastructure improvement activities. Indirectly, the&#13;
component will help to stimulate the rural economy and enhance welfare by improving access of&#13;
people to essential goods and services.&#13;
Description. This program will consist of spot improvements (construction, repair, rehabilitation,&#13;
and maintenance) to public assets in 38 districts in poor rural and urban districts most affected by&#13;
the drought using labor intensive work methods. Assets include feeder roads, community roads,&#13;
roads in periurban and urban areas, sanitation and drainage structures in urban and rural areas. The&#13;
works (subprojects) are estimated to cost an average of US$20,000 for improvement of about five&#13;
kilometers of road, culverts, and small bridges and related drainage structures. The road sections&#13;
need not be along the same road link. Over 700 projects will be carried out, improving about&#13;
1,700 kilometers of feeder and community roads. Consultants working with the NRB will identify&#13;
the interventions in coordination with the department of roads, local authorities, and communities.&#13;
The works will be executed using small-scale certified labor-based road works contractors, NGOs,&#13;
or other groups employing workers from the area where the sub-projects would be implemented.&#13;
The road works will be selected based on their locality (drought affected areas), priority for&#13;
communities, and local authorities.&#13;
Activity selection criteria. All implementing agencies will use the following criteria to select&#13;
works to be financed under this component:&#13;
I . Labor content of total subproject minus administrative cost is at least 60 percent,&#13;
administrative costs and overhead is no more than 10 percent, tools and other operating costs&#13;
account for 30 percent.&#13;
2. Women comprise at least 60 percent of employed labor force.&#13;
3. Employed labor will be paid 5,000 kwacha per day, prorated according to hours worked.&#13;
4. No more than one member per household will be employed per project.&#13;
57&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5. The project will be carried out by labor-intensive works methods on a task work basis using&#13;
simple and proven technical approaches, and be ready for immediate implementation once&#13;
approved.&#13;
6. The works will be located within about 15 kilometers of the target community.&#13;
7. Participants will not be expected to work on average more than four hours per day, based on a&#13;
flexible schedule.&#13;
8. Childcare facilities will be available (for example elderly women paid by the program to take&#13;
care of children) at work sites where necessary to facilitate women's participation.&#13;
9. All subprojects will be in one of the 38 districts identified as affected by the drought.&#13;
10. All subprojects will be completed within a period of 18 months and have an implementation&#13;
period no longer than three months.&#13;
Target group. The target groups under this component are the vulnerable people living in the 3 8&#13;
districts most affected by the crisis. The vulnerable may be divided into four groups: (a)&#13;
vulnerable and inactive (relief recipients, unable to work); (b) vulnerable and active (relief&#13;
recipients, but able to work); (c) affected, but coping and able to participate in cash-for-work&#13;
schemes or benefit from self-employment; and (d) unaffected (potential beneficiary as provider of&#13;
project-financed works and or services). The subcomponent will target groups (b) and (c). It will&#13;
help move as many people into group (d) as possible. The program will also especially target&#13;
women by requiring at least 60 percent of people employed to be women. To facilitate the&#13;
participation of women, childcare facilities will be provided at works. The subcomponent will&#13;
target the poor by offering wages equivalent to the current minimum wage for unskilled labor&#13;
(5,000 kwacha per day). This is the same as the wage rate being used by NGOs in food-for-work&#13;
programs.&#13;
Benefits and risks. An estimated 5,760,000 person days of employment (equivalent of 288,000&#13;
beneficiaries working 20 days each) will be created through the subcomponent. In addition, about&#13;
3,500 kilometers of road sections will be improved, and culverts, bridges, and drainage structures&#13;
will be repaired or provided. The labor content of works other than road rehabilitation may be less&#13;
than 60 percent. However, communities, district councils, and implementing NGOs are&#13;
encouraged to select works with high labor content. The component will significantly increase&#13;
food security, incomes, and access in the areas where the subprojects are implemented.&#13;
Major risks relate to: (a) the remoteness of some areas, making supervision difficult; (b) lack of&#13;
responsiveness of the people in cash-for work opportunities because food is not available in the&#13;
market for purchase and cash holds little value; (c) inadequate attention to quality of work by&#13;
project implementers because of the emergency nature of the activities; (d) poor flow of funds to&#13;
program implementers and thus to beneficiaries; and (e) poor monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
program activities and impact. To mitigate these risks, the subcomponent will (a) rely on agencies&#13;
and groups with ongoing operations in the subproject areas to implement subprojects; (b) rely on&#13;
the NRB for supervision; (c) ensure activities are coordinated with distribution of commercial and&#13;
relief food; (d) ensure that all implementers have good track records in implementing the type of&#13;
activities with which they are being entrusted; (e) disburse funds to NRB and, through NRB, to&#13;
other implementing agencies on a quarterly basis with replenishment against reconciled monthly&#13;
statement of accounts (the NRB has a good track record in coordination, financial management,&#13;
procurement, and monitoring and evaluation of complex activities undertaken by several&#13;
implementing agencies); and (f) agree with each implementing agency monitoring and evaluation&#13;
indicators to be reported to NRB on a quarterly basis.&#13;
Implementation arrangements. The program and its budget will be administered by the NRB&#13;
under the Ministry of Communication and Transport. The NRB will also serve as the secretariat&#13;
for a program steering committee chaired by the DMMU and consisting of the Ministry of&#13;
Communication and Transport, NRB, Ministry of Local Govemment and Housing, department of&#13;
roads and all implementing agencies. The NRB will convene meetings of the steering committee&#13;
every three months or so to review implementation progress and any other program related issues.&#13;
58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The NRB will coordinate the implementation of the program and other infrastructure rehabilitation&#13;
activities and ensure program implementation based on agreed guidelines. The NRB will also&#13;
ensure that the program budget, activities, and geographic coverage are divided among the various&#13;
implementing agencies. It will also provide support for supervision to implementing agencies&#13;
where necessary. It will provide quarterly progress reports on the implementation of the works,&#13;
and technical audits and financial statements to the Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit and&#13;
the World Bank. It will submit every six months audited financial statements.&#13;
Under the administration of the NRB, five agencies will implement the in-kind or cash-for-work&#13;
programs. They are the Ministry of Local Government and Housing, CARE International,&#13;
Program for Urban Self-Help (PUSH), World Vision International, and the Zambia Social&#13;
Investment Fund (ZAMSIF). Implementing agencies will pay laborers on a weekly basis at the&#13;
agreed wage rate-cash or in kind-equivalent. They will implement the subprojects themselves, or&#13;
subcontract implementation to skilled/certified small labor-based works contractors. All&#13;
implementing agencies and small contractors will be provided with resources to cover their&#13;
operating and administrative costs (up to 10 percent of program cost). In the case of NRB, this&#13;
resource will be up to 15 percent of the costs of road works to cover costs of administration,&#13;
services of consultants and contractors identifying works, design and implementation, and the&#13;
overall coordination of the works. Where contractors are used, the contractor will be responsible&#13;
for timely payments to laborers on a weekly basis at the agreed wage rate. To ensure flow of funds&#13;
to beneficiaries and to minimize misuse of funds, all small works contractors and NGOs will be&#13;
required to keep a roster of people employed per project (verified and initialed by community&#13;
representatives) which will be submitted as part of supporting documentation of the monthly&#13;
statement of expenditures. In cases where payments to laborers are made in food or in agricultural&#13;
inputs obtained through noncommercial channels (such as the WFP), the implementing agency&#13;
will provide written assurance to the NRB (in the form of an agreement with the supplier covering&#13;
program implementation period) that the food or inputs will be available in a timely manner. The&#13;
NRB will ensure through spot checks of subprojects that contractors comply with the agreed&#13;
guidelines. Contractors who are in violation of the agreements will be barred from the program.&#13;
The NRB will be responsible for providing every month statements of expenditure along with&#13;
supporting documentation to the DMMU. The NRB will appoint a financial management&#13;
specialist/accountant to be responsible for the safety net component. It is expected that the NRB&#13;
will use the financial management system and the human resources available to them under the&#13;
ROADSIP project, supplementing capacity with resources provided under this program. Each&#13;
implementing agency will submit to the NRB statements of expenditure every month and financial&#13;
statements every six months. The flow of funds for ZAMSIF will follow guidelines in its&#13;
Development Credit Agreement.&#13;
Only minor procurement is expected under the safety net component. Procurement will be for&#13;
purchase of equipment and materials needed to for roads maintenance and other small&#13;
infrastructure rehabilitation projects. As average project cost is fixed at a maximum of&#13;
US$20,000, either local shopping methods will be used or larger purchases of goods and services&#13;
will be made according to World Bank procurement guidelines.&#13;
Monitoring and evaluation. The NRB will coordinate the monitoring and evaluation of the safety&#13;
net component using the facilities available under the ROADSIP project. A specialist will be&#13;
appointed for this task. The existing resources may be supplemented through resources available&#13;
under this component. A program monitoring template will be developed and agreed among all&#13;
implementers. The template will include the following indicators:&#13;
Number of people employed and paid per project&#13;
Number of people employed and paid per month&#13;
Number of women employed and paid per project&#13;
Number of women employed and paid per month average&#13;
59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Number of days of employment per person&#13;
Wage rate being paid (cash or in kind)&#13;
Geographic location (district and name of community)&#13;
Type of project&#13;
Cost per project&#13;
Total administrative cost per project&#13;
Duration of project&#13;
The safety net component is expected to become a long-term feature of the safety net system in&#13;
Zambia. An evaluation of this program will help decision makers in designing effective and&#13;
financially sustainable safety net programs. A safety net review to be financed under the EDRP&#13;
will recommend approaches that can be used during emergencies and while providing adequate&#13;
protection for the needy during normal times.&#13;
Component C. Distribution of a package of agricultural inputs and technologies (US$7 million)&#13;
Objectives. The proposed intervention will provide agricultural inputs, training in appropriate land&#13;
and water management techniques to improve the capacity of an expanded number of targeted&#13;
farmers to engage in agricultural production for the upcoming season (2002/3). The proposed&#13;
intervention shall be implemented within the framework of the introduction of Technology Packs&#13;
carried out by NGOs It will be similar to the Food Security Pack implemented by Program&#13;
against Malnutrition and other NGOs but would differ on the area the service will be provided.&#13;
The main technological components of the program will be diversified seed and planting materials&#13;
and conservation farmning (including soil fertility inputs).&#13;
The seed and planting materials will be delivered in a basic empowerment pack to support an area&#13;
of land under cereal, legume and root or tuber. The table below shows a technology pack that was&#13;
delivered by Program Against Malnutrition and satellite of NGOs in the past two years. This&#13;
technology pack will be designed to optimize natural soil processes and to balance food security&#13;
requirements of resource poor households.&#13;

NGOs implementing this program will work closely with specialized institutions including&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives extension workers, to train farmers in conservation&#13;
farming using fast-track and medium-track methods where appropriate.&#13;
60&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The pack shall generally be free to the farmers. However, NGOs will encourage farmers to&#13;
contribute to community cereal banks in kind. Each community would manage its cereal/seed&#13;
bank based on contributions from beneficiaries. The cereal/seed banks would be managed by&#13;
cereal bank manager appointed by members of the community. The initial stocks would come&#13;
from repayments in the first year. Beneficiaries would pay back an amount to be determined by&#13;
the communities together with the NGOs.&#13;
There will be need for the program management to link in with related community programs such&#13;
as the Rural Investment Fund and the Zambia Social Investment Fund, so that on-storage&#13;
infrastructure can be improved for inputs and grain.&#13;
Target group. The target group for the program shall be vulnerable and food insecure farmers in&#13;
all districts of Zambia with priority for resource allocation given to the worst affected areas in the&#13;
18 districts identified by the Joint FAO-WFP/GRZ/NGO vulnerability assessment team. These&#13;
farmers have low physical level of activity, resulting in reduced labor for food production.&#13;
HIV/AIDS has worsened this scenario. Most are headed by women. These households do not&#13;
have adequate resources to subsist, and cannot participate-in labor intensive cash crops to&#13;
supplement their food needs. Most of them do not own livestock, equipment or machinery. They&#13;
do not produce for the market. Their earnings are so low that they cannot afford to buy basic&#13;
needs. This intervention however, is capable of raising their productivity to levels that can enable&#13;
them meet subsistence needs and gain a surplus for sale.&#13;
Targeting methodology and criteria for selection of beneficiaries. The targeting criteria used will&#13;
be the following: households cultivating less than one hectare of land; female-headed households;&#13;
households headed by children; disabled households; households supporting orphans; household&#13;
affected by natural calamities; unemployed youth. At the national level, statistics on the national&#13;
food security status have been used to determine the number of beneficiaries in each district. At&#13;
the community level, the community welfare assistance committees have used the criteria&#13;
developed above to identify the farmers who are vulnerable. A registration form will also be used&#13;
to identify beneficiaries. In order to qualify, beneficiaries will need to have cleared land, show&#13;
willingness to adopt conservation farning where the technology is advised and be willing to&#13;
contribute to the community cereal/seed bank. In many cases there are more beneficiaries who&#13;
meet the targeting criteria than there are resources to reach them. Under these conditions NGOs&#13;
will rely on the local level community selection structures to make final decisions on who should&#13;
benefit.&#13;
Implementation arrangements. A national steering committee, comprising representatives of&#13;
MCDSS , the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, the DMMU and others will oversee the&#13;
work under this program. NGOs will implement the program through their network of community&#13;
based organizations. All participating NGOs will coordinate, orient, sensitize and train&#13;
cooperating partners; procure, mobilize and distribute seed and planting materials; monitor and&#13;
ensure timely reporting and auditing (i.e. registration forms, accounting guidelines and paper&#13;
trails). Implementing NGOs and community based organizations will work with community&#13;
welfare assistance committees to select beneficiaries; work with extension services to train&#13;
beneficiaries; manage and account for materials procured from the credit prepare and submit&#13;
progress reports to the district and area food security committees; the steering committee and&#13;
DMMU staff that have oversight responsibility will encourage the formation of an NGO&#13;
Coordination Forum to ensure overlap and leakages are minimized.&#13;
Financing plan and procurement. About US$7 million has been set aside for this program. The&#13;
program would incur direct purchase and transport costs related to the inputs. In addition, there&#13;
would be costs related to capacity building training in conservation farming, cereal/seed banks&#13;
establishment and management, and marketing and entrepreneurial skills for farmers and local&#13;
NGOs.&#13;
61&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Participating NGOs, which will be selected by the DMMU based on IDA procurement guidelines,&#13;
will submit detailed budgets to the DMMU not exceeding US$2 million for each NGO. The&#13;
DMMU will assess the implementation capacity of NGOs at selection stage.&#13;
Incremental costs associated with the technological pack eligible under the EDRP can be broken&#13;
down into broad categories, for which two financing mechanisms are available. An amount to be&#13;
determined by the DMMU and agreed by the Bank will be covered under the fast-disbursing&#13;
component of the project if the items are in the positive list. Procurement has to take place as per&#13;
guidelines agreed with IDA. These items are also eligible for retroactive financing. Other costs&#13;
can be covered in the investment component that is provided under DMMU for this intervention.&#13;
Program monitoring. Monitoring will involve various levels at community level using peer group,&#13;
extension and community based organizations. At the district level, the satellite committees and&#13;
community-based organizations will do the monitoring. At provincial level, the disaster&#13;
management committees and the agricultural extension service will provide monitoring and&#13;
follow-up activities. A beneficiary impact assessment survey in the target communities will be&#13;
conducted before the closing date of the project.&#13;
Animal disease controlprogram The livestock sub-sector comprises approximately 2.8million&#13;
cattle, Imillion goats, 80,000 sheep, and 480,000 pigs with the largest population found in the&#13;
traditional sector. Livestock distribution in the country indicates that Southem, Eastern, Western&#13;
and Central provinces all drought affected areas account for 89 percent of the cattle population.&#13;
Eastern and Southern Provinces have 80 percent of the goat population and 83 percent of the total&#13;
pig population. The effect of the drought on livestock is multi-faceted. Reduced rains lead to&#13;
reduced grazing and drinking water. The poor grazing results in animals trekking longer distances&#13;
in search of grazing pastures and water. The walking of long distances reduces the time available&#13;
for grazing leading to weaker and more disease prone animals. Drought forces animals to&#13;
concentrate in small areas accelerating the spread of diseases. As animals lose condition as a&#13;
result of poor grazing they are predisposed to disease. Most dip tanks close down due to lack of&#13;
water to replenish the tanks. High animal mortalities are experienced during droughts&#13;
exacerbating the chronic problem of animal diseases control. The link between high cattle&#13;
mortality and rising poverty levels has been established. Statistics on animal mortality as a result&#13;
of the current drought are unavailable.&#13;
The rapid privatization of veterinary services contributed to high animal mortalities as many&#13;
farmers could not afford the high cost of veterinary services. The government has proposed an&#13;
emergency animal disease control program. This proposal is targeted at the control of diseases of&#13;
national economic importance. These are mostly diseases of an epidemic nature, have significance&#13;
or are major zoonoses. They all affect the productivity of livestock either through direct losses&#13;
caused by mortality and decreased production or indirect losses resulting from effects on trade,&#13;
draught power, manure etc. The major diseases of national economic importance covered in this&#13;
proposal are contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, foot and mouth disease, theileriosis (east coast&#13;
fever), tsetse transmitted trypanosomosis, anthrax and rabies.&#13;
The operational cost of the Government's disease control program will supported under EDRP and&#13;
the import of vaccines will be handled through imports, if covered under the positive list.&#13;
Expected output. The program would assist in the following outputs: 25,000 cattle will be treated&#13;
for ECF; 100,000cattle will be vaccinated against ECF; 950,000 cattle will be vaccinated against&#13;
CBPP; 290,000 cattle will be vaccinated against FMD; 280,000 cattle will be vaccinated against&#13;
Anthrax and 40,000 people at risk will be protected. Livestock mortalities caused by&#13;
corridor/theileriosis or east coast fever and bovine pleuropneumonia will be reduced by over 70&#13;
percent.&#13;
62&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Implementation of these activities will be carried out by the field staff of the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture and Cooperatives under the supervision of the deputy director, and assisted by the&#13;
chief veterinary officer in the department of research and specialist services. The technical&#13;
advisory group will provide technical assistance to ensure efficiency and effective coverage.&#13;
Component D: Improving early warning system and disaster management and mitigation capacity&#13;
(US$1 million)&#13;
Under the proposed project support has been provided to (a) strengthen the DMMU by recruiting&#13;
key specialists who would assist the DMMU in the short-term to implement a time bound program&#13;
in 24 months under a quick disbursing credit, and provide training to the local govemment staff as&#13;
a part of the capacity building objective; (and) (b) catalyze the development of government&#13;
capacity in the long-term to handle droughts and famines and other disasters. The support for the&#13;
long-term measures includes strengthening the national meteorology office data analysis and&#13;
forecasting capacity, and technical assistance (i) for streamlining and strengthening the&#13;
institutional and organizational arrangements for Early Warning in the govemment; (ii) to review&#13;
and finalize govemment's disaster mitigation and management policy; (iii) preparation of a&#13;
national drought and famine code; and (iv) to strengthen data collection, monitoring, and&#13;
dissemination systems in the key govemment agencies. The study recommendations would likely&#13;
require investment decisions to improve and strengthen the system over time, and the government.&#13;
has agreed to pursue the implementation of these recommendations under the ongoing and&#13;
proposed World Bank and other donor investment operations such as the proposed IDA-supported&#13;
and soon-to-be finalized Agricultural Development and Support Project.&#13;
Strengthening the Zambia meteorology department. This organization is using old instruments&#13;
from the 1 950/60s, nearly 13 district do not have appropriate equipment or instruments,&#13;
institution's capacity for data analysis and forecasting is weak, and because of resource constraints&#13;
this vital organ at the forefront of the early warning chain has not been able to perform its tasks&#13;
satisfactorily, marginalizing the effort downstream as well. Action is proposed on two fronts: (i)&#13;
to provide technical assistance for a professional study to recommend the upgrading of the weather&#13;
monitoring and forecasting system, and (ii) meeting the immediate equipment requirements of the&#13;
Meteorology Office.&#13;
Streamlining the organizational arrangements. A study is proposed to streamline the system by&#13;
situation analysis of the roles and responsibilities of the key government agencies involved in early&#13;
warning, their current location, study options for organizational re-location for optimum utility and&#13;
effectiveness, and re-structuring of the key institutions/organizations as warranted consistent with&#13;
effectiveness, efficiency and economy, and to provide specific recommendations for human&#13;
resource development.&#13;
Strengthening the DMMU. The addition of a large portfolio under the proposed World Bank credit&#13;
would increase DMMU's burden and weaken it further. It is therefore proposed to strengthen the&#13;
DMMU with the addition of a sub-section, which would handle the World Bank project activities,&#13;
and have the required specialists to assist DMMU to implement a time bound program of 24&#13;
months under a quick disbursing credit. The sub-section would be headed by EDRP Coordinator,&#13;
and staffed by a procurement specialist, a financial officer and a logistics specialist with&#13;
appropriate support staff like a steno and a typist. Funding for operating cost, procurement of&#13;
vehicles and office equipment will be provided. The government request for technical assistance&#13;
for the following key activities/studies which would help achieve the policy and operational&#13;
sustainability objectives of the disaster mitigation and management initiatives of the government&#13;
will also be supported: (i) to review and finalize the government's disaster mitigation and&#13;
management policy; (ii) consistent with the national policy on disaster, and the provisions of the&#13;
proposed disaster management bill to prepare a detailed drought and famine code to provide&#13;
guidelines for step by step implementation to all the actors involved in these activities at the&#13;
community, district and national levels; (iii) to establish an appropriate data collection, analysis&#13;
63&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and dissemination system and an MIS together with recommendations for institutional&#13;
strengthening and capacity building in this regard, and hard/soft ware requirements to operate the&#13;
system.&#13;
Strengthening the MCDSS. It is proposed that resources be provided to carry out studies to assist&#13;
(a) MCDSS to redefine its role and responsibilities in respect of the nation-wide safety net&#13;
interventions, review capacity of the ministry and all other agencies responsible for&#13;
implementation on the ground, and suggest an appropriate structure and operating procedures to&#13;
enhance focus on and effective implementation of the social safety net initiatives;(b) enhance&#13;
monitoring, evaluation functions of the MCDSS Department of Planning and provide an effective&#13;
MIS; and (c) prepare a long term social protection strategy.&#13;
B.     Support under the existing bank portfolio&#13;
The Bank has undertaken a portfolio review to determine additional/complimentary sources of&#13;
funding in support of the proposed EDRP, to broaden drought mitigation and recovery activities.&#13;
The projects that have implementation capacity, experience in related areas and which would not&#13;
require major restructuring and processing time in amending Development Credit Agreements&#13;
were chosen for this purpose and include projects such as the National Road Rehabilitation&#13;
Program (ROADSIP), Power Rehabilitation, Railways, Mine Township Project, ERIPTA which&#13;
supports the privatization process as well as Zambia Social Investment Fund, which supports a&#13;
demand led approach to community development.&#13;
The intervention discussed below will have to be discussed and details about the operations&#13;
prepared. The project implementing agencies have to take full responsibility for the&#13;
implementation of the proposed intervention and the Ministry of Finance and National Planning&#13;
would coordinate these initiatives. Where reallocation of project fund from one category to&#13;
another is needed, timely actions have to be taken by the implementing agencies, Ministry of&#13;
Finance and National Planning and the Bank.&#13;
Safety nets (US$12.2 million)&#13;
A public works program similar to the one funded under EDRP and discussed above will be&#13;
implemented by Zambia Social Investment Fund (ZAMSIF). The major difference between the&#13;
two is the source of funding and the modality of operation. ZAMSIF under the Ministry of&#13;
Finance and Economic Planning has been implementing over the last two years a Community&#13;
Transport Infrastructure program in poor rural communities. This program is a pilot, which has&#13;
been funded under the ROADSIP program. The program is a labor-intensive road maintenance&#13;
program, which provides cash assistance to beneficiaries. It specifically targets women and&#13;
female-headed households. The primary objective of ZAMSIF is providing a safety net but its&#13;
emphasis of working with communities to empower and train them in the management of&#13;
resources may, in the long term, provide valuable returns in terms of greater self-reliance. Its&#13;
experience in demand-driven rehabilitation and construction of small-scale infrastructure also&#13;
makes it suitable to use as an implementation vehicle for dip tanks, small dams, boreholes and&#13;
sanitation activities being proposed by various agencies in the context of the drought mitigation&#13;
efforts. The funding for public works and other community driven interventions will come form&#13;
ZAMSIF and a limited amount from ROADSIP.&#13;
Emergency Supplemental School Feeding Program (US$5 million)&#13;
Objective. The objective of this intervention will be to keep children in school and to encourage&#13;
those that are staying away to come back to school. The Ministry of Education has not yet&#13;
implemented its school feeding program. Therefore, during this food crisis a response is necessary&#13;
especially for girls who may be forced to stay home to help look for food.&#13;
64&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Description. The program is conceived as having two activities: (a) a daily high energy protein&#13;
supplement being distributed at school to all the children attending the targeted schools. The high&#13;
energy protein supplement should be provided as the first activity at school (breakfast for children&#13;
attending the morning shift and lunch for those arriving for the aftemoon shift); and (b) a monthly&#13;
targeted take-home ration supplement to children from particularly disadvantaged households&#13;
qualifying for free food distribution conditional on continued school attendance by the child. The&#13;
proposed high energy protein supplement ration will be determined in accordance with WFP,&#13;
UNESCO and WHO guidelines aimed at providing acceptable energy, protein and fat levels. For&#13;
ease of distribution, the ration will be preferably in the form of a fortified biscuit. The take home&#13;
ration would consist of one 25 kilograms of maize meal per pupil per month for six months. This&#13;
would have to be provided by the donor community through WFP. This will be considered for&#13;
vulnerable households and will be provided in accordance with the WFP food families during the&#13;
food crisis period.&#13;
Geographic coverage. The Ministry of Education has decided that only the 18 worst-affected&#13;
areas should be covered under this phase of the proposed program. This includes the districts&#13;
shown in table below. The intervention will target both community and government schools in&#13;
these districts.&#13;

TOTAL               18             1,099         677,295&#13;
Beneficiaries. The estimated number of students in the affected districts is 400,000. The program&#13;
would cover about 200,000 students focusing on the hardest hit areas among the 18 districts. The&#13;
students to be targeted are those who are in basic education i.e. in grades 1 to 9 in the 18 districts&#13;
in Southern, Eastem and Western Provinces. The age group is from 6 to 16 years. The project&#13;
should include some component of food ration to teachers as well. Girls should be especially&#13;
targeted because they are likely to be the most affected by the hunger situation as the families&#13;
would turn to the girls first to look for food.&#13;
65&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Benefits and risks. School attendance in the affected districts is expected to increase. It is also&#13;
expected that if the high energy protein supplement is provided at the start of school activities, the&#13;
child will also have better concentration and learning than if they were sitting hungry in class.&#13;
Long-term drop out rates may also be reduced. Since this is a new activity, there are also risks to&#13;
the activity. The start-up of the activity may take a long time, diluting its impact on school&#13;
attendance. The contracting of an organization (to be determined) with international experience in&#13;
this type of activity, is a key factor in mitigating this risk. Another risk is that the response from&#13;
households may be unexpectedly large and many children will appear at school, while the school&#13;
authorities are not equipped to handle this influx. The Ministry of Education is being asked to&#13;
assess the need for top-ups to the BESSIP grants to the target schools in order to enable them to&#13;
manage this potential increase in the numbers of children attending school.&#13;
Implementation arrangements. A special interagency committee has been set composing WFP, the&#13;
World Bank, UNICEF and the Ministry of Education and others that will examine the modalities&#13;
of implementing this scheme. The current thinking is that WFP or UNICEF will be the apex&#13;
organization managing this component on behalf of Ministry of Education. The apex organization&#13;
would be responsible for procurement and distribution on behalf of the cooperating partners.&#13;
However this is still under discussion, alternatively Ministry of Education may be able to&#13;
implement the program through its district staff. The apex organization will contract one or two&#13;
large food processing companies to produce and distribute the high energy protein supplement,&#13;
using competitive procurement procedures. This approach will be adopted to accelerate the start-&#13;
up of the activity. The WFP, WHO, and UNICEF will provide nutritional and hygiene standards&#13;
to the high energy protein supplement manufacturers and will also monitor that these standards are&#13;
strictly observed. It may be necessary to contract the distribution to districts and schools to local&#13;
NGOs.&#13;
Unit costs and financing plan. The cost of providing this ration will be at least 20 cents per child&#13;
for 200,000 pupils will be US$4.8 million. Approximate costs for the distribution of food&#13;
supplements is estimated at US$0.2 million. A total of US$30, 000 would be required for the&#13;
studies bringing the total amount of this intervention to US$5.03 million.&#13;
A financing plan will be prepared for the intervention, whereby different donors and agencies are&#13;
expected to contribute resources. It is proposed that the World Bank meet the financing gap from&#13;
the existing BESSIP credit. The high energy protein supplement subcomponent can be financed&#13;
under Bank rules, as long as procurement guidelines acceptable to IDA are observed. The take-&#13;
home ration of food will not be financed by the Bank.&#13;
Scaling up the BESSIP Bursary Program (US$1.5 million)&#13;
Scale and coverage. The existing BESSIP bursary scheme would be expanded to cover 50 percent&#13;
of the affected pupils at primary school level in severely affected sch6oos in the 18 districts during&#13;
the life of the Emergency Drought Recovery Credit. The BESSIP bursary scheme is not expected&#13;
to encounter significant problems in expanding the scheme rapidly to cover many more primary&#13;
school children this year as the mechanism is already in place and PWAS has completed its&#13;
sensitization in these districts.&#13;
Benefits and risks. School attendance in the affected districts is again expected to increase. A risk&#13;
is that the response from households may be unexpectedly large and many children will appear at&#13;
school, while the school authorities are not equipped to handle this influx. The Ministry of&#13;
Education is being asked to assess the need for top-ups to the BESSIP grants to the target schools&#13;
in order to enable them to manage this potential increase in the numbers of children attending&#13;
school.&#13;
Implementation arrangements. A memorandum of understanding has been signed between the&#13;
MCDSS and Ministry of Education for the administration of the bursary scheme. A special&#13;
66&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
committee has been set between the two ministries to oversee the administration of the scheme.&#13;
MCDSS through PWAS has a district and area network through out the country that assist poor&#13;
people. PWAS in conjunction with the heads of schools identify and establish needy children.&#13;
The names are submitted to Ministry of Education for funding. The checks are released to the&#13;
district education offices who in turn buy the school requisites required by the pupil. In case of&#13;
PTA fees, the money is paid directly to the school by the district office. Sensitization of the&#13;
relevant officials both from Ministry of Education, MCDSS and the communities has been&#13;
completed. BESSIP accounts have been opened in all districts making payment much simpler and&#13;
faster. Scaling up of this program would not be a major additional challenge to the Ministry of&#13;
Education.&#13;
Removing critical transport constraints (US$0.85 million)&#13;
Making improvements to the rural road network in key locations in the 38 affected districts using&#13;
labor intensive work methods as well as repair and rehabilitation of some presently unserviceable&#13;
pontoons and bailey bridges at critical river crossings, and repair and rehabilitation of old&#13;
equipment and acquisition of new equipment are important interventions envisaged under this&#13;
emergency mitigation plan. The initiatives would include:&#13;
Repair and rehabilitation of presently unserviceable pontoons. Two pontoons, the 'Zambezi' and&#13;
'Chobe' operating at Kazangula have been diagnosed after inspections carried out in August as irn&#13;
need of urgent repair and rehabilitation. These pontoons provide a vital link for the movement of&#13;
materials from Republic of South Africa to Zambia and also from the inter land to areas of&#13;
Westem Province for which no road access is available. Their present condition constitutes a&#13;
major constraint on the cost effective movement of materials. on traffic has increased the load on&#13;
the pontoons.&#13;
Of the two ferries operating at Shesheke in Westem Province, only one is operationai. The&#13;
operational ferry is water-logged, requires new engines, repair to loading ramps, lifting arms and&#13;
winches, etc.&#13;
Install bailey bridges at critical river crossings. About 23 baileys are in various locations in the&#13;
country awaiting installation. Designs for their installations have been done. It is recommended&#13;
that DMMU, WFP and the Roads Department meet to determine priority locations for the location&#13;
of these bridges in view of the emergency situation. Installations can be carried out using military&#13;
personnel especially where they need to be relocated from their present site. A total of 18 of these&#13;
are projected to be installed in response to the emergency.&#13;
Four bridges in Southem and Western Provinces have been identified as needing to be&#13;
rehabilitated to prevent their collapse. This work will help to keep open critical road sections used&#13;
for the movement of relief materials. The bridges are in Muyanda in Choma district; Kalobo in&#13;
Mazabuka district; Matabele in Senanga district and Luanja in Sesheke district.&#13;
There are about 26 tractors that have been inspected and classified as repairable. These are owned&#13;
by the government and were procured during the last emergency. They are under the management&#13;
of the WFP in various districts. They are essential to addressing the critical problem of moving&#13;
relief materials from the district headquarters to beneficiaries, especially in the flat flood plains&#13;
and valleys of Western, Southern and Eastem provinces.&#13;
These are needed to augment the 26 old tractors with new tractors to ensure that each of the&#13;
affected districts will have at least one tractor available.&#13;
Undertake track beds strengthening (ballast and sleeper replacement) and purchase spare parts for&#13;
wagons. This intervention will allow track bed strengthening to be carried at known locations&#13;
67&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
between Kasala in the south and the copperbelt where trains are prone to derailment, the purchase&#13;
of derailment jack and repair of wagons to improve their operational safety.&#13;
The proposed interventions can be started immediately upon approval and completed by January&#13;
2003 prior to commencement of the concessioning agreement. The detail cost breakdown is as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Rolling stock              Procurement of wagon wheel discs  US$80,000&#13;
Procurement of wagon brake system  US$80,000&#13;
Procurement of one derailment jack  US$90,000&#13;
Track bed improvement Procurement of 30,000 wooden sleepers  US$450,000&#13;
Procurement of tarpaulins        US$100,000&#13;
Total budget                                                US$850,000&#13;
Financing of spare parts, equipment and construction materials will be through the positive list of&#13;
imports, and the US$850, 000 for railways will come from on going IDA-supported project.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7: Portfolio Assessment - Alignment and Reallocation Options&#13;
The Bank has undertaken a portfolio review to determine additional/complimentary sources of&#13;
funding to the Emergency Drought Recovery Project, to support drought mitigation and recovery&#13;
activities. The projects, which have implementation capacity, experience in, related areas and&#13;
which would not require processing time in amending Development Credit Agreements were&#13;
identified. Zambia's portfolio consists of 12 active projects. Although there is un-disbursed&#13;
balance (US$225.69 million) under the current portfolio, a large portion (80-85 percent) of these&#13;
funds are committed especially under infrastructure projects such as National Road Rehabilitation&#13;
Program (ROADSIP), Power Rehabilitation, Railways, Mine Township Project, ERIPTA, which&#13;
supports the privatization process as well as Zambia Social Investment Fund which supports a&#13;
demand led approach to community development.&#13;
The following projects: Basic Education Sector Investment Program (BESSIP), ZAMSIF,&#13;
Environment Support Project (ESP) and Public Sector Capacity Building Program (PSCAP) could&#13;
support drought mitigation and recovery activities up to US$27.5 million through internal&#13;
reallocation of resources within these projects. These projects are most suitable for reallocation&#13;
due to their: (i) previous experience in targeted safety net activities; (ii) their ability to scale up or&#13;
modify existing programs rapidly; and (iii) implementation capacity. After further consultation&#13;
with the implementing agencies and supervising ministries, the Government has decided to use&#13;
about US$21 million for safety net interventions in support of the ERDP financed activities.&#13;
BESSIP: Funds from this credit will support (i) the existing school bursaries program, (ii) a&#13;
targeted emergency supplementary school feeding program, and (iii) a program of water and&#13;
sanitation projects at schools in worst hit districts. These interventions will be implemented by&#13;
Ministry of Community Development and Social Services, Disaster Management and Mitigation&#13;
UnitlWorld Food Program and ZAMSIF, respectively. Total proposed re-allocation under BESSIP&#13;
is US$11.5 million.&#13;
ESP: There is US$3.0 million available under this credit, which can be re-allocated towards&#13;
drought assistance. However, the processing of the re-allocation may require some time as the&#13;
Development Credit Agreement would need to be amended as well as a Board approval obtained.&#13;
PSCAP: This credit supports capacity building in various government agencies thus can be used to&#13;
strengthen the immediate implementation arrangements of the EDAC as well as provide support&#13;
for longer term capacity building especially in the Ministry of Community Development and&#13;
Social Services and Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit towards improving monitoring and&#13;
coordination of emergency and other safety net programs as well as developing a cohesive, longer&#13;
term social protection strategy for the poor and vulnerable. Activities to this effect would be&#13;
accommodated under the regular operation of this project.&#13;
ROADSIP: The National Roads Board, the implementing agency for the ROADSIP, will be&#13;
coordinating the labor-intensive public works program to be implemented by several agencies&#13;
including ZAMSIF and one or more NGOs in the worst affected districts. This program will be&#13;
providing cash assistance to unskilled laborers from very poor and drought affected communities&#13;
that the works will be implemented at. The program will be drawing on NRB's expertise on road&#13;
maintenance works as well as supervision, financial management and monitoring capacity. Thus,&#13;
even though the public works program will be funded under the EDAC, the ROADSIP program&#13;
will be realigned to respond to the drought emergency.&#13;
ZAMSIF: Using its own implementation structures, i.e. district and provincial technical staff,&#13;
ZAMSIF will be also implementing a labor-based public works program in the worst affected&#13;
districts. ZAMSIF and NRB will coordinate on the implementation of the total program. There is&#13;
existing central and local capacity within ZAMSIF in labor based works as it has been&#13;
69&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
implementing the Community Transport Infrastructure portion of the ROADSIP program. The&#13;
program will encourage affected districts to give priority to the implementation of works projects&#13;
(defined by communities), which have high labor content (e.g. road maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation, small dam rehabilitation, drainage, etc) and will facilitate drought relief and&#13;
recovery. For the duration of this program (October 2002-December 2003), unskilled laborers will&#13;
be provided cash assistance and communities where projects are located will not be expected to&#13;
contribute towards project cost.&#13;
ZAMSIF will also be responsible for the implementation of the school water and sanitation&#13;
facilities rehabilitation program to be funded through a re-allocation from BESSIP. ZAMSIF&#13;
already is responsible for implementation of school infrastructure and related facilities under&#13;
BESSIP.&#13;
Railways Restructuring Project: This project will support track beds strengthening (ballast and&#13;
sleeper replacement) and improvements to wagon repairs operations, which is expected to cost&#13;
about 0.85 million.&#13;

            Zambia - Emergency Drought Recovery Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall objectives of the Emergency
            Drought Recovery Project are to assist the Zambian
            Government to maintain key commitments to its economic and
            investment priorities laid out in the Poverty Reduction
            Strategy Paper (PRSP) while meeting the exigencies of the
            food crisis, and to help restore the productive capability
            of the affected people. The project consists of four
            components: 1) quick-disbursing assistance to finance a
            positive list of imports; 2) safety net interventions aimed
            at improving access to food and services by vulnerable
            groups; 3) distribution of agricultural inputs and
            technologies to help farmers restart agriculture; and 4)
            strengthening government's early warning system and
            capacity for disaster mitigation and management. Benefits
            include reducing the hardship caused by the food emergency,
            while helping to maintain investments in health, education,
            and rural infrastructure. The project will enhance the
            capacity of vulnerable groups to access goods and services
            by providing temporary employment and income supplements
            through public works and other targeted interventions. Risks
            derive from limitations in the capacity of the government to
            handle complex issues related to the logistics and
            distribution of food and other critical supplies to
            vulnerable people.
