&amp;#12;&#13;
BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
The Conflict and its Consequences&#13;
1.    Afghanistan is one of the poorest and longest-suffering countries arnong the members of&#13;
the World Bank. An estimated seven million people remain vulnerable to hunger and very large&#13;
numbers are dependent on a massive inflow of food aid. Afghanistan's infrastructure has been&#13;
destroyed or degraded; its human resource base severely depleted; and its social capital eroded.&#13;
State institutions are largely non-functional, and the economy and society have become&#13;
increasingly fragmented.&#13;
2.    The Afghanistan Interim Administration (AIA) has moved quickly to restore basic&#13;
government functions and re-establish international relations. However, expectations among the&#13;
population for a "peace dividend" are high, and if the AIA and its successor do not deliver results&#13;
relatively quickly, the prospects for further progress and the peace process will dim.&#13;
3.    Despite being hampered by very limited capacity and the difficult security situation in&#13;
many parts of the country, the AIA has made considerable progress and has gained widespread&#13;
international recognition. The AIA presented a draft National Development Framework to the&#13;
Interim Donors Group on April 2, 2002, which laid out the AIA's development strategy.&#13;
Features of the Existing Education System&#13;
4.    By any statistical measure, the situation facing the education system in Afghanistan is&#13;
dire. The most informed estimates (UNESCO EFA 2000 report) indicate that Afghanistan's&#13;
education indicators are among the worst in the world, with girls and rural populations&#13;
particularly disadvantaged. The gross enrollment rate is estimated at 43 percent for boys and&#13;
only 3 percent for girls; 80 percent of school buildings at all levels, most teacher training&#13;
colleges, and vocational-technical facilities have been damaged or destroyed. A large number of&#13;
qualified teachers have fled the country, taken jobs outside of education, work in refugee camps,&#13;
or have been killed. The curriculum has not been revised for 30 years, and virtually no modem&#13;
educational practices have been introduced for decades. Most teachers and administrators have&#13;
not been paid for over eight months, and salary levels are set well below a living wage. In&#13;
summary, the education system has very limited capacity to supply basic inputs, i.e., buildings,&#13;
teachers, materials, and textbooks.&#13;
5.    Participation in secondary education is extremely low, seriously limiting the capacity of&#13;
the system to produce skilled professionals and informed leadership. While reliable enrollment&#13;
data for secondary education levels do not exist yet, estimates for 2001 range from 220,000 to&#13;
300,000, or roughly 5-11% of the school age population. No recent information is available on&#13;
the number of students per secondary grade, nor on survival rates through grade 12. In 1993,&#13;
roughly 3 students per 100 enrolled in grade 1 completed the 12th grade. At the end of 2001, the&#13;
number of girls enrolled in secondary grades countrywide was close to nil: the Taliban&#13;
authorities had closed all of the limited available girls' schools.&#13;
6.    The attendance rate in tertiary education is among the lowest in the world over a period&#13;
of at least 30 years. In 1995, only 2% of the population over 25 years of age had any tertiary&#13;
I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
education, while the average is 5.7% worldwide. Higher education in Afghanistan is mainly&#13;
provided by five universities, fourteen teacher training colleges and a small number of&#13;
polytechnics and institutes. There is a near total lack of equipment, teaching and learning&#13;
materials and furniture in most institutions. The institutional capacity in tertiary education has&#13;
been depleted by brain drain, and a permanent lack of resources has prevented those&#13;
professionals remaining in the country to participate in national and international academic&#13;
networks and pedagogical developments related to teaching and learning.&#13;
7.    Pre-service teacher training is largely defunct, while some in-service teacher training has&#13;
been provided, primarily by NGOs and other agencies. A large number of qualified teachers have&#13;
fled the country, taken jobs outside of education, work in refugee camps, or have been killed.&#13;
8.    While females' participation rates in secondary education and tertiary education have&#13;
been historically lower than boys', the gender gap has reached unprecedented heights since 1995.&#13;
Of an estimated 21,000 teachers who staff government and NGO-run primary education schools,&#13;
only 12% are females. Most female teachers work outside of government schools in schools&#13;
supported by NGOs and home-based schools. Only about half of all primary education teachers&#13;
have completed grade 12, the official minimum qualification.&#13;
9.    Management of the system is highly centralized, with few qualified educators, managers,&#13;
administrators, planners or technicians. There is a complete absence of any information-&#13;
communication technology, with no computers in the two main education ministries.&#13;
Institutional capacity in the ministries is extremely weak, with limited experience in planning,&#13;
setting of priorities, and system management. Issues of language and curriculum content will&#13;
need to be addressed once mechanisms for policy development have been set in place, ensuring&#13;
broad-based consultation with civil society.&#13;
10.   An estimated 400,000 children, one-third of the total Afghan children in primary school,&#13;
attend NGO-run schools and an estimated 170,000 refugee children are enrolled in UN-&#13;
supported camps in Pakistan. An unknown number attend regular schools in Iran, madrassas,&#13;
home schools, and other alternative venues. It is difficult to predict how many refugees and&#13;
Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) will return, and whether they will return to their place of&#13;
origin. Returning families whose children have started education will want them to continue, and&#13;
many other families will want a fresh opportunity for their children.&#13;
11.   The lack of opportunities for education and the disruption caused by war, migration, and&#13;
economic hardship have created entire generations with limited or disrupted education. There is&#13;
an urgent need for technical and vocational education to provide skills for national&#13;
reconstruction, and to assist the insertion of youth, women, ex-combatants and others into the&#13;
labor force. There are approximately 300,000 war widows in Kabul alone, most of whom lack&#13;
basic skills for sustaining livelihood. The number of children, youth, and young adults whose&#13;
education was disrupted is estimated at nine million. Some of them need to complete their&#13;
primary schooling, while others need to complete secondary school or university to be eligible&#13;
for many occupations. All of these groups require educational services that are tailored to their&#13;
particular needs.&#13;
12.   In order to achieve an 85 percent Net Enrollment Rate (NER) within 10 years, using a&#13;
very conservative estimate of a constant school age population of 4.5 million children, an&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
additional 43,500 teachers and 13,851 schools are required. The recurrent costs implied in such&#13;
an expansion are large by any measure. The budgetary impact will be even greater if teacher&#13;
salaries are increased to a living wage. In short, new approaches to education must be found -&#13;
both for the immediate needs and for the future.&#13;
13.   While the challenges the education system faces are enormous, there is a prevailing&#13;
atmosphere of excitement, expectation, and determination in schools and communities&#13;
throughout the country. Despite an almost total lack of resources and teacher salary arrears of&#13;
more than six months, thousands of Afghan teachers and students are registering for classes,&#13;
congregating in schools weeks before they open, helping with repairs and feeding on the&#13;
excitement of being able to have schools again. Parents are keen to return the children to school.&#13;
The most common estimate of school age children is 4.5 million. The girls' schools that opened&#13;
for informal winter sessions in all parts of the country after the defeat of the Taliban are&#13;
overflowing. At the University of Kabul, over 18,000 students took the admissions exam. This&#13;
commitment to education at all levels will be an important force in rebuilding the system.&#13;
GOVERNMENT STRATEGY: FROM EMERGENCY TO DEVELOPMENT&#13;
14.   The emergency education program encompasses all priority areas that require immediate&#13;
attention to get the education system up and running. This includes rehabilitation of schools,&#13;
textbooks, teacher training, capacity building, and recurrent costs (salaries and operating costs).&#13;
The program also supports the efforts needed to initiate policy and structural reforms, thus&#13;
guaranteeing the sector's sustainability in the recovering economy of Afghanistan.&#13;
15.   A two-year recovery program for the Education Sector in Afghanistan, estimated at&#13;
US$225 million, has been submitted for consideration to the international donor community. The&#13;
program is based on the Comprehensive Needs Assessment (CNA) carried out in&#13;
February/March 2002 by the AIA and a number of donors, including IDA. There is an estimated&#13;
US$130 million in available financing under the emergency program, leaving a financing gap of&#13;
approximately US$95 million, or 45% of total requirements over the next two years. Among sub-&#13;
sectors, the tertiary sub-sector is relatively under-subscribed for donor support, whereas the&#13;
primary sub-sector is relatively better off, particularly for physical rehabilitation of schools and&#13;
to support girls' enrollment and participation. Appendix III shows the funding gap by sub-sector.&#13;
16.   The following table shows the major activities under the program, indicative financing by&#13;
donor, as well as the financing gap. In addition to the proposed IDA Grant of US$15.0 million,&#13;
the indicative funds for IDA include $4.1 million which has been requested from the Japan&#13;
Social Development Fund (JSDF).&#13;

IDA ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
Afghanistan's Relations with IDA&#13;
17.   Afghanistan is a member of IDA, IFC, IMF, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).&#13;
Afghanistan became a member of the IMF and World Bank in 1955. IDA has provided 21&#13;
development credits to Afghanistan since 1964 in a wide range of sectors including education,&#13;
roads and agricultural activities. Of the original US$230 million approved by IDA for&#13;
Afghanistan, US$83 million was disbursed and US$147 million was subsequently canceled. IDA&#13;
operations were suspended shortly after the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the&#13;
Resident Mission in Kabul was closed. Afghanistan has repaid US$9.2 million to IDA and was&#13;
up-to-date on debt service payments until June 1992, when the country went into non-accrual&#13;
status. Lending operations remained suspended due to the continuing fighting, absence of a&#13;
national govermment, and Afghanistan's entry into non-accrual status with IDA.&#13;
18.   Afghanistan's Arrears to International Financial Institutions (IFI. Resuming normal&#13;
financial relations with the IFIs will require Afghanistan to clear outstanding arrears which total,&#13;
as of January 31, 2002, around US$51 million including US$25.2 million to IDA, about US$16&#13;
million to the ADB, and US$9.8 million to the IMF. The AIA is committed to clearing its arrears&#13;
to IDA by the end of the summer 2002, which will set the stage for a resumption of regular&#13;
lending from the IFIs.&#13;
19.   IDA has not extended any credits to Afghanistan since 1979, although it has remained&#13;
engaged with the assistance community. Efforts have included continuous monitoring of&#13;
political and economic developments; managing selective investments in the Afghan refugee&#13;
communities; working closely with the UN and donors; undertaking knowledge-building and&#13;
knowledge-sharing activities; and providing analytical and strategic depth for the work of the&#13;
wider assistance community.!&#13;
The Transitional Support Strategy&#13;
20.   IDA's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS), which was presented to the Board with the&#13;
Emergency Public Administration Project, is predicated on the need for well-coordinated efforts&#13;
by Afghanistan's development partners to realize Afghanistan's reconstruction and development&#13;
priorities. The key objectives of IDA's assistance over the next six to nine months are to assist&#13;
the authorities in establishing capacity in areas essential to facilitate the reconstruction program;&#13;
and to support high-priority reconstruction activities that can also help jump-start economic&#13;
activity. In the near term, IDA's engagement with the AIA is likely to be mainly at the central&#13;
level, until such time when there is effective decision-making at the sub-national level, and the&#13;
countrywide security situation improves. Consequently, to deliver assistance outside of Kabul, it&#13;
will be vital to utilize the experiences and networks of NGOs and UN agencies, and to develop&#13;
mechanisms to channel funds directly to community groups or traditional governance structures.&#13;
21.   Assistance to Afghanistan, for both recurrent and capital expenditures, is likely to be&#13;
received from various donors and delivered through a variety of mechanisms. Hence, aid&#13;
See Afghanistan: World BankApproach Paper, November 2001 for more details.&#13;
5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
coordination will be essential to ensure a comprehensive and unified budget that is in line with&#13;
agreed national priorities. One mechanism to assist in such coordinated funding is the multi-&#13;
donor, IDA-administered Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) that will provide&#13;
financing for priority expenditures including recurrent costs. Donor funding for recurrent&#13;
expenditures, including wage payments, is an essential element of the support needed since the&#13;
scope for own-revenue collection is now very limited.&#13;
Rationale for IDA Involvement in the Education Sector&#13;
22.   The AIA, IDA and other donors are developing a Comprehensive Development&#13;
Framework (CDF) to meet the needs of the education sector. Under this approach, and as a first&#13;
step to a CDF, a programmatic approach for identifying funding requirements has been prepared.&#13;
Specifically, in order to delineate short-, medium- and long-term investment requirements and&#13;
plans, a series of joint donor needs assessments have been undertaken, resulting in a consolidated&#13;
analysis of investment requirements and indicative funding for key activities across sub-sectors&#13;
(primary, secondary, tertiary, non-formal, technical/skills development).&#13;
23.   In light of the very serious situation facing the education sector, there has been a&#13;
concerted effort by donors participating in the needs assessment to ensure that inputs are&#13;
appropriately sequenced, balancing both the urgency of providing some specific inputs for&#13;
allowing education service delivery to get underway, and laying the foundation, at an early stage,&#13;
for the medium- and longer-term need for sound policy and planning processes to be set in place.&#13;
This approach attempts to maximize complementarity of inputs and the comparative advantages&#13;
of each assisting agency. However, based on this approach, it appears that the primary and&#13;
secondary sectors are relatively over-subscribed by donors, whereas tertiary education and&#13;
vocational and skills development are under-subscribed (see Appendix III).&#13;
24.   The investment strategy recommended by the joint donor Comprehensive Needs&#13;
Assessment reflects an overall strategy of: (i) supporting rapid expansion of education services&#13;
where demand is greatest through the flexible and efficient use of multiple delivery systems&#13;
(government, NGO, private sector), while (ii) building the capacity of sector institutions to plan&#13;
for and implement reconstruction of the system. In this respect, ADB, the Islamic Development&#13;
Bank (IDB) and a number of bilateral donors are funding rehabilitation and construction of&#13;
primary and secondary schools, and related institution capacity-building. UNICEF and USAID&#13;
are funding the Back-to-School Program, which provides training, materials, and other quality&#13;
inputs to primary and secondary schools. For IDA, it was agreed that support to policy&#13;
formulation, capacity building, ECD, NFE, technical and vocational training, tertiary education,&#13;
and internet communications and distance learning facilities are priorities.&#13;
25.   IDA's extensive global experience in supporting these types of interventions in&#13;
development, post-conflict and emergency situations provides a comparative advantage for its&#13;
assistance. IDA's priority is to ensure that sector development takes place through the&#13;
establishment of a sound policy framework through a process of extensive civil society&#13;
consultation and, especially, the full participation of women. This is particularly important at the&#13;
tertiary level where it is essential to rebuild a cadre of professionals and leaders to meet the&#13;
needs of a modem Afghanistan. Additionally, it is essential to ensure that after more than two&#13;
decades of relative isolation, decision-makers in Afghanistan have the benefit of IDA's&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
understanding of global good practices for supporting equity, quality, access and accountability&#13;
in education system building and reform.&#13;
26.   The Afghanistan education strategy has been developed following careful analysis and&#13;
assessment of lessons learned through IDA's involvement in both Bosnia and East Timor, and&#13;
elsewhere, over recent years. It also draws upon the extensive knowledge and experience of other&#13;
development partners in specific areas -- such as UNICEF in the field of ECD and international&#13;
NGOs in the field NFE -- where IDA can provide immediate support that might otherwise not be&#13;
available. There has been an intensive process of consultation within IDA to maximize&#13;
consistency in approach with other sectoral inputs, particularly for Community Driven&#13;
Development (CDD) and the coordination of support at local and community levels.&#13;
THE PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
Project Objectives and Components&#13;
27.   The overall objective of the Project is to selectively support the Government of&#13;
Afghanistan's emergency education program. Specifically, the Project will help: (a) increase&#13;
access to education opportunities in the formal and non-fornal systems for under-served groups,&#13;
especially women and girls; (b) reform education management at all levels, in partnership with&#13;
civil society, NGOs and the private sector; and (c) introduce modern information technologies&#13;
for communications and distance learning.&#13;
28.   To achieve the above project objectives, the Project will include the following&#13;
components:&#13;
29.   Component 1: Promoting Skills Development and Learning (estimated cost US$5.8&#13;
million equivalent. including contingencies): The aim of this component is to support those who&#13;
have not been able to access education opportunities over recent years. This includes:&#13;
(i)   Youth aged 13-24 years who lack basic literacy, including those with young&#13;
children who would benefit from ECD activities;&#13;
(ii)  Disadvantaged primary and secondary school-aged girls, and young women at the&#13;
tertiary education level; and&#13;
(iii)  Under-served groups, including war widows and ex-combatants, who require&#13;
basic skills development training for sustained livelihood and participation in&#13;
society.&#13;
30.   The component targets those who have not been able to access education using both the&#13;
formal and non-formal systems of education to promote learning and skills acquisition. In&#13;
particular, it recognizes the proven social and economic advantages of educating young mothers&#13;
and preparing young children for future learning. This component comprises three sub-&#13;
components:&#13;
Literacy Learning and ECD (estimated cost US$1.1 million equivalent). This sub-component&#13;
will address the literacy and basic education requirements of youth aged 13-24 years, with&#13;
a particular focus on young women and adolescent girls, through non-formal classes for&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
literacy acquisition. To provide young children with early learning opportunities, ECD&#13;
activities will be linked to women's participation in NFE programs, and analyze the needs&#13;
of young children, women, families and communities will be assessed in order to develop&#13;
an ECD policy and a national program of NFE.&#13;
Increasing the Number of Girls in School (estimated cost US$3.7 million equivalent). To&#13;
promote girls' and young women's participation in the formal system of education at the&#13;
primary, secondary and tertiary levels, a demand-side financing mechanism will encourage:&#13;
(i) girls and young women to enroll in, and complete, a course of study at a secondary or&#13;
tertiary-level institution of their choice through a capitation payment scheme; and (ii)&#13;
children, especially girls of disadvantaged women, including war widows, to participate in&#13;
primary or secondary schooling through a stipend scheme paid in cash or in-kind to their&#13;
families.&#13;
Skills Development for Underserved Groups (estimated cost US$1.0 million equivalent). To&#13;
provide demand-driven skills development training to allow disadvantaged groups,&#13;
including war widows and ex-combatants, opportunities for sustained livelihood and&#13;
participation in society through the acquisition of new skills. It will support the training of&#13;
instructors, rehabilitation of facilities, the provision of materials, textbooks, reference&#13;
materials and training modules and learner stipends. Community centers offering technical&#13;
and vocational training consisting of short-term courses in urgently required skills will be&#13;
supported.&#13;
31.   Component 2: Education Sector Management Reform (estimated cost US$5.7 million&#13;
equivalent, including contingencies!: The aim of this component is to develop capacities to&#13;
enable the effective design and management of the primary, secondary and tertiary education&#13;
sub-sectors. Key partners in this are civil society, NGOs, and the private sector. This component&#13;
includes two sub-components:&#13;
Policy Development for the Education Sector (estimated cost US$1.0 million equivalent). This&#13;
sub-component will develop a new sector policy framework, based on principles including,&#13;
among others, social and gender equity, access and quality, as agreed during consultations&#13;
between AIA and the multi-donor assessment mission of February 2002. The policy&#13;
framework will include the definition of standards and qualifications of teachers,&#13;
curriculum requirements, assessment of learning outcomes, and accreditation, as well as&#13;
regulatory guidelines for the functioning of NGOs and private providers. This sub-&#13;
component will support an institutional analysis and sector work to gain in-depth&#13;
knowledge of the sector and development requirements. A baseline survey, providing&#13;
information about basic human development indicators and allowing for measurement of&#13;
the impact of policy and sector restructuring on outcomes, will also fall under this sub-&#13;
component. Efforts will be made under the sub-component to provide greater access for&#13;
women in policy and decision-making. In addition, the MOE will support the&#13;
Government's work in carrying out a proposed Living Standard Measurement Survey&#13;
(LSMS) which will provide the Government and other stakeholders with critical data and&#13;
analysis to formulate policy in Afghanistan.&#13;
Skills Development for Quality Schools and Institutions (estimated cost US$4.7 million&#13;
equivalent). This sub-component will address the urgent skills capacity building&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
requirements at all levels of the education system and provide the necessary material&#13;
support for its functioning. Particular emphasis will be placed on strengthening public-&#13;
private partnerships, the role of districts and communities, and the establishment of Village&#13;
Education Committees (VECs) to support the on-going functioning and improvement of&#13;
schools. The component will also address rehabilitation of the tertiary sub-sector starting&#13;
with support to tertiary institutes and priority disciplines to address their most immediate&#13;
needs to upgrade the quality of teaching and learning.&#13;
32.   Component 3: Distance Learning and Communications (estimated cost US$3.5 million&#13;
equivalent, including contingencies): The aim of this component is twofold: (i) to help strengthen&#13;
the capacity of the Government of Afghanistan and the AACA through the use of information&#13;
and communications technology to accelerate planning, implementation, and monitoring of the&#13;
reconstruction process; and (ii) to provide a facility for distance learning which will support the&#13;
management reform and capacity building processes of Component 2. This will foster&#13;
knowledge transfer of global experience and good practice while allowing key personnel to stay&#13;
on the job during this critical period of rebuilding.&#13;
Establishment of a Distance Learning Center (DLC) (estimated cost US$1.7 million equivalent).&#13;
The Project will support the establishment of the DLC within the AACA offices and linked&#13;
to the University of Kabul, through provision of appropriate tools and programs to support&#13;
the public sector skills capacity building for the future Afghan government. This will&#13;
provide a delivery mechanism for capacity building to improve education management at&#13;
the central, provincial and district levels of the MOE and MOHE, and for increased local&#13;
level access to education management-related information and skills development, as per&#13;
Component 2.&#13;
Development of a Government Internet (estimated cost US$1.8 million equivalent). This sub-&#13;
component will address communications requirements through the provision of a basic set&#13;
of telecommunications, office and networking technology, including internet connectivity&#13;
and supporting applications for a priority set of AIA Ministries.&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
33.   The Project will be implemented by three agencies: Ministry of Education (MOE),&#13;
Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) and the Afghanistan Assistance Coordination Authority&#13;
(AACA), under the responsibility of the respective ministers and in close collaboration with&#13;
NGOs, universities and provincial and local authorities and communities. Components 1 and 2&#13;
will be implemented by MOE and MOHE and Component 3 by the AACA.&#13;
34.   Because these activities support a programmatic approach to the rehabilitation and&#13;
development of the education system, overall coordination of the project will be with the Deputy&#13;
Chairperson, AIA, with oversight responsibilities for the education portfolio. The Deputy&#13;
Chairperson, AIA, who is currently the Minister of Women's Affairs, will establish a Steering&#13;
Committee to include the Ministers of MOE and MOHE, and the Director of the AACA. This&#13;
Steering Committee will be supported by a technical unit working closely with the three&#13;
agencies. Day-to-day management and implementation of project activities will be the&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
responsibilities of the respective line ministries and line directorates within those ministries. The&#13;
line directorates will also ensure coordination of all other activities being carried out by other&#13;
development partners, to ensure efficient use of resources. Project reporting will be done through&#13;
the Steering Committee technical unit. The Steering Committee, as part of its coordination&#13;
function, will hold quarterly meetings with all project stakeholders. Because the Project&#13;
emphasizes capacity building, the MOE and MOHE in addition, will identify and appoint an&#13;
adequate number of Government staff counterparts with requisite technical qualifications to&#13;
implement the Project.&#13;
Summary of Implementation Arrangements&#13;
35.   Component 1: Promoting Skills Development and Learning: This component will be&#13;
implemented through contracting arrangements with experienced lead NGOs who have, over the&#13;
last several years, carried out literacy and ECD programs in Afghanistan, in close collaboration&#13;
with local communities. Existing programs will be scaled up to expand literacy training coverage&#13;
for youth aged 13-24 years. In addition, these lead NGOs will be contracted to provide technical&#13;
assistance to smaller national NGOs, including the training of literacy instructors. NGOs&#13;
implementing literacy programs for youth will also provide early childcare facilities, activities&#13;
and appropriate instructional and play materials for the young children of the literacy learners.&#13;
Technical support to be funded by the project to develop ECD literacy material for use in classes&#13;
focusing on home-based early child development approaches.&#13;
36.   To develop a policy framework for ECD, the project will provide technical, financial and&#13;
material assistance to the NFE section of the MOE to organize and carry out workshops on&#13;
international good practices in ECD.&#13;
37.   A capitation system for eligible girls and women at the secondary and tertiary education&#13;
levels will be introduced which will allow them to choose a secondary or tertiary institute for&#13;
study. Capitation payments will be made to the institute at the completion of a girl's program of&#13;
study, based on the establishment of baseline levels for girls' enrollment and paid according to&#13;
incremental increases. A separate stipend scheme to assist children, especially girls, of&#13;
disadvantaged women, including war widows, will be paid in cash or in-kind to families through&#13;
a verification system to be established.&#13;
38.   Technical and vocational training for disadvantaged groups will be carried out by&#13;
competent NGOs with a proven track record in this area. It will be based on a analysis of demand&#13;
for skills training and organized through linkages to industry and private business to foster&#13;
employment and self-employment opportunities after training.&#13;
39.   Contracting of NGOs for the expansion of literacy and technical and vocational programs&#13;
will take place immediately after effectiveness.&#13;
40.   Component 2: Education Sector Management Reform: In order to carry out this&#13;
component, it will be essential that the MOE and MOHE identify a critical number of qualified&#13;
civil servants who would be prepared to take on additional responsibilities, decision-making&#13;
authority and be held accountable for meeting key performance targets. This can be understood&#13;
as a 'Core Development Team' (CDT). Since CDT staff will be civil servants, salaries will not&#13;
be financed from the Grant.&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41.   It is anticipated that this core group of civil servants will require additional support in a&#13;
number of key areas, such as policy development, planning, financial management, monitoring&#13;
and evaluation, and various technical functions within the education sector. For the MOE and&#13;
MOHE, it is recommended that this core group not exceed 20 persons per ministry.&#13;
42.   For development of the policy framework and sector analyses, the project will provide&#13;
technical assistance for the establishment of a Steering Committee chaired by the Deputy&#13;
Chairperson responsible for the education portfolio and the Ministers from MOE and MOHE,&#13;
with representation of major stakeholders from civil society including women's and parents'&#13;
associations. Additional specialized technical assistance will be provided for selected units&#13;
within the ministries, such as the Primary, Secondary, NFE, Technical/Vocational, Planning,&#13;
Assessment/Accreditation, Curriculum and Teacher Training departments. The project will&#13;
provide technical, financial and material support for a number of workshops and civil society&#13;
consultations on policy to be held at the regional, provincial and community levels. The technical&#13;
assistance contract is expected to be in place by September 2002.&#13;
43.   For developing core skills in sectoral line directorates, technical assistance will be&#13;
procured to design an on-the-job training program while supporting the day-to-day work of core&#13;
staff at the central and provincial levels. Funds will also be available to procure short-term&#13;
training through the DLC.&#13;
44.   A small number of vehicles will be procured to provide mobility in provincial ministry&#13;
offices, particularly to address the transport requirements of personnel in areas that are remote or&#13;
difficult to reach. Computers, related IT support, and basic office equipment and supplies at the&#13;
central and provincial levels will be funded from this sub-component through the procurement&#13;
arrangements described in Appendix I.&#13;
45.   For developing decentralized management structures, particularly at the community level,&#13;
the project will support the establishment of VECs under the umbrella of the proposed CDD&#13;
Project. A pilot scheme will be carried out during the first twelve months of the project targeting&#13;
100 villages. This will be designed and implemented through a contract with a qualified NGO&#13;
with extensive experience in community participation in education. Following a successful pilot&#13;
phase, this will be scaled-up to 500 villages during the second year of project implementation.&#13;
46.   For improved district-level monitoring of schools for supporting quality teaching-&#13;
learning, a lead NGO with a successful track record of providing quality inputs will be&#13;
contracted. The procurement of basic office equipment and supplies for district level ministry&#13;
offices will be funded from this sub-component through the procurement arrangements described&#13;
in Appendix I, with priority given to those districts which are being supported by an NGO for&#13;
improved monitoring of schools.&#13;
47.   Sub-Grants, i.e., block grants, for a maximum amount of US$100,000 each will be&#13;
awarded to tertiary-level institutes addressing the most immediate needs of institutes and priority&#13;
disciplines. Grants to institutes will be awarded by a management committee following approval&#13;
by the President and two faculty deans. A Management Committee will make site visits to&#13;
validate proposals prior to the release of funds, and seek agreements on milestones for which&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
disbursements will take place. All proposals from institutes will be submitted collectively in&#13;
order to streamline procurement of goods and services.&#13;
48.   Expenditure categories to be financed by block grants are: (a) technical assistance; (b)&#13;
books; (c) computers; (d) laboratory equipment; (e) short-term training in Afghanistan and South&#13;
Asia; (f) civil works; (g) vehicles; and (h) furniture. Excluded for funding are: (a) long-term&#13;
fellowships abroad; (b) construction of new buildings; and (c) establishment of new institutions.&#13;
The block grants will be implemented in line with the agreed criteria shown in Appendix IV.&#13;
49.   Support will also be available for the physical rehabilitation of men's and women's hostel&#13;
facilities (one each) for a maximum of US$150,000 each.&#13;
50.   Component 3: Distance Learning and Communications: The AACA is responsible for&#13;
implementation of this component. The component will provide a basic set of&#13;
telecommunications, office and networking technology, Internet connectivity and supporting&#13;
applications, including The Afghanistan Reconstruction Gateway (ARG), for a priority set of&#13;
AIA Ministries. The Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN) DLC and Government intranet&#13;
will form an integrated program, and will be located in the headquarters of the newly established&#13;
AACA with an intent to link to University of Kabul. The site meets GDLN minimum standards,&#13;
and the UNDP has agreed to finance and implement site renovation, including furniture.&#13;
Renovation work has begun, and is expected to be completed by early June 2002. Because the&#13;
AACA currently does not have the capacity to deliver the GDLN and Government Intranet&#13;
components, the Bank technical staff will assist in delivering and building local capacity to&#13;
sustain these investments.&#13;
51.   The Project will finance operating costs of the DLC for two years, including connectivity,&#13;
local staff and staff training. Content for the distance learning program will be developed in line&#13;
with the needs assessments and the proposed technical assistance component of the IDA grant&#13;
program. The AACA has issued a note to the donor community explaining the component and its&#13;
relationship to ongoing work by the UN agencies to establish communication between those&#13;
agencies and the AIA.&#13;
52.   Equipment needs will include the provision of local infrastructure equipment, local and&#13;
global connectivity equipment, pedagogical tools, and logistical support. Provision will be made&#13;
for training in telecommunications and distance learning for DLC staff. Programming&#13;
requirements for the DLC, including programmers, software, translation, and specialized&#13;
equipment and materials will be covered, along with operational costs, including satellite&#13;
capacity, local staff salaries, technical training and operating materials and supplies.&#13;
53.   The priority ministries and agencies benefiting from a government internet will initially&#13;
include: AACA, Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and&#13;
Reconstruction, Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Higher Education, Ministry of Education, and&#13;
the University of Kabul. Financing will cover technical assistance, training, computer and&#13;
telecommunications equipment and software applications, and operating costs and supplies.&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Procurement, Financial Management, Disbursement and Audit Arrangements 2&#13;
54.   Procurement Arrangements: Procurement responsibility under the Project will be carried&#13;
out by a specialized firm (Procurement Agent) contracted specifically under AACA to work on&#13;
behalf of and in cooperation with the AACA and line ministries. This arrangement of having a&#13;
specialized firm in place as early as possible will ensure compliance with IDA procurement&#13;
procedures from the outset, and expedite implementation of project activities. Appendix I&#13;
provides more detailed information on procurement arrangements.&#13;
55.   Procurement, financial management and audit functions for the proposed Project will be&#13;
undertaken through the umbrella contract which is supported by the recently approved IDA-&#13;
financed Emergency Public Administration Project. Under this contract, three Agents -&#13;
Procurement, Financial Management and Audit - are responsible for carrying out these core&#13;
technical assistance functions on behalf of the AIA. Specifically, the Procurement Agent will&#13;
review and approve all major contracts. The implementing agencies would provide technical&#13;
input into the process; however, they would not be responsible for any procurement actions&#13;
during the course of the project. To ensure that domestic capacity is built up, the Procurement&#13;
Agent will provide training to key counterpart staff in the other line ministries, including, in the&#13;
case of the proposed Project, the MOE and MOHE, as deemed necessary to ensure that they&#13;
develop capacity to eventually carry out procurement on their own.&#13;
56.   Financial Management. Disbursement and Audit Arrangements: Financial management&#13;
and audit functions for the proposed project will be undertaken through the Agents to be&#13;
contracted under the recently approved IDA financed Emergency Public Administration Project.&#13;
Under these contracts, two Agents - Financial Management and Audit - are responsible for&#13;
working with the AIA line ministries to carry out these core functions.&#13;
57.   The Financial Management Agent (FMA) is responsible for assisting the MOF to&#13;
maintain the accounts for all public expenditures, including IDA-financed projects, including the&#13;
proposed Project, in addition to building capacity within AIA for these functions. The AiA's&#13;
budgeting and accounting systems will be used. Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports will be&#13;
prepared by the line ministries' accounting units. The consolidated Project reports will be&#13;
prepared, reviewed and approved by the MOF, supported by the FMA.&#13;
58.   The Special Account, with an initial deposit of US$1.5 million equivalent will be opened&#13;
in the Bank of Afghanistan (central bank) in the name of the Project on terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to IDA. The Special Account will be maintained by the MOF. Withdrawal&#13;
applications for replenishment will be submitted monthly.&#13;
59.   Funds Flow: The project will use the existing system as much as possible. As is the&#13;
practice for public expenditure, all project payments will be routed through the Ministry of&#13;
Finance (MOF). The FM Agent to be appointed will assist the MOF in executing and recording&#13;
project payments.&#13;
60.   Treasury officials at the MOF will be the authorized persons to operate the USD Special&#13;
Account of the project at the Da Afghanistan Bank (the Central Bank - DAB); IDA funds will be&#13;
2 Appendix I includes detailed description of procurement arrangements.&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
deposited into the Special Account. When a project payment is required to be made,&#13;
implementing agencies (i.e., the MOE, MEHE, or University of Kabul) will submit a standard&#13;
payment request to the MOF-Treasury. Treasury officials, after verifying the documents and&#13;
checking the availability of funds in the Special Account and budget will: (a) for payments in&#13;
Afghanis issue a check in Afghanis for encashment at DAB; and (b) for a payment in foreign&#13;
currency instruct DAB to execute the payment.&#13;
61.   For purposes of funds flow planning, it is important that the financial consultants in the&#13;
line ministries and the University of Kabul, FM Agent, MOF Treasury Officials and DAB staff&#13;
closely coordinate, monitor and communicate cash flow requirement for project activities.&#13;
62.   All withdrawal applications to the IDA, including replenishment, reimbursement and&#13;
direct payment applications, will be prepared and submitted by the MOF.&#13;
63.   Due to reasons related to security, damaged infrastructure, and a breakdown in&#13;
communication between the branches and the Kabul office of DAB, the AIA will face a&#13;
challenge in effecting payments throughout the country. Although not all the branches of DAB&#13;
are currently fully functional, efforts are being made to rehabilitate the branches so that the&#13;
payment needs of the AIA throughout the country can be met, including making arrangements&#13;
for secure transport of cash notes around the country. The 30 provincial branches needed for the&#13;
project should be operational prior to disbursements. Salary payments have recently been made&#13;
in 25 of the 32 provinces, and the payment systems are being restarted throughout the country.&#13;
In addition, in the short term, there could be a shortage of Afghani currency notes within the&#13;
government.&#13;
64.   Although the AIA and DAB prefer to use the normal payment systems, in the case that&#13;
DAB cannot provide the payment services in all required locations, the AIA could resort to&#13;
altemative systems (e.g., Hawala) to effect payments in these locations. If the AIA chooses to&#13;
use such an alternative system for the flow of funds on IDA-financed activities, the&#13;
implementation mechanisms and risk mitigation measures will be agreed with IDA prior to the&#13;
flow of funds through the alternative system.&#13;
65.   Disbursement Method. Disbursements from the IDA Grant would be transaction-based&#13;
(replenishment, reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under Special Commitments) with&#13;
full documentation or against statements of expenditures as appropriate).&#13;
66.   Retroactive Financing. Provision has been made to reimburse AIA for payments it&#13;
makes, up to SDR 2.4 million, between April 1, 2002 and Grant signing for Project expenditures.&#13;
67.   Reimbursement to IDA. IDA will reimburse itself from the Grant Account upon Grant&#13;
effectiveness for payments it has made in respect of Distance Learning and Communications&#13;
expenditures (Category 7) up to the SDR equivalent of US$2.3 million.&#13;
68.   Audits. The Auditor General, supported by the Audit Agent, will audit the accounts of all&#13;
IDA-financed projects. Annual audited project financial statements would be submitted within&#13;
six months of the close of AlA's fiscal year.&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
69.   Given the nature of this emergency operation, more frequent supervision missions will be&#13;
necessary to ensure that any obstacles to implementation are overcome expeditiously. At a&#13;
minimum, a full supervision mission is needed quarterly, with specialists visiting more&#13;
frequently if needed during implementation. A mid-term review of the project will be carried out&#13;
in summer of 2003 to evaluate progress and work with Government to make any adjustments&#13;
deemed necessary to reach project objectives.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX I&#13;
PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
Institutional Capacity&#13;
1.    Given the weak institutional capacity of the ministries responsible for implementing the&#13;
proposed Project, as part of an overall management support contract for the Afghanistan&#13;
Recovery Program, a Procurement Agent will work on behalf of, and closely with, the staff of&#13;
the AACA and the line ministries. The Procurement Agent will be responsible for procurement&#13;
of goods, works and consultancy services, and for building capacity within the AACA and the&#13;
line ministries. Under the IDA-financed Emergency Public Administration Project, which has&#13;
just been approved by the Bank's Board of Directors, IDA would finance both the Procurement&#13;
Agent and the training of key AACA staff in IDA procurement guidelines and procedures.&#13;
2.    The procurement risk for this project is high, because of the post-conflict environment in&#13;
Afghanistan, despite the fact that a Procurement Agent will be hired to oversee the procurement&#13;
process for the IDA-supported program. Project supervision will include procurement expertise&#13;
over the life of the project. Threshold limits reflected below have been set, considering the high-&#13;
risk environment. In addition, under the proposed Project, post-conflict grant funds will be used&#13;
to strengthen the project implementation capacity in the MOE and MOHE.&#13;
Procurement Methods&#13;
3.    The procurement arrangements and estimated costs for the project components are shown&#13;
in Table 2. Procurement under the IDA Grant would be carried out in accordance with the&#13;
"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and Credits" (January 1995, revised in January&#13;
and August 1996, September 1997, and January 1999). IDA's "Standard Request for Proposals:&#13;
Selection of Consultants" (July 1997, revised April 1998 and July 1999) would be used for&#13;
consultant services.&#13;
4.    Procurement of Goods (estimated total value US$4.0 million equivalent. including&#13;
contingencies!: The list of equipment, vehicles, furniture and supplies to be procured and their&#13;
allocation to beneficiaries will be finalized by the technical unit supporting the Project Steering&#13;
Committee in consultation with local authorities. The procurement of goods will be handled by&#13;
the Procurement Agent referred to above. The PA will be responsible for: (i) preparing technical&#13;
specifications and tender documents; (ii) carrying out tendering procedures and developing&#13;
evaluation and selection criteria; and (iii) evaluating proposals on behalf of, and in coordination&#13;
with the AACA, MOE and MOHE. The PA will be responsible for inspecting the delivery and&#13;
installation of the equipment, certifying payments in accordance with contract conditions, and&#13;
supervising the in-service training programs to be provided by the suppliers.&#13;
5.    International Shopping (IS): IS procedures will be used for contracts for goods estimated&#13;
to cost less than US$1,000,000 per contract. These procedures will be used for the procurement&#13;
of most goods under the project. This would include vehicles for the MOE and MOHE, office&#13;
equipment and furniture for MOE and MOHE central and local offices, and vocational training&#13;
equiprent and materials. It is anticipated that there will be a total of five IS packages, with an&#13;
aggregate value estimated at US$ 1.7 million.&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6.    National Shopping (NS): NS procedures will be used for contracts for goods estimated to&#13;
cost less than US$25,000 per contract. These procedures will be used for the procurement of&#13;
initial packages of office equipment and furniture needed for project start-up activities. It is&#13;
anticipated that there will be a total of three NS packages, with an aggregate value estimated at&#13;
US$32,000.&#13;
7. Direct Contracting (DC): Direct contracting will be used for the procurement of proprietary&#13;
items for reasons of compatibility and standardization, in this case, for the Distance Learning and&#13;
Government Intranet equipment and software, for purchase of updates and upgrades for software&#13;
and hardware procured under the Project, and in any other justified case, such as technical&#13;
literature, subscriptions to publications and spare parts. Any direct contracting during project&#13;
implementation will require prior IDA approval. The aggregate value of direct contracting is&#13;
estimated at US$2.3 million equivalent, including contingencies.&#13;
8.    Selection Procedures for Consulting Services and Training (estimated total value US$5.3&#13;
million equivalent, including contingencies). About 67 percent of the consultants required by the&#13;
Project shall be engaged using Quality Based Selection (QBS), and the other 33 percent shall be&#13;
engaged by other methods. Total consulting services and related training shall account for a&#13;
value of US$5.3 million, or 35 percent of project procurement. For consulting contract shortlists,&#13;
expression of interest will be obtained by advertisement in Development Business, and specific&#13;
notices will be issued in Development Business for all consulting assignments exceeding&#13;
US$200,000. In addition, advertisement will be made in the national press. Individual&#13;
consultants shall be selected in accordance with paragraphs 5.1 through 5.3 of the Guidelines:&#13;
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers.&#13;
9.    Contracts for Consulting Services have been packaged to combine related skills and&#13;
services, in order to make them attractive and increase competition as well as to reduce the&#13;
number of contracts to be managed by the project. The following procurement methods will be&#13;
followed:&#13;
10.   Quality Based  Selection  (OBS) (US$3.7  million  estimated  value, including&#13;
contingencies): QBS procedures will be used for contracting consultant services related to MOE&#13;
and MOHE policy development, skills development for public/private partnerships, women's&#13;
literacy program.&#13;
11.   Consultant Qualifications (Co) (US$0.75  million  estimated  value, including&#13;
contingencies): CQ procedures will be used primarily for contracting consulting services related&#13;
to school monitoring and supervision. There will be a total of three contracts. Services for&#13;
technical assistance may be procured under contracts awarded in accordance with the provision&#13;
of paragraphs 3.1 and 3.7 of the Consultant Guidelines, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.6&#13;
million, including contingencies.&#13;
12.   Single Source (SS) (US$0.7. million estimated value, including contingencies): Single-&#13;
source selection of consultants may be used for (i) the specialized Distance Learning technical&#13;
specialist support; and (ii) the Early Childhood Development Program, to be supported by&#13;
UNICEF which is already active in this area in Afghanistan. Aggregate value for SS is US$1.1&#13;
million, including contingencies.&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13.   Other (US$5.15 million estimated value, including contingencies). Block grants,&#13;
capitation fees and stipends are incentive schemes are being introduced under the project to&#13;
improve the education system and to increase girls' enrollment. These incentive schemes are not&#13;
strictly speaking procurements. However, any goods, small works and services purchased from&#13;
these sources will be done using prudent shopping procedures acceptable to IDA. The block&#13;
grants to the priority University of Kabul faculties (estimated value US$1.25 million) will be&#13;
disbursed based on an approval mechanism acceptable to IDA (see para. 34).&#13;

costs related to (i) managing the project; and (ii) re-lending project funds to local government.&#13;
Prior Review Thresholds&#13;
14.   In compliance with IDA procedures, standard bidding documents will be used for all&#13;
procurement financed by IDA. With respect to prior review, the procedures set forth in&#13;
paragraphs 2 and 3 of Appendix 1 of the Guidelines shall apply. It is estimated that prior review&#13;
will cover about 75 percent of the value of all contracts combined for equipment and technical&#13;
assistance financed by IDA. The remaining 25 percent of contracts will be subject to selective&#13;
post award reviews. Progress of procurement activities will be monitored by the technical team&#13;
supporting the Project Steering Committee, in cooperation with the Procurement Agent, AACA.&#13;
Periodic reports on procurement progress, including variations in schedule, will be reported to&#13;
IDA on a regular basis, as part of the Project quarterly reports.&#13;
(a)    Goods: Prior review   of bidding   documents, including   review  of evaluation,&#13;
recommendation of award and contracts will be conducted for: (i) each contract estimated&#13;
to cost the equivalent of US$250,000 or more; and (ii) the first three contracts for goods,&#13;
irrespective of the contracts' value.&#13;
21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(b)    Consulting Services: Prior review of short lists, RFPs, evaluation, recommendation of&#13;
award and contracts will be conducted for: (i) all contracts for consulting firms estimated&#13;
to cost the equivalent of US$200,000 or more; (ii) all contracts for individual consultants&#13;
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$50,000 or more; and (iii) and all sole source&#13;
contracts.&#13;
15.    The technical team of the Project Steering Committee will keep a complete and up-to-&#13;
date record of all procurement documentation and relevant correspondence in its files. All other&#13;
procurement documents and procedures will be subject to IDA's ex-post review during&#13;
supervision missions. In such cases, the Steering Committee's technical team will provide for&#13;
review of all the relevant documentation (invitation to bid/request for proposals, conditions of&#13;
contract, etc.).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX II&#13;
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, DISBURSEMENT AND AUDIT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
Country Issues&#13;
1.    Since there is no Country Profile of Financial Accountability (CPFA) or Country&#13;
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Afghanistan, there is inadequate knowledge of&#13;
country issues and related strengths and weaknesses. Financial management capacity in the&#13;
country is not fully functional and appropriate mitigation measures include the engagement of&#13;
the Financial Management Agent.&#13;
Strengths&#13;
2.    The engagement of the Financial Management Agent along with the AIA's commitment&#13;
to transparent and accountable financial management, are the primary strengths of the project's&#13;
financial management system.&#13;
Project Staffing&#13;
3.    The Financial Management Agent will support the MOF, the MOE, MEHE, and&#13;
University of Kabul to perform the necessary financial management functions. One of the critical&#13;
functions of the Financial Management Agent will be to provide hands-on support to&#13;
implementing agency staff to enhance their financial management capacity.&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
4.    The Project will follow standard AIA financial management policies and procedures,&#13;
including using the AIA Chart of Accounts to record Project expenditures. The use of these&#13;
procedures will allow for adequate recording and reporting of Project expenditures&#13;
5.    Project accounts will be consolidated centrally in the MOF, with the support of the&#13;
Financial Management Agent, for all implementing entities and consolidated Project financial&#13;
statements will be prepared for all sources and uses of Project funds.&#13;
Project Sub-Grants&#13;
6.    Sub-grants to tertiary institutes, including University of Kabul, will be given according to&#13;
the agreed operating guidelines. The Core Development Teams (CDT) in the line ministries and&#13;
the management committees in the tertiary institutes will be responsible for reviewing the&#13;
proposal for which the grant funds will be used.&#13;
Audit Arrangements&#13;
7.    The accounts of the Project will be audited by the Auditor General, with the support of&#13;
the Audit Agent, with terms of reference satisfactory to the Association. The annual Project&#13;
financial statements to the Association would include a summary of funds received (showing&#13;
funds received from all sources), and a summary of expenditures shown under the main Project&#13;
29&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
components/ activities and by main categories of expenditures. The format of the annual Project&#13;
financial statements will be similar to the Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs). The audit of the&#13;
Project accounts would also include an assessment of: (a) the adequacy of the accounting and&#13;
internal control systems; (b) the ability to maintain adequate documentation for transactions; and&#13;
(c) the eligibility of incurred expenditures for Association financing. The annual Project financial&#13;
statements audited by the Auditor General, supported by the Audit Agent, would be submitted&#13;
within 6 months of the close of AIA's fiscal year. The following audit reports will be monitored&#13;
in the Audit Reports Compliance System (ARCS):&#13;
Responsible Agenc                Audit                      Auditors&#13;

8.    Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports will be produced showing: (i) sources and uses&#13;
of funds by disbursement category and project component; (ii) physical progress; and (iii) status&#13;
of procurement activities. These will be submitted to the Association within 45 days of the end&#13;
of the quarter.&#13;

TOTAL                                    15000&#13;
9.    Financing Percentage. Since collection of tax revenue has just begun and is sporadic,&#13;
disbursement percentages have been set at 100% with the understanding, however, that MOF&#13;
will submit withdrawal applications on a net-of-tax basis. The tax structure of the AIA will be&#13;
reviewed within six months of Grant signing at which time standard disbursement percentages&#13;
will be set and financing percentages amended accordingly.&#13;
10.   Retroactive Financing. Provision has been made to reimburse AIA for payments it makes,&#13;
up to SDR 2.4 million, between April 1, 2002 and Grant signing for Project expenditures.&#13;
30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11.   Reimbursement to IDA. IDA will reimburse itself from the Grant account upon Grant&#13;
effectiveness for payments it has made in respect of Distance Learning and Communications&#13;
expenditures (Category 7) up to the SDR equivalent of US$ 2.3 million.&#13;
12.   Disbursement Method. Disbursements from the IDA Grant would be transaction-based&#13;
(replenishment, reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under Special Commitments) with&#13;
full documentation or against statements of expenditures as appropriate).&#13;
13.   Use of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Disbursements will be made on the basis of&#13;
SOEs for: (a) consultants and training for contracts not exceeding US$100,000 for firms and&#13;
US$50,000 for individuals; and (b) goods for contracts not exceeding US$250,000; (c) sub-&#13;
grants, (d) capitation grants, and (e) incremental operating costs.&#13;
14.   Special Account (SA). A Special Account will be opened and maintained in a bank&#13;
acceptable to the Association; and will be operated by MOF in accordance with the Association's&#13;
operational policies. The authorized allocation of the SA will be US$1.5 million which&#13;
represents the estimated amount of expenditures to course through the Special Account in a&#13;
three-month period. Given the short disbursement period and the immediate need for special&#13;
account funds, the full amount of the authorized allocation of the SA will be available to MOF&#13;
upon effectiveness.&#13;
15.   Minimum Application Size. Applications for replenishment to the SA will be submitted&#13;
monthly, regardless of amount, or when the SA balance is reduced by 40%, whichever comes&#13;
first. The minimum application size for withdrawal applications for reimbursement, direct&#13;
payment, or for applications for Special Commitments is 20% of the authorized allocation of the&#13;
SA. In the event that banking facilities are not fully functional at Grant effectiveness, IDA may,&#13;
on an exceptional basis, waive minimum application size requirements in order to accommodate&#13;
urgent needs.&#13;
16.   Authority to Withdraw Grant Funds. MOF will retain the right to sign and submit&#13;
withdrawal applications to the Association.&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
17.   From a financial management perspective, the Project will need intensive supervision.&#13;
The focus during the supervision will be on the internal control arrangements for the Project and&#13;
functioning of accounting, financial reporting and auditing.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
APPENDIX V&#13;
DETAILED PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN BY COMPONENT&#13;
1.   In order to carry out this project, it will be essential that the MOE and MOHE identify a&#13;
critical number of qualified civil servants who would be prepared to take on additional&#13;
responsibilities, decision-making authority and be held accountable for meeting key performance&#13;
targets which will need to be established within the education ministries. For the MOE and&#13;
MOHE, it is recommended that this core group not exceed 20 persons in total per ministry. This&#13;
would constitute a 'core development team' (CDT).&#13;
2.    It is anticipated that this core group of civil servants will require additional support in a&#13;
number of key areas, such as policy development, planning, financial management, monitoring&#13;
and evaluation, and various technical functions within the education sector.&#13;
Component 1: Promoting Skills Development and Learning&#13;
3.    Sub-Component 1.1: Literacy for Youth and ECD: Target Group: Approximately 15,000&#13;
youth aged 13-24, with a particular focus on girls and young women who have not benefited&#13;
from education opportunities in the past and require basic literacy. It also targets young children,&#13;
up to age 5, particularly the children of young women attending literacy classes (estimate 5,000).&#13;
Particular attention will be focused on out-of-school youth in urban areas, including Kabul, and&#13;
in selected provinces with low school access. Approximately 5,000 children of literacy learners,&#13;
aged 4-6, will participate in structured ECD programs. Approximately 3,000 children aged 0-6&#13;
who will benefit from home-based ECD activities provided by mothers in literacy classes.&#13;
4.    Implementation Agency: MOE through contracting of specialized NGOs.&#13;
5.    Implementation Modalities: MOE will identify NGOs active in the delivery of literacy&#13;
and ECD programs and request proposals for scaling-up to increase existing coverage.&#13;
Specialized agencies (e.g., UNICEF) with existing country programs may provide technical&#13;
assistance to the MOE for the preparation of a formal request for proposals, terms of reference&#13;
and establishing selection criteria. An NGO will be selected by the MOE on a competitive basis&#13;
under the technical supervision of the procurement support unit attached to the AACA. The&#13;
contract will be performance based and will hold the NGO accountable for defined deliverables,&#13;
such as number of youth trained and verification of the effectiveness training through&#13;
evaluations. The NGO will be responsible, as per the terms and conditions of the contract, for&#13;
providing and training instructors, and providing adequate learning spaces and teaching-learning&#13;
materials for both literacy and ECD programs. This will include the development of new ECD-&#13;
themed literacy materials to support home-based ECD activities for young mothers and children.&#13;
Teaching-leaming materials and the selection and training of instructors will be subject to the&#13;
approval of the MOE. The development of teaching-learning materials should include new&#13;
materials on home-based ECD themes. Technical assistance for this may be provided by&#13;
specialized agencies with existing support arrangements with the MOE. Similar ECD-themed&#13;
materials for use in literacy classes from other countries can be reviewed and, if acceptable to the&#13;
MOE, adapted for the Afghanistan context. IDA will review terms of reference for this contract,&#13;
as per procurement guidelines for contacts exceeding minimal thresholds. Geographic coverage&#13;
will be decided by the MOE, taking into account the location of existing programs to be scaled-&#13;
49&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
up. In areas of need where new programs may be established, lead NGOs will provide technical&#13;
assistance to smaller national NGOs.&#13;
6.    Timeline: NGO selection for scaling-up of activities should be completed within 60 days&#13;
of project effectiveness. Prior to effectiveness, specialized agencies supporting the MOE may&#13;
provide technical guidance to the MOE in the initial preparations for selecting NGOs&#13;
(identifying existing providers, establishing selection criteria, developing terms of reference,&#13;
etc.). The development of new ECD-themed literacy materials will take place during year 1 of&#13;
the project, with the production and distribution of materials to be undertaken in year 2.&#13;
7.    Costing: The affordability of the implementation methods proposed for this component&#13;
will be reviewed by MOE prior to contract award. Careful consideration will need to be given to&#13;
both the selection criteria and the long term sustainability of the program. For the purpose of this&#13;
Annex, the unit cost was derived from similar programs being carried out in the Region.&#13;
Literacy: Estimated $US6/month for a 6-month learning program x 15,000 learners =&#13;
US$2,036,000&#13;
* ECD: Estimated $US5/child/month for 24 months x 5,000 children = $US530,000&#13;
* Literacy learner stipends: US$5/month for 6 months x 15,000 learners = US$450,000&#13;
8.    Sub-Component 1.2: Increasing the Number of Girls in School: Target Group: Capitation&#13;
scheme: universities and institutes for tertiary education in Afghanistan, with the exception of the&#13;
University of Kabul, the Polytechnic Institute, the Institute of Pedagogy and the Institute of&#13;
Medicine. Stipend scheme: Approximately 15,000 school-aged children at the primary and&#13;
secondary levels of 3,500 women participating in basic skills development or literacy programs.&#13;
9.    Implementation Agencies: Ministry of Education, Ministry of Higher Education.&#13;
10.   Implementation Modalities: Capitation Scheme for Girls at the Tertiary Level: Capitation&#13;
payments (US$ 750,000) would be made immediately to universities and institutes in relation to&#13;
the number of feinale students enrolled in the first year of the academic programs. The following&#13;
academic year, an additional tranche of capitation payments (US$750,000) would be made to&#13;
universities and institutions in proportion to the net increase in intake of female students over&#13;
the previous year.&#13;
11.   Each institution would elaborate a development plan indicating the current status of the&#13;
institution and the actions to be undertaken to upgrade the quality and relevance of the academic&#13;
programs in the short term. The development plan would stipulate how the capitation fee would&#13;
be used to address the most emergent needs, and include a time line for implementation&#13;
indicating milestones and required funding for each period. Each development plan would be&#13;
elaborated by the Deans, the academic staff and students under leadership of the Head of the&#13;
institution. A completed development plan would be signed by the Head of the institution, three&#13;
Deans, three members of the academic staff and five students. The Head of the institution would&#13;
submit the endorsed proposal to the Ministry of Higher Education. The Heads of the institutions&#13;
and Deans would organize the internal monitoring of the implementation of the activities to be&#13;
financed by the capitation fee.&#13;
12.   A development plan of an institution would contain information on the number of&#13;
students (gender, age, regional origin), the number of staff (gender, age, academic qualification,&#13;
50&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
remuneration scales, hours teaching load per week for a full time employment), available&#13;
infrastructure, equipment, budget, additional sources of income including support received or&#13;
pending from international development partners, and actions to enhance institutional capacity&#13;
and the quality of future graduates. The plan should also indicate the priority investments to be&#13;
financed under the grant and indicate the relationship to the development goals, the future&#13;
actions and investment needs.&#13;
13.   The MOHE would appoint an External Review Committee composed of two Senior&#13;
officials, one of the MOHE and one of the MOF, and one academic with international experience&#13;
in higher education to be hired from a well established NGO in Afghanistan. This review&#13;
committee will make site visits at random to institutions and faculties to validate the&#13;
development plans and the implementation of the rehabilitation and quality upgrading efforts.&#13;
The review committee will provide bi-annual reports to the MOHE. The cost for monitoring and&#13;
supervision is estimated to be US$10,000 and will be disbursed based on actual expenses and&#13;
financed by the project through the Ministry of Higher Education.&#13;
14.   Capitation Scheme for Girls at the Secondary Level: A capitation payment of&#13;
$US100/girl up to a total payment of US$1.0 million for all girls' secondary schools will be&#13;
disbursed at effectiveness. For the following academic year, the capitation fee of $US100/girl&#13;
will be paid in proportion to the net increase in intake of female students over the previous year,&#13;
up to a maximum of US$1.0 million.&#13;
15.   Each secondary school will prepare and present a proposal to the MOE for use of funds&#13;
accrued under this scheme. The proposal will stipulate how the capitation fee would be used to&#13;
address the most urgent needs for school improvement. Once approved by the MOE, the school&#13;
will be authorized to purchase those items under the supervision of the procurement agent of the&#13;
AACA.&#13;
16.   Stipend Scheme: The NGO implementing the basic skills training activity will implement&#13;
the stipend scheme using the same processes and criteria applicable for the skill training contract&#13;
with the MOE. The NGO's terms of reference will include verification that the learner attended&#13;
training for the first and second semester, and that payment of the stipend (2X/year) would be&#13;
based on this verification. This will be carried out in collaboration with local MOE authorities.&#13;
Arrangements for the payment of stipends will be determined in consultation with the NGO&#13;
based on known good practice. Stipends will be available for children of trainees in basic skills&#13;
training program on a pilot basis.&#13;
17.   Timeline: The Universities and Institutes will be invited to submit the proposals for&#13;
evaluation to the Ministry of Higher education by July 1, 2002. The External Review Committee&#13;
will have made the site visits by July, 15, 2002, and given their recommendation to the MOHE&#13;
by August 1, 2002. By August 15, 2002, the implementation of the activities financed by the first&#13;
tranche of the capitation payments will be started with completion expected by September 1,&#13;
2003. By June 2003, the rehabilitation and quality upgrading activities funded by the second&#13;
tranche of the capitation fee will start with completion expected by June, 2004. Procurement of&#13;
goods and services done by the respective universities and institutions will be under the&#13;
supervision of the procurement agent attached to the AACA. The girls secondary school&#13;
capitation scheme will be initiated immediately following effectiveness. Prior to effectiveness,&#13;
data on the number of girls secondary schools and girls enrolled should be gathered.&#13;
51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Disbursements will follow once the approved list of required goods and materials is received and&#13;
validated by the MOE.&#13;
18.   Costing:&#13;
* Stipends for primary and secondary school children of literacy learners and basic&#13;
skills trainees: 15,000 children x US$20 x 1 year = $US270,000&#13;
* The capitation scheme at the tertiary level would be up to a maximum of US$250 per&#13;
student up to a maximum of US$750,000 per year. It is estimated that universities and&#13;
institutions, on average will receive US$75,000 per academic year.&#13;
* The capitation scheme at the secondary level would be up to a maximum of US$ 100&#13;
per girI up to a maximum of US$1.0 million per year.&#13;
19.   Sub-Component 1.3: Skills Development for Underserved Groups: Target Group:&#13;
Approximately 3,500 learners for basic skills and 1,200 learners for advanced skills in urban&#13;
areas, particularly war widows and ex-combatants.&#13;
20.   Implementation Agencies: Ministry of Education through contracted NGOs.&#13;
21.   Implementation Modalities: Skills Development Scheme: MOE will identify NGOs&#13;
active in the delivery of basic skills programs and request proposals for scaling-up existing&#13;
coverage. The advanced skills program will be initiated following a market analysis to establish&#13;
the demand-driven training requirements for the target group. Specialized agencies with existing&#13;
country programs may provide technical assistance to the MOE for the preparation of a formal&#13;
request for proposals, terms of reference and establishing selection criteria. An NGO will be&#13;
selected by the MOE on a competitive basis under the technical supervision of the procurement&#13;
support unit attached to the AACA. The contract will be performance based and will hold the&#13;
NGO accountable for defined deliverables, such as number of people trained and verification of&#13;
the effectiveness of training through evaluations. The NGO will be responsible, as per the terms&#13;
and conditions of the contract, for providing and training instructors, and providing adequate&#13;
learning spaces and materials. Training materials and the selection and training of instructors will&#13;
be subject to the approval of the MOE. IDA will review terms of reference for this contract, as&#13;
per procurement guidelines for contacts exceeding minimal thresholds. Geographic coverage will&#13;
be decided by the MOE, taking into account the location of existing programs to be scaled-up.&#13;
Particular focus will be placed on urban centers. In areas of need where new programs may be&#13;
established, lead NGOs will provide technical assistance to smaller national NGOs.&#13;
22.   Stipend Scheme: The NGO implementing the basic skills training activity will implement&#13;
the stipend scheme using the same processes and criteria applicable for the skill training contract&#13;
with the MOE. The NGO's terms of reference will include verification that the leamer attended&#13;
training, and payment of the stipend would be based on this verification. Arrangements for the&#13;
payment of stipends will be determined in consultation with the NGO based on known good&#13;
practice. Stipends will be available for trainees in basic skills training program on a pilot basis.&#13;
23.   Timeline: Skills Training and Stipend Scheme: The advanced skills program will be&#13;
initiated following a market analysis to be completed within approximately 6 months following&#13;
effectiveness. NGO selection for scaling-up the basic skills training should be completed within&#13;
60 days of project effectiveness. Prior to effectiveness, specialized agencies supporting the MOE&#13;
may provide technical guidance to the MOE in the initial preparations for selecting NGOs&#13;
52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(identifying existing providers, establishing selection criteria, developing terms of reference,&#13;
etc.).&#13;
24.   Costing:&#13;
* Basic skills development: US$10/month x 2 months training for 3,500 learners forl&#13;
year = US$400,000&#13;
* Advanced skills development: US$30/month x 3 months training for 1,200 learners&#13;
for 1 year = US$500,000&#13;
*  Basic skills trainees stipends: 3,500 trainees x US$10 x 2 months = US$70,000&#13;
*  Market Analysis: US$15,000&#13;
25.   Stipends: A standard stipend payment scheme will be implemented for learners in the&#13;
literacy and basic skills training programs and for their children attending primary and secondary&#13;
schools. Stipends for 15,000 youth literacy learners will be US$5/month for a 6-month program.&#13;
Stipends for 3,500 trainees in the basic skills development program will be US$10/month for a&#13;
two-month program. Stipends for primary and secondary school children of learners/trainees will&#13;
be US$20/year, paid in two installments. The estimated number of children will be 13,500. The&#13;
NGOs contracted to provide literacy and skills training will be responsible for payment of&#13;
stipends for both learners/trainees and their children, and for verification and monitoring of the&#13;
stipend system. This will include verifying satisfactory participation in training programs and&#13;
school attendance against established criteria. Exact criteria for verification and monitoring will&#13;
be detailed in the TOR, and examples of good international practice will be reviewed for this&#13;
purpose.&#13;
Component 2: Education Sector Management Reform&#13;
26.   Sub-Component 2.1: Policy Development Through Stakeholder Dialogue: For&#13;
development of the policy framework and sector analyses, the project will provide technical&#13;
assistance for the establishment of a Steering Committee within the main education ministries&#13;
comprising staff from the CDT, key departments and representation of major stakeholders from&#13;
civil society, including women's and parents' associations. Additional specialized technical&#13;
assistance will be provided for selected units within the ministries, such as the Primary,&#13;
Secondary, NFE, Technical/Vocational, Planning, Assessment/Accreditation, Curriculum and&#13;
Teacher Training departments. The project will provide technical, financial and material support&#13;
for a number of workshops and civil society consultations on policy to be held at the regional,&#13;
provincial and community levels. The technical assistance contract will be in place by September&#13;
2002. In addition, the MOE will support the Government's work in carrying out a proposed&#13;
Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS) which will provide the Government and other&#13;
stakeholders with critical data and analysis to formulate policy in Afghanistan.&#13;
27.   Sub-Component 2.2: Skills Development for Quality Schools and Institutions: For further&#13;
developing skills of the CDT, technical assistance will be procured to design an on-the-job&#13;
training program while supporting the day-to-day work of the CDT at the central and provincial&#13;
levels. Funds will also be available to procure short-term training through the DLC.&#13;
28.   A small number of vehicles will be procured to provide mobility in provincial ministry&#13;
offices, particularly to address the transport requirements of personnel in areas that are remote or&#13;
difficult to reach. Computers, related IT support and basic office equipment and supplies at the&#13;
53&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
central and provincial levels will be funded from this sub-component through the procurement&#13;
arrangements described in Appendix I.&#13;
29.   For developing decentralized management structures, particularly at the community level,&#13;
the project will support the establishment of Village Education Committees (VECs) under the&#13;
umbrella of the proposed Community Driven Development (CDD) Project. A pilot scheme will&#13;
be carried out during the first 12 months of the project targeting 100 villages. Following a&#13;
successful pilot phase, this will be scaled-up to 500 villages during year 2 of project&#13;
implementation. This will be designed and implemented through a performance-based contract&#13;
with a qualified NGO with extensive experience in community participation in education. The&#13;
process for NGO identification and selection will be the same as in Component 1 above.&#13;
30.   For improved district-level monitoring of schools for supporting quality teaching-&#13;
learning, a lead NGO with a successful track record of providing quality inputs will be&#13;
contracted. The procurement of basic office equipment and supplies for district level ministry&#13;
offices will be funded from this sub-component through the procurement arrangements described&#13;
in Appendix I, with priority given to those districts which are being supported by an NGO for&#13;
improved monitoring of schools.&#13;
31.    Under a separate source of funding, i.e. the World Bank President's Funds, funds will be&#13;
available to establish, at the University of Kabul, Department of Management, a chair to develop&#13;
and mainstream a critical mass of women managers and establish an endowment for scholarships&#13;
for young women.&#13;
32.   Block Grants for Tertiary education (US$1,250,000): Target: University of Kabul, the&#13;
Polytechnic Institute Kabul, the Institute of Pedagogy of Kabul and the Institute of Medical&#13;
Sciences of Kabul. Five grants for a maximurn amount of US$100,000 each will be awarded to&#13;
the faculties of Education, Law and Political Science (the Department of Management),&#13;
Engineering, Agriculture and Economics of the University of Kabul. In addition, two block&#13;
grants of US$100,000 each will be awarded for the rehabilitation of hostel facilities for girls and&#13;
boys of the University of Kabul. One block grant of US$250,000 will be granted to University of&#13;
Kabul and three block grants of US$100,000 each will be awarded to the Polytechnic Institute,&#13;

for the rehabilitation of hostel facilities for female and male students of the University of Kabul&#13;
and US$10,000 for monitoring and evaluation activities. The funding level of US$100,000 is&#13;
based on the priorities and high impact requirements to address urgent needs.&#13;
Component 3: Distance Learning and Communications&#13;
42.   The AACA is responsible for implementation of this component. The component will&#13;
provide a basic set of telecommunications, office and networking technology, Internet&#13;
Connectivity and supporting applications, including The Afghanistan Reconstruction Gateway&#13;
(ARG), for a priority set of Afghanistan Interim Authority Ministries. The GDLN DLC and&#13;
Government intranet will form an integrated program, and will be temporarily located in the&#13;
headquarters of the newly established AACA. The site meets GDLN minimum standards, and&#13;
UNDP has agreed to finance and implement site renovation, including furniture. Renovation&#13;
work has begun, and is expected to be completed by early April 2002. Because the AACA&#13;
currently does not have the capacity to deliver the GDLN and Government Intranet components,&#13;
IDA has been asked to assist in delivering and building local capacity to sustain these&#13;
investments.&#13;
43.   The DLC/integrated internet will be limited to the Chairman's Office, the AACA, the&#13;
Central Bank, and three Ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Reconstruction and Higher&#13;
Education in the initial phase.&#13;
44.   The project will finance operating costs of the DLC for two years, including connectivity,&#13;
local staff and staff training. Contents for the distance learning program will be developed in line&#13;
with the needs assessments and the proposed TA component of the IDA grant program. The&#13;
AACA has issued a note to the donor community explaining the component and its relationship&#13;
to ongoing work by the UN agencies to establish communication between those agencies and the&#13;
AIA.&#13;
45.   Equipment needs will include the provision of local infrastructure equipment, local and&#13;
global connectivity equipment, pedagogical tools, and logistical support. Provision will be made&#13;
for training in telecommunications and distance learning for DLC staff. Programming&#13;
requirements for the DLC, including programmers, software, translation, and specialized&#13;
equipment and materials will be covered, along with operational costs, including satellite&#13;
capacity, local staff salaries, technical training and operating materials and supplies.&#13;
46.   The priority ministries and agencies benefiting from a government internet will include&#13;
initially: AACA, Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and&#13;
Reconstruction, Ministry of Higher Education, Ministry of Education, and the University of&#13;
Kabul. Financing will cover technical assistance, training, computer and telecommunications&#13;
equipment and software applications, and operating costs and supplies.&#13;

APPENDIX VI&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS FRAMEWORK&#13;
Objectives&#13;
1.    The Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework provides general policies,&#13;
guidelines, codes of practice and procedures to be integrated into the implementation of IDA-&#13;
supported emergency reconstruction operations in Afghanistan. Consistent with existing national&#13;
legislation, the objective of the Framework is to help ensure that activities under the proposed&#13;
reconstruction operations will:&#13;
*     Protect human health;&#13;
*     Prevent or compensate any loss of livelihood;&#13;
*     Prevent environmental degradation as a result of either individual sub-projects or their&#13;
cumulative effects;&#13;
*     Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes; and,&#13;
*     Ensure compliance with IDA safeguard policies.&#13;
General Principles&#13;
2.    Recognizing the emergency nature of the proposed relief and reconstruction operations,&#13;
and the related need for providing immediate assistance, while at the same time ensuring due&#13;
diligence in managing potential environmental and social risks, this Framework is based on the&#13;
following principles:&#13;
The proposed operations will support multiple sub-projects, the detailed designs of which&#13;
may not be known at appraisal. To ensure the effective application of IDA's safeguard&#13;
policies, the Framework provides guidance on the approach to be taken during&#13;
implementation for the selection and design of sub-projects, and the planning of&#13;
mitigation measures;&#13;
*  The proposed emergency reconstruction operations will not support environmental&#13;
Category A sub-projects, nor sub-projects requiring land acquisition affecting 200 or&#13;
more people. Consequently, no Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) or&#13;
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) will be required. With the exception of support for&#13;
the emergency rehabilitation of the Kabul North-West power plant, no sub-projects&#13;
requiring separate, site-specific environmental or social reports will be supported. With&#13;
this exception, all proposed sub-projects will be screened to ensure that the&#13;
environmental and social risks can be adequately addressed through the application of&#13;
standardized guidelines and codes of practice;&#13;
* Activities requiring a more detailed level of assessment, such as those entailing the&#13;
construction or installation of new or significantly expanded infrastructure, will be&#13;
supported under subsequent operations. The proposed emergency reconstruction&#13;
operations will finance feasibility and detailed design studies for these subsequent&#13;
investments, which will include environmental and social impact assessments as required&#13;
by IDA safeguard policies;&#13;
6As defined in World Bank Operational Policy 4.01, Environmental Assessment.&#13;
59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Project design and sub-project selection will aim to maintain regional balance, and equity&#13;
between genders, and ethnic and religious groups, considering variations in population&#13;
density. Employment opportunities within the projects will be available on an equal basis&#13;
to all, on the basis of professional competence, irrespective of gender, or ethnic or&#13;
religious group. In all projects which require consultations with local communities or&#13;
beneficiaries, gender-separated consultations will be conducted to elicit the views of the&#13;
female population, along with that of the male population; and,&#13;
Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplified to meet the special needs of&#13;
these operations. Prior to approval by World Bank Board, this Environmental and Social&#13;
Safeguards Framework will be disclosed in Afghanistan in Dari and Pashto, and in the&#13;
World Bank Infoshop.&#13;
Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
3.    The selection, design, contracting, monitoring and evaluation of sub-projects will be&#13;
consistent with the following guidelines, codes of practice and requirements:&#13;
*  A negative list of characteristics that would make a proposed sub-project ineligible for&#13;
support, as indicated in Attachment 1;&#13;
*  Guidelines for land and asset acquisition, entitlements and compensation, presented in&#13;
Attachment 2;&#13;
*  Procedures for the protection of cultural property, including the chance discovery of&#13;
archaeological artifacts, and unrecorded graveyards and burial sites, provided in&#13;
Attachment 3;&#13;
*  Relevant elements of the codes of practice for the mitigation of potential environmental&#13;
impacts, presented in Attachment 4; and,&#13;
&#149;  The requirement that confirmation is received through the Regional Mine Action Center&#13;
that areas to be accessed during reconstruction and rehabilitation activities have been&#13;
demined.&#13;
4.    In addition to these requirements, an environmental audit will be conducted as part of&#13;
feasibility study and detailed design for the rehabilitation of the Kabul North-West power plant.&#13;
Responsibilities for Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
5.    A number of Ministries will act as the implementing agencies for the proposed&#13;
operations, including the Ministries of Reconstruction and Rural Development, Public Works,&#13;
Power, and Housing, Planning and Building. Each Ministry will be responsible for applying the&#13;
safeguard screening and mitigation requirements to its own sub-projects.&#13;
6.    Within each Ministry, a Safeguards Focal Point will be identified with responsibility for&#13;
overseeing the implementation of the Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework.&#13;
60&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Capacity Building and Monitoring of Safeguard Framework Implementation&#13;
7.    As part of the capacity building that will be provided for implementation of the proposed&#13;
operations, the Safeguards Focal Points and relevant staff of the concerned Ministries will also&#13;
receive training in the application of the Safeguard Framework.&#13;
8.    To assist in this capacity building, and to provide subsequent guidance and review of the&#13;
application of the Framework, GoA will contract specialist social and environmental services.&#13;
During supervision of these operations, IDA will assess the implementation of the Framework,&#13;
and if required will recommend additional strengthening.&#13;
Consultation and Disclosure&#13;
9.    This Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework was prepared in consultation with&#13;
the principal NGOs and development partners participating in reconstruction activities in&#13;
Afghanistan. It will be disclosed by GoA in both Dari and Pashto, as well as English, and it will&#13;
also be made available at the World Bank's Infoshop.&#13;
10.   The environmental audit to be prepared for the rehabilitation of the Kabul North-West&#13;
thermal power station will be made publicly available by GoA, and at the World Bank Infoshop.&#13;
Since no other separate environmental or social assessments will be prepared for activities under&#13;
the proposed reconstruction operations, no additional disclosure requirements will apply. In this&#13;
regard, however, it is worth noting that GoA intends to make all project documentation publicly&#13;
available through the Afghan Information Management System (AIMS).&#13;
11.   The proposed operations will support a number of feasibility and detailed design studies&#13;
for future infrastructure investments, for which IDA safeguard policies relating to consultation&#13;
and disclosure will apply. In particular, for environmental Category A and B investments7&#13;
proposed for future operations, the implementing agency will consult project-affected groups and&#13;
local nongovernmental organizations about the project's environmental and social aspects, and&#13;
will take their views into account. The implementing agency will initiate such consultations as&#13;
early as possible, and for meaningful consultations, will provide relevant material in a timely&#13;
manner prior to consultation, in a form and language that are understandable and accessible to&#13;
the groups being consulted.&#13;
12.   For Category A projects, the implementing agency will consult these groups at least&#13;
twice, (i) shortly after environmental screening and before the terms of reference for the&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) are finalized, and (ii) once a draft EIA report is&#13;
prepared. For the initial consultation, the implementing agency will provide a summary of the&#13;
proposed project's objectives, description, and potential impacts. For both Category A and B&#13;
projects, the implementing agency will provide these groups with a summary of the EIA report's&#13;
conclusions. In addition, the implementing agency will make the draft reports available at a&#13;
public place accessible to project-affected groups and local NGOs.&#13;

APPENDIX VI&#13;
Attachment 2&#13;
Guidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition, Entitlements and Compensation&#13;
Objectives&#13;
1.    Land acquisition will be kept to a minimum and no person will be involuntarily displaced&#13;
under sub-projects financed by the proposed emergency reconstruction operations. Sub-project&#13;
proposals that would require demolishing houses or acquiring productive land should be&#13;
carefully reviewed to minimize or avoid their impacts through alternative alignments. Proposals&#13;
that require more than minor expansion along rights of way should be reviewed carefully. No&#13;
land or asset acquisition may take place outside of these guidelines. A format for Land&#13;
Acquisition Assessment is attached as Annex 1.&#13;
2.    These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate affected persons to&#13;
ensure that all such persons negatively affected, regardless of their land tenure status, will be&#13;
assisted to improve, or at least to restore, their living standards, income earning or production&#13;
capacity to pre-project levels.&#13;
Categorization&#13;
3.    Based on the number of persons that may be affected by the project (Project Affected&#13;
People, PAPs) and the magnitude of impacts, projects may be categorized as S-1, S-2, or S-3&#13;
projects:&#13;
a.    S-I projects are those that will involve the resettlement of more than 200 PAPs and&#13;
where a full Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) must be produced. Such interventions&#13;
will be ineligible for support under the proposed emergency reconstruction&#13;
operations.&#13;
b.    S-2 projects are those which will involve the resettlement of less than 200 persons. In&#13;
such cases, the following documentation is required: (1) a land acquisition&#13;
assessment, (2) the Minutes or record of consultations which assess the compensation&#13;
claimed and agreement reached, and (3) a record of the receipt of the compensation,&#13;
or voluntary donation, by those affected (see below).&#13;
c.    S-3 projects are not expected to have any land acquisition or any other significant&#13;
adverse social impacts; on the contrary, significant positive social impact and&#13;
improved livelihoods are expected from such interventions.&#13;
Eligibility&#13;
4.    PAPs are identified as persons whose livelihood is directly or indirectly affected by the&#13;
project. PAPs deemed eligible for compensation are:&#13;
a.    those who have formal legal rights to land, water resources or structures/buildings,&#13;
including recognized customary and traditional rights;&#13;
b.    those who do not have such formal legal rights but have a claim to usufruct right&#13;
rooted in customary law; and&#13;
64&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
c.    those whose claim to land and water resources or building/structures do not fall&#13;
within (1) and (2) above, are eligible to assistance to restore their livelihood.&#13;
Acquisition of Productive Assets and Compensation&#13;
5.    PAPs are eligible for replacement costs for lost assets as described below:&#13;
a.    Voluntary contributions. In accordance with traditional practices, individuals may&#13;
elect to voluntarily contribute land or assets and/or relocate temporarily or&#13;
permanently from their land without compensation.&#13;
b.    Contributions against compensation. A contributor/asset loser considered "affected"&#13;
will be eligible for compensation from the local community or alternatively from the&#13;
Government. A PAP shall lodge his/her claim for compensation to the local&#13;
community representatives/shura head and it shall be verified by the implementing&#13;
agency. The claim shall be lodged within 2 weeks of completion of the consultations&#13;
with the concerned community, and before project implementation begins.&#13;
6.    Voluntary contribution, or contribution against compensation, should be documented.&#13;
The documentation should specify that the land is free of any squatters, encroachers or other&#13;
claims. A format is attached in Annex 2, which includes a Schedule to be followed to assess any&#13;
compensation claimed and the agreement reached.&#13;
Compensation Principles&#13;
7.    The project implementing agencies shall ensure that any of the following means of&#13;
compensation are provided in a timely manner to affected persons:&#13;
Project affected persons losing access to a portion of their land or other productive assets&#13;
with the remaining assets being economically viable are entitled to compensation at&#13;
replacement cost for that portion of land or assets lost to them. Compensation for the lost&#13;
assets will be according to following principles:&#13;
a.    replacement land with an equally productive plot, cash or other equivalent&#13;
productive assets;&#13;
b.    materials and assistance to fully replace solid structures that will be demolished;&#13;
c.    replacement of damaged or lost crops and trees, at market value;&#13;
d.    other acceptable in-kind compensation;&#13;
e.    in case of cash compensation, the delivery of compensation should be made in&#13;
public, i.e. at the Community Meeting.&#13;
Project affected persons losing access to a portion of their land or other economic assets&#13;
rendering the remainder economically non-viable, will have the options of compensation&#13;
for the entire asset by provision of alternative land, cash or equivalent productive asset,&#13;
according to the principles in (1) a-d above.&#13;
65&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Consultation Process&#13;
8.    The implementing agencies will ensure that all occupants of land and owners of assets&#13;
located in a proposed sub-project area are consulted. There will be gender-separate community&#13;
meetings for each affected mantaqa/gozar (urban infrastructure) or village (other projects) to&#13;
inform the local population about their rights to compensation and options available in&#13;
accordance with these Guidelines. The Minutes of the community meetings shall reflect the&#13;
discussions held, agreements reached, and include details of the agreement, based on the format&#13;
provided in Annex 2.&#13;
9.    The implementing agency shall provide a copy of the Minutes to affected persons and&#13;
confirm in discussions with each of them their requests and preferences for compensation,&#13;
agreements reached, and any eventual complaint. Copies will be recorded in the posted project&#13;
documentation and be available for inspection during supervision.&#13;
Sub-project Approval&#13;
10.   In the event that a sub-project involves acquisition against compensation, the&#13;
implementing agency shall:&#13;
a. not approve the sub-project unless a satisfactory compensation has been agreed&#13;
between the affected person and the local community;&#13;
b. not allow works to start until the compensation has been delivered in a satisfactory&#13;
manner to the affected persons;&#13;
c. if more than 200 persons are affected and require compensation, the sub-project shall&#13;
be deemed ineligible for support under the emergency reconstruction operations.&#13;
Complaints and Grievances&#13;
11.   All complaints should first be negotiated to reach an agreement at the local&#13;
community/village level. If this falls, complaints and grievances about these Guidelines,&#13;
implementation of the agreements recorded in the Community Meeting Minutes or any alleged&#13;
irregularity in carrying out the project can also be addressed by the affected persons or their&#13;
representative at the municipal or district level. If this also fails, the complaint may be submitted&#13;
to the relevant implementing agency for a decision.&#13;
Verification&#13;
12.   The Community Meeting Minutes, including agreements of compensation and evidence&#13;
of compensation having been made shall be provided to the Municipality/district, to the&#13;
supervising engineers, who will maintain a record hereof, and to auditors and socio-economic&#13;
monitors when they undertake reviews and post-project assessment. This process shall be&#13;
specified in all relevant project documents, including details of the relevant authority for&#13;
complaints at municipal/district or implementing agency level.&#13;

Attachment 6&#13;
Protection of Cultural Property&#13;
1.    Physical culture includes monuments, structures, works of art, or sites of "outstanding&#13;
universal value" from the historical, aesthetic, scientific, ethnological, or anthropological point of&#13;
view, including unrecorded graveyards and burial sites. Within this broader definition, cultural&#13;
property is defined as sites and structures having archaeological, paleontological, historical,&#13;
architectural, or religious significance, and natural sites with cultural values.&#13;
2.    The proposed emergency reconstruction operations are unlikely to pose a risk of&#13;
damaging cultural property, as the sub-projects will largely consist of small investments in&#13;
community infrastructure and income generating activities, reconstruction of existing structures,&#13;
and minor urban public works. Further, the negative list of attributes, which would make a sub-&#13;
project ineligible for support (Attachment 1), includes any activity that would significantly&#13;
damage non-replicable cultural property.  Nevertheless, the following procedures for&#13;
identification, protection from theft, and treatment of chance finds should be followed and&#13;
included in standard bid documents.&#13;
Chance Find Procedures&#13;
3.    Chance find procedures are defined in the law on Maintenance of Historical and Cultural&#13;
Monuments (Official Gazette, December 21, 1980), specifying the authorities and&#13;
responsibilities of cultural heritage agencies if sites or materials are discovered in the course of&#13;
project implementation. This law establishes that all moveable and immovable historical and&#13;
cultural artifacts are state property, and further:&#13;
a. The responsibility for preservation, maintenance and assessment of historical and cultural&#13;
monuments rests with the Archaeological Committee under the Ministry of Information&#13;
and Culture, which has representation at provincial level.&#13;
b. Whenever chance finds of cultural or historical artifacts (moveable and immovable) are&#13;
made the Archaeological Committee should be informed. Should the continuation of&#13;
work endanger the historical and cultural artifacts, the project work should be suspended&#13;
until a solution is found for the preservation of these artifacts.&#13;
c. If a moveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact is found in the countryside of a&#13;
province, the provincial governor (wali) or district-in-charge (woluswal) should be&#13;
informed within two weeks, and they should inforrn the Archaeological Committee. In&#13;
case the immovable historical or cultural artifact is found in a city, the provincial branch&#13;
of the Department of Maintenance of Historical Values of the Ministry of Information&#13;
and Culture should be informed within two weeks (art. 18). If the find is made within the&#13;
center, the Archaeological Committee must be informed. directly within one week (art.&#13;
25).&#13;
d. Failure to report a chance find within the stipulated time limit will be punished with a&#13;
fine or imprisonment for a period of one week or up to one month (art. 72).&#13;
70&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
e. If someone intentionally damages a historical or cultural artifact, the culprit shall pay&#13;
compensation in accordance with the value of the artifact plus be imprisoned for a period&#13;
of one month to ten years depending on the gravity of the crime (art. 71).&#13;
4.    In case of a chance find of moveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact, the&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The project overall objective is to
            selectively support the Government's emergency
            education program, by specifically helping in increasing
            access to education in both the formal, and non-formal
            education systems for under-served groups, in particular
            women and girls, Moreover, the project will prod education
            management reforms at all levels, in partnership with civil
            society, nongovernmental organizations, and the private
            sector, in addition to introducing modern information
            technologies for communications, and distance learning.
            However, there are significant risk categories for this
            project, namely, the potential deterioration within the
            political and security context, the limited implementation
            capacity, the non-payment issue of teachers' salaries,
            in addition to the likely inability to disburse (or misuse)
            project funds. It is foreseen that the benefits of the
            project, and its appropriate design, should mitigate those risks.
