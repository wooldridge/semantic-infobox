1. THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
A. THE MONGOLIAN ECONOMY&#13;
Background&#13;
1.1   Compared with many other low-income countries, Mongolia's economy is&#13;
relatively well diversified. The agricultural sector, focusing primarily on livestock,&#13;
accounts for about 20 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Industry accounts for&#13;
about 45 percent of GDP, including mining, processed wool, cashmere, leather, food and&#13;
construction materials. The service sector accounts for the balance, including a large&#13;
government sector, a weak banking system, and a growing wholesale and retail trading&#13;
sector.&#13;
1.2   Although Mongolia encompasses an area between Russia and China of 1.6&#13;
million square kilometers, which is about half the size of India, the country has a&#13;
population of only 2.2 million people. Almost 60 percent of the population is urban, with&#13;
over one-quarter of the people living in the capital city, Ulaanbaatar. Per capita GDP in&#13;
1993 is estimated at only $320, but the population is well educated, with an adult literacy&#13;
rate of 96 percent.&#13;
1.3   Although independent, Mongolia was closely allied with the former Soviet Union&#13;
during 1921-90, and isolated from the rest of the world. Mongolia was built into a&#13;
centrally-planned economy with a communist political system. Until 1990, the country&#13;
received substantial aid from the Soviet Union equivalent to 30 percent of its GDP.&#13;
Soviet aid was used to build an industrial/mineral base and the country's transportation&#13;
and energy systems. Mongolia enjoyed a "captive" market for its products in Council of&#13;
Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) countries.&#13;
1.4   Mongolia suffered greatly when Soviet aid stopped in 1990 and trade with the&#13;
CMEA was disrupted. Real GDP declined by 20 percent in 1990-93 and both exports&#13;
and imports fell sharply. The shock was compounded by shortages of spare parts and&#13;
machinery from the former Soviet Union, used extensively in Mongolian industries.&#13;
Inflation accelerated to an annual rate of 100 percent in 1991, and continued to rise,&#13;
reaching 331 percent in 1993. These circumstances helped precipitate political change,&#13;
and in 1992 general elections were held under a new democratic constitution.&#13;
Economic Trends and Reforms&#13;
1.5   Mongolia has implemented a series of economic reforms since 1990 aimed at&#13;
stabilizing economic performance and restructuring the economy into a market-based&#13;
system. Positive results have been achieved during the last two years. Gross domestic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
product grew by 2.5 percent, rising to an estimated 6.3 percent in 1995. Inflation has&#13;
softened to 50 to 60 percent per year during 1994 and 1995. Shortages of goods have&#13;
subsided, and the balance of payments crisis has eased. The exchange rate has remained&#13;
relatively stable since May 1993. Compared to most Republics of the former Soviet&#13;
Union, the 1990-93 decline was less severe, and Mongolia is one of the few to have&#13;
resumed positive growth. Factors contributing to this include: (a) implementation of&#13;
tough monetary, fiscal and exchange rate measures; (b) successful privatization of&#13;
virtually all herds and small-scale enterprises; (c) timely international donor support&#13;
during the early crisis years; (d) political stability; and (e) steady Government&#13;
commitment to reforms. The Government and society at large are aware that a return to&#13;
the past is impossible and emphasize that a market-oriented economy based on&#13;
democratic principles is central to their development philosophy.&#13;
1.6   The current economic reform agenda remains broad and ambitious, including:&#13;
(a)   Continued efforts to ensure macroeconomic stability, in part through&#13;
further efforts to tighten credit expansion, reduce subsidized credit, and&#13;
implement tax reforms;&#13;
(b)   Continued efforts to reduce public expenditures and especially subsidies&#13;
for urban transport, social security, and energy;&#13;
(c)   Reform of public enterprises, expansion of the role of the private sector in&#13;
large firms, and introduction of a secondary market for company shares, in&#13;
order to increase enterprise autonomy, accountability, commercial focus&#13;
and efficiency;&#13;
(d)   Commercialization and strengthening of the banking system; and&#13;
(e)   Improvement of the operating environment for the emerging market&#13;
system through further legal and regulatory system reforms and&#13;
institutional development.&#13;
1.7   With continued implementation of the Government's stabilization and reform&#13;
program, Mongolia has good prospects for economic growth. Provided that no large&#13;
external shocks are encountered and the stable political environment is maintained, GDP&#13;
growth levels of 4 to 5 percent per year may be maintained into the next century.&#13;
B. ENERGY SUPPLY AND USE&#13;
1.8   Domestically produced coal is Mongolia's dominant fuel, accounting for&#13;
80 percent of primary commercial energy supply in 1993 (see Table 1.1). Petroleum&#13;
products imported from Russia account for about 19 percent of primary energy supply,&#13;
and imports of electricity from Russia complete the commercial energy balance.&#13;

1.9    Domestic coal production accounts for 80 percent of the country's primary energy&#13;
supply. Mongolia's cities and large towns are constructed around coal-fired combined&#13;
heat-and-power (CHP) plants, which provide electricity and district heat to urban&#13;
residents during Mongolia's very severe and long winter. Ulaanbaatar, the coldest capital&#13;
in the world, is dependent upon three such CHP plants of Russian design. The plants are&#13;
supplied by rail with lignite produced in three major open-pit mines. The CHP plants, in&#13;
turn, provide about 85 percent of the nation's electricity supply, district heat for about&#13;
one-half of the large urban population, and steam for a number of industries. Mongolia's&#13;
urban economy and population are critically dependent upon the systems.&#13;
1.10   Energy production fell sharply with the economic crisis of the early 1990s. Coal&#13;
production fell 35 percent from a peak of 8.6 million tons in 1988 to 5.5 million tons in&#13;
1993 and 1994. Electricity sales in the main system fell from 2,800 GWh in 1989 to&#13;
1,936 GWh in 1993. Energy demand fell with the decline in economic activity, but the&#13;
sharper decline in energy production resulted in chronic power outages, severe coal&#13;
shortages, and inadequate supply of home heating. Without Soviet assistance, sufficient&#13;
spare parts, or enough funds to cover regular operating costs, maintenance and repairs,&#13;
the coal-power-heat system has fallen into serious disrepair. Output in the three main&#13;
coal mines and available firm capacity in the CHP plants both fell to about 65 percent of&#13;
design levels by 1993. Performance at each part of the system is now precarious and&#13;
notoriously unreliable. Although the decline in coal and electricity production was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
arrested in 1994, it has been difficult each winter to meet the minimum basic energy&#13;
needs of the urban population.&#13;
1.11  Energy production levels, and particularly the reliability of the coal-power-heat&#13;
system, must stabilize and then increase modestly to both overcome existing shortages&#13;
and provide sufficient energy for economic growth. Medium-term sector development&#13;
needs to focus on renovation and improvement of existing facilities.  Substantial&#13;
improvements in the efficiency of energy use can be achieved, with the greatest potential&#13;
for improvements existing in the electric power and district heating industries themselves.&#13;
C. ENERGY SECTOR INSTITUTIONS&#13;
1.12 The Ministry of Energy, Geology and Mines (MEGM) is the government agency&#13;
responsible for policy and regulation of the energy sector. It also remains heavily&#13;
involved in the operation of many of the various energy companies, although this&#13;
relationship is being reformed (paras. 1.15-1.17). MEGM's Mining Department is&#13;
responsible for coal production, while the Energy Department is responsible for heat and&#13;
power supply. Energy companies traditionally overseen by MEGM include (a) the&#13;
Central Energy System (CES), which is the umbrella organization responsible for the&#13;
main power grid, the five major CHP plants, and the associated district heating systems;&#13;
(b) the individual coal mines; (c) the Energy Utility Organizations (EUOs), supplying&#13;
heat and electricity in areas not covered by CES; (d) the Mongolian Petroleum Company,&#13;
in charge of petroleum exploration and development; and (e) the Nuurs Company, a state-&#13;
owned enterprise, which both assists MEGM in certain regulatory matters and is involved&#13;
in coal retail sales to small consumers and supply of equipment and spare parts for the&#13;
mines. Petroleum product imports, distribution and most sales are undertaken by the Neft&#13;
Import Concern (NIC).&#13;
D. SECTOR ISSUES AND STRATEGY&#13;
1.13  Expanded investment for the rehabilitation of Mongolia's coal-power-heat system&#13;
is critically needed to improve the reliability of supply and meet the needs of the&#13;
economy and urban population.  To provide sustainable results, however, sector&#13;
development efforts must address the underlying fundamental problems in the sector,&#13;
including pressing needs to modernize obsolete technology, improve operational&#13;
management, increase efficiency and reduce costs, and put energy companies on a&#13;
reasonable financial footing. During 1990-94, the Government and international donor&#13;
community successfully focused on short-term, emergency remedies to avoid a&#13;
devastating breakdown in the system during the winter months. As detailed in IDA's&#13;
recent energy sector report (Mongolia Energy Sector Review, Report 14586 MOG, 1995),&#13;
sector development must now focus on medium-term investments, institutional reform,&#13;
restructuring of energy companies, and energy price reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
Improving the Reliability of Energy Supply&#13;
1.14  Rehabilitation of existing coal mines, CHP plants and the district heating system&#13;
is the least-cost means over the medium term to provide primary fuel, baseload electric&#13;
power, and heating for currently connected heat consumers. Stable production of the&#13;
system will require completion of postponed basic repairs, selected improvements in&#13;
technology, improved company management, and an upgrading in manpower skills. Coal&#13;
sector needs include replacement of the obsolete rail overburden removal system at the&#13;
Baganuur mine with modem mobile equipment and investments to improve coal quality,&#13;
as well as basic repairs and equipment upgrading. Priorities in the CHP plants and&#13;
district heating systems include completion of major overhauls of boilers and auxiliary&#13;
facilities, reduction of system losses, and possible conversion of heating systems from&#13;
constant to variable flow. Renovation of the smaller, isolated electric power systems, in&#13;
addition to the main system, is also critical in some cases. Development of domestic&#13;
capacity to meet the power system's load variations and better regulate frequencies, as&#13;
opposed to the current dependence upon the interconnection with Russia in these areas,&#13;
also is a Govermment priority. In the petroleum sector, areas for focus include securing of&#13;
stable, long-term contracts for petroleum products at least cost and risk to the country,&#13;
and further exploration of domestic resources, followed by possible development.&#13;
Institutional Reform and Energy Company Restructuring&#13;
1.15  In addition to investment, sustainable gains in sector performance will require&#13;
improvements in management, operational efficiency and cost-control, through sector&#13;
reform. Under the planned economy, energy enterprises were managed and operated&#13;
essentially as subdepartments of MEGM, with insufficient accountability and incentives&#13;
for proper performance. Under the emerging market economy, efficiency improvements&#13;
can be achieved with clear separation of the roles and responsibilities of the government&#13;
and the companies, and increases in both the autonomy and accountability of the energy&#13;
companies. The Government is moving steadily in this direction, with the established&#13;
goal to transform MEGM into the policy and regulatory agency for the sector, transfer&#13;
operational management to the individual companies, and transfer ownership to the&#13;
private sector, public ownership overseen by a separate agency, or combinations of the&#13;
two. The legal underpinning for these reforms is being established through past and&#13;
proposed legislation on business entities, implementation of a new Minerals Law (that&#13;
includes coal mining), and preparation of a new Energy Law, focusing on the electricity&#13;
and heat subsectors.&#13;
1.16  During the first phase of Mongolia's privatization program, a number of small-&#13;
scale energy operations were fully privatized, including some of the smaller coal mines.&#13;
As a pilot case for large companies in the energy sector, the Baganuur Joint Stock&#13;
Company (BJSC) was restructured in June 1995 into a joint shareholding company, with&#13;
25 percent private ownership, and a new corporate governance structure (paras. 3.6-3.8).&#13;
Following on this experience, creation of additional shareholding companies is planned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
1.17 Virtually all energy companies urgently need to complete internal restructuring&#13;
reforms to improve efficiency. Company management must focus on improving financial&#13;
performance, improving maintenance, and increasing cost-consciousness and subunit&#13;
accountability. Internal financial management and reporting systems need to be&#13;
revamped, and, as in other Mongolian enterprises, the transition to International&#13;
Accounting Standards (IAS) must be completed.&#13;
Energy Pricing and Financial Sustainability&#13;
1.18  With the possible exception of NIC, the petroleum product supply company, the&#13;
financial position of Mongolia's main energy companies remains poor, and must be&#13;
improved for these companies to become sustainable commercial enterprises. Under the&#13;
centrally planned economy, pricing policy was geared to enable producers to meet cash&#13;
operating costs, with the Government, assisted with Soviet aid, providing capital&#13;
requirements. Reforms have now been initiated, but must be completed, to ensure&#13;
financial self-sufficiency of these companies.&#13;
1.19  The principal source of the financial problems is that revenue generated from&#13;
electricity and heat prices is too low, causing a lack of sufficient cash flow throughout the&#13;
energy system. In November 1994, the average price for electricity from CES was&#13;
increased by 28 percent to Tg 15.6 (¢3.5) per kWh, and the average heat price was&#13;
increased to Tg 30 (06.7) per square meter per month of heated space. Nevertheless, this&#13;
increase was insufficient to allow CES to recover financially, and in 1995 CES has&#13;
continued to be unable to fully meet its cash operating costs and major repair needs, let&#13;
alone make a contribution to the large investment required for renovation. Average&#13;
electricity prices, accounting for 80 percent of revenues, remain at 50 to 60 percent of&#13;
estimated long-run marginal cost (LRMC) levels, while heat prices are about 30 percent&#13;
of LRMC. CES's poor financial position has in turn helped cause cash shortages for the&#13;
coal mines, railways and petroleum suppliers, due to lack of payment for energy&#13;
deliveries. CES's accounts receivable to the coal mines and railways increased steadily&#13;
through early 1995, and only leveled off and declined during the later part of 1995,&#13;
following institution of new intercompany agreements (para. 1.22).&#13;
1.20 The Government recognizes that CES's revenues must be increased, and is&#13;
committed to improving CES's financial position through step-by-step output price&#13;
increases and implementation of programs to reduce losses and improve bill collection.&#13;
The Government is planning to increase electricity prices in 1996, beginning with an&#13;
expected increase of 15 to 20 percent. Substantial increases will be required, in both&#13;
electricity and heat prices, to fully restore CES's financial position and to ensure the&#13;
country's fiscal health.  With technical and nontechnical losses in the electricity&#13;
distribution system rising from about 290 GWh in 1993 to 445 GWh in 1994, successful&#13;
implementation of new efforts to reduce system losses could provide additional relief.&#13;
Further efforts are being made to reduce the level of accounts receivable. Although the&#13;
level of unpaid bills was not alarmingly high in October 1995, at the equivalent to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42 days of sales revenue, it has grown sharply since the 1994 price increase. Further IDA&#13;
assistance is planned in these areas (para. 1.23).&#13;
1.21  In mid-1994, coal prices were broadly sufficient to enable the main coal mines to&#13;
break even financially, and were generally close to the economic LRMC. However,&#13;
prices must be regularly adjusted to avoid erosion due to inflation and currency&#13;
devaluation. With no such adjustment during 1994 and 1995, coal prices have fallen&#13;
below economic cost and need to be increased in real terms to allow the sector to generate&#13;
enough funds for future investment (paras. 2.20-2.23). Average petroleum product prices&#13;
are tied in principle to international prices and economic cost, but there is a need to make&#13;
price adjustments less bureaucratic and more automatic.&#13;
1.22  With insufficient revenue entering the coal-power-heat system, energy companies&#13;
have become burdened with serious intercompany arrears. The situation improved&#13;
somewhat during the latter part of 1995. In the case of payments from the Ulaanbaatar&#13;
CHP plants to BJSC and Mongol Railways, for example, mutual agreements reached in&#13;
mid-1995, outlining full payments for coal deliveries and gradual payment of previously&#13;
incurred accounts payable, have been honored. The Government intends to continue its&#13;
efforts to make consumers more accountable to meet contractual obligations under the&#13;
law, and to adhere to intercompany agreements to gradually resolve the high accounts&#13;
receivable and payable built up over many months.&#13;
E. THE ROLE OF THE ASSOCIATION&#13;
1.23  In coordination with other donor agencies, and consistent with the emphasis on&#13;
removing infrastructure bottlenecks set out in the June 1995 Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS), the Association has developed a medium-term energy assistance program of&#13;
sector work, technical assistance and lending activities to support Mongolia's efforts to&#13;
rehabilitate and reform its energy sector. At the November 1994 international donors&#13;
meeting on Mongolia, the donor agencies and the Government agreed that investments to&#13;
stabilize energy production to meet the basic needs of the urban population and industrial&#13;
and commercial enterprises were an especially urgent priority. Accordingly, the Japanese&#13;
Government and Asian Development Bank agreed to finance rehabilitation investments in&#13;
the power and heat system, and IDA agreed to finance necessary accompanying&#13;
rehabilitation measures in the upstream coal subsector. A broad sector dialogue with the&#13;
Government and foundation for future assistance was established with completion of the&#13;
Mongolia Energy Sector Review in mid-1995. Planned IDA support during 1995-96&#13;
includes this proposed Coal Sector Project and technical assistance activities, executed&#13;
through the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), focusing on&#13;
electricity and heat price reform issues, implementation of an electric power loss&#13;
reduction program, measures to improve bill collection, and means to improve the&#13;
efficiency of operations and dispatch of the electricity and heat system. An additional&#13;
energy sector lending operation is proposed for FY98.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
1.24 Lessons Learned. Prior to the Sector Review, previous IDA involvement in&#13;
Mongolia's energy sector was limited to modest emergency assistance for the coal&#13;
industry, as part of Economic Rehabilitation Credit (1991) and Economic Transition&#13;
Support Credit (1993). This assistance, coordinated closely with that of other donors,&#13;
successfully helped to avert a collapse in coal, power and heat production. However, the&#13;
experience of the emergency donor assistance efforts in the sector also showed that&#13;
support to meet urgent replacement equipment and spare parts needs, coupled with short-&#13;
term technical assistance efforts, could only at best provide a temporary stop-gap solution&#13;
to the sector's deterioration in performance. Experience has shown that sustainable&#13;
improvements in performance will require support for more concentrated, medium-term&#13;
investments in technology modernization, coupled with policy reforms and company&#13;
restructuring to provide incentives for critical improvements in productivity, maintenance&#13;
and operations management.&#13;
1.25  Experience in the only sector investment project in Mongolia approved to date,&#13;
the Transport Rehabilitation Project (1994), has shown the importance of institutional&#13;
strengthening to achieve smooth project implementation. In the proposed project, the&#13;
potential risks for project implementation of weak institutional capabilities are mitigated&#13;
substantially as only one beneficiary is involved in the investment program. The&#13;
management team of the beneficiary, BJSC, prepared the full Project Implementation&#13;
Plan, with international technical assistance and close IDA supervision.  BJSC's&#13;
management team will continue to be responsible for project implementation, utilizing&#13;
substantial project technical assistance and training where necessary.&#13;
1.26  IDA experience in coal projects in other countries has been mixed, with some&#13;
successes and some disappointing results. Where problems have developed, this has been&#13;
due to sector and institutional difficulties and the "greenfield" nature of the projects.&#13;
Although several new projects are under preparation, lending for coal production in&#13;
recent years, in the former Soviet Union or eastern Europe for example, has been&#13;
constrained by insufficient institutional reform, massive work force reduction&#13;
requirements, and large cross-subsidies in coal pricing systems. The proposed operation&#13;
is far simpler than most, focusing on the rehabilitation of one existing mining operation,&#13;
which already has an infrastructure base, trained manpower, and well-established output&#13;
marketing arrangements.  To ensure smooth project implementation, institutional&#13;
improvements at the mine and necessary changes in its operating environment have been&#13;
stressed in project preparation and are emphasized in project design and credit&#13;
conditionality.&#13;
Role of This Project&#13;
1.27  IDA's first energy operation in Mongolia, the proposed project is part of a&#13;
coordinated effort of the international donors to provide assistance, on an urgent basis, to&#13;
stabilize production and improve the reliability of Mongolia's core energy infrastructure,&#13;
required to support the country's urban economy and population. The project includes&#13;
medium-term investments to modernize mining methods and stabilize production at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
designed levels at the Baganuur coal mine, which is the main source of primary energy&#13;
for the urban energy system. The project also supports the restructuring of one of the&#13;
largest energy companies into a commercially focused joint public/private shareholding&#13;
company. The project supports completion of the corporate restructuring of the Baganuur&#13;
Joint Stock Company, intemal reorganization of operations, conversion to international&#13;
accounting standards, and implementation of improved mechanisms to monitor&#13;
performance and improve cost control. Also, in support of the Mongolia CAS objectives&#13;
to support public enterprise reform and expansion of the role of the private sector, IDA&#13;
would provide support for the implementation of Mongolia's first pilot case in the coal-&#13;
power-heat system to transform a major enterprise into a more commercially managed,&#13;
independent and financially accountable business.&#13;
1.28  Donor Coordination.  This project is designed to complement parallel&#13;
investment projects of other donor agencies focusing primarily on the CHP plants. The&#13;
Asian Development Bank (ADB) and bilateral agencies of Japan, the United States,&#13;
Germany and Denmark, as well as IDA, have all been particularly active in Mongolia's&#13;
energy sector, and coordination of activities between these agencies has been good.&#13;
Formal coordination in the context of the annual donor Assistance Group Meetings on&#13;
Mongolia is supplemented by active informal coordination. In 1995, ADB and the&#13;
Danish Intemational Development Agency (DANIDA) began implementation of a $35&#13;
million assistance package for renovation of Ulaanbaatar's Number 3 CHP plant, and&#13;
Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) approved an assistance package&#13;
of about $45 million for renovation of Ulaanbaatar's Number 4 CHP plant. The proposed&#13;
IDA coal operation would support the rehabilitation and restructuring of the upstream&#13;
component of the coal-power-heat system. The Japanese Government provided financial&#13;
assistance to Mongolia to help prepare the project, and the Overseas Economic&#13;
Cooperation Fund, Japan, has indicated that it will provide parallel cofinancing for&#13;
project implementation.&#13;

2. THE COAL SUBSECTOR&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
Reserves&#13;
2.1    Virtually all of the coal currently mined in Mongolia is lignite, with heating&#13;
values generally of 2,700 to 4,000 kcal/kg, 18 to 35 percent moisture, and 12 to&#13;
21 percent ash. The principal exploitable lignite reserves total some 750 million tons.&#13;
Although essentially undeveloped at this time, due to very large infrastructure&#13;
requirements, large reserves of very high-quality coal (8,000 kcal/kg, 8.5 percent&#13;
moisture, 20 percent ash) also have been identified at Tavan Togoi in the Gobi Desert.&#13;
Except at Shive Ovoo coal (1.5 percent), all coals in Mongolia are low in sulfur (less than&#13;
I percent).&#13;
Production Trends&#13;
2.2    There are 16 coal mines operating in Mongolia. These include three large-scale&#13;
mines at Baganuur, Sharyn Gol and Shive Ovoo serving the main urban markets; one&#13;
medium-scale operation (0.6 million tons per year, or Mtpy) far to the east at&#13;
Aduunchuluun, and 12 small mines (less than 0.25 Mtpy), serving only local "aimag"&#13;
(provincial) markets.  All of the coal mines except one small mine are open-pit&#13;
operations.&#13;

2.3    Declines in Output. As shown in Table 2.1, total coal production fell steadily&#13;
every year during 1989-93, due primarily to steady deterioration of equipment, lack of&#13;
spare parts, and insufficient overburden removal in previous years. Production fell by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
36 percent, before leveling off in 1994. With an original capacity of 4 Mtpy and ample&#13;
reserves for production well into the next century, the Baganuur mine is the backbone of&#13;
the sector. In 1993 and 1994, production at Baganuur had fallen to only 70 percent of&#13;
designed capacity. Production at Sharyn Gol has fallen steadily to just 1.1 million tons in&#13;
1994, compared to its designed capacity of 1.5 Mtpy. Shive Ovoo is a new mine, where&#13;
production has not yet met the capacity of 1.2 Mtpy originally planned, in part due to coal&#13;
quality problems.&#13;
2.4   Production Costs. Long-term production costs at Baganuur are estimated at&#13;
$7.10 per ton, due to the favorable mining conditions and low stripping ratios. At the&#13;
older Sharyn Gol mine, sustained future production will cost easily twice as much as at&#13;
Baganuur. With modest rehabilitation investment, Sharyn Gol could continue production&#13;
through the end of the decade at average incremental costs of about $8 to $10/ton, by&#13;
concentrating production on the most accessible deposits at low stripping ratios. By&#13;
about 2000, however, the mine will encounter stripping ratios of 6:1 or higher, and costs&#13;
that are unlikely to be sustainable. The medium-term future for Shive Ovoo remains&#13;
uncertain. With a projected long-term stripping ratio of about 3.5:1, the mine may be&#13;
able to produce at unit costs similar to those at Baganuur, but the quality of coal produced&#13;
must be greatly improved to be acceptable to consumers.&#13;
2.5   Coal Quality. The quality of the coal produced at the three major mines varies&#13;
substantially.  The mine at Baganuur produces medium-quality lignite (3,200 to&#13;
3,500 kcal/kg). Sharyn Gol produces the highest quality coal of the three (3,800 to&#13;
4,000 kcal/kg). Sharyn Gol coal is favored by a number of consumers, who would need&#13;
to make significant adjustments to use lower-quality lignites. Although Shive Ovoo was&#13;
expected to produce coal of 3,300 kcal/kg quality, this new mine has been delivering coal&#13;
of only 2,700 kcal/kg or less, with moisture contents in excess of 40 percent. Substantial&#13;
amounts of fuel oil must be added to maintain proper combustion at the CHP plants, at&#13;
unacceptable costs. Measures recommended in a recent study completed by the Japan&#13;
International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to improve coal quality at Shive Ovoo include&#13;
implementation of a strict quality control program, abandonment of current practices of&#13;
shipping oxidized coal to consumers, installation of a mine dewatering system,&#13;
construction of a crushing and sizing plant, and measures to remove thin interburden&#13;
high-ash material from output. Even with these measures, however, the study concludes&#13;
that it may be necessary for consumers to install coal-drying systems, adding to their&#13;
costs. '&#13;
2.6    Trade Prospects.  Lignites such as those currently mined in Mongolia are&#13;
generally not suitable for international trade due to their low quality, and hence high&#13;
transportation cost per unit of energy. At times, small quantities of coal have been&#13;
Further information on the coal sector in general, and Shive Ovoo mine in particular, is available in&#13;
Study of Comprehensive Coal Development and Utilization in Mongolia (Final Report Summary,&#13;
November 1995), completed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
shipped to Russia or small amounts have been imported to make up for periodic&#13;
production deficiencies in Mongolia. Given their high ash and moisture content, and low&#13;
calorific value, however, the high costs of transporting Mongolian lignite to Russia or&#13;
China make exports uneconomic. On the other hand, given the low cost of production,&#13;
relatively short distances internally from mine to market, and fact that Mongolia's CHP&#13;
plants were designed to burn such low-quality coal, production of these lignites clearly&#13;
remains the least-cost source of coal supply domestically. With the possible exception of&#13;
high-quality coals for selected special applications, importation of coal for use by the&#13;
main consumers is not economically competitive (paras. 6.4-6.5).&#13;
B. COAL DEMAND&#13;
2.7   Current Coal Use. The three large coal mines provide all of the coal used by the&#13;
five CHP plants of CES, the country's main industries, and most of the small consumers&#13;
in the main urban centers (see Table 2.2). The medium and small mines provide coal for&#13;
local heat systems and other local consumers in the smaller, isolated towns. CES is by&#13;
far the largest consumer of coal, accounting for 65 percent of national coal use, and&#13;
78 percent of the output of the three mines. The largest and newest CES plant, the&#13;
Number 4 CHP plant in Ulaanbaatar, was designed to burn Baganuur coal, although plant&#13;
managers have tried, with little success, to blend some Shive Ovoo coal into the supply&#13;
mix. The older CHP plants were designed to burn the higher-quality coal from Sharyn&#13;
Gol, but with the steady downturn in Sharyn Gol's output they also have been using&#13;
Baganuur coal. As part of its rehabilitation program supported by the ADB, the Number&#13;
3 CHP plant in Ulaanbaatar is making adjustments to its boilers to allow full conversion&#13;
to Baganuur coal. Other plants may follow this course during the later 1 990s.&#13;
2.8   Key industries, which generally prefer Sharyn Gol coal, if available, account for&#13;
about 9 percent of the sales from the three mines. Small-scale users, consisting primarily&#13;
of households and commercial or public establishments not connected to the district&#13;
heating system, accounted for about 15 percent of sales.&#13;
2.9   Serious coal shortages have been experienced during recent winter seasons. Coal&#13;
stockpiles at the CHP plants have fallen to dangerously low levels each year. Coupled&#13;
with chronic problems of boiler availability at the CHP plants, insufficient supplies of&#13;
coal of acceptable quality have led to declines in heating service such that temperature&#13;
levels in many urban homes fall to unacceptably low levels in winter. In the informal&#13;
market, coal shortages have caused prices for supply outside of regular channels to rise to&#13;
some three times the actual cost of delivery.&#13;

2.10   Future Coal Demand. Levels of future coal demand in Mongolia are uncertain,&#13;
and current estimates vary widely, due to uncertainties concerning the extent of&#13;
suppressed coal demand as a result of supply shortages, and uncertainties concerning&#13;
future growth in industrial electricity and coal demand. MEGM's low-case coal demand&#13;
projections for the main mine service area show a rise to about 6.9 million tons in 2000&#13;
and 8.3 million tons in 2005. Estimates prepared for the JICA study on coal development&#13;
show an increase in demand in the same market to 6.4 to 6.8 million tons in 2000 and 7.9&#13;
to 8.6 million tons in 2005, based on the Government's projections of strong industrial&#13;
growth. Table 2.3 presents a conservative view of future supply and demand, which&#13;
assumes far lower rates of growth in industrial electricity and coal demand. In this&#13;
conservative projection, coal demand in the CES-based service area rises to only 5.8&#13;
million tons in 2000 and 6.4 million tons in 2005. The projections focus only on the&#13;
CES-based service area supplied through the three large mines, as other, isolated service&#13;
areas are supplied by local mines, with little potential for market interaction, due to&#13;
transportation constraints.&#13;
2.11   The conservative projections show the effects of a recovery in district heating&#13;
service and stabilization in electric power production in the CES system by 1997, enabled&#13;
through a combination of boiler rehabilitation measures at Ulaanbaatar CHP Plants 3 and&#13;
4, with international support, and rehabilitation of the Baganuur coal mine. Coal&#13;
consumption in CES rises to its 1990 level, but remains well under levels in the late&#13;
1980s. After 1997, CES consumption grows only modestly, as efficiency improvements&#13;
moderate demand growth stemming from economic growth.&#13;

2.12   Role of Baganuur. Baganuur is certain to remain the core mine for the economy&#13;
well into the next decade, due to its position as the nation's stable low-cost producer. Of&#13;
the three mines, Baganuur is the only mine that can guarantee a high level of output of&#13;
acceptable quality at a low cost over the long term. At Sharyn Gol, costs would increase&#13;
sharply if overburden removal were to keep pace with long-term production&#13;
requirements. At Shive Ovoo, coal quality issues must be solved at an acceptable cost for&#13;
the mine to play a significant role. In the event that these are resolved, output levels of&#13;
0.8 Mtpy can be maintained with the existing equipment, and output could be expanded&#13;
with new investment to 2.0 Mtpy.&#13;
2.13   If demand increases faster than portrayed in the conservative estimates, including,&#13;
for example, commissioning of a new mine-mouth power plant early next century, output&#13;
at Baganuur could be increased further with relative ease. Production levels of 6.0 Mtpy&#13;
could be sustained at Baganuur with further investment along the lines proposed under&#13;
the project. The incremental costs of new production also will be significantly lower than&#13;
average costs. If total demand increases slower than portrayed in Table 2.3, this would&#13;
result in lower sales from Shive Ovoo, as coal from this mine is the least preferred by&#13;
consumers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
C. COAL SUBSECTOR ISSUES AND REFORM STRATEGY2&#13;
2.14  Mine Rehabilitation and Modernization. Serious technical problems constrain&#13;
production levels and operational efficiency at all three of Mongolia's main mines. The&#13;
Government's top priority for subsector investment is to rehabilitate the Baganuur mine,&#13;
followed by investigation and implementation of measures to improve coal quality at&#13;
Shive Ovoo, and then further expansion of Shive Ovoo's output. At Baganuur and&#13;
Sharyn Gol, the Russian-designed railway overburden removal systems are obsolete. The&#13;
inflexibility of these systems restricts the entire overburden removal and coal production&#13;
system. At Baganuur, coal production cannot be significantly increased with the existing&#13;
railway system. Operating costs for the railway are too high, including high demands for&#13;
spare parts and heavy repair requirements. At Baganuur, the site conditions warrant&#13;
transition to a fully mobile truck/shovel operation, increasing output at lower unit cost.&#13;
At Sharyn Gol, however, similar large investments to rehabilitate the mine are not&#13;
considered economic, given the substantially higher stripping ratios and unit operating&#13;
costs anticipated over the longer term.&#13;
2.15  Sorting, sizing and mixing facilities at all three mines to achieve the necessary&#13;
conformity in coal quality are either totally lacking or inadequate, causing unnecessary&#13;
and unsatisfactory problems for consumers. A new coal-handling plant needs to be&#13;
constructed at Baganuur to replace the existing inadequate facilities. The existing plant at&#13;
Sharyn Gol should be modestly upgraded. At Shive Ovoo, improvement in coal quality,&#13;
including the addition of coal-handling facilities, is critical (para. 2.5).&#13;
2.16  Commercialization and Improving Efficiency.  Investments alone will not&#13;
stabilize Mongolia's coal production; subsector and mine management also must be&#13;
improved. In the past, inefficient operating practices, poor equipment productivity and&#13;
maintenance, and lack of cost control have been principal causes of the coal subsector's&#13;
poor performance. To improve efficiency, the critical areas for reform at this time&#13;
include: (a) separation of coal companies from the government; (b) development of coal&#13;
companies into commercial enterprises; and (c) development of market forces, reform of&#13;
coal prices, and creation of a stable financial operating environment for coal companies.&#13;
2.17  The Government is committed to implementation of these reforms in the coal&#13;
subsector, as part of the transition to a market economy. Although further actions are still&#13;
required, substantial progress has been made during 1994-95 to build the necessary&#13;
legislative framework. At this stage, it is important to proceed with the details of&#13;
implementation.  The Government has selected BJSC as the first pilot case for&#13;
implementing the reform of a large state-owned company in the coal-power-heat system.&#13;
iith support under the proposed project, BJSC will operate as the first independent&#13;
shareholding company in the coal subsector, designed to operate commercially under the&#13;
market system, financially self-sufficient, and separate from MEGM management.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
2.18 Redefinition of Government and Company Roles. Under the centrally-planned&#13;
economic system operated in Mongolia, MEGM has been heavily involved in the day-to-&#13;
day management of the main mines, and the responsibilities of MEGM and mine&#13;
management have been intertwined and indistinct. Lack of clear accountability has been&#13;
one of the most critical factors leading to inefficient mine management. To operate more&#13;
effectively, Mongolia's coal companies must be established as independent commercial&#13;
entities, separate from the Government, and fully accountable to their shareholders for&#13;
performance. The role of the Government in subsector policy, regulation, and public&#13;
ownership (where relevant) also must be clearly delineated. The Government has been&#13;
active on both fronts during 1994-95:&#13;
* Corporatization and Privatization. Under the Government's privatization&#13;
program, several small coal mines have been fully privatized, and among the&#13;
large ones, Baganuur has been incorporated as a joint stock company with&#13;
25 percent private ownership.  For the large mines, the significance of&#13;
participation in the Government's privatization program lies as much in the&#13;
creation of autonomous, independent companies, operating under the strictures&#13;
of the Partnership and Companies Law and legally recognized Company&#13;
Charters, as in the introduction of minority private-sector ownership.&#13;
Participation of other mines in the program is expected. One important issue&#13;
still to be resolved concerns final definition of which public agency will have&#13;
authority to act for the Government as the owner of public shares (para. 3.9).&#13;
* Regulatory Reform. The Government has set a clear overall policy direction&#13;
to cast sector ministries such as MEGM in a policy/regulatory role without&#13;
involvement in company operations and management. In the mining industry,&#13;
the new Minerals Law provides, in principle, for a workable legal framework&#13;
for mineral operations in the country. MEGM has been assigned, and is&#13;
beginning to dispatch, much of the regulatory responsibilities under the law,&#13;
with assistance in some matters, as directed by MEGM, from the Nuurs&#13;
Company (para. 3.10). However, the transition from the old system is not yet&#13;
complete. Detailed regulations and implementation measures still need to be&#13;
worked out or fine-tuned in some areas. While significant institutional&#13;
changes already have occurred in MEGM, further formal institutional changes&#13;
within the ministry will be required to fulfill its emerging new role.&#13;
2.19  Coal Company Restructuring. Especially under a regime of greater autonomy&#13;
and accountability, mine company management needs to be greatly improved to increase&#13;
efficiency. The Government's goal is to improve cost-consciousness and manage mining&#13;
companies as project-oriented businesses. Priority areas include (a) development of&#13;
corporate management capabilities, (b) restructuring and strengthening of financial&#13;
management and accounting practices, and (c) improvement in organization and practices&#13;
for supervision of mine operations. A comprehensive restructuring program at Baganuur,&#13;
supported under the proposed project, is detailed in Chapter 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
Coal Pricing and Increasing Subsector Financial Performance&#13;
2.20 Reform of the Pricing and Allocation System. Under the centrally planned&#13;
economy, the Government allocated the output of each mine to various consumers and&#13;
fixed all coal prices. Coal prices were last fixed in 1993, and have basically been retained&#13;
at those levels through 1995. Ex-mine prices for Baganuur's output have remained at&#13;
Tg 2,500/ton ($5.56/ton at the 1995 average exchange rate) through 1995. Ex-mine&#13;
prices for Sharyn Gol's relatively high-quality coal are substantially higher, at about&#13;
Tg 3,500/ton ($7.78/ton) in 1995. Ex-mine prices for the low-quality coal produced at&#13;
Shive Ovoo to date are low, at about Tg 2,200/ton ($4.89/ton). Prices are sufficient to&#13;
cover cash operating costs, but without adjustment to compensate for inflation and a&#13;
decline in the value of the tugrik, 1995 price levels were insufficient to fully cover&#13;
depreciation charges based on international accounting standards.&#13;
2.21  The system is being reformed to better meet the needs of the market economy and&#13;
use market forces to improve efficiency. The characteristics of Mongolia's coal market&#13;
poses some constraints on proper market competition, however. The country's small and&#13;
medium mines serve only isolated markets, due to geographic and transportation&#13;
constraints. The main market in Ulaanbaatar, Darkhan and Erdenet is dominated by CES,&#13;
which accounts for 78 percent of consumption. This market is basically served only by&#13;
the three main mines, led by Baganuur, which accounts for 80 percent of supply.&#13;
Accordingly, both CES and Baganuur have market-dominating positions.&#13;
2.22  During 1995, two reforms have been initiated, which improve upon the old&#13;
system by giving greater play to market forces:&#13;
(a)   In a reform of the allocation system, coal supply contracts between&#13;
individual mines and consumers were introduced in 1995, negotiated&#13;
directly between the parties. Within CES, each CHP plant is allowed to&#13;
enter into its own contracts. These contracts outline the responsibilities of&#13;
each party and provide for: (i) quantity, quality specification (heat, ash&#13;
and moisture content) and timing of delivery; (ii) payment terms;&#13;
(iii) penalties and premiums relating to quality, delivery and payment&#13;
terms; (iv) arbitration provisions in the event of dispute; and (v) the right&#13;
to withhold or terminate deliveries in the event of default.&#13;
(b)   Prices for the output of Sharyn Gol, Shive Ovoo and many of the smaller&#13;
mines are beginning to be allowed to float according to market forces.&#13;
This trend should be strongly encouraged, particularly to provide market&#13;
signals to producers concerning the value that consumers attach to&#13;
differences in coal quality.&#13;
2.23  Due to its dominant market position, prices for Baganuur's output will need to&#13;
continue to be regulated by the Government. With a ceiling set by the price of equivalent&#13;
imported coal, the price must be adjusted regularly to account for depreciation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
tugrik and to allow BJSC to cover costs, service its debt, and generate a reasonable after&#13;
tax return on the funds employed by the company (para. 5.16).&#13;
2.24 Improving the Financial Operating Environment. Mongolia's coal companies&#13;
suffered from severe cash flow shortages during 1994 and early 1995 due to lack of full&#13;
payment for coal deliveries by the CHP plants. The situation improved in the latter half&#13;
of 1995: since July, the CES and CHP Plants 3 and 4 paid for all new coal deliveries&#13;
from Baganuur, based on a formal agreement between BJSC, CES, the CHP plants and&#13;
Mongol Railways. The Government is also stressing that coal supply contracts must be&#13;
enforced according to the law. Continued timely payment for coal deliveries is the most&#13;
important single measure needed to improve the financial performance of the coal&#13;
companies. Additional issues include the need to gradually resolve the outstanding&#13;
accounts receivable from the CHP plants, and the need to enable the companies to retain&#13;
sufficient depreciation funds, before income tax remittance, in accordance with the&#13;
international accounting standards being adopted in 1996 (paras. 5.17-5.18).&#13;
&#13;

3. THE BENEFICIARY&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
3.1   The project beneficiary is the Baganuur Joint Stock Company (BJSC), which&#13;
operates the country's largest coal mine at Baganuur. Coal mining operations began at&#13;
Baganuur in 1978. In June 1995, BJSC, the operating company, was incorporated as a&#13;
joint stock company (paras. 3.6-3.8).&#13;
3.2   Institutional Background. The Baganuur mine is located in Baganuur District,&#13;
under the administration of Ulaanbaatar City. With Soviet assistance, the mine began to&#13;
produce substantial amounts of coal in the early 1980s. Original plans were for a 6&#13;
million tons per year (Mtpy) operation, but the capacity actually developed was closer to&#13;
4 Mtpy. Even this level was only achieved in the peak production year of 1988, when&#13;
stripping ratios were particularly low-mine production has always been hampered by&#13;
the outdated, inflexible and cumbersome railroad overburden removal system. With the&#13;
withdrawal of large-scale Soviet aid to the mine, the economic crisis of the early 1990s,&#13;
and chronic cash shortages, the mine has struggled to keep its equipment operating.&#13;
Production has fallen sharply from 3.7 to 3.8 million tons in 1989-91 to 2.8 to 2.9 million&#13;
tons in 1993-94. Production will undoubtedly fall further unless major rehabilitation&#13;
investments are made.&#13;
3.3   Until 1995, the mine was fully government owned and was basically managed as&#13;
a department of MEGM. All major decisions were referred to MEGM, and the Ministry&#13;
also was involved in many aspects of day-to-day operations. The relative responsibilities&#13;
of MEGM and mine managers remained unclear, leading to a lack of accountability in&#13;
mine management and operation. However, with the establishment of the Baganuur mine&#13;
as a shareholding company and promulgation of the Minerals Law in 1995, a foundation&#13;
now has been put in place for the development of Baganuur into an independent,&#13;
commercially-focused company, separate from MEGM management.&#13;
3.4   Mine Management and Efficiency Issues. Mine performance at Baganuur has&#13;
suffered not only because of the use of outdated technology and financial problems, but&#13;
also because of ineffective management and poor operational organization and&#13;
supervision, stemming in part from lack of accountability. The productivity of equipment&#13;
has been poor, with equipment operating only at an average of 6 hours per 12-hour shift.&#13;
This is caused by inadequate supervision at the mine and poor equipment maintenance&#13;
practices. The prevailing mine organizational structure has caused inefficiencies due to&#13;
(a) a sharing of responsibilities for mine production among separate departments, and&#13;
insufficient coordination in interdependent operational activities; (b) lack of focused&#13;
responsibility for maintenance work; and (c) an overly complex structure, with many dual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
reporting relationships.  Operational supervision is weak and ineffective, due to&#13;
inadequate supervisor mobility, competence and compensation, and lack of adequate&#13;
performance standards. Training for staff at all levels is unstructured and insufficient.&#13;
Management of equipment maintenance is poor, including preventive and scheduled&#13;
maintenance, linkages with operations, and warehouse and inventory control. The mine&#13;
is also significantly overstaffed.&#13;
3.5    Restructuring  Initiatives.   Following  the  incorporation  of BJSC, the&#13;
Government and BJSC management have initiated a major restructuring of the Baganuur&#13;
operation, in order to establish a more autonomous and commercially-focused company,&#13;
and to improve efficiency. BJSC has launched an internal reorganization (para. 3.11), a&#13;
manpower reduction program (para. 3.12), initiatives to improve mine operational&#13;
management and supervision (para. 3.13), a major program to improve maintenance&#13;
management (para. 3.14), and a program to improve financial reporting and cost control&#13;
(paras. 3.15-3.16).  Substantial progress has already been achieved, as BJSC has&#13;
developed a separate institutional identity and a capable company management team has&#13;
been put in place. As detailed in Chapter 4, the proposed project will provide extensive&#13;
training and technical assistance to further reinforce these initiatives.&#13;
B. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BAGANUUR JOINT STOCK COMPANY&#13;
3.6    Corporatization  and Privatization  Process.   The Baganuur Joint Stock&#13;
Company (BJSC) was duly incorporated as a joint stock company on June 8, 1995, under&#13;
the Law on Business Entities. BJSC's Charter was fornally adopted in a shareholders'&#13;
meeting on March 25, 1995. At that meeting BJSC's Board of Directors was also&#13;
appointed. The Government holds 75 percent of the company shares, while private&#13;
individuals hold 25 percent. As a legal entity under this law, BJSC has all requisite&#13;
power and authority to conduct business and enter into agreements with Mongolian and&#13;
foreign legal persons within or outside Mongolia.&#13;
3.7    BJSC was selected in 1993 by Mongolia's State Privatization Commission (SPC)&#13;
as a pilot case for privatization of a large infrastructure company. Although a number of&#13;
small coal mines have been privatized, BJSC is the first large energy company to&#13;
participate in the country's privatization program. In line with the Government's Phase&#13;
One privatization program, 25 percent ownership was offered to interested Mongolian&#13;
citizens, in exchange for "blue" vouchers previously distributed to the citizenry.3&#13;
Approximately 5.2 million BJSC shares were sold to about 26,600 persons through the&#13;
Mongolian Stock Exchange. Following the initiation of Phase Two of the privatization&#13;
3 Under the Phase I program, begun in 1991, all citizens receive three "pink" vouchers to exchange for&#13;
shares in small firms, and one "blue" voucher, valued at Tg 7,000, to exchange for shares in large&#13;
companies selected by SPC for participation in the program. Individuals "purchase" shares with their&#13;
vouchers, with the assistance of brokers, through the Mongolian Stock Exchange. The Phase I&#13;
program was successfully concluded on June 30, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
program on July 1, 1995, BJSC shares are now eligible for trading between individuals,&#13;
through the Stock Exchange.&#13;
3.8   Company Charter. BJSC's Charter is based, in principle, on the Law on&#13;
Business Entities and has been a useful starting point for the company. Following advice&#13;
from IDA, and considering needs to adapt the Charter to the requirements of the new&#13;
Partnership and Companies Law (replacing the Business Entities Law), BJSC is&#13;
completing appropriate modifications in the Charter.&#13;
3.9   Company Ownership and Governance. Currently in Mongolia, the relevant&#13;
sector ministry is responsible for representing the Government as shareholder in joint&#13;
stock companies. In BJSC's case, therefore, MEGM acts for the Government as&#13;
shareholder. The Government recognizes that this is not satisfactory under market&#13;
conditions, as such sector ministries also are responsible for the implementation of&#13;
government sector policy and regulation, and conflicts of interest must inevitably arise.&#13;
The Government is in the process of establishing a system whereby government&#13;
ownership responsibilities will be held by an agency fully independent from the sector&#13;
ministries. As this is of critical importance for the proper functioning of BJSC as a&#13;
commercial company, assurances were obtained from the Government at negotiations&#13;
that the Government will adopt a plan, by no later than December 31, 1996, satisfactory&#13;
to the Association, for the transfer of the authority to exercise all rights and the&#13;
requirement to fulfill all obligations of the Borrower in its capacity as shareholder of&#13;
BJSC from MEGM to an entity fully independent from MEGM and any other&#13;
organization, agency or individual with responsibilities for any aspect of energy or&#13;
mining sector policy or regulation.&#13;
3. 10  Government Regulation. The new Minerals Law provides the legal framework&#13;
for the conduct of minerals operations in Mongolia. Minerals are owned by the state and&#13;
the state can restrict the free sale of products on the market, oblige a mining company to&#13;
sell to the state and set minimum and maximum production levels. The law is&#13;
administered at five different levels of government. The law allows MEGM to delegate&#13;
some of its regulatory responsibilities, which it has done to the Nuurs Company (a public&#13;
enterprise). Under the Minerals Law, BJSC has obtained a mining license (30 years)&#13;
from MEGM and entered into a surface rights (30 years) and a mining lease agreement&#13;
(30 years) with the local authorities and Nuurs Company, respectively. Following an&#13;
evaluation by the Ministry of Environment, BJSC received on August 29, 1995 an&#13;
environmental permit for implementation of the proposed project.&#13;
C. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF BJSC&#13;
3.11  Company Reorganization. BJSC has developed a new institutional organization&#13;
which is being implemented in April 1996. The new structure (see Annex3.Z1) is&#13;
designed to meet the needs of the new commercial company; accommodate the shift in&#13;
mine technology and new mine development plan; and improve production efficiency and&#13;
equipment maintenance. The structure was developed with international technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
assistance and the collective input of key mine management personnel. Under the&#13;
direction of the company's Board of nine Directors, elected by the shareholders, BJSC's&#13;
core management team is led by the mine's Executive Director, and includes four Deputy&#13;
Directors. Several key changes from the previous structure include (a) simplification of&#13;
management organization, to include four deputy directors, as opposed to six previously;&#13;
(b) consolidation of the production function into one department, to provide for more&#13;
effective assignment of production support equipment, improve haul road construction,&#13;
and increase operating hours of key equipment; and (c) establish a stronger maintenance&#13;
function, separate from the production function and headed by a deputy director.&#13;
3.12 Manpower Reduction Program. Similar to many state-owned enterprises in the&#13;
former planned economies, the work force at BJSC is substantially larger than the&#13;
international norm. Although labor is not a large cost item for BJSC's mechanized open-&#13;
pit operation, the company has developed a program to reduce manpower to improve&#13;
efficiency. From a level of about 1,640 workers in mid-1994, staff at BJSC had been&#13;
reduced to 1,507 workers by October 1995, primarily through natural attrition and&#13;
dismissals for disciplinary reasons.  The company's program  calls for additional&#13;
reductions of about 600 staff, to a level of 907 by 2000. BJSC plans to shift employees&#13;
from less productive or redundant assignments to others where they are needed most,&#13;
given the planned mine technology change, reductions in the scope of social activities of&#13;
the company, and changed emphasis in the new organizational structure. Employees in&#13;
the former railroad and prestripping section will fall by about 278 persons. Substantial&#13;
cuts will be made in the transportation and mining equipment maintenance section,&#13;
reflecting the phasing out of obsolete equipment, revised operations and new maintenance&#13;
procedures. Management functions (e.g., corporate strategy and planning, finance,&#13;
personnel, and procurement) will be strengthened. The social support department,&#13;
overseeing a hotel, sanitarium, canteen and livestock herd, is scheduled for divestiture&#13;
and privatization in 1998. The bulk of the manpower reduction will be achieved through&#13;
natural attrition. IDA supports BJSC's program, but has insisted that maximum efforts&#13;
be made to minimize social hardship of those affected (paras. 4.33-4.34 and Annex4.11).&#13;
3.13  Mine Operational Management and Supervision.  Ineffective operational&#13;
management and supervision have led to inefficiency and low equipment and labor&#13;
productivity in the past. The concentration of all production-related activities together,&#13;
and associated management streamlining, under the new organization will help overcome&#13;
past problems. In addition, BJSC is undertaking a series of initiatives to upgrade the role&#13;
and effectiveness of mine supervisors and foremen. In 1995, the company provided&#13;
vehicles to increase supervisor mobility in the mine area, and purchased mobile&#13;
communications equipment to facilitate regular contact between mine management and&#13;
all foremen and supervisors overseeing major mine excavation and transportation&#13;
equipment. BJSC management is planning to adjust the compensation scheme for mine&#13;
personnel, to improve the stature of supervisors and foremen, and increase incentives to&#13;
pursue promotion. Plans also include a full review, and adjustment where required, of&#13;
operational and supervisory procedures and guidelines. Training and technical assistance&#13;
will be provided under the project (para. 4.13).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
3.14  Mine Maintenance. Poor maintenance of mine equipment and facilities has been&#13;
a major cause of low equipment productivity. Fully recognizing the inadequacy of the&#13;
existing arrangements, and following a thorough review of necessary improvements, with&#13;
the assistance of international experts, BJSC will implement a full restructuring of its&#13;
maintenance and materials management system. In addition to creation of a separate&#13;
mine maintenance and materials management function under the new institutional&#13;
structure, the program includes, with support under the project (para. 4.13): (a) upgrading&#13;
of facilities with the provision of modem workshop equipment and tools and an adequate&#13;
stock of spare parts; (b) development of a maintenance planning capability, based on a&#13;
systematic approach to work identification and documentation; (c) development of a&#13;
proper maintenance scheduling system; (d) development, for the first time, of a&#13;
preventative maintenance program and agenda; (e) a complete overhaul of the materials&#13;
and spare parts management system; and (f) staff training (see Annex 4.2).&#13;
3.15  Financial Control and Accounting. Mongolia, and BJSC, have followed the old&#13;
Soviet system of financial reporting and accounting. This system comprised a rigid&#13;
reporting structure with a common code of accounts for all companies. It was designed to&#13;
report to central government on operations in terms of meeting production targets and the&#13;
recording and control of the company's assets and liabilities and provided little, if any,&#13;
management information needed to run the operation efficiently. BJSC, similar to all&#13;
Mongolian companies, manually produces financial statements quarterly and presents&#13;
these to MEGM for checking and submission to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for the&#13;
tax assessment. The Finance and Economic Division of the company (FED) has operated&#13;
until recently merely as bookkeepers, with the planning and budgetary process limited to&#13;
a one-year period and rooted solidly in the requirements of the command economy.&#13;
There exists no integrated system encompassing all the accounting functions and the&#13;
related operating systems necessary to provide management with timely, complete and&#13;
accurate financial, cost and management information.&#13;
3.16  These deficiencies are being addressed by the introduction of International&#13;
Accounting Standards (IAS), and will be further addressed through intensive training&#13;
during the project (para. 4.13), increased utilization of information technology and the&#13;
introduction of an ongoing independent annual audit. Mongolia is in the process of&#13;
converting the accounting system of all state-owned enterprises to conform with IAS&#13;
which have become mandatory for all enterprises from the beginning of 1996. This&#13;
system of reporting will comprise a revised code of accounts; a prescribed method of&#13;
asset revaluation or indexation; the adoption of accounting principles which are&#13;
substantially in line with IAS; and an amendment to the income tax act allowing the&#13;
deduction for tax purposes of the revised depreciation provisions.&#13;
3.17  Auditing Arrangements. At present, a statutory annual audit is not required in&#13;
Mongolia, and the skills do not exist locally in sufficient numbers to support such a&#13;
requirement.  BJSC's internal audit is limited to a biannual stock take. which is&#13;
undertaken purely for accounting or reporting purposes. This shortcominlg is being&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
addressed at the national level by technical assistance being provided under the&#13;
Government's Management Development Program.&#13;
3.18  To overcome these deficiencies, BJSC will arrange, under the project, for&#13;
independent joint annual audits by auditors acceptable to IDA of its accounts and provide&#13;
audit opinions within six months of its financial year-end. Auditing skills in Mongolia&#13;
are limited to the Dalai firm of accountants which, although independent, does not yet&#13;
meet the rigorous auditing standards required. As a consequence, BJSC has agreed to&#13;
appoint a joint auditor of intemational standing acceptable to IDA. The auditors will be&#13;
required to express an opinion on the adequacy of the accounting system and intemal&#13;
controls and review Statements of Expenditures and compliance with financial covenants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.1   The main objective of the proposed project is to reverse the decline in Mongolia's&#13;
coal production by increasing sustainable production levels at the Baganuur mine to&#13;
4 Mtpy. Additional, associated objectives are for BJSC (a) to develop financial self-&#13;
sufficiency, (b) to increase equipment productivity and improve efficiency, (c) to operate&#13;
as an independent commercial company, and (d) for BJSC to operate in an&#13;
environmentally acceptable manner over the long term. These objectives would be&#13;
achieved through a combination of investment in mine rehabilitation, and implementation&#13;
of management restructuring and operational reform at BJSC. The project would provide&#13;
a model for management reform of key energy sector companies.&#13;
4.2   The main focus of the mine rehabilitation is the upgrading of the mine's&#13;
technology base. The inflexible and obsolete railway system to remove overburden,&#13;
which has constrained the entire overburden removal and coal production program in&#13;
recent years, will be removed and replaced by a fleet of 85-ton dump trucks. The&#13;
availability and utilization of existing excavators (shovels and draglines) will be&#13;
improved through provision of adequate stocks of spare parts to service the excavator&#13;
fleet, improved maintenance, and improved operational management. Existing fleets of&#13;
mine support equipment will be enlarged considerably in size and in power ratings to&#13;
ensure proper in-mine support of excavators. A new coal-handling plant will be&#13;
constructed to improve coal quality.&#13;
4.3   The efficiency of the Baganuur coal mine will also be increased through&#13;
development of BJSC into an independent shareholding company with a commercial&#13;
focus and accountability to its shareholders, reorganization of the company's institutional&#13;
structure, improved mine planning, mine operational management and supervision,&#13;
maintenance and materials management, manpower reduction, and improved systems for&#13;
financial reporting and cost control. The project's training and technical assistance&#13;
components will assist BJSC to improve efficiency in these areas, and to improve&#13;
environmental management.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.4   The principal features of the proposed project are:&#13;
(a)   procurement and commissioning of equipment to rehabilitate the&#13;
Baganuur coal mine operation consisting of twenty 85-ton dump trucks,&#13;
ten 40-ton coal trucks, 310, 320 and 550-horsepower (hp) bulldozers, a&#13;
275 hp grader, a 9-cubic meter (mi3) front-end loader, various support&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
vehicles (tire, fuel/ lube, welding, and water spray trucks, cranes and&#13;
lowboys), explosive initiation systems, mine dewatering equipment,&#13;
workshop equipment, tools and consumables, spare parts for existing mine&#13;
equipment, and coal quality laboratory and environmental equipment, as&#13;
well as construction of a short access road and other minor civil works;&#13;
(b)   procurement and turnkey installation and commissioning of equipment for&#13;
a coal-handling plant consisting of crusher, linear stacker, underground&#13;
reclaimer and train-loader;&#13;
(c)   technical assistance to BJSC including in-country and overseas training to&#13;
(i) improve mine operations and mine supervision practices and&#13;
procedures; (ii) develop mine maintenance management and materials&#13;
management systems; (iii) upgrade financial and cost accounting/&#13;
management information (MIS) systems; and (iv) improve environmental&#13;
management capabilities.  Technical assistance will be provided to&#13;
MEGM for coal-sector strategy development.&#13;
4.5   Project Performance Monitoring. The performance of the project in meeting its&#13;
stated objectives (para. 4.1) will be closely monitored by the Government, BJSC and IDA&#13;
throughout the life of the project. In addition to progress in the regular aspects of project&#13;
implementation, such as procurement and disbursement, project performance for each key&#13;
objective will be monitored with the use of specific indicators agreed with BJSC and&#13;
presented in Annex 4.1. The project's central objective-achievement and maintenance&#13;
of coal production of 4 Mtpy at the Baganuur mine-will be monitored against agreed&#13;
annual coal production, overburden removal and coal-handling plant throughput&#13;
indicators. BJSC's success in developing financial self-sufficiency will be monitored&#13;
against a series of criteria, based on BJSC's audited annual financial statements. Specific&#13;
annual equipment productivity criteria, central to improving efficiency at BJSC, also have&#13;
been defined and agreed. Further progress in BJSC's restructuring program, and issues&#13;
relating to separation of government ownership and regulation of the company will be&#13;
regularly evaluated.   Specific criteria for assessing progress in improving the&#13;
environmental sustainability of BJSC's operation also will be regularly monitored. A&#13;
mid-term project review will be conducted in the first semester of 1998, focusing on coal&#13;
sector regulation and policy issues, as well as project implementation issues.&#13;
4.6   Location and Infrastructure. The Baganuur mine is located 125 miles east of&#13;
the capital city of Ulaanbaatar (Map IBRD 27478). The terrain surrounding the mine is&#13;
rolling countryside at an elevation of 1,250 to 1,330 meters above sea level. Apart from&#13;
short sections of hard-top road outside of Ulaanbaatar and the small town of Baganuur,&#13;
the intervening distance currently can be traversed by vehicle only over unprepared paths&#13;
across the countryside. The mine area is connected to Ulaanbaatar by rail loop and the&#13;
main rail line connecting Ulaanbaatar to the border with China, providing a route for coal&#13;
deliveries to CES and other major consumers. The climate is continental and severe, with&#13;
winter temperatures reaching minus 35 degrees centigrade. Rainfall is moderate with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
periodic heavy showers. The mine is presently serviced with power, water supply and an&#13;
access road, and these facilities are all adequate for the coming 20-year mine&#13;
development period. The present mine townsite is large and more than adequately sized&#13;
for the present work force.&#13;
4.7   Geology, Reserves and Coal Quality.  Baganuur coal area is synclinal in&#13;
structure, with its main axis north-south stretching approximately 8 kilometers and its&#13;
minor axis east-west being approximately 4 kilometers wide. Coal seams dip toward the&#13;
central synclinal axis with seam gradients ranging up to 25 degrees. There are three main&#13;
seams of coal: Seam 3, 2.0 to 38.4 meters thickness overlying Seam 2A, 2.0 to 24.8&#13;
meters thickness, overlying Seam 2, 6.0 to 77.0 meters thickness. The interval between&#13;
the individual coal seams varies across the syncline but is typically of the order of 70&#13;
meters, consisting of sandy rock strata with permafrost near-surface rock conditions. The&#13;
coal seams are typically thin and of no commercial interest over the western section of&#13;
the syncline and typically 13 to 23 meters thickness (seams 2, 2A and 3) in the eastern&#13;
section, the location of present mining operations and those projected over the 20-year&#13;
mine rehabilitation project life.&#13;
4.8   Proven and economically recoverable reserves (thickness in excess of 3.0 meters,&#13;
heating value greater than 3,300 kcal/kg, and overburden:coal stripping ratio less than 5:1&#13;
bank cubic meters/coal) are 295 million tons coal, sufficient for a mine life in excess of&#13;
50 years. There are no major faults traversing the area, but minor faults are mapped and&#13;
are exposed in present mine areas. Coal quality is lignitic with "as received" heating&#13;
values typically in the 3,200 to 3,500 kcal/kg range, total moisture ranging from 25 to&#13;
33 percent and ash content, 10 to 12 percent. In the present mining area, the coal seams&#13;
contain thin dirt partings that cannot be separated efficiently by selective mining and are&#13;
extracted as part of the coal product.&#13;
4.9   Mine Rehabilitation Plan. The mine layout for the coming 20 years is well&#13;
conceived and provides for a consistent coal quality product by combining areas of low&#13;
and higher stripping ratio, thus avoiding short-term "high grading" of the coal areas and&#13;
preserving future mine development areas of similar economic merit (see Anneax4.2).&#13;
The mine development plan foresees continued, down-dip extraction of Seam 2 and 2A in&#13;
the Main Pit area (Mountain Section 1) and of Seam 2 at Mountain Section 2 (Main Pit).&#13;
The existing Mountain Section 3 and the extraction of Seam 3 will be captured by the&#13;
Mountain Section 2 operations starting 1999. Down-dip extraction of Seam 2 will&#13;
continue in Mountain Section 5. Mountain Sections 4 (Seam 2A) and 5 (Extension Seam&#13;
2) will be developed in later years in order to maintain a balanced stripping ratio and&#13;
uniform coal quality product. In-pit dumping will be maximized by construction of&#13;
cross-pit roads to minimize costs of hauling overburden out of the pit areas.&#13;
4.10  The mine rehabilitation program includes the following investments in improved&#13;
technology and mining equipment:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
(a)   introduction of 85-ton haul trucks on upper overburden benches to replace&#13;
the existing inefficient rail transport system (end- 1996) and the replacement&#13;
of aging small capacity coal trucks with 40-ton coal trucks in 1998;&#13;
(b)   introduction of a fleet of 310, 320 and 550-hp bulldozers during the 1996-98&#13;
period to effectively handle overburden spoil dumps, assist dragline&#13;
operation on top of the coal seams, and to provide cleanup support to all&#13;
shovel operations on both overburden and coal benches; and&#13;
(c)   introduction of an additional grader, rubber-tired dozer and front-end loader&#13;
to ensure efficient haul road construction and maintenance and to improve&#13;
general in-pit housekeeping. The existing fleet of water tankers will be&#13;
increased to five units to ensure adequate dust suppression on haul roads and&#13;
an acceptable health environment. Miscellaneous mine vehicles (tire and&#13;
fuel/lube trucks, lowboys and cranes) will be introduced to ensure high&#13;
levels of equipment productivity through full support and servicing of&#13;
mining equipment fleets.&#13;
4.11  Additional investments include:&#13;
(a)   a major upgrading in maintenance workshop and warehouse facilities&#13;
(complemented with training and technical assistance-see para. 4.13), with&#13;
provision of modem workshop equipment and tools, and procurement of an&#13;
adequate stock of spare parts for existing Russian, Japanese, and American&#13;
equipment fleets (AnnexA a);&#13;
(b)   completion of the mine dewatering and monitoring well development&#13;
program, previously discontinued due to lack of funds;&#13;
(c)   importation of urgently needed explosive initiation system consumables&#13;
(caps, boosters and delay mechanisms) to ensure effective overburden&#13;
fragmentation, particularly blasting of permafrost areas; and&#13;
(d)   construction of a coal handling plant, on a turnkey basis to ensure a reliable&#13;
4.0 Mtpy supply of quality coal to customers. All coal will be sized at&#13;
50 mm or less to overcome historical coal handling problems by customers&#13;
(previous coal deliveries have been sized at 300 mm or less, with portions of&#13;
supply even in excess of that size).&#13;
4.12  Investments in civil works include (a) construction of a 5 km access road to haul&#13;
coal from the existing Mountain Section 5 to the new coal handling plant,&#13;
(b) modification and modernization of workshop facilities to accommodate the new&#13;
equipment fleets, particularly the 85-ton dump trucks, (c) a short rail line addition, and&#13;
(d) certain modifications to the existing coal handling facilities and heat plant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
4.13  Training and Technical Assistance. Training and technical assistance is a key&#13;
aspect of the project. Components focus on in-country training of Mongolian staff,&#13;
combined with on-site technical assistance, but overseas training and study tours to&#13;
expose Mongolian staff to international practices are also included. Components include&#13;
support for BJSC's ambitious programs to improve mine efficiency, for establishing an&#13;
environmental management function in BJSC, and for further development of the&#13;
Government's coal subsector development strategy:&#13;
(a)   Mine Operations, Supervision and Maintenance ($1 million). This&#13;
component will provide support to improve equipment and labor&#13;
productivity, equipment maintenance and availability, application of key&#13;
equipment to top priority tasks, and proper allocation of support or&#13;
ancillary equipment. The component includes training and technical&#13;
assistance to (i) improve the capacity of BJSC's corporate management to&#13;
operate in a commercial, market setting, and familiarize both executives&#13;
and middle-level managers with international mine operation and&#13;
personnel management practices; (ii) improve mine planning; (iii) adjust&#13;
mine operational procedures and practices to comply with the&#13;
technological shift and modern practices, clearly define the responsibilities&#13;
of supervisory personnel, adjust compensation schedules accordingly, and&#13;
build necessary new equipment operator skills; (iv) further develop and&#13;
implement a new system of mine maintenance and materials management;&#13;
and (v) improve mine cost engineering (see Annex 4.4).&#13;
(b)   Environmental Management ($250,000).  Training and technical&#13;
assistance will be provided for the establishment of an Environmental&#13;
Management Unit at the mine, which will implement BJSC's&#13;
environmental management program (paras. 4.28-4.32). Training for the&#13;
unit's staff will focus on: (i) environmental management, monitoring and&#13;
reclamation; (ii) spoils dump construction and stability, spoil management&#13;
and drainage; (iii) hydrogeology (groundwater and surface water modeling&#13;
and management); (iv) occupational health and safety in the mining&#13;
industry (see Annex.4.5).&#13;
(c)   Cost and Financial Accounting Systems ($750,000). The objective of&#13;
this component is to develop BJSC's accounting and financial reporting&#13;
systems to better conform with international norms and the new&#13;
requirements of the Government, and to provide BJSC management with&#13;
the information needed to improve cost control. Training and technical&#13;
assistance will include design, development and implementation of a new&#13;
management information system to meet BJSC's accounting and cost&#13;
control needs (Annx4.6).&#13;
(d)   Coal Sector Strategy ($1.1 million). Technical assistance would be&#13;
provided to MEGM for evaluation of the technical and economic prospects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
of the Shive Ovoo and Tavan Tolgoi mines (paras. 2.2-2.5), and to assist&#13;
MEGM to define its future regulatory and policy role in the subsector. At&#13;
Shive Ovoo, additional technical investigations and analysis are necessary&#13;
to formulate a mine development plan that can provide coal of acceptable&#13;
and reliable quality at affordable cost. Special emphasis will be placed on&#13;
evaluation of the huge steam/coking coal deposit at Tavan Tolgoi in the&#13;
Gobi Desert, including further evaluation of the resource, analysis of the&#13;
feasibility work completed by Russian experts, and assessment of possible&#13;
development options and their costs and economic viability. Regulatory&#13;
and institutional reform aspects should consider corporatization and&#13;
privatization strategies for the various mines, and clear definition of&#13;
MEGM's regulatory and policy role in the emerging market economy&#13;
(Annex 4.).  At negotiations, assurances were obtained from  the&#13;
Government that it will carry out the coal sector strategy technical&#13;
assistance in accordance with Terms of Reference and an implementation&#13;
schedule acceptable to the Association, and prepare and provide to IDA&#13;
annual progress reports on the implementation of the technical assistance.&#13;
C. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
4.14  The estimated cost of the proposed project at Baganuur is $59.3 million (Tg 28.8&#13;
billion), including import duties and sales taxes, and physical and price contingencies, but&#13;
excluding incremental working capital and interest during construction (IDC). All cost&#13;
and financing estimates, including local costs (as well as projections of BJSC's financial&#13;
projections), have been calculated in US dollars, due to high and unpredictable domestic&#13;
inflation. Physical contingencies are calculated at 5 percent for local and foreign costs,&#13;
except the coal-handling plant foreign cost component, for which a 10 percent&#13;
contingency is calculated, as engineering details are still preliminary. Price escalation is&#13;
based on the phasing of commitments and projected international inflation rates of&#13;
2.4 percent per year for 1996 and thereafter. Incorporating the coal sector technical&#13;
assistance to MEGM, the total project cost is $60.4 million (Tg 29.3 billion) (Table 4.1).&#13;
4.15  Cost estimates are based on international experience in procuring similar mining&#13;
and coal-handling equipment worldwide. Civil works/infrastructure costs are formulated&#13;
by BJSC based on local conditions and experience. Training and technical assistance cost&#13;
estimates are based on experience in similar projects in Mongolia and other countries.&#13;
4.16  The total capital cost for the mine rehabilitation project, including physical&#13;
contingencies but excluding price escalation and import duties/sales taxes, is less than&#13;
$35 per ton annual incremental output, which is in line with the costs of coal mine/&#13;
handling plant rehabilitation in other developing economies. The incremental cost of&#13;
expansion beyond the scope currently envisaged in this project, to an output level of say&#13;
5.0 Mtpy of coal, would be less-perhaps only $10 to $15 per annual incremental ton,&#13;
placing the Baganuur coal mine on a firm economic footing for possible further&#13;
expansion.&#13;

D. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
4.17 The financing plan for the project is shown Table 4.2. Total financing required,&#13;
including interest during construction and incremental working capital requirements, is&#13;
$61.9 million of which $51.3 million, or 82.9 percent, constitutes the direct foreign&#13;
exchange component. The proposed IDA credit of $35.0 million represents 68 percent of&#13;
the foreign exchange component and 57 percent of the total project cost. IDA funds&#13;
would be made available to the Government of Mongolia at standard IDA terms, with 40&#13;
years' maturity and a 10-year grace period. The IDA credit would finance mining and&#13;
mine support equipment (except for coal trucks and 550-hp bulldozers), ancillary mine&#13;
equipment and vehicles, mining materials, workshop tools and equipment, spare parts&#13;
contracts, a part of the mine dewatering contract and all technical assistance and training&#13;
components. IDA fimds would be onlent by the Government to BJSC under a subsidiary&#13;
loan agreement between the Government and BJSC. At negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtainedfrom the Borrower that it would onlend IDA funds to BJSC under a subsidiary&#13;
loan agreement with terms during BJSC's transition to a commercial company as&#13;
follows: (a) BJSC would bear the foreign exchange risk; (b) the interest rate would be&#13;
4.2 percent per year; (c) the grace period would be 8 years; and (d) the repayment period&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
would be 25 years. Execution of the subsidiary loan agreement will be a condition of&#13;
credit effectiveness.&#13;

4.18   BJSC  and the Government have requested the assistance of the Overseas&#13;
Economic Cooperation Fund, Japan (OECF), to provide parallel cofinancing for key&#13;
items for which the available IDA and domestic funds are insufficient. These items&#13;
include foreign exchange expenditures for the coal-handling plant, ten 40-ton coal trucks&#13;
and six large (e.g., 550-hp) bulldozers required for the Baganuur mine rehabilitation.&#13;
Based on current estimates, including physical and price contingencies, this would&#13;
require financing of $15.5 million equivalent. The local financing requirement is&#13;
estimated at $11.4 million equivalent, comprised of all civil works ($1.6 million), part of&#13;
the dewatering program ($650,000), local costs for constructing the coal-handling plant&#13;
($2.2 million), all import duties and sales taxes ($5.4 million), and incremental working&#13;
capital and IDC ($1.5 million) The local contribution would be financed by BJSC&#13;
through its internal cash flow or, if necessary, with funds borrowed from the Government.&#13;
Projections of BJSC's financial position during 1996-2000 show that the company should&#13;
have the cash to provide this financing (paras. 5.13-5.15).&#13;
4.19   It is understood that the Government is likely to require financing for the coal-&#13;
handling plant, coal trucks and large bulldozers from OECF or another financing source.&#13;
OECF indicated its intent to provide parallel cofinancing for the proposed project at the&#13;
international donors' meeting on Mongolia in February 1996.&#13;
E. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.20 Under previous IDA operations in Mongolia, procurement has been centralized&#13;
within the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and considerable experience and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
expertise has been developed in assisting various project entities (including BJSC) to&#13;
process procurement of goods and services under IDA guidelines. Within MTI, a&#13;
procurement cell has been established, earlier assisted by an IDA-financed project&#13;
implementation and procurement advisor. This cell has been and continues to be the&#13;
focal point for IDA-financed procurement. A country procurement assessment review&#13;
has not been considered necessary to date, given the small size of the portfolio and&#13;
smooth experience with procurement work so far. BJSC has agreed that MTI will assist&#13;
with the expeditious processing of all project-related equipment and services. With&#13;
project preparation funds and IDA Technical Assistance Credit (TAC) proceeds, a&#13;
procurement advisor is being retained to assist MTI/BJSC to prepare international&#13;
competitive bidding (ICB) and other bidding documents, using IDA's Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents, and to assist in bid evaluation and the submission of bid evaluation reports,&#13;
prior to credit effectiveness.  Procurement for all IDA-financed elements will be&#13;
conducted in accordance with the "Bank's Guidelines for Procurement and IBRD Loans&#13;
and IDA Credits, January 1995" and revised in January 1996.&#13;
4.21  IDA proceeds will be used to procure the majority of goods to be imported, with&#13;
the exception of goods in two packages (coal-handling plant and bulldozers) scheduled&#13;
for parallel cofinancing. Packages that are clearly suitable for IDA financing (Annex4.)&#13;
have been agreed with BJSC.&#13;
4.22  Contracts for two offshore packages ($26.4 million)-mining equipment and&#13;
explosives-would be awarded following ICB procedures and will be subject to&#13;
postqualification.  In bid evaluation, Mongolian manufacturers will be allowed a&#13;
preferential margin of 15 percent of the CIF costs of competing imports, or the relevant&#13;
prevailing level of customs duties that BJSC would have to pay. The mine dewatering&#13;
contract ($1.3 million, including contingencies and taxes, of which 50 percent will be&#13;
financed by IDA and 50 percent by BJSC) will be negotiated by BJSC on a sole-source&#13;
basis with Burvodstroi, a Russian government water well construction company that&#13;
installed the original dewatering well network and that is currently installing other mine&#13;
dewatering facilities at Baganuur. Spare parts contracts with a total value of $6.3 million,&#13;
including contingencies and taxes, will be procured directly from relevant Russian,&#13;
Japanese and US companies, on a sole-source basis. Equipment items or packages of&#13;
estimated value of less than $250,000 would be procured by international shopping, up to&#13;
an aggregate value of $2.2 million, with at least three quotations from at least two&#13;
countries. Previous experience in mining projects financed by the Bank Group has shown&#13;
that international shopping for these small equipment packages (various trucks, lowboys,&#13;
cranes, laboratory equipment, hand tools, etc.) is the only procurement method that&#13;
provides quick and reasonable responses and quotations, due to the low value of the&#13;
items. All ICB packages, all procurement planned on a sole-source basis and contracts&#13;
awarded through international shopping procedures with a value of $150,000 or more will&#13;
be subject to prior review by IDA. This constitutes over 95 percent of all goods to be&#13;
financed from the proposed credit, the balance being subject to postreview by IDA. All&#13;
IDA-financed training and technical assistance services ($3.3 million, averaging $0.8&#13;
million per contract) will be procured in accordance with IDA guidelines for the use of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
consultants. For complex, time-based assignments, consultant services contracts will be&#13;
based on the Bank's Standard Form of Contract for Consultants' Services. Prior IDA&#13;
review will be required for all consultant services contracts with an estimated cost&#13;
exceeding $50,000 for individuals or $100,000 for firms. All terms of reference and&#13;
single-source selections, however, will be subject to IDA's prior review, regardless of&#13;
contract value. Details of procurement of goods and services are shown in Table 4.3 and&#13;
Annex 4.8.&#13;

F. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.23  Disbursements will be made against (a) 100 percent of the foreign cost of directly&#13;
imported goods, and 75 percent of local expenditures, and (b) 100percent of the&#13;
consultancy cost of technical assistance. Disbursements would be made on the basis of&#13;
statements of expenditures (SOEs) for actual expenditures against: (a) contracts of less&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
than $150,000 for goods, (b) consultants' contracts of less than $100,000 equivalent for&#13;
firms and $50,000 equivalent for individuals, and (c) training costs. Disbursements for&#13;
all other expenditures would be supported by full documentation.  Supporting&#13;
documentation for all disbursements against SOEs would be retained by BJSC and made&#13;
available upon request for examination by IDA review missions. To facilitate timely&#13;
project implementation and disbursements, the Government would establish and operate,&#13;
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association, a Special Account with an&#13;
authorized allocation of $1.0 million.&#13;
4.24  The expected project completion date is June 30, 2001 and the loan closing date&#13;
shall be December 31, 2001. A disbursement schedule is presented as Annex 4.9.&#13;
G. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
4.25  Project Organization.  Project preparation has been completed with the&#13;
finalization of the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) by BJSC management. The PIP is&#13;
available in the project file. BJSC management are familiarizing themselves with IDA&#13;
procurement procedures through interfacing with the staff of MTI and with the assistance&#13;
of an international procurement advisor. BJSC's new organization structure (para. 3.11)&#13;
streamlines the previous structure, facilitates efficient mine operations, and strengthens&#13;
maintenance, financial and environmental management functions. With the exception of&#13;
the coal sector strategy technical assistance, the details of project implementation will be&#13;
managed directly by BJSC's core company management team, which also supervised all&#13;
aspects of project preparation. The coal sector strategy technical assistance will be&#13;
implemented by MEGM (para. 4.13).&#13;
4.26  Project Status. The project has been approved by the Ministry of Finance and is&#13;
an integral part of the Government's short-term economic development plan. The PIP&#13;
prepared by BJSC, with assistance from Mongolian and international experts, has been&#13;
reviewed by IDA and found acceptable. The Environmental Analysis Report (paras.&#13;
4.28-4.32) has been reviewed by IDA and found acceptable. A General Procurement&#13;
Notice was published in March 1995. ICB documents are now under preparation and are&#13;
tentatively scheduled to be issued in May 1996. It is anticipated that ICB and most&#13;
international shopping will be completed and bid evaluation reports submitted for IDA&#13;
review before credit effectiveness, thus facilitating expeditious equipment deliveries.&#13;
Arrangements for parallel cofinancing are proceeding smoothly.&#13;
4.27 Implementation Schedule. Board presentation is scheduled for May 1996.&#13;
Credit effectiveness is anticipated in July 1996. A tentative project implementation&#13;
schedule is provided in Annex 4.10. It is anticipated that bid evaluation reports for all&#13;
major imported equipment items will be completed at or about the loan effectiveness date&#13;
such that the majority of contracts can be negotiated and signed in July 1996, with&#13;
equipment deliveries over the ensuing 3- to 6-month period. It is anticipated that&#13;
cofinancing arrangements can be finalized by October 1996, so that procurement of the&#13;
coal-handling plant and bulldozers can proceed according to the project implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
schedule. No land needs to be acquired by BJSC and all necessary infrastructure is in&#13;
place. Ongoing mine development over the coming 20-year project period will not&#13;
involve the resettlement of any people. Physical project completion is expected in late-&#13;
1998/early 1999.&#13;
H. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
4.28  In accordance with OD 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), the proposed project is&#13;
designated as Category B. With international and local technical assistance, BJSC&#13;
completed an Environmental Analysis Report (EAR) in June 1995, including an&#13;
Environmental Management Program (EMP) to be implemented under the project (Anne&#13;
4.1). The EAR was approved by the Ministry of Environment in August 1995. The&#13;
draft report was reviewed by IDA and found to be acceptable, provided revisions were&#13;
undertaken to incorporate data collected during the summer months. These modifications&#13;
were undertaken in October 1995, and the final EAR was issued in November 1995.&#13;
4.29  One issue identified at the outset of project preparation was the potential impact&#13;
of ongoing open-pit coal mining operations on the adjacent Baganuur Lake. The level of&#13;
the lake, located adjacent to the northwest of the mine area (Map IBRD 27479) and of&#13;
religious and historic significance to the local population, had shown signs of being&#13;
lowered. During project preparation, Mongolian and international environmental and&#13;
hydrogeological experts developed data that indicated that the lake stability was not&#13;
dependent upon groundwater replenishment and thus, the possibility of the lake being&#13;
impacted by mining and related mine dewatering was highly unlikely. Previous&#13;
fluctuations in the lake water level are attributed to seasonal flow changes in the streams&#13;
flowing into the lake. The experts have recommended a further, ongoing groundwater&#13;
monitoring program to determine any impacts on the lake stability. In the unlikely event&#13;
that some impact on the lake related to ongoing mining operations were to occur, BJSC is&#13;
committed in the agreed EMP to dedicate resources to correct the problem: studies have&#13;
indicated that water from mine dewatering and/or local rivers can de diverted into the&#13;
lake area. Public consultation with representatives of the local and regional population,&#13;
initiated during project preparation, will be continued through project implementation.&#13;
4.30 A second issue identified was that BJSC had traditionally conducted its mining&#13;
operations without reclamation and treatment of overburden spoil dumps. With the&#13;
assistance of Mongolian and international experts, the EAR and agreed EMP include a&#13;
full plan to effectively manage the reclamation of spoil dumps, including a plan to&#13;
progressively recover old spoil dump areas. Under the project, heavy earth-moving&#13;
equipment will be procured to recover topsoil and recontour all dump areas. The phased&#13;
reclamation plan will be monitored throughout project implementation.&#13;
4.31  A review of general ecological issues was undertaken and no problems identified.&#13;
Other environmental issues addressed in the EAR and for which mitigation plans are&#13;
included in the EMP include (a) mitigation of dust within the mine area; (b) health and&#13;
safety; (c) hazardous waste disposal; and (d) monitoring of environmental contamination.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Environmental performance monitoring criteria have been developed within the EMP and&#13;
will be monitored throughout project implementation. The EMP includes the collection&#13;
of further environmental baseline data and investigation of the hydrology as identified in&#13;
the EAR; maintenance of a register of emissions, discharges and wastes; definition of&#13;
environmental standards and quality objectives; definition of environmental control&#13;
systems; and implementation of the detailed environmental monitoring program. At&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained from BJSC that it will carry out the&#13;
Environmental Management Program (EMP) in a manner satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
4.32 BJSC is establishing a small Environmental Management Unit (EMU), which will&#13;
be responsible for coordinating the implementation of the EMP within BJSC, the&#13;
environmental monitoring work, and oversight of the reclamation activities (Annex 4.1 1).&#13;
Training and technical assistance support for the EMU will be provided under the project&#13;
(para. 4.13, Annex4..5).&#13;
I. SOCIAL IMPACTS OF MANPOWER REDUCTION&#13;
4.33  Recognizing that the Baganuur region provides limited employment opportunities&#13;
and that unemployment rates in the region generally are quite high, the social impact of&#13;
the planned manpower reduction (para. 3.12) has been assessed in detail (Anne4.2).&#13;
Analysis has indicated that a major proportion of the excess manpower (about 600&#13;
positions) can be reduced through natural attrition including retirements, voluntary&#13;
separation, etc. With some adjustments to the manpower reduction program to avoid&#13;
bunching of dismissals that could potentially cause hardship, the number of personnel&#13;
that will need to be dismissed involuntarily is estimated at about 150 persons over five&#13;
years, and is manageable. BJSC will work closely with local government officials and&#13;
representatives of the trade union to avoid bunching of the dismissals, and to ensure that&#13;
they are undertaken in a socially responsible manner. Review of the family and skills&#13;
background of affected staff with local government/trade union representatives also will&#13;
help avoid severe hardship. There will be no discrimination against women. There are a&#13;
number of international donor initiatives providing support for vulnerable groups,&#13;
development of small and medium enterprises, new community initiatives, and&#13;
infrastructure development. BJSC will assist, where required, local and international&#13;
agencies in the design and implementation arrangements for social support and small&#13;
business development at Baganuur. Where appropriate, BJSC also will use its inhouse&#13;
training facilities to better prepare affected workers for work opportunities outside the&#13;
direct mining community.&#13;
4.34 BJSC provided assurances at negotiations that it would implement any manpower&#13;
reduction program according to principles satisfactory to IDA. Said principles were&#13;
agreed at negotiations (AnnexA412).&#13;
J. REPORTING&#13;
4.35 BJSC will furmish IDA with annual financial reports and semiannual project&#13;
implementation progress reports. Annual financial reports will include project accounts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
and annual financial statements in accordance with IAS, together with an independent&#13;
audit report. They should also include a rolling five-year financial plan, developed and&#13;
presented as part of BJSC's corporate development strategy (para. 5.22). Semiannual&#13;
project progress reports will include unaudited financial reports, and will state progress&#13;
on all agreed technical, enviromnental and financial performance monitoring criteria, and&#13;
the status of all project components. These reports should outline compliance with coal&#13;
supply contracts with key consumers, including coal quality requirements. The detailed&#13;
scope and content of the project progress reports will be agreed during project&#13;
negotiations. In addition, MEGM will provide IDA with annual progress reports on the&#13;
implementation of the coal sector strategy technical assistance. At negotiations, IDA&#13;
obtained assurances from the Government that it will submit a mid-project review report,&#13;
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Association, to IDA by April 1, 1998, review&#13;
this report with the Association by June 1, 1998, and ensure efficient completion of the&#13;
project based on the recommendations of this report and the Association's views on the&#13;
matter. IDA also obtained assurances from BJSC that it will provide biannual project&#13;
progress reports to IDA, integrating the results of agreed monitoring and evaluation&#13;
activities, and that it will ensure efficient completion of the project based on the&#13;
recommendations of these reports and the Association 's views on the matter.&#13;

5. FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
5.1   Until March 1995, BJSC was operated and funded essentially as a branch of the&#13;
Government, under the direction of MEGM. Along with the rest of the country, the&#13;
company is making the transition from a centrally-planned, production-oriented and state-&#13;
owned enterprise to a commercial, profit-driven joint stock company. Restoring BJSC's&#13;
productive capacity and establishing it as a competitive and financially viable mining&#13;
company, independent of state budgetary support, is a central objective of this project.&#13;
BJSC will be one of the first large companies in Mongolia to make this transition, and the&#13;
first in the energy sector.&#13;
5.2   BJSC was structured to conform from its inception to the demands of the&#13;
command economy. Its accounting function was geared primarily to safeguarding the&#13;
company's assets and reporting on the achievement of predefined production targets.&#13;
Operational efficiencies, cost control and working capital management were of secondary&#13;
importance. The price of coal was regulated by government and set at a level which:&#13;
(a) covered operating costs (including a nominal provision for depreciation); and&#13;
(b) provided sufficient profits for tax payments and appropriations for the Social and&#13;
Economic Development Fund and other social activities.  Capital equipment was&#13;
acquired by MEGM and transferred to the company as it was needed. This system,&#13;
although adequate in the past, has become increasingly inappropriate with the high levels&#13;
of inflation experienced since 1990 and the rapid move toward a market economy, trade&#13;
liberalization, economic reform and corporate autonomy.&#13;
5.3   Despite an increase in the nominal coal price in 1993, BJSC ran into severe&#13;
financial difficulties resulting primarily from:  (a) insufficient investment, obsolete&#13;
technology, poor operational efficiencies and declining production; (b) decapitalization&#13;
resulting from hyperinflation and inadequate depreciation provisions; (c) excessive delay&#13;
in payments for coal deliveries to major state owned CHP plants; and (d) a real decline in&#13;
the price of coal denominated in foreign currency.&#13;
5.4  In 1994 the Government introduced far-reaching legislation that will result in the&#13;
progressive privatization of BJSC, the adoption of international accounting standards&#13;
(IAS) and the revision of depreciation provisions for tax purposes. An agreement was&#13;
reached in mid-1995 between BJSC, CHP plants 3 and 4, and Mongol Railways for both&#13;
prompt settlement of payment for new coal deliveries and gradual settlement of&#13;
outstanding accounts receivable. A more appropriate coal pricing mechanism is being&#13;
formulated and implemented in 1996. Concurrently with these reforms BJSC, in order to&#13;
become competitive and financially viable in the market economy, plans to significantly&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

improve and automate its financial management. The project provides for this through&#13;
both a major training and technical assistance (TA) component on financial management&#13;
(para. 4.13), and agreements with BJSC on financial performance targets and&#13;
implementation of a formal independent annual audit to ensure financial discipline and&#13;
control.&#13;
B. PAST AND PRESENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
5.5   Financial Overview.  As with other economies in transition, Mongolia has&#13;
experienced significant hyperinflation in recent years. The price index4 rose from 100 in&#13;
1990 to 1839 in 1993, an annual increase of 164 percent. The domestic currency in turn&#13;
was devalued from 40 to 412 tugrik to the US dollar over the period 1992 to 1994.&#13;
Historic accounting data are grossly distorted as a result. Comparisons between past&#13;
years are therefore of little value and the time and cost of restating the company's&#13;
accounts to eliminate these distortions prior to 1994 is not justified. Nonetheless, some&#13;
idea of BJSC's deteriorating financial position during 1992-94 can be gained if it is&#13;
assumed that BJSC's cost of sales remained constant in US dollar terms during the&#13;
period. In this event BJSC's pretax income declined from $2.6 million in 1992 to a loss&#13;
of $0.13 million in 1993 and a small profit of $0.01 million in 1994. A tax assessment of&#13;
roughly $2.0 million was made in each of these years. This weak financial position is&#13;
likely to be somewhat accentuated by the understatement of costs inherent in these&#13;
figures due to excessive inflation.&#13;
5.6   The key conceptual differences between the traditional Mongolian accounting&#13;
principles and those of IAS are (a) capital equipment, inventories and other nonmonetary&#13;
assets are not adjusted to take into account high inflation; (b) no provision is made for&#13;
bad or doubtful debts or for excess and obsolete inventories; (c) many costs associated&#13;
with the Social and Economic Fund are regarded as an appropriation of profit and not&#13;
charged to operating expenditure or allowed as a deduction and (d) depreciation of fixed&#13;
assets, although allowable for tax purposes, is predefined by government and based on&#13;
historic costs and arbitrary rates of depreciation. These factors have all contributed to an&#13;
inadequate recovery of capital, understatement of operating costs, and an overstatement&#13;
of taxable profits, and have distorted the financial position and operating results of the&#13;
company.&#13;
5.7   Operating Performance. BJSC is dependent upon coal sales to, and payment by,&#13;
the two state-owned CHP plants in Ulaanbaatar, which comprise 84 percent of its annual&#13;
sales. The Nuurs Company purchases wholesale and undertakes retail coal sales. The&#13;
remaining 71 customers are close to BJSC, and purchase coal directly from the mine on a&#13;
cash basis. Shipments of coal in 1994 were 2.76 million tons, down from 2.87 million&#13;
tons the previous year. The average coal price of $6.29 per ton was barely sufficient to&#13;

cover unit operating costs revised to conform with IAS. This price declined further in US&#13;
dollar terms to a level of $5.6 per ton in 1995.&#13;
5.8   BJSC's financial results for 1994 were adjusted and restated5 substantially in line&#13;
with IAS. The company's revised 1994 revenue and cost structure is illustrated in Table&#13;
5.1. BJSC's adjusted unit operating costs amounted to $6.16/ton, which is low by&#13;
international standards.  Stores, labor, diesel, power and depreciation amount to&#13;
70 percent of operating cost. Manpower levels are excessive given the scope of the&#13;
operation. A labor reduction program is planned, although the potential for savings is&#13;
low due to the relatively low remuneration rates. Using IAS, depreciation rose to&#13;
31 percent of costs, as opposed to 8 percent under the previous accounting system.&#13;

quite differently using IAS. After adjustment to the previous financial reports, the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43 -&#13;
(a)    a substantial increase in the depreciation provision as a result of the&#13;
revaluation of fixed assets;&#13;
(b)   a significant understatement of operating costs owing to the valuation and&#13;
requisitioning of stores and supplies at historic values;&#13;
(c)   the devaluation of the tugrik which has a major impact on BJSC since&#13;
around 85 percent of its operating and capital costs are directly or&#13;
indirectly imported and are in foreign exchange. It is clear that after&#13;
adjusting for these distortions the coal price, in current terms, is&#13;
insufficient to cover direct operating costs and finance an appropriate&#13;
capital expenditure program without significant government support; and&#13;
(d)    a provision for income tax which was assessed on the basis of BJSC's&#13;
unadjusted results for the year. The income statement shows that despite&#13;
just breaking even, BJSC paid income taxes in 1994 amounting to $2.1&#13;
million. The net result is that BJSC made an after-tax loss of $2.1 million,&#13;
which effectively represents a reduction in BJSC's capital (net asset) base.&#13;
This was only maintained by the Government's contributing $2.8 million&#13;
in new capital equipment during the year with financing by a grant from&#13;
donors. This process of decapitalization continued in 1995.&#13;
5.10  From  the beginning of 1996 BJSC  is, together with all other Mongolian&#13;
enterprises, required by the Government to revalue its assets and convert to IAS. The&#13;
resulting higher depreciation rates will, under existing legislation, be allowed for tax&#13;
purposes, although this will be phased in over several years. These measures should,&#13;
after a settling-in period and suitable staff training, eliminate these inflationary distortions&#13;
and alleviate the financial drain experienced by BJSC.&#13;
5.11   Financial Position. The revised balance sheet outlined in Table 5.2 shows that&#13;
accounts receivables, inventory levels and fixed assets (after revaluation) comprise the&#13;
major assets of the BJSC. Difficulties with each of these asset categories have been&#13;
experienced by BJSC:&#13;
(a)    Sales receipts, amounting to around 200 days at end of 1994, have not&#13;
been collected by BJSC. Despite signed supply contracts, the CHPs were&#13;
forced to default on their obligations and have paid for about one-half of&#13;
their recent coal receipts. This has a large adverse impact on the cash flow&#13;
of BJSC. Recognizing this, the Government, in mid-1995, reduced the&#13;
payment arrears to the 1994 level and has undertaken to ensure that all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
commercial contractual arrangements are strictly enforced and all future&#13;
deliveries are settled promptly;6&#13;
(b)   The significant level of spare parts inventory amounting to an inventory&#13;
turnover of about 420 days.  Some 40 percent of these stores were&#13;
acquired prior to 1991 and are either surplus, slow-moving or obsolete.&#13;
The lack of adequate stock and usage data and cash flow have led to a&#13;
shortage of essential inventory and increased the potential for obsolete&#13;
inventory. BJSC is addressing this problem, and further assistance is&#13;
proposed under this project (para. 4.13); and&#13;
(c)    Fixed assets are old and largely obsolete, and will need to be replaced.&#13;
Under the project about two-thirds of the existing asset base will be retired&#13;
and written off over the next five years. This will impact significantly&#13;
short- to medium-term profits and tax payments.&#13;
5.12   Although the current ratio of 2.3 is quite satisfactory, it is clear that both the level&#13;
of current assets and current liabilities are far in excess of what they should be, and result&#13;
from: (a) the excessive stores and consumables inventory levels; (b) the slow collection&#13;
of receivables; and therefore (c) the slow settlement of trade creditors. BJSC has been&#13;
drained of liquidity and the maximum balance of cash on hand of $0.2 million (Tg 84.2&#13;
million) in January 1995 is inadequate for a company of this size and must be increased&#13;
(paras. 5.15-5.18).&#13;
C. FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS&#13;
5.13   Financial Overview. The financial projections for BJSC for the period 1996&#13;
through 2014 were undertaken using a detailed model of the company based on agreed&#13;
financial performance targets (Table 5.4), the minimum increase in coal price to ensure a&#13;
break-even position within five years, and other assumptions contained in Annx 5.1.&#13;
The resulting income statement, funds flow and balance sheet are outlined in detail in that&#13;
Annex and summarized in Table 5.3 below.&#13;
5.14   Production is projected to increase to 3.1 million tons in 1996, 3.8 million tons in&#13;
1997, and 4.0 million tons per year thereafter. Unit cash operating costs are expected to&#13;
increase in constant terms by 12 percent over 1994 levels to an average of $4.8 per ton&#13;
during 1996-2014 ($10 per ton coal equivalent-which is relatively low in international&#13;
terms). This includes adequate provision for maintenance, improvements in coal quality&#13;
6 In May 1995, under the direction of MEGM, receivables of $4.1 million from CHP Plant 4 were&#13;
assigned to, or set off against, other government agencies to reduce the amounts owned by BJSC. In&#13;
August 1995, BJSC, CHP Plants 3 and 4, the CES and Mongol Railways reached agreement on a strict,&#13;
month-by-month coal payment plan, which has been implemented effectively through the end of 1995.&#13;

financed by IDA and a cofinancier, and from BJSC's own internally generated resources.&#13;

5.15      As coal prices are gradually increased in constant US  dollar terms over the next&#13;
five years, BJSC will become financially independent with its financial position&#13;
improving from a projected loss in 1997 of $5.3 million to break even in 2000 and&#13;
thereafter gradually rising to a level of around $1.3 million as graphically depicted in&#13;
Chart 5.1 provided that all coal is promptly paid for and BJSC is allowed to write off the&#13;
increased annual depreciation allowances resulting from the formal revaluation of its&#13;
assets.&#13;
5.16   Coal Pricing. The Government has adopted a plan acceptable to IDA to regularly&#13;
increase the price of coal to enable BJSC to meet its financial covenants, generate&#13;
sufficient internal resources to meet its debt servicing obligations, and fund an&#13;
appropriate maintenance and capital equipment replacement program (ref. para. 5.21). A&#13;
price adjustment mechanism that incorporates the necessary principles is presented in&#13;
Annex 5.2. The plan calls for a gradual increase in real prices to a level of $7.50 per ton&#13;
in 2000, in 1995 constant price terms, representing a total increase in real terms of 34&#13;
percent over the 1995 average price level. In current terms, the plan provides for an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
increase in the average level of prices to $6.20/ton in 1996, $6.80/ton in 1997, rising&#13;
further each year to $8.50/ton in 2000 (see Table 5.4). Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that the plan will be implemented in accordance with its terms. Realization&#13;
of the planned average yearly price level in 1996 will require an increase in BJSC's coal&#13;
price to $6.80 during mid-year 1996. Action by the Borrower to increase the price of&#13;
BJSC 's coal to the equivalent of $6. 80 per ton (at a calorific value of 3, 360 kcal/ton), free&#13;
on rail at Baganuur, will be a condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;
5.17  Taxation. The amount of taxation paid by BJSC will be reduced significantly&#13;
with the revaluation of its existing assets, write-off of the undepreciated portion of the rail&#13;
haulage system and existing but obsolete coal-handling plant, the project's major capital&#13;
expenditure program and the resulting increase in depreciation allowances. Although&#13;
losses will not be carried forward for tax purposes, the Government has adopted a plan,&#13;
acceptable to IDA, to phase in the increased allowances over three years (ref. para. 5.21).&#13;
Under the plan, (a) all of BJSC's assets will be revalued to fair market price from&#13;
January 1, 1996 and annually thereafter as and when deemed necessary by BJSC in&#13;
accordance with IAS; and (b) all fixed assets, as revalued, will be depreciated annually&#13;
over their useful lives, and the annual depreciation provision will be deducted from&#13;
BJSC's income when calculating tax, with 50 percent of the depreciation provision&#13;
applied for tax purposes in 1996, 75 percent in 1997, and 100 percent thereafter.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the plan would be implemented in&#13;
accordance with its terms. Accordingly, BJSC's tax burden is expected to decline over&#13;
the next few years, but will resume in 2001 at an average level of approximately $1.0&#13;
million to $1.5 million annually.&#13;

5.18 Accounts Receivable and Working Capital Management. Appropriate pricing&#13;
and fiscal relief are not in themselves sufficient and BJSC has, in addition to vigorous&#13;
cost control, agreed to liquidate all excess working capital over a reasonable period of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
time. To achieve this, BJSC will strictly enforce the terms of its existing sales contracts,&#13;
with the Government's assistance, and collect all sales proceeds within 30 days of&#13;
delivery. BJSC, with the Government's endorsement and assurances with respect to&#13;
compliance by the Government's combined heat and power plants, has adopted a plan,&#13;
acceptable to IDA, to progressively reduce the average collection period by reducing the&#13;
arrears over a five-year period from 184 days at end-1995 to 30 days (ref. paras. 5.21,&#13;
5.22; see Table 5.4). Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the plan will be&#13;
implemented in accordance with its terms. With suitable training and the introduction of&#13;
an appropriate stores control and management system, inventories also will be&#13;
progressively run down or written off from a level of 418 days in 1994 to below 60 days.&#13;
5.19   Future Profitability.  With the provisions agreed with the Government and&#13;
efficiency improvements in BJSC, the company is projected to regain its financial&#13;
viability and begin to show net profits in 2001. The debt-to-total-capitalization ratio is&#13;
projected to peak at 67 percent during 1999-2001, and gradually decline thereafter.&#13;
BJSC's equity base will erode from $40.1 million to $24.5 million in 2000, but then&#13;
begin to recover. BJSC will become financially independent and will not require&#13;
concessional fimding or budgetary support. With output priced at $7.50/ton in 1995&#13;
terms, BJSC will show an average return on total capital employed of about 2.8 percent&#13;
during the first decade of the next century, which is low by international standards. As&#13;
the financial position of the energy sector in general improves, coal prices will need to be&#13;
further increased over time for BJSC to become commercially competitive with other&#13;
types of enterprises, debt worthy, and sufficiently attractive for full transfer to the private&#13;
sector.&#13;
D. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TARGETS&#13;
5.20   To ensure that prudent financial policies are implemented, the project's benefits&#13;
realized and its financial performance sustained at an acceptable level, BJSC has&#13;
undertaken to remain within the performance targets set out in Table 5.4 below.&#13;

(i)   regular adjustments in coal prices charged by BJSC according to a&#13;
plan acceptable to the Association;&#13;
(ii)   progressive reduction in the average collection periodfor payment&#13;
for coal supplied by BJSC to the Borrower's combined heat/power&#13;
plants, according to a plan acceptable to the Association; and&#13;
(iii)    BJSC is allowed the full deduction for tax purposes of the&#13;
depreciation provisions resulting from the application of&#13;
international accounting standards, according to a timetable&#13;
agreed with the Association.&#13;
5.22  At negotiations, IDA obtained assurances from BJSC that it will:&#13;
(a)   prepare project accounts and its annualfinancial statements and, together&#13;
with an independent audit report, submit these to IDA within 6 months of&#13;
its financial year end;&#13;
(b)   revalue its assets regularly in accordance with international accounting&#13;
standards and in compliance with government regulations;&#13;
(c)   not incur any further indebtedness unless its net revenues exceed, and are&#13;
projected to continue exceeding its debt service obligations by at least 1.6&#13;
times;&#13;
(d)   maintain a ratio of debt to equity of no greater than 70 to 30;&#13;
(e)   (i) attain a profit break-even by December 31, 2000 and maintain&#13;
profitability thereafter; and (ii) take all measures in its power to ensure&#13;
that the average collection periodfor payments for coal delivered shall be&#13;
progressively reducedfrom its current level to 30 days in accordance with&#13;
a plan and timetable acceptable to the Association; and&#13;
Ci)   provide IDA, by April 30 of each year, with a rolling five-year financial&#13;
plain containing BJSC's investment program, production plan and&#13;
projectedfinancial statements, and thereafter implement this plan, taking&#13;
into account IDA 's comments.&#13;

6. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. OVERVIEW&#13;
6.1   The proposed project is part of a coordinated effort of the international donors to&#13;
provide assistance, on an urgent basis, to improve the reliability of energy supply for the&#13;
country's urban economy and population. The proposed investment and associated&#13;
restructuring of BJSC is the surest, and most timely and economic means available to&#13;
stabilize coal production, overcome current coal shortages, and provide additional coal to&#13;
meet gradually increasing demand. The project supports two major objectives of IDA's&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy: removal of infrastructure bottlenecks and promotion of&#13;
further enterprise reform (para. 1.23). An integral part of the energy sector strategy under&#13;
recent IDA sector work, IDA support for rehabilitation in the coal sector will enable other&#13;
international donors to focus more on the rehabilitation of the main CHP plants, which is&#13;
also urgently needed (para. 1.28).&#13;
6.2   Based perhaps in part on Mongolia's development experience in the 1980s,&#13;
MEGM has projected sharp increases in future domestic coal demand and associated&#13;
substantial coal development investment scenarios. Given that market forces are just&#13;
developing in the coal subsector, and that the economy is undergoing considerable&#13;
restructuring during this transitional period, a far more conservative view of future&#13;
demand was used to analyze the merits of the proposed project (paras. 2.10-2.11). The&#13;
investments at Baganuur are optimal under the conservative demand scenario, or even yet&#13;
lower demand assumptions (paras. 2.12-2.13). In the event of more robust demand, the&#13;
mine development program at Baganuur could efficiently and relatively easily be&#13;
adjusted to accommodate higher productions levels, at some 6 Mtpy compared with the&#13;
planned 4 Mtpy. The incremental unit costs of higher production would in fact be lower,&#13;
further improving the economics of mine operations.&#13;
B. ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES&#13;
6.3   A variety of alternatives to meet coal demand were analyzed, including coal&#13;
imports, development of other mines, and use of different mining technology. The&#13;
proposed rehabilitation investment at Baganuur is both the least-cost alternative, and the&#13;
most reliable means to provide the coal supplies to meet the basic needs of the urban&#13;
population and requirements for power generation and industrial fuel.&#13;
6.4   The Alternative of Coal Imports. The economic cost of coal from Baganuur is&#13;
clearly well below the cost of imported coal. With the proposed investment, and using&#13;
economic shadow prices, the average economic cost of coal produced at Baganuur over&#13;
the life of the project is estimated at about $7.70/ton ex-mine. Adding the estimated&#13;
economic costs of transport and handling, and with adjustments for the low calorific&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
value of lignite, the average economic cost of coal from Baganuur is about $18.50/ton of&#13;
6,000 kcal/kg coal equivalent (tce). The international price of coal is in excess of $30/tce,&#13;
and uncompetitive.&#13;
6.5   However, Mongolia may be able to obtain coal from low-cost producers in Russia&#13;
or China at discounted prices. In the Kuzbass Basin in Russia, where very large surplus&#13;
production capacity exists, short-run marginal production costs are estimated to be as low&#13;
as $5.35/tce, in 1995 prices. Adjusting for transportation and handling costs, however,&#13;
costs would rise to about $18.80/tce delivered in Ulaanbaatar. Even in the unlikely event&#13;
that Mongolia could obtain prices based purely on short-run costs, from the lowest-cost&#13;
producers available, with no economic rent, Baganuur's costs would remain competitive.&#13;
Prices of imports from North China, where ex-mine prices are on the order of $15 to&#13;
$17/tce of medium quality coal would be higher, even with discounts.&#13;
6.6   Other Alternatives. There is no viable domestic alternative to the investment at&#13;
Baganuur to fully overcome current coal shortages and meet demand over the short and&#13;
medium term. Opportunities to expand production at Sharyn Gol are far more limited,&#13;
and incremental production costs over a sustained period are estimated to be $12 to&#13;
$15/ton of raw coal, ex-mine, or higher. At Shive Ovoo, the priority is to raise the quality&#13;
of coal currently produced to acceptable levels, and the feasibility of substantially&#13;
increasing marketable output remains uncertain. Continued use of the current mining&#13;
technology at Baganuur severely limits output, with unit costs that compare unfavorably&#13;
with the mine development scheme proposed under the project, notwithstanding that the&#13;
costs of existing equipment are already sunk.&#13;
C. BENEFIT-COST ANALYSIS&#13;
6.7   Benefit-cost analysis was completed for the proposed investment, analyzing the&#13;
incremental costs and benefits between full "with project" and "without project" cases,&#13;
and using shadow prices to reflect economic costs to the country (see Annex- 61). The&#13;
"with project" case models the economics of Baganuur's operation under the project for a&#13;
20-year period, including both initial and equipment replacement investments, and&#13;
reaching a targeted production level of 4 Mtpy in 1998. The "without project" case&#13;
models the economics of the mine's operation using existing technology, with little&#13;
investment until 2002, when significant equipment replacement costs must be incurred,&#13;
and with a production level of 2.5 Mtpy, due to the constraints posed by the existing&#13;
capability of the railway overburden removal system. The value of coal output is&#13;
conservatively estimated at just $7.80/ton, ex-mine, based on parity with coal imported&#13;
from the Kuzbass at well below international market prices.&#13;
6.8   The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project is estimated to be&#13;
24 percent, based on the incremental costs and benefits between the "with project" case&#13;
and the "without project" case. The net present value of the project is $17 million, at a&#13;
discount rate of 12 percent. Using the average projected financial price for Baganuur's&#13;
output, or $7.29/ton in 1995 prices, the EIRR of the project is estimated at 21 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
The EIRR is particularly robust because of the long-term cost advantages of the mobile&#13;
mining technology compared to the existing railway system. Unit cash operating costs&#13;
with the project are about 20 percent less than without the project. Moreover, although&#13;
relatively little investment is required until after 2000 in the "without project" case, unit&#13;
costs for equipment replacement are then relatively high.&#13;
6.9   The economics of Baganuur's future mining operation, as opposed to the&#13;
economics of just the proposed investment, are better captured by reviewing future&#13;
average production costs. Assuming a real discount rate of 12 percent per year, the&#13;
average economic cost of production is estimated at $7.70/ton. Even compared with the&#13;
estimated minimum possible import parity price of $7.80/ton, the mine would still yield a&#13;
small net present value of over the 20-year period of $3.5 million. With an import parity&#13;
price equivalent to $35/tce delivered to Ulaanbaatar, and more in line with standard&#13;
international prices, the net present value of Baganuur's operation rises to $200 million.&#13;
D. PROJECT RISKS AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;
6.10  The proposed project is ambitious. For the project to fully meet all of its&#13;
objectives, major changes are not only required in BJSC's operations, but also in BJSC's&#13;
financial operating environment. The principal risks identified with respect to project&#13;
implementation and financial sustainability comprise:&#13;
(a)    Risk that payments for coal to BJSC may be delayed, or that coal price or&#13;
fiscal reforms may be delayed, compromising BJSC's ability to become&#13;
financially self-sufficient;&#13;
(b)   Risk that BJSC will be unable to fully meet production and efficiency&#13;
targets, thereby compromising the project's benefits and BJSC's financial&#13;
position, due to delays in equipment delivery, lack of sufficient&#13;
management and supervision reform at BJSC, failure to implement&#13;
maintenance system improvements, or inadequate training;&#13;
(c)   Risk that BJSC will be unable to control unit operating costs due to&#13;
insufficient supervision, poor budgetary control or currency devaluations;&#13;
and&#13;
(d)   Risk that institutional weaknesses will not enable BJSC to implement the&#13;
project effectively or achieve necessary efficiency improvements.&#13;
6.11   These risks, if unmitigated, could impact the project's financial and economic&#13;
viability to the extent reflected in Table 6.1 below. The project's economic rate of return&#13;
remains strong even with substantial increases in operating costs or a reduction in the&#13;
mine's output by 10 percent over the life of the project. The financial rate of return of the&#13;
project falls to insufficient, although still positive levels, with major reductions in output&#13;
levels, failure to achieve any increase in real price levels, lack of tax policy changes, or a&#13;
major further increase in BJSC's accounts receivable.&#13;

6.12   The financial stability and solvency of BJSC as a whole is far more sensitive to&#13;
the risks identified than the investment project alone. Charts 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 provide an&#13;
assessment in nominal terms. Failure to implement agreed real price increases or tax&#13;
reforms, in particular, will place the company in an untenable situation. BJSC's equity&#13;
base could at worst be entirely eroded.&#13;

6.13   Accordingly, the project's design and its implementation plan include a strong&#13;
emphasis on measures to mitigate the risks of BJSC's financial instability or insolvency.&#13;
Well-known and tested mining technology will be employed, with a relatively simple&#13;
mine plan and substantial training and technical assistance in operations management and&#13;
supervision, to ensure that production targets can be met and that productivity gains can&#13;
be achieved. The Government is committed to implementation of the necessary price&#13;
reforms, income tax allowances in accordance with IAS, and a policy of timely payment&#13;
by consumers for coal deliveries, and IDA obtained assurances on these commitments at&#13;
negotiations (para. 5.21). Implementation of a substantial coal price increase will be a&#13;
condition of credit effectiveness. Risks will be further mitigated by intensive IDA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
supervision, during project implementation, and the deepening dialogue with the&#13;
Government on the energy sector associated with the planned second energy lending&#13;
operation.&#13;
6.14 Risks of serious project implementation difficulties have been minimized with a&#13;
major program to continue the process of upgrading BJSC's management and project&#13;
implementation capacity initiated with BJSC's incorporation in 1995, emphasized during&#13;
project preparation, and support through further training and technical assistance under&#13;
the project.&#13;

7. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1   The following assurances were obtained at negotiations:&#13;
(a)   From the Borrower that it would:&#13;
(i)   adopt a plan, by no later than December 31, 1996, satisfactory to&#13;
the Association, for the transfer of the authority to exercise all&#13;
rights and the requirement to fulfill all obligations of the Borrower&#13;
in its capacity as shareholder of BJSC from MEGM to an entity&#13;
fully independent from MEGM or any other organization, agency&#13;
or individual with responsibilities for any aspect of energy or&#13;
mining sector policy or regulation (para. 3.9);&#13;
(ii)   carry out the coal sector strategy technical assistance in accordance&#13;
with Terms of Reference and an implementation schedule&#13;
acceptable to the Association, and prepare and provide to IDA&#13;
annual progress reports on the implementation of the technical&#13;
assistance (para. 4.13);&#13;
(iii)   relend a portion of the proceeds of the Credit to BJSC under a&#13;
subsidiary loan agreement with terms and conditions approved by&#13;
the Association (para. 4.17);&#13;
(iv)    submit a mid-project review report, under terms of reference&#13;
satisfactory to the Association, to IDA by April 1, 1998, review&#13;
this report with the Association by June 1, 1998 and ensure&#13;
efficient completion of the project based on the recommendations&#13;
of this report and the Association's views on the matter (para.&#13;
4.35);&#13;
(v)    ensure that BJSC will be able to comply with its financial&#13;
performance targets agreed with IDA, by ensuring, in particular,&#13;
a. regular adjustments in coal prices charged by BJSC according to&#13;
a plan acceptable to the Association, and b. progressive reduction&#13;
in the average collection period for payment for coal supplied by&#13;
BJSC to the Borrower's combined heat/power plants, according to&#13;
a plan acceptable to the Association (para. 5.21);&#13;
(vi)   allow BJSC the full deduction for tax purposes of the depreciation&#13;
provisions resulting from the application of international&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

ANNEX 4.1: PROJECT PERFORMANCE MONITORING&#13;
INDICATORS&#13;
1.    The performance of the project in meeting its objectives (para. 4.5 in the main&#13;
text) will be closely monitored throughout the life of the project, based on the criteria&#13;
outlined below. These criteria assume that the proposed credit will become effective&#13;
during the summer of 1996.&#13;
Objective A: Achievement and Maintenance of Coal Production of 4 Mtpy&#13;
2.    The main objective of the proposed project is to reverse the decline in Mongolia's&#13;
coal production by increasing sustainable production levels at the Baganuur mine to&#13;
4 million tons per year (Mtpy). Performance will be monitored against the following&#13;
production objectives:&#13;
Objective                       Unit       1997  1998  1999  2000-2014&#13;
Coal production            million tons/year   3.5/a  4.0   4.0    4.0&#13;
Truck and shovel overburden   million bcm/year   9.0/a 10.0  10.0  9.6&#13;
removal&#13;
Coal handling plant throughput million tons/year  --  3.5   3.5   3.54.01k&#13;
La The production target for 1997 is 3.8 million tons of coal, with truck and shovel&#13;
overburden removal of 9.9 million bcm. Criteria here are minimum performance&#13;
levels.&#13;
lk Throughput of 4.0 million tons per year should be achieved by 2005 by the latest.&#13;
Objective B: BJSC's Financial Self-Sufficiency&#13;
3.    A key objective is for BJSC to develop a healthy financial position without&#13;
government financial support. The fundamental objective is for BJSC to (a) generate and&#13;
maintain an annual net profit, including all capital investment costs according to&#13;
International Accounting Standards (IAS) , by the year 2001 and every year thereafter,&#13;
and (b) achieve this without government subsidies or grants for either operating or&#13;
investment costs. To enable BJSC to meet these objectives, the Government has agreed&#13;
to implement the following coal price increases, and to ensure that the power industry&#13;
makes timely payments to allow the following reductions in BJSC's accounts receivable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

4.    Additional key measures include: (a) a full phase-in for income tax purposes of&#13;
depreciation provisions in line with IAS by 1998 or sooner; (b) maintenance of a debt to&#13;
equity ratio of not greater than 70 to 30; and (c) maintenance of a debt service coverage&#13;
ratio of at least 1.6.&#13;
Objective C: Increase Equipment Productivity and Improve Efficiency at BJSC&#13;
5.    Achievement of this objective will be monitored against the following&#13;
performance criteria:&#13;
(a)   Operation of shovels for 10 shifts/week, 50 weeks/year; and operating&#13;
dump trucks for 12 shifts/week, 50 weeks/year.&#13;
(b)   Increase in the effective shift operating hours to at least 7.4 in 1996; 8.3 in&#13;
1997; 9.0 in 1998; 9.5 in 1999, and 10.0 in 2000.&#13;
(c)   Maintain minimum shovel availability of at least 70 percent.&#13;
(d)   Maintain minimum shovel productivity of 492 bcm/hour for 8-10 m3 units,&#13;
and 285 bcrn/hour for 5 m3 units.&#13;
(e)   Ensure truck and auxiliary mine equipment availabilities as warranted by&#13;
suppliers under ICB procurement warranty requirements.&#13;
6.    With these and other measures, unit cash operating costs(excluding depreciation)&#13;
will gradually increase from the 1994 level of $4.30/ton to no more than $4.80/ton during&#13;
2000-04 (in 1995 prices). The higher cash operating costs result from maintenance of an&#13;
overburden removal program consistent with a stable coal production level of 4 million&#13;
tons, and improvements in coal quality and environmental management. These unit cash&#13;
operating costs represent a major reduction compared to projected costs of $6.00/ton in&#13;
the without-project case.&#13;
Objective D: BJSC Should Operate as an Independent Commercial Company&#13;
7.    BJSC has already been established as an independent shareholding company.&#13;
Further progress in the company's restructuring program will be monitored during project&#13;
implementation, including, in particular:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -                    ANNEX 4.1&#13;
(a)   Adoption by the Government of a plan, satisfactory to IDA, by&#13;
December 31, 1996, to transfer authority to act on behalf of the&#13;
government as owner of the government's shares in BJSC to an agency&#13;
fully independent from MEGM or other agencies involved in energy or&#13;
mining sector policy or regulation;&#13;
(b)   Progress in implementation of BJSC's manpower reduction program&#13;
(Annex 4.12);&#13;
(c)   Implementation  of improved  mine  operational management and&#13;
supervision, maintenance, and financial control and accounting within&#13;
BJSC, during 1997-99, assisted through relevant training and TA; and&#13;
(d)   Financial performance, as monitored under Objective B above.&#13;
Objective E: BJSC Should Operate in an Environmentally Sustainable Manner&#13;
8.    Achievement of this objective will be monitored within the framework of the&#13;
agreed Environmental Management Program (EMP) in Annex 4.11. Criteria important&#13;
for the process include (a) the establishment of a functioning Environmental Management&#13;
Unit within BJSC during 1996, and training of the Unit's staff during 1997-99;&#13;
(b) completion of the project's environmental training and TA component during&#13;
1997-99; and (c) preparation of biannual environmental monitoring reports throughout&#13;
the project implementation period. As further detailed in Annex 4.11, key criteria for&#13;
evaluation of this objective include:&#13;
(a)   Mitigation of any adverse impacts on the small lake near to the mine site,&#13;
in the unlikely event that mine operations impact the lake's water level;&#13;
(b)   Implementation of the time-bound reclamation program; and&#13;
(c)   Implementation of fugitive dust, hazardous waste management and&#13;
occupational health and safety plans in the EMP.&#13;

ANNEX 4.2: BAGANUUR COAL MINE REHABILITATION&#13;
DEVELOPMENT PLAN&#13;
9.    Central to the BJSC mine rehabilitation development plan is technological&#13;
renovation encompassing, primarily, the replacement of the traditional and historically&#13;
inefficient rail overburden removal system by large-scale (85-ton) Western dump trucks.&#13;
In addition, the mine development plan encompasses the introduction of larger-scale&#13;
auxiliary mine equipment (320-550 hp track bulldozers, 310 hp wheel bulldozers, high-&#13;
capacity 275 hp motor graders, and various ancillary equipment items (lowboys, fuel and&#13;
lubrication trucks, tire trucks, etc.). All of these physical rehabilitation steps are designed&#13;
to: (a) restore the BJSC operation to its former production rate of 4.0 million tons coal&#13;
per year on a sustainable and environmentally acceptable level; (b) enhance the efficiency&#13;
of the various mine excavation (overburden and coal) and haulage systems; and (c) secure&#13;
the delivery of a reliable fuel supply to Ulaanbaatar CHPs. A new coal-handling plant&#13;
will be designed and constructed in order to improve the reliability (size range and coal&#13;
quality) of the coal product deliveries.&#13;
10.  IBRD Drawing 27479 indicates the mine development plan over the 1995-2014,&#13;
20-year period. On the basis of international mine planning standards, end-year mine&#13;
bench locations are illustrated annually over the coming five-year period and at five-year&#13;
intervals thereafter. The mine life based on available proven reserves is considerably&#13;
beyond 2014. Although specific mine development boundaries have not been planned&#13;
beyond 2014, the mine development planning has taken into account the future coal seam&#13;
extraction to avoid short-term "high grading" of the coal deposit and to allow for the&#13;
positive economics of the BJSC operation to be maintained throughout its life cycle. As&#13;
indicated on the Drawing, attempts have been made to develop mining benches that are&#13;
more continuous than was previously the case. In earlier years, coal extraction was&#13;
undertaken in a number of discontinuous areas and as overburden removal by the rail&#13;
system lagged further behind planned levels, BJSC was forced to extract coal in the lower&#13;
stripping ratio areas to ensure that coal production was maximized to the extent possible.&#13;
Coal operations at the Pit 61 (Coal Seam #2) were discontinued in 1994. Coal extraction&#13;
in Mountain Section 3 (Reserve Pit) (Coal Seam #3) will be continued through 1999 until&#13;
taken over by the advancing benches of the main Mountain Section 2 area, which will&#13;
thereafter extract coal seams # 2a and 3 (coal seam 2 in this area is thin and of poorer&#13;
quality and will not be taken within the Mountain Section 2 coal extraction operation.&#13;
The mine development plan focuses on the orderly down-dip development of the western&#13;
and southern sections of the Main Pit (Mountain Sections 1-coal seams # 2 and 2a, and&#13;
Mountain Section 2-coal seam 2a, and 3 after 1999 and the discontinuation of Mountain&#13;
Section 3) and the further down-dip development of Mountain Section 5 (coal seam #2),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -                     ANNEX 4.2&#13;
to the south. Commencing in the year 2000, and in order to maintain a relatively constant&#13;
stripping ratio in the 3.5-4.0 range, Mountain Section 5 Extension will be developed&#13;
from Coal Seam #2 outcrop in order to connect the Main Pit (Mountain Section 2) to&#13;
Mountain Section 5 and to provide for an 8-kilometer long open-pit strike length.&#13;
Progressive development of Mountain Sections 1, 2, and 5 will continue at higher&#13;
stripping ratios in parallel to the low stripping ratio Mountain Section 5 Extension area to&#13;
maintain a balanced overall (3.5-4.0) stripping ratio and predictably uniform mine&#13;
economics. As the Mountain Section 5 Extension area progresses down-dip and into&#13;
higher stripping ratios, the northern flank of the Mountain Section 1 (Mountain Section 4)&#13;
will commence development at Coal Seam #2A outcrop, starting in 2010. Details of the&#13;
annual overburden and coal production schedules for the various mine sections are&#13;
attached to this Annex.&#13;
11.   Overburden removal will be transferred from the Main Pit rail system at the time&#13;
of delivery of the large dump truck fleet (anticipated mid- to late 1996). Thereafter,&#13;
overburden will be removed by the existing Former Soviet Union (FSU) EKG 5 and 8&#13;
cubic meters (mi3) rope crowd excavators, loading the new 85-ton dump trucks. The final&#13;
overburden bench overlying the coal seam will be removed by the existing fleet of 10-&#13;
20 m3 draglines, some of which will operate in tandem in order to provide for optimal&#13;
overburden dump placement. Coal extraction will continue to be undertaken by the&#13;
existing 5.0 m 3 rope shovels loading the existing fleet of 18-23 ton Belaz (FSU) and&#13;
Komatsu (Japan) trucks. This coal truck fleet will be replaced at the end of its useful life&#13;
(1998) with a fleet of larger (40-ton) coal dump trucks. Existing 5-8 mi3 overburden rope&#13;
shovels will be replaced progressively at the end of their useful life by more flexible 10-&#13;
11 m3 front-end loaders. The smaller (4-5 mi3) rope shovels operating in coal will be&#13;
progressively replaced by 6 m3 loaders. By 2005, all existing rope shovels will have been&#13;
retired and replaced by front-end loaders&#13;
12.   The mine development plan, minimizes the use of existing equipment by&#13;
emphasizing increased levels of the equipment productivity of the larger-size excavators.&#13;
By adopting international norms of shifts worked per year, equipment productivity and&#13;
thus effective operating hours per shift, the mine development plan will ensure enhanced&#13;
mine economics. At present the mine operates 14 rope shovels (four 8 m 3 units, five 5 m3&#13;
units, three 4.6 mi3 unit and two 4 mi3 units) and one 5.8 mi3 front-end loader. A 10 m3&#13;
shovel provided under earlier FSU assistance has never been commissioned and can be&#13;
considered as potentially unserviceable. The mine development plan (starting in 1997&#13;
following removal of the rail overburden system and its replacement with large dump&#13;
trucks) provides for the use of only four of the existing 8 m3 shovels and one 5 m unit on&#13;
overburden excavation and only three 5 m3 shovels and the 5.8 m3 loader on coal&#13;
excavation. Thus, a number of the smaller overburden and coal excavators can and will&#13;
be taken out of service and put on a care and maintenance basis such that labor and&#13;
maintenance costs can be reduced, minimizing the overall level of the coal mine&#13;
operating costs. In addition, out of the seven 10-20 m3 draglines currently in operation,&#13;
two operating in existing rail dumps will be discontinued and two of the five draglines&#13;
traditionally operating on the overburden bench overlying coal seams will become&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-67 -                      ANNEX 4.2&#13;
unnecessary by 1997/98 and will be taken out of service and either sold or placed on care&#13;
and maintenance, thus further reducing the level of overall mine operating costs .&#13;
13.   Overburden excavation and coal production targets utilizing only the large-scale&#13;
main mining equipment will be achieved by a combination of (a) refocused mine&#13;
organization and management, and more effective mine operations supervision, assisted&#13;
by training and technical assistance programs; (b) increased equipment availability (a&#13;
minimum of 70 percent for shovels, and 80 percent for trucks) and thus the number of&#13;
effective operating shifts (490) per year for individual truck/shovel combinations;&#13;
(c) increase in effective operating hours per shift (from the present level of 6 hours per&#13;
12-hour operating shift up to 10 hours per shift by 2000, close to international levels);&#13;
and (d) by the procurement of larger-scale mine support equipment (bulldozers, graders&#13;
and an additional front-end loader) to improve mine bench conditions, support main&#13;
mining equipment fleets and to generally enhance in-pit housekeeping.&#13;
14.   The existing coal handling plant cannot produce a satisfactory coal product for&#13;
Ulaanbaatar CHPs. The size range of deliveries (up to 300 mm) is unmanageable and&#13;
coal quality is seriously affected by overburden (ash) contamination. In addition, the&#13;
original design does not provide for a satisfactory health and safety environment for&#13;
operating personnel and is intrinsically unsafe. The plant has experienced in the past&#13;
various internal explosions and resultant collapse. Preliminary engineering undertaken&#13;
during project preparation has identified the conceptual components of a new coal&#13;
handling plant and a new plant will be developed on a turnkey basis, following&#13;
international detailed engineering. The pant will provide for all coal to be crushed and&#13;
sized (at minus 50 mm), stored by linear stacker, recovered by an underground reclaimer&#13;
and loaded onto rail. A new rail spur will be developed from the existing line and a haul&#13;
road constructed to the plant from Mountain Section 5 area. The plant will be located&#13;
approximately in the location of the present coal-handling plant, its final location to be&#13;
optimized during detailed engineering works. The new plant will provide for a consistent&#13;
coal quality of minimum 3,500 kcal/kg (exceeding minimum 3,200 kcal/kg heat content&#13;
required by the Ulaanbaatar CHPs).&#13;

ANNEX 4.3: MINE MAINTENANCE PLAN&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Mine maintenance (workshop) and materials (warehouse) operations at Baganuur&#13;
are not well developed. Although lack of funding has led to low levels of spare parts&#13;
stocks, the poor mine and equipment performance (utilization and availability) over&#13;
recent years has been due essentially to underdeveloped maintenance and materials&#13;
management systems. There is currently a poor maintenance organizational structure and&#13;
a low maintenance skill level at BJSC. A program containing essential elements of&#13;
preventative maintenance, planned corrective maintenance and planned equipment&#13;
replacement is absent. Although there is a form of maintenance planning, only a limited&#13;
percentage of maintenance tasks are on schedule and detailed schedules of maintenance&#13;
tasks have not been prepared, which has lead to ineffective maintenance management.&#13;
Restructuring of the whole maintenance function from an organization and direction/&#13;
control viewpoint is required including workshop reconstruction and retooling, in order to&#13;
provide adequate support to production activities and in order for BJSC to be able to&#13;
operate on a reliable coal production basis and in a financially self-sufficient manner.&#13;
Development Plan&#13;
2.    Maintenance planning is recognized as a prerequisite to efficient mining operation&#13;
and therefore a function that must be planned in consultation with production&#13;
management personnel. Such planning is recognized as a key tool in each area of the&#13;
maintenance function. As a first step toward efficient maintenance management, a&#13;
systematic approach will be developed to work identification and documentation.&#13;
Estimates will be prepared for the labor, materials and tools required to fulfill individual&#13;
work orders. A work order backlog system will be developed to identify and monitor&#13;
maintenance activities. Maintenance scheduling will be introduced in order to develop&#13;
maintenance programs that assist maintenance planning, requisitioning and future labor&#13;
requirements. This will facilitate the formulation of future maintenance requirements&#13;
including a weekly maintenance plan and arrangement of maintenance equipment, tools,&#13;
spares and labor availability. A preventative maintenance program and agenda will be&#13;
developed. Maintenance will be organized in relation to production needs and BJSC will&#13;
develop a detailed schedule of mine equipment to be maintained, a schedule of individual&#13;
maintenance tasks to be performed, a schedule of when individual tasks need to be&#13;
performed, a program to ensure that such tasks are undertaken, and documentation to&#13;
record the results and effectiveness of the maintenance function.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70-                     ANNEX 4.3&#13;
3.    A skills assessment of existing maintenance personnel will be undertaken; present&#13;
indications are that approximately 50 percent of maintenance staff are not adequately&#13;
experienced or trained to perform required maintenance tasks/functions. Training&#13;
programs will be developed to upgrade maintenance management and maintenance skills&#13;
encompassing areas and types of training required, training modules needed, and a&#13;
schedule for future training. Skill requirements will be identified against international&#13;
standards with skills assessed, training programs developed, reference materials prepared,&#13;
a training schedule developed, and learning path development formulated.&#13;
4.    Although materials in the mine warehouse are on a computerized data entry&#13;
system, this is simply to identify the existence and location of spares. There is no system&#13;
of minimum stock level identification and computerized reordering and requisitioning. A&#13;
complete overhaul of the materials management system is planned so that materials&#13;
availability can be efficiently managed and provide the necessary material inputs to&#13;
maintenance (workshop) management and functions.&#13;
5.    This maintenance development plan will lead by end-1998 to the development of&#13;
a well-organized and permanent BJSC system of maintenance documentation, planning,&#13;
execution and follow-up, that approaches international maintenance policies, practices&#13;
and procedures and that will permit mine equipment to reach and sustain international&#13;
levels of equipment productivity. The development and implementation of effective&#13;
maintenance and materials management systems will be created by a combination of&#13;
overseas training of key BJSC maintenance and materials management personnel as well&#13;
as by in-country assistance by international experts who will help address skills&#13;
requirements and availability, training requirements and training instruction, and effective&#13;
maintenance and materials management system development (see Annex 4.4).&#13;

ANNEX 4.4: TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN&#13;
MINE MANAGEMENT, SUPERVISION AND OPERATIONS&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    BJSC will rehabilitate its open-pit coal operation to reach a sustainable production&#13;
level of 4 million tons coal per year and to increase the overall efficiency of the mine's&#13;
operation, thus providing a reliable and low cost coal supply for the country's combined&#13;
heat and power plants in Ulaanbaatar. Although new mining equipment will be procured&#13;
(and particularly large-scale dump trucks that will replace the existing overburden rail&#13;
haulage system) and a new coal-handling plant constructed, training is required to expose&#13;
BJSC executives and personnel to the best international coal mine management and&#13;
operations practices and procedures.&#13;
2.    BJSC has prepared a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) focusing on all aspects of&#13;
the coal mine rehabilitation and this PIP has benefited from inputs by various&#13;
international consultants including specialists from Coopers and Lybrand, Canada (mine&#13;
organization and management), Morrison Knudsen, United States (mine operations and&#13;
planning) and Performance Associates, United States. Relevant sections of these inputs&#13;
are incorporated in the PIP and provide further background to the following Scope of&#13;
Services.&#13;
Scope of Services&#13;
3.    BJSC requires training in the areas of corporate management, mine planning,&#13;
mine operations and supervision, mine maintenance and materials management, and mine&#13;
cost engineering. The most important areas are mine operations and supervision, and&#13;
maintenance and materials management. Maintenance and materials management should&#13;
account for 40 to 45 percent of the total resource inputs, mine operations and supervision&#13;
for roughly 25 percent, corporate management for about 20 percent, mine planning for 5&#13;
to 10 percent and cost engineering for about 5 percent. In each area, training should&#13;
include a well-coordinated combination of on-site advice and technical assistance from&#13;
international specialists concerning international norms, practices, and options for&#13;
improvements at Baganuur to BJSC management, on-the-job training for BJSC&#13;
personnel, and arrangements of overseas study and/or training visits for BJSC personnel.&#13;
All international and local consultants will report to BJSC management. Broad outlines&#13;
of requirements in each area are provided below. As there is considerable overlap and&#13;
need for integration in the training work in each area, implementation of the various&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -                     ANNEX 4.4&#13;
training components also needs to be closely coordinated. More detailed Terms of&#13;
Reference will be issued at the outset of project implementation.&#13;
Corporate Management&#13;
4.    Although the executives of BJSC are fully committed to coal mine rehabilitation&#13;
under the developing market economy in Mongolia, training is required to assist the&#13;
executives to focus further on organizational and manpower development (including&#13;
manpower reduction), production and equipment/labor productivity, cost and other&#13;
efficiency targets and goals that need to be better established to reach, maintain and&#13;
monitor effectively improvements in company and mine performance. Of particular&#13;
importance is training of BJSC executives in operating in a market economy setting and&#13;
with financial accountability to shareholders, including the development of clear&#13;
corporate objectives and related production, financial, marketing and environmental&#13;
strategies and plans. In addition, corporate management would benefit from training in&#13;
the identification and development of job skills (experience and qualifications) definition&#13;
for mine management (superintendents, supervisors, foremen, etc.) and in the establish-&#13;
ment and enforcement of job responsibilities and accountabilities for these positions.&#13;
Training in the appropriate methods to motivate all levels of the mine work force is also&#13;
required and the company needs to develop better, journeyman-type career paths for its&#13;
personnel, particularly at the operator/maintenance personnel level. Training programs&#13;
for corporate executives down through supervisors/foremen to operators/maintenance&#13;
personnel need to be developed.&#13;
Mine Development Planning&#13;
J.    Detailed annual mine rehabilitation plans have been prepared. Training in short-&#13;
term mine planning tools and techniques (allocation and location of equipment fleets!&#13;
types and efficient allocation/utilization of auxiliary and ancillary mine equipment) is&#13;
required. Mine planning tools and techniques remain manual and a review is required of&#13;
potential computer software applications to fast-track coal reserves and coal quality&#13;
evaluations and mine plan forecasts; mine bench development; equipment productivity&#13;
forecasting and monitoring; labor requirements; and planned and actual equipment and&#13;
labor productivity. Assistance in the implementation of appropriate software packages&#13;
and training in its utilization is required.&#13;
Mine Operations and Supervision&#13;
6.    Mine operations remain characterized by relatively low levels of production and&#13;
productivity, and improved mine practices and procedures (equipment applications,&#13;
bench development techniques, loading and haulage practices and effective utilization of&#13;
auxiliary and ancillary mine equipment) need to be introduced. Mine personnel need to&#13;
be trained in improved mining practices and procedures, both generally, and specifically&#13;
in connection with the technological shift to sole reliance on trucks and shovels for&#13;
overburden removal. Training is particularly needed for superintendents, supervisors and&#13;
foremen, so that efficiency and productivity can be raised to at least the levels set out in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-73 -                      ANNEX 4.4&#13;
the project's key performance criteria (Annex 4.1). Further guidance on training of&#13;
equipment operators (particularly in relation to the large-scale mobile mining equipment&#13;
to be procured under the IDA-financed project) will be required. Methods of improving&#13;
general in-pit housekeeping should be addressed.&#13;
7.    Following review of existing documents concerning BJSC's mine plan and&#13;
initiatives to improve mine operational efficiency, and completion of a brief diagnostic&#13;
review, international specialists in mine supervision and operation should agree with&#13;
BJSC management on a comprehensive technical assistance and training work program in&#13;
the above areas. The diagnostic review should include a review of training to be provided&#13;
by equipment suppliers and recommendation of any additional operational and&#13;
maintenance training. The subsequent work program should include on-site technical&#13;
assistance and training by international experts, and training overseas for BJSC mine&#13;
management personnel, including study and discussion of all aspects of mine supervision&#13;
and operations (e.g., organization and accountability of supervisory personnel, mine&#13;
development approaches, international levels of equipment and labor productivity,&#13;
utilization of auxiliary and ancillary equipment fleets, shift scheduling and monitoring).&#13;
Mine Maintenance and Materials Management&#13;
8.    The efficiency of the BJSC coal mine operation is constrained by the lack of&#13;
effective maintenance and materials management systems. Maintenance planning and&#13;
scheduling is basically nonexistent and the important linkage between effective&#13;
maintenance and the attainment of predictable production outputs is not well appreciated&#13;
by maintenance personnel. There is no systematic approach to maintenance work&#13;
identification and documentation, and work order discipline is poor. The impact of the&#13;
above factors can be illustrated by the fact that truck breakdown maintenance frequency&#13;
has escalated progressively from 36 percent in 1993 to 60 percent in 1994. Maintenance&#13;
tools, machinery and facilities are below international standards but will be upgraded&#13;
under the IDA-financed project.&#13;
9.    BJSC is undertaking a complete overhaul of the mine's system for equipment and&#13;
facility maintenance and materials management. The company has instituted a new&#13;
organizational setup, consolidating maintenance responsibilities under one deputy&#13;
director (Annex 3.1) In the new organizational framework, workshop and warehouse&#13;
organization and management will be overhauled. BJSC requires technical advice and&#13;
guidance in the development and implementation of its new system, and extensive&#13;
training of relevant personnel. International experts are needed initially to advise BJSC&#13;
senior management on the final design and implementation plan for the revised&#13;
maintenance and materials management systems, and to assist in the completion of an&#13;
assessment of existing skills in the maintenance area and of detailed staff training&#13;
requirements. Assistance also is required in the implementation of the new program and&#13;
in completing the detailed training work identified. In addition to on-site technical&#13;
assistance and training, BJSC personnel should visit selective international mine&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -                      ANNEX 4.4&#13;
maintenance facilities to familiarize themselves with international best practices and&#13;
procedures for maintenance and materials management, organization and operation.&#13;
Mine Cost Engineering&#13;
10.   Work activity documentation, analysis and monitoring at Baganuur is not well&#13;
developed as a tool for efficient mine cost engineering and significant opportunities exist&#13;
for increasing mine efficiencies and lowering unit production costs. Full and meaningful&#13;
documentation for equipment and operator activity and performance, and for all&#13;
maintenance activities, needs to be developed for the preparation and analysis of&#13;
production costs and meaningful budgets forecasts. Detailed formats for describing and&#13;
documenting daily shift responsibilities, practices, consumption and costs including&#13;
personnel assignments and responsibilities need to be developed.  Documentation&#13;
(supervisor reports, time cards and production/productivity monitors, etc.) should be&#13;
formulated so that mine cost engineering mechanisms can be developed to provide&#13;
effective feedback and corrective actions.&#13;
Budget and Timing&#13;
11.  It is anticipated that the assignment can be completed within a budget of $1&#13;
million, including the cost of specialists and their travel, subsistence and miscellaneous&#13;
costs. and including the cost of travel, subsistence and miscellaneous costs of overseas&#13;
training for BJSC personnel. The latter costs should be delineated and included in the&#13;
assignment description and assignment cost estimate. Consultant proposals should not be&#13;
bound by cost estimates and proposals should be submitted on the basis of analysis of&#13;
work inputs required to complete the assignment and to address fully the Scope of&#13;
Services. It is anticipated that the assignment would commence by the end of 1996 or at&#13;
such date as the procurement to the major mine equipment items scheduled for IDA&#13;
financing is completed.&#13;

ANNEX 4.5: TRAINING FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND&#13;
SAFETY MANAGEMENT UNIT&#13;
Objectives&#13;
1.    The overall objective of this training and technical assistance is to assist BJSC to&#13;
establish an in-house capability to undertake the environmental management activities&#13;
detailed in the BJSC Environmental Management Program (EMP, see Annex 4.11), and the&#13;
Environmental Analysis Report (EAR) for this project, available in the project file.&#13;
Currently, there is no environmental management or monitoring capability in the company.&#13;
Institutional capabilities in occupational health and safety also need to be improved. As&#13;
outlined in the EMP and EAR, an Environmental Management Unit (EMU) will be&#13;
established in BJSC, led by a suitably qualified Environment and Safety Manager, and also&#13;
staffed with an Environmental Technician, an Occupational Health and Safety Engineer,&#13;
and assisted by an Environmental Engineer for Reclamation. A small laboratory also will&#13;
be established at the EMU. The purpose of the training and technical assistance is to work&#13;
together with BJSC management and this unit to design and implement the unit's detailed&#13;
work program and to provide formal and on-the-job training to the unit's staff, to enable&#13;
them to implement the EMP.&#13;
Scope of Services&#13;
2.    BJSC will recruit/assign appropriate staff for the EMU with the necessary technical&#13;
qualifications and experience to fulfill the assignments outlined in the EMP. Training&#13;
requirements will therefore be aimed at specific development of skills in environmental&#13;
management and occupational health and safety of mining operations. Training and&#13;
development requirements will be achieved by a combination of visits by foreign experts&#13;
and periods of secondment of the BJSC Environmental Unit staff to select mining&#13;
operations in industrialized countries. Periods of secondment would include specific short&#13;
course training and short study visits to the selected mining operations. The Environment&#13;
and Safety Manager, the Occupational Health and Safety Engineer and the Environmental&#13;
Engineer will each undertake a one-month secondment. In addition, international experts&#13;
will visit BJSC to provide technical assistance on-site, and to conduct intensive training at&#13;
the mine, especially after BJSC personnel have completed their secondment with overseas&#13;
counterparts. The training will cover intensive in-country work, and follow-up visits after&#13;
BJSC personnel participate in periods of secondment with their counterparts overseas.&#13;
International specialist requirements are planned at a total of 9.5 person-months, as set out&#13;
below.&#13;

ANNEX 4.6: COST AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING SYSTEM&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS&#13;
(TERMS OF REFERENCE)&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Government of Mongolia has applied to the International Development&#13;
Association (IDA) for a credit amounting to $35 million, $33.5 million of which is to be&#13;
onlent to the Baganuur Coal Mining Company (BJSC) to rehabilitate its open-pit mine&#13;
situated some 120 miles west of Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. It is intended to&#13;
apply part of these proceeds to provide critical (technical, financial, environmental and&#13;
marketing) support to BJSC. The financial component, which is covered under these&#13;
terms-of-reference, will provide BJSC with assistance to: upgrade the company's cost and&#13;
financial accounting, and management information systems; select and implement a&#13;
simplified off-the-shelf local area network (LAN) and appropriate accounting software;&#13;
undergo training in International Accounting Standards (IAS); and prepare for its&#13;
inaugural annual financial audit.&#13;
2.    BJSC intends to rehabilitate its open-pit coal operation in order to reach again the&#13;
4 million tons coal per year mine production design capacity on a sustainable basis and to&#13;
increase the overall efficiency of the mine's operation, thus providing for a secure and&#13;
reliable and low-cost coal supply for CES Ulaanbaatar power plants. Although new&#13;
mining equipment will be procured (particularly large-scale dump trucks that will replace&#13;
the existing overburden rail haulage system) and new coal-handling plant constructed,&#13;
implementation of modem accounting systems and training is also required to enable&#13;
BJSC executives and personnel to adopt international best coal mine financial&#13;
management, cost control and management information reporting practices.&#13;
3.    BJSC has prepared a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) focusing on all aspects of&#13;
the coal mine rehabilitation. This PIP has benefited from inputs by various international&#13;
consultants including specialists from Arthur Anderson, Australia (compilation of IAS&#13;
Financial Statements as at end-1994 and review of BJSC Financial Management and&#13;
Systems), Coopers and Lybrand, Canada (mine organization and management), Morrison&#13;
Knudsen, United States (mine operations and planning) and Performnance Associates,&#13;
United States. Relevant sections of these inputs are incorporated in the PIP and provide&#13;
further background to the following Scope of Services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -                     ANNEX 4.6&#13;
Scope of Services&#13;
4.    The accounting systems at BJSC were developed by Soviet specialists and do not&#13;
follow IAS principles or formats. Consequently, income statements do not permit clear&#13;
identification of net income, funds flow and profitability. The balance sheet merely&#13;
records historic assets and liabilities which, in a hyperinflationary environment, will need&#13;
to be significantly restated. Under a recent government decree all companies in Mongolia&#13;
will be required to adopt IAS and revalue their assets as from January 1, 1996.&#13;
5.    Assistance will be provided to undertake a comprehensive analysis of capital and&#13;
operating costs and to upgrade the cost, financial and management systems, with an end-&#13;
product being the restatement of the BJSC 1997 financial statements (income statement,&#13;
balance sheet and sources and application of funds) according to IAS. These statements&#13;
should be presented in a final report that outlines the full findings of the evaluation of the&#13;
cost, financial and management systems, systems implemented and recommendation.&#13;
BJSC financial and accounting personnel should also be trained in the preparation of&#13;
financial statements consistent with IAS, and should be able to manipulate the software&#13;
packages and models acquired or developed during the assignment, for future years&#13;
financial statements.&#13;
6.    Building on previous work, the cost and financial accounting systems and&#13;
management information systems will be reviewed with BJSC management and a time-&#13;
bound action plan should at the outset of the assignment be agreed covering:&#13;
*    improvements to individual systems;&#13;
*    implementation of new off-the-shelf systems, both manual and computer,&#13;
where necessary;&#13;
*    procedural changes to data capture, cost control, recording and reporting;&#13;
and&#13;
*    control procedures and audit requirements&#13;
7.    The review of operating cost system will focus on, and deal with the provision of&#13;
simple computerized:&#13;
*    costing systems, cost centers, responsibility costing, and code of accounts&#13;
and structure;&#13;
*    reporting of costs by process, element and responsibility center;&#13;
*    salaries and wages systems;&#13;
*    stores purchasing system relating to procedures and prices on both stock&#13;
and non-stock items; and&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -                    ANNEX 4.6&#13;
*    stores requisition, cost allocation and control.&#13;
This work will need to be closely coordinated with the technical assistance work for&#13;
maintenance system improvement (Annex 4.4).&#13;
8.    The Capital Cost and Investments review will focus on, and deal with the&#13;
provision of simple computerized:&#13;
*    authorization procedures, levels of authority and capital payments systems;&#13;
and&#13;
*    recording of acquisitions, disposals, maintenance of asset register, asset&#13;
revaluation and revised depreciation schedules.&#13;
9.    The review of Financial Accounting Systems and Management of CurrenLAssets&#13;
will focus on, and deal with the provision of simple computerized:&#13;
*    creditor's control, aging and payment;&#13;
*    revenue receipts, control and currency conversion procedures;&#13;
*    financial charges;&#13;
*    revaluation of assets, liabilities and accounting for nonrecurring and&#13;
extraordinary items;&#13;
*    accounting policies and the preparation of monthly and annual (audited)&#13;
financial statements;&#13;
*    accounting of work in progress, stores and product stocks; and&#13;
*    annual auditing procedures.&#13;
10.   The review of Management Accounting and Reporting will focus on the&#13;
development of unit process costs, plant efficiencies and performance parameters, and the&#13;
implementation of a simple integrated zero-based budgetary and cost control system.&#13;
Recommendations for a more comprehensive MIS for the longer-term should be&#13;
formulated.&#13;
11.   A review should be undertaken of cost and financial, and accounting personnel's&#13;
experience and qualifications and specific recommendations made for strengthening the&#13;
Cost and Financial Departments, and the further training requirements for these&#13;
personnel.&#13;

Budget and Timing&#13;
12.  It is anticipated that the assignment will involve approximately 18 person-months&#13;
of international specialist input and that it can be completed within a budget of $750,000,&#13;
including the cost of computer hardware, standard modular accounting packages; the&#13;
remuneration of specialists and their travel, subsistence and miscellaneous costs; and the&#13;
cost of travel, subsistence and miscellaneous costs of overseas training for BJSC&#13;
personnel if necessary. The latter costs should be delineated and included in the&#13;
assignment description and assignment cost estimate. Consultant proposals should not be&#13;
bound by these person-month or cost estimates and proposals should be submitted on the&#13;
basis of analysis of work inputs required to complete the assignment and to address fully&#13;
the Scope of Services. It is anticipated that the assignment would commence in mid- to&#13;
late 1996.&#13;

ANNEX 4.7: MINISTRY OF ENERGY, GEOLOGY AND&#13;
MINING: TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENT&#13;
OUTLINE&#13;
Objective&#13;
1.    The objective of the technical assistance is to assist the Ministry of Energy,&#13;
Geology and Mines (MEGM) in the development of a medium-term strategy for the&#13;
further development of the sector, and MEGM's policy and regulatory role to best foster&#13;
that development. The technical assistance will include two main aspects:&#13;
(a)   A full review of the potential contribution of the Shive Ovoo Mine and&#13;
possible development of deposits at Tavan Tolgoi, considering, in&#13;
particular the economics of future operations (or in Tavan Tolgoi's case,&#13;
the technical and economic feasibility of future operations); and&#13;
(b)   Joint review and recommendation, together with Mongolian staff, of the&#13;
best future role for MEGM as the Government's policy-making and&#13;
regulatory agency for the coal sector, and step-by-step implementation&#13;
measures to attain that role.&#13;
2.    Description of the issues and scope of investigation are outlined below.&#13;
3.    Shive Ovoo. The new Shive Ovoo mine, only in its initial mine development&#13;
phase, is producing a low coal quality product that has been found unsuitable as a fuel for&#13;
power generation without the addition of high cost mazuut fuel oil. Mining is being&#13;
undertaken in what appears to be highly oxidized outcrop coal areas with high ash&#13;
contents. In addition, the hydrogeological regime has led to high in-pit moisture&#13;
contents, thus further reducing the quality of the coal product. No meaningful coal&#13;
quality or hydrogeological investigations have been made at Shive Ovoo. MEGM is&#13;
planning to retain a local drilling company to take core and bulk samples and will retain&#13;
specialists to supervise the drill program and subsequent international coal quality&#13;
laboratory investigations; assess thoroughly coal quality and hydrogeological issues; and&#13;
identify mine dewatering options/technologies that will facilitate formulation of a mine&#13;
development plan that produces a reliable and secure low-cost coal supply of acceptable&#13;
and reliable quality.&#13;
4.    Tavan Tolgoi. A feasibility study for the huge Tavan Tolgoi steam/coking coal&#13;
area was prepared in the Russian language, by the Leningrad Institute in the early 1990s,&#13;
following extensive drilling campaigns. Indications are that the coal area could sustain a&#13;
20 million tons per year operation, part of which would be high grade steam coal (7,000-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -                    ANNEX 4.7&#13;
8,000 kcal/kg) and part of which would be what the Russian specialists refer to as very&#13;
high-grade coking coal. The coal quality test parameters in the feasibility assessment&#13;
follow former Soviet Union standards are not capable of comparison with international&#13;
measures, particularly in relation to the coking coal grades. MEGM wish to retain&#13;
specialists to supervise and interpret coal quality drill and bulk samples; to translate and&#13;
undertake a preliminary review of the Leningrad Institute feasibility study; and, on a&#13;
preinvestment basis, prepare a preliminary comment on the potential development&#13;
options and likely order of magnitude costs and economics of mine development.&#13;
Economics would be viewed against various market scenarios including thermal coal&#13;
development for domestic consumption (including mine-mouth power generation) and&#13;
export, and coking coal export or local coke manufacture for export. It is recognized that&#13;
Tavan Tolgoi development would require considerable infrastructure development, which&#13;
would not be included at this stage in the review/study program. However, a perspective&#13;
of the potential free-on-rail costs of Tavan Tolgoi coal, and its likely domestic and&#13;
international competitiveness, would benefit MEGM medium-term energy sector&#13;
planning.&#13;
5.    Regulation and Policy-making. Based on a broad, joint review of (a) MEGM's&#13;
current responsibilities and activities in coal sector regulation and policy-making; (b) the&#13;
general regulatory framework for the sector established under the Minerals Law, and&#13;
current regulations concerning sector regulations and policy-making authorities; (c) the&#13;
current and future trends in the development of the coal market in Mongolia; and&#13;
(d) corporatization and privatization prospects and plans for coal mines other than the&#13;
Baganuur mine, Mongolian government staff, local consultants and selected international&#13;
experts will complete a joint review and provide recommendations to the Government on&#13;
the following:&#13;
(a)   Necessary changes in the existing legalUregulatory framework of the&#13;
Minerals Law and wide range of regulations and government decisions&#13;
goverming the detailed aspects of the Government's regulation of the coal&#13;
sector;&#13;
(b)   Necessary institutional changes, and adjustment in the responsibilities and&#13;
scope of work of units and staff in MEGM (and other relevant agencies),&#13;
in order to best implement MEGM's functions as the regulatory and&#13;
policy-making agency for the Government in the coal sector; and&#13;
(c)   A  step-by-step implementation plan to undertake the adjustments&#13;
recommended in (a) and (b) above.&#13;

PROGRAM&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    In March 1995, BJSC and the World Bank identified a number of environmental&#13;
issues for the Project Implementation Plan, and set out the terms of reference for an&#13;
Environmental Analysis Report (EAR), which would focus on these issues. The most&#13;
important issues were considered to be the review of local hydrology and potential impacts&#13;
of mine dewatering on Baganuur Lake and the reclamation mine spoils. In addition to the&#13;
standard environmental topics, an occupational health and safety action plan is also&#13;
included. The topics covered by the report are:&#13;
(a)   Environmental setting&#13;
(b)   Policy, legal and administrative framework&#13;
(c)   Analysis of environmental issues&#13;
(i)    Review of local hydrology (especially Baganuur Lake)&#13;
(ii)    Consultation with local population&#13;
(iii)    Review of ecological impact&#13;
(iv)    Reclamation and spoils management&#13;
(v)    Fugitive dust mitigation plan&#13;
(vi)    Contamination surveys&#13;
(vii)    Hazardous waste management&#13;
(viii)    Occupational health monitoring plan&#13;
(d)   Mitigation plan&#13;
(e)   Environmental management and training&#13;
(f)    Environmental monitoring plan&#13;
The sections below describe the Environmental Management Program  (EMP) to be&#13;
implemented under the project. A one-page summary outline of BJSC s Environmental&#13;
Mitigation Plan also is provided at the end of this Annex. Further details are provided in&#13;
the EAR.&#13;
Establishment of an Environmental Management Unit (EMU)&#13;
2.    BJSC will establish in-house capability to undertake the environmental management&#13;
activities detailed herein. There currently is no environmental management or monitoring&#13;
capability within BJSC, and there is a need for improvement in the occupational health and&#13;
safety organization. Training requirements will be aimed at development of skills in&#13;
environmental and safety management of mining operations, especially skills necessary to&#13;
implement the EMP. As detailed in Annex 4.5, training and development requirements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -                     ANNEX 4.11&#13;
will be achieved through a combination of technical assistance from foreign experts and&#13;
secondment of EMU staff to international mining operations or experts.&#13;
3.    To work in the EMU, the mine will employ a suitably qualified Environment and&#13;
Safety Manager (e.g., a graduate in engineering, environmental studies, chemistry, biology&#13;
or geography with at least 10 years' relevant experience), who will report to the Chief&#13;
Technical Engineer under the Deputy Director for Operations. He will be assisted by an&#13;
Environmental Technician, to undertake sampling and analysis, and an Occupational&#13;
Health and Safety Engineer with a team of inspectors from the existing Works Safety&#13;
Department. The Environment and Safety Manager will be responsible for further fine-&#13;
tuning and implementation of the EMP for the mine. He will also be responsible for liaison&#13;
with the regional and national environmental regulation authorities. He will be required to&#13;
maintain a general awareness of environmental issues and responsibilities in the mine's&#13;
management and work force.&#13;
4.    An additional function required at the mine is an Environmental Engineer for&#13;
reclamation, reporting to the Chief Technical Engineer. This person should work with the&#13;
engineers responsible for dump construction.  The environmental engineer will be&#13;
responsible for dump surface preparation, drainage, soils and vegetation reclamation. They&#13;
will also be responsible for the research program into reclamation described in Section 7 of&#13;
the EAR.&#13;
5.    A small environmental laboratory will be set up at the mine, which will be capable&#13;
of sample preparation, simple analysis with inexpensive instruments and chemical&#13;
techniques, and dust analysis. More complex analysis of water samples will be contracted&#13;
to either the local laboratory or to a laboratory in Ulaanbaatar; soil analysis (which will&#13;
occur in larger batches) will be contracted to a specialist laboratory in Ulaanbaatar (such as&#13;
the Institute of Geography).&#13;
Impact on Baganuur Lake&#13;
6.    During public consultation meetings, the local people expressed a consensus that&#13;
Baganuur Lake is a local religious, cultural and recreational resource, and should remain&#13;
undarnaged. The potential impact on water levels in Baganuur Lake from dewatering of the&#13;
mine, especially at Mountain Section 2, was identified as a concern for evaluation in the&#13;
environmental study. If the lake were a groundwater lake, with lake levels dependent on&#13;
depth of the surficial aquifer, mine dewatering operations could severely impact lake levels&#13;
by lowering the level of the surficial aquifer to the extent that the lake would disappear.&#13;
However, the EAR concluded that the lake is not dependent entirely, or even substantially,&#13;
on the groundwater, and dewatering operations do not pose a threat to its continued&#13;
existence.&#13;
7.    BJSC's mine development plan (20 years) involves advancing the present Mountain&#13;
Section 2 pit by about 150 meters towards the lake (a distance of 1.1 kilometers from the&#13;
lake), which will be completed by 2004. From 2005 until 2014 the mine advances to the&#13;
north, away from the lake. The line of dewatering wells required for the first stage (until&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -                     ANNEX 4.11&#13;
2004) was constructed recently and became operational during the summer of 1995. This&#13;
will be the closest that mining or dewatering operations come to the lake for the next 20&#13;
years.&#13;
8.    Taking into account data developed to date on the hydrology, hydrogeology, and&#13;
permafrost conditions of the area, hydrogeological analysis conducted for the EAR&#13;
concluded that the lake is not a groundwater lake, based on the following:&#13;
(a)   The groundwater level was measured in May 1995 about 9 meters below the&#13;
level of the bottom of the lake. The lake was bank full at the time this&#13;
measurement was made. In 1975, a Russian geological investigation&#13;
recorded the groundwater level at about the same level as the lake water.&#13;
(b)   A survey of water chemistry made during the environmental study indicates&#13;
composition of total dissolved solids (TDS) conductivity and specific ions to&#13;
be virtually matched in the Khujirt River upstream of the lake, in the lake,&#13;
and the Khujirt River downstream of the lake. The chemistry of the&#13;
groundwater demonstrates a TDS concentration threefold higher, with&#13;
corresponding increases in the other parameters. This indicates that water in&#13;
the lake is derived from surface water (a chemical match) and not&#13;
groundwater.&#13;
(c)   Sediments in the lake have been found to consist of interbedded clay and&#13;
sandy loam, at least 15 to 20 centimeters deep (limit of depth of sampling)&#13;
over the majority of the lake bottom, indicating that the sediments have the&#13;
ability to act as a barrier to seepage of water from the lake.&#13;
(d)   Permafrost exists in a mosaic along the north side of the lake, and is&#13;
continuous along the west side of the lake. The permafrost may also act as a&#13;
barrier to seepage of water from the lake.&#13;
9.    These indicate that the lake levels are independent of, or at most only partially&#13;
dependent on, groundwater level and are determined mainly by surface water inflows,&#13;
outflows, precipitation, evaporation and seepage through sediments. These preliminary&#13;
findings are strong indications that water levels in the lake would not be significantly&#13;
impacted by future dewatering operations of the mine over the current mine plan period of&#13;
20 years, should these operations cause groundwater levels in the area to subside.&#13;
10.   An ongoing monitoring and research program will be implemented, focusing on&#13;
detecting impacts of mining operations on groundwater and lake water levels, and&#13;
evaluating a contingency mitigation strategy. With intemational assistance, BJSC will&#13;
develop a more detailed groundwater model, including the relationship between the lake&#13;
and the groundwater, and the water balance of the lake. To enable this to be done, BJSC's&#13;
EMU will monitor hydrogeologic conditions around Mountain Section 2, Baganuur Lake&#13;
and the Khujirt River, upstream and downstream of the lake, along with rainfall and&#13;
evaporation. Sediments and strata in the base of the lake will be investigated when the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -                      ANNEX 4.11&#13;
surface of the lake is frozen and able to support a drill rig, in order to determine the ultimate&#13;
depth and composition of sediments below the lake, and seepage rate.  Permafrost&#13;
conditions will also be monitored.&#13;
11.   BJSC is committed to undertaking a mitigation program should ongoing evaluation&#13;
and monitoring indicate that water levels in Baganuur Lake have been impacted by mine&#13;
dewatering operations. Direct mitigation of impact could be achieved by directing&#13;
Mountain Section 2 dewatering discharge into the lake. The suitability of groundwater for&#13;
this purpose was also evaluated.  Current plans are to release Mountain Section 2&#13;
dewatering discharge into the Khujirt River downstream of Baganuur Lake. Extension of&#13;
the discharge pipeline to the lake would not be costly.&#13;
Reclamation&#13;
12.   Since mine operations began in 1978, pits and spoil dumps have occupied about&#13;
775.6 hectares of land. From this area only about 56,800 m3 of topsoil has been prestripped&#13;
and stockpiled, representing only about 4 percent of the total topsoil of this area. The mine&#13;
has not undertaken any reclamation of any of the spoil dumps. The spoil dump surfaces&#13;
consist of variable sandy and sandy-loam soils, with few stones or rocks. The spoil dumps&#13;
remain with steep-sided slopes (32 to 35 degrees), 30 to 40 meters high, extensively eroded&#13;
by wind and water.&#13;
13.   Future land use and selection of the afteruses takes into account factors such as&#13;
biological, climatic, soil, geological and hydrological conditions, vegetation prior to&#13;
mining, characteristics of dump materials, erosion potential, population of the area.&#13;
Reclamation will involve two basic stages:&#13;
(a)    Technical reclamation, involving filling of valleys between the tips, shaping&#13;
of slopes and covering with soil-forming materials.&#13;
(b)   Biological reclamation, involving amelioration of soils, establishment of&#13;
vegetation and five years' management to create a stable vegetation system.&#13;
14.   Over the 20-year mine plan, BJSC will progressively reclaim all spoils dumps in&#13;
accordance with a planned sequence. The reclamation plan was developed in conjunction&#13;
with the mine development plan, considering future spoil disposal by trucks. The areas to be&#13;
reclaimed, along with the timeframe, are shown on maps detailing: areas being filled; areas&#13;
where slopes are being recontoured; and areas under biological reclamnation.  These&#13;
reclamation plans, available in the project file, will be fine-tuned with ftrther technical&#13;
assistance under the project, and used to monitor reclamation progress during Bank project&#13;
supervision. Reclamation of the dumps will involve establishment of a combination of the&#13;
following three afteruses:&#13;
(a)   grassland for fodder and haymaking;&#13;
(b)   restoration of natural steppe vegetation for pasture; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-91-                       ANNEX 4.11&#13;
(c)   planting of trees.&#13;
15.   Until 1997, when the new bulldozers are obtained, reclamation activities will be&#13;
limited to filling between the spoil dumps. Revegetation experiments will be carried out in&#13;
1996-97, and in 1997 decisions on which areas will require subsoil, topsoil, and soil&#13;
amendments will be made. After soil amendments and preparations are made as required,&#13;
revegetation (biological reclamation) can begin in 1998.&#13;
16.   In general, the following landforms will be created:&#13;
(a)   valleys between dragline dumps will be filled by truck dumping, the spoil&#13;
being consolidated to reduce settlement;&#13;
(b)   all steep slopes will be graded (by regrading, filling or cutting back) by large&#13;
dozer and scraper (or dragline in places) to a maximum slope of 20 degrees&#13;
(1:2.7);&#13;
(c)   slopes will be no longer than 20 meters, with intermediate benches for&#13;
drainage and access as required; benches will drain back at an angle of&#13;
1 degree to a ditch; and&#13;
(d)   the tops of the dump areas will be graded to I degree to 3 degrees to shed&#13;
water; ponding will be avoided.&#13;
17.   Drainage by open grassed channels will be constructed on all benches and flat areas.&#13;
Where necessary, the channels will be lined or filled with stone to reduce scour and erosion.&#13;
Drainage water will be conveyed down slopes by rock-filled, rock-lined or concrete and&#13;
rock-lined channels. Discharge of the drainage system will be to ponds off the dumps,&#13;
which will seep to groundwater. After grading, the dump surface will be treated in one of&#13;
several ways depending on the availability of soil-forming materials, in preparation for the&#13;
establishment of vegetation covers.&#13;
18.   There has been very little investigation and research of the best techniques of&#13;
vegetation establishment, fertilizer amelioration and aftercare on mine spoils in Mongolia,&#13;
and none at Baganuur. The mine will therefore set up a research program in conjunction&#13;
with technical experts from the Mongolian Institute of Geography and Institute of Botany.&#13;
Technical assistance under the project includes an international expert in mine spoil&#13;
reclamation. This research program will last for at least five years. The results of the&#13;
research will be used to develop and progressively improve the technical and biological&#13;
reclamation of the spoil dumps at Baganuur and other Mongolian mines.&#13;
Fugitive Dust Mitigation&#13;
19.   The main sources of dust from the mining operation, and the mitigation measures&#13;
that will be employed to overcome them, are summarized in the table below. Continued&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -                                ANNEX 4.11&#13;
monitoring of respirable dust in the mine will check the effectiveness of the measures, and&#13;
any needs for more intensive efforts.&#13;
Dust sources                                           Mitigation&#13;
Haul roads, due to the passage of haul trucks as well as wind * Improvement of the unpaved haul road surfaces by&#13;
erosion. This is the principle source of dust.          grading and gravel surfaces.&#13;
* Watering regime to maintain a wet road surface.&#13;
* Avoiding overloading of trucks to prevent spillage of&#13;
coal/overburden onto road.&#13;
* Cleaning loose material from paved haul roads at least&#13;
twice per week.&#13;
Draglines and loading shovels-dust emitted as material  * Reducing drop heights, especially with draglines-this&#13;
drops from bucket onto spoil pile or into truck         will require some operator training.&#13;
Blasting-mainly due to stemming being blown out       * Use gravel instead of drill returns for stemming.&#13;
Drilling of blast holes with rotary drill instead of augers  * Dust extraction and filters on drilling rigs&#13;
Spoil dump erosion by wind                            * Reclamation will greatly reduce area of unvegetated&#13;
surface that can erode.&#13;
Coal handling-crushing, stockpiling, loading          * New coal handling plant will be constructed and fitted&#13;
with dust extraction equipment and water sprays.&#13;
* Fixed water/irrigation sprays around coal stocks and train&#13;
load-out.&#13;
Hazardous Waste Management&#13;
20.      The table below  summarizes the hazardous materials identified and their disposal&#13;
routes. In addition, appropriate storage facilities will be provided at the mine maintenance&#13;
depot for proper collection and storage of materials. These will be periodically inspected&#13;
and the waste streams audited by the mine's Environmental Manager.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Used tires and conveyor belt      Belt is reused. Some tires used for  Belt will continue to be reused; also&#13;
buffers; most are burned beneath  some tires. Remaining tires will be&#13;
machines during winter to warm fuel   recycled via nearby dealer.&#13;
tank and engine.&#13;
Metal wast-scrap iron and welding   Reused or dumped around site; some   Reused or recycled wherever possible;&#13;
residues                         tipped in landfill site.          unsuitable materials will go to landfill&#13;
site.&#13;
21.    For areas where spillage of fuels and oils is possible, (refueling depot, railway fuel&#13;
storage area, mine maintenance depot), the area will have an impervious base and spill&#13;
containment, with separate drainage and oil/water separators.&#13;
Occupational Health and Safety Action Plan&#13;
22.    Improvement  of workplace  exposure  conditions  by  increasing  exposure&#13;
monitoring frequency and improving supervision of the following remedial measures:&#13;
(a)     Review  and revision, where necessary, of BJSC's safety  policies and&#13;
procedures.&#13;
(b)     Introduction of an incentive and penalty system to enforce use of personnel&#13;
protective equipment, and monitor use during regular workplace inspections.&#13;
(c)     Provision of instruction in occupational health and safety, with written&#13;
materials and examinations.&#13;
(d)     Identification of hazard areas for supervision.&#13;
(e)     Systematization of workplace inspections, recordkeeping of requirements&#13;
for corrective actions and supervision of remedial actions.&#13;
(f)     Training for engineer/inspectors.&#13;
23.    Workplace improvements.   The health  and  safety  action  program  includes&#13;
modernization of workplace techniques, technology and tools. A fugitive dust mitigation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -                      ANNEX 4.11&#13;
plan has been prepared in conjunction with the health and safety action plan to control&#13;
fugitive dust emissions. The action plan includes installation of an exhaust fume ventilation&#13;
system in the automotive maintenance facility, and use of state of the art dust extraction and&#13;
dust suppression equipment in the new coal-handling system (to be included in the bid&#13;
specifications). The equipment to be procured under the project will have improved&#13;
operator protection from noise, shock and vibration.&#13;
24.   Personnel protective equipment. BJSC's occupational health and safety program&#13;
will provide personnel protective equipment to appropriate workers for the following&#13;
identified workplace exposures and hazards:  noise and vibration; traumatic injury;&#13;
electrocution; dust, toxic gas and smoke. This equipment includes: hard hats; respirators&#13;
appropriate for protection from dust or toxic gas; ear defenders; safety glasses; safety&#13;
harnesses; helmets with electrical field warning alarms; rubber gloves and boots. Gas&#13;
alarms (carbon monoxide, inflammable vapors) will be fitted in the maintenance shop.&#13;
25.   Training. Written materials and training will be provided on a scheduled basis,&#13;
encouraging independent study, with the incentive of "the right to work" for a year after&#13;
completion of the training.  Training courses include class work and qualification&#13;
examinations. A new occupational health program includes correspondence courses for&#13;
engineers and technicians. The training program will include a lecture series to be provided&#13;
by selected professionals to different groups of workers. A "training for trainers" course for&#13;
engineers and inspectors in methods of training and instruction includes study abroad.&#13;
Health and safety training records will be kept for all workers and staff.&#13;
26.   Designated areas and sign posting.  Areas of the mine will be designated&#13;
according to specific hazards and requirements to wear specific protective equipment.&#13;
These will include areas where the wearing of hard hats, ear defenders, dust filters, safety&#13;
harnesses or electrical field warnings will be compulsory. Such areas will be clearly sign&#13;
posted with visual symbols.&#13;
27.   Monitoring. A summary of the health and safety monitoring, the training and the&#13;
implementation of the action plan will be made available at each supervision visit by the&#13;
Bank. Monitoring of health and safety will include:&#13;
(a)    Accident records for all injuries and fatalities, including person-days lost,&#13;
causes, consequences, remedial action taken.&#13;
(b)   Records of all absence from work for industrial-related diseases, including&#13;
person-days lost, causes, consequences, remedial action taken.&#13;
(c)    Annual health screening for all workers, particularly for industrial-related&#13;
diseases (respiratory, hearing, spine/joints, sight). (There will also need to&#13;
be records for other nonindustrial health-related factors, such as smoking,&#13;
other illnesses.)&#13;

(d)   Occupational exposure screening and risk assessment by the Ministry of&#13;
Labor (Center for Investigation of Working Conditions) every five years.&#13;
(e)   Monthly monitoring (one daytime and one nighttime shift) of respirable dust&#13;
and noise in operator cabs of a representative selection of draglines, shovels,&#13;
loaders, haul trucks and dozers, and operators in the coal handling/loading&#13;
plant.&#13;
Environmental Monitoring&#13;
28.   BJSC will provide biannual summary environmental monitoring reports on the&#13;
monitoring program below to the Bank. These reports will include reference to any&#13;
deficiencies noted in dust control and reclamation progress, and details of the management&#13;
response in terms of remedial measures and their success. The reports will note samples&#13;
where enviromnental standards were exceeded and will give the remedial measures taken if&#13;
required. The full monitoring data will be appended to the reports.&#13;

ANNEX 4.12: SOCIAL IMPACT OF BJSC'S MANPOWER&#13;
REDUCTION PROGRAM&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The Baganuur Joint Stock Company (BJSC) plans to reduce its work force from&#13;
1,507 workers in October 1995 to about 907 workers in 2000, to improve the efficiency&#13;
of its operation.  Even following these reductions, BJSC's work force will be&#13;
substantially higher than the international norm for similar mechanized open-pit&#13;
operations. BJSC, experts from Mongolia's Institute of Administration and Management&#13;
Development and the IDA project team reviewed the company's manpower reduction&#13;
program and assessed potential social impacts on the local community, as BJSC is the&#13;
largest employer in the area. Social hardships arising from the reduction are expected to&#13;
be manageable, particularly with the adoption of several measures by BJSC, as discussed&#13;
below.&#13;
Principles of Implementation&#13;
2.    The Baganuur Joint Stock Company will apply the following principles in&#13;
implementation of its workforce reduction program during 1996-2000. These principles&#13;
were discussed and agreed by BJSC and IDA during project negotiations.&#13;
(a)   The importance of reducing the workforce at BJSC to levels closer to&#13;
international norms is affirmed, in order to improve the efficiency of&#13;
BJSC's operations.&#13;
(b)   BJSC will rely on voluntary workforce reduction (natural attrition) to the&#13;
extent possible, thereby minimizinng involuntary dismissals.&#13;
(c)   BJSC  will minimize involuntary dismissals through retraining of&#13;
redundant staff who are suitable and willing to transfer to other posts&#13;
within the company.&#13;
(d)   BJSC will carefully assess employee skills, family circumstances and&#13;
gender mix before making involuntary dismissals.&#13;
(e)   BJSC will avoid, to the maximum extent possible, dismissals that would&#13;
lead to a high risk of family poverty.&#13;
(f)   There will be no discrimination against women in implementation of the&#13;
BJSC workforce reduction program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -                    ANNEX 4.12&#13;
(g)   BJSC will work closely with local government agencies, including the&#13;
local labor exchange, and will seek to link dismissed workers to other&#13;
employment and social welfare programs, including programs funded by&#13;
international donors.&#13;
Background&#13;
3.    Baganuur District. Baganuur was established in 1978. Although 125 miles&#13;
from urban Ulaanbaatar, Baganuur is administered as part of Ulaanbaatar. It comprises&#13;
the mine, a town (3,200 households) and a ger village (600 households). An expanding&#13;
ger district to the north of the town has 280 households. The population is just over&#13;
17,000 and originates from all parts of Mongolia. Typical family size is four to five&#13;
persons, including three children. Land area totals 21 000 hectares. An abandoned&#13;
Soviet military base of 900 hectares lies to the north, and is home to 40 households.&#13;
4.    Mongolian-Soviet corporations established Baganuur. The plan was for Baganuur&#13;
to expand, relieving pressures on the physical and social infrastructure of Ulaanbaatar.&#13;
Soviet construction enterprises built 58 apartment blocks but work was halted in 1992.&#13;
Baganuur has a limited number of industries that service the population's needs, but the&#13;
mine is by far the largest enterprise. Table I shows the breakdown of employment for the&#13;
district. Of an estimated labor force of 8,238 in October 1995, about 46 percent are&#13;
employed in enterprises and public service. BJSC employs 1,507 persons (18 percent of&#13;
the labor force), comprised of about 380 women and 1,127 men. The next largest&#13;
employer is the state administration (1,065 workers, or 13 percent), public organizations&#13;
and service (449 persons, or 5 percent), an electrical cables communications enterprise&#13;
(244 workers) and the town's heating plant (197 workers). In addition, an estimated&#13;
2,150 persons, or 26 percent of the labor force, are employed in family undertakings,&#13;
primarily herding. Some 240 persons are employed as traders, kiosk vendors or as&#13;
various types of entrepreneurs.&#13;
5.    Unemployment, as calculated by the local labor exchange office, stands at 11.5&#13;
percent of the labor force. Of the 945 registered unemployed, 73 percent are women, 27&#13;
percent are without qualification, and 20 percent are below age 25. Including persons&#13;
considered unemployed but who are not actively searching for employment or have&#13;
otherwise not registered with the labor office, the total number of unemployed may be&#13;
over 2,000, or about 25 percent of the labor force. Since unemployment compensation&#13;
benefit is provided for a maximum of only five months, many of these jobless people,&#13;
however, undertake some form of self-employment. Apparently, 52 percent are partially&#13;
occupied in retailing to earn a living. Earnings from street trading are estimated by local&#13;
experts at Tg 19,500/month, just about enough to support a family. About 45 percent of&#13;
unemployed persons without unemployment compensation have household earnings&#13;
below Tg 6,400/month (the level of the minimum wage). There are 173 households (836&#13;
persons) with incomes below the official poverty line of Tg 200/month..&#13;

6.     Unemployment Compensation.  Currently, under the Labor Law  of 1991, a&#13;
redundant employee who is laid off by an enterprise is entitled to receive one month's&#13;
salary (average of the previous three months' earnings) as compensation for dismissal.&#13;
The enterprise must also pay the local labor exchange office a sum equivalent to three&#13;
months' earnings. The unemployed person may receive from the labor office a benefit&#13;
equal to the minimum living standard (Tg 4,200/month) for up to four months while&#13;
looking for work. At present, the local labor office provides its clients with a list of&#13;
vacant jobs and employers, but does not have capabilities to provide retraining.&#13;
7.      With  the  recent enactment of new   social safety  net reforms, however,&#13;
unemployment compensation will improve beginning in 1997. Starting January 1995,&#13;
Mongolia established a Social Fund by means of social insurance. Employers and&#13;
employees contribute to the Social Fund at 23 percent and 16 percent of earnings,&#13;
respectively. Beginning in 1997, any employee with 24 months of contributions will&#13;
receive unemployment compensation equal to 45 percent of their average salary of the&#13;
previous three months. If an unemployed person has worked 15 years, the benefit will be&#13;
71 percent of the previous salary. Salaries in Mongolia tend to be between Tg 15,000 to&#13;
Tg 30,000/month, with the average (August 1995) being Tg 24,400/month, according to&#13;
the State Statistical Office. Unemployment compensation benefit is set at a very low rate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-101-                      ANNEX 4.12&#13;
of Tg 4,200/month in towns and Tg 3,700/month in rural areas, under the government's&#13;
regulations within the terms of the Labor Law. In practice, as may have been the case in&#13;
Baganuur, the labor exchange has paid the unemployed worker a sum based upon his or&#13;
her previous salary, provided that this has been made over by the former employer. In&#13;
addition, beginning in 1997, a better-organized and funded system for vocational training&#13;
of unemployed persons is expected to be put in place.&#13;
8.    Retirement pensions. The retirement age for women is at 55 years and for men it&#13;
is 60 years. Up to 1995, retirees from state enterprises and the administration received a&#13;
pension from the state budget. Inflation has eroded the value of many pensions, despite&#13;
indexation, and thus people were reportedly living on sums between Tg 4,500 to&#13;
Tg 12,000/month. Those who had insufficient years of state service or who had not&#13;
worked in state enterprises received a minimal pension of Tg 2,600/month. In Baganuur,&#13;
around 35 percent of poor households under official definitions are old-age pensioners.&#13;
Beginning in 1998, however, improved retirement pensions will be paid out of the Social&#13;
Fund. To obtain a full pension, contributions must have been made for 20 years at 9.5&#13;
percent of earnings. The basic pension will be (from 1998) equal to 45 percent of the&#13;
average of the best five years of earnings, with an enhancement of 1.5 percent for each&#13;
year of service beyond 20 for which contributions have been made. Between 1995 and&#13;
1998 retirees obtain a pension under the terms of the Social Security Law but on the basis&#13;
of years of service only. The discrepancy between the size of pension before and after&#13;
1995 is being rectified by a phased increase in very low pensions. It is important for&#13;
employees to accumulate 20 years service for pension purposes.&#13;
BJSC's Manpower Reduction Program&#13;
9.    BJSC launched its program of work force reduction for 1995-2000 in July 1995.&#13;
The General Director announced the following:&#13;
(a)   There will be no external recruitment to vacant positions;&#13;
(b)   Anyone who wishes to leave the company may go freely;&#13;
(c)   Retraining will be provided to redundant staff who are suitable and willing&#13;
to transfer to another post within the company;&#13;
(d)   The company wishes to retrain hard working, responsible and productive&#13;
personnel adequate to the needs of a market economy;&#13;
(e)   The company will apply the provision of the Labor Law for all dismissal&#13;
cases.&#13;
10.   BJSC's plans for work force reduction between October 1995 and 2000 are&#13;
provided in Table 2. The largest cuts are in departments involved with the railway&#13;
overburden removal operation or its maintenance, due to the replacement of the rail&#13;
system by mobile equipment under the proposed project. Employees in the former&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102 -                             ANNEX 4.12&#13;
railroad and prestripping section are to be reduced by 278. Cuts will be made in the&#13;
transportation and mining equipment maintenance sections (257), reflecting the phasing&#13;
out of obsolete equipment, and adoption of revised operations and maintenance&#13;
procedures. There will be job losses also in the power supply and auxiliary equipment&#13;
sections, and smaller reductions in the production, processing and technical sections.&#13;
Management functions (corporate strategy and planning, finance, personnel,&#13;
procurement) will be strengthened. The social support department is due to be divested&#13;
under a privatization program in 1998.&#13;

11.    BJSC plans to minimize dismissals by phasing manpower reduction in line with&#13;
voluntary  worker departures.   Together with  the  Institute  of Administration  and&#13;
Management Development, the company has estimated that an average 176 staff leave the&#13;
company each year voluntarily, for military service or due to disability. In addition, there&#13;
are a limited number of retirements (10 a year), and, recently, a large number of&#13;
dismissals for disciplinary offenses (100 a year). However, there are phasing and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-103 -                        ANNEX 4.12&#13;
"bunching" difficulties. The employees who lose their jobs do so at particular points&#13;
when, for instance, the overburden rail removal system becomes obsolete at end-1996,&#13;
while the normal attrition of the work force is spread more evenly and throughout BJSC&#13;
departments. Furthermore, the suitability of employees for internal redeployment varies&#13;
and cannot in every case be solved through retraining. As a result, BJSC expects to be&#13;
forced to release about 150 employees involuntarily for economic reasons during 1995-&#13;
2000 onto the labor market, of whom 22 were dismissed in September 1995.' This can be&#13;
managed without undue social hardship.&#13;
Mitigation of Social Impacts&#13;
12.   Local development.  Local economic development will enable most of the&#13;
displaced workers to be absorbed within the local labor market. The district's economy is&#13;
expected to continue to be largely dominated by the mine, existing unemployment is&#13;
estimated at about 25 percent, and overall new employment prospects are not particularly&#13;
good. Yet, several factors point towards increased economic opportunity in the area,&#13;
primarily in services and trade. The district also is considered relatively affluent, and its&#13;
situation close to Ulaanbaatar makes it relatively attractive. Recently, as many as 1,000&#13;
new incomers per year have been reported.&#13;
13.   Baganuur is well positioned to play an increasing role as a market center. An&#13;
open market operates every Sunday, attracting buyers and sellers from eastern aimags,&#13;
and the city government has decided to organize a new, broader wholesale market. In&#13;
addition to the existing rail link, construction of a road to more conveniently link&#13;
Ulaanbaatar with Baganuur will be completed in 1997, funded in part with Japanese&#13;
Government assistance, and plans have been made to continue the highway to Choibalsan&#13;
by 2008. The city also owns several empty or unfinished buildings connected to the&#13;
energy and water/sewerage network, dating back to the previous construction venture&#13;
with the Russians, which can be adapted for use by small and medium enterprises. New&#13;
businesses are being established.  The private sector includes 20 companies, 17&#13;
partnerships and 138 sole proprietorships. About 40 percent of the private businesses are&#13;
involved in food production/distribution or retailing. The remainder of the partnerships&#13;
and sole proprietorships are mostly occupied with repairs, laundry and sewing. A&#13;
constraint in the development of small and medium enterprises, however, is a shortage of&#13;
capital for startup. In late 1995, commercial banks were charging interest rates of 6&#13;
percent per month.&#13;
After subtracting normal attrition, retirements, and disciplinary dismissals, involuntary job losses for&#13;
economic reasons total 118 over the six-year period. Of these, about 54 workers are in social support,&#13;
which will be privatized, but will remain, in principle, employed in their current capacity. On the other&#13;
hand, the bunching of layoffs, and difficulties in fully matching redundant staff to emerging vacancies&#13;
in other departments, mean that involuntary dismissals entering the labor market will be significantly&#13;
higher than total net local job loss.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-104 -                     ANNEX 4.12&#13;
14.   BJSC will continue to work together with the local government to foster small&#13;
and medium enterprise growth and other community initiatives that can provide&#13;
employment opportunity for displaced workers.  Considerable international donor&#13;
assistance is currently available to support well-organized initiatives in Mongolia, which&#13;
Baganuur can take advantage of. In addition to employment promotion and local&#13;
development initiatives fostered under the government's poverty alleviation program,&#13;
some of these activities include: (a) the European Union's (EU) TACIS program, which,&#13;
with the United Nations Development Programme, provides assistance to strengthen the&#13;
Mongolian Development Agency's technical assistance support for new small and&#13;
medium enterprises; (b) a US Revolving Fund, providing loans to small export-earning,&#13;
import-substituting or employment-generation schemes; (c) ADB's proposed credit lines&#13;
(Employment Generation II) to microenterprises in agriculture and agroindustries; and&#13;
(d) a new ADB agroprocessing, storage and distribution project, of which 50 percent&#13;
would be allocated as credits for small and medium enterprises. Additional support for&#13;
small and medium enterprises may also be provided from the European Community&#13;
Investment Partnership.&#13;
15.   BJSC and the local government are reviewing options where supplies needed by&#13;
the mine could be produced locally, including a new sewing factory (to provide overalls&#13;
for mine workers); a fast food outlet (for mine employees); a powdered milk plant (to&#13;
provide milk products during the winter); a car/vehicle maintenance depot; expansion of a&#13;
pig breeding farm; and vegetable growing (market gardening).&#13;
16.   Social Sensitivity in Dismissals. BJSC is undertaking its manpower reduction&#13;
program in a planned way for the first time and under difficult financial circumstances.&#13;
The company shows sympathy toward the social issues of future displaced workers that&#13;
are planned to be dismissed, but it also needs to strike a balance between this issue and its&#13;
goal to become a financially sustainable, commercial and market-oriented concern. To&#13;
achieve this, the company must continue, and further improve, its liaison with the labor&#13;
unemployment office, local government and trade unions. To the extent possible, BJSC&#13;
must adopt a multidimensional approach to dismissals, to take account not just its own&#13;
future needs but those of dismissed employees.  Employee skills and family&#13;
circumstances will be assessed before involuntary dismissal for economic reasons. In&#13;
some cases, BJSC may be able to better prepare some displaced workers for outside work&#13;
through retraining. Dismissals leading to a high risk of family poverty will be avoided&#13;
where possible, such as dismissal of certain disabled workers, dismissals of parents in&#13;
households lacking another wage earner, or dismissal of two breadwinners from the same&#13;
household. There will be no discrimination against women.&#13;
17.   The Baganuur labor exchange office should seek technical assistance from the&#13;
EU's TACIS project (through the Ministry of Labor) to reinforce employment services.&#13;
This project assists labor exchanges to better communicate with each other, pool&#13;
resources, and improve client training programs. BJSC's existing training center could&#13;
also provide support in a collaborative effort.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-105 -                     ANNEX 4.12&#13;
18.   Safety Net. BJSC and the district government can ensure that any displaced&#13;
workers who might, for whatever reason, continue to be unable to find employment and&#13;
fall into poverty can be assisted through the government's donor-assisted poverty&#13;
alleviation programs. The IDA and ADB-supported poverty alleviation program provides&#13;
additional employment promotion and local development support, women's development&#13;
financing, and social assistance funds, targeted at assisting the most poor. Baganuur&#13;
District is a participant in the program, eligible for support. Some support remains&#13;
available from the Red Cross and other charities. Local government programs include&#13;
grants for the very poor for heating requirements and low-interest lows for poor families&#13;
to purchase domestic animals.&#13;
Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
19.  IDA will continue to monitor the progress and social impact of BJSC's work force&#13;
reduction program through the duration of the project. In its biannual project status&#13;
reports to IDA, BJSC will include reports on (a) the status of mine employment, (b) the&#13;
details of worker dismissals (including department origin, worker social circumstances,&#13;
and type of dismissal-e.g., voluntary, retirement, disciplinary, or involuntary for&#13;
economic reasons); (c) status of coordination with the labor exchange office, trade union,&#13;
and local government; (d) status of small and medium enterprise development and other&#13;
community initiatives yielding employment growth; and (e) current circumstances of&#13;
workers involuntarily dismissed for economic reasons during 1995-2000 and remaining&#13;
in Baganuur (requiring periodic survey work).&#13;

-107 -                     ANNEX 5.1&#13;
ANNEX 5.1: ASSUMPTIONS FOR BJSC'S FINANCIAL&#13;
PROJECTIONS, 1994-2014&#13;
A. INCOME STATEMENT: TABLE 1&#13;
1.    Production. The buildup in production of salable coal is estimated to be 3.3 and&#13;
3.8 million tons in 1996 and 1997, respectively, and continuing thereafter at a rate of 4.0&#13;
million tons per year. A stripping ratio of 3.63 bcm of overburden per ton of coal has&#13;
been estimated from the regional geology and used throughout the planning horizon.&#13;
2.    Operating Costs. Variable hourly operating costs by element (labor, electricity,&#13;
spare parts, explosives, diesel fuel, etc.) were developed for each major item of&#13;
equipment. Costs for new equipment was based on operating experience in the United&#13;
States (Cost Reference Guide for Construction Equipment) and adjusted for Mongolian&#13;
conditions. Hourly operating costs for the existing Russian equipment was developed&#13;
from historical costs (1994) data collected by BJSC. A provision for the major overhauls&#13;
of new equipment was added to the unit operating costs. These together with the&#13;
operating hours required by the long-range mine plan were used to derive the detailed&#13;
total operating costs for each mine plan (i.e., the mine without the project and with the&#13;
project). Fixed costs (including administrative overheads) were estimated from historic&#13;
costs for each of the seven operating divisions of the mine. All costs were developed in&#13;
June 1995 tugriks at the average 1995 exchange rate of Tg 450 = $1. A summary of these&#13;
costs are contained in the report prepared by Morrison and Knudsen in the project file.&#13;
3.    Labor Complement. In line with the requirements of the mine plan, it was&#13;
assumed that the authorized labor strength will progressively be reduced from 1,640 in&#13;
1994 to 907 in 2000.&#13;
4.    Capital Costs. Capital costs were developed on the basis of a detailed schedule&#13;
of capital equipment requirements and a replacement program based on the estimated&#13;
useful life of each item. A depreciation schedule was developed on the basis of the&#13;
estimate of useful life and not necessarily on the rates currently proscribed by MOF.&#13;
5.    Cost Escalation. Costs were initially converted to US dollars and then increased&#13;
annually by the average MUV rate of 2.4 percent.&#13;
6.    Coal Price. Coal is sold FOB mine site (rail freight and commercial tax are,&#13;
however, paid by BJSC and then recovered from major consumers). The coal price is&#13;
administered by GOM and is based on a calorific value of 3,360 kcal/kg and on the&#13;
contractual price in US dollar terms received in 1995 of $5.60/ton. The 1995 price in&#13;
dollar terms has been progressively increased in real terms by 34 percent over the period&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-108 -                     ANNEX 5.1&#13;
1996-2000 and then adjusted annually in line with international inflation at a rate of 2.4&#13;
percent a year.&#13;
7.    Taxation. A tax rate of 40 percent of profits is used after providing for the&#13;
revaluation of assets and revised depreciation schedule. The revised depreciation charge&#13;
is phased in over the period 1996-97 at the rate of 50 and 75 percent, respectively, and&#13;
thereafter is fully deductible for tax purposes. Although unredeemed losses are not&#13;
brought forward, all costs directly related to the production of mining income are&#13;
regarded as deductible for tax purposes (including those previously recognized as social&#13;
costs). A tax-deductible royalty of 3 percent has been applied.&#13;
8.    Rate of Interest. The onlending rate of interest on IDA was agreed by MOF and&#13;
BJSC. This was fixed at a commercial rate of 4.2 percent in US dollar terms with a terrn&#13;
of 25 years, including a period of grace of 8 years. OECF funds are assumed to be lent&#13;
direct to BJSC at 3.2 percent repayable over 20 years, with a grace period of 10 years.&#13;
BJSC bears the full foreign exchange risk.&#13;
9.    Interest During Construction. Since this project is an extension of an existing&#13;
and ongoing operation and is designed to improve operational efficiencies, no interest&#13;
during construction has been explicitly provided nor has it been capitalized. From the&#13;
commencement of the project, interest on outside borrowings have being expensed in the&#13;
year they that are accrued.&#13;
10.   Dividend Distribution. Since the coal price increase represents the minimum&#13;
that is required to ensure a break-even position within five years and longer-term&#13;
financial viability and self-sufficiency, no distribution of dividends has been assumed and&#13;
all surplus cash has been retained in the company and reflected under short-term&#13;
investments.&#13;
B. BALANCE SHEET: TABLE 3&#13;
11.   Restatement of Accounts.  The Mongolian accounts as at end-1994 were&#13;
adjusted for hyperinflation by an international firm of chartered accountants substantially&#13;
in accordance with International Accounting Standards and restated in US dollars. This&#13;
provided the opening balance sheet for all the projections. Their report and extensive&#13;
notes to the accounts are contained in the project file.&#13;
12.   Finished Product. Coal stocks at the mine rail head are assumed to remain&#13;
constant at two weeks of production.&#13;
13.   Stores and Supplies. Inventories of stores and supplies are assumed to decrease&#13;
progressively from 418 days to 62 days' consumption of spare parts, diesel and&#13;
explosives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-109 -                     ANNEX 5.1&#13;
14.   Accounts Receivable.   Debtors are expected to remain current for future&#13;
deliveries of coal and are assumed to progressively reduce their arrears from 184 days in&#13;
1994 to 30 days over the period to 2000.&#13;
15.   Accounts Payable. BJSC's trade creditors are expected to remain constant at 30&#13;
days.&#13;
16.   Prepayments. It is assumed that, with IDA support, the necessity of having to&#13;
make advance payments for supplies will cease beyond 1995.&#13;
17.   Other Creditors. All amounts owing to government in respect of tax assessment&#13;
at end-1994 are settled in full in 1995 (including the set-off arranged by MOF in May&#13;
1995) and will thereafter be maintained at 30 days.&#13;
18.   Operating Cash. Operating cash at hand and in the bank is assumed to increase&#13;
from a minimal level to 30 days of the wage, heating and electricity charge.&#13;
19.   Depreciation of Obsolete Equipment and Facilities. The undepreciated value&#13;
of the rail haulage system and the existing coal-handling plant are written off against&#13;
fixed assets and expensed in 1996 and 1997 as they are decommissioned and taken out of&#13;
service.&#13;

ANNEX 5.2: BAGANUUR COAL PRICE ADJUSTMENT&#13;
MECHANISM&#13;
1.    At present the coal price in Mongolia (i.e., Tug 2,500/ton) is below both the&#13;
import price parity and the average incremental costs of coal production, and is&#13;
insufficient to enable Baganuur to cover its cost of sales, service potential borrowings and&#13;
support a minimum capital expenditure program. A price increase with regular reviews is&#13;
required under the IDA credit for Baganuur to become economically viable and&#13;
financially self sufficient. This price, although limited by the price of imported coal,&#13;
should provide for:&#13;
(a)   A base price denominated in local currency, which should be sufficient to&#13;
enable Baganuur to: (i) cover all its direct and indirect operating costs&#13;
including, depreciation on revalued assets, allowable social costs and other&#13;
costs related to the production of coal in a remote area; (ii) service its debt;&#13;
and (iii) provide for a reasonable after-tax return on the funds employed by&#13;
the company. This base price should be derived on the basis of a life-of-&#13;
mine financial projection and updated ever two to three years or as&#13;
frequently as circumstances dictate. On present indications a rational&#13;
base price for Baganuur is estimated at about $7.50 per ton, in 1995 US&#13;
dollar terms, or about 34 percent above the actual 1995 level.&#13;
(b)   A  mandatory biannual adjustment to the base price to allow  for&#13;
depreciation of the tugrik, the general level of international inflation and&#13;
the quality of coal delivered. This adjustment should therefor comprise&#13;
the following elements:  (i) since roughly 85 percent of Baganuur's&#13;
operating costs and all of its debt servicing are derived in foreign currency,&#13;
it is essential to adjust the base price to account for changes in the US&#13;
dollar exchange rate for the period under review compared to the exchange&#13;
rate at the time when the base price was determined; (ii) an internationally&#13;
recognized index reflecting the increase in the average price of Baganuur's&#13;
inputs (e.g., The Manufacturing Unit Value index published by the World&#13;
Bank)'; and (iii) the ratio of the actual calorific value of each delivery and&#13;
the base value of 3,360 kcal/kg; and&#13;
(c)   The ability of Baganuur's customer base to absorb significant price&#13;
increases. These increases may be phased in over a period to provide time&#13;
The anticipated average MUV for the period 1995 to 2010 is 2.4 percent per year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-114-                       ANNEX 5.2&#13;
for CES to adjust to the revised price structure without undue disruption.&#13;
To achieve this, a price rebate of a maximum of 20 percent should be&#13;
applied in the first year and there after progressively reduced.&#13;
2.    In summary, a pricing formula, automatically adjusted every six months, can be&#13;
determined along the following lines:&#13;
Pricep = Base Price * (Ex Ratep /Ex RateB) * (1+infjt * (cal val/3,360) . (l+Reb)&#13;
Where Ex Ratep       = $ exchange rate in month prior to the pricing period&#13;
Ex RateB      = $ exchange rate in the base period&#13;
inf           = International inflation expressed as a percentage&#13;
t             = Time from the base period in years&#13;
cal val       = Calorific value of coal delivered&#13;
Reb           = Rebate for the relevant year expressed as a percentage.&#13;
[Example: Price1996 = 3375 * 614/450 * 1.024 *3,360 / 3,360 . 1.2 = Tg 3937/toc ($6.42/ton) ]&#13;

-115 -                      ANNEX 6.1&#13;
ANNEX 6.1: PROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    Economic analysis for the project included the preparation of a detailed mine plan&#13;
and associated costs for both the "without project" and "with project" case for the period&#13;
1995-2014 and a comparison of a variety of scenarios for the rehabilitation of BJSC and&#13;
least-cost restoration of coal production. Because of hyperinflation, costs were adjusted&#13;
in accordance with IAS 29 and thereafter estimated in US dollars in 1995 terms. All&#13;
projections were made in US dollars.&#13;
2.    All economic analysis was conducted on the basis of border prices and a discount&#13;
rate of 12 percent in real terms. Shadow prices used are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Coal. The shadow price for Baganuur's coal of $7.8/ton, ex-mine, was&#13;
based on parity with coal that could be imported from the Kuzbass coal&#13;
basin in Russia.  A minimum  import price capacity of $6.2/ton of&#13;
6,000 kcal/kg coal equivalent (tce) was estimated, based on the short-run&#13;
marginal production cost at the Kuzbass Basin, where there is a large&#13;
surplus capacity. Transport costs by rail from Kuznetsk to Ulaanbaatar&#13;
(1,300 km), coal-handling fees and adjustment for Baganuur's low&#13;
calorific value of 3,300 kcal/kg were added in.&#13;
(b)   Operating costs. With the exception of labor, power, and diesel, all costs&#13;
were shadow priced at the standard conversion factor of 0.9.&#13;
(c)   Other costs. The conversion factors used for labor, power and diesel were&#13;
1.4, 2.0 and 1.0, respectively.&#13;
3.    Incremental production of coal was estimated to increase from 1.3 million ton in&#13;
1997 to 1.5 million in 1998 and beyond.&#13;
4.    Inventory requirements were calculated on the basis of 62 days of incremental&#13;
consumption of explosives, spare parts and diesel.&#13;
5.    The incremental cost-benefit stream was derived from the difference between the&#13;
with- and without-project case, after netting out all duties and taxes, for the period 1997-&#13;
2014 and summarized in Table 1.&#13;

            Mongolia - Coal Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objective of the Coal Project
            is to reverse the decline in Mongolia's coal production
            by increasing sustainable production levels at the Baganuur
            mine to 4 million tons per year. Additional, associated
            objectives are for Baganuur Joint Stock Company (BJSC) to:
            1) develop financial self-sufficiency; 2) increase equipment
            productivity and improve efficiency; 3) operate as an
            independent commercial company; and 4) operate in an
            environmentally acceptable manner over the long term. The
            principal components of the project are: 1) procurement and
            commissioning of equipment to rehabilitate the Baganuur coal
            mine operation; 2) procurement and turnkey installation and
            commissioning of equipment for a coal-handling plant
            consisting of crusher, linear stacker, underground reclaimer
            and train-loader; and 3) technical assistance to BJSC
            including in-country and overseas training to: (a) improve
            mine operations and mine supervision practices and
            procedures; (b) develop mine maintenance management and
            materials management systems; (c) upgrade financial and cost
            accounting/management information systems; and (d) improve
            environmental management capabilities.
