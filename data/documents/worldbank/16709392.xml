The Karnataka Urban Water Sector Improvement Project&#13;
&#13;
24x7 Water Supply is Achievable&#13;
Pilot projects in three cities of Karnataka have shown that a well-operated water supply system can&#13;
deliver water supply 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in Indian cities, bringing an affordable,&#13;
reliable service to urban households including the poorest.&#13;
&amp;#12;        Poor water service levels have led to consumers adopting expensive&#13;
        coping strategies that include installing underground storage tanks&#13;
        and household filters. Those without a connection have to queue at&#13;
        standpostsâ&#128;&#148;with the additional burden of often not knowing to the&#13;
        nearest day when water may come.&#13;

  The project was rolled out in five select zones in three cities (Belgaum, Gulbarga, and the twin cities of Hubli-Dharwad) in northern Karnataka, with a total population of around 2 million people. The demonstration&#13;
zones were selected such that they represent the socioeconomic mix of the city, with at least 10 percent of the city connections. The main objective was to prove that it is possible to deliver 24x7 continuous,&#13;
clean water in India, as well as to show that such an approach could work across a range of topographies and in a variety of housing areas and types.&#13;

  The Service Level Benchmarking (SLB) Program was initiated by the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) in 2006, with the introduction of a Handbook for defining a common minimum benchmarking&#13;
framework of 28 standard performance parameters for water supply, wastewater management, storm water drainage, and solid waste management services. To encourage and facilitate the adoption of&#13;
the SLB framework and test its applicability on the ground, the MoUD supported its implementation in 28 pilot cities across the country for undertaking a performance monitoring based on these indicators.&#13;

&#13;
Scope and structure&#13;
The OCâ&#128;&#153;s role was to deliver 24x7 water through a structured management and engineering reform plan and&#13;
establish a customer billing center in the demonstration zones. Revenue for the services was to be collected by&#13;
the municipal corporations based on tariffs set by urban local bodies using Government of Karnataka guidelines.&#13;
Community participation was envisaged through nongovernmental organizations, along with provision for appropriate&#13;
feedback mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
The 183-week contract was divided into three phases:&#13;
&#13;
(A)	 Preparation of an Investment Plan for achieving the performance targets, which included development of a&#13;
     hydraulic model for the system, preparation of a rehabilitation plan, and estimating the cost of works involved.&#13;
(B)	 Implementation of the Investment Plan including preparation of contract documents, procurement, selection of&#13;
     subcontractors and rehabilitation of the system. Phases A and B were expected to be completed within&#13;
     79 weeks.&#13;
(C)	 Operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of the rehabilitated 24x7 system for 104 weeks.&#13;
&#13;
Remuneration&#13;
The OCâ&#128;&#153;s remuneration, separate from the capital expenditure requirement, was divided into two parts. â&#128;&#152;Fixed&#13;
remunerationâ&#128;&#153; was equal to 60 percent of the total, to be paid to the OC in 15 equal quarterly installments from the&#13;
start of the contract term until the end of the 42nd month. â&#128;&#152;Performance remunerationâ&#128;&#153; was to be paid to the OC in&#13;
installments through the O&amp;M period based on achievement of performance targets (see Box 5). Ten percent of all&#13;
payments (both fixed and performance) was to be retained as retention money, to be released on the successful&#13;
completion of the contract. The contract provided for a â&#128;&#152;capital efficiency bonusâ&#128;&#153; linked to savings in capital&#13;
expenditure with 3.75 percent of the OC remuneration for savings up to 25 percent, and 10 percent of additional&#13;

  In this jointing technique, the ends of the pipes to be connected are cut square to each other, cleaned and held in a rigid clamp with&#13;
a specified force against a heated plate, which is removed when the plastic has reached the correct temperature and begun to melt.&#13;
The two pipes are then brought together, again with a specified force, with the joint forming as the plastic cools. The end result should&#13;
be a joint which is stronger than the pipe itself.&#13;

  the people were forced to use water pumps to lift the water. Since the water         at the high amount of water they&#13;
  is now available as high as 20 feet, it has eradicated the usage of water            were using and therefore by their&#13;
  pumps, thus saving electricity. We like 24x7 water and we use water as much          monthly bills, successfully lobbied for&#13;
  as we can and pay as per our usage. However, I would like to ask for much            a reduction in the new tariff structure.&#13;

Box 9: Social Intermediation and Communications: Bridging the gap&#13;
&#13;
In 2005, a World Bank supervision mission for KUWASIP advised the KUIDFC to set up appropriate mechanisms to plan&#13;
and implement communication activities under the project. This was seen as a vital element for the success of the project.&#13;
Consequently, in September 2005, the Empowered Committee of the Government of Karnataka, the highest level of&#13;
decision-making authority for Externally Assisted Projects (EAPs) such as the KUWASIP, passed a decision to set up a&#13;
Social Intermediation and Communication Strategy (SICS) Cell within the KUIDFC for this purpose.&#13;
&#13;
The SICS Cell was mandated to develop the communications strategy and implement it for the project. It was decided that&#13;
the Cell would have three key professional staff members and NGOs who would be appointed in the three pilot towns to&#13;
undertake communication activities at the local, town level. A budget of Rs. 2 crore (USD$0.44 million) was allocated to the&#13;
Cell for communication activities (approximately 0.84 percent of the total project budget).&#13;
&#13;
The Cell, along with NGO partners, planned the communication activities to be undertaken on a six-monthly basis, taking&#13;
into account the key communication needs of the projectâ&#128;&#153;s stakeholders vis-Ã -vis the stage of implementation that the&#13;
project was under. The communication activities were undertaken at two different levels: at the grassroots level with key&#13;
stakeholders in the three pilot towns (undertaken by the NGOs selected for those towns); and with other stakeholders&#13;
(either at the local or state level, depending on the need perception of the SICS Cell members) at the SICS Cell&#13;
headquarters (in Hubli-Dharwad) or in Bengaluru (the state capital). Between August 2006 and July 2007, communication&#13;
activities undertaken by the NGOs in the three cities primarily centered on:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	    Conducting baseline surveys with demonstration zone residents to identify issues of concern related to the project.&#13;
â&#128;¢	    Facilitating the formation of street-level and ward-level water users committees (WUCs).&#13;
â&#128;¢	    Raising the awareness levels of the citizens in the demonstration zones about the project.&#13;
â&#128;¢	    Intensive interactions with&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
OC fees, the SIC Strategy, and the&#13;
high levels of capital maintenance.&#13;
The challenge is now to scale up this&#13;
demonstration project, not only to the&#13;
remaining parts of the three cities&#13;
but to other urban centers in India.&#13;
It is already clear that 24x7 water&#13;
supply is the expected benchmark.&#13;
In response to the success of the&#13;
demonstration projects, the GoK&#13;
has committed Rs. 735 crore&#13;
(US$163 million) to achieve full 24x7&#13;
supply for the three cities in the&#13;
demonstration project, with&#13;
Rs. 360 crore (US$80 million) for&#13;
Hubli alone. This will be a grant&#13;
requiring a 10 percent contribution&#13;
from the receiving ULBs and a 50&#13;
percent investment by the OC who&#13;
comes on board. The extent to which&#13;
private operators can take the risk&#13;
of their capital and operating costs&#13;
being recovered through revenue&#13;
remains an open question.&#13;
&#13;
There are other 24x7 projects under&#13;
way around the country linked to&#13;
public-private partnerships. For&#13;
example, there has been a significant&#13;
follow-on demonstration zone&#13;
experiment in Nagpur, Maharashtra,&#13;
with 8,000 households now receiving&#13;
continuous water supply with the&#13;
significant comment that â&#128;&#156;standposts&#13;
are out, house connections for all,&#13;
and the poor have been the first to&#13;
payâ&#128;?, with only 30 percent mains&#13;
replacement necessary. There are&#13;
detailed plans to address the needs&#13;
of the entire city sooner rather than&#13;
later, through some form of hybrid&#13;
affermage/lease requiring a 30&#13;
percent capital contribution from the&#13;
operator. This is an arrangement&#13;
which is likely to be more common&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 21&#13;
&amp;#12;than the management fee used&#13;
under KUWASIP which was&#13;
designed specifically to demonstrate&#13;
24x7 water supply.&#13;
&#13;
There is a risk that the desire for&#13;
reductions in costs when scaling&#13;
up might lead to a reduction in&#13;
quality, both in materials used and&#13;
in implementation, particularly the&#13;
social intermediation. One solution is&#13;
to require longer postimplementation&#13;
operating periods to ensure&#13;
quality, with a performance bonus&#13;
dependent upon ongoing success.&#13;
This presupposes that operators-&#13;
consultants-contractors will continue&#13;
to be employed to scale up the&#13;
24x7 process. At this stage of&#13;
the reform it is critical to maintain&#13;
significant incentives for world class&#13;
performance, whether private or&#13;
public, international or Indian.&#13;
&#13;
In the KUWASIP project, the OC&#13;
has demonstrated the degree of&#13;
implementation quality, attention&#13;
to detail, and the knowledge and&#13;
competence in normal network&#13;
management that is required to be&#13;
successful. It will be critical for the&#13;
success of the scale up that similar&#13;
standards are achieved elsewhere.&#13;
This will require the ongoing level&#13;
of incentives, work ethic, and&#13;
reputation risk traditionally&#13;
associated with the private sector,&#13;
even while the public apprehensions&#13;
associated with private sector&#13;
participation gradually diminish&#13;
by demonstration of improved&#13;
service levels.&#13;

a State Urban Water Council with&#13;
responsibility for performance&#13;

24x7 system is primarily an O&amp;M&#13;
initiative. Appropriate mechanisms&#13;
are therefore required to incentivize&#13;
efficient operations and service&#13;
provision. The national Service&#13;

            India - The Karnataka urban water sector
            improvement project : 24x7 water supply is achievable
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In 2003, the Government of India had
            posed this question at a workshop: Is the essential goal of
            24-hour water supply in urban India achievable? At that time
            it was understood that none of the 51,612 urban local bodies
            in India was delivering a 24x7 water supply. This Field Note
            describes how, in the demonstration zones of three cities in
            Karnataka, it has proved possible to deliver continuous 24x7
            water supply through individual household connections to all
            residents, including the poorest. This has been achieved
            with a 10 percent reduction in overall water consumed,
            whilst increasing the revenue billed by a factor of five,
            and increasing the revenue collected by a factor of almost
            seven. This Note begins by describing the current situation
            and challenges of intermittent water supply. It then tells
            how the project was implemented. The next section discusses
            lessons learned, and afterwards, what would it take to scale
            up the project. The last section presents conclusions.
