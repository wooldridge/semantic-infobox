            The World Bank has well over 100
            projects involving private participation in infrastructure
            (PPI) in its pipeline, the IFC has participated in 100 more
            PPI projects, and MIGA provides guarantees in support of
            such projects. In the course of this work, the Bank Group is
            amassing information on the legal, regulatory,
            institutional, and transactional issues confronting PPI
            projects in developing countries. The author provides a
            guide to the English-language publications and documents on
            PPI issues that the Bank Group has produced since 1992.
