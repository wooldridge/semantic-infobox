            The contribution of the financial sector
            to economic growth depends on how well it deploys its risk,
            skills, and information capital. This Note offers a
            framework for improving the way countries deploy these
            resources. If they succeed, capital should be able to
            support more investment at manageable risk levels. This
            framework guides World Bank support to financial sector development.
