I. SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING EDUCATION&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.1         Sound  macroeconomic  policies have  underpinned  Thailand's economic&#13;
performance in recent years, making it among the best in the world with real GDP growing at&#13;
almost 11% p.a. during 1987-1993. Rapid industrialization has been a key to this performance.&#13;
Manufacturing now accounts for over 27% of GDP giving Thailand the largest manufacturing&#13;
sector within ASEAN. A strong export performance has been sustained with manufacturing&#13;
exports growing about 25% p.a. in real terms during 1986-93. This success has been built&#13;
largely on the expansion of relatively low-technology, low wage/skill production in such&#13;
industries as textiles, apparel and basic electronics and sustained by a steady flow of foreign&#13;
direct investment. However, Thailand's comparative advantage in these industries is being&#13;
eroded and to sustain growth prospects in the long term, the country will need to maintain its&#13;
competitiveness and move up the technology chain to produce higher value-added technology-&#13;
intensive products.&#13;
1.2         In order to do this, Thailand must address an increasingly serious human resource&#13;
constraint in the form of rising shortages of scientific and technical skills accompanied by a&#13;
relatively low level of education in the workforce. While this broad-based human resource&#13;
problem must be addressed, the key leadership role in Thailand's technological transformation&#13;
will be played by graduates in science and engineering produced by the universities. Shortages&#13;
of scientists and engineers have been widely reported and international indicators show that&#13;
Thailand is not well-endowed with scientific and technical (S&amp;T) skills. S&amp;T manpower is&#13;
currently around 13 per 10,000 of the labor force compared with Korea which had 37 per 10,000&#13;
in 1990. The annual number of engineering graduates per million of population is currently&#13;
around 70 in Thailand compared with nearly 660 per million in Korea in 1991. A low level of&#13;
R&amp;D investment and little private sector contribution is another area in which Thailand is&#13;
lagging. Policies are being implemented to raise the output of scientists and engineers as well as&#13;
to strengthen R&amp;D activities (paras. 1.34-1.36).&#13;
B. Overview of Higher Education&#13;
1.3         Thailand's education system is highly developed. A strong commitment to equity&#13;
has led to universal access to primary education, with high completion rates, as well as to the&#13;
establishment of effective nonformal programs to increase adult literacy. Lower secondary&#13;
education has been expanded to provide places for about half of the primary school graduates,&#13;
and in principle there is an upper secondary place for each graduate of lower secondary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
education, nearly half of whom  are in vocational schools and colleges.  The secondary&#13;
enrollment rate in Thailand stagnated through the 1980s at about 30% of the age group, which&#13;
was about half the rates in Malaysia and Indonesia and one-third of those in Korea and Taiwan,&#13;
China. The Government responded to the problem by extending the basic education cycle from 6&#13;
to 9 years i.e. to include the first three years of secondary education. By 1997, it is planned that&#13;
all grade 6 graduates will enter grade 7. This policy will result in a corresponding expansion of&#13;
upper secondary enrollments. At the end of secondary schooling, about 43% of the grade 12&#13;
students take the National University Entrance Examination, a vehicle to screen entrants to&#13;
degree programs in conventional public universities in which enrollments have remained tightly&#13;
controlled. The number of places for new entrants is set at 42,502 or 32% of the total number of&#13;
candidates (134,654).&#13;
1.4           The Thai higher education system  is unique in its composition, encompassing&#13;
conventional public and private institutions, as well as two large-scale open/distance universities,&#13;
all of which enrolled about 733,343 students in 1994 (Annex 1). Traditional public institutions&#13;
admit students strictly on academic criteria, and are characterized by relatively small enrollments&#13;
(155,602 in 1993) which have been quite stable in recent years, and high unit costs (B53,040 or&#13;
$2,210 per student), of which only about 5-10% is recovered via student fees. The open/distance&#13;
universities, Ramkhamhaeng University (RU) and Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University&#13;
(STOU), enroll the largest number of students, about 494,115 in 1993. Their unit costs are low&#13;
(B600 per student),' about half of which are recovered via student fees. With an enrollment ratio&#13;
of 20%,2 the coverage of the Thai higher education system is well above that in other countries at&#13;
the same per capita income level.&#13;
1.5           There are 35 private colleges and universities, consisting of 70%  for profit and&#13;
30% non-profit. Most of the operating costs are financed through student fees. Almost half of&#13;
these institutions are located in the Bangkok metropolitan region while the remainder are&#13;
scattered throughout the country. They offer mainly bachelor's degree programs, but graduate&#13;
programs are gradually being introduced.  Private universities are also starting to enter&#13;
engineering education (para. 1.36).  In recent years, enrollments in private colleges and&#13;
universities have been growing more rapidly than that in public institutions, from 117,390&#13;
students in 1992 to 141,920 in 1994.&#13;
l World Bank (1991) "Decision and Change in Thailand: Three Studies in Support of the Seventh Plan".&#13;
2 Total enrollment in higher education divided by the population in the relevant age group. However, the coverage&#13;
rate needs to be adjusted to assess the volume of graduates produced. In the case of Thailand, the adjustment is&#13;
necessary since a sizable share of the students in the large-scale open/distance system, mainly in STOU, are&#13;
employed people not seeking a degree but simply to upgrade their skills. Moreover, a significant number of&#13;
students in both RU and STOU attend part-time, and so complete their courses over a much longer period (4-8&#13;
years) than their peers in the conventional institutions. This pattern suggests that the number of "active" students is&#13;
much less than enrollment. An estimate of "active" students can be derived by applying the 25% graduation rate to&#13;
the total enrolled. Adding this result to enrollments in the traditional closed universities and MOE's degree granting&#13;
institutions gives an adjusted total higher education enrollment in 1987 of about 423,000 which translates to an&#13;
enrollment ratio of 11.9%. This is still above the average of around 10% for a country at Thailand's income level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
1.6         The Ministry of University Affairs (MUA) oversees the 23 public and 35 private&#13;
conventional universities and colleges, as well as the two open universities. In addition, the&#13;
Ministry of Education (MOE) has authority over 36 teacher colleges (which also offer a range of&#13;
non-teaching vocational courses) and 31 campuses of the Rajamangala Institute of Technology&#13;
(RIT) which offer degree level courses as well as certificate and diploma courses. Enrollments&#13;
in these two systems were about 270,000 and 72,100 respectively in 1994.&#13;
Science and Engineering Education&#13;
1.7         There are 23 faculties of science in the public universities, including&#13;
Ramkhamhaeng Open University (Annex 2). New faculties of engineering and science are being&#13;
established in three other public universities. Plans are being made for the establishment of four&#13;
new public universities with strong faculties of science and engineering. The existing science&#13;
faculties can be categorized as: (a) faculties developing new undergraduate science degrees&#13;
(either as a new university, as a new faculty of science or as converting a science support&#13;
program into a full science degree program); or as (b) faculties with established degree programs&#13;
which are trying to upgrade the quality of their activities in a time of enrollment expansion.&#13;
Within the faculties there are 112 departments concentrated mainly in mathematics and related&#13;
subjects (29% of total departments), biological sciences (21%), chemistry (19%) and physical&#13;
sciences (15%).&#13;
1.8         Admission to the faculties of science and engineering is based on the candidate&#13;
possessing a secondary school certificate with the science/math elective and on his/her ranking,&#13;
within the grade range set by each university, obtained by the candidate in the National&#13;
University Entrance Examination. These requirements are applicable to all admissions to the&#13;
public universities in the Bangkok metropolitan region.  In the regional universities, 50% of&#13;
admissions is allocated to those who have passed the Entrance Examination and have chosen the&#13;
regional university and faculty. The remaining 50% is allocated each year to secondary school&#13;
certificate holders in the region who pass the regional university's own entrance examination. If&#13;
quotas need to be made up, there is provision for some individual departments to set their own&#13;
entrance examinations. This approach has improved the equity of access to universities outside&#13;
Bangkok and given rural students greater opportunities to study science and engineering and&#13;
thereby qualify for high-paying employment in the future.&#13;
1.9         Enrollments in the science faculties in the public universities (excluding RU,&#13;
which experienced substantial annual fluctuations) increased at about 11.5% p.a. during 1989-93.&#13;
Enrollments in the engineering faculties grew at about 14.5% during the same period giving a&#13;
combined annual enrollment growth of around 13%. This is not appreciably below the target of&#13;
15% annual enrollment growth in science and engineering called for in the Seventh Plan (1992-&#13;
96), (para. 1.35).  The annual output of bachelors of science was 2,240 (including 598 from an&#13;
open university) in 1990 and this had increased to 3,030 in 1993.&#13;

1.10         The faculties of science offer programs in two categories: (a) courses for students&#13;
majoring in science i.e. those pursuing a B.S. degree; and (b) service courses for non-major&#13;
students who are enrolled in other faculties such as engineering, medicine and agriculture. The&#13;
number of credit hours required for the award of a B.S. degree is in the range 130-150 with some&#13;
variation between universities. Typically, basic science courses account for nearly 30% of total&#13;
credit hours and major subjects for nearly 50%.  General education, including languages,&#13;
accounts for the remainder. Within the science major, laboratory work takes up 15-25% of the&#13;
total, becoming more important in the senior years of the B.S. degree.&#13;
1.11         There are 15 schools of engineering in the public universities (Annex 2) offering&#13;
the B.Eng. degree in 23 disciplines. The structure of enrollments tends to reflect a past lack of&#13;
emphasis on the production of S&amp;T manpower. Enrollments in undergraduate basic science and&#13;
engineering programs (35,750 in the public conventional universities) represent only about 23%&#13;
of total enrollments.  In Korea, the proportion is 36%.  Females represent 10% of total&#13;
engineering enrollments but the figure rises to 52% in science, concentrated mainly in biology&#13;
and related disciplines. Market information does influence engineering enrollments. This is&#13;
reflected in a declining trend in enrollments in mining while there is a substantial increase in&#13;
computer/electrical/electronic engineering, as a consequence of the growing demand to service&#13;
the computer/electronics/information technology diffusion. Increasing enrollments are also&#13;
evident in environmental engineering, as environmental legislation begins to impact on&#13;
infrastructure services and in industrial engineering, as industrial productivity gains capture the&#13;
attention of industrial managers.&#13;
1.12         Two models of undergraduate engineering education coexist, differing in the&#13;
extent of specialization and the practical orientation of the subject matter. In the first group are&#13;
most engineering departments which place emphasis on the fundamentals of engineering&#13;
synthesis in a given engineering discipline, with offerings of departmental majors and technical&#13;
electives that contribute to the flexibility of the programs. The gap in hard core engineering&#13;
education (e.g. in production engineering, design) is shared with industry during the compulsory&#13;
industrial training requirement (para. 1.13). Examples are electrical engineering departments&#13;
with majors in electrical power; electronics and communications; and control systems. Another&#13;
is the civil engineering department with departmental majors in structural, geo-technical,&#13;
transportation, construction and environmental engineering.  The second group comprises&#13;
specialized engineering departments with emphasis on in-house hard core engineering and work&#13;
on technical applications. They offer training with a strong vocational orientation and have close&#13;
links with industry. Examples of such programs are the departments of instrumentation and&#13;
control engineering, telecommunications engineering, electronics, and computer engineering.&#13;
Accreditation practice has a basis similar to that of the US Accreditation Board for Engineering&#13;
and Technology, where engineering professional societies determine periodically the distribution&#13;
of semester hours credits among science subjects (Annex 3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
1.13        Most engineering departments have, on the average, a. satisfactory minimum&#13;
credit requirement of 150 credit units for the undergraduate degree. Each engineering discipline&#13;
contains a mix of natural sciences, mathematics and engineering sciences. This mix serves to&#13;
diversify and broaden the spectrum of course offerings within the engineering specialization.&#13;
The fundamentals of computer engineering and engineering graphics are required subjects for all&#13;
undergraduate students during the first two years of studies. In addition, a compulsory industrial&#13;
training of 240 hours is also required at the end of the third year of studies.&#13;
1.14        The internal efficiency of science and engineering programs is high. In science&#13;
the passing rate is around 88%. It should also be recognized that the drop-out/failure rate is less&#13;
than the 12% implied from the previous figure because a number of students complete&#13;
successfully the first year of the B.S. program and then transfer to other majors such as&#13;
engineering and medicine. In engineering, the passing rate is almost identical at 87%. There is&#13;
a tendency for dropout rates to be higher in the newer regional universities but this reflects in&#13;
part the transfer of some of students to more prestigious universities after successfully&#13;
completing first year studies.&#13;
1.15        Studies have shown that engineering graduates have no difficulty finding&#13;
employment.3 The placement rates are: 100% for structural and construction engineering; 90-&#13;
98% for materials handling technology, production engineering, mechanical engineering,&#13;
electrical, and chemical engineering; and 80-88% for civil engineering and petroleum&#13;
engineering. The employment of science graduates is harder to track because there is a much&#13;
looser fit between science qualifications and job requirements than in the case of engineers.&#13;
Data for 1989 show an employment rate of 82% for BS graduates and the current rate is&#13;
undoubtedly higher due to the increasing demand for science-trained manpower in recent years.&#13;
Financing&#13;
1.16        Public education is supported almost entirely by the central government. The&#13;
share of the central government budget allocated to education grew from 17% in 1989 to 19.6%&#13;
in 1993, and over the same period total education expenditure (public and private) increased its&#13;
share in GDP from about 2.7 to 3.6%. In 1993, public expenditure by level was allocated as&#13;
follows: 49% primary, 28% secondary, 17% higher and 6% other (including assistance to private&#13;
schools and educational services and support).&#13;
1.17        The share of higher education as a percentage of total education expenditure&#13;
declined steadily during the last decade. As a percentage of the national budget, higher education&#13;
represented 4.6% in the late 1960s; this had increased to 5.0% in 1976, but had decreased to&#13;
3.4% by 1990. Nevertheless, total public expenditures for higher education increased from B3.1&#13;

Study of Graduate Employment Situation."&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
billion in 1976 to BI 1.5 billion in 1990. In 1994, about 35% of the higher education budget was&#13;
allocated to salaries and wages, and 10% to equipment, land and construction, 15% to subsidies,&#13;
37% to general expenses, and 3% to utilities. In 1989, the unit cost of higher education as a&#13;
percentage of GNP per capita was 34%.4&#13;
1.18          Fees are levied at the secondary and tertiary levels but the proportion of recurrent&#13;
expenditures recovered at the higher education level is lower than at secondary school level. It is&#13;
estimated at only around 7% of recurrent costs in heavily subsidized conventional public&#13;
universities5 and about 10% in secondary schools. When capital cost is added, the estimated&#13;
percentage of tuition fees and other private educational costs to the total cost becomes lower.&#13;
The unit costs of higher education differ sharply between the conventional and open universities.&#13;
Among conventional universities, the unit costs range from B 132,000 in Mahidol to B 13,000 in&#13;
Srinakharintaraviroj. This wide dispersion stems in part from differences in specializations&#13;
offered, relative emphasis between research and teaching, as well as the size of institutions.&#13;
Among open universities, the unit costs range from B11,140 in RU to B520 in STOU. This wide&#13;
variation results from the different modes of instruction used in these two institutions.6&#13;
C. Major Issues in Science and Engineering Education&#13;
1.19          The recent economic expansion, which began in the mid eighties, was driven by&#13;
the rise in manufacturing exports and the surge in private investment, and this intensified&#13;
Thailand's human resources bottleneck, particularly the shortages of science and engineering&#13;
manpower.&#13;
Science and Technology Manpower Requirements&#13;
1.20          In 1991, the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) made manpower&#13;
projections based on a survey of 1000 firms in the public and private sectors.' The forecasting&#13;
model indicated high growth trends in the utility and transportation sectors, construction, and&#13;
textile and garment industries, and a low growth rate for agriculture, basic industries and the fuel&#13;
sector. The TDRI's projected demand for science and engineering (S&amp;E) graduates is shown&#13;
below:&#13;

1.21         The extent of the shortage of engineering graduates in Thailand can also be&#13;
assessed by comparison with neighboring countries in terms of the annual number of engineering&#13;
graduates per one million population:&#13;

as follows:&#13;

The target of an annual output of 8,000 engineering graduates is not likely to be met by the end&#13;
of the Seventh Plan in 1996.&#13;
1.23          One of the main constraints to increased production of science and engineering&#13;
graduates is the difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified staff in public universities in the&#13;
face of rising demand in the private sector. This problem needs to be addressed if MUA's plan&#13;
to increase admissions to undergraduate programs in science and engineering by 15% annually is&#13;
to be achieved. Since university professors' salaries are based on the civil service pay scale, their&#13;
salaries are much lower than those offered by the private sector.' In areas of serious shortage, a&#13;
scheme is operating to top-up salaries through the award of research honoraria. However, the&#13;
top-up does not provide competitive salaries and the scheme has had only limited success.&#13;
1.24          In order to attract more qualified scholars to public universities, the MUA plans&#13;
to: (a) improve the academic working conditions and R&amp;D facilities; (b) support the transfer of&#13;
advanced technology from abroad; and (c) expand S&amp;T cooperation with other countries. In&#13;
addition, MUA would also provide overseas fellowships to public university professors and other&#13;
prospective professorial candidates.9 However, given the current pool of 1,323 full-time&#13;

9  Under the "Teaching Staff Development 7-Year Program" some 120 potential lecturers of the faculties of&#13;
engineering would be sent abroad annually for 5 years to complete their masters and doctoral degrees, another 50,&#13;
currently studying in-country for their postgraduate degrees, would complete their dissertation/research abroad.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
engineering teachers in the public universities' faculties of engineering, it is unlikely that the&#13;
universities can sustain a large outflow for overseas study without seriously lowering the quality&#13;
of engineering education. The current practice of some of the new engineering departments to&#13;
depend on part-time teachers is not the best solution to introducing new curricula or to setting up&#13;
modem laboratories. A possible solution, being considered by MUA, is to recruit full-time&#13;
foreign professors during this interim period.&#13;
1.25          In  an  effort to  make  university  teaching  more attractive, the  MUA  is&#13;
implementing a policy for the two new public universities (Suranaree and Valailak), allowing the&#13;
universities to receive government funds as a block grant rather than as a line budget allocation.&#13;
The grant approach gives flexibility to the setting of salaries with the result that competitive&#13;
salaries can be offered to high quality faculty. Furthermore, universities are not required to&#13;
return unspent grant funds to the treasury. MUA's move to have this arrangement extended to&#13;
public universities established under the old law has been delayed by the political process. Some&#13;
of the measures being taken by regional universities to retain teaching staff include setting up&#13;
staff housing cooperatives and levying a special fee of B600 per credit unit for topping up staff&#13;
salaries.&#13;
Academic Staffing&#13;
1.26          Faculty qualifications need to be raised. Only about 27% of engineering faculty&#13;
and 31% of the science faculty have doctorates (compared with about 80% of such faculty in&#13;
Korea). Most of the faculty have masters degrees and many of them are young and are suitable&#13;
candidates for doctoral studies. The problem is being addressed through the teaching staff&#13;
development program which is sending qualified academics overseas to obtain higher degrees&#13;
(para. 1.24).&#13;
1.27          The overall staff/student ratio in the engineering faculties is around 1:18, on the&#13;
basis of the student enrollments in each of the 4 years of undergraduate studies and graduate&#13;
programs. A more rational ratio is derived by excluding first year students as they are taught by&#13;
general subject teachers in such courses as basic science, mathematics, language and humanities.&#13;
In this case, the overall staff/student ratio in engineering is more reasonable, at 1:12.10 In the&#13;
science faculties (excluding the open universities), the overall staff/student ratio is a reasonable&#13;
1:12.4, but if adjustment is made for the teaching of basic service courses in the first year, the&#13;
ratio improves to 1:9.4. However, there is evidence that the ratios for both engineering and&#13;
science have been deteriorating in recent years as academic staff have been recruited to industry&#13;
while enrollments have continued to rise. Between 1992 and 1993, teaching staff in the science&#13;
faculties declined by 5% with Ph.Ds departing at double this rate. The overall staff/student ratio&#13;
Furthermore, some 70 teaching staff annually will spend a year abroad on fellowships for upgrading and another 70&#13;
senior staff on short exposure visits.&#13;
10 This overall ratio conceals less satisfactory individual ratios, for example at King Mongkhut's Institute of&#13;
Technology, North Bangkok and to a lesser extent at Kasetsart University, which have been brought about by recent&#13;
substantial increases in admissions to their undergraduate engineering programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
in engineering declined from  1:16.2 in 1991 to 1:18.4 in 1992.  Thus, if MUA's goal of&#13;
increasing admissions to undergraduate programs in science and engineering by 15% annually is&#13;
to be achieved, while retaining acceptable staff/student ratios, the universities will have to recruit&#13;
and retain additional faculty.&#13;
Curriculum&#13;
1.28          Current engineering  and  science education curricula often do not reflect&#13;
adequately the emerging needs of the country's technology development. For example, the&#13;
faculties of engineering offer the B. Eng. in 23 disciplines but lack undergraduate disciplines&#13;
associated with materials engineering, biotechnology and machinery design engineering.&#13;
However, efforts are now being made by several universities to offer these and related&#13;
disciplines.&#13;
1.29          While there is some interdisciplinary collaboration between the faculty of&#13;
engineering and the other faculties in the preparation of final year student projects, and students&#13;
have the option of free electives, there is no major effort in interdisciplinary studies in areas&#13;
where it is most needed such as environmental engineering, where the emphasis continues to be&#13;
on water, sewage and soils to the exclusion of air/atmospheric pollution.&#13;
1.30          Although there is a required industrial training period as part of the curriculum,&#13;
this does not make up for the shortcomings of the programs offered by many faculties of&#13;
engineering, where laboratory work and practice account for only 8% of the total credit units&#13;
compared with 20% in Korea." Furthermore, the placement of students for industrial training is&#13;
expected to become increasingly difficult as enrollments expand.&#13;
Equipment&#13;
1.31          The lack of up-to-date equipment is widespread in science and engineering&#13;
laboratories and this is lowering the quality of courses offered. It has also inhibited the&#13;
introduction of new courses relevant to Thailand's technological advancement such as new&#13;
material science, biotechnology, etc. Many older established engineering departments have&#13;
made modest changes in curricula to reflect modem practices but very little has been done to&#13;
modernize their teaching, testing and research laboratories, most of which still reflect 25-year old&#13;
technology. Many testing machines stand idle as spare parts are no longer available in the&#13;
market. MUA's investment budget for equipping the faculties of engineering totaling B677&#13;
million during 1987-1993 was spent entirely on introducing computer/information technology.&#13;
" King Mongkhut's Institute of Technology has successfully managed, through considerable investment in&#13;
equipment, to raise its credit requirement for laboratory work and practice to 14%. Suranaree University of&#13;
Technology is introducing a trimester system and cooperative program (a sandwich of 4-month slices) alternatively&#13;
on campus and in employment in industry; this work experience carries 12 trimester credit units.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
With the student enrollment of 22,025 in 1993, investment per student was very low. Despite an&#13;
increase to B541 million in 1994, the investment in laboratory equipment will amount to only&#13;
about US$2,100 per student, which is less than half that invested in the national colleges of&#13;
engineering in Korea.&#13;
1.32        In the science laboratories, equipment deficiencies range from  inadequate&#13;
provision of basic teaching equipment to lack of the more complex items needed to teach the&#13;
advanced courses.   This situation weakens the teaching of fundamentals in basic science&#13;
programs which affects adversely both students majoring in science and those taking basic&#13;
service courses as part of other majors such as engineering.  The lack of more advanced&#13;
equipment lowers the quality of laboratory work which is particularly important in the senior&#13;
years. The fact that much of the existing equipment is out of date impedes students in gaining&#13;
familiarity with the types of instrumentation used in industry. It also reduces the capacity of&#13;
senior students to carry out project work in which they gain vital research experience.  To&#13;
overcome the deficiencies in the provision of laboratory equipment, a re-equipment plan has&#13;
been proposed which calls for US$227 million for the science faculties and US$268 million for&#13;
engineering during 1995-99.&#13;
D. Government's Policies and Plans&#13;
1.33        The Seventh Plan (1992-96) recognizes that expansion of secondary education&#13;
must be given a high priority if the education level of the workforce is to be raised to enhance&#13;
productivity and also to provide the basis for the expansion of higher education. The Plan calls&#13;
for extending compulsory education from six to nine years. The transition rate from primary to&#13;
secondary was planned to rise to at least 73% by 1996 and this target has already been exceeded -&#13;
the rate being 86% in 1994. Consequently, the Government now intends to achieve a transition&#13;
rate of 100% by 1997. The major impact of the expansion has been felt outside Bangkok where&#13;
families in the provinces have responded positively to special incentive programs to increase&#13;
enrollments.12 The Plan also recognizes that a more advanced technological future for Thailand&#13;
must be underpinned by greater emphasis on education in science, mathematics, foreign&#13;
languages and in vocational and technical fields. This would be achieved through revising&#13;
relevant curricula at all levels, upgrading academic staff in higher education through fellowships&#13;
for higher degrees, strengthening inservice teacher training, and modernizing laboratories and&#13;
workshops. These quality-improving investments would underpin the policy of increasing the&#13;
supply of technically and scientifically-trained manpower at all levels, in response to serious&#13;
shortages in the labor market.&#13;
1.34        Within the university subsector, the Plan addresses concerns about shortages of&#13;
S&amp;T manpower by laying down specific targets for a significant expansion in the production of&#13;
12 See Staff Appraisal Report of the Secondary Education Quality Improvement Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
scientists and engineers. On the understanding that developing indigenous technology is a&#13;
crucial factor in economic growth, the government set specific targets to increase: (a) the number&#13;
of engineers from 9.8 to 14.9 per 10,000 population; (b) the number of scientists from 7.2 to&#13;
10.2; (c) the number of agriculturists from 6.7 to 10.5; and (d) the number of S&amp;T researchers&#13;
from 1.4 to 2.5 per 10,000 population, with an increase in the R&amp;D budget from 0.2% of GNP in&#13;
1987 to at least 1% by 1997 and 1.5% by 2004. The output of science graduates is planned to&#13;
increase from about 2,000 in 1992 to 5,000 in 1996 and the output of engineers from about 4,100&#13;
to 5,500 during the same period.&#13;
1.35        The Plan calls for increasing the annual admission to the public universities in the&#13;
fields of science and engineering by 15% with the aim of changing the current proportion of&#13;
graduates from 30% for science and technology and 70% for arts and social sciences to 40% and&#13;
60%, respectively, by 1996, and to 50% each by the year 2000. In the latter year, it is expected&#13;
that 20% of graduates will be in engineering and 30% in the sciences. To achieve this, the MUA&#13;
plans to: (a) increase student enrollments in the existing faculties of engineering and science in&#13;
eight public universities; (b) establish new faculties of engineering and science in three other&#13;
existing public universities; and (c) create four new public universities with strong faculties of&#13;
science and engineering.&#13;
1.36        MUA has eased regulations on private universities, now permitting them to offer&#13;
engineering degree programs.  Fourteen private universities have established faculties of&#13;
engineering, which in the 1993-94 academic year admitted approximately 2100 students to the&#13;
B.Eng. degree programs. Admissions are open to secondary school graduates, from both the&#13;
general and technical/vocational streams. Accreditation of engineering degree programs offered&#13;
by private universities is closely monitored by the Bureau of Private Higher Education Standards&#13;
of MUA. No transfer system exists at present between public and private universities. In&#13;
addition, the MUA has initiated a new law to make university teaching more attractive to faculty,&#13;
although extension of this law beyond the two new public universities has been delayed (para&#13;
1.25). The Government has also introduced a B20 billion loan fund with subsidized interest&#13;
rates to support the expansion of private institutions.&#13;
1.37        To complement expansion plans, quality improvement measures are also being&#13;
taken.  The qualifications of the faculty are being raised.  Only about 24% of engineering&#13;
faculty and 31% of science faculty have doctorates (compared with nearly 80% of such faculty&#13;
in Korea). The Government is therefore implementing a program which provides about 200&#13;
overseas fellowships per year for faculty to pursue graduate degrees. This is complemented by a&#13;
program of practical training overseas to ensure that well-qualified faculty are exposed to the&#13;
latest trends in science and engineering teaching, relevant research, new teaching technologies,&#13;
etc. The lack of up-to-date equipment and weak management are widespread in the science and&#13;
engineering laboratories and this is lowering the quality of courses and inhibiting research. A&#13;
large-scale program for modernizing laboratory equipment is in place (with a total cost of nearly&#13;
US$600 million) and a plan for strengthening laboratory management has also been drawn up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
II. THE BANK'S EXPERIENCE AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
A. Bank's Experience in Education&#13;
2.1         The Bank has assisted the development of Thailand's education system under six&#13;
loans/credits during the period 1966-82. Bank lending amounted to US$ 154 million or about&#13;
35% of total project costs of US$453 million. The overall direction of Bank lending under the&#13;
six projects was consistent with education policy as it evolved under the first five national plans&#13;
(1962-86). The first two projects focused on increasing the supply of technical manpower for&#13;
industry and agriculture. Later projects had a broader educational focus and were consistent with&#13;
the major educational reforms, introduced in 1978, which aimed at equality of educational&#13;
opportunity, curriculum reform and improved management of the education system.&#13;
Consequently, the later projects focused on the expansion of educational capacity in the rural&#13;
areas, the introduction of diversified secondary curricula and the strengthening of education&#13;
management."&#13;
2.2         The first education project in Thailand (Ln. 471-TH) supported quality&#13;
improvement and expansion of outputs in selected vocational institutions. The project financed&#13;
construction, renovation and equipment for 24 trade, industrial and agricultural schools and an&#13;
agricultural teacher training college.  The project also included technical assistance for&#13;
curriculum development and for upgrading teacher training. The PPAR for the project (Report&#13;
No. 770, June 13, 1975) concluded that the project was implemented successfully. In general,&#13;
overall enrollment and output targets were met and new well-balanced curricula were introduced.&#13;
The technical assistance program was completed successfully and this was due, in part, to close&#13;
cooperation between overseas advisers and local counterparts. Equipment procurement was&#13;
delayed initially due to the late arrival of advisers and this delay was exacerbated by cumbersome&#13;
procurement procedures.  These problems were largely responsible for the project being&#13;
completed four years behind schedule. Some items of equipment were judged to be too&#13;
sophisticated for the schools and, in the case of some agricultural equipment, not relevant to local&#13;
conditions. Some difficulty was experienced in retaining teachers with practical industry-related&#13;
experience because of the demand for such skills in the labor market.&#13;
2.3         The second education project (Ln. 822-TH) assisted in upgrading education and&#13;
research in agriculture and related fields in Kasetsart (Agricultural) University and also assisted&#13;
its move to a new rural campus. The project financed site development, construction, furniture&#13;
and equipment, and technical assistance for curriculum development, university management and&#13;
project unit support. The PPAR for the project (Report No. 4563, June 17, 1983) concluded that&#13;
the major objectives of the project were achieved although project completion was nearly three&#13;
years behind schedule. The latter was caused partly by an unrealistic implementation schedule&#13;
13 For a detailed review of Bank assistance to Thailand under the six projects, see: Educational Developmen In&#13;
Thailand: The Role of World Bank Lending. (Report No. 7306, June 24, 1988).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
and also by design and construction delays in the civil works component. Targets for new&#13;
student places were met. Equipment procurement was fully satisfactory and the technical&#13;
assistance program was also implemented effectively. Regarding the latter, there was close&#13;
cooperation between advisers and local counterparts. The fellowship program resulted in a&#13;
substantial increase in faculty with graduate degrees. One weakness in project implementation&#13;
was that insufficient attention was paid to educational aspects of the project institution such as&#13;
changes in admissions, enrollments, graduates and the employment experience of the latter.&#13;
Thus there was only limited understanding of the educational impact of the project.&#13;
2.4         The third education project (Cr. 369-TH) marked a shift in emphasis away from&#13;
the narrower focus of meeting technical manpower requirements towards improving educational&#13;
opportunities, especially in the provinces. The third project aimed to extend and improve&#13;
elementary teacher training facilities in the provinces, introduce a diversified curriculum in rural&#13;
secondary schools, improve educational research and curriculum design and extend science&#13;
programs and assist long range planning in the Prince of Songkla University in the south of&#13;
Thailand. The project financed construction, furniture and equipment for selected primary&#13;
teachers' training colleges, rural high schools, a National Curriculum Development Center&#13;
(NCDC) and the Prince of Songkla University. Expert services and fellowships were included&#13;
under the project's technical assistance program. The PPAR for the project (Report No. 4574,&#13;
June 27, 1983), concluded that the project's objectives were met, with the exception of the&#13;
teacher training component. The diversified curricula for the rural secondary schools were&#13;
introduced successfully, the NCDC was operating effectively (although it could benefit from a&#13;
sharpening of the focus of its research function), the university science programs were improved&#13;
and their quantitative targets virtually achieved.  Expansion of rural teacher training&#13;
opportunities was achieved but not to the extent envisaged. Initially, there was a substantial&#13;
underestimation in teacher supply and the Government reduced teachers' college intakes because&#13;
of the emerging over-supply. Thus project-assisted colleges were underutilized. This situation&#13;
was identified soon after appraisal and project design should have been rectified accordingly.&#13;
The technical assistance program was generally successful but there was a need to monitor&#13;
fellows on their return to ensure that they entered positions relevant to their training. There was&#13;
also a need to observe a realistic mix between short study tours and long-term study for higher&#13;
degrees. The latter may not always be the most appropriate method of acquiring skills in certain&#13;
fields (e.g. curriculum development). The project closed 3.5 years behind schedule, due in part&#13;
to problems in the functioning of the project implementation unit, which lacked clearly-defined&#13;
jurisdiction and authority.&#13;
2.5         The fourth education project (Ln. 1271-TH) continued support for the expansion&#13;
of diversified secondary education in the provinces and assisted in the establishment of a national&#13;
adult education system. The project financed construction, furniture, equipment and technical&#13;
assistance for 50 diversified secondary schools and for four regional and 24 provincial adult&#13;
education centers. The project completion report (PCR) for the project (Report No. 5710, June&#13;
14, 1985), concluded that the project was a success with quantitative targets reached or&#13;
surpassed. Project implementation was facilitated by the establishment of a well-staffed Central&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
Project Unit (CPU), which was given the authority to simplify procurement procedures. The&#13;
technical assistance program was implemented successfully and the individuals who received&#13;
degree fellowships were, in the majority of cases, serving in relevant posts. Some difficulties&#13;
were experienced in the preparation of equipment lists and specifications for the adult education&#13;
component due to a lack of expertise in this area. The project was completed just over two years&#13;
behind schedule due partly to scarcity of counterpart funds and shortage of experienced&#13;
implementation staff in adult education.&#13;
2.6         The fifth education project (Cr. 913-TH) continued support for expanding&#13;
educational opportunities in rural areas and for strengthening management of the education&#13;
system and public administration in general. The project provided for the establishment of 12&#13;
centralized vocational workshops to serve local secondary schools, the upgrading of vocational&#13;
programs in 42 rural secondary schools, expansion of educational radio programs and the&#13;
creation of inservice management training institutes for educational administrators and civil&#13;
servants. The project was implemented successfully and closed on schedule. The PPAR for the&#13;
project (Report No. 7284, June 17, 1988) concluded that a strong CPU served successfully as a&#13;
coordinator and resource center for the individual implementing agencies. In general the&#13;
quantitative targets of the project were met. However, lack of thorough analysis of the catchment&#13;
areas for the centralized vocational workshops led to underutilization of some centers. The&#13;
overseas fellowship program was generally successful but there were some initial problems with&#13;
the language competence of fellows and some instances of fellows not being retained in the&#13;
positions for which they had been trained.&#13;
2.7         The sixth education project (Ln. 2178-TH) aimed to extend support for increasing&#13;
educational opportunities in disadvantaged areas to the lower secondary level and to strengthen&#13;
education planning and management. The project financed the upgrading of 480 rural lower&#13;
secondary schools through the addition of classrooms and workshops and the inservice training&#13;
of about 6,000 teaching and non-teaching staff.  Technical assistance was provided for&#13;
fellowships and experts in the fields of education planning and management. A program of eight&#13;
studies covering key educational issues was also included in the project. The project was&#13;
completed on schedule but over-estimation of project costs led to the cancellation of about 42%&#13;
of the loan amount. The PCR for the project (Report No. 8363, February 12, 1990) concluded&#13;
that while the physical aspects of the project were implemented successfully, educational&#13;
objectives were not fully achieved. Enrollments in project schools at project completion were&#13;
34% below target due to overly optimistic enrollment projections at appraisal and to other factors&#13;
such as high tuition and opportunity costs for students. Transition rates to lower secondary&#13;
education also declined. The local inservice training program was generally successful but there&#13;
were problems in the overseas fellowship component regarding deficient language competencies&#13;
and inadequate academic standards for entry to overseas institutions.  The planning and&#13;
management component was the least successful because it required significant organizational&#13;
and policy changes which could not be achieved within the scope of a single project but required&#13;
a sustained high-level policy dialogue between the Bank and Government. The program of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
studies would have benefited from a synthesis of their findings and the translation of these into&#13;
an action plan.&#13;
2.8         The seventh and eighth education projects were approved by the Executive&#13;
Directors in June 1996. The Secondary Education Quality Improvement Project (Ln. 4052-TH)&#13;
aims to strengthen teacher education in science and mathematics through raising the&#13;
qualifications of teacher educators in selected teacher colleges, modernizing laboratories and&#13;
workshops, strengthening inservice training of science and math teachers and improving the&#13;
research capacities of the teacher colleges. The Technical Education Project (Ln. 4053-TH) aims&#13;
to strengthen the training of craftsmen and technicians through improvements to curricula,&#13;
instructional materials and linkages to industry, modernizing workshops, reinforcing the practical&#13;
skills of teaching staff and improving the management of training institutions.&#13;
B. Lessons Learned&#13;
2.9         Projects assisting technical and secondary education, approved by the Board in&#13;
June 1996, are too recent to provide operational lessons. However, experience under previous&#13;
education projects in Thailand, although implemented mainly in the seventies and early eighties,&#13;
are still relevant to the proposed project. For example, overseas training programs need to be&#13;
carefully planned especially in relation to the language capabilities of candidates and their ability&#13;
gain entry to overseas institutions. Careful consideration should also be given to the structure of&#13;
training programs in relation to the needs for skill acquisition, especially in relation to the mix of&#13;
available options - formal courses, hands-on experience, seminars, etc. A well-staffed central&#13;
project implementation unit with appropriate links to participating institutions is essential to&#13;
ensure successful project implementation. Relevant lessons drawn from Bankwide experience&#13;
include: (a) the importance of involving end-users in the preparation of equipment lists to ensure&#13;
their relevance to users' needs; (b) the impact of overseas training projects is measured most&#13;
appropriately by the number of trainees returning to their posts rather than the number sent&#13;
abroad; and (c) the need for counterparts to work with expert advisers to ensure that local staff&#13;
gain from inservice training opportunities. The above lessons have been incorporated in project&#13;
design.&#13;
C. Bank's Assistance Strategy&#13;
2.10             The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Thailand (Report No.&#13;
1 3458-TH), which was presented to the Board on September 22, 1994, recognizes that Thailand&#13;
needs selective policy and technical advice and financing. Hence, Bank assistance aims at&#13;
providing value added in terms of helping to address the most important development issues,&#13;
many of which are cross-sectoral and involve the provision of public goods. These key&#13;
development priorities, on which Bank assistance would be focused, are: physical infrastructure&#13;
provision, human resource development, poverty reduction and improvement in income&#13;
distribution, and natural resource and environmental management. The CAS envisaged a lending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
program of around US$300 million per year during FY96-98 in these priority areas. It was also&#13;
indicated in the CAS that strong interest on the part of the Government in priority areas such as&#13;
the social sectors could lead to increased lending. With respect to education, this interest has&#13;
been declared by the Government through communications with the Bank, in public&#13;
pronouncements and through high priority being given to education in the Eighth Plan.&#13;
Consequently, a number of projects were identified which focused on sector priorities in&#13;
education.&#13;
2.11        The proposed project would assist in human resource development. Thailand's&#13;
economic success has been built on the expansion of manufactured exports, facilitated by&#13;
substantial foreign direct investment. This export-led growth strategy is now under pressure due&#13;
to rising real wages, and skill shortages, coupled with economic liberalization in labor-abundant&#13;
economies such as China, Vietnam and India. A key determinant of Thailand's continued&#13;
economic success, therefore, will be its ability to upgrade products and processes towards greater&#13;
technological sophistication. Whether this can be achieved quickly depends critically upon the&#13;
availability of skilled and educated labor. However, past under-investment in secondary, higher&#13;
and technical education, together with sectoral policy and institutional weaknesses, have meant&#13;
that labor quality constraints have become increasingly serious.&#13;
Education Lending Strategy&#13;
2.12        In recent years, post-primary education in Thailand has been unable to meet the&#13;
demands of a rapidly expanding economy for technical skills and for workers with a sound&#13;
general education. This has retarded productivity growth while skill shortages have pushed up&#13;
wages thereby putting pressure on the country's competitiveness.  The Government has&#13;
responded with policies that call for the expansion of technical and scientific education to&#13;
increase the supply of skills at all levels and also for the expansion of general secondary&#13;
education to increase the education level of entrants to the workforce and to expand the numbers&#13;
of potential entrants to higher education. A key concern underlying this expansion is the need to&#13;
maintain (and preferably improve) the quality of education in the face of rapidly expanding&#13;
enrollments.&#13;
2.13        Prior to restarting lending in 1996 (para. 2.8), the Bank made its last loan for&#13;
education to Thailand in 1982 in support of developing lower secondary education (para. 2.7).&#13;
This was followed by a Government policy of not seeking Bank financing in the social sectors.&#13;
In 1990-91 the Bank prepared an in-depth review of vocational education and a review of key&#13;
issues in education.  These reviews were well-received in Thailand but did not lead to any&#13;
discernible action to implement the policy recommendations contained therein. However in&#13;
1993, recognizing the growing inadequacies in the education system, the Government asked the&#13;
Bank to look at the possibilities of restarting lending to education.&#13;
2.14        The education lending strategy is based on the assumption that if the Bank is to&#13;
make a meaningful impact on sector development, it must be engaged for the long term. In line&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
with the CAS, this means that the Bank must be in a position to offer policy advice and, to be&#13;
realistic, it must be combined with lending operations if the Bank is to have a significant impact&#13;
on policy improvements.  Our lending strategy will follow three stages. The first stage,&#13;
currently being implemented, covers the design of initial lending operations and constitutes the&#13;
Bank's re-entry into the sector. The initial round comprises five projects which aim to assist in&#13;
raising the quality of vocational and technical education, supporting the expansion and quality&#13;
improvement of secondary education in three strategic subjects - science, mathematics and&#13;
English and, under the proposed project, strengthening undergraduate science and engineering&#13;
programs in selected public universities. Such assistance would contribute to the production of&#13;
better-trained skilled workers, technicians, engineers and scientists, and better-educated outputs&#13;
from the secondary schools. This would address, directly, one of the critical development&#13;
problems in Thailand, namely, the severe shortages of technically skilled and educated&#13;
manpower.  Thus, proposed initial Bank assistance is fully consistent with Thailand's&#13;
development priorities and with the Bank's assistance strategy.&#13;
2.15         The second stage calls for the preparation of a policy-oriented sector study to be&#13;
completed by the Bank in FY97.  A number of sound education policies relating to system&#13;
expansion and quality improvement are currently being implemented and the five initial projects&#13;
would support these policies. These ongoing policies provide an adequate framework for the&#13;
effective implementation of the projects and for the sustainability of their outcomes.  With&#13;
respect to university science and engineering education, current policies (paras.1.33-1.37) call for&#13;
the expansion of enrollments in these fields to alleviate the shortage of scientists and engineers.&#13;
This would be accompanied by quality improvement measures to upgrade academic staff,&#13;
strengthen management and planning within faculties, expand the range of teaching programs&#13;
and upgrade teaching facilities. The design of the proposed project (paras. 3.5-3.9) is clearly&#13;
consistent with these policies.&#13;
2.16        However, in addition to current policies which are pursuing expansion and quality&#13;
improvement, there are a number of more complex policy issues which, administratively and&#13;
politically, are proving difficult to resolve. This difficulty is reflected in the fact that the issues&#13;
are well-known and regularly debated, but reaching a consensus aimed at their resolution has&#13;
eluded policy-makers to date.  The issues include: (a) University autonomy; diminishing&#13;
bureaucratic control accompanied by greater autonomy of institutional management and&#13;
academic freedom are desirable in a maturing higher education system such as Thailand's. A&#13;
measure of autonomy was granted to two new universities and it was planned to extend this to&#13;
other institutions, but progress has been delayed by the political process. (b) Cost recovery;&#13;
subsidy levels in public secondary schools and universities are high and benefit higher income&#13;
groups disproportionately. This needs to be redressed. (c) Role of the private sector; in order to&#13;
augment long-term resource flows to the education sector, the private sector must play a larger&#13;
role. This introduces a number of issues relating to incentives, high cost of entry, maintenance&#13;
of standards, overall level of regulation, etc. (d) Teacher retention; the rapidly expanding&#13;
private sector is attracting a significant number of teachers, especially those with technical and&#13;
scientific training. The magnitude of the problem needs to be defined, incentives for retention&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
introduced and a long-term strategy for teacher development formulated. The proposed sector&#13;
study, currently under preparation, is analyzing these (and other) issues and will propose&#13;
appropriate solutions."4&#13;
2.17        The sector study would form the basis of a policy dialogue with the Government,&#13;
which would be monitored during implementation of the ongoing projects. Recommendations&#13;
aimed at addressing major problems would be defined and set out in an education sector strategy.&#13;
This strategy would be prepared by the Government and would guide future improvements in&#13;
education. It would also serve to guide the policy content of future projects. Thus, the third&#13;
stage of Bank lending would encompass follow-up projects which would include policy content&#13;
drawn from the Government's sector strategy. It is expected that follow-up projects would&#13;
continue to support quality improvement in science and technical education. The unmet needs&#13;
are substantial and continued concentration of effort by the Bank would ensure that a meaningful&#13;
impact would be made in these areas. Project design would emphasize monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of policy improvements.&#13;
2.18        The Bank's strategy aims for long-term involvement in the education sector.&#13;
Through continued policy dialogue and carefully targeted lending operations, the Government&#13;
and the Bank would work towards a cost-effective, well-managed education system which would&#13;
meet the skill needs of an expanding economy and service the broader needs of a rapidly&#13;
modernizing society.  The initial projects are providing a way for the Bank to re-enter the&#13;
education sector and to address quickly some obvious needs for quality improvement within the&#13;
context of the existing policy framework. This would be accompanied by a policy dialogue,&#13;
based on sector work, which would analyze major problems and propose solutions.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Origin of the Project&#13;
3.1         In late 1993, the Government requested the Bank to examine the possibility of&#13;
project assistance to education. In conjunction with the Government, the Bank identified a&#13;
project which would assist in strengthening the quality of science and engineering education in&#13;
public universities Most of the preparation work was completed by the Government according to&#13;
guidelines formulated by the Bank. Project preparation was completed in November 1994 and&#13;
the project was appraised in May 1995. Project processing was delayed following elections in&#13;
July 1995 and the installation of a new Government. Further delay was caused by uncertainties,&#13;
now resolved, regarding the provision of technical assistance.&#13;
14    The sector study will: (a) define the broad objectives of the education system; (b) review education policies&#13;
and assess their effectiveness in achieving sector objectives; (c) analyze policy problems; (d) make policy&#13;
recommendations for major improvements in the education system; and (e) formulate a strategy for implementing&#13;
these recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
B. Project Background and Rationale&#13;
3.2          The education sector in Thailand is relatively well-endowed with resources,&#13;
education expenditures accounting for about 3.6% of GNP compared with the average for East Asia&#13;
of around 3%. Thus the Government has requested the Bank's assistance not primarily for the&#13;
resource transfer itself, but to ensure that priority needs are addressed through the efficient targeting&#13;
of resources and that value added is providedthroughprojectassistance. The proposed project is a&#13;
response to the request for assistance. There is widespread recognition in Thailand that the country&#13;
is facing a human resource constraint which must be addressed if high levels of economic growth&#13;
are to be sustained.'5 To maintain the present momentum in its development, Thailand must also&#13;
move up the technology chain to higher value added products as it loses its comparative advantage&#13;
in low-technology production. A key factor in this movement will be the ability of the universities&#13;
to produce well-trained engineers and scientists capable of handling the increasingly complex&#13;
production technologies necessary for the advancement of the industrial sector.'6 Current shortages&#13;
of scientists and engineers are being addressed through expanding enrollments in the universities&#13;
(para. 1.35). However, in a period of expansion, addressing problems of quality becomes&#13;
particularly important. The project provides the opportunity for the Bank to contribute to&#13;
improving the quality of science and engineering education in the 21 public universities.17 This&#13;
would result in the production of scientists and engineers who are better trained to handle rapidly&#13;
changing technologies in the productive sectors and this, in turn, would contribute to strengthening&#13;
the science and technology infrastructure which is vital to sustaining Thailand's long-term objective&#13;
of promoting technology-intensiveindustrialization.&#13;
3.3          The project is consistent with the Government's priority for developing technical&#13;
and scientific skills and with its plans for expanding and improving the quality of science and&#13;
engineering education (paras. 1.34-1.37). The project is also consistent with the Bank's country&#13;
assistance strategy (paras. 2.10-2.11) which identifies human resource development as one of the&#13;
key priorities. Regarding the latter, the CAS emphasizes the need to develop the capabilities of the&#13;
universities to provide quality science and engineering education. This is essential to providing the&#13;
human resource base for long-term technology-intensive industrialization. The project is also&#13;
consistent with the Bank's education lending strategy in Thailand (paras. 2.12-2.18). This calls for&#13;
the development of initial lending operations to make an early contribution in the crucial area of&#13;
quality improvement while leaving major policy changes to be identified in policy-oriented sector&#13;
work (scheduled for completion in FY97) and incorporated by the Government in an education&#13;
strategy (para. 2.17). This strategy would guide future improvements in education and also serve&#13;
as a guide to the policy content of future projects. The value added embodied in the proposed&#13;
Is "S&amp;T Manpower for Industries and Services: Demand and Supply projections", in Educational Options for the&#13;
FutureofThailand Vol. 11, The 1991 Year-EndConference,ThailandDevelopmentResearch Institute(Dec. 1991).&#13;
Ministry of University Affairs Long Term Plan for Higher Education (1990-2004).&#13;
17 The project would be complemented by a proposed Asian Development Bank project to assist undergraduate&#13;
science and engineering programs in private universities and graduate programs in selected public universities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
project lies, in part, in addressing immediate investment needs in the public universities thereby&#13;
helping to alleviate the backlog of investments in quality improvement in the strategic fields of&#13;
science and engineering. There is also value added in the Bank, working in partnership with MUA&#13;
and the universities, applying its rigorous project preparation techniques to identifying quality-&#13;
improving investments and in packaging them into a coherent project design, which can be&#13;
implemented efficiently.  Finally, value would be added through the Bank's assistance in&#13;
identifying needed policy changes and in supporting their implementation.&#13;
C. Project Objectives&#13;
3.4         The overall objective of the proposed project would be to improve the quality of&#13;
undergraduate science and engineering programs. Specifically, the project would aim to: (a)&#13;
strengthen the teaching capabilities of faculty; (b) upgrade the content of existing programs in&#13;
science and engineering and broaden the range of programs relevant to Thailand's technological&#13;
advancement; (c) modernize laboratories and strengthen their management; and (d) improve the&#13;
utilization of resources in faculties of engineering and science and establish a system for the large-&#13;
scale procurement of equipment.&#13;
D. Project Description&#13;
3.5         The project would support quality improvement in 21 public universities through&#13;
financing an institutional development program (baseline cost, US$16.4 million). This would&#13;
include; (a) short-term overseas training for selected academic and technical support staff in the&#13;
educational use and maintenance of the project-financed equipment (US$2.4 million); and (b)&#13;
technical assistance and academic support services (US$14 million), which would be financed by&#13;
the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), and provide consultant services to&#13;
evaluate existing programs and recommend new ones, improve the management of program&#13;
resources, develop effective procedures for the large-scale procurement of equipment and&#13;
strengthen project management. This component would also include the financing of small-scale&#13;
research projects which would extend the knowledge of academic staff relevant to improved&#13;
teaching and English language training for academic and technical staff selected for overseas&#13;
training. Teaching equipment (US$160 million) would be financed for undergraduate programs in&#13;
engineering (US$67 million) and science (US$93 million) together with installation costs estimated&#13;
at US$15.9 million. Incremental expenditures on equipment-related O&amp;M and consumable&#13;
materials (US$50.6 million) and project management support (US$2.lmillion) would also be&#13;
included in the project.&#13;
Institutional Development Program&#13;
3.6         To strengthen the teaching capabilities of selected academic staff, overseas&#13;
training (US$2.4 million) would be provided to expose academic staff to the latest developments&#13;
in their fields of specialization, including the use of new equipment, and to new teaching&#13;
techniques. Training would be concentrated mainly on junior academic staff who carry the major&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
teaching load within the faculties. The program would also include selected laboratory personnel to&#13;
strengthen management, equipment operations and maintenance within the science and engineering&#13;
laboratories. Training visits would average three months for 264 trainees - 189 from the science&#13;
faculties and 75 from engineering. Procedures for selecting candidates for training are well-&#13;
established in the universities and these would be utilized under the project. Consultant services&#13;
(US$9.0 million) would be provided under the project and financed by AusAID. These would&#13;
assist in: identifying and developing new undergraduate programs in science and engineering and&#13;
improving existing ones; preparing ecuipment lists and specifications; strengthening&#13;
procurement capacities in the universities and MUA; providing technical support and training in&#13;
the operation and maintenance of procured equipment; and improving the efficiency and&#13;
effectiveness of planning and management in the faculties of science and engineering. Assistance&#13;
would also be provided for strengthening project management and implementation. AusAID&#13;
would finance English language training (US$1.5 million) for candidates selected for overseas&#13;
training and more generally to allow staff to keep abreast of overseas developments in their&#13;
specializations. Undergraduate teaching would be further strengthenedthrough the financing of a&#13;
research program (US$3.5 million) which would provide funds for teaching staff to undertake&#13;
research relevant to their teaching responsibilities. The AusAID program is summarized in Annex&#13;
4.&#13;
Equipment&#13;
3.7         The equipment to be procured under the project in support of improving the&#13;
quality of undergraduate science and engineering programs (US$160 million) would be&#13;
distributed to 21 science faculties (US$93 million) and 15 engineering faculties (US$67 million).&#13;
The equipment would comprise a mix of advanced and basic items. Procurement of science&#13;
equipment would focus on modernizing laboratories for teaching the basic sciences (physics,&#13;
chemistry, biology, earth sciences) and mathematics. The supply of equipment would also&#13;
provide for the development of new programs to be identified with the assistance of consultants&#13;
(para. 3.6). For the engineering faculties, the equipment would be allocated to three categories:&#13;
(a) engineering faculties with obsolete laboratory equipment (5 faculties); (b) engineering&#13;
faculties of KMITs with rapid enrollment growth (3 faculties); and (c) new engineering faculties&#13;
(three in established universities and four in new ones). Physical facilities, in which project&#13;
equipment would be located, currently exist or are under construction. New facilities would be&#13;
completed in time for the installation of project-financed equipment. Installation costs estimated&#13;
at US$13 million would be financed under the project. Preliminary equipment lists and outline&#13;
specifications have been prepared with the assistance of a British-financed consultant. AusAID-&#13;
financed procurement experts would assist in the preparation of final equipment lists and&#13;
specifications and in the packaging of items for procurement.&#13;
Equipment-related 0 &amp; M&#13;
3.8         The project would finance US$50.6 million for equipment-related O&amp;M. This&#13;
investment would help to ensure that the equipment items would receive adequate supplies of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
consumable materials, spare parts, supplies and support services to ensure their effective&#13;
operation in the laboratories. It would also cover maintenance expenditures and the supply of&#13;
spare parts to keep the equipment in sound working order. Effective management of the supply&#13;
of consumables and equipment maintenance operations would be enhanced by the training of&#13;
laboratory personnel ( para. 3.6).&#13;
Project Management&#13;
3.9         The project would finance office facilities, including related equipment&#13;
(computers, fax machine, etc.), local consultants, support staff, temporary staff salaries and short-&#13;
term local and overseas training in management techniques for project implementation staff&#13;
(US$2.1 million).&#13;

Basis of Cost Estimates&#13;
4.2          Base costs are estimated at May 1996 prices. Estimates for the costs of equipment&#13;
and supplies/materials are based on current prices for similar imported or locally available items.&#13;
Costs for international and domestic consultants were calculated by AusAID and are consistent&#13;
with their cost estimates for appropriately qualified experts. Unit cost for overseas training for&#13;
academic staff and technicians is estimated at US$9,400 per trainee for short-term programs (3-&#13;
months).&#13;
4.3          Price contingencies of US$16.5 million (about 7%  of baseline costs) were&#13;
calculated for both local and foreign costs in accordance with the following expected annual&#13;
average price increase percentages: foreign cost, 2.3% in FY97 and thereafter and local cost,&#13;
4.5% p.a. throughout.&#13;
4.4          The foreign exchange component of US$164.0 million (representing 63% of total&#13;
project costs) has been calculated on the basis of the following foreign exchange percentages: (a)&#13;
equipment - 80%; (b) equipment installation - 36%; (c) equipment O&amp;M - 20%; (d) in-country&#13;
training - 10% and local consultants - 20%; and (e) foreign consultants and overseas training -&#13;
90%.&#13;
B. Financing&#13;
4.5          The proposed loan of US$143.4 million, to be disbursed over five and a half&#13;
years, would finance 55% of total cost and about 87% of the foreign cost of the project. AusAID&#13;
is providing a grant of US$14 million equivalent to parallel finance technical assistance for the&#13;
major part of the institutional development program. AusAID has selected a contractor through&#13;
competitive bidding, acceptable to the Bank, to implement its component and a contract has been&#13;
signed. Extemnal assistance would finance about 60% of total project cost and the Government&#13;
would be responsible for the remaining 40% or US$104.1.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
C. Project Management and Implementation&#13;
4.6       The Ministry of University Affairs (Chart 2) would have overall responsibility for&#13;
project implementation.  A  Project Coordinating Committee (PCC), responsible for the&#13;
coordination and general oversight of project activities, has been established and will be chaired by&#13;
the Permanent Secretary, MUA. The membership and terms of reference of the PCC are shown in&#13;
Annex 6. Detailed implementation of the project would be the responsibility of a Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU). The Deputy Permanent Secretary, MUA, would be the Director of the&#13;
PIU and a Project Manager would be responsible for day-to-day implementation activities. The&#13;
Policy and Planning Bureau (PPB) would serve as the Secretariat of the PCC. The PIU would be&#13;
organized into four functional units (FUs) responsible respectively for: (1) equipment procurement;&#13;
(2) planning and management of overseas training and coordination of consultants, data collection&#13;
and analysis, and the monitoring of key performance indicators; (3) accounting, financial aspects&#13;
and disbursements; and (4) general administration. Key staff of the functional units have been&#13;
identified and at project start-up, it is estimated that there will be 14 staff members in place. The&#13;
establishment of the PIU and its staffing with key personnel satisfactory to the Bank, would be a&#13;
condition of effectiveness.&#13;
4.7       The organization of project management is shown in Chart 3. The universities would&#13;
interface with the functional units for specific tasks. Thus on procurement matters, the universities'&#13;
procurement units would work with FU1, on overseas training and consultants coordination the&#13;
faculty selection panel would work with FU2. Accounting and disbursements would be handled by&#13;
FU3 and the universities' general administration divisions would work with FU4. The Australian&#13;
technical assistance contractor would work with the faculties of science and engineering, in close&#13;
coordination with MUA, on such matters as academic advisory services, fellowships, etc. and with&#13;
the faculties and FUI on procurement matters. The contractor would also advise the PIU on&#13;
project management. The project implementation schedule is given in Annex 7.&#13;
Status of Project Preparation&#13;
4.8         The advanced stage of project preparation would allow implementation to&#13;
commence immediately after loan effectiveness. Participating universities have been identified&#13;
and equipment lists and specifications prepared. Project management authorities have been&#13;
identified and competent staff are available to handle implementation activities. Implementation&#13;
arrangements, including those for coordination between project institutions, have been agreed.&#13;
The technical assistance contractor has been selected.&#13;
D. Monitoring and Review&#13;
4.9         Due to the relative complexity of the project and the MUA's lack of recent&#13;
experience with Bank-funded projects, above-average supervision coefficients of about 15 staff&#13;
weeks per year would be required in the first 2-3 years of project implementation. The Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
would supervise the project three times annually during the first 2-3 years of the project&#13;
implementation. It is expected that the remaining year would require two missions each year&#13;
with a third being scheduled only if necessary. The Government would provide status reports on&#13;
project implementation to supervision missions and submit an annual performance report to the&#13;
Bank by November 15 each year. The supervision missions would also monitor progress in&#13;
preparing the education sector policy study (paras. 2.14-2.15) and the policy dialogue between&#13;
the Bank and the Government, which would follow  from  the sector study.  Overall&#13;
implementation would be the responsibility of the task manager who would be assisted by a&#13;
procurement expert to handle equipment and an operations officer to oversee implementation of&#13;
the academic development program. The task manager would liaise with AusAID. The Resident&#13;
Mission. Bangkok would assist in project supervision. Annex 8 presents a Bank supervision plan&#13;
for the project.&#13;
4.10        Key performance indicators have been developed and were agreed during&#13;
negotiations. The indicators (Annex 9) would be utilized to monitor project performance and to&#13;
gain insight into project impact. They include the award of traineeships, course upgrading,&#13;
consultant recruitment and equipment supply. During negotiations, the Government agreed to&#13;
integrate the indicators into the overall monitoring system and use them systematically as part of&#13;
project supervision. The indicators may be modified and adjusted as implementation progresses.&#13;
During negotiations, the Government also provided assurances that, in conjunction with the&#13;
Bank, it would undertake an annual project implementation review, on the basis of the agreed&#13;
performance indicators, by January 15 in each year and carry out a mid-term review not later&#13;
than January 15. 2000.&#13;
E. Procurement 18&#13;
4.11        Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3. Equipment would be&#13;
grouped, to the greatest extent possible, in packages of US$200,000 or more (estimated value&#13;
US$143.5 million) for procurement under ICB utilizing standard bidding documents issued by&#13;
the Bank. Equipment packages in contracts estimated to cost less than US$200,000 may be&#13;
procured up to an aggregate limit of US$16.8 million through NCB procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank and the remaining amount (aggregate limit US$8.3 million) would be financed by the&#13;
Government following local procedures. Local equipment manufacturers would be extended a&#13;
margin of preference of 15% of the CIF price, or the prevailing customs duties, whichever is the&#13;
lower, on bid evaluation under ICB. Candidates for overseas training would be selected in&#13;
accordance with local procedures and operations and maintenance costs on equipment, including&#13;
supply of consumable materials, would also be procured by the Government under local&#13;
procedures. Consultant services would be procured in accordance with AusAID procedures. The&#13;
prior review threshold for equipment contracts financed by the Bank, is US$7.5 million, in line&#13;
with the regional prior review guidelines for Thailand. No equipment contract is expected to&#13;
I8 The Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", dated January 1995 will apply to&#13;
all goods procured under this Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
exceed the threshold amount, however the first three equipment contracts of each year of project&#13;
implementation would be reviewed by the Bank. Most of the equipment is expected to be&#13;
packaged in relatively large contracts and therefore it is estimated that about 80% of the value of&#13;
this procurement would be subject to prior review. About 10% of remaining contracts would be&#13;
subject to post review by supervision missions.&#13;

by the Ministry of University Affairs in respect of equipment contracts estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$7.5 million equivalent. Documentation would be retained by MUA and available for review&#13;
by the Bank during supervision missions. Administrative and accounting capability in MUA is&#13;
adequate to support the SOE procedure. Full documentation would be required by the Bank for&#13;
all contracts above US$7.5 million equivalent.  To the extent practicable, withdrawal&#13;
applications would be aggregated in amounts of US$200,000 or more prior to submission to the&#13;
Bank for reimbursement out of the proceeds of the loan. In view of the satisfactory budgetary&#13;
procedures and financing of Bank-assisted projects in Thailand, it was agreed to accept the&#13;
Government's preference not to establish a special account. The proposed Bank loan would be&#13;
disbursed over a period of 5.5 years (Annex 10) which is one year less than the standard&#13;
disbursement profile for Thailand (all sectors). The shorter period is justified by the strong&#13;
management and implementation capacity built into the project, the extensive technical&#13;
assistance to be provided in support of project management and procurement activities and the&#13;
Government's commitment to complete the project in five years. The completion date of the&#13;
project would be June 30, 2002, the closing date December 31, 2002.&#13;
G. Accounts, Audits and Reporting&#13;
4.14        The Government would cause the project institutions to maintain project accounts&#13;
in accordance with sound accounting practices. During negotiations, the Government gave&#13;
assurances that audited accounts, to be carried out by the Office of the Auditor General, would be&#13;
sent to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year. Audit reports would include a&#13;
separate opinion for expenditures under SOE procedures. The Government would also cause&#13;
each project institution to submit an annual progress report to the Bank. Within six months of&#13;
the closing date, an Implementation Completion Report would be prepared by the Bank in&#13;
cooperation with the Government.&#13;
H. Environmental Impact&#13;
4.15        The project would have no adverse impact on the environment. It would make a&#13;
positive environmental contribution through the production of better-trained scientists and&#13;
engineers, some of whom would be employed in environmental fields.&#13;
I. Project Sustainability&#13;
4.16        In view of the high priority the Government has accorded to the strengthening of&#13;
S&amp;T education, it is likely that the investments included under the project would be implemented&#13;
successfully and sustained in the longer term. The university system in Thailand is relatively well-&#13;
managed and adequately financed and this would reinforce the sustainability of project-financed&#13;
improvements in the participating universities. Furthermore, the Government has sought Bank&#13;
assistance on its own initiative because it values the Bank's ability to produce projects which are&#13;
soundly designed and properly focused on sectoral needs. This reinforces the view that the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
would be efficiently implemented and its benefits sustained in the long term. As noted previously&#13;
(paras. 2.15-2.16), the present education policy framework is adequate for the implementation of&#13;
the proposed project, although there are important longer-term policy problems to be addressed.&#13;
However, these problems would not adversely affect sustainability of the proposed project. They&#13;
will be addressed in the sector study and recommendations for their resolution will be implemented&#13;
in conjunction with future projects. The conclusions on sustainability are reinforced further by the&#13;
major emphasis being given to education in the Eighth Plan.&#13;
J. Economic and Institutional Analysis&#13;
4.17        The proposed project is linked to the labor market through its financing of quality&#13;
improvements in undergraduate science and engineering programs.    Thailand's rapid&#13;
development over the past two decades and especially the fast pace of industrialization has led to&#13;
significant shortages of engineers and scientists. This has led to high mobility and escalating&#13;
salaries. The Government's policies of expanding enrollments in science and engineering by&#13;
15% p.a. aim to overcome the shortages and their success will depend upon two crucial&#13;
achievements. First, the secondary schools must expand to supply the necessary inputs to the&#13;
university programs. This expansion is on target. Second, in a period of expansion special&#13;
attention needs to be given to maintaining, and preferably improving, quality.  Producing&#13;
increasing numbers of inadequately trained engineers and scientists will not benefit the country&#13;
in general and furthermore, will fail to sustain the large flows of foreign direct investment which&#13;
have fueled Thailand's industrialization. In turn this would retard Thailand's move up the&#13;
technology chain to higher value added technology intensive production. Thus the project's&#13;
focus on quality improvement will complement expansion plans in university science and&#13;
engineering programs.&#13;
4.18        The project is supporting the 21 public universities. The private university sector&#13;
plays an important role in Thailand and enrolls almost as many full-time students as the public&#13;
institutions. In recent years, enrollments in private universities have been growing more rapidly&#13;
than those in the public sector (paras. 1.4-1.5). The new loan fund for private universities (para.&#13;
1.36) will assist this expansion.&#13;
4.19          Raising the quality of university science and engineering programs requires a&#13;
combination of basic inputs - well-qualified teaching staff, well-equipped and managed&#13;
laboratories and well-balanced curricula. An extensive staff development program for graduate&#13;
study, mainly overseas, is being implemented by MUA (para. 1.24). The project complements&#13;
this program by providing selected teaching staff with practical training in the use of new&#13;
equipment and teaching techniques. Research funds are also being made available to staff to&#13;
conduct research relevant to their teaching responsibilities with a view to strengthening the&#13;
teaching function.  In the area of curriculum development, consultants are being financed to&#13;
review existing programs and recommend improvements, and also to identify new programs in&#13;
line with the needs of changing technology in the economy. Laboratories would be modernized&#13;
through the supply of up-to-date equipment and improved management and technical services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
4.20          Para. 4.16 indicated that project outcomes are likely to be sustained from the&#13;
general perspective of the priority being accorded to the development of science and technology&#13;
education. In addition, there is an element of financial sustainability to be considered in the form&#13;
of the incremental recurrent costs generated by the project. These relate mainly to expenditures&#13;
for equipment-related O&amp;M and consumables. The annual recurrent cost burden generated by&#13;
the project when it is fully operational is estimated at US$11.6 million thus averaging about&#13;
US$0.5 million per institution. This amounts to less than 1% of the average annual budget&#13;
expenditures per institution.  These additional expenditures could be accommodated by the&#13;
institutions without difficulty.&#13;
4.21        Regarding institutional capacity to support the project, careful attention has been&#13;
given to the ability of MUA to implement the project in view of its lack of experience with Bank&#13;
operations.  A strong Project Coordinating Committee has been established, chaired by the&#13;
Deputy Permanent Secretary, MUA, to provide coordination and general oversight of project&#13;
activities. A well-staffed PIU would be responsible for detailed implementation and additional&#13;
specialist staff from MUA would be made available to the PIU if needed. In view of the large&#13;
amount of equipment to be procured under the project, special attention has been given to the&#13;
planning and management of procurement. Consultants financed by AusAID will assist in all&#13;
aspects of the procurement process including the introduction of relevant computer software. It&#13;
is intended that the consultants will assist in establishing a permanent procurement capacity&#13;
within MUA to handle large-scale procurement tasks in future projects. A detailed equipment&#13;
procurement plan is being prepared by the Australian technical assistance contractor.&#13;
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
5.1         Through improving the quality of undergraduate science and engineering programs,&#13;
the project would result in the supply of better-trained scientists and engineers to industry. This&#13;
would enhance industry's capacity to handle more advanced production technologies and in general&#13;
strengthen the movement towards more technology-intensive production. Faculty enrichment&#13;
through overseas training and the employment of visiting academic advisers, would enhance the&#13;
capacity of the faculties of science and engineering to keep abreast of the latest developments in&#13;
subject matter and also strengthen their ability to promote new programs in advanced fields. The&#13;
long-term result would be an enhanced capacity for Thailand to achieve technology-intensive&#13;
industrialization.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
5.2            The main risk associated with the project concerns the implementation capacity&#13;
of MUA and the universities, which have joint responsibility for project implementation. Staff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
have not had experience with Bank implementation procedures and special attention has therefore&#13;
been given to setting up and maintaining a strong project implementation capacity. In view of the&#13;
large number of participating institutions, emphasis has also been given to the overall coordination&#13;
of project activities. The risk would be mitigated further by the employment of project&#13;
management and procurement advisers under the technical assistance component, through the&#13;
allocation of additional resources to project supervision in the early years of implementationand by&#13;
means of the annual reviews of implementationperformance.&#13;
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
6.1       The Government has agreed that:&#13;
(a) in conjunction with the Bank, the Government would undertake a review&#13;
of project progress by January 15 in each year based on agreed&#13;
performance indicators which had been integrated into the overall monitoring&#13;
system (para.4. 10).&#13;
(b) a mid-term review would be held a the end of the third year and would include&#13;
an overall assessment of implementation experience to date and also include&#13;
discussions on the structure of a possible follow-up project (para. 4. 10).&#13;
(c) audited accounts of the project, including a separate opinion for expenditures&#13;
under SOE procedures, would be sent to the Bank within six months of the end&#13;
of each fiscal year (para. 4.14).&#13;
6.2         The condition of effectiveness is that the PIU would be established and staffed&#13;
with key personnel satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.6).&#13;
6.3        Subject to the above conditions, the project constitutes a suitable basis for a fixed&#13;
rate US dollar single currency Bank loan of US$143.4 million to Thailand for a term of 15 years,&#13;
including 3 years of grace.&#13;

THAILAND&#13;
UNIVERSITIES SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
ACCREDITATION OF B. ENGINEERING DEGREE PROGRAMS&#13;
The accreditation practice has a basis similar to the US Accreditation Board for&#13;
Engineering and Technology , where the various engineering professional societies set&#13;
periodically the desired distribution of semester hour credits among the basic&#13;
sciences/mathematics, engineering sciences.&#13;
In Thailand, before a university opens an engineering undergraduate program, the&#13;
curriculum and study program proposed by the concerned department are submitted first to the&#13;
Committee of University Deans examine their implications on other departments and/or faculties&#13;
of the university and, subsequently, to the University Council for assessment of budgetary&#13;
implications and approval. The final documents are then presented both to the MUA and the&#13;
Ministry of the Interior. At the MUA the documents are scrutinized, guided by a number of&#13;
earlier decrees and regulations to ensure that the proposal meets the credentials required for a&#13;
university degree.&#13;
The Ministry of the Interior is vested with the authority to issue professional registration&#13;
that grants license to sign engineering contracts, undertake construction and operation of&#13;
projects, plants and equipment above defined capacities. Six engineering professions are listed&#13;
as requiring registration, these include: civil (including structural, sanitary and environmental),&#13;
mechanical  (including  automotive),  electrical  (including  power,  computer  and&#13;
telecommunications), industrial (including production), mining and chemical engineering. The&#13;
Ministry of Interior has delegated this responsibility to the Engineering Institute of Thailand as&#13;
the professional certification council. Each of the professional societies represented in the&#13;
Engineering Institute lay down the desired curriculum requirements and professional experience.&#13;
Consequently, the proposal from a university engineering department initiating an undergraduate&#13;
degree program is examined by the respective professional society, which may suggest&#13;
modifications if exemptions are to be granted to holders of that engineering degree program from&#13;
sitting at the examinations held by the professional society for grant of the professional&#13;
registration. This grant of exemption is eagerly sought, and nearly 70-80 percent of the&#13;
engineering curricula in the public universities are in match with the professional societies'&#13;
requirements, that are modified periodically to keep step with the changing state of the&#13;
profession.&#13;

UNIVERSITIES SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM&#13;
I. Planning and Management&#13;
1.          Planned development of Science and Engineering education institutions,&#13;
programs, management and staff resources.&#13;
The Government is supporting many developments and sets of inputs to improve&#13;
science and engineering education in Thailand universities. The project will work to enhance the&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of planning and management. The work to be undertaken will&#13;
involve Australian advisory inputs and experiential workshops to identify problems, options and&#13;
possible directions for development.  Particular skills in management, such as program&#13;
budgeting, will be developed as required.&#13;
The activities undertaken will include:&#13;
(a)   Advisory services on planning for institution, course and program development:&#13;
A long term Adviser (also Team Leader) will consult with MUA and university&#13;
staff, as requested, on planning, development and management of Science and&#13;
Engineering education programs in Thailand. The Adviser will be assisted by a&#13;
locally employed Academic and Research Liaison Officer. In addition short-term&#13;
Advisers will be provided to assist with particular problems or issues;&#13;
(b)   Annual workshop on development of Science and Engineering education in&#13;
Thailand: An annual workshop involving MUA officials, senior university staff,&#13;
Australian consultants and Australian and World Bank officials;&#13;
(c)   Workshops on management of resources in higher education institutions&#13;
concerned with Science and Engineering education: Workshops in&#13;
Australia will be provided for: (i) senior university staff and, separately, and (ii)&#13;
Deans of Science and Engineering. The workshops will enable these key&#13;
personnel to observe different financial and management systems and to&#13;
undertake on-ground experience in new approaches.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
(Page 2 of 13)&#13;
Inputs&#13;
One long-term Adviser (48 person months), one Academic and Liaison Officer&#13;
(48 person months) and 4 short-term Advisers. Provision is made for the costs&#13;
of a major workshop each year on Science and Engineering education developments. There is&#13;
also provision for two sets of in-Australia workshops on planning and management.&#13;
2.          Planned development of Science and Engineering education facilities, equipment&#13;
and technical support services.&#13;
The project will involve the procurement of approximately US$160 million worth&#13;
of equipment for undergraduate Science and Engineering education. This will require the&#13;
establishment of a Project Implementation Unit in MUA. This will involve the development of&#13;
specifications to meet requirements of Thai university staff and of procurement procedures to&#13;
meet World Bank and Government requirements. The Australian inputs will contribute to the&#13;
development of these systems, procedures and staff. They will also contribute to the successful&#13;
completion of the procurement and establishment of the equipment. MUA is not presently&#13;
involved in procurement for universities, which handle such procurement themselves. However,&#13;
the nature of the Bank project, Bank and the Government procedures under this project mean that&#13;
a central procurement system will be established. Australian assistance can help development&#13;
and implementation of a workable system that maintains university autonomy.&#13;
The activities undertaken will include:&#13;
Technical support resources. The Procurement Adviser and short-term experts&#13;
will work with MUA staff in the Project Implementation unit of the World Bank&#13;
project to develop a procurement system which meets university specification of&#13;
requirements and World Bank and the Government procedures for tendering and&#13;
cost effectiveness. Some in-Australia study visits will be arranged for staff.&#13;
3.          Improved capabilities of technicians and technical support staff in Science and&#13;
Engineering. Technical support to operate and maintain equipment is a continuing problem.&#13;
Some technical staff positions are now available but personnel have limited prior training and&#13;
basically learn by trial and error on the job. This limits the effective use of equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

IV. Collaborative Research&#13;
1.           Capabilities in formulating and presenting research proposals&#13;
The research culture is not well developed in Thai universities, particularly in&#13;
Engineering. The quality of both teaching and research suffers as a&#13;
result. Some key people suggest that because of a braindrain to the private sector and&#13;
commitments to more remunerative activities, the quantity and quality of research is actually&#13;
declining. The Government through the new Thailand Research Fund and through incentives to&#13;
industry is endeavoring to provide funds for research activities. However, motivation, interest&#13;
and experience need to be developed to fully utilize these new resources. Collaborative research&#13;
involving Thai and Australian academics are one way of developing an emphasis on research.&#13;
This can involve small research grants or large collaborative research projects. The first step is&#13;
to develop skills in defining research projects and in writing for project funding.&#13;
The activities undertaken will include:&#13;
(a)   Workshops on proposal preparation and presentation, involving technical and&#13;
English language training: These workshops will be held to develop special skills&#13;
in identifying research problems and projects and in writing effective applications&#13;
for research support. Workshops may also cover research management issues.&#13;
Activities would involve both technical and English language development.&#13;

V. English Language Training for Science and Engineering&#13;
1.          Improved ESP teaching for Science and Engineering in Thai universities&#13;
Both staff and students in Science and Engineering require English language skills&#13;
to enable them to take opportunities for overseas contacts or scholarships and to keep up with&#13;
international developments in Science and Engineering. For staff, the opportunities may be in&#13;
Thailand or overseas. They may involve on-the-job staff development, upgrading of academic&#13;
qualifications or collaborative research. Many staff will seek scholarship training overseas, and&#13;
find limited English a major stumbling block in taking up such opportunities. the project can&#13;
provide support for early English language leaming and for predeparture English for staff who&#13;
will use their scholarships to go to Australia. ELT can also be integrated into other Science and&#13;
Engineering staff development components.&#13;
For students, there are already English language subjects in all undergraduate&#13;
Science and Engineering programs. Students need better English language skills to gain access&#13;
to the best access to the best employment opportunities or pursue further study. With better&#13;
focused ESP activities, the time spent on English language learning can be more productive.&#13;
The activities undertaken will include:&#13;
(a)   Advisory services to Thai universities on course and program development for&#13;
courses in ESP for Science and Engineering staff and students.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The Australian Adviser will provide professional ESP training needs&#13;
analysis, advice on integrated ESP teaching activities, facilitation and&#13;
coordination of all ELT activities in the project. A Thai counterpart will work&#13;
with the Adviser for a period and then continue to provide advice and&#13;
coordination in ELT activities.&#13;
(b)   Needs Analysis of ELT for working with Australian Science and Engineering&#13;
Experts: In the first year a series of workshops will be run for Science and&#13;
Engineering staff to identify skill gaps and increase their&#13;
language skills and awareness for working with Australian advisers and experts.&#13;
Other workshops will be held on specific skill areas in later years.&#13;

            Engineering Education Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of the
            Universities Science and Engineering Education Project is to
            improve the quality of undergraduate science and engineering
            programs.  Specifically, the project aims to: a) strengthen
            faculty teaching capabilities; b) upgrade the existing
            science and engineering program content and broaden the
            range of programs relevant to Thailand's technological
            advancement; c) modernize laboratories and strengthen their
            management; and d) improve resource utilization in
            engineering and science faculties and establish a system for
            large-scale equipment procurement.  The project will support
            quality improvement in public universities through financing
            an institutional development program which will include: a)
            short term overseas training for selected academic and
            technical support staff in the educational use and
            maintenance of the project-financed equipment; and b)
            technical assistance and academic support services which
            will provide consultant services to evaluate existing
            programs and recommend new ones, improve the program
            resource management, develop effective procedures for large
            scale equipment procurement and strengthen project
            management.  This component will also include small-scale
            research projects financing for academic and technical staff
            selected for overseas training.  Teaching equipment will be
            financed for undergraduate programs together with
            installation costs.  Incremental expenditure on equipment
            related operation  and maintenance, consumable material, and
            project management support will also be included in the project.
