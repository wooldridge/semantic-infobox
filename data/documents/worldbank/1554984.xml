INDUSTRIAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES&#13;
This paper subjects two, conflicting, claims to scrutiny. For one thing,&#13;
it has been alleged that increases in the import of manufactured goods from&#13;
the developing countries have adversely affected the industrial sector in the&#13;
developed countries and that the continuation of these trends bodes ill for&#13;
the future of the sector. For another thing, it has been suggested that&#13;
growing protectionism in the developed countries has compromised the prospects&#13;
for an outward-oriented industrial strategy in the developing countries and&#13;
makes it necessary for these countries to turn to domestic markets or to trade&#13;
among themselves.&#13;
It is shown in the paper that trade in manufactured goods with the&#13;
developing countries benefited the developed countries by increasing demand&#13;
for their products at a time of low capacity utilization as well as through&#13;
specialization according to comparative advantage. The developed countries&#13;
will derive further gains from the future expansion of this trade, estimated&#13;
by the author for the 1978-90 period on the assumption of the continuation of&#13;
present trade policies. At the same time, under the assumptions made, the&#13;
rapid growth of manufactured exports of the developing countries would&#13;
continue.&#13;
It has also been alleged that obtaining long-term gains through&#13;
international specialization in manufactures entails a considerable cost of&#13;
adjustment in the developed countries. The paper provides evidence that these&#13;
fears have been much exaggerated. For one thing, manufactured trade between&#13;
developed and developing countries increasingly involves intra-industry&#13;
specialization that has a low adjustment cost. For another thing, the&#13;
transferability of skills in various occupational categories limit the cost of&#13;
adjustment in inter-industry specialization and this cost can be further&#13;
reduced through retraining and early retirement provisions.&#13;
On the basis of these considerations, the author suggests lowering rates&#13;
of industrial protection in the developed countries. This would involve,&#13;
among other things, transforming the Multifiber Arrangement from an instrument&#13;
of protection to one of adjustment. The author further suggests instituting&#13;
an international safeguard code to smooth the process of adjustment to freer&#13;
trade in the developed countries.&#13;

INDUSTRIAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES&#13;
Bela Balassa&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The growth of the developed countries' imports of manufactured goods&#13;
from the developing countries has received much attention in recent years. It&#13;
has been alleged that increases in imports have adversely affected the indus-&#13;
trial sector of the developed countries and that the continuation of this trend&#13;
bodes ill for the future of the sector.l/ In turn, it has been claimed that&#13;
growing protectionism in the developed countries has compromised the prospects&#13;
for an outward-oriented industrial strategy in the developing countries and&#13;
makes it necessary for these countries to turn to domestic markets or to trade&#13;
among themselves.&#13;
The present paper will subject these, conflicting,claims to scrutiny.&#13;
It will examine recent changes in the pattern of international specialization&#13;
in manufactured goods and consider their impact on the industrial sector of the&#13;
developed countries. The protectionist measures,applied by these countries and&#13;
their effects on international trade flows will also be analyzed.&#13;
The paper will further review the prospects for manufacturing trade&#13;
and for industrial growth in the developed countries. This will be followed&#13;
by a discussion of the possibilities for intra-industry trade between&#13;
developed and developing countries, and of the implications this trade&#13;
has for the process of adjustment in the developed countries. Finally, desirable&#13;

policy changes in the developed countries will be briefly considered.&#13;
I. Changing Patterns of Trade in Manufactured Goods between&#13;
Developed and Developing Countries&#13;
Manufacturing Trade and Growth in the Developed Countries, 1963-1978&#13;
The 1963-73 period was characterized by rapid industrial expansion&#13;
in the developed countries. Manufacturing output rose at an average annual&#13;
rate of 5.4 percent, exceeding the GDP growth rate of 4.6 percent. The volume&#13;
of manufactured imports from the developing countries grew even faster,&#13;
averaging 16 percent a year in volume terms. Starting from a low base, these&#13;
imports reached $15.1 billion in 1973, accounting for 19 percent of the total&#13;
exports of the developing countries including, and 32 percent excluding,&#13;
fuels.-/ Nevertheless, they barely exceeded one percent of the value of&#13;
manufacturing production in the developed countries.&#13;
With slow recovery following the world recession of 1974-75, the&#13;
rate of growth of GDP in the industrial countries averaged 2.5 percent, and&#13;
that of manufacturing output 2.2 percent, between 1973 and 1978. At the same&#13;
time, imports of manufactured goods from the developing countries continued to&#13;
increase rapidly, with their rate of growth averaging 10.2 percent a year.&#13;
These figures should not be interpreted, however, as evidence that&#13;
trade in manufactured goods with the developing countries had adverse effects on&#13;
developed country industries. This is because their increased export&#13;
earnings permitted the developing countries to increase their purchases of&#13;
manufactured goods from the developed countries. In fact, financed in part by&#13;

defined to exclude Southern Europe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

foreign borrowing, the exports of manufactured goods from the developed&#13;
countries to the developing countries grew more than their imports. The&#13;
dollar value of these exports more than tripled, from $52 billion in 1973&#13;
to $159 billion in 1978, while imports increased from $16 billion to&#13;
$44 billion. As a result, the export surplus of the developed countries in&#13;
trade in manufactured goods with the developing countries rose from $36 billion&#13;
to $115 billion, accounting for 3.7 percent of manufacturing output in the&#13;
developed countries in 1978. In the same year, the share of manufactured&#13;
exports to, and imports from,the developing countries in domestic output was&#13;
5.1 percent and 1.4 percent r             l/&#13;
,,espectively.-&#13;
One can thus reject the contention that trade in manufactured goods&#13;
with the developing countries would have adversely affected industrial growth&#13;
in the developed countries. Rather, given the existence of unused capacity in&#13;
these countries during the period under consideration, their rising export&#13;
surplus in trade in manufactured goods raised the level of their industrial output,&#13;
both directly and indirectly through its multiplier effects. And, developed&#13;
countries further enjoyed the benefits of increased specialization according to&#13;
comparative advantage that provided gains to both groups of countries.&#13;
The explanation of the slow growth of industrial output in the&#13;
developed countries lies elsewhere. To begin with, the adverse effects of&#13;
the quadrupling of oil prices aggravated the recession that was to follow the&#13;

Development, March 1981.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
1972-73 boom. The parallel application of deflationary policies by&#13;
countries further deepened the recession and slowed the subsequent recovery.-/&#13;
Finally, the growth of the public sector, the increased scope of government&#13;
regulations, as well as fiscal and social measures that tend to discourage&#13;
work effort, risk-taking, savings and investment, adversely affected the growth&#13;
of their manufacturing output.&#13;
Protectionist Actions by the Developed Countries&#13;
The question needs further to be answered if increased protectionism&#13;
in the developed countries has adversely affected the imports of manufactured&#13;
goods from the developing countries. In fact, in the wake of the oil crisis&#13;
and the world recession, protectionist actions multiplied and assumed new&#13;
forms, including non-tariff measures, such as import quotas, orderly market-&#13;
ing arrangements, 'voluntary' export restraints, and countervailing actions,&#13;
as well as government aids and efforts made to establish international&#13;
cartels. Government aids might have been provided purportedly for adjustment&#13;
assistance but, more often than not, they in effect supported the industry&#13;
against import competition.2/&#13;
Protectionist actions against developing countries culminated in&#13;
1977 when European countries again experienced a recession and the U.S.&#13;
balance of payments deteriorated as a result. The process has not continued&#13;
and, in some respects, it has been reversed in subsequent years, however. This&#13;
will be apparent if we consider changes in tariff and nontariff measures, govern-&#13;

"The Tokyo Round and the Developing Countries," ibid., March-April, 1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ment aids, and cartel-type arrangements.&#13;
To begin with, the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations&#13;
has been brought to completion. It has involved an average one-third tariff&#13;
reduction on industri-al products of interest to the developing countries as&#13;
well as agreemeption several codes of non-tariff measures, with the significant&#13;
exception of the code of safeguards. Of particular importance is the introduc-&#13;
tion of an injury.test in U.S. legislation on countervailing action; previously&#13;
countervailing duties were imposed in the event of export subsidization abroad,&#13;
irrespective of wnether there had been injury to domestic industry.&#13;
The developing countries have further benefited from more liberal&#13;
treatment in the application of escape clauses in the United States and the&#13;
increased use of tariffs in the place of import restrictions in the few cases&#13;
when escape clause actions have been taken against them. Also, since 1977,&#13;
there have been fewer instances of safeguard measures being used against&#13;
developing countries in Western Europe. Last but not least, Japan has&#13;
liberalized imports, favorably affecting in particular the imports of&#13;
manufactured goods from the developing countries.&#13;
Following the proliferation of government aids to industry in the&#13;
years following the oil crisis, some changes in the opposite direction have&#13;
occurred in this respect also. After the Spring 1978 parliamentary elections,&#13;
the government of Raymond Barre has announced its intention to reduce the scope&#13;
of government aids to industry in France and the government of Margaret Thatcher&#13;
has subsequently introduced a similar program in Britain. It also appears that&#13;
government intervention is on the decline in Japan, and the Reagan Adminstration&#13;
is not likely to pursue the interventionist strategy proposed under the heading&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
"re-industrialization" by Jimmy Carter.&#13;
At the same time, France has ceased to promote its earlier proposal&#13;
for world-wide organized trade and the defeat of Commissioner Etienne Davignon's&#13;
scheme for the establishment of a synthetic fiber cartel in the European&#13;
Common Market has discouraged attempts to set up cartels in other'industries.&#13;
Finally, efforts made to establish shipbuilding and steel cartels in the&#13;
framework of the OECD have met with little success.&#13;
The easing of protectionist pressures after 1977 has contributed to&#13;
the acceleration of the growth of the developed countries' imports of manufac-&#13;
tured goods from the developing countries. While the volume of these imports&#13;
grew by only 7.6 percent in 1977, the increase was 15.5 percent in 1978. A&#13;
further increase of 26 percent in terms of dollar value occurred in 1979 that&#13;
may be translated into a volume increase of about 16 percent.&#13;
Furthermore, although the more restrictive rules on textiles&#13;
and clothing imports from the developing countries adopted in the course of&#13;
the 1977 revision of the Multifiber Arrangement have remained in effect, after&#13;
stagnation in 1977 the imports of textiles and clothing from the developing&#13;
countries have risen again. The increase was 25 percent in 1978 and 23&#13;
percent in 1979 in terms of dollar value, corresponding to a rise of 8-9&#13;
percent and 7-8 percent, respectively, in volume terms.&#13;
These conclusions should not give rise to undue optimism, since&#13;
protectionist forces in the developed countries remain strong. Nevertheless,&#13;
it is noteworthy that the 1980 recession has not brought an aggravation of&#13;
protectionist tendencies against the developing countries as it had been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
feared. Rather, the fire of the protectionists has been directed against&#13;
other developed countries that can better defend their interests than the&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
Once economic expansion in the developed countries is again under&#13;
way, the time may be propitious for a further assault on protectionism.&#13;
Suggestions to this effect will be made in the concluding section of the&#13;
paper. In the following, prospective trends in trade in manufactured goods&#13;
will be examined on the assumption that the trade policies presently applied&#13;
in the developed countries will continue during the period under consideration.&#13;
Projections for 1978-1990 V&#13;
The author has projected the developed countries' imports of&#13;
manufactured goods from the developing countries for the 1978-90 period for&#13;
the case that present trade policies, including the Multifiber Arrangement,&#13;
continue. It has further been assumed that the gross national product of the&#13;
developed countries would rise at an average annual rate of 3.9 percent between&#13;
1978 and 1990 and that their income elasticity of import demand for manufactured&#13;
goods originating in the developing countries would be 3.2 during this period.&#13;
This elasticity is lower than the estimated income elasticity of 4.1 in the&#13;
1973-78 period, reflecting the view that developing countries would obtain&#13;
smaller relative gains from the higher absolute level of exports reached in&#13;
1978.&#13;
In turn, it has been assumed that income elasticities of import demand&#13;
for manufactured goods originating in the developed countries would be 2.0 in&#13;

OPEC and 1.5 in non-OPEC developing countries, representing a decline from&#13;
the observed income elasticities of 3.0 and 1.8, respectively, in the 1973-78&#13;
period. With projected GNP growth rates of 6.0 percent and 5.5 percent,&#13;
averaging 5.6 percent, the exports of manufactured goods from the developed&#13;
countries to the developing countries would rise at an average annual rate&#13;
of 9.7 percent between 1978 and 1990 as compared to projected increases of&#13;
12.5 percent in their imports.&#13;
Notwithstanding the higher rate of import growth,the projections&#13;
would entail an increase in the export surplus of the developed countries in&#13;
their trade in manufactured goods with the developing countries from $115&#13;
billion in 1978 to $374 billion in 1990, expressed in terms of 1978 prices.&#13;
This increase would contribute to industrial growth in the developed countries,&#13;
raising the rate of growth of production (3.9 percent), above that of consumption&#13;
(3.6 percent), of manufactured goods.&#13;
At the same time, the developing countries would become increasingly&#13;
important markets for the manufactured products of the developed countries,&#13;
accounting for 18 percent of the increment in production, and for 59 percent of&#13;
the increment in exports to non-partner countries, between 1978 and 1990. In&#13;
the same period, the developing countries would provide 9 percent of the&#13;
increment in the developed countries' consumption of manufactured goods and&#13;
45 percent of the increment of their imports from non-partner countries.-/&#13;
1/ Trade with non-partner countries excludes U.S.-Canada trade that takes&#13;
place largely in the framework of multinational corporations and one-third&#13;
of which is not subject to duty under the North American Automotive Agree-&#13;
ment, as well as trade among the member countries of the European free&#13;
trade area in manufactured goods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
The developed countries would benefit from the growth of international&#13;
trade in manufactured goods with the developing countries through specializa-&#13;
tion according to comparative advantage, entailing the expansion of&#13;
industries embodying sophisticated technology, high-level manpower, and physical&#13;
capital. Still, this pattern of specialization would not involve a decline in out-&#13;
put in any of the eight industrial categories for which separate projections&#13;
have been made.&#13;
In particular, rates of growth of the imports of textiles and clothing&#13;
of 6 percent and 7 percent, projected under the assumption of the continued&#13;
operation of the Mfultifiber Arrangement, would permit production in these&#13;
industries of the developed countries to continue to rise. For the 1978-90&#13;
period, production in the developed countries is projected to increase at&#13;
average annual rates of growth of 2.2 percent for textiles and 2.5 percent&#13;
for clothing.&#13;
II. Intra-industry Trade in Manufactured Goods&#13;
between Developed and Developing Countries&#13;
Inter-industry vs. Intra-industry Specialization&#13;
Following the traditional discourse on the effects of trade between&#13;
developed and developing countries, the above discussion has been couched in&#13;
terms of inter-industry specialization that concerns the allocation of resources&#13;
among industries. In this section, the possibilities for intra-industry special-&#13;
ization in trade in manufactured goods between developed and developing countries&#13;
will be considered.&#13;
Following a paper by the author on the effects of trade Ilberalization&#13;
in the European Common Market,-/ considerable attention was given to intra-&#13;

Countries," American Economic Review, June, 1966.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
industry trade among the developed countries. This trade may involve&#13;
horizontal specialization through the exchange of differentiated products,&#13;
as well as vertical specialization through trade in parts, components, and&#13;
accessories of a particular product.&#13;
Intra-industry trade was said to occur among countries at similar&#13;
levels of development that have similar relative factor prices. Empirical&#13;
research also dealt with intra-industry trade among such countries,&#13;
first in developed areas and, subsequently, in developing regions. This&#13;
orientation of theoretical and empirical research was confirmed by contri-&#13;
butions to the recent Symposium on intra-industry trade.-/&#13;
At the Symposium, the author further addressed himself to intra-&#13;
industry trade between developed and developing countries. He suggested&#13;
that "horizontal specialization will also occur among countries at different&#13;
levels of development, when the product varieties traded will incorporate&#13;
attributes that correspond to the factor endowments of the countries concerned."-&#13;
Drawing on earlier work on subcontracting, he also noted the existence of&#13;
vertical specialization between developed and developing countries in the&#13;
framework of the international division of the production process.-/ In&#13;
the following, empirical evidence will be provided on the extent of horizontal&#13;
and vertical specialization between the two groups of countries, further&#13;
indicating its implications for the process of adjustment in the developed&#13;
countries.&#13;

directed by Joseph Grunwald of the Brookings Institution, "North-South&#13;
Complementary Intra-Industry Trade" which examines various forms of vertical&#13;
specialization and the economic effects of international subcontracting in&#13;
selected Latin American countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Horizontal Specialization&#13;
The U.S. textiles and clothing industry provides a case study of&#13;
horizontal (product) specialization.l/ As an introduction to the&#13;
discussion, reference may be made to the employment effects of productivity&#13;
growth and of changes in trade flows since 1977, the year when the industry&#13;
mounted a protectionist campaign.&#13;
The data of Table 1 indicate that, in their impact on employment,&#13;
the growth of labor productivity much dominated changes in trade flows.&#13;
Whereas productivity growth was responsible for the loss of 71 thousand jobs&#13;
in textiles and 105 thousand jobs in clothing between 1977 and 1979, changes&#13;
in trade flows led to a gain of 14 thousand jobs in textiles and to a loss of&#13;
17 thousand jobs in clothing.&#13;
The results do not confirm the fears expressed as to the adverse&#13;
effects of imports on employment in the U.S-. textiles and clothing industry.&#13;
At the same time, the aggregate data do not permit gauging the welfare gains&#13;
obtained through product specialization in the industry. Evidence on the&#13;
existence of these gains is provided by differences in unit values in domestic&#13;
production and in imports.&#13;
In 1979, average unit values calculated per pound of fiber equiva-&#13;
lent were $7.47 in U.S. production and $4.70 in imports.-/ This result is the&#13;
outcome of a process in which the shift of domestic industry to more sophisti-&#13;
cated products with higher value added is accompanied by the growth of imports&#13;
of relatively simple products that have low value added.&#13;

Chapter 35, Apparel, p. 368.&#13;
Notes:&#13;
(a) Domestic price increase was assumed to apply to imports and exports.&#13;
(b) Expected net imports were calculated on the assumption that their 1975 share&#13;
in apparent consumption remained unchanged in subsequent years.&#13;
(c) Differences between actual and expected net imports.&#13;
(d) Hypothetical employment was calculated on the assumption that 1975 levels&#13;
of output per man remained unchanged in subsequent years.&#13;
(e) Employment loss due to productivity increases equals the difference between&#13;
hypothetical and actual employment.&#13;
(f) Employment loss due to excess of net imports is calculated by dividing the&#13;
excess of net imports by the 1977 level of output per man. The employment&#13;
effects of change in the net imports of man-made fiber have been calculated&#13;
in the same way.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
The process of upgrading may involve shifts between products made&#13;
from different materials or between products made from the same material.&#13;
To begin with, man-made fibers have increasingly gained at the expense of&#13;
cotton in the United States. Expressed in terms of linear yards, the production&#13;
of cotton broadwoven fabrics fell from 6.3 billion in 1970 to 4.4 billion in&#13;
1977 and to 3.9 billion in 1979; in the same period, the production of&#13;
man-made fiber fabrics rose from 4.9 billion to 6.3 billion and, again, to&#13;
6.6 billion.l/&#13;
Furthermore, among cotton broadwoven fabrics, shifts have occurred&#13;
from lower value-added sheeting, duck, and print cloth to higher value-added&#13;
cotton fabrics and, in particular, to corded colored yarn fabrics. As a&#13;
result of these shifts, the share of the former group of fabrics in the total&#13;
declined from 70.5 percent in 1970 to 57.0 percent in 1977 and it stabilized&#13;
at that level afterwards.&#13;
Finally, within the duck, sheeting, and print cloth category, there&#13;
has been a shift towards finer fabrics in the U.S. industry. The existence&#13;
of this shift is indicated by the higher unit values of U.S. production and,&#13;
in particular, exports as compared to imports. In 1979, export and import&#13;
unit values, respectively, were $0.73 and $0.39 for cotton sheeting; $0.90&#13;
and $0.68 for cotton duck; and $0.80 and $0.34 for cotton print cloth. Average&#13;
unit values for the three categories, taken together, were $0.53 for domes-&#13;
tic production, $0.80 for exports, and $0.38 for imports.-/&#13;

to A-32. All figures are per square yard; unit values for U.S. produc-&#13;
tion of the individual fabric types are not available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
In explaining these differences, use may be made of information&#13;
provided in a recent report of the U.S. International Trade Commission on&#13;
cotton textiles imported from Pakistan that account for one-third of&#13;
U.S. imports of cotton sheeting, cotton duck, and cotton print cloth. Accord-&#13;
ing to the report, "the types of cotton fabric which are produced in the&#13;
largest quantity by the Pakistani textile industry include heavy coarse&#13;
fabrics, which consume large quantities of raw cotton and can be manufactur-&#13;
ed by less sophisticated machinery with relatively lower skilled labor.""lI&#13;
Thus, while "imports of sheeting from Pakistan are heavily concentrated in&#13;
the coarse osnaburg and classes A and B sheeting ... the finer class C&#13;
sheeting accounted for more than two-thirds of domestic production." 2/ Also,&#13;
imports of single-warp ducks from Pakistan "were concentrated in the lighter&#13;
weight single fillings of average yarn numbers 10 to 15 /whereas7 the domes-&#13;
tic production of ply-warp ducks /a more sophisticated product7 had very&#13;
little competition from Pakistani imports."3/ Finally, imports of print cloth&#13;
from Pakistan were concentrated in types of fabric having average yarn numbers&#13;
20 through 39 as compared to usual range of between 27 and 44.-/&#13;
Men's and boys' cotton T-shirts provide another example of differences&#13;
in product composition in U.S. production, exports, and imports. In 1979, unit&#13;
values per dozen were $14.35 in domestic production, $20.70 in exports, and&#13;
$9.45 in imports.5/  These differences reflect the fact that men's and boys'&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

T-shirts have increasingly become fashion items, with U.S. producers offering&#13;
brand names that have particular consumer appeal.&#13;
The described cases provide evidence of an upgrading process in the&#13;
U.S. textiles and clothing industry, with imports taking the place of domestic&#13;
production that has shifted to higher value-added items which are more profit-&#13;
able and use more skilled labor. Value added per unit is even higher for&#13;
exports, indicating the comparative advantages of the United States in&#13;
relatively sophisticated products.&#13;
Product specialization, then, provides advantages to the U.S.&#13;
textile and clothing industry and to the national economy in general, which&#13;
are not reflected by the industry averages. In this connection, it should&#13;
be added that the process of upgrading in the U.S. textile industry continues,&#13;
with the shift from woven to knitted fabrics and, most recently, to stretch&#13;
fabrics.&#13;
Vertical Specialization&#13;
Given its prominence in discussions on the effects of imports from&#13;
developing countries, the textiles and clothing industry has been chosen as&#13;
a case study in this paper. But, welfare gains may be obtained through&#13;
horizontal, or product specialization in other industries as well.-/ Further&#13;
gains can be derived from vertical specialization through the international&#13;
division of the production process.&#13;
A well-known example of vertical specialization is importation&#13;
into the United States under tariff items 807.00 and 806.30, when duties apply&#13;
1/ This is the case, for example, in the shoe industrywhere an upgrading of&#13;
domestic production occurred pari passu with increased imports from the&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
only to value added abroad but not to the U.S. inputs used in foreign production.&#13;
The total value of such imports rose from $1.0 billion in 1966 to $2.2 billion&#13;
in 1970, $7.2 billion in 1977, $9.7 billion in 1978, and $11.9 billion in&#13;
1979. In recent years, on the average, 72-73 percent of the total represent-&#13;
ed value added abroad.l/&#13;
About 45 percent of all imports entering under tariff items 807.00&#13;
and 806.30 originate in developing countries, with imports from Mexico&#13;
($2.1 billion), Malaysia ($0.7 billion) and Singapore ($0.6 billion) being&#13;
the most Important. But, value added abroad amounts to only 51 percent of&#13;
the value of such imports originating in the developing countries.-/&#13;
In the trade literature.much attention has been given to imports&#13;
under tariff items 807.00 and 806.30 into the United States and to imports&#13;
under similar provisions into European countries.-/ These forms of offshore&#13;
procurement, however, represent only part of the trade that occurs in the&#13;
framework of the international division of the production process. Thus,&#13;
while U.S. imports from developing countries under tariff items 807.00 and&#13;
806.30 are dominated by television apparatus and semiconductors, there are&#13;
rising imports of parts, components and accessories of machinery and transport&#13;
equipment from the developing countries.&#13;
Parts, components, and accessories figure prominently in U.S.&#13;
imports originating in Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan,each of which ships&#13;

several times more manufactured goods to the United States than Mexico and&#13;
Malaysia that surpass them in terms of U.S. imports under tariff items&#13;
807.00 and 806.30. There is further a reverse flow of parts, components and&#13;
accessories from the developed countries for assembly in the developing&#13;
countries. For example, Taiwanese firms buy technologically sophisticated as&#13;
well as capital-intensive parts, components, and accessories from the United&#13;
States and Japan for assembly in Taiwan. This is the converse of the pattern&#13;
observed in the developed countries that purchase simple, labor intensive&#13;
parts, components, and accessories from the developing countries.&#13;
Note finally that the end products of the international division&#13;
of the production process may also be sold in third countries. A case in&#13;
point is worldwide sourcing in the automobile industry by General Motors and&#13;
Ford that have established plants producing particular parts, components, and&#13;
accessories in some two dozen countries. At the same time, practically no&#13;
automobiles and automobile parts are imported into the United States from&#13;
developing countries under tariff items 807.00 and 806.30.&#13;
The Changing Scope of Intra-industry Trade -/&#13;
The preceding considerations point to the increasing importance of&#13;
intra-industry specialization in manufactured trade between developed and develop-&#13;
ing countries, This proposition is suPported bv the results of emDrical studies&#13;
by Finger and Kreinen, Wolter, and the present author. The studies show that&#13;
the extent of intra-industry specialization increased over time in trade&#13;
with the newly-industrializing or semi-industrial develoning countries&#13;
1/ In the following, the expression "intra-industry trade" and "intra-industry&#13;
specialization will be used interchangeably.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
as well as with countries at lower levels of development.&#13;
Using an index of export similarity, Finger and Kreinen have&#13;
concluded that "the /manufactured/ export pattern of the Semi-Industrial&#13;
LDC has become markedly more similar to the export patterns of the Old EEC&#13;
/i.e. the Common Market of the Six/ and the United States, and slightly&#13;
more similar to the export pattern of Japan."-/ Changes in the same direction&#13;
have been observed in countries at lower levels of development, although&#13;
the export structure of these countries has remained more dissimilar to that&#13;
of the developed countries.&#13;
The increased similarity of the export structure of developed and&#13;
developing countries is indicative of the growing importance of intra-industry&#13;
specialization between developed and developing countries. This conclusion is&#13;
confirmed by Wolter who examined changes over time in the extent of intra-&#13;
industry sPecialization in Germany's trade in manufactured goods with various&#13;
groups of countries.&#13;
Wolter has found that, between 1969 and 1977, the extent of intra-&#13;
industry specialization increased substantially in Germany's trade with the&#13;
newly-industrializing developing countries and with other developing countries&#13;
while it increased much less in trade with the developed countries and declined&#13;
in trade with the centrally planned economies. Nevertheless, the extent of&#13;
intra-industry specialization continued to be the highest in trade with&#13;
the developed countries, followed by the newly-industrializing developing&#13;

countries, the centrally planned economies, and the other developing countries.-&#13;
Wolter's calculations have been made using the three-digit breakdown&#13;
of the U.N. Standard International Trade Classification (SITC). The present&#13;
author has employed a 91 industry classification scheme, consisting of&#13;
3 and 4 digit SITC items and their combinations, that defines an industry to&#13;
include commodities with high substitution elasticities in production.-/&#13;
The author has made estimates for the United States, Germany, the United&#13;
Kingdom, and Japan for the years 1969 and 1979.-/ For each of these countries,&#13;
Table 2 shows the extent of intra-industry specialization or, a scale from 0 to&#13;
1 in trade with developed countries (DC), centrally planned economies (CPE),&#13;
newly-industrializing developing countries (NIC), oil-importing less developed&#13;
countries (LDC), and oil-exporting developing countries (OPEC),&#13;
In 1979, the extent of intra-industry specialization in manufactured&#13;
trade with developed countries was the hitghest in the United Kingdom and Germany;&#13;
they were followed by the United States, with Japan far behind. The greater&#13;
degree of intra-industry specialization in the first two countries is&#13;
explained by their participation in the European Common Market where the&#13;

extent of intra-industry specialization is greater with the countries of&#13;
North America and Western Europe than with Japan and it is greater in&#13;
trade with the oil-importing than with the oil-exporting developing&#13;
countries.&#13;

elimination of tariffs has been conducive to such trade.!/ Also, its entry&#13;
in the European Common Market in the early seventies explains that between&#13;
1969 and 1979 the extent of intra-industry specialization increased the most&#13;
in the United Kingdom,where the ratio of the 1979 to 1969 results were 1.43 as&#13;
compared to 1.12 in the United States, 1.10 in Germany,and 1.04 in Japan.&#13;
In turn, its long history of protectionism contributed to the low&#13;
level of intra-industry specialization in trade with developed countries, and&#13;
the small increase shown between 1969 and 1979, in Japan. This conclusion also&#13;
applies to trade with developing countries, where Japan exhibits a substantially&#13;
lower degree of intra-industry specialization than the other three countries.&#13;
At the same time, in all four countries, the 1969-1979 period saw a&#13;
rapid increase in the extent of intra-industry specialization in trade with both&#13;
the newly-industrializing developing countries-/ and the group of oil-importing&#13;
less developed countries. The raticsof the 1979 to 1969 results in trade with&#13;
the two groups of countries, respectively, were 1.19 and 1.82 in the United States,&#13;
1.81 and 2.45 in Germany, 1.40 and 2.48 in the United Kingdom, and 1.80 and 1.93&#13;
in Japan.&#13;
The extent of intra-industry specialization in trade with developing&#13;
countries was already high in 1969 in the United Kingdom and the United States,&#13;
1/  Bela Balassa, "Tariff Reductions and Trade in Manufactures Among Industrial&#13;
Countries," op. cit.&#13;
2/  Newly-industrializing countries have been defined as countries that had per&#13;
capita incomes between $1400 and $3500 in 1977 and where the share of&#13;
manufacturing in the gross domestic product was 20 percent or higher in&#13;
1977. The group include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Uruguay,&#13;
Greece, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Israel, Hong Kong, Korea,&#13;
Singapore, and Taiwan (Following the usual practice, Israel with per capita&#13;
incomes of $4120 has been included in the group that excludes Ireland with&#13;
per capita incomes of $3476). The data originate in the 1977 WorZd Bank&#13;
AtZas,CWashington, D.C., 1980) and the WorZd DeveZopment Report, 1979&#13;

reflecting the effects of relati7vely liberal policies towards the manufactured&#13;
exports of the developing countries and, in the case of the United Kingdom,&#13;
Commonealth preference. In turn, the extent of intra-industry specialization&#13;
in trade with the two groups of developing countries remained at a level much&#13;
below that of the other three countries in Japan where protection was the&#13;
strongest.&#13;
Excepting the United Kingdom, the extent of intra-industry special-&#13;
ization was considerably higher in trade with the newly-industrializing developing&#13;
countries than with the oil-importing less developed countries, indicating the&#13;
increased importance of intra-industry specialization in countries at higher&#13;
levels of development. In the case of the U.K., the results are explained&#13;
by the effects of Commonealth preference that benefited several large less&#13;
developed countries but did not affect the newly-industrializing developing&#13;
countries other than Hong Kong.&#13;
At the same time, apart from the United States, the extent of intra-indust&#13;
specialization in trade with the centrally planned economies declined between&#13;
1968 and 1979 to a level much below that in trade with the newly-industrial-&#13;
izing developing countries. Finally, trade with the OPEC countries is characterized&#13;
by inter-industry specialization.&#13;
Conclusions and Policy Implications&#13;
The increasing importance of intra-industry trade between developed&#13;
and developing countries points to the conclusion that the adverse effects&#13;
of imports from the developing countries on particular industries of the&#13;
developed countries have been much exaggerated. As Wolter notes, "With the&#13;
increase in intraindustry trade, adjustment can often take the form of&#13;
reorganizing production within existing firms by changing the product mix,&#13;
product differentiation, upgrading, and so forth, at their original location"ly/&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Thus, horizontal specialization entails a shift to higher value-added products&#13;
in the developed countries as simple lower value-added products are imported&#13;
from the developing countries. In turn, vertical specialization involves&#13;
the exchange of parts, components and accessories requiring skilled and&#13;
technical labor, more sophisticated technology, and physical capital.&#13;
The importation of inputs that use largely unskilled labor also&#13;
lowers the cost of production in the developed countries, thereby increasing&#13;
export possibilities and/or leading to more effective import competition. This&#13;
is the case, for example, in the textiles industry where grey fabrics imported&#13;
from developing countries are transformed into higher value products.&#13;
At the same time, intra-industry trade involves little adjustment&#13;
cost in the developed countries. This is the situation, in particular, in&#13;
the case of horizontal specialization, since firms can change their product&#13;
composition and workers can be redirected within the firm. In fact, the rise&#13;
of imports may benefit the firm and its workers through shifting to more&#13;
profitable lines of production and the upgrading of the labor force. And, reducing&#13;
product variety may provide further gains through the use of specialized&#13;
machinery and learning by doing.&#13;
Adjustment costs associated with vertical specialization, too, will&#13;
be relatively low. In cases when the same firm produces several parts or&#13;
components,the shift can be accomplished within the firm. And even if this&#13;
was not the case, the skills used in the production of particular parts,&#13;
components, and accessories are likely to be transferable to the production&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
of others.&#13;
Exploiting comparative advantage through inter-industry special-&#13;
ization, however, involves adjustment costs. At the same time, these costs&#13;
decline with the length of the period of adjustment. In this connection, the&#13;
experience of New England in the United States is of particular interest.&#13;
New England provides an example of successful adjustment. With&#13;
the relocation of the textiles and shoe industries to the South of the United&#13;
States, New England has shifted to the production of high technology products,&#13;
such as computers, electronic equipment and instruments. Following the&#13;
near-exhaustion of the labor supply, these industries have recently expanded&#13;
from the state of Massachusetts northwards where they utilize the skills of&#13;
workers in declining industries. It has been reported, for example, that&#13;
"because they had done stitching in the old shoe factory ... Littletown&#13;
/New Hampshire/ workers were adept at learning the wiring, assembling and&#13;
other hand work required for an electronic subcontractor."-L/ Also, in Berlin,&#13;
New Hampshire, "A Converse sneaker factory closed in 1979, primarily because&#13;
of the area's strength in computer and electronics."-/&#13;
The case of the shoe workers conflicts with the claim as to the&#13;
practical impossibility of moving workers from one industry to another.-&#13;

3/ The author recalls a statement made at a World Bank Seminar on Industrial-&#13;
ization and Trade Policies in the 1970s, held in October 1972, by Nat&#13;
Goldfinger a senior advisor to the AFL-CIO on trade matters, according&#13;
to whom the period of adjustment in the shoe industry was 50 years!&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The transferability of skills is also indicated by a study of 120 occupational&#13;
categories in 58 industries that cover all the major developed countries.-/   And&#13;
in cases when skills are not directly transferable, retraining programs may&#13;
be employed and the normal attrition of the labor force may be reinforced by&#13;
the application of early retirement provisions.-/&#13;
Early retirement provisions, together with normal attrition and&#13;
retraining, will determine the speed at which decreases in the production of&#13;
a particular industry may be acceptable to the developed countries. At the&#13;
same time, it should be emphasized that, apart from the push emanating from&#13;
technological change and imports, there is a pull from other industries as&#13;
indicated by the example of the sneaker factory. 'Pull' and 'push' factors&#13;
also operate within individual industries as imports in part take the place&#13;
of the abandoned home production of low-value added products of low domestic&#13;
profitability and in part prompt the upgrading of home production for domestic&#13;
use as well as for exports.&#13;
These considerations indicate the benefits developed countries&#13;
would derive from increasing the exchange of manufactured goods with the&#13;
developing countries at rates exceeding the projections made for the period&#13;
1978-90. Increased imports would be desirable, in particular, in textiles&#13;
and clothing, where the Multifiber Arrangement may serve as a vehicle for&#13;
this purpose. The aim should be to reach the maximum growth of imports that is&#13;

compatible with an acceptable speed of adjustment in the developed countries.&#13;
In this way, one could transform the Multifiber Arrangement from&#13;
an instrument of protection to one of adjustment. The opportunity for such a&#13;
transformation is provided by the 1981 renegotiation of the Arrangement. Apart&#13;
from allowing for a satisfactory overall growth of imports from traditional&#13;
sources, it would be necessary to ensure markets for newly-emerging exporters&#13;
and to modify the provisions of the 1977 Arrangement that increased the&#13;
discretion of developed countries for unilateral action and reduced the&#13;
flexibility of the developing countries to shift products among individual&#13;
categories .l/&#13;
Rather than ex ante quantitative limitations as under the Multi-&#13;
fiber Arrangement, ex post safeguards should be utilized in the event that a&#13;
sudden surge of imports causes serious injury in other industries of the&#13;
developed countries. This, in turn, would require rectifying the failure&#13;
of the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations to reach agreement on&#13;
an international safeguard code. The newly-established code should provide&#13;
for the surveillance of national practices as well as for the resolution of&#13;
conflicts in cases when safeguard measures have been employed.&#13;
One may envisage a two-stage procedure, under which national&#13;
authorities could impose safeguard measures unilaterally, subject to certain&#13;
conditions.-/ These conditions would include the provision that the share&#13;

of imports from the developing countries in the domestic consumption is not&#13;
reduced, that the safeguards are not invoked against the least developing&#13;
countries, and that the application of the safeguard measures remains&#13;
temorary. The temporary nature of the safeguard measures would 'be expressed&#13;
by their limited duration, the progressive liberalization of import restrictions&#13;
during the period of their application, and the requirement that the re-imposition&#13;
of safeguards be countenanced by an international forum.&#13;
The application of these provisions would allow for speedy action on&#13;
the part of the developed countries without the need for agreement on the&#13;
international level. Developing countries could, however, bring complaints&#13;
under the safeguard code to an international forum if the provisions are not&#13;
respected, and this forum would countenance an extension of the period of&#13;
application of safeguards only if appropriate adjustment measures have been&#13;
taken. The provision of the code should ,also apply to the safeguard measures&#13;
presently employed that would be subject to review under the code.&#13;

Appendix&#13;
The author originally estimated the extent of intra-industry specializa-&#13;
tion as an unweighted average of "representative ratios," defined as the ratio&#13;
of the absolute difference between exports and imports to the sum of the exports&#13;
and imports in each industry.l/   The formula is shown in equation (1).&#13;
(1)     1  lxi-&#13;
n-  (X  + Mi)&#13;
Grubel and Lloyd subsequently calculated trade-weighted rather than&#13;
unweighted averages of these ratios and attempted to adjust for the extent&#13;
of trade imbalance.-/   In turn, Aquino showed that the Grubel-Lloyd adjustment&#13;
for trade imbalance does not provide consistent results and proposed an&#13;
alternative for consistent measurement.3/   The present author made use of&#13;
Aquino's formulation but made adjustment for the imbalance in total trade&#13;
rather than in trade in manufactured goods as Aquino had done, so as to take&#13;
account of inter-industry specialization between primary and manufactured&#13;
goods.-4 The same procedure has been applied in the present paper except&#13;
that, following Grubel-Lloyd and Aquino, the results obtained have&#13;
been deducted from 1. This formulation has the advantage that changes&#13;
over time in the extent of intra-industry trade are more directly observable&#13;
from the results.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            It is shown in the paper that trade in
            manufactured goods with the developing countries benefitted
            the developed countries by increasing demand for their
            products at a time of low capacity utilization as well as
            through specialization according to comparative advantage.
            The developed countries will derive further gains from the
            future expansion of this trade, estimated by the author for
            the 1978-90 period on the assumption of the continuation of
            present trade policies. At the same time, under the
            assumptions made, the rapid growth of manufactured exports
            of the developing countries would continue. It has also been
            alleged that obtaining long-term gains through international
            specialization in manufactures entails a considerable cost
            of adjustment in the developed countries. The paper provides
            evidence that these fears have been much exaggerated. For
            one thing, manufactured trade between developed and
            developing countries increasingly involves intra-industry
            specialization that has a low adjustment cost. For another
            thing, the transferability of skills in various occupational
            categories limit the cost of adjustment in inter-industry
            specialization and this cost can be further reduced through
            retraining and early retirement provisions.
