&#13;
 · Benchmarking performance should enable comparison.&#13;

   encouragement for the better performers to maintain and&#13;
   improve their position.&#13;
 · Benchmarking should enable policy makers and nodal&#13;
   agencies to monitor performance on a rational basis and&#13;
   thereby channel resources and efforts on the basis of                                              5.&#13;

            Benchmarking local government performance
            on rural sanitation : learning from Himachal Pradesh, India
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Open defecation is a traditional
            behavior in rural India. Conventional rural sanitation
            programs have been based on the assumption that people
            defecate in the open because they are too poor to afford the
            cost of constructing a toilet. Therefore, subsidies for
            upfront capital costs were provided to generate demand for
            'sanitation,' interpreted narrowly as a pour-flush
            toilet. These programs increased the reported coverage of
            household toilets but had a poor record with respect to
            toilet usage, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability. To
            address the shortcomings of conventional rural sanitation
            programs, the Government of India launched the Total
            Sanitation Campaign (TSC) in 1999, with the goal of
            achieving universal rural sanitation coverage by 2012. The
            Water and Sanitation Program's (WSP) Global Scaling up
            Sanitation Project (also known as Total Sanitation and
            Sanitation Marketing, or TSSM) leverages the TSC framework
            and resources. TSSM combines Community-Led Total Sanitation
            (CLTS) with sanitation marketing to help local governments
            effectively use their funds to end open defecation and
            achieve sustainable impact.
