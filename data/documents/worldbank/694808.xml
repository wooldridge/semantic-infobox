SECOND ROADS PROJECTS&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:              Romania&#13;
Beneficiaries and      National Administration of Roads (NAR); Romania Automobile Registry&#13;
Implementing Agencies: (RAR); Ministry of Transport Secretariat to the Interministerial Committee&#13;
for Traffic Safety (MOT/SICRS); Ministry of Education; Traffic Police&#13;
Department.&#13;
Amount:                US$150 million.&#13;
Terms:                 20 years including 5 years grace at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-&#13;
based US dollar single currency loans.&#13;
Commitment Fee:       0.75% of the undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after signing,&#13;
less any waiver.&#13;
Onlending Terms:       Same as Bank terms.&#13;
Project Objectives:    a)   improve traffic safety and the fitness of the vehicle fleet;&#13;
b)    continue helping Romania to meet the changing pattern of demand&#13;
for land transport infrastructure;&#13;
c)   improve the management and performance of NAR;&#13;
d)    assist the Romanian civil works construction industry in its transition&#13;
to a market economy; and&#13;
e)    promote the reduction of lead in petrol.&#13;
Project Description:    The project will consist of 5 components:&#13;
a)    a program of about 1,000 km of road and bridge rehabilitation to&#13;
include overlaying or reconstruction on the existing alignment, some&#13;
widening, construction of hard shoulders and minor geometric&#13;
improvements;&#13;
b)    a traffic safety program (TSP) involving components in education,&#13;
engineering, (roads and vehicles) and enforcement;&#13;
c)    a program of institution building involving computerization of NAR&#13;
and the introduction of bridge and pavement management systems;&#13;
transport planning; continuation of work towards contracting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
out/privatizing of periodic maintenance and installation of permanent&#13;
traffic counting and axle load controls;&#13;
d)    a program of assistance to the road and bridge construction industry,&#13;
including establishment of a secretariat; training programs and&#13;
financing of equipment; and&#13;
e)    preparation of an Action Plan for the reduction of lead in petrol.&#13;
Project Benefits and&#13;
Risks:                 The project supports the rehabilitation of infrastructure, harmonization of&#13;
standards with the EU and environmental improvements which have been&#13;
identified as priority concerns in the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS). The project also will raise the efficiency of public sector&#13;
management, reduce the state role in the economy by contracting out&#13;
construction and maintenance activities previously handled by force&#13;
account. The project benefits are in terms of reduced transport cost and&#13;
reduced accident costs which are expected to be widely dispersed&#13;
throughout the economy. The weighted average ERRs for road&#13;
rehabilitation is 48%. For the road safety component ERRs range from&#13;
40% to over 90%.&#13;
There are few risks which would affect the economic rates of return of the&#13;
project. For the road rehabilitation component, the main one would be that&#13;
traffic growth would be less than expected and benefits would thus be&#13;
lower than estimated. For the road safety component, the risk is that the&#13;
reduction of accidents will be less than expected, but the savings of even&#13;
minor reduction in accidents are so large in comparison to the level of&#13;
investment that the ERR will remain high.&#13;
The more significant risks are of a broader institutional nature:&#13;
a)   insufficient counterpart funds. The risk has been reduced with the&#13;
recent approval of the Road Fund Law which will provide NAR&#13;
with funds to complement the budget allocation. In addition the&#13;
Government has undertaken that the project will be given priority&#13;
over any other investments to be undertaken by NAR, however a&#13;
residual risk does remain given Romania's history of fiscal&#13;
difficulties, and in anticipation of potential problems, annual&#13;
consultations on budget allocations and a mid-term review are&#13;
provided under the project;&#13;
b)    strained implementation capacity in the earlier stages of the project,&#13;
while the Transport Project is still under implementation. To reduce&#13;
this risk, technical assistance to the PMU is provided in the project;&#13;
c)    delays in implementing the agreed strategy on commercialization of&#13;
periodic maintenance operations. NAR has already started the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
process in 3 of its 7 regions and there is specific assistance in the&#13;
project to deepen and extend the process; and&#13;
d)   implementation of the traffic safety component is dispersed among&#13;
many different agencies not used to working together and&#13;
coordination may be difficult. The project envisages drawing&#13;
technical assistance from an established European traffic safety&#13;
organization with links to its own analogous agencies.&#13;

I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. The Transport System&#13;
1.1       Romania is one of the largest of the former centrally planned economies in the Central&#13;
and East European (CEE) Region with a land area of 237,000 square km and a population of 23&#13;
million, second only to Poland. Per capita income in 1995 was estimated at about US$1,450. The&#13;
country has a wide range of natural resources, including a fertile agricultural base, deposits of coal,&#13;
lignite, oil, natural gas and other minerals. Long a major food producer, Romania was a large&#13;
exporter of agricultural products until the early eighties.&#13;
1.2       The transport system has relied primarily on the railways, which have a well developed&#13;
network of 11,000 km, of which 36% is electrified and 26% is double track. The road network&#13;
totals 73,000 km, of which 20% are national roads carrying 60% of the traffic. Road density, with&#13;
regard to both population and land area, is the lowest among all CEE countries. The Danube offers a&#13;
navigable distance of 1,075 km in Romania and the Danube-Black Sea Canal (68 km) was opened to&#13;
traffic in 1984. Ninety percent of foreign trade is handled through the port of Constanza on the Black&#13;
sea. There are five major river ports on the Danube, the largest of which is Galati, accessible to&#13;
ocean-going vessels up to 15,000 tons. There are 17 airports of which 4 are international. The&#13;
transport sector contributes 4.8% of the GDP and accounts for 5% of the country's employment.&#13;
B. Traffic&#13;
1.3       Traffic on all modes has been adversely affected by the large downturn in the economy,&#13;
compounded by the restructuring of the economy away from heavy industry which was traditionally a&#13;
large user of transport. Since 1990, GDP declined by nearly 30%, industrial output declined by&#13;
nearly 52%, exports fell by nearly 55%, real wages declined by about 30%, investment by nearly&#13;
60%, and unemployment reached 10% of the labor force by end-1995 from near zero in 1989. The&#13;
share of industry in GDP declined to 40% from 54% in 1989, and that of agriculture has risen to&#13;
about 24% from 14% in the 1980s, while trading activities have almost doubled since 1989. Modest&#13;
growth was recorded in 1994 and in 1995.&#13;
1.4       As in other centrally planned economies, Romania's transport sector has been heavily rail&#13;
oriented. In 1960, rail accounted for over 80% of freight traffic and over 70% of passenger traffic&#13;
(Tables 1.1 and 1.2). While the rail share has gone down since then, in 1989 rail still accounted for&#13;
almost 70% of freight and over 40% of passenger traffic. The high share of rail freight was the&#13;
result of regulation forcing all transport above 50 km to the railways; this regulation has now been&#13;
abolished. Rail freight reached 300 million tons and 80 billion ton-km in the late 80s, but has fallen&#13;
dramatically since then. In 1995, it was down to less one third of its 1989 level at 27 billion ton-km.&#13;
Passenger traffic held up better, going down to 45% of its earlier level.&#13;
1.5       Road traffic grew rapidly in the 70s but stagnated in the 80s as it was suppressed by&#13;
physical control and regulation. Car traffic increased dramatically in 1990, but fell back thereafter as&#13;
fuel prices were adjusted to reflect world market prices. Truck traffic has been less buoyant due to&#13;
the downturn in the economy, but has been affected less than rail traffic. There is virtually no&#13;
intercity bus service at this time and railways remain the essential long distance passenger carrier.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
Non-motorized transport (NMT) is almost totally absent in cities, but both the bicycles and horse&#13;
drawn vehicles are significant in, and adjacent to the linear villages. Both classes of NMT will be&#13;
considered in a traffic safety pilot study under the project (Annex 3).&#13;
1.6       Traffic through Constanta port was around 60 million tons p.a. in the late 80s, but is also&#13;
down by one third since then. Of the earlier traffic, about 60% was liquid bulk and another 30% dry&#13;
bulk, leaving only about 5 million tons of general cargo. Container traffic was small but has&#13;
increased rapidly since 1989 as Romania's markets are diversifying. Inland water traffic is&#13;
insignificant at less than 4% of total land traffic. On the Danube-Black Sea Canal, traffic reached&#13;
12.5 million tons in 1989, well below the forecasts of 75 million tons made in 1979 before&#13;
construction. Traffic in 1990 had fallen to some 6 million tons but has begun to grow again with the&#13;
lifting of the embargo on Serbia. Maritime traffic carried by the Romanian fleet quadrupled in the&#13;
70s from 4 to 16 million tons p.a. and more than doubled again to 36 million tons in 1989. It has&#13;
since fallen to less than 4 million tons.&#13;
C.  Investments&#13;
1.7      Investments in the transport sector have been around 10% of total public investments,&#13;
substantially below the level in market economies. Until the late 70s, railways received the bulk of&#13;
the investments in the sector. Later, the balance shifted toward water transport (maritime, river and&#13;
canals) with the construction of the new Constanza port, the Danube-Black Sea Canal and the&#13;
Bucharest-Danube Canal (now abandoned) and a major increase in the maritime fleet. In the 80s,&#13;
total water transport investments absorbed well over 50% of total transport investments, while rail&#13;
received about 27%. By comparison, investments in road infrastructure decreased from 9% in the&#13;
late 70s to less than 5% in the 80s (Table 1.3). In the 80s, construction started on the Bucharest&#13;
metro and, between 1986 and 1990, this absorbed about twice the amounts invested in the entire road&#13;
infrastructure of Romania. In recent years, investments in the sector have come to a virtual halt as a&#13;
result of the Government's efforts to reduce its budget deficit. For instance, in 1992, investment for&#13;
the whole sector was US$35 million, only allowing for urgent capital repairs and periodic&#13;
maintenance and no new investments. Transport sector capital investments increased to around&#13;
US$75 million in both 1993 and 1994 and to US$130 million in 1995 as a result of the European&#13;
Investment Bank (EIB)/European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) Transport&#13;
Project. The 1996 budget was around US$110 million, still a very low level at 0.3% of GDP.&#13;
D. Institutions&#13;
1.8      In 1990 and 1991, major changes took place in the transport institutions. The former&#13;
Ministry of Transport and Public Works was split into two separate Ministries. The Ministry of&#13;
Transport (MOT) was reorganized to concentrate on policy making and regulation functions rather&#13;
then being an operator of transport means. The railways, highways and ports became autonomous&#13;
units or "Regie Autonome" (RA), while road transport departments, construction departments and&#13;
design or research institutes became respectively transport companies, contractor and consultant&#13;
commercial companies (CC). The shares of most of these CC are still owned by the state, but&#13;
privatization has started and some CCs are now partially owned by the private sector. The MOT was&#13;
reorganized again in September 1994 to place even greater emphasis on its policy making and&#13;
regulatory function, while further limiting its interference in the running of transport operations, and&#13;
its staff was reduced from 450 to 350.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
E. Sectoral Issues&#13;
1.9       One of the main difficulties when assessing the justification of new investments in the&#13;
sector is to evaluate the future volume and pattern of transport demand. The shift to a market&#13;
economy is resulting in less emphasis on transport intensive industries such as steel, cement and&#13;
petrochemicals and more on higher value added light industry such as textiles and agro-industry. The&#13;
latter will require lower transport volumes and are more likely to use road transport than rail or water&#13;
transport. Romania's use of energy was also very intensive. The demand for lignite and coal&#13;
transport may decline as the electric power company, RENEL, switches to nuclear (the first unit of&#13;
the Cernavoda power plant is in commercial operation) and from domestic lignite, which is currently&#13;
transported by the railway, to imported coal. As energy subsidies are phased out, and industries&#13;
conserve fuel to reduce operating costs, further reductions in coal transport can be expected.&#13;
Railways are unlikely to recoup much of the lost traffic and will have to concentrate on developing&#13;
new markets such as international freight and combined transport. On the passenger side, the need to&#13;
increase tariffs in order to reduce subsidies could moderate travel demand somewhat. As regards&#13;
road use by cars, it is expected that the growth in motorization will continue.&#13;
1.10      Investments in the transport sector were skewed toward very large projects without regard&#13;
for economic and financial feasibility. The result is that funds for maintenance, rehabilitation,&#13;
replacement of life-expired equipment and modernization were scarce. Existing infrastructure and&#13;
equipment are obsolete and service availability is low. The Bank together with EBRD is introducing&#13;
the use of economic feasibility studies as a basis for improving decision making on investments.&#13;
1.11      The sector was no exception to the general distortions resulting from administrative rather&#13;
than market drices. Fuel prices are still controlled, but Government policy is to ensure that they&#13;
reflect fluctuations in world markets. Under the 1992 Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) agreement&#13;
was reached that Government would adjust them periodically to reflect external prices and exchange&#13;
rate movements. Road transport prices are free for freight, but still regulated for public passenger&#13;
transport. Similarly, railways have some flexibility in setting freight tariffs, but full control remains&#13;
on passenger tariffs. However, under the recently approved Railway Rehabilitation project&#13;
agreement has been reached on financial targets that will drive the tariff setting process. During 1996&#13;
railway tariffs were cumulatively increased by 74% (freight) and 99% (passengers) over the&#13;
December 1995 level. Further significant increases were made in February and in May 1997.&#13;
F. Sector Strategy&#13;
1.12      The following principles and policies are guiding the action of Government in the&#13;
transport sector:&#13;
(a)    Equality of treatment between private transport enterprises and state owned means&#13;
of transport;&#13;
(b)    Financial autonomy of transport companies;&#13;
(c)    Freedom of action by transport companies, in terms of entry, routes, cargoes,&#13;
tariffs and investments;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(d)    Free modal choice by transport users; and&#13;
(e)   Investment decisions based on economic analysis.&#13;
Regarding investments in the sector, the strategy of the Ministry of Transport is as follows:&#13;
(a)    Short term: to arrest the technical and operational deterioration of the system;&#13;
(b)    Medium term: to renovate the existing transport capacity taking into account the&#13;
patterns of changing demand resulting from free competition between modes; and&#13;
(c)    Longer term: to modernize and develop the infrastructure, equipment and vehicles&#13;
to match the economic and technical levels of Western Europe.&#13;
This strategy is sound and is reflected in this project on the investment side as well as by the&#13;
agreements reached regarding reforms to be introduced in the sector.&#13;
G. Previous Bank Experience in the Sector&#13;
1.13          The Bank has financed four projects in the transport sector; two under the previous&#13;
political regime and two since 1989. The first two were the Danube-Black Sea Canal Project (Loan&#13;
1794-RO); US$100 million, January 1980; and the Land Transport Project (Loan 2034-RO); US$125&#13;
million, April 1981. More recently we processed the Transport Project (Loan 3593-RO), US$120&#13;
million; April 1993; and the Railway Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3976-RO); January 1996 both of&#13;
which are under implementation. In January 1987, OED issued the PPAR for the first project. The&#13;
main conclusion was that, although completion was 17 months behind schedule, the work was&#13;
generally good. However traffic did not materialize to the extent expected and therefore the financial&#13;
results and economic benefits were lower than estimated. A main issue raised in the report concerns&#13;
the role of the Bank. The Bank loan came five years after construction of the canal had started and&#13;
mainly supplied finance (about 5% of total cost). It would have been better to participate earlier in&#13;
the project cycle to have an impact on technical and economic decisions before they were made.&#13;
1.14       The second project was completed and the loan closed on schedule in May 1987. The&#13;
Project Completion Report (PCR) was issued in January 1992. The overall assessment was&#13;
satisfactory. Disbursements were faster than expected and the project cost was well below estimates.&#13;
Economic returns were lower than expected following the downturn in the economy since 1990, but&#13;
all components remain justified. Issues of past irregular procurement practices were highlighted by&#13;
the Government in its commentary on the project.&#13;
1.15       The ongoing Transport Project (Loan 3593-RO), co-financed with EBRD, EIB, and the&#13;
European Union Assistance Program for Eastern Europe (EU-PHARE) was prepared rapidly and the&#13;
cooperation throughout the project's preparation was outstanding, with the Bank's comments on&#13;
project design, concept and implementation fully taken into account. Progress on project execution&#13;
has been very good and disbursements which have reached 90% of the loan amount are ahead of&#13;
schedule. The Railway Rehabilitation Project, cofinanced with EBRD and EU-PHARE, only became&#13;
effective in August 1996, so it is still too early to assess its progress, but the quality of cooperation is&#13;
very satisfactory.&#13;

1.16        Findings of OED on recently completed highway projects indicate that project success is&#13;
enhanced when:&#13;
-       operating agencies have authority delegated by line ministries to manage well&#13;
defined projects and adequate budget resources to carry them out;&#13;
-       individual project components are of high priority, straight forward and under&#13;
clear-cut responsibility of only one agency;&#13;
-       agencies demonstrate ownership of projects;&#13;
-       projects are closely supervised and there is a mid-term review; and&#13;
-       detailed terms of reference are available early on for the preparation of&#13;
complex action plans, especially when many agencies are involved (road&#13;
safety).&#13;
In addition, OED found that efficiency is improved by devolving supply of services to the private&#13;
sector, but privatization of state owned enterprises is politically difficult and can only be achieved&#13;
when there is strong commitment.&#13;
1.17        These lessons have been taken into account in the design and preparation of this project.&#13;
The road administration - a regie autonome (see paragraph 2.6) - has full authority to manage the&#13;
project and the introduction of the road fund (para. 2.13) will strengthen its financial situation. The&#13;
selection of about 1,000 km out of 3,000 km analyzed in detail reflect the high priority of the roads&#13;
to be rehabilitated under the project. The short list of roads to be improved was discussed thoroughly&#13;
within the administration and with the line ministry and there is a high ownership of the project. We&#13;
intend to supervise the project closely, including annual reviews (see para. 2.13). Detailed terms of&#13;
reference have been prepared and agreed for the preparation of action plans for road safety and&#13;
reduction of lead in petrol. The gradual transfer of maintenance activities from force account to&#13;
contract has started under the Transport Project and will be developed further under this project.&#13;
Enterprises for repairs and works (ARL) will be separated from the administration and&#13;
commercialized with a view to privatization in the future. Separation has started with ARL Cluj.&#13;
H.  Role of the Bank and Lending Strategy&#13;
1.18        A revised Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is presently being submitted for Board&#13;
consideration. It focuses on support for a far reaching reform program in line with country priorities,&#13;
and assigns special importance to support for EU accession programs and to strengthening&#13;
partnerships with the EU and other external parties. At the same time, the strategy posits a future&#13;
shift from infrastructure lending. This operation has been designed with these strategic objectives in&#13;
mind. Thus it promotes the financial sustainability of the sector through the Road Fund (para. 2.13),&#13;
cements the strong partnerships that had been developed under the ongoing Transport Project by&#13;
continuing the close and fruitful collaboration with EBRD, EIB and EU-Phare (para. 3.12), pursues&#13;
safety and environmental improvements and by funding roads in the European network and utilizing&#13;
EU standards (para. 3.3) will facilitate EU accession. The ultimate goal is a balanced and cost&#13;
efficient transport system, that would maximize the positive externalities of providing convenient and&#13;
economic access to transportation services to the greatest number of people, while minimizing the&#13;
negative externalities such as the number and severity of accidents and the impact on the environment.&#13;
It builds upon the 1993 Transport Project (para. 1.15).&#13;

II. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR&#13;
A. Infrastructure&#13;
2.1        Network and Traffic.  Public roads in Romania are classified in a three-tier system:&#13;
national roads, district roads and communal roads. The National Administration of Roads (NAR) is&#13;
responsible for the national road network. The district and communal roads are directly under the&#13;
local administrations, however, NAR provides technical assistance on standards, project design and&#13;
budget submissions.&#13;
2.2        In 1996, the road network totalled about 73,000 km of which 15,000 km were national&#13;
roads.&#13;

* (Excluding street networks)&#13;
2.3        In the past, roads and road transport were neglected as emphasis was placed on rail&#13;
transport. As a result, the condition of the network deteriorated, particularly in the 1980s. It is&#13;
estimated that about one third of the national road network, 5000 km, require some form of&#13;
strengthening to avoid failure. The Transport Project -- Loan 3593-RO included the rehabilitation of&#13;
about 1,100 km of national roads and works will be completed in 1997. The proposed project&#13;
continues to focus on the urgent need to strengthen the national road network, which now carries 60%&#13;
of the total road traffic in the country and all international transit traffic.&#13;
2.4        Road traffic grew continuously until 1980. However, it fell by about 20% in the 1980s&#13;
when fuel was rationed and stricter restrictions applied to road transport, i.e. trucks and buses could&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
only operate within district boundaries and all transport beyond 50 km had to be by rail. In 1990,&#13;
traffic was 46% above 1989 levels, with all the increase due to private cars, but it fell again in 1991,&#13;
following fuel price increases. Since then, traffic growth has followed a more regular and expected&#13;
trend, in line with the large increase in vehicle registration (see below). Forecasts can be made with&#13;
somewhat more confidence now that economic growth has resumed. Examples from other countries&#13;
indicate that once growth resumes, road traffic can be expected to grow faster than GDP from the&#13;
present relatively low levels.&#13;
2.5         Detailed traffic surveys, including Origin-Destination surveys are conducted once every&#13;
five years on the entire national road network, with the last one in 1995. In the intervening years,&#13;
continuous traffic counting is performed at over 350 locations on the network. Traffic composition is&#13;
assumed constant between two detailed surveys. To improve the system, the Transport Project&#13;
included the acquisition of some classification counters to provide continuous data on traffic&#13;
composition which are being installed. Less than 10% of the network has traffic levels in excess of&#13;
6,000 vehicles per day (vpd) and less than 3% has over 10,000 vpd.&#13;

2.6         Highway Administration and Organization.  Construction, maintenance and&#13;
administration of the national road network is the responsibility of NAR which is a regie autonome&#13;
under the control of MOT and is at present dependent on the budget for almost all its resources (some&#13;
revenue is derived directly from bridge tolls, transit permits and overloading charges levied at frontier&#13;
posts). Its present organization is shown in Charts 1 and 2. The field organization consists of 7&#13;
regional directorates further divided into 41 sections, their borders coinciding with those of&#13;
administrative districts judets). Each section is divided into 4 to 6 districts for routine and winter&#13;
maintenance. In addition, there are some 140 "formations" for periodic resurfacing and&#13;
strengthening, each one equipped with one asphalt plant and the corresponding transport and paving&#13;
equipment. Other equipment is held at the district level. There are small workshops for maintenance&#13;
and minor repairs in each of the 41 sections and 7 regional workshops for major overhauls. All&#13;
resources - equipment, personnel, building, used for periodic maintenance are currently being&#13;
privatized. The plan to be executed under the project with EBRD financing is described in paragraph&#13;
2.10&#13;
2.7         Engineering, Construction and Maintenance.  Engineering for the road system has&#13;
generally been prepared by institutes of the MOT, the main one being the Design Institute for Road,&#13;
Water and Air Transport (IPTANA). In 1990, these institutes became joint-stock commercial&#13;
companies. The stock is still owned by the state but they are candidates for privatization. Private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
engineering consultants have emerged, often in joint-venture with foreign consultants working on the&#13;
Transport Project and are competing with the institutes for work by contract . Road design standards&#13;
are barely appropriate to traffic flows and physical characteristics, and upgrading is required to reach&#13;
EU standards. The cross sections adopted for the proposed project involve a wider paved shoulder&#13;
for safety and capacity reasons.&#13;
2.8        In the past, road construction was done by specialized groups under the MOT, with&#13;
some specialization by mode. There were national companies as well as regional ones for the smaller&#13;
works. In 1990, these large construction groups were divided into smaller commercial companies in&#13;
a way similar to that described above for the institutes. A number of them have won bids under the&#13;
Transport Project, both on their own and in joint-ventures with foreign partners. The latter are&#13;
benefitting from technical assistance and technology transfer, which will increase their potential for&#13;
eventual privatization. The project will provide assistance to the construction industry following the&#13;
recommendations of an ongoing study.&#13;
2.9         Until 1993 maintenance had been done entirely by force account. Under the Transport&#13;
Project NAR started the process of gradually moving more work to contract. The process of&#13;
commercialization started in 1994 in one region (Cluj) and was extended in 1995 to the Brasov and&#13;
Constanta regions. Periodic maintenance in these regions is carried out by a separate organization--&#13;
the Enterprise for Repairs and Works (ARL). Each year, a contract is negotiated between the&#13;
regional directorate and the ARL for specific maintenance work. Accounting practices based on&#13;
commercial principles are being used increasingly in the ARLs. However, a constraint to further&#13;
commercialization is inadequate equipment in the ARLs.&#13;
2.10        An action plan for commercialization is being prepared with the assistance of EBRD&#13;
under the proposed project. The plan agreed with EBRD has two phases: Phase 1 will&#13;
commercialize periodic maintenance in the Cluj region in 3 steps: a) complete functional separation&#13;
of all periodic maintenance activities; b) setting up of a state owned joint-stock company within MOT;&#13;
and c) privatization of the company at an appropriate time in the future. Phase 2 will extend the&#13;
process to other regions where ARLs are at various stages of development. The EBRD component&#13;
also includes the establishment of an equipment financing facility, under which NAR would purchase&#13;
equipment and lease it to the ARL's as they are privatized, recovering its cost over time from works&#13;
it contracts with the ARLs.&#13;
2.11        Highway Expenditure and Financing.  Total road expenditures (recurrent and&#13;
capital) have been fairly constant between 1985 and 1991, fluctuating between US$260 to 300 million&#13;
per year. The distribution of these between the national roads and the rest of the network has also&#13;
been stable around 50-50. Most of the capital expenditures have gone to improving and strengthening&#13;
existing roads rather than new construction. Priority has been given to basic routine maintenance and&#13;
keeping the road surface in as good condition as possible at the least cost.&#13;

The annual average of exchange rates, as published by the National Bank of Ronania was used&#13;
2.12          Until 1996 road user charges consisted of: annual vehicle license fees; vehicle&#13;
registration fees; a 5% tax on the ex-refinery price of fuels and various fees and tolls. The level of&#13;
taxation was low and total revenues amounted to some US$63 million in 1992, with about half of it&#13;
from fuel taxes. In recent years as the price of fuel was gradually reduced in constant terms, fuel tax&#13;
revenues did not increased in parallel with traffic and fuel consumption. Revenues from tolls and&#13;
transit fees, however almost doubled since 1992. Fuel prices were increased substantially in July&#13;
1996 and again in January 1997 (Table 2.1).&#13;
2.13          A Road Fund Law was promulgated on October 2, 1996 based on a 25%  charge on ex-&#13;
refinery prices of fuels and a 10% charge on ex-factory prices of vehicles. This would generate&#13;
revenues of some US$200 million per year starting in 1997, growing with traffic and vehicle&#13;
purchases. This amount, combined with about US$35 million in various fees and tolls, would be&#13;
sufficient to cover the variable costs of the network, but would fall short of covering total road costs,&#13;
which are estimated at around US$400 to 450 million per year. The combination of the proposed fuel&#13;
tax and the existing annual license fees would also be sufficient to cover the variable costs of each&#13;
vehicle type, except for the heaviest trucks. The existing annual license fee, which has not been&#13;
incorporated into the road fund, should, nevertheless, also be gradually increased, particularly for&#13;
heavy vehicles as the fuel tax typically cannot cover fully the cost they impose to the roads. A&#13;
modification to the Road Fund Law, that would introduce such an annual licence fee, is under&#13;
preparation. Table 2.2 shows NAR's revenues and expenditures from 1994-2003. At Negotiations.&#13;
Government confirmed its agreement to hold annual consultations by November 30 of each year on&#13;
the Borrower's proposed budget and expenditures program for its national road network and confirm&#13;
that any investments in its national roads network. estimated to cost US$6.000.000 equivalent or more&#13;
shall be carried out only if determined to be economically viable in accordance with criteria agreed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
with the Bank (para. 5.1 (a)). Acceptable criteria means that investments estimated to cost US$6&#13;
million or more should have an economic rate of return no less than 15% calculated in accordance&#13;
with a methodology and procedures acceptable to the Bank. All costs and benefits will be estimated&#13;
net-of-tax, and net cost and benefit streams will be developed taking into account the alternative&#13;
investment scenarios considered, and related maintenance costs.&#13;
B. Road Transport&#13;
2.14        Transport.  Road transport was completely deregulated in 1990 for freight and&#13;
passenger services. Transporters are now free to enter and operate any route they wish and determine&#13;
their own tariffs. The single large road transport company under MOT and the other 423 own-&#13;
account transport companies operated by various ministries for their own sectors have been&#13;
transformed in smaller units (average of 280 vehicles per company versus 500 in 1989) as follows:&#13;
the freight companies are commercial companies with state ownership of capital (share companies),&#13;
while the 55 passenger companies are Regies Autonomes administered by the 41 districts and the&#13;
Municipality of Bucharest. In addition to these state owned companies, there are already over 2000&#13;
private transport companies generally in the form of limited liability companies. The average size of&#13;
private companies and individual transporters is small. The intention is to privatize the state owned&#13;
companies starting with those dealing with freight.&#13;
2.15        There are now over 3 million four-wheeled vehicles registered in Romania, or about&#13;
146 vehicles per 1000 population. Commercial vehicles --buses and trucks-- account for 15% of the&#13;
fleet with cars comprising the remainder. Cars are concentrated in the urban areas, with Bucharest&#13;
accounting for 20% of the registration. Despite the rapid growth of automobile ownership, traffic on&#13;
major intercity roads remains with a high proportion of heavy vehicles, often exceeding 30%.&#13;
2.16        The present legal axle load is 10 tons for a single axle on motorways and European&#13;
roads (4,500 km) and 8 tons on other roads. NAR is studying the consequences of adopting the 11.5&#13;
ton limit of the European Community for roads and bridges on European roads as well as increasing&#13;
the bearing capacity on other national roads. Trucks are only weighed at border posts and&#13;
overloading was a problem before the 1989 revolution, mostly on roads in the vicinity of large&#13;
construction sites. While the problem is less acute now, it is likely to come back with economic&#13;
development. The Transport Project includes the purchase of weighbridges to improve data collection&#13;
for pavement design. These are being installed. During Negotiations the Government agreed to&#13;
collect data on axle loads for 12 consecutive months beginning not later than September 30. 1997 and&#13;
presenting for the Bank's review a report on its analysis. and recommendations for a system of axle&#13;
load monitoring and control by December 31. 1998 (para. 5.1 fb)).&#13;
2.17        Romanian Automobile Registry.  The Romanian Automobile Registry (RAR) is a&#13;
national regie autonome acting as a registering authority for all road vehicles. In this capacity RAR's&#13;
main attributions are: periodic inspection of vehicles for technical fitness and emission levels;&#13;
registration; certification of all new vehicles using public roads, based on testing in RAR own&#13;
laboratories. RAR headquarters are located in Bucharest and it has 40 branches throughout the&#13;
Romanian territory. RAR benefited from US$4 million financing from the Transport Project (3593-&#13;
RO) for the supply of 40 vehicle inspection lines which now provide improved, scientifically based&#13;
vehicle testing throughout the country, and an Automotive Emission Analysis System. RAR is self&#13;
financing, taking its revenue from fees charged for vehicle inspections and certification. A US$3.9&#13;
million sub-component of the traffic safety component for testing equipment will ensure a gradual&#13;
coming into line with EU standards of domestic vehicle production which is increasing rapidly. In&#13;
view of RAR's responsibilities at a national level related to traffic safety and enviromnental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
protection, the proposed project will finance equipment for the homologation and environment test of&#13;
new vehicles. An amount for TA, would be provided within the traffic safety component through&#13;
bilateral assistance or a trust fund. This component supports Government policy of aligning with EU&#13;
standards by 2005.&#13;
2.18        Traffic Safety.  Road traffic accidents have become a serious problem since the&#13;
political changes of 1989/90. The annual number of traffic accidents, now exceeding 150,000, is&#13;
growing rapidly, and growth in motorization is expected to make a trend reversal difficult. The&#13;
growth registered from 1994 to 1995 was 37%. It is roughly estimated that some 2%-3% of the GDP&#13;
is lost in accident costs (estimated to $600 million/year). In 1996 the traffic police registered 8,930&#13;
serious accidents, causing fatality or serious injuries and 11,600 causing light injuries to the victims.&#13;
This exceeds the corresponding amount for 1992 by 12%. The annual consequences of the severe&#13;
traffic accidents are out of proportion compared to Western European countries:&#13;
* 37 fatalities per 100 injured (&lt; 10 in Western Europe)&#13;
* 8.6 fatalities per 10 000 registered vehicles (&lt; 3 in Western Europe)&#13;
* 1.22 fatalities per 10 000 inhabitants (high in relation to the low rate of car ownership)&#13;
These statistics indicate a higher risk of traffic accidents and more severe consequences than in other&#13;
CEE countries.&#13;
2.19        Institutional development has taken place in the field of traffic safety since the Bank-&#13;
sponsored study of 1993 and a Road Safety Policy Seminar sponsored by the Bank for its Eastern&#13;
Europe clients which took place in Budapest 1994. An Interministerial Council for Road Safety&#13;
(ICRS) and a permanent secretariat (SICRS) were established in 1995. The members of the ICRS,&#13;
chaired by the Minister of Transport, are leaders or authorized representatives from 11 ministries,&#13;
the Department for Local Public Administration and the General Council of Bucharest Municipality&#13;
which ensures the commitment to traffic safety on high level. The ICRS has so far approved a&#13;
preliminary Priority Actions Program 1996-2000 for traffic safety based on the proposals of five&#13;
Special Traffic Safety Commissions. A new road code has been submitted to Parliament for&#13;
approval.&#13;
2.20        Defining objectives and targets for traffic safety, improving the cooperation between the&#13;
entities involved in traffic safety development, establishing the performance indicators for traffic&#13;
safety activities and monitoring these requires a clear logical framework and increased attention of the&#13;
ICRS. Assignment of responsibilities needs adjustment to ensure that all major aspects are being&#13;
covered. Lack of staff experienced in traffic safety work, lack of equipment and lack of funds&#13;
hampers all systematic approach in spite of the established high level commitment to traffic safety&#13;
and substantial efforts made by the Traffic Police, the SICRS and the Romanian Automobile Registry&#13;
(RAR) to reduce the number and the consequences of accidents. Assistance will be provided to NAR&#13;
in locating and addressing accident "black spots" i.e. locations on the road network where the number&#13;
and the consequences of a certain type of traffic accident substantially exceeds the average under&#13;
similar traffic conditions elsewhere. Particularly high traffic accident incidence is due to the poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
traffic environment of the typical Romanian "linear villages"' and the suburbs of the cities. High&#13;
accident susceptibility due to poor traffic environment is also found on the designated European Road&#13;
Network (TERN) where slow motorized transport, animal drawn transport and other non motorized&#13;
transport (NMT) generally are using the same carriageway as the growing number of buses, trucks&#13;
and small cars traveling at increased speed. The proposed project includes a traffic safety component&#13;
addressing the above issues (see Annex 3).&#13;
C. Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.21          Lead in Petrol.   Romanian refineries currently add about 0.60 g of lead in the form&#13;
of tetra-ethyl lead or tetra-methyl lead per liter of petrol as an inexpensive way to enhance the octane&#13;
levels to meet the demands of the motor fleet. The lead content of Romanian petrol is high compared&#13;
to other Eastern European countries (0.60 g/l versus 0.15 g/l in Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland). Due&#13;
to the strong correlation between lead exposure and health effects, the government has taken a keen&#13;
interest to reduce the amount of lead in petrol. The reduction in lead in petrol is planned in three&#13;
phases. In Phase I, the aim is to reduce the current lead level of 0.6 gm/l to 0.32 gm/l in the short&#13;
term (by 1998). In Phase II, at a medium term (less than 5 years) the level will be further reduced to&#13;
0.15 gm/I to meet EU standards. In Phase III, in the longer term, the plan is to move towards the&#13;
use of unleaded gasoline keeping in mind that below the 0.15 g/liter threshold, the incremental cost&#13;
per unit of lead reduction increases as the lead level decreases.&#13;
2.22          Preparation of Action Plan.   Under the Commission for Motor Vehicles, a Working&#13;
Party has been formed, including representation of Government and the vehicle manufacture and&#13;
refinery industries to develop an Action Plan to phase-out lead in petrol. Technical Assistance is&#13;
being provided to the ICRS to assist in developing the Action Plan to bring the lead content of leaded&#13;
petrol to EU standards and to phase in unleaded petrol, with suitable incentives and under a realistic&#13;
time table. During negotiations. Government confirmed that by December 31. 1997 it would submit&#13;
(through the ICRS) to the Bank a Lead Reduction Action Plan, satisfactory to the Bank and carry out&#13;
the said Action Plan in accordance with its terms (para. 5.1 (c)). The ICRS will co-ordinate activities&#13;
among key players involved in developing the Action Plan and will report to the Bank on progress.&#13;
The Action Plan includes technical options and its economic implications for the refinery, the effects&#13;
of reduced leaded petrol on the existing fleet, pricing policies related to providing incentives in using&#13;
unleaded petrol, and increasing public awareness on the benefits of using reduced leaded petrol.&#13;
1/ Unlike medieval villages, where peasants were concentrated in nuclear villages for mutual security, travelling to and from their land by day, Romania's&#13;
villages are linear in layout with houses facing the snan roads with the owner's land in the form of a long thin strip, typically 25-50m wide, stretching out&#13;
behind the hous. This produces long thin villages often 5km from start to finish of the built-up area. Because of the number and closenes of houses to&#13;
the road centre line, widening is difficult and requires the highway authority to purchase a lrge number of small plots of land each with a different owner.&#13;
Widening without acquiring land, increases vehicle speeds and decreases the space for pedestrians, maring accidents inevitable and life for the vilagers&#13;
unpleasant. Because of the linear nature of the villages, bypasses would seldom be economic. This presents a serious traffic safety dilmma.&#13;
&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
3.1     The objectives of the project are to:&#13;
a)  improve traffic safety and the fitness of the vehicle fleet;&#13;
b)  continue helping Romania to meet the changing pattern of demand for land transport&#13;
infrastructure;&#13;
c)  improve the management and performance of NAR;&#13;
d)  assist the Romanian civil works construction industry in its transition to a market&#13;
economy; and&#13;
e)  promote the reduction of lead in petrol.&#13;
In addition the project would assist Romania to harmonize the standards of its road network,&#13;
its vehicles and their safety and the institutional practices of NAR with those of the&#13;
European Union.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
3.2     Project Description. The project will consist of five components:&#13;
a)  a program of about 1,000 km of road and bridge rehabilitation; to include overlaying or&#13;
reconstruction on the existing alignment, some widening, construction of hard shoulders&#13;
and minor geometric improvements;&#13;
b)  a traffic safety program (TSP); involving components in education, engineering (roads&#13;
and vehicles) and enforcement; (see Annex 3 for a full description)&#13;
c)  a program of institution building involving computerization of NAR and the introduction&#13;
of bridge and pavement management systems; transport planning; continuation of work&#13;
towards contracting out/privatizing of periodic maintenance and installation of&#13;
permanent traffic counting and axle load controls;&#13;
d)  a program of assistance to the civil works construction industry, including establishment&#13;
of a secretariat; training programs and financing of equipment; and&#13;
e)  preparation of an Action Plan for the reduction of lead in petrol.&#13;
3.3     Road and bridge rehabilitation is vital in Romania as its contact with Western Europe with&#13;
its higher axle loads and emphasis on road transport makes its impact. Roads have been selected&#13;
from the European network, including portions of the Trans European Networks (TEM, "the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
corridors") as a result of feasibility studies (see below). The work will consist of strengthening to&#13;
carry 11 tonnes per axle, the EU standard, mostly by overlaying with asphaltic concrete, and by the&#13;
addition of wider shoulders of which 1 m will be paved. This is essential for safety (there is still a&#13;
significant proportion of non-motorized transport (NMT), including animal drawn vehicles, and slow&#13;
moving agricultural machinery), to permit overtaking thus providing capacity for the rising traffic&#13;
volumes, and to reduce shoulder maintenance.&#13;
3.4     The Bridge Repair Program. Bridges needing repair or widening, contained in lengths of&#13;
road being improved will be included in the respective contracts, but there will also be a stand alone&#13;
bridge rehabilitation program. This will involve some 50 bridges, and works will consist mostly of&#13;
replacement of expansion joints and re-waterproofing of decks. Works will be identified and&#13;
scheduled by the RD's (regional directorates) with assistance from local consulting engineers if&#13;
required. Contracts will be managed by RDs. Some small bridge repairs will be done by force&#13;
account for which the loan would finance materials such as joints and water proofing membrane.&#13;
Technical Assistance and the equipment purchase program will combine to upgrade, modernize and&#13;
re-equip the whole of NAR's bridge maintenance activities, served by a new bridge management&#13;
system to be introduced at the same time.&#13;
3.5     The traffic safety program (TSP) is described in detail in Annex 3. Activities in&#13;
engineering, enforcement and education will be pursued under the coordination of SICRS. Many&#13;
traffic safety efforts fail because of poor cooperation among the many actors; an important feature of&#13;
the TSP is therefore a pilot scale traffic safety demonstration project. In the important and heavily&#13;
trafficked corridor between Bucharest an Brasov, all the actors in the traffic safety field have agreed&#13;
to cooperate on an integrated project to show how the contribution of each component fits into the&#13;
whole. Technical assistance will be obtained from a major European traffic safety organization,&#13;
which would be able to call on the entirety of its home country's traffic safety services, as and when&#13;
needed. The pilot study findings and other subcomponents will be used to prepare a National Traffic&#13;
Safety Action Plan 2000-2009. Among the many agencies involved in the component will be RAR,&#13;
which already received assistance under the ongoing project to set up a nationwide chain of vehicle&#13;
inspection stations. This assistance, coordinated by SICRS, will be continued in the proposed project&#13;
in the area of standardization and quality control of new vehicle production, in line with EU&#13;
standards. During Negotiations Government reconfirmed its agreement to: 1) maintain at all times&#13;
until the completion of the Project. the ICRS and SICRS with a sufficient number of qualified staff&#13;
and adequate facilities, as satisfactory to the Bank: 2) (a) carry out the TSP with due diligence and&#13;
efficiency: (b) review with the Bank. by June 30 of each year. the progress achieved in the carrying&#13;
out of such a program: and (c) within four months of each such review, update the program and,&#13;
thereafter. implement all measures required to ensure the efficient carrying out thereof during the&#13;
period after such review. taking into consideration the Bank's comments on the matter: and 3) (i) by&#13;
December 31. 1999. submit (through the ICRS) to the Bank. for its review, a draft National Traffic&#13;
Safety Action Plan: (ii) immediately thereafter finalize said Action Plan taking into consideration the&#13;
Bank's comments on such a draft: and (iii) carry out said Action Plan in accordance with its terms&#13;
(inara 5.1 (d)).&#13;
3.6    Institution building in NAR will include bringing the pavement management system&#13;
developed under the previous project up to operational level, to serve as a basis for maintenance&#13;
works decisions, and introducing a bridge management system. A small cell will be established for&#13;
advanced planning, which will put together traffic volume and weight data from automated stations&#13;
now being installed, physical performance data from the PMS and BMS, and using Highway Design&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Model (HDM) 4 and similar software serve as a tool to monitor the development of weak or&#13;
congested sections, to serve as a basis for the investment program. Computerization will be completed&#13;
and an NAR-wide cost accounting system will be installed (funded by EBRD). The periodic&#13;
maintenance activities of NAR and the related equipment are being commercialized and eventually&#13;
will be privatized. The project will provide equipment, software and technical assistance for this work&#13;
(funded by EBRD), and some equipment will also be provided for routine maintenance activities&#13;
remaining with NAR (funded by IBRD).&#13;
3.7     Assistance to the civil works construction industry will be based on the recommendations of&#13;
a study of Romania's civil works construction industry, which is being financed from the Transport&#13;
Project. The draft final report will be completed in the next few weeks. The component would&#13;
provide technical assistance in contract management, and financial management and control of&#13;
enterprises, to a technical secretariat to be established in the Association of Romanian Contractors.&#13;
The study is also likely to recommend various measures to improve the business and contractual&#13;
climate in which contractors operate, such as access to foreign exchange, import procedures and a&#13;
price adjustment clause in standard public sector works contracts that correctly reflects price changes.&#13;
These changes are expected to bring Romania's practices more in line with those of the European&#13;
community.&#13;
3.8     Reduction of lead in petrol will be brought about by the efforts of a working group&#13;
coordinated by SICRS to which the project will provide technical assistance (see paras 2.21,2.22).&#13;
The work will lead to the preparation of a national action plan for the reduction of the lead in leaded&#13;
petrol and the making available under price incentives of unleaded petrol by December 31, 1997.&#13;
C. Engineering and Status of Project Preparation&#13;
3.9     Feasibility studies for the major road rehabilitation works were performed on a "long list" of&#13;
some 2,500 km of roads in the E (European) network, from which about 1,000 km were selected by&#13;
the Government and the co-financiers in May 1996 for final design2. Table 3.1 shows the road&#13;
sections so far selected for World Bank financing totalling 304 km. Further road sections will be&#13;
selected from these or subsequent studies in consultation with the Bank; criteria of eligibility will be&#13;
an acceptable feasibility study, an economic rate of return not lower than 15% and a satisfactory&#13;
environmental clearance. The sections already selected for Bank financing have ERRs between 39&#13;
and 62 percent. One road section to be financed by EIB/PHARE, with a lower ERR has been selected&#13;
nevertheless because of its importance as part of EU Corridor #4. Design work is being carried out&#13;
by two consortia of consulting engineers, both comprising an international firm and a Romanian firm.&#13;
Complete contract documents for bids were sent to the Bank in January 1997. Designs and contract&#13;
documents for the bridge repair program are being prepared by NAR's regional directorates (RD's)&#13;
with the assistance of local consultant where necessary. A General Procurement Notice was published&#13;
on July 16, 1996 and prequalification for ICB contracts is well advanced. Specifications for road&#13;
maintenance equipment are being prepared by NAR. TORs for the major consultancies are&#13;
substantially complete.&#13;
2/ Pre-investment studies and design are being financed from Loan 3593-RO.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
D. Cost Estimates&#13;
3.10    The estimated total cost of the project is US$553 million equivalent. Detailed costs are&#13;
shown in Table 3.4. Construction cost estimates are those prepared by the design consultants, based&#13;
on outturn prices from ongoing contracts and include a 20% contingency because of the inherent&#13;
uncertainties in rehabilitation work; the foreign/local breakdown is based on consultants' estimates.&#13;
The local component includes import duties on equipment (about 15 percent for construction&#13;
equipment), VAT (currently 18 percent) and other taxes and duties, amounting to a total of US$97&#13;
million. Costs of technical assistance, study travel abroad, computers and equipment are based on&#13;
experience under the ongoing project or consultations with manufacturers.&#13;
3.11    In view of domestic inflation, price contingencies are based on cost estimates expressed in&#13;
US dollars, and use the latest estimates of the Index of Unit Value of Manufactured Exports (MUV),&#13;
averaged at 2.4 per cent per annum over the life of the project. Physical contingencies for civil&#13;
works are assumed at 20% but for other items are not separately identified, and the amounts shown&#13;
for each item are regarded as budgets not to be exceeded, however engineers' estimates include&#13;
varying assumptions on quantities built in, depending on the terrain and degree of difficulty.&#13;
E. Project Financing&#13;
3.12    The proposed IBRD loan of US$150 million would finance about 27 percent of total project&#13;
cost. The Borrower will be Romania, with onlending to NAR.  The European Investment Bank&#13;
(EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) will be financing about&#13;
$87.5 million and $85.9 million equivalent, respectively. The remaining $214 million including all&#13;
taxes and duties, will be financed by Government. A fourth source of finance for this project is&#13;
expected to be the European Commission's PHARE Fund (EU-PHARE) which would finance most of&#13;
the road safety and institutional development components with grant financing of about US$16&#13;
million, and may as the program develops, finance up to 30 percent of Government's contribution to&#13;
the road rehabilitation component, up to a maximum of about US$60 million. Any amount in this&#13;
later category would be as a substitution for GOR funds, and therefore would not increase any totals&#13;
shown in the cost table. PHARE has its own procedures based on annual programs and funds are&#13;
unlikely to be available until late 1997. During Negotiations. the fiscal viability of the proposed level&#13;
of Government contributions was reconfirmed. Government also confirmed that it would meet all&#13;
local costs including cost overruns and any shortfall in foreign exchange (para. 5.1 (e)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
3.13    A financing plan has been developed and is shown below:&#13;

TOTAL                  326           227           553&#13;
F. Implementation and Monitoring&#13;
3.14     Overall direction of the project will be handled by the existing project management unit&#13;
(PMU) now consisting of senior officers of NAR, SNCFR and RAR, without the SNCFR members to&#13;
which will be added the Director, ICRS. ICRS has five commissions staffed by members of&#13;
participating agencies, industry and research institutes, the chairmen of which in committee, will&#13;
function as a sub-PMU for the safety component. Terms of Reference for the PMU are given in&#13;
Annex 1. During Negotiations Government confirmed that the PMU will be maintained and suitably&#13;
staffed throughout the life of the project (para. 5.1 (f\). At the detailed level, the project will be&#13;
implemented by project implementation units PIU's with sub-PIU's in each implementing agency.&#13;
Overall control of accounting and disbursements will be handled by the PIU established in NAR for&#13;
the ongoing project, which is efficient and experienced. SICRS and RAR will handle procurement&#13;
related to the "improvement of technical vehicle standards" component. The roads component&#13;
including black spots will be managed by NAR, who will also give advice to other agencies on&#13;
procurement. The traffic safety component will be coordinated by the secretariat of the ICRS&#13;
(SICRS) which will function as a PIU. Limited technical assistance will be provided to the PIU's in&#13;
their first year of operation, financed by EU-PHARE (see below). TOR's for this assistance are also&#13;
given in Annex 1. As the other donors are ahead of the Bank in their loan processing and as&#13;
prequalification is already underway and designs are ready, it is proposed to provide for retroactive&#13;
financing and advance contractin2 up to $15 million, with effect from November 30. 1996. A set of&#13;
monitoring indicators has been developed (Annex 4) and progress reports will list these indicators and&#13;
show their status. NAR's PIU will continue to provide quarterly progress reports using the format&#13;
developed for the ongoing project, which is satisfactory. Other agencies will be responsible for&#13;
providing information on their components to NAR's PIU.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
G. Procurement&#13;
3.15     Procurement arrangements for the Bank-financed elements of the project are detailed in the&#13;
Procurement Schedule (Annex 2), and Table 3.5 and the Project Implementation Plan (Annex 6). All&#13;
procurement financed by the proposed loan will follow the appropriate Bank Guidelines for goods,&#13;
works and consultants. Prequalification is using a document based on EBRD's standard document&#13;
which is essentially identical to the Bank's but with IBRD's eligibility criteria. Both EBRD and IBRD&#13;
will use a document for works based on SBDW of January 1995, thus reducing the preparation work&#13;
for the PIU. Prior review levels are shown in Annex 2. During Negotiations. agreement was&#13;
reached on the procurement procedures (para. 5.1 (g)). A Country Procurement Assessment report&#13;
has not yet been prepared for Romania, but all procurement will be based on IBRD standard bidding&#13;
documents.&#13;
H. Disbursements&#13;
3.16     The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed as follows:&#13;
Category   Description                 Amount ($m)  % of expenditures financed&#13;
I         Road and Bridge Works                 125  100% of foreign expenditures and&#13;
60% of local expenditures&#13;
2         Equipment                              13  100% of foreign expenditures,&#13;
100% of local expenditures (ex&#13;
factory cost), and 80% of local&#13;
expenditures for other items&#13;
l_________________________                 procured   locally&#13;

4         Unallocated                             8&#13;
ILTOTAL                                          150&#13;
3.17     A schedule of disbursements is given in Table 3.6 which is based on the appropriate&#13;
historical profile giving a 6.5 year disbursement period. This is longer than for the ongoing project&#13;
because of Government's wish to spread its contribution over a longer period. As disbursement&#13;
performance has been good under the ongoing loan, disbursements may go faster. Disbursements&#13;
would be made against Statement of Expenditure (SOEs) for contracts less than (a) $4 million&#13;
equivalent for road works; (b) $500,000 equivalent for bridge works; (c) $100,000 for consulting&#13;
firms; and (d) $50,000 for individual consultants. For all contracts above these limits full&#13;
documentation would be required. To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account will be established&#13;
at a bank in Romania that is acceptable to IBRD. The Account will be managed by the National&#13;
Administration of Roads' (NAR's) PIU. The authorized allocation for the Account will be $8.5&#13;
million, equivalent to about four months of expenditures under the loan. The initial deposit will be&#13;
limited to $1.7 million and the remaining portions of the allocations will be disbursed when the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
project has built up sufficient turnover to justify drawing on the full amount, defined as when the total&#13;
of withdrawals for the Loan Account plus the value of any Special Commitments made against the&#13;
loan are equivalent to $25 million. Application for replenishment of the Special Account would be&#13;
submitted on a monthly basis or when one half of the amount deposited had been withdrawn&#13;
whichever occurred earlier, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate&#13;
supporting documents. All other applications for direct payment, special commitment or&#13;
reimbursement should be for amounts not less than 10% of the initial deposit of the authorized&#13;
allocations to the Special Accounts or not less than 10% of the full authorized allocations once&#13;
available. Submissions of replenishment applications take precedence over the minimum size&#13;
application. The project is expected to be completed by March 31, 2003, and the loan closing date&#13;
would be September 30, 2003.&#13;
1. Project Supervision&#13;
3.18     NAR and RAR are successfully implementing their parts of the ongoing project, so two&#13;
missions a year plus ongoing support from the Resident Mission will be sufficient to supervise the&#13;
components assigned to them. The traffic safety component with its dependence on collaboration&#13;
between agencies not so far used to working together, will require three missions a year, the third by&#13;
the traffic safety specialist until it is running smoothly. Procurement documents and&#13;
withdrawal/replenishment applications will be reviewed by the assigned project officer in the resident&#13;
mission before being forwarded to Headquarters, reducing the amount of work required on&#13;
supervision. Until the end of 1998, missions will be combined with missions for the ongoing project.&#13;
For the safety component, missions will consist of the traffic safety engineer and the task manager,&#13;
and for highway missions, the task manager and the transport economist. Two missions by ECi's&#13;
environment specialist will be required. Mission frequency and duration are expected to reduce in the&#13;
outer years. In sum, supervision of the proposed project would require about 100 staff weeks in&#13;
FY97 to FY 2003.&#13;
J. Environmental Impact&#13;
3.19         The project has been classified as Category 'B' under the Bank's Operational&#13;
Directive 4.01 which implies that limited environmental assessment would be required. The project&#13;
involves rehabilitation and widening of existing roads only and does not include any realignment.&#13;
Since the project would be limited to the existing right of way, there are no concerns related to the&#13;
resettlement of displaced persons. The project does not affect any archaeological or historic sites.&#13;
The project will contribute towards improving traffic flow and vehicles will travel at optimum speeds&#13;
lowering the fuel consumption rate. Smoother road pavements will reduce the wear and tear of&#13;
vehicles and lower levels of metals and other micro-particles normally found in the vicinity of roads.&#13;
Improved vehicle flow and an asphalt concrete surfacing will also contribute towards lower noise&#13;
levels. The project has a comprehensive safety component that will identify and ameliorate the black&#13;
points that cause accidents.&#13;
3.20         The EA for this project was performed in two stages. In Phase I, during the&#13;
feasibility study of the project, background environmental data was collected. Also, possible minor&#13;
environmental effects in certain areas were identified which included removal of trees and the&#13;
interference with the existing surface water and ground water flows. During Phase II, detailed&#13;
mitigative plans were developed which included replanting of trees and installation of proper drainage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
systems. To minimize environmental effects during construction, the roads will be watered to reduce&#13;
dust levels and noise and emission control measures will be used on the equipments. The EA&#13;
procedures followed in the project are consistent with Romanian regulations and Bank Operational&#13;
Directives.&#13;
K. Project Accounts and Auditing&#13;
3.21       NAR's PIU will have overall responsibility for project accounts and loan reimbursement&#13;
and withdrawal applications. Other agencies--RAR, SICRS will maintain accounts for their project&#13;
activities, and provide information to NAR. All project accounts, statements of expenditure and the&#13;
special account and sub account and NAR's financial statements, as a regies autonome, will be&#13;
audited annually, and a report of the audit will be sent to Washington by June 30 of the following&#13;
year. During Negotiations agreement was reached that (a) all documents to sunport project&#13;
expenditures would be maintained by the Borrower, and made available to the Bank for review (5.01&#13;
(h): and (b) all project accounts including the SOEs and the Special Account and NAR's financial&#13;
statements will be audited annually. by independent auditors and audit reports acceptable to the Bank&#13;
will be submitted six months after the close of the fiscal year (para 5.01 (i)).&#13;
L.  Proverty Impact&#13;
3.22     The project will not have a significant direct impact on poverty. The Bank has prepared a&#13;
Social Protection Loan that is being submitted to the Board for consideration to help address poverty&#13;
issues, which presently are a significant concern in Romania. The project, however, will have&#13;
indirect benefits for the population at large: lower transportation costs would lower the costs of basic&#13;
food staples and of energy inputs, which weigh heavily on the budgets of poor families. Traffic&#13;
safety improvements will benefit pedestrians and NMT, which include many of the poor; furthermore&#13;
this segment of the population lacks the resources for sound medical treatment following road&#13;
accidents. Finally, the reduction of lead in petrol has an important potential benefit for children, as&#13;
there is medical evidence linking exposure to lead to mental development.&#13;

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A. Framework&#13;
4.1           Rehabilitation of infrastructure after many years of inadequate maintenance, and in&#13;
face of significant traffic growth prospects, is an important economic priority. To achieve this&#13;
objective under the present budget, managerial and institutional constraints, the Bank and EBRD have&#13;
agreed to support a gradual strategy. The ultimate goal is a balanced and cost efficient transport&#13;
system, that would maximize the positive externalities of providing convenient and economic access to&#13;
transportation services to the greatest number of people, while minimizing the negative externalities&#13;
such as the number and severity of accidents and the impact on the environment. Other CAS&#13;
priorities are to raise efficiency of public sector management, reduce the state role in the economy,&#13;
open critical areas to private sector participation, promote EU accession and address environmental&#13;
issues (para. 1.18). The proposed project addresses all the above priorities as explained in more&#13;
details in Chapters 2 and 3. It builds upon the 1993 Transport Project, which is being implemented&#13;
in a satisfactory manner.&#13;
4.2           The Government has made substantial progress in adopting market-based transport&#13;
policies since the start of economic transformation in 1990, and there are no major policy distortions&#13;
that will affect the implementation of the project. Further details are in para 1.8 and 1.12 for&#13;
measures taken and policies in the transport sector in general and in Chapter 2 for more specifics on&#13;
road and road transport. Besides the rehabilitation of infrastructure, the proposed project will&#13;
continue and deepen the support to policy decisions in the areas of contracting out civil works&#13;
including for maintenance, working through the Road Fund to ensure a stable funding basis for the&#13;
sector that relies on road user charges, modernizing rules and regulations in the subsector; and&#13;
improving traffic safety.&#13;
4.3           By lowering transport costs, the project benefits are expected to be widely dispersed&#13;
throughout the economy. Savings in vehicle operating costs will initially be captured by intermediate&#13;
producers such as truckers and bus operators as well as directly by consumers as car users. Because&#13;
the road transport sector is now competitive, most of the intermediate savings will be passed on to the&#13;
final consumers of goods transported, to the benefit of all income groups. Reduced transport costs&#13;
will also make exports more competitive. Also, the present value of road expenditures will be&#13;
reduced by undertaking road strengthening now and avoiding more expensive reconstruction at a later&#13;
date. Road maintenance expenditures will also decrease on rehabilitated and strengthened roads. The&#13;
road safety component of the project will reduce the cost of accidents on the economy at large. The&#13;
environmental impact of the project is expected to be minimal, since it deals with rehabilitation of&#13;
existing roads. On the positive side, reduced fuel consumption on improved roads will contribute to&#13;
lower pollution, and gradual reductions of the lead content of petrol should result in significant health&#13;
benefits.&#13;
B. Cost-Benefit Analysis&#13;
4.4           Road Rehabilitation.  The 1,000 km of roads to be rehabilitated under the project&#13;
have been selected on the basis of detailed feasibility studies of over 2,500 km of national roads to&#13;
establish priorities for this project. The main criterion used for selecting the roads for the project is&#13;
that the economic rate of return should be above 15%. Consideration was also given to the strategic&#13;
importance of the roads to the development of Romania and to international trade and to the regional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
importance to the direct vicinity of each road. In carrying out the feasibility studies, consultants&#13;
have carefully compared alternative geometric standards and maintenance policies in terms of their&#13;
costs and benefits, with the use of the Bank's Highway Design Model (HDM-III). Feasibility Study&#13;
reports are in the Project File. All costs and benefits were evaluated in constant 1996 prices and have&#13;
been expressed in US$. Financial costs and prices have been converted into economic prices, net of&#13;
taxes and duties, but no shadow pricing has been utilized. At present, the exchange rate is freely&#13;
determined in the market. Since there is unemployment, and this is likely to continue during the&#13;
period of project implementation, had labor costs been shadow priced it is likely that economic&#13;
benefits would have been estimated to be higher.&#13;
4.5           Rehabilitation costs were estimated in function of the condition of the various roads,&#13;
determined on the basis of deflection data and existing pavement investigations carried out by&#13;
Romanian consultants for NAR in 1992-94 and of automated road analyzer (ARAN) surveys carried&#13;
out in late 1995. The ARAN surveys measure the International Roughness Index (IRI), and an array&#13;
of road conditions such as rut depth and distress situations (cracking, rutting, ravelling, potholes, etc).&#13;
For the purpose of the economic analysis, the roads analyzed where divided into links and sections of&#13;
homogeneous traffic levels and engineering characteristics. Work quantities were determined in&#13;
relation to the conditions listed above, traffic safety considerations and compliance with European&#13;
standards, especially for the width of shoulders. Regarding the latter, however, costs have been&#13;
minimized in areas where the widening would be very expensive due to utilities relocation and land&#13;
acquisition. Unit prices were based on those obtained on recent contracts being executed under the&#13;
Transport Project.&#13;
4.6           The main benefits of the projects are measured in terms of vehicle operating cost&#13;
savings. The variables affecting these are: the level and rate of growth of traffic by vehicle type and&#13;
the road conditions with and without the project. Present traffic level on the various road sections&#13;
was established by the detailed traffic counts and surveys done in 1995 by CESTRIN. Recent traffic&#13;
trends indicate a growth rate of 7% p.a. in the last few years. Typically, in countries at the level of&#13;
development of Romania, traffic growth exceed substantially the increase in GDP. Furthermore, in&#13;
Eastern Europe there is a motorization back-log which is likely to feed further traffic growth. The&#13;
Bank's forecast for Romania's GDP growth is to increase gradually, to about 2% in 1998, 3% in&#13;
1999, and 4.5% from 2001 onwards. For the project analysis, a conservative traffic growth rate of&#13;
5%, has been assumed up to the year 2000, falling to 4.5% between 2000 and 2005 and to 4.0% up&#13;
to 2015.&#13;
4.7           For calculating vehicle operating costs, the traffic has been divided into six categories&#13;
of vehicles representative of the Romanian vehicle fleet. The representative types have been derived&#13;
from a weighted average of different models considering the present composition of the fleet and its&#13;
probable future evolution. The basic characteristics of the representative types were developed from&#13;
information on vehicle operation and prices from transport operators. They were then used in the&#13;
HDM model to determine vehicle operating costs with and without the project, on the basis of road&#13;
conditions measured in the ARAN surveys mentioned above. Time savings were valued at the&#13;
predominant wage rates for drivers and working trips. Travel time savings for non-working and&#13;
leisure trips have been excluded from the analysis.&#13;
4.8           Based on the above assumptions for costs and benefits, the economic rates of return&#13;
(ERR) calculated over a 20 year period range from 39% to over 62% for roads to be rehabilitated&#13;
under the project. The weighted average ERR for the road rehabilitation component is 48%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
4.9          Traffic Safety. The World Bank's Highway Design Model HDM-III does not&#13;
evaluate the benefits related to traffic safety improvement. The implementation of the traffic safety&#13;
component will however substantially reduce the number of accidents by eliminating a large number&#13;
of traffic accident black spots, by improving driver's training, by increasing and diversifying law&#13;
enforcement, by improving traffic safety education and information etc. These activities will&#13;
accumulate substantial annual economic benefits as shown in para 4.10. Additional benefits are&#13;
anticipated to be generated from implementation of the long term Traffic Safety Plan 2000-2009,&#13;
which will be launched in 1999 as a major output of the twinning arrangement included in the project.&#13;
The civil works scheduled to be executed as part of the black spot elimination program and the two&#13;
pilot projects are calculated to reduce the annual amount of fatal accidents in the black spot locations&#13;
by a minimum of 40 (2 accidents/location/year) and subsequently, based on the present ratio of&#13;
fatalities/injuries in Romania, reduce the annual amount of injuries by more than 120. The program is&#13;
also expected to reduce the annual amount of accidents resulting in mere damage to property by at&#13;
least 50% in the black spot locations. This reduces the annual amount of such accidents by some 800.&#13;
The broad approach, which characterizes the traffic safety program, will also substantially improve&#13;
the adverse ratio of fatalities/injuries (1:2.7) and bring it closer to western European averages&#13;
(&lt; 1:10). The target of the traffic safety plan will be to reduce the annual amount of serious accidents&#13;
causing fatalities or injuries by 40% and the annual amount of accidents causing damage to property&#13;
by at least 30% by 2009. It is expected that, if no action on safety is taken, due to growing&#13;
motorization the number of injuries would rise by at least 12% a year.&#13;
4.10         The estimation of the annual economic burden to the society due to road traffic&#13;
accidents has been made based on current accident pricing in western Europe and has been adjusted&#13;
using the ratio of GDP/capita of Romania compared to that of western Europe. The following pricing&#13;
has been used&#13;
one fatality         $ 130 000&#13;
one injury           $  13 000&#13;
one light accident   $   1 000&#13;
Trhe outcome of the implementation of the 10-year Traffic Safety Plan (TSP 2000-2009) will be a&#13;
gradual reduction of the annual economic losses to the society caused by road traffic accidents. The&#13;
annual benefits are estimated to accumulate as follows:&#13;
1999 - 1.0 % of the total economic losses in 1995         $  5 million&#13;
2000 - 2.0 %          "                "                  $ 10&#13;
2001 - 4.0 %          "                "                  $ 20&#13;
A sound and stable financing for the Traffic Safety Plan 2000 - 2009 will continue to increase the&#13;
annual savings in accident costs by an additional $ 20 million/year until all activities included in the&#13;
plan have been implemented and the amount of accidents reduced by approximately 40% compared&#13;
to the situation in 1995. This target corresponds very well with long term targets being set in many&#13;
western European countries today (ref. Norway. Sweden and Finland all renowned for excellent&#13;
traffic safety achievements).&#13;
The black spot elimination program is expected to lower the amount of accident rates in black spot&#13;
locations to standard level. The annual accident costs in present black spot locations will reduce as a&#13;
consequence of the execution of the civil works program as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
1999 - 25% of total impact of the program    = $ 1.4 million&#13;
2000- 80%                                   $ 4.5&#13;
2001-100%        "                        =$ 5.6&#13;
4.11         The total costs of the proposed traffic safety activities amount to $ 24 million. The&#13;
Bank loan would finance $8.6 million and the EU-Phare program cofinancing is expected to be $11.0&#13;
million. The implementation of the proposed $24 million Traffic Safety Program would yield an&#13;
economic rate of return (ERR) of about 96%. The ERR for the civil works component of the program&#13;
only, which is the main part ($13.6 million) supported by the proposed Bank loan would be about&#13;
40%.&#13;
C. Sensitivity and Risk&#13;
4.12         There are few risks which would affect the economic rates of return of the project.&#13;
For the road rehabilitation component, the main one would be that traffic growth would be less than&#13;
expected and benefits would thus be lower than estimated. If unanticipated construction difficulties&#13;
and or delays are encountered, construction costs could be higher than expected. Sensitivity of the&#13;
ERR to these two risks and to increase maintenance costs was analyzed by reducing traffic and&#13;
therefore vehicle operating cost savings by 20% and increasing costs by 20%. The effect of either on&#13;
the ERRs is less than 20% and ERRs would still range from 32 to over 53% (see Annex 7). For the&#13;
road safety component, the risk is that the reduction of accidents will be less than expected, but the&#13;
savings of even minor reduction in accidents are so large in comparison to the level of investment that&#13;
the ERR will remain high under any scenario short of major institutional failings.&#13;
4.13         The more significant risks are of a broader institutional nature:&#13;
a)    insufficient counterpart funds. The risk has now been reduced since the Road&#13;
Fund Law has been approved as it will provide NAR with funds to&#13;
complement budget allocation. In addition the Government has undertaken&#13;
that the project will be given priority over any other investments to be&#13;
undertaken by NAR, however a residual risk does remain given Romania's&#13;
fiscal difficulties, and in anticipation of potential problems, annual&#13;
consultations on budget allocations and a mid-term review are provided under&#13;
the project;&#13;
b)    strained implementation capacity in the earlier stages of the project, while the&#13;
Transport Project is still under implementation. To reduce this risk, technical&#13;
assistance to the PMU is provided in the project;&#13;
c)    delays in implementing the agreed strategy on commercialization of periodic&#13;
maintenance operations. NAR has already started the process in 3 of its 7&#13;
regions and there is specific assistance in the project to deepen and extend the&#13;
process; and&#13;
d)    implementation of the traffic safety component is dispersed among many&#13;
different agencies not used to working together and coordination may be&#13;
difficult. The project envisages twinning of the road safety group with an&#13;
experienced partner.&#13;
With the arrangements and assurances provided under the project, risks are considered acceptable.&#13;

General Description of NAR: The public road network in Romania has a length of 153,000 km and&#13;
comprises approximately 15,000 km of national roads which are administered by the National&#13;
Administration of Roads, whereas country and communal roads ire administered by provincial authorities.&#13;
The NAR is a regie autonome with autonomous management under the Ministry of Transport (MOT).&#13;
It is staffed with approximately 15,000 employees located both at headquarters and in 7 road and bridge&#13;
regional divisions. Each regional division is managed by a gull director and a deputy director chief&#13;
engineer.&#13;
At the headquarters level the NAR is divided into five specialized departments (Maintenance Division,&#13;
Externally Funded Projects Division (DEFP), Motorways Division, Technical Division and Economic&#13;
Affairs Division).&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
The budget of the National Administration of Roads is in the region of 500 billion of Lei. The main&#13;
activity of NAR has shifted in the recent years from one of constructing roads and bridges to one of&#13;
planning, setting construction, maintenance and safety standards and specifications.&#13;
Project Management.  To manage, administer and coordinate the First Road Project, a Project&#13;
Management Unit has been established within the NAR. Its members include a Chairman and other&#13;
representatives in a managerial position of (i) the NAR (ii) the MOF, and (iii) the MOT. The PMU have&#13;
delegated parts of its day-to-day functions to the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) works whose staff&#13;
come mainly from the Department of Externally Funded Projects (DEFP and responsible for monitoring&#13;
and coordinating the activities of the Project until its completion, including the one-year guarantee&#13;
maintenance period for civil). Such an arrangement will be maintained during the Second Roads Projects&#13;
and the PIU will liaise with the IFIs in all matters concerning Project implementation and supervision.&#13;
Ever since its establishment PIU has been supported by external expertise and procedures have been&#13;
prepared and implemented to improve Project management.&#13;
The NAR intend to recruit consultants to assist in the completion of the First Road Project and in the&#13;
implementation of the Second Roads Project.&#13;
Obiectives.  The main objectives of the assignment will be to provide assistance to the Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU) established within DEFP to enable it to undertake the function of planning,&#13;
operating and monitoring during the period 1997 through to 1998.&#13;
Now that the PMU operates in an orderly manner the technical assistance is no longer required on a&#13;
permanent basis and the consultants selected for this assignment will be expected to staff the PIU on a&#13;
part-time basis in order to ensure efficient execution of the Project.&#13;
Scope of tasks:&#13;

SECOND ROADS PROJECT&#13;
TRAFFIC SAFETY PROGRAMME&#13;
Project Description&#13;
1.    Objectives&#13;
The activities within the traffic safety component aim to reduce the amount of road traffic&#13;
accidents in accident "black spots" to an acceptable "standard" level for Western Europe and by&#13;
increasing the efficiency of education and law enforcement to gradually improve the conduct of drivers&#13;
and other participants in traffic so as to reduce the rate of road traffic accidents. The project would&#13;
provide the required traffic safety know-how for producing and monitoring a Traffic Safety Plan for a&#13;
10 year period 2000 - 2009, which when implemented will reduce the amount of serious accidents by&#13;
at least 40% (saving the lives of 1,100 Romanians and keeping 3,200 Romanians from being injured in&#13;
traffic accidents annually). The project aims at establishing a permanent framework and a program for&#13;
traffic safety research and development (R&amp;D) to support further improvement of traffic safety. It is&#13;
expected that funding will be provided through the PHARE programme.&#13;
2.    The trafMic safety component consists of:&#13;
2.1    Elimination of traffic accident "black spots"&#13;
Traffic accident "black spots" are locations on the road network where the amount of traffic&#13;
accidents substantially exceeds the average amount of the same type of accidents occurring in similar&#13;
traffic conditions elsewhere. The "black spots" are evidence of poor traffic environment and should be&#13;
eliminated urgently. Recent statistics indicate that a substantial amount of accident "black spots" exists&#13;
on the rural as well as the urban road network in Romania. An substantial part of "black spots" are&#13;
located within the typical "linear villages" with mixed motorized and non-motorized traffic using the same&#13;
carriageway and uncontrolled access from the plots to the main road.&#13;
The project would provide technical assistance to NAR for identification of accident "black spots"&#13;
on the national road network and definition of the causes for accident accumulation. Technical assistance&#13;
would also be provided for compiling a priority program for improving the traffic environment and for&#13;
advising and supervision of technical design of the safety measures required in each "black spot". The&#13;
accident "black spot" elimination program would address the problems causing accidents in prioritized&#13;
road locations in most of the 41 regions but special emphasis would be put on identification and&#13;
implementation of alternative solutions for "black spot" elimination and studies related to the impact of&#13;
such designs in 6 regions, where the accident rates are high and which can be studied in connection with&#13;
the rural and urban pilot projects (ref. 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5). The pilot projects would provide the required&#13;
technical support for the research and development needed in connection with such studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -                                   Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
The proposed loan to NAR would be used for technical design and implementation of the civil&#13;
works program. Technical assistance will be provided to assist NAR with compiling a draft "black spot"&#13;
elimination program for 1997 which would be based on systematic "black spot" identification, accident&#13;
analysis, impact assessment and cost/benefit evaluations. Assistance would also be required for related&#13;
technical design. Technical assistance for identifying and evaluating the "black spot" elimination program&#13;
for 1998 would be provided through the twinning arrangement (ref. 2.9).&#13;
The PIU at NAR would procure and supervise the required consultants' services defined in the&#13;
Terms of Reference (ref. annex 5) and the civil works. The World Bank would provide technical&#13;
expertise for supervision of the urgently needed cofinanced consultants' services.&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;

Civil works and supervision                       6/98 - 10/99        $8,500,000&#13;
2.2   Improvement of technical vehicle standards&#13;
The total registered fleet of motorized 4-wheel or larger vehicles excluding tractors is 3,019,000&#13;
and the average rate of annual growth exceeds 7%. The main part of the vehicle fleet is old and a poor&#13;
level of maintenance combined with lack of vehicle inspection capacity has dropped the technical standard&#13;
of the vehicles to a level which is below satisfactory when compared with Western European standards.&#13;
Many accessories, which are mandatory and therefore standard equipment of Western European vehicles&#13;
or recommended as provisions in order to provide a better technical safety level for the driver and the&#13;
passengers, are still missing or if provided of extremely poor quality. The consequence is both reluctance&#13;
and ignorance related to use of them. Extensive environmental problems related to emissions from&#13;
vehicles also need to be solved urgently.&#13;
Assistance to the Romanian Automobile Registry (RAR) would be used to define and purchase&#13;
laboratory equipment for testing vehicle emission levels, safety and noise. The laboratory would be used&#13;
for homologation of vehicles and equipment to required standard. The homologation would gradually&#13;
improve the technical standard of vehicles on the road and contribute to solving problems related to traffic&#13;
safety of vehicles, noise and pollution.&#13;
Technical assistance would be required for (i) assessing the needs of Romania related to harmonization&#13;
of vehicle homologation to EU and EEC guidelines and; (ii) identifying tests and homologation equipment&#13;
requirements. The twinning arrangement (ref. 2.9) would later on make available technical assistance for&#13;
institution development ie. reviewing and assessing the requirement of developing the organization of&#13;
vehicle inspection and all registries related to vehicle use.&#13;
EU-Phare would be expected to provide $ 3.83 million for financing the required procurement of&#13;
homologation equipment.&#13;

2.3    DN Traffic safety pilot project: "Bucharest-Ploiesti-Sinaia-Brasov"&#13;
The pilot project is composed of (i) studies and analyses of the present traffic safety situation on&#13;
the pilot road; (ii) implementation of non conventional low cost activities for addressing the causes for&#13;
accidents; (iii) implementation of advanced traffic surveillance and road user information technologies;&#13;
(iv) intensified well coordinated accident emergency intervention; (v) local accident board activities; (vi)&#13;
installation of a pilot road weather information system (RWIS); (vii) improved preventive winter&#13;
maintenance; (viii) traffic safety research and development (R&amp;D); (ix) intensified public traffic safety&#13;
campaigns. The pilot will demonstrate and study the impact of the numerous activities and actions on road&#13;
user behavior, measure the impact on frequency and consequence of different types of accidents and give&#13;
a sound background for traffic safety development by extending the traffic safety experience and know-&#13;
how of the participants the SICRS, the NAR, the Traffic Police, the Ministry of Health, the research&#13;
institute INCERTRANS and local public authorities. The pilot will be coordinated and monitored by the&#13;
ICRS and implemented by the entities responsible for the individual activities. Technical assistance for&#13;
planning and execution of the pilot is provided through the twinning arrangement (ref. 2.9).&#13;
The proposed loan would provide financing to NAR for procurement of required studies and&#13;
analysis, technical design, civil works, equipment/installations, materials and research/reporting. The&#13;
financing of the equipment required by the Traffic Police for this pilot to intensify accident intervention&#13;
and road user information is expected to be provided by EU-Phare and is part of the planned support&#13;
for traffic law enforcement (ref. 2.6). The costs of equipment required to improve accident emergency&#13;
intervention and start local accident board activities amounts to $100 000 and would be financed by EU-&#13;
Phare.&#13;
NAR would procure the consultants' services for studies, analysis, research and reporting from&#13;
INCERTRANS which is nominated to be responsible for all local traffic safety study- and research&#13;
activities. Supervision of the consultants' services would be a joint undertaking by SICRS and NAR.&#13;
NAR would procure and supervise all investment related technical design, civil works, road&#13;
equipment/installations and materials required for execution of the pilot. The traffic police would specify&#13;
and procure the equipment required to start local accident board activities. The SICRS would with&#13;
assistance from the Ministry of Health specify and procure the equipment needed to improve emergency&#13;
intervention.&#13;

2.6    Traffic law enforcement&#13;
The driving behavior of vehicle operators is deteriorating. Some part of this could be due to the liberation&#13;
from the previous regime and some part due to a steady increase in the number of new unexperienced&#13;
drivers (+8%/year). The main reason for driver misbehavior is however increasing ignorance&#13;
compounded by lack of efficient traffic surveillance. The project would provide equipment and&#13;
accessories to the Traffic Police for general traffic surveillance, road user information, speed control&#13;
and alcotesting.&#13;
EU-Phare financing of $4.0 million would be requested for the procurement of the equipment&#13;
consisting of (i) patrol vehicles; (ii) communication equipment: (iii) speed radars; (iv) mobile information&#13;
displays and signs and; (v) alcotesters.&#13;
The Traffic Police will specify and procure the equipment. Technical assistance for specifying&#13;
the equipment was provided using the Finnish CTF for Eastern Europe.&#13;

2.7   Education and driver training: Public school pilot&#13;
The pilot would facilitate the start of traffic safety education in 10 pilot schools. The education&#13;
would be provided to the pupils attending 3 separate levels starting from the youngest group of pupils.&#13;
One part of the pilot would be to prepare for future driver's training to be obtained voluntarily in&#13;
connection with public education. The aim of the pilot would be to develop traffic safety education for&#13;
children in order to improve children's behavior in traffic and reduce the amount of accidents involving&#13;
children and new young drivers.&#13;
The costs of the pilot would amount to $200,000 which would be financed by EU-Phare. The&#13;
pilot would provide material for traffic safety education. Technical assistance required for pilot planning,&#13;
studies, follow up and reporting would be provided through the twinning arrangement.&#13;
The SICRS would be assisted by the Ministry of Education, procure and supervise the delivery&#13;
of equipment.&#13;

2.8   Strengthening the secretariat of the ICRS (SICRS)&#13;
The capability of the SICRS to prepare the ICRS meetings, to monitor and to coordinate traffic&#13;
safety activities is hampered by the lack of experienced staff and equipment. Technical assistance to make&#13;
up for the lack of experience, know how and monitoring tools will be provided through the twinning&#13;
agreement (ref. 2.9). This component will provide the most urgent equipment required by the secretariat&#13;
to enable it to perform properly.&#13;
The SICRS would specify and procure the equipment consisting of one vehicle, 4 computers with&#13;
modems and one photocopier in accordance with EU-Phare guidelines.&#13;
EU-Phare would be requested to finance the procurement amounting to $120,000&#13;

2.9    General Technical Assistance for Traffic Safety (GTA)&#13;
The major part of the technical assistance required for the traffic safety component would be&#13;
provided as arrangements with established appropriate institutions, administrations and consultants&#13;
working in the field of traffic safety. This arrangement would make up for the lack of staff experienced&#13;
in traffic safety work in the ICRS, the secretariat for ICRS and all traffic safety entities. The objective&#13;
would be to, during the GTA period ending in December 1999, establish the tools and transfer the know&#13;
how required for the monitoring of traffic safety on ICRS level and in cooperation with ICRS and the&#13;
individual entities produce a Traffic Safety Plan 2000 - 2009 which will reduce the serious traffic&#13;
accidents by 40% when implemented completely. The GTA arrangement would provide traffic safety&#13;
expertise and related services from a group of entities covering the pluridisciplinar activities related to&#13;
improvement of traffic safety from a country with distinguished records of traffic safety achievement for:&#13;
(i) institutional development; (ii) reviewing legislation and law enforcement: (iii) monitoring traffic safety&#13;
development; (iv) improving driver's training; (v) improving traffic safety education and information; (vi)&#13;
design, planning and follow up of pilot projects; (vii) transfer of know how by arranging visits abroad;&#13;
(viii) traffic safety research and development (R&amp;D) and (ix) developing and launching the Traffic Safety&#13;
Plan 2000-2009.&#13;
The total costs of the GTA would amount to $1.7 million and would be financed by EU-Phare.&#13;
The technical assistance would consist of expert services (minimum 48 man months), training and&#13;
workshops, study tours abroad, equipment and material related to provision of the Services for a period&#13;
of 2-3 years.&#13;
The ICRS would, using standard EU-Phare procuring procedures, procure and supervise the&#13;
technical assistance services defined in the drafted Terms of Reference (ref. annex 5).&#13;

TECHNICAL SERVICES FOR -&#13;
ACCIDENT BLACK SPOT IDENTIFICATION,&#13;
- ANALYSIS AND - RECTIFICATION&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The road network and trafric&#13;
The road infrastructure in Romania, consisting of 113 km of motorways, 14 570 km of&#13;
national roads, 26 167 km of county roads and 31 166 km of department roads, is highly deteriorated&#13;
due to insufficient funding of required reconstruction and rehabilitation. Budgetary constraints have&#13;
lately continued to reduce the resources allocated to roads also leading to a growing backlog of the&#13;
rnational and local road network maintenance. Traffic performance is growing steadily due to&#13;
increased need for domestic transport of goods, growth of transit traffic and increased car ownership&#13;
(8..9% annually). A total amount of 3 million vehicles and 320 000 motorcycles and scooters are&#13;
registered. The amount of vehicles is still very low seen against a population of some 23 million and&#13;
leaves plenty of room for additional growth in the number of cars.&#13;
2.    Traffic accidents&#13;
The traffic safety situation in Romania is very poor by international standards. A total of 115&#13;
103 accidents were recorded in 1995 and 9 334 of these were rated as serious accidents causing&#13;
fatalities or injuries to the victims. The fatality rate is extremely high; 9.4 fatalities per 10 000&#13;
vehicles, 37 fatalities per 100 injured and 1.22 fatalities/10 000 inhabitants. The traffic accidents are&#13;
estimated to accumulate total costs rising close to 2% of the GDP. A substantial increase (+ 37%) in&#13;
the total amount of traffic accidents was recorded in 1995 compared to 1994 although the amount of&#13;
serious accidents was slightly reduced (- 3%). The amount of traffic accidents is likely to continue&#13;
increasing, due to growing traffic volumes, unless steps are being taken to systematically improve&#13;
the traffic environment and reduce all other main causes for traffic accidents within the framework of&#13;
a long term Traffic Safety Plan.&#13;
3.    Traffic safety development&#13;
The institutional framework and commitment for traffic safety improvement exists in Romania&#13;
today. The Minister of Transport initiated the establishing of the Interministerial Council for Road&#13;
Safety (ICRS) in the beginning of 1995. The Council, chaired by the Minister of Transport,&#13;
assembles 4-5 times per year. The meetings are prepared by a Permanent Secretariat (SICRS) headed&#13;
by Director Ion Marin. The members of the ICRS are leaders or authorized representatives of 11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 2 of 14&#13;
ministries, the Department for Local Public Administration and the Local Council of Bucharest&#13;
Municipality and the activities of the ICRS are coordinated by the Prime Minister. Representatives of&#13;
territorial units of local public administrations and related NGOs may be invited to participate at the&#13;
debates of the ICRS and of the S Special Traffic Safety Commissions (S7SC), established in 1995 in&#13;
connection with the ICRS. The SICRS with 4 staff members is getting prepared to gradually start&#13;
monitoring and coordinating all traffic safety activities. The 5 Special Commissions are composed of&#13;
ICRS members and experts of public authorities represented in the ICRS. The commissions debate&#13;
and initiate activities within specified individual traffic safety sectors to raise the awareness of the&#13;
ICRS of measures required for addressing current traffic safety problems. The ICRS elaborates and&#13;
submits priority action programs and proposals for their financing to the decision makers as well as&#13;
supervises draft legislation and formulates recommendations in the field of traffic safety. A&#13;
preliminary Priority Actions Program for 1996 - 2000 has been drafted based on proposals made by&#13;
the commissions and has been debated by the Council.&#13;
4.     Traffic safety dericiencies and problems&#13;
Defining the objectives and targets for traffic safety promotion, improving the cooperation&#13;
between the various entities involved and establishing performance indicators for monitoring traffic&#13;
safety activities requires the attention of the ICRS and a clear logical framework. Assignment of&#13;
responsibilities needs adjustment to ensure that all major aspects are being covered. A lack of staff&#13;
experienced in traffic safety work, lack of necessary equipment and lack of sufficient funds hampers&#13;
all systematic traffic safety development in spite of the present efforts of the Traffic Police, the&#13;
Romania Automobile Registry (RAR) and the SICRS to in compliance with the Priority Actions&#13;
Program.&#13;
(i)    improve the quality of accident data (new accident data collection format);&#13;
(ii)   increase the availability of accident data (statistics and publications);&#13;
(iii)   distribute regular traffic safety information using the press, radio and TV;&#13;
(iv)   improve technical vehicle standards (vehicle inspection);&#13;
(v)    improve traffic regulations (new road code); and&#13;
(vi)   increase visibility of traffic surveillance.&#13;
5.     The Romania Second Roads Project&#13;
The Government of Romania in cooperation with IBRD, EBRD and EIB is executing a&#13;
Transport Project and preparing a Second Roads Project both aimed at improving the physical&#13;
condition and the traffic environment of a significant part of the national road network. The costs&#13;
of the Romania Second Roads Project will be in the range of $ 500 million. This project is&#13;
composed of road rehabilitation, procurement of equipment for maintenance, institutional development&#13;
and a comprehensive traffic safety component of $ 24 million. The financing of the traffic safety&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

component is planned to be a joint undertaking between IBRD, EU-Phare and the main beneficiary&#13;
the Romania Road Administration (NAR). The traffic safety component is split into two separately&#13;
financed subcomponents.&#13;
a)     an investment program financed by IBRD, and&#13;
b)     a program of Institutional development and technical assistance for all the entities&#13;
involved in traffic safety planned to be financed by EU-Phare.&#13;
6.     The Trafric Safety Component&#13;
The Traffic Safety Investment Programme of $ 14 100 000 covers the engineering&#13;
components of the list of activities proposed to be performed:&#13;
(i)    elimination of traffic accident "black spots";&#13;
(ii)   installation of intelligent surveillance and information systems along the Bucharest-&#13;

SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
9.     The Consultant(s) will provide technical expertise and feasible methodology/systems  for&#13;
identifying and analyzing road traffic accident black spot locations using the accident data which is&#13;
computerized and available with NAR and the Traffic Police. This data covers the evolution of&#13;
accidents on the national road network since 1989. The data is reliable but does not fulfill all the&#13;
requirements of a western European accident data base. The accident data base is not yet connected to&#13;
a computerized road data bank. The Consultant(s) will work in cooperation with NAR, the Traffic&#13;
Police and the SICRS when reviewing and revising existing accident "long lists" and establishing the&#13;
"short list". The "short list" shall be composed of the top priority black spots to be rectified and&#13;
indicate the planned measures of rectification. The Consultant(s)' services shall include but not be&#13;
limited to:&#13;
(i)    familiarizing themselves with the general evolution and the causes for road traffic&#13;
accidents on the national road network in Romania by studying the available&#13;
accident data at NAR, the Regional Road Administrations and the Traffic Police;&#13;
(ii)    determining the nature of deficiencies of the traffic environment which are causing&#13;
the extremely high rate of severe road traffic accidents in both rural and urban&#13;
surroundings in Romania today;&#13;
(iii)   reviewing and revising the contents of existing accident black spot "long lists" and&#13;
the proposed rectification measures. These have been compiled by NAR and the&#13;
Traffic Police;&#13;
(iv)   establishing a priority "short list" of black spot locations and rectification measures to&#13;
be executed as part of the proposed IBRD financed traffic safety investment program&#13;
of $ 8.5 million. The "short list" shall indicate priority order based on assessment of&#13;
impact and cost efficiency, describe the proposed measures of rectification and&#13;
show the costs of the work to be performed. The consultant(s) shall show that the&#13;
program meets the targets of reducing the total amount of fatalities in the targeted&#13;
black spot locations by &gt; 40 and the amount of injuries by &gt; 120;&#13;
(v)    compiling a $2 million black spot rectification program feasible for execution in 1997&#13;
and assisting in supervision of the technical design required for executing the&#13;
program. Special attention shall be given choice and design of non conventional&#13;
rectification measures to be included in a R&amp;D program. The execution of this R&amp;D&#13;
program will be a vital part of traffic safety development to be performed as part of&#13;
pilot 1 Bucharest-Ploiesti-Sinaia-Brasov road;&#13;
(vi)   specifying the R&amp;D related to above $2 million black spot rectification program;&#13;

ROMANIA&#13;
SECOND ROADS PROJECT&#13;
GENERAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES FOR TRAFFIC SAFETY&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The road network and traffic&#13;
The road infrastructure in Romania, consisting of 113 km of motorways, 14 570 km of national&#13;
roads, 26 167 km of county roads and 31 166 km of department roads, is highly deteriorated due to&#13;
insufficient funding of required reconstruction and rehabilitation. Budgetary constraints have lately&#13;
continued to reduce the resources allocated to roads leading to a growing backlog of the national and&#13;
local road network maintenance. Traffic performance is growing steadily due to increased need for&#13;
domestic transport of goods, growth of transit traffic and increased car ownership (8..9% annually).&#13;
A total amount of 3 million vehicles and 320 000 motorcycles and scooters are registered. This is still&#13;
very low seen against a population of some 23 million and leaves plenty of room for additional&#13;
growth.&#13;
2.    Traffic accidents&#13;
The traffic safety situation in Romania is very poor by international standards. A total of&#13;
169 383 accidents were recorded in 1996 and 8 931 of these were rated as serious accidents causing&#13;
fatalities or serious injuries and 11 601 causing light injuries to the victims. The fatality rate is&#13;
extremely high; 9.4 fatalities per 10 000 vehicles, 37 fatalities per 100 injured and 1.22 fatalities/10&#13;
000 inhabitants. The traffic accidents are estimated to accumulate total annual costs rising close to 2%&#13;
of the GDP. A substantial increase (+ 37%) in the total amount of traffic accidents was recorded in&#13;
1995 compared to 1994 although the amount of serious accidents was slightly reduced (- 3%). The&#13;
amount of traffic accidents is likely to continue increasing, due to growing traffic volumes, unless&#13;
steps are being taken to systematically improve the traffic environment and reduce all other main&#13;
causes for traffic accidents within the framework of a long term Traffic Safety Plan.&#13;
3.    Traffic safety development&#13;
The institutional framework and commitment for traffic safety improvement exists in Romania&#13;
today. The Minister of Transport initiated the establishing of the Interministerial Council for Road&#13;
Safety (ICRS) in the beginning of 1995. The council, chaired by the Minister of Transport,&#13;
assembles 4-5 times per year. The meetings are prepared by a Permanent Secretariat (SICRS). The&#13;
members of the ICRS are leaders or authorized representatives of 11 ministries, the Department for&#13;
Local Public Administration and the Local Council of Bucharest Municipality and the activities of the&#13;
ICRS are coordinated by the Prime Minister. Representatives of territorial units of local public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 9 of 14&#13;
administrations and related NGOs may be invited to participate at the debates of the ICRS and of the&#13;
S Special Traffic Safety Commissions (STSC), established in 1995 in connection with the ICRS. The&#13;
SICRS with 4 staff members is getting prepared to gradually start monitoring and coordinating all&#13;
traffic safety activities. The 5 Special Commissions are composed of ICRS members and experts of&#13;
public authorities represented in the ICRS. The commissions debate and initiate activities within&#13;
specified individual traffic safety sectors to raise the awareness of the ICRS of measures required for&#13;
addressing current traffic safety problems. The ICRS elaborates and submits priority action programs&#13;
and proposals for their financing to the decision makers as well as supervises draft legislation and&#13;
formulates recommendations in the field of traffic safety. A preliminary Priority Actions Program for&#13;
1996-2000 has been drafted based on proposals made by the commissions and debated by the council.&#13;
4.     Traffic safety deficiencies and problems&#13;
Defining the objectives and targets for traffic safety promotion, improving the cooperation between&#13;
the various entities involved and establishing performance indicators for monitoring traffic safety&#13;
activities requires the attention of the ICRS and a clear logical framework. Assignment of&#13;
responsibilities needs adjustment to ensure that all major aspects are being covered. A lack of staff&#13;
experienced in traffic safety work, lack of necessary equipment and lack of sufficient funds hampers&#13;
all systematic traffic safety development despite the present efforts of the Traffic Police, the Romania&#13;
Automobile Registry (RAR) and the SICRS to in compliance with the Priority Actions Program.&#13;
(i)     improve the quality of accident data (new accident data collection format);&#13;
(ii)    increase the availability of accident data (statistics and publications);&#13;
(iii)    distribute regular traffic safety information using the press, radio and TV;&#13;
(iv)    improve technical vehicle standards (vehicle inspection);&#13;
(v)     improve traffic regulations (new road code); and&#13;
(vi)    increase visibility of traffic surveillance.&#13;
5.     The Romania Second Roads Project&#13;
The government of Romania in cooperation with IBRD, EBRD and EIB is executing a&#13;
Transport Project and preparing a Second Roads Project both aimed at improving the physical&#13;
condition and the traffic environment of a significant part of the national road network. The costs&#13;
of the Romania Second Roads Project will be in the range of $ 500 million. This project is&#13;
composed of road rehabilitation, procurement of equipment for maintenance, institutional development&#13;
and a comprehensive traffic safety component of $ 24 million. The financing of the traffic safety&#13;
component is planned to be a joint undertaking between IBRD, EU-Phare and the main beneficiary&#13;
the Romania Road Administration (NAR). The traffic safety component is split into two separately&#13;
financed subcomponents:&#13;

Economic Analysis&#13;
of Road Sections to be Rehabilitated&#13;
1. Two consultant teams have prepared detailed feasibility studies of over 2,500 km of&#13;
national roads to establish priorities for this project. Consultants' reports are in the project&#13;
file. They give very detailed analysis and all the parameters used in the Bank's Highway&#13;
Design Model (HDM-III).&#13;
2. Below are a few summary tables and a sample detailed cost-benefit analysis for 2 sections&#13;
retained for Bank financing.&#13;
Table 1 gives the inputs used by HDM to calculate vehicle operating costs.&#13;
Table 2 gives the base year (1995) traffic levels, cost estimates and IRR for the sections to&#13;
be financed by the Bank and the sensitivity of the IRR in 3 scenarios:&#13;
Sensitivity test 1. Increase of the roads rehabilitation costs by 20%. This is applied&#13;
to the economic costs of rehabilitation, occurring in the first three years of the&#13;
analysis (1997, 1998, 1999). All other parameters are left unchanged.&#13;
Sensitivity test 2. Increase of the road maintenance costs by 20%. This is applied to&#13;
the annual and recurrent periodic costs, at their economic values. All other&#13;
parameters are left unchanged.&#13;
Sensitivity test 3. Decrease of the annual savings by 20%. This decrease is applied&#13;
to the annual amount of savings in the years of operation of the Project (2000 through&#13;
2019), in economic terms. This sensitivity test, applied directly to the savings, takes&#13;
into account two factors and the combined effects of their possible decreases (e.g. the&#13;
traffic volumes and the amount of the specific savings of the vehicles).&#13;
It can be verified that the reduction of the recurrent costs (road maintenance) does not&#13;
affect the IRR while some influence of IRR is observed for the increase of the&#13;
construction costs and the reduction of the benefits (annual savings). Generally, the&#13;
obtained results can be considered stable, as the elasticity factor is less than 1.&#13;
Table 3 gives detailed cost-benefit analysis for 2 typical road sections. All other C-B&#13;
calculations are in the consultants' report in the project file.&#13;

            Romania - Second Roads Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Second Roads
            Project are to: (1) improve traffic safety and vehicle fleet
            fitness; (2) continue helping Romania to meet changing
            demand for land transport infrastructure; (3) improve the
            management and performance of the road administration (NAR);
            (4) assist the Romanian civil works construction industry in
            its transition to a market economy; (5) promote lead
            reduction in petrol; and (6) assist Romania to harmonize the
            standards of its road network, of its vehicles and their
            safety, and of the institutional practices of NAR with those
            of the European Union. The project consists of five
            components: (a) road and bridge rehabilitation, to include
            overlaying, construction and reconstruction, widening, and
            geometric improvements; (b) a traffic safety program
            involving education, engineering, and enforcement; (c)
            institution building involving NAR computerization, the
            introduction of bridge and pavement management systems,
            transport planning, privatization of maintenance and
            installation; (d) assistance to the civil works and
            construction industry, training programs and equipment
            financing; and (e) an action plan to reduce lead in petrol.
