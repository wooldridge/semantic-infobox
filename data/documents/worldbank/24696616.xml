ANNEX I&#13;
Governance Structure and Description of Activities and Expenditures&#13;
under the Multi-Donor Nordic Trust Fund&#13;
1.    Purpose&#13;
1.1   The multi-year and multi-donor Nordic Trust Fund (TF) will help the Bank&#13;
develop an informed view on how human rights relate to its analytical activities and&#13;
operations by identifying and :apping into the Bank's comparative advantages and ways&#13;
to systematize and improve existing involvement in human rights areas in the overall&#13;
context of the Bank's core mission of promoting economic growth and poverty&#13;
reduction.' It is primarily a Bank-internal 'learning by doing' process based on pilot&#13;
projects, but may involve limii:ed activities in countries provided that there is an express&#13;
interest from governments.&#13;
1.2   The TF will support work to explore ways in which human rights approaches to&#13;
poverty reduction can make World Bank Group analysis and operations more effective in&#13;
accordance with the priorities of partner countries; and to identify innovative approaches&#13;
to e.g. access to education, access to justice, rule of law and greater equity and equality in&#13;
application of the law and legal rights, particularly those that empower vulnerable groups.&#13;
1.3   The TF activities fall squarely within and will support current efforts to align&#13;
Bank activities with its new Pr iority Themes, providing an added lens to the Themes.&#13;
1.4   The TF will be task managed from within OPCCS, and lessons learned will be&#13;
reported to CODE. The lesson learned could, in turn, provide factual information on how&#13;
human rights relate to priority ssues of the Bank.&#13;
2.     Indicative activities&#13;
2.1    The TF's preliminary work program would envisage supporting the following&#13;
types of activities:&#13;
(i)   Applied Research: core focus would be the interface of economics and&#13;
human righi s.&#13;
See IBRD Articles of Agreement, ,rt. IV, Section 10 ("The Bank and its officers shall not interfere in the&#13;
political affairs of any member; nor shall they be influenced in their decisions by the political&#13;
character of the member or members concerned. Only economic considerations shall be relevant to&#13;
their decisions, and these considerations shall be weighed impartially in order to achieve the purposes&#13;
stated in Article I.").&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-5-&#13;
(ii)  Capacity Bvilding ofBank Staff- would seek first to gauge Bank staff's&#13;
familiarity and training needs on human rights in order to design tools&#13;
and capacit3 building activities.&#13;
(iii)  Operations: would provide a concrete means for Bank staff, in the&#13;
networks and country offices, to identify how human rights could help&#13;
improve eN isting activities, in-line with government development&#13;
priorities. Limited recipient executed activities in the form of pilot&#13;
projects buiding on the outcomes of the applied research undertaken&#13;
under this TF, or in response to an explicit country request, could be&#13;
carried out.&#13;
(iv)  Partnershipv: would be cross-cutting to other activities, with&#13;
internationa. partners, and designed to identify and promote means for&#13;
better coordination of activities at the field-level.&#13;
2.2   These activities may be revised after a minimum of 2 years of the TF's operation&#13;
based on initial results of the TF activities and as specified in the TF work plan as&#13;
developed in consultation with the TF donors.&#13;
3.    Governance Structure&#13;

(OPCCS) in the Operations Poicy and Country Services (OPCS) Vice Presidency.&#13;
3.2   The day-to-day manag,ment of the Trust Fund (TF) will be undertaken by the TF&#13;
Secretariat within OPCCS under supervision of the TF coordinator. The Secretariat will&#13;
administer, manage and overnee the TF activities, provide support to the TF Steering&#13;
Committee, prepare annual monitoring reports, and organize annual discussions with TF&#13;
donors. A Steering Committt,e, comprising senior representatives from relevant Vice&#13;
Presidential Units across the 3ank, will be responsible for developing the TF's annual&#13;
work plan, overseeing the disr:ribution of funds, and monitoring the TFs outcomes and&#13;
impact. The OPCS Vice President will, appoint a TF Coordinator who will be a member&#13;
of the Steering Committee ard manage the Secretariat. This TF Coordinator will take&#13;
over from the interim Task Team Leader for the TF, prior to operational disbursements.&#13;
3.3   Through an annual consultation process, TF donors will be able to provide to the&#13;
Steering Committee input inlo and feedback on the proposed annual work plan and&#13;
budget. An annual Progress Report, evaluating the outcomes of activities financed, will&#13;
be submitted to the TF donors.&#13;
3.4   Following the establishment of the TF, the Secretariat will develop and propose a&#13;
resource allocation process which will be vetted and endorsed by the Steering Committee.&#13;
