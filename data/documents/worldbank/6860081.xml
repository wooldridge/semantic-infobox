how  the  MDGs    Are unique coMpAreD to previous DevelopMent GoAls&#13;
&#13;
When the U.N. Mllennum Development Goals (MDGs) were first an-&#13;
&#13;
nounced, many development professonals felt that the MDGs were smply an-&#13;
&#13;
other set of promses rfe wth rhetorc and set to form another set of broken&#13;
&#13;
promses to the poor. Upon further reflecton, several key factors dstngush&#13;
&#13;
the MDGs from prevous "commtments" to end poverty, and whch are vtal&#13;
&#13;
to the success of the ntatve:&#13;
&#13;
  · Non-ndustralzed countres are nvolved n all aspects of realzng the&#13;
&#13;
     goals, ncludng strategc plannng, mplementaton, and reportng.&#13;
&#13;
  · The goals are measurable, wth reportable performance evaluaton tar-&#13;
&#13;
     gets, dates and metrcs dentfied and outlned for each MDG.&#13;
&#13;
  · Over 100 partcpatng non-ndustralzed countres are nvolved n mon-&#13;
&#13;
     torng and reportng on those performance metrcs.&#13;
&#13;
  · There s strong busness nterest and nvolvement.&#13;

how   countries Are enGAGeD with the privAte sector&#13;
&#13;
Many countres are focusng on how the prvate sector can become nvolved n&#13;
achevng MDGs at the country level. For example, the Phlppne Busness for&#13;
Socal Progress (PBSP) produced a report enttled "Respondng to the Mllen-&#13;
num Development Challenge: A Roadmap for Phlppne Busness," funded&#13;
by the UN n collaboraton wth the Phlppne Government.&#13;
   The publcaton s based on several dscussons wth key busness leaders n&#13;
the Phlppnes who have created a strategy to engage busness. Most are mem-&#13;
bers and partners of PBSP (www.pbsp.org.ph), and most have an exstng CSR&#13;
program n ther company.&#13;
   As a result, busnesses advsed PBSP to cluster the eght goals nto four: 1)&#13;
Busness and Poverty, 2) Busness and Educaton, 3) Busness and Health, 4)&#13;
Busness and the Envronment.&#13;
   They then concluded that to be able to help acheve the MDGs n the&#13;
country, CSR programs should be addressed on three levels: core busness, so-&#13;
cal nvestment, and polcy. A copy of the publcaton s avalable by contact-&#13;

The Private Sector's Role in the MDG Task Force on Hunger&#13;
Pedro Sanchez, char of the Hunger Task Force, outlned how the prvate sec-&#13;
tor s takng an actve role n shapng the recommendatons and actvtes of&#13;
the Hunger Task Force. Thrty ndvduals serve on the Task Force of whch&#13;
four are from the prvate sector ncludng Rchard Beers, formerly of Tme&#13;
Warner; Robert Horst, VP of Products and Technology, Monsanto Company;&#13;
Hans Eenhoorn, Senor Vce Presdent of Foods, Unlever; and Lars Wer-&#13;
sholm, retred Senor Vce Presdent, Yara Internatonal.&#13;
    Mr. Sanchez emphaszed that the Hunger Task Force has moved from&#13;
emphaszng poltcal commtments to acton, and that publc awareness&#13;
campagns about how ndvduals can contrbute to reducng hunger n the&#13;
world--what Sanchez calls the "slent tsunam" n Afrca--were key to&#13;
achevng Mllennum Development Goal # 1: Eradcate Extreme Poverty and&#13;
Hunger.&#13;
    The Task Force has establshed a number of partnershps wth the pr-&#13;
vate sector and also wth NGOs to address ssues such as poor sol qualty,&#13;
nutrton deficency, and water deficency. For example, the "No Chld Left&#13;
Hungry" program has been created n partnershp wth the World Food Pro-&#13;
gram n partnershp wth several firms n the food sector. The Task Force also&#13;
establshed a partnershp wth Monsanto to allow draught-resstant corn to be&#13;
gven free to Afrca.&#13;
    Sanchez says that the goal of many of these partnershps wth the prvate&#13;
sector s to brng "free IPR" (ntellectual property rghts) to the developng&#13;
world by havng patent rght waved by large corporatons, workng wth the&#13;
prvate sector to create specfic technologes, and brdgng the gulf between&#13;
agrcultural and nutrton experts.&#13;
    The Task Force s also workng at the local level to work n partnershp&#13;
wth local farmers. In collaboraton wth Unlever and the New Partnershp&#13;
for Afrca's Development (NEPAD), the Task Force has establshed the Home&#13;
Grown School Feedng program to encourage farmers to donate 10% of ther&#13;
crop producton to local schools.&#13;
    And n August 2005, Motorola Networks agreed to nstall equpment and&#13;
tran local staff on how to repar and use the equpment n UN Mllennum&#13;
Vllages n Kenya and Ethopa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   The Private Sector's Role in the MDG Task Force on Education and Gender&#13;
   Equality&#13;
   The Mllennum Project Task Force on Educaton and Gender Equalty recog-&#13;
   nzed the mportance of nvolvement of the prvate sector n the development&#13;
   of effectve, responsve prmary and secondary educaton systems n low- and&#13;
   mddle-ncome countres. Varous roles were dscussed, ncludng: (a) the pr-&#13;
   vate sector as the prmary employer of the products of the educaton system,&#13;
   and therefore crucal stakeholders n questons of educaton system qualty;&#13;
   (b) the prvate sector as financer of mprovements n educaton, partcularly&#13;
   through specal programs organzed by large natonal employers and /or&#13;
   through the corporate socal responsblty programs of multnatonal firms;&#13;
   and (c) the prvate sector as provder of educaton- and schoolng-related&#13;
   servces. The Task Force noted that the central responsblty for the educaton&#13;
   system les wth the government and households, but that the prvate sector&#13;
   can be a valuable partner, partcularly n provdng the resources for demon-&#13;
   straton projects that ntroduce nnovatons n the provson of schoolng. Even&#13;
    more mportantly, the prvate sector can effectvely advocate for mprovements&#13;
    n the educaton system, whch s central to a country's long-term economc&#13;
   development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The Private Sector's Role in the MDG Task Force on Water and Sanitation&#13;
   Accordng to the Task Force on Water and Santaton, t recognzes that&#13;
   provdng sustanable access to water and santaton servces where they are&#13;
   needed most--the world's poorest communtes--requres financal nvestment&#13;
   from a wde varety of partners, ncludng the prvate sector. It also requres&#13;
   capacty buldng at dfferent levels of human settlements, ncludng rural com-&#13;
   muntes, small and large towns, and n the mega ctes. Prvate sector partc-&#13;
   paton both n financal nvestment and n capacty buldng s ndeed crtcal&#13;
   to meetng Target 10.&#13;
       The Task Force also recognzes that there are certan condtons and&#13;
   reforms needed to create the rght envronment where prvatzaton works and&#13;
   also benefits and serves those whose stuatons are most dre. Ths enablng&#13;
   envronment s defined n the final report, Health, Dignity and Develop-&#13;
    ment: What Will it Take?, outlnng specfic recommendatons for all actors&#13;
   nvolved. Aganst the backdrop of an ongong and often heated debate about&#13;
   the approprate roles for the prvate sector n water and santaton, the Task&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Force beleves that an ndependent, balanced, multstakeholder assessment of&#13;
the mpacts of publc and prvate sector partcpaton would be useful. Such a&#13;
revew would glean lessons from past experences and enhance decson-mak-&#13;
ng on servce delvery optons.&#13;
    The Task Force supports ntatves n the prvate sector amed at achev-&#13;
ng the water and santaton MDGs. One such ntatve has been developed&#13;
by Thames Water, and s based on the dea of an nternatonal partnershp&#13;
between responsble prvate sector organzatons and nternatonal NGOs.&#13;
Addtonal donor ad garnered by the partnershp would be used to carry out&#13;
n-country projects workng wth local nsttutons and organzatons to buld&#13;
capacty and delver water and santaton servces n rural and sem-rural&#13;
areas. So far WaterAd and CARE are on board. The Task Force has also nt-&#13;
ated dscussons wth plans for further collaboraton wth the World Economc&#13;
Forum, whose water ntatve also sees the need for strengthenng multstake-&#13;
holder partnershps, but wth a focus on sustanable water resources manage-&#13;
ment. Another promsng area s the possble applcaton of prvate sector&#13;
experence n franchsng to the development and support of local servce&#13;
provders n small towns and rural areas for the sustanable delvery of relable&#13;
servces at local levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
recoMMenDAtions    froM the privAte sector&#13;
&#13;
The Mllennum Development Goals offer a great opportunty to engage the&#13;
prvate sector n specfic goals that must be acheved n ten years. There are&#13;
lterally thousands of firms throughout the world that could be motvated to&#13;
publcly commt to specfic actons that they wll contrbute to the achevement&#13;
of the MDGs. We have reached a pont where t s tme to partner wth bus-&#13;
nesses large and small. In response, n the sprng and summer of 2005, several&#13;
one-on-one dscussons were held wth hgh-level executves from the prvate&#13;
sector, and from July 11 through July 15, 2005, a busness-only electronc&#13;
dscusson wth leaders from a range of sectors and a varety of contnents was&#13;
hosted by the World Bank Insttute, supported by InWEnt and the Prnce of&#13;
Wales Internatonal Busness Leaders Forum.&#13;
    These prvate and group dscussons were ntended to allow a small group&#13;
of senor executves from the busness sector the opportunty to canddly share&#13;
ther vews and experences wth each other on how they felt the prvate sector&#13;
could become more nvolved n the MDGs. Ther comments helped deter-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     mne the recommendatons found below on how the prvate sector can more&#13;
     actvely contrbute to achevement of the MDGs. Followng s a summary of&#13;
     ther recommendatons and opnons from these dscussons:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Educate the private sector&#13;
     Often the prvate sector s gven a generc challenge or "encouraged" to&#13;
     become a partner n development and yet many medum- and small-szed&#13;
     busnesses are not brought nto the dscusson. To have them more engaged,&#13;
     there s need to better educate more from the prvate sector to understand the&#13;
     challenges facng our world. For example, the Karolnska Insttute has created&#13;
     an excellent overvew of the global challenges the world has faced for the past&#13;
     several decades, the progress acheved, and the challenges that reman. Many&#13;
     n the prvate sector who are exposed to ths overvew are moved to acton&#13;
     because many of them smply were not aware of the vast challenges to the&#13;
     envronment, health, nfant mortalty, and the laundry lst of development s-&#13;
     sues whch development professonals are deeply aware of. Makng busnesses&#13;
     aware of the global development challenges we face s crtcally mportant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Go beyond networking, lessons learned, and determining follow-up actions&#13;
     Often meetngs wth the prvate sector nvolve networkng to buld relaton-&#13;
     shps; dentfyng best practces and lessons learned; and creatng an "acton&#13;
     agenda" or ways of movng forward. Years have been spent dentfyng and&#13;
     analyzng nnovatve UN partnershp approaches for development, net-&#13;
     workng, sharng lessons learned, and provdng nput on the way forward.&#13;
     Unfortunately, when partcpants return to ther offices, there s a good feelng&#13;
     of goodwll, camaradere, and even a shared vson about what should be done&#13;
     but there needs to be more tme spent ensurng acton s then taken toward a&#13;
     common goal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Allow them to specifically respond&#13;
     After these meetngs, there s need to gve the prvate sector an opportunty to&#13;
     specfically say how they wll contrbute to x challenge or x MDG. Presentng&#13;
     a menu of exstng programs to whch organzatons would lke the prvate&#13;
     sector to donate or partcpate s less effectve than askng them how they plan&#13;
     to become nvolved or what they would lke to do to help allevate poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   It was also suggested that each year Chambers of Commerce throughout&#13;
the world should focus on a specfic MDG around whch they rally busnesses&#13;
support n ther local communty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Focus on sectors, not "the private sector" writ large&#13;
Hewlett-Packard's former Senor Vce Presdent Debra Dunn's wrote that, "I&#13;
defintely thnk there are opportuntes to more effectvely engage wth the&#13;
prvate sector around the MDGs, but I would advocate targeted engagement.&#13;
By that, I mean connecting with specific industry groups and discussing how&#13;
they can be involved in a way that is specifically relevant to their business. For&#13;
example, the communcatons/meda ndustry could find ways to broadly ds-&#13;
semnate nformaton about the MDGs and the progress n achevng them."&#13;
   Mr. Bulloch from Accenture Development Partnershps stated, "I lked&#13;
the dea that some partcpants rased n terms of focusng on a specfic sector.&#13;
What s the analogous development challenge that [a sector's] core compe-&#13;
tences can addresses and how can you algn a busness benefit wth a socal or&#13;
economc development benefit? What can the bg banks brng to mcrofinance?&#13;
How can utlty companes coalesce to address the challenges surroundng ac-&#13;
cess to clean drnkng water n the South? How can telecommuncatons firms&#13;
brng ICT or wreless technology to bottom of the pyramd markets? How can&#13;
food companes and other retalers apply far trade practces n ther extended&#13;
supply chans?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Appoint champions from the private sector to lead a particular goal&#13;
It was suggested that sector-specfic strateges be created and led by represen-&#13;
tatves from the prvate sector. The strateges would focus on how specfic&#13;
ndustres or sectors wll contrbute to MDG achevement n the followng key&#13;
areas:&#13;
   · Communcaton&#13;
   · Energy&#13;
   · Entertanment&#13;
   · Envronment&#13;
   · Fnancal&#13;
   · Food&#13;
   · Manufacturng&#13;
   · Meda&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                     11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       · Medcal Technology&#13;
       · Pharmaceutcals&#13;
       · Technology&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Appoint ambassadors to lead a specific goal led by the private sector&#13;
     Most ambassadors are well-connected to the busness sector and therefore&#13;
     havng them apponted to a specfic ndustry to acheve the Goals would allow&#13;
     them to utlze ther deep connectons to the busness and dplomatc commu-&#13;
     nty. It was suggested that Ambassadors of all natons do more for develop-&#13;
     ment n the South.&#13;
         Embark on an awareness rasng campagn--for example n the Unted&#13;
     States through the Small Busness Development Centers that reach 25 mllon&#13;
     small busnesses.&#13;
         There s a need to buld more busness awareness of the MDGs, such as&#13;
     by havng respected leaders speak at ndustry-specfic annual meetngs, con-&#13;
     nectng wth natonal ndustry assocatons, creatng ndustry-specfic onlne&#13;
     dscusson groups where development organzatons have an ongong dalogue&#13;
     wth the prvate sector by ndustry. Engagng wth natonal Small Busness&#13;
     Development Centers that exst throughout the world to create a natonal&#13;
     "What are you dong for the MDGs?" could potentally reach 25 mllon small&#13;
     busnesses, and there are many more potental ways of nvolvng more from&#13;
     the prvate sector by ndustry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Put the MDG logo on websites of businesses to encourage awareness,&#13;
     employee participation and donations&#13;
     Hundreds of mllons of people vst corporate webstes every day, thus put-&#13;
     tng the MDG logo onto these webstes would create much greater awareness&#13;
     of the MDGs. Google receves well over 200 mllon hts per day to ther&#13;
     web ste. In 2004, CNN receved 33 mllon hts per day on a slow news day&#13;
     and 2. bllon on a breakng news day. Yahoo--the 3th most recognzed&#13;
     name n the world--receved 237 mllon unque vstors to ther portal ste&#13;
     each month, and Hotmal drew 145 mllon people each month n 2004. The&#13;
     ablty for the prvate sector to rase awareness on the Mllennum Develop-&#13;
     ment Goals and communcate wth mllons around the globe n an nstant s&#13;
     unprecedented n the hstory of manknd.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    Consder f representatves of these global stes and several other natonal&#13;
webstes decde that they want to use ther ablty to drectly communcate&#13;
wth mllons of ndvduals, consumers, and ctzens on a partcular busness,&#13;
socal or poltcal ssue. These stes have the ablty to change the thoughts and&#13;
actons of mllons of people around the globe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Push companies to do more&#13;
A retal sector commentator was candd that busness s "not dong enough"&#13;
for development and noted that the major hurdles lmtng corporate nvolve-&#13;
ment n development work are cost, lmted resources, percepton of lmted&#13;
benefit, and low prorty n relaton to commercal projects.&#13;
    An nterestng quote:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      "Many employees wthn our organzaton would lke to do a great&#13;
      deal more to provde a definable measurable contrbuton towards the&#13;
      MDGs. However, we are a busness prmarly. We must keep one eye on&#13;
      the horzon and mantan a balance wth commercalty/profitablty."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The commentator was pleased wth the Unted Natons Global Compact,&#13;
statng that UNGC has acted as a catalyst for actons contrbutng to develop-&#13;
ment wthn companes:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      "Communcatons from the UNGC come to me and to our CEO, and&#13;
      often from the office of the UN Secretary General. I'm not sure about&#13;
      your companes, but here that means acton (!) and letters filter down to&#13;
      my level covered n red pen nstructons or questons from my CEO. "&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Importantly, he noted that the major hurdles lmtng corporate nvolve-&#13;
ment n development work are the cost, lmted resources, percepton of&#13;
lmted benefit, and low prorty n relaton to commercal projects.&#13;
    Establsh a publc-prvate "go to" place that provdes advce to representa-&#13;
tves of the prvate sector and UN organzatons on how to make the partner-&#13;
shp work over the long-term&#13;
    Several from the prvate sector made recommendatons on how to create&#13;
better partnershps between organzatons and the prvate sector. Throughout&#13;
our dscussons wth the prvate sector, t was sad often that t would be help-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     ful for those seekng to buld partnershps to rely on representatves from the&#13;
     prvate and publc sectors to dentfy the rght players; help negotate the terms&#13;
     of the agreement; provde sample Memoranda of Understandng (MOUs),&#13;
     project plannng and management tools; hold regular status meetngs between&#13;
     partners; serve as a neutral arbter for problem resoluton when the partner-&#13;
     shp founders; and help to refine the partnershp as t develops over the course&#13;
     of the ntatve as needed. It has been suggested that a foundaton or unver-&#13;
     sty undertake ths role, allowng the foundaton to serve as a neutral arbter&#13;
     between the non-profit and prvate sectors seekng to collaborate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Spend more time thinking strategically about exactly how a specific firm can&#13;
     become involved&#13;
     Busnesses often lamented that nonprofit and other organzatons seek only&#13;
     financal donatons from them but they would respond more postvely when&#13;
     they are asked how to solve a specfic problem. Thus, t s mportant to be&#13;
     more creatve about the contrbutons the prvate sector can make rather than&#13;
     only seekng financal contrbutons.&#13;
         Gb Bulloch, Drector of Accenture Development Partnershps, opned&#13;
     that, "I strongly beleve companes must go beyond beng just the cheque book&#13;
     and seek to be broader partners brngng ther other core assets such as brand,&#13;
     scale and certanly people (who I beleve are a sgnficant untapped resource&#13;
     for development mpact wthn every organzaton). They need to determne&#13;
     whch core competences they can brng to the table and n what ways."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Understand the private sector partner and their foundations&#13;
     It was suggested that more tme should be spent dentfyng the firm's devel-&#13;
     opment prortes, motvatons for jonng the partnershp, and financal and&#13;
     staffing constrants. What s the culture of the targeted firm? What are the&#13;
     ways that they have partnered wth the nonprofit sector n the past? Why&#13;
     do they seek to only engage n ther communty or only n the Unted States?&#13;
     There are often consderable concerns for the prvate sector to focus on ssues&#13;
     outsde of ther communty or country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Improve negotiation skills&#13;
     If the prvate sector s lukewarm to partnerng, organzatons need to be skll-&#13;
     ful n determnng what s expected of companes and be ready and able to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
answer ther questons and address ther concerns. More tme should be spent&#13;
workng wth prospectve prvate sector partners to create a shared vson and&#13;
mutual agreement about the results all sdes seek and the contrbutons that&#13;
wll be made.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Communicate more during the consensus-building process and identify ways&#13;
to ensure a successful partnership&#13;
Several from the prvate sector felt that organzatons often gve up too soon&#13;
on creatng a partnershp. By creatng an open, ongong, and long-term da-&#13;
logue durng the consensus and agreement buldng process, the agenda can&#13;
be adjusted to buld a shared vson and ncrease commtment to the ntatve.&#13;
Many partnershps falter because both sdes are unable to resolve a rather&#13;
mnor stckng pont, whch then leads the whole process to founder.&#13;
   John Banda, General Manager from JJ Enterprse n Malaw offered hs&#13;
keys to success of any partnershp:&#13;
   · Transparency and accountablty to both partes&#13;
   · Achevng the ntended goal of the partnershp&#13;
   · Accept each others deas f they are constructve&#13;
   · Be flexble to change f there are unforeseen crcumstances&#13;
   · Communcate mmedately all urgent matters&#13;
   Dr. Andreas Bluethner works for the dvson of European Governmental&#13;
Affars for BASF, a global chemcal company, responsble for Internatonal&#13;
relatons and UN-busness partnershps. He suggested that partnershps work&#13;
best when there s:&#13;
  · Transparency&#13;
  · Trust&#13;
  · Management of expectatons&#13;
  · Partnershp buldng and management sklls&#13;
  · Avalable resources&#13;
  · A "busness case" nstead of pure phlanthropy&#13;
  · Sound nternal and external communcaton&#13;
  · Flexblty and allance competence, but necessary level of formalzaton&#13;
  · Ablty to "translate" between dfferent organzatonal cultures&#13;
  · Agreement on a common goal&#13;
  · Complementary resources, competences and capactes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                              15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Edward E. Mller s Presdent and General Manager of GTB n Santa Cruz,&#13;
    Bolva. Mr. Mller wrote that for these partnershps to work, a top-down&#13;
    commtment from the hghest levels of management has to be establshed wth&#13;
    weekly reportng nsde the organzaton requred from the manager responsble&#13;
    for the project as well transparency and clarty on what can and cannot be done.&#13;
        Dr. Ethel M. Cormer of the Procter &amp; Gamble Nutrton Scence Insttute&#13;
    lsted her keys to successful partnershp:&#13;
      · Takng tme to define the objectves, goals, and measures&#13;
      · Takng tme to define the structure (e.g., decson makng, communca-&#13;
         ton, etc.), roles and responsbltes&#13;
      · Takng tme to develop more than surface relatonshps wth partners so&#13;
         that trust and openness s possble&#13;
      · Understandng the culture of the partnerng organzatons and supportng&#13;
         the partner based on ths understandng&#13;
      · Over communcatng&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Ways to ensure private sector partnerships are effective&#13;
    What makes some partnershps more effectve than others? What are the keys&#13;
    to success of partnershps? The followng are a few key elements that were&#13;
    suggested for consderaton when developng any partnershp nvolvng the&#13;
    prvate sector and non-profit or non-governmental organzatons:&#13;
      · Thnk strategcally--Spend tme understandng the roles of the organza-&#13;
         tons. Be creatve about the key contrbutons the prvate sector can make&#13;
         as well as the contrbutons development organzatons can make.&#13;
      · Sell t--How can the proposed partnershp be made attractve for bus-&#13;
         ness and development to want to engage and contrbute? A sold draft of&#13;
         a memorandum of understandng s mportant to begn any dscusson&#13;
         ncludng clear communcaton about what the stakeholder seeks from&#13;
         the prvate sector. Be clear about what s to be acheved and the benefits&#13;
         the partnershp wll brng.&#13;
      · Be flexble--If ether party s lukewarm to the ntatve that s beng&#13;
         proposed, be drect n askng what they need n order to jon the nta-&#13;
         tve. Work wth your prospectve partners to create a shared vson and&#13;
         agreement about the results all sdes seek.&#13;
      · Be clear about roles and tmelnes--The obvous mportance of den-&#13;
         tfyng who wll do what and when t wll be accomplshed cannot be&#13;
         overstated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  · Seek ther deas--If the prvate sector approaches a development orga-&#13;
     nzaton about ther "pet project" or f the development organzaton&#13;
     approaches the prvate sector about a specfic ntatve, often the organ-&#13;
     zaton beng approached feels sdelned. It could contrbute more to the&#13;
     ntatve, but s reluctant as ts opnons and creatve approaches were&#13;
     not sought. Invtng the prvate sector to donate fundng to an exstng&#13;
     ntatve s tradtonal "phlanthropy", not a partnershp. Askng a global&#13;
     organzaton to support a prvate sector development ntatve s often&#13;
     perceved as smply usng the good name of the organzaton to help the&#13;
     prvate sector acheve ts goals, and ths s also not a partnershp. Thus, t&#13;
     s mperatve to nvolve all partners n shapng the ntatve.&#13;
  · Understand--Seek to understand partners' concerns, motvatons for jon-&#13;
     ng the partnershp, the constrants they face, culture of the prvate sector,&#13;
     and tradtonal ways that they have partnered wth the nonprofit sector n&#13;
     the past.&#13;
  · Allow for new partners to jon--Invtng prvate sector firms and or-&#13;
     ganzatons to jon an ntatve s often benefical to the growth, ds-&#13;
     semnaton, and effectveness of the ntatve. Creatng a "closed club"&#13;
     atmosphere s counterproductve to any ntatve that s just begnnng to&#13;
     develop.&#13;
  · Communcate durng the consensus buldng process--Often organza-&#13;
     tons wll gve up too soon. By creatng an open and ongong dalogue&#13;
     durng the consensus and agreement buldng process, you can adjust the&#13;
     agenda, buld a shared vson, and ncrease commtment to the ntatve&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Focus more on identifying model programs and scaling them up&#13;
Several prvate sector representatves were well aware of the excellent work&#13;
and success of specfic Unted Natons, non-profit and non-governmental&#13;
organzatons. It was often suggested that there should be a stronger focus&#13;
on nurturng those organzatons that have met wth success as an appealng&#13;
way for the prvate sector to contrbute to expandng the success of ntatves&#13;
that could be of benefit n other regons or countres. For example, the Global&#13;
Socal Benefit Incubator at Santa Clara State Unversty does an outstandng&#13;
job dentfyng successful developng country-focused ntatves that could be&#13;
brought to other regons or countres.&#13;

                                                                                  17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    Reach out to medium and small firms&#13;
    Many noted a pervasve lack of awareness among small and medum-szed&#13;
    firms about the Mllennum Development Goals themselves and how specfi-&#13;
    cally they can contrbute to achevng them. Even those companes that do&#13;
    have awareness of the MDGs, the majorty stll don't know how to engage&#13;
    to help acheve them. For example, there are over 130 technology firms n&#13;
    Slcon Valley. Hewlett-Packard , Intel, Csco Systems, Sun Mcrosystems,&#13;
    and Solectron are the top five publcly-traded firms n the Valley, but to what&#13;
    extent are we engagng Oracle, Calpne, Aglent, Appled Materals, Apple&#13;
    Computer, CNF, AMD, Maxtor, Sanmna, and JDS whch round out the top&#13;
    fifteen firms? Unfortunately, we tend only to reach out to the top firms n a&#13;
    lmted number of ndustres. There are many firms n many ndustres that are&#13;
    not aware of--or engaged n--development ssues. When they are motvated&#13;
    and energzed about how to respond to a development problem, often they&#13;
    want to engage. Our dscussons found that many of these firms and others&#13;
    would readly engage wth UN organzatons around the MDGs f they were&#13;
    only asked.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Train the innovators and entrepreneurs within the private sector and NGO&#13;
    community who want to build partnerships&#13;
    Unfortunately, many who want to "partner wth the prvate sector" lack the&#13;
    fundamental sklls to negotate the partnershp, plan t, fund t, and mplement&#13;
    t. Many who attempt to collaborate wth the prvate sector have not been&#13;
    traned n the followng areas:&#13;
       · Compettve analyss&#13;
       · Negotaton--creatng a shared vson&#13;
       · Project plannng and mappng&#13;
       · Fnance&#13;
       · Budgetng&#13;
       · Marketng and Communcaton&#13;
       · Dspute resoluton&#13;
       · Reportng&#13;
       · Evaluaton&#13;
        It was suggested that an onlne tranng program that focuses on these core&#13;
    areas s needed to turn bureaucrats nto entrepreneurs, and to encourage more&#13;
    from the non-profit/NGO sector to collaborate wth the prvate sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Build a joint strategy&#13;
Several organzatons are attemptng to collaborate more wth the prvate sec-&#13;
tor on the Mllennum Development Goals ncludng:&#13;
  · Clnton Global Intatve&#13;
  · Corporate Councl on Afrca, Afrcan Busness Roundtable, and NEPAD&#13;
  · Global Socal Benefit Incubator&#13;
  · Prnce of Wales Internatonal Busness Leaders Forum&#13;
  · Seattle Intatve for Global Development&#13;
  · Unted Natons organzatons ncludng the Global Compact, Mllennum&#13;
     Campagn, Unted Natons Chldren's Fund, Unted Natons Fund for&#13;
     Internatonal Partnershps, Unted Natons Development Program, Unted&#13;
     Natons Industral Development Organzaton, and World Bank&#13;
   It was suggested that these groups and others form a jont strategy, hold&#13;
jont conferences on the subject, produce jont papers--even hghlghtng df-&#13;
ferng opnons, and work together to form a shared vson on how to more&#13;
actvely engage wth the prvate sector n achevement of the MDGs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Emulate the successful programs developed by large corporations&#13;
Dr. Ethel M. Cormer of the Procter &amp; Gamble Nutrton Scence Insttute&#13;
emphaszed that "what s mportant s the development of sustanable markets&#13;
and growth." Ther phlanthropc emphass centers on the health and educa-&#13;
ton of chldren n need from 0­13 years (e.g., water purficaton, school buld-&#13;
ng, oral hygene programs, preventve health care through regular medcal&#13;
checkups, and nutrtonal counselng). Dr. Cormer provded useful examples&#13;
of Unted Natons and non-governmental organzatons wth whom they are&#13;
partnerng that could serve as a useful example for others who may be seekng&#13;
potental partners to ther ntatves.&#13;
    Edward E. Mller, Presdent &amp; General Manager, Gas TransBolvano SA&#13;
n Bolva hghlghted the company's "Buldng Trust" and "Collaboraton not&#13;
just Compensaton" programs as well as the Kaa Iya Foundaton that oversees&#13;
the management of the Kaa Iya Natonal Park, the largest n Bolva. GTB&#13;

     Sharma provded several excellent examples of how hs firm and hs founda-&#13;
     ton are touchng the lves of thousands n Inda.&#13;
        Mr. Abdul Wahab Lakhan s Charman of Adamjee Enterprses, a textle&#13;
     manufacturng company employng 00 people n Karach, Pakstan. Adamjee&#13;
     Enterprses s earmarkng a certan percentage of ts profit for charty, and they&#13;
     have allocated addtonal funds to promote educaton of ther workers' chl-&#13;
     dren up to whatever level, ncludng unversty educaton. The firm also has a&#13;
     fund to meet the marrage expenses of employees' daughters.&#13;
        Gb Bulloch s Drector of Accenture Development Partnershps (ADP), an&#13;
     organzaton based n London that allows Accenture's servces to be provded&#13;
     to organzatons that would not normally have access to nternatonal consult-&#13;
     ng servces and to channel these to the parts of the world where there s a&#13;
     clear need. He wrtes, "In ADP, we have effectvely tred to turn Accenture's&#13;
     busness model on ts head; gettng our best performers to work at half salary,&#13;
     Accenture to accept cost neutral returns (.e. non-profit makng) and for the&#13;
     NGO clents to pay fees at a fracton of market rates."&#13;
        "I thnk there may well be many opportuntes for the prvate sector to&#13;
     jon forces to address a partcular generc challenge or non-compettve chal-&#13;
     lenge to ther busness enablng envronment. One such example s the Prvate&#13;
     Investors n Afrca Intatve (PIA) whch s tryng to address HIV/AIDS, whch&#13;
     affects all of these companes n equal measure; ther workers, ther famles,&#13;
     and n turn the communtes n whch they lve. In such cases, unlateral acton&#13;
     may not be economcally effectve or certanly delver less mpact than a fed-&#13;
     eral approach of ths nature. The same thnkng could be appled to the chal-&#13;
     lenges around educaton n country or regon, or developng vocatonal sklls&#13;
     n a workforce. There may be many examples. The queston then s, "Who&#13;
     should be the rng leader?" Busnesses themselves, or s t a role best played by&#13;
     donors or ndeed, a new type of NGO?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Listen--really listen--to the experiences of the private sector trying to work&#13;
with development organizations&#13;
Several spoke canddly about ther frustratons n workng wth development&#13;
organzatons and often encouraged a candd evaluaton and assessment of&#13;
partnershps and allances that perhaps dd not acheve a shared vson or&#13;
defintve results.&#13;
    For example, Dr. Ethel M. Cormer of the Procter &amp; Gamble Nutrton&#13;
Scence Insttute ndcated that ther experence n workng wth government,&#13;
nonprofit, NGOs and multlateral nsttutons has been mxed. She stated that&#13;
dversty of strength s mportant n the partnershp as well as not changng&#13;
the players nvolved. Importantly, she wrtes "I have seen ths work best when&#13;
all players felt on the lne and responsble for the end goal or outcome. Ths s&#13;
ether a self or top-down generated pressure."&#13;
    Also, she states that behavoral preconceptons that each group has about&#13;
the other must be removed: "Governments assume that prvate sector compa-&#13;
nes are not approprately concerned about consumers and the envronment.&#13;
The publc sector beleves that the prvate sector s focused only on profit, but&#13;
has a useful deep pocket to fund ther projects. The prvate sector thnks that&#13;
governments and multlateral nsttutons have such complex and nefficent&#13;
bureaucraces that gettng anythng accomplshed and especally n a tmely&#13;
way s near to mpossble. Or, they beleve that changes n government admn-&#13;
stratons wll lead to changes n leadershp, focus and prevous decsons. Of&#13;
course, these are generaltes that have been based on real events."&#13;
    "A second barrer s our preconceved and sometmes unrealstc expec-&#13;
tatons of each other. For example, NGOs, governments and multlaterals&#13;
often want partnerng prvate sector companes to focus only on the lowest&#13;
economc groups. Ths normally translates to an unrealstc busness propos-&#13;
ton resultng n a consumer prce for a product that not only does not cover&#13;
the cost, but loses money for the company. Companes on the other hand&#13;
wth socal ntatves want local governments to help them wth reachng the&#13;
publc--manufacturng, marketng, awareness, dstrbuton, etc--n unfamlar&#13;
markets. Agan, ths s not always the skll set of those enttes."&#13;
    The followng contrbuton was made by a representatve of the prvate&#13;
sector who partcpated n the July 2005 electronc dscusson on busnesses'&#13;
role n achevement of the MDGs:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                  21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
           "Our experence workng wth varous development-work partners,&#13;
           partcularly multlateral nsttutons n the UN system, has been conss-&#13;
           tently dsappontng. I have met some people who seem wonderful and&#13;
           experenced and enthusastc at the start of a partnershp, but when ac-&#13;
           tual hard, detaled work has to be done, they or ther colleagues seem to&#13;
           dsappear. Ths causes all sorts of problems ncludng the delverable we&#13;
           had hoped to acheve s less good than t mght have been because we&#13;
           end up dong all the work wthout our partner(s), and the reputaton of&#13;
           the UN and development work n general snks even lower n the mnds&#13;
           of the people we are tryng to encourage to become nvolved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         The number one reason some partnershps are more effectve than oth-&#13;
     ers s that "the key players/leaders have decded to devote whatever-t-takes&#13;
     resources of tme and effort to get the project off the ground and to montor t&#13;
     as t proceeds. It s that atttude that filters down through everythng else that&#13;
     happens."&#13;
         Many emphaszed that accountablty of the key players/leaders s also par-&#13;
     amount. "If a project fals to acheve ts goals, a thorough nvestgaton needs&#13;
     to occur and someone needs to be judged. Too often n the UN system, ether&#13;
     a bad project s forgotten by everyone (by mutual agreement) or the project&#13;
     managers are smply found new jobs elsewhere n the UN system where they&#13;
     can be neffectve on someone else's turf."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Suggestions on what the private sector can do in concrete, practical terms&#13;
     One day of the busness-only electronc dscusson was focused on what our&#13;
     representatves of the prvate sector felt needed to be done by the prvate&#13;
     sector to reduce poverty n the world and how the prvate sector could work&#13;
     together to acheve a partcular ntatve. We also asked what knd of help&#13;
     they needed to acheve ther busness' "development prortes." We asked:&#13;
     What opportuntes exst for new allances to make progress on specfic goals,&#13;
     and how can specfic sectors or ndustres collaborate to a common goal? Fol-&#13;
     lowng are some nterestng suggestons:&#13;
         John Banda, Managng Drector for JJ Enterprse n Malaw, opned that&#13;
     the prvate sector's role n helpng to reduce poverty s to play an actve role n&#13;
     reducng llteracy. The prvate sector can:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   · Establsh lteracy classes ether n churches or vllages so that when&#13;
     people have basc educaton, ther level of understandng can change.&#13;
   · Be nvolved n HIV/AIDS educaton. "Most of the poverty s because of&#13;
     orphans who are kept by relatves after losng ther parents."&#13;
   · Employ women who are usually the vctms of poverty.&#13;
   · Work together to acheve a partcular ntatve by jonng ther Chamber&#13;
     of Commence as Chambers can coordnate global ntatves.&#13;
   · Partcpate n conferences to learn from busnesses that are dong some-&#13;
     thng related to the MDGs.&#13;
   Mr. Banda also noted that "the prvate sector needs educaton and tranng&#13;
(a.k.a. capacty buldng) for them to be able to acheve development goals."&#13;
   Abdel Azz El-Aguzy, Charman and CEO of Qunsys n Egypt, felt that&#13;
busnesses can contrbute to poverty reducton by beng as profitable as they&#13;
can be, thus creatng more employment opportuntes. "Of course there are s-&#13;
sues of educaton, tranng and well developed compensaton programs, but a&#13;
country's general busness envronment has a major mpact on opportuntes."&#13;
   "In Egypt, t s estmated that the nformal sector consttutes a huge por-&#13;
ton of economc actvtes that are vastly underutlzed, but there are reasons&#13;
for that--mcro and small busness cannot deal wth a heavy-handed bureau-&#13;
cracy, and there s no benefit to deal wth the banks snce they are reluctant to&#13;
lend to the mcro and small. Provdng educaton n entrepreneurshp s also&#13;
mportant versus the tradtonal model of educaton for the sake of gettng&#13;
degrees."&#13;
   Raul Martnez, Drector of Insttutonal Development for CEMEX n&#13;
Mexco, addressed the ssue of the potental mpact of busnesses around the&#13;
world to reduce poverty by notng that generalzed and extreme poverty was&#13;
the normal condton of human exstence for thousands of years. Some 200&#13;
years ago, prvate enterprses--fueled by the Industral Revoluton--began to&#13;
change thngs:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      "The most mportant socal responsblty task for the prvate sector s&#13;
      to manage our companes efficently n order to grow, to create more&#13;
      jobs, to pay taxes relgously, and to create value for all stakeholders.&#13;
      To reduce poverty, companes must be encouraged to do what they do&#13;
      best: nvest, produce, and grow everywhere....[and] f companes are to&#13;
      prosper, the most mportant condton s to have a government and a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                 23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
            socal system that apples fiscal, legal, educatonal, securty, and credt&#13;
            frameworks that strongly support busness actvtes. If ths had been&#13;
            done worldwde, I assume that over a bllon people would not be lvng&#13;
            n extreme poverty."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         In answer to what the prvate sector can do to reduce poverty (the over-&#13;
     archng goal of the MDGs) n the world, a retal sector commentator wrote&#13;
     that the most obvous steps to poverty reducton would be:&#13;
       · Provde a lvng wage to all workers who produce goods for sale&#13;
       · Make consumers aware of ther responsbltes to the planet&#13;
       · Brng an end to throw-away consumersm where most consumers want&#13;
          the cheapest goods possble&#13;
       · Reverse the trend from the mportance of cheap to the mportance of&#13;
          value&#13;
         The commentator suggested that a mentorng system be developed where&#13;
     "leadng companes mentor or buddy up wth those n the slow lane or off the&#13;
     radar completely to help them take small steps. I feel t s government's role/ob-&#13;
     lgaton to dentfy `champons' who are wllng to mentor others at no cost (a&#13;
     datng agency for development) to match companes together. Governments need&#13;
     to be more actve and nvolved than the tradtonal `encouragement' model."&#13;
         "And we need to hear from consumers. Ordnary consumers are slent&#13;
     but companes clam to respond to ther needs on ths ssue. The best help we&#13;
     could have would be rasng awareness by governments on development ssues&#13;
     and how they mpact on ordnary consumers."&#13;
         And, finally, Edward E. Mller, GTB Presdent and General Manager n&#13;
     Santa Cruz, Bolva wrote that the world's best mnds have been strugglng&#13;
     wth the prvate sector's role to reduce poverty for decades. He submtted that&#13;
     the prvate sector must help communtes wrte ther own busness plans for&#13;
     mprovement projects and provde corporate governance through the comple-&#13;
     ton of the project. "Reducng poverty n the world does not requre large&#13;
     amounts of cash when the prvate sector becomes an actve partner that s&#13;
     fully commtted to helpng people help themselves."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
conclusion&#13;
Many busness leaders ncreasngly understand that contrbutng to develop-&#13;
ment translates nto the creaton of new markets. Per capta ncome s rsng n&#13;
the developng world, openng up vast markets at the "bottom of the pyra-&#13;
md"--for as ncomes rse for four bllon people currently lvng n poverty,&#13;
market opportuntes expand exponentally.&#13;
    At the same tme, busness can contrbute to acceleratng the rse n ncome&#13;
and opportunty by nvestng n nfrastructure, R&amp;D and technologes for the&#13;
developng world; hrng and developng local talent; buyng from developng&#13;
countres; volunteerng talent and tme toward a partcular ssue; donatng&#13;
surplus or used equpment; and makng financal donatons through corporate&#13;
foundatons--because t just makes good busness sense.&#13;
    To be sure, busnesses are ncreasngly nvolved n achevement of the&#13;
goals. But there s so much more that the prvate sector can do to contrbute to&#13;
poverty reducton and acheve the MDGs. Ths paper hghlghts practcal ways&#13;
n whch the prvate sector can become more actvely engaged n contrbutng&#13;
to the achevement of the MDGs based on one-on-one, group, and electronc&#13;
dscussons n whch thought-provokng questons were asked n order to fos-&#13;
ter a frank exchange of vews among peers n the busness sector. We feel that&#13;
these dscussons have led to a deeper understandng of how the prvate sector&#13;
feels about the development challenge, and have exposed nnovatve new ap-&#13;
proaches suggested by the busness communty.&#13;
    Wthout a doubt the prvate sector's nvolvement s a vtal factor n achev-&#13;
ng the Mllennum Development Goals. The purpose of ths paper s to hgh-&#13;
lght the opnons and experences of busness leaders who are deeply engaged&#13;
n global development and poverty reducton ssues. We value ther experence&#13;
n buldng partnershps to reduce poverty and are grateful for ther vson and&#13;
nsghts on the role of busness n global development, and n helpng us to&#13;
dentfy opportuntes and challenges for the task ahead.&#13;

            Business action for the MDGs : Private
            sector involvement as a vital factor in achieving the
            Millennium Development Goals
        </repnme>

            In 2005, the Corporate Social
            Responsibility practice at the World Bank Institute
            conducted a survey to identify examples of business'
            involvement in achievement of the MDGs. Responses were
            received from over 30 organizations directly involved in the
            MDG campaign including the MDG task forces on Childhood
            Education; Childhood Mortality; Technology Access; Hunger;
            and Safe Drinking Water; the Business Council for the United
            Nations; Center for Science, Technology and Society; Earth
            Council Alliance; Equal Access; Global Compact; Millennium
            Campaign; Sister Cities International; TIME International;
            United Nations Fund for International Partnerships; United
            Nations Development Program; United Nations Foundation; the
            World Technology Network, and several from the private
            sector. This survey revealed several examples of direct
            business involvement in partnership initiatives that are
            directly or indirectly related to the Millennium Development
            Goals. This report discusses the variety of ways in which
            the private sector can become involved in development issues
            and in supporting the achievement of the MDGs, the
            incentives for businesses to become involved, and details
            the private sector's involvement in the various task forces.
