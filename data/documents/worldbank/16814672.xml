cited the HWI as an example of a successful hygiene promotion&#13;
program. The program placed particular focus on evidence-&#13;
based communication programming, coupled with a compre-&#13;
hensive training curriculum for partner institutions. In addition,&#13;
two Handwashing with Soap Integration Kits were developed&#13;
for use by health workers and VWU members to give them tools&#13;
to better emphasize handwashing with soap messages across&#13;
their various functions or sectors.16,17&#13;

Partnerships were established with public and private&#13;
institutions, as well as several World Bank investment proj-&#13;

handwashing with soap into programs beyond the sanitation&#13;
sector and outside of WSPâ&#128;&#153;s direct support areas.18 However,&#13;

            Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project :
            results, impacts, and learning from Vietnam
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Vietnam Handwashing Initiative (HWI)
            began in January 2006 with the goal of reducing morbidity
            and mortality from diarrheal diseases in children less than
            five years of age. In December 2006, Vietnam became one of
            four countries in the Water and Sanitation Program's
            (WSP) Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project. The objective
            of the project was to learn how to stimulate improved hand
            washing behaviors at large scale, sustain the activities
            after the project ended, and measure the impact on
            behavioral, health, and welfare outcomes. This learning note
            presents the achievements, learning, and reflections that
            resulted from implementing a large-scale hand washing
            program in Vietnam and provides recommendations for future
            hygiene promotion initiatives. During the four-year
            implementation (2006-2010), the program achieved all four of
            its key objectives. However, a randomized control trial
            (RCT) impact evaluation found no significant changes in hand
            washing behavior and no impact on health in children under
            two. Although much has been learned about how to implement a
            nation-wide communication program in Vietnam, behavior
            change at scale has proven challenging.
