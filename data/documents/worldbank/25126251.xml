This 2015 index of sustainability indicators has been prepared in accordance with the internationally recognized standard for sustainability reporting&#13;
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and comply with the â&#128;&#156;core option.â&#128;&#157; The GRI Index provides an overview of sustainability considerations&#13;
within the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s lending and analytical services as well as its day-to-day operations and management of staff. The World Bank aims to be&#13;
comprehensive in its reporting and thus the Index includes indicators from GRI's Financial Sector Supplement.&#13;
&#13;
The GRI Index covers activities from fiscal 2015, July 1, 2014, through June 30, 2015.&#13;
&#13;
About the World Bank Group&#13;
The World Bank Group plays a key role in the global effort to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. It consists of five institutions: the&#13;
World Bank, which includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association&#13;
(IDA); the International Finance Corporation (IFC); the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA); and the International Centre for&#13;
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). Working together in more than 130 countries, these institutions provide financing, advice, and other&#13;
solutions that enable countries to address the most urgent challenges of development.&#13;
&#13;
This GRI Index addresses the activities of the World Bank and its two agencies. Except for the eligibility of support and terms of lending to member&#13;
countries, the IBRD and IDA are tightly integrated and work as a single unit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
DEFINING THE REPORT&#13;
&#13;
Methodology for Determining Materiality&#13;
&#13;
The topics deemed relevant for disclosure in this GRI Index were identified by assessing annual corporate priorities outlined by the institutionâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
Boards and President and by considering stakeholder input, as well as by ascertaining sustainability impacts of carrying out the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s mission and&#13;
strategy. To determine if a GRI aspect is material for the World Bank to report on, an assessment was carried out based on (1) the potential impact&#13;
on the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s business and (2) the sustainability impacts stemming from its business.&#13;
&amp;#12;Report Boundary&#13;
&#13;
The differentiation between â&#128;&#156;operationalâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;corporateâ&#128;&#157; indicators establishes the boundaries of the GRI Index disclosures.&#13;
&#13;
a. Impacts external to the organization [â&#128;&#156;operational boundaryâ&#128;&#157;]&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank, a development institution, works closely with member country government counterparts and stakeholders to achieve lasing results.&#13;
Indirect impacts occur in member countries as a result of its lending and analytical services and may not be directly controlled by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
management. Impacts stemming from the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s work with clients are specified as â&#128;&#156;operational.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
In terms of satisfying GRI reporting specifications, the World Bank references its entire portfolio of activities, but does not include the performance of&#13;
individual investments in its portfolio. Descriptions of individual investments can be found on the projects website.&#13;
&#13;
b. Impacts internal to the organization [â&#128;&#156;corporate boundaryâ&#128;&#157;]&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Corporate boundaryâ&#128;&#157; refers to the impact from our day-to-day operations on buildings and staff members. GRI indicators for the environment apply&#13;
primarily to performance of Washington, DC, facilities (which house 60 percent of World Bank staff) with Country Office data noted when relevant.&#13;
Indicators related to labor practices apply to global staff policies and practices.&#13;
&#13;
Validating the Methodology: Stakeholder Panel&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank invited selected stakeholders in May 2014 to meet in person to review the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s materiality approach and resulting reporting, and&#13;
advise it in that undertaking for the 2014 reporting cycle. Details are available in the 2014 materiality discussion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RESULTS: WHAT IS MATERIAL?&#13;
&#13;
Operational impact&#13;
&#13;
The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s most pertinent sustainability impacts from financial and technical services to clients can be summarized in the following GRI-&#13;
related aspects:&#13;
&#13;
1. Economic Performanceâ&#128;&#148;Because creating and distributing economic value is part of the mission of eliminating extreme poverty, shareholders&#13;
and investors care about the sustainable economic performance of this institution.&#13;
&#13;
2. Indirect Economic Impactsâ&#128;&#148;These impacts are an essential aspect of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s second goal of ensuring shared prosperity. Numerous&#13;
stakeholders have also asked for better valuation of results, direct and indirect, from World Bank lending and analytical services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                        2&#13;
&amp;#12;3. Biodiversityâ&#128;&#148;Through lending and grant support to client countries, the World Bank Group is one of the largest international funding sources for&#13;
biodiversity worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
4. Human Rights / Child Labor / Indigenous Rightsâ&#128;&#148;The World Bank significantly promotes human rights through its projects, for example,&#13;
improving poor peopleâ&#128;&#153;s access to health, education, food, and water; promoting the participation of Indigenous Peoples in decision making,&#13;
strengthening the accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens; supporting justice reform; and fighting corruption. In addition,&#13;
civil society is actively following the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s current process of updating its safeguard policies. Stakeholders have al so raised concerns about&#13;
inadequate protections for child labor by member countries in projects implemented through World Bank lending.&#13;
&#13;
5. Local Communitiesâ&#128;&#148;The very nature of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s mission is to positively impact communities through investments in education, health, public&#13;
administration, infrastructure, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
6. Anti-corruptionâ&#128;&#148;A well-functioning public sector that delivers quality public services consistent with citizen preferences and fosters private,&#13;
market-led growth while managing its fiscal resources in a prudent manner is critical to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s mission to alleviate pover ty. Opinion&#13;
leaders in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s client countries listed anti-corruption as one of their development priorities.&#13;
&#13;
7. Grievance Mechanisms (environmental and human rights, for impacts on society)â&#128;&#148;Grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) are crucial for&#13;
managing risk in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s portfolio. By offering a channel for citizens to express concerns, comments, and complaints, GRMs create opportunities&#13;
to resolve disputes before they escalate. GRMs can help the Bank and member countries improve project outcomes, prioritize supervision, identify&#13;
systemic issues, and promote accountability. â&#128;&#156;Percent of resolved registered grievancesâ&#128;&#157; is now a key performance indicator f or the World Bank&#13;
(see Corporate Scorecard).&#13;
&#13;
8. Product Portfolio and Audit Aspects from the Financial Sector Supplementâ&#128;&#148;World Bank stakeholders look to the Bank to ensure that policies and&#13;
procedures are in place to assess and screen environmental and social risks in its lending portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
Corporate impact&#13;
&#13;
The most material aspects of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s internal operations include the following:&#13;
&#13;
1. Staff are the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s greatest asset. They bring a wide range of perspectives to bear on poverty-reduction issues and emerging&#13;
development challenges, and are critical to the effectiveness of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s core operational and knowledge services. Staff-related indicators are&#13;
pulled from the following GRI aspect categories: economic performance, market presence, employment, occupational health and safety, training&#13;
and education, diversity and equal opportunity, labor practices grievance mechanisms, and nondiscrimination.&#13;
&#13;
2. The Bank recognizes that reducing its own corporate environmental impacts is in line with the institutional mission to reduce poverty, as&#13;
environmental degradation affects the worldâ&#128;&#153;s poor disproportionately. Increasing the efficiency of how the organization runs its businessâ&#128;&#148;through&#13;
facility-level and staff-behavior changesâ&#128;&#148;reduces natural-resource waste and decreases the cost of day-to-day operations. Key aspects related to&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                         3&#13;
&amp;#12;the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s environmental footprint include the following: energy, emissions, effluents and waste, and procurement practices (including supplier&#13;
environmental assessment, supplier assessment for impacts on society, and supplier human rights assessment).&#13;
&#13;
For the fiscal 2015 Index, the GRI aspects â&#128;&#156;materialsâ&#128;&#157; and â&#128;&#156;procurement practicesâ&#128;&#157; were not deemed material based on the methodology used. This&#13;
was mainly because World Bank stakeholders were not asking the Bank how it managed its corporate procurement practices. Thus these aspects&#13;
scored low on the materiality scale. The Bank continues to consider its procurement practices an essential part of reducing its footprint impact;&#13;
therefore, information about these practices are included in The 2015 Sustainability Report (PDF).&#13;

                              The World Bank works with its member countries to achieve equitable and sustainable economic growth in&#13;
                              their national economies and find solutions to pressing regional and global problems in economic development&#13;
                              and in other important areas, such as environmental sustainability.&#13;
                              Despite progress during the past decades, humanity still faces urgent and complex challenges. More than 1&#13;
                              billion people live in destitution, making eliminating extreme poverty a continuing priority. Against a backdrop&#13;
                              of rising inequality and social exclusion in many countries, poverty remains an urgent challenge. The simple-&#13;
                              sounding mission has proven to be a complex issue, with multiple dimensions requiring coordinated action&#13;
                              from the entire international community on many policy fronts. Combining concern for greater equity with the&#13;
                              need for growth will help to ensure that the bottom 40 percent of society will share in prosperity.&#13;
       Description of key     The World Bank believes that the depth and breadth of its sectoral knowledge, along with its range of financial&#13;
G4-2   impacts, risks, and    and technical assistance instruments, can help countries address these challenges. With this in mind, the&#13;
       opportunities&#13;
                              World Bank Group has set two goals: (1) strive toward reducing the extreme poverty rate to no more than 3&#13;
                              percent in 2030 and (2) promote shared prosperity by fostering income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the&#13;
                              population in every country. It endeavors to pursue both of these goals in an environmentally, socially, and&#13;
                              fiscally sustainable way.&#13;

                              prosperity is available in the World Bank Group Strategy. Unveiled at the 2013 Annual Meetings, the strategy&#13;
                              brings together for the first time the combined strength of the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA and places the&#13;
                              collective institution in a position to become the â&#128;&#156;Solutions Bank with results for the poor as our central&#13;
                              benchmark.â&#128;&#157; In addition, to ensure the availability of adequate resources that are aligned with the twin goals&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                           6&#13;
&amp;#12;                      and its strategy, the World Bank Group has undertaken significant financial reforms that will increase its&#13;
                      capacity to provide lending services to clients while strengthening its financial resilience. Performance for&#13;
                      these goals includes more than one indicator.&#13;
                      Improved client servicesâ&#128;&#148;which will ultimately help the World Bank Group deliver on its goalsâ&#128;&#148;can only&#13;
                      happen within a strong risk-management culture and framework that preserve the Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s reputation&#13;
                      and financial sustainability in an increasingly uncertain and challenging environment. The Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                      approach involves the proactive identification and management of risk in operations to ensure that risks are&#13;
                      adequately assessed, measured, monitored, and reported so that corrective action can be taken, if necessary,&#13;

                      The Bank Group faces a variety of risks related to development impacts, environmental and social safeguards,&#13;
                      integrity, and financial management. It manages them through a customized risk rating and regular monitoring&#13;
                      system as well as through engagement with clients. It manages other risks, including fiscal and operational&#13;
                      risks, using leading industry practices and standards adapted to the Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s purposes.&#13;
                      As both a development and a financial institution, the World Bank Group faces special challenges in the&#13;
                      current environment. Initiatives in fiscal 2015 on financing for development, the Sustainable Development&#13;
                      Goals, and climate change will affect the development agenda for years to come. The emergence of new&#13;
                      multilateral development institutions creates both opportunities and challenges for creative partnerships and&#13;
                      requires fresh thinking about the financial structure of the World Bank Group.&#13;

                                   As a global citizen and a global employer, the World Bank consults and collaborates with thousands of&#13;
                                   stakeholders throughout the world. The Bank groups the stakeholders into two main categories: internal and&#13;
        Stakeholder groups&#13;
                                   external. Internal stakeholders include Bank owners (shareholder governments) and Bank employees (internal&#13;
G4-24   engaged by the&#13;
                                   staff). External stakeholders include civil society, faith-based organizations, academics, foundations,&#13;
        organization&#13;
                                   parliamentarians, citizens impacted by projects, private sector (including socially responsible investors),&#13;
                                   partnering agencies, and international, national, and local media.&#13;
&#13;
        The basis for              In the context of World Bank-supported activities, stakeholders are considered those who are affected,&#13;
        identification and         whether positively or negatively, by a proposed intervention. Who the stakeholders are for any given project or&#13;
G4-25   selection of               issue depends on the situation. Getting the necessary stakeholders involved is essential, but it is not always&#13;
        stakeholders with whom     easy, because our stakeholders range from donor and client governments to the poorest and most&#13;
        to engage                  marginalized communities.&#13;
&#13;
        The organizationâ&#128;&#153;s          Member governments         Engagement is built into the management structures. Each fall and spring,&#13;

                          Employees       Staff surveys are used to engage staff. In November 2015, a World Bank&#13;
                                          Group Employee Engagement Survey was conducted to measure staff's&#13;
                                          views on a variety of key areasâ&#128;&#148;from leadership to career development to&#13;
                                          the work environment.&#13;
&#13;
                          Civil society   Engagement ranges from focus groups to community panels to invitations to&#13;
                                          participate in and contribute substantively to policy discussions during the&#13;
                                          Annual Meetings. Twice a year, during the Spring and Annual Meetings, the&#13;
                                          World Bank hosts the Civil Society Policy Forum, where civil society&#13;
                                          representatives from around the world convene to deliberate priority&#13;
                                          development issues with a broad group of stakeholders. At the global and&#13;
                                          regional levels, civil society organizations (CSOs) have been formally&#13;
                                          consulted on the major policies introduced or updated in recent years by&#13;
                                          World Bank staff in such areas as access to information, social&#13;
                                          accountability, and environmental and social safeguards. Consultations have&#13;
                                          also become common; they are based on such reports as the annual World&#13;
                                          Development Report (WDR) and evaluations carried out by the Independent&#13;
                                          Evaluation Group (IEG). At the country level, the World Bank consults with a&#13;
                                          broad spectrum of CSOs on the System Country Diagnostic, the Country&#13;
                                          Partnership Framework, sector studies, and individual Bank-funded&#13;
                                          development projects. Often these consultations are multi-stakeholder and&#13;
                                          involve CSOs, governments, businesses, and other donor agencies. With the&#13;
                                          introduction of the Citizens Engagement Strategic Framework, the Bank has&#13;
                                          committed to 100 percent beneficiary feedback, for which the views of civil&#13;

                      Social Accountability (GPSA) supports civil society and governments to work&#13;
                      together to solve critical governance challenges in developing countries. To&#13;
                      achieve this objective, the GPSA provides strategic and sustained support to&#13;
                      CSOsâ&#128;&#153; social accountability initiatives aimed at strengthening transparency&#13;

Citizens and others   Stakeholder consultations are a time-limited engagement platform through&#13;
                      which interested and impacted parties can share their input and perspectives&#13;
                      on a proposed area of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s work. This exercise is done with the&#13;
                      objective of influencing decisions. Therefore, the objective of consultations is&#13;
                      to seek the views of those affected by our work but outside the internal&#13;
                      decision-making process. By ensuring that affected and interested parties&#13;
                      express their views about a particular policy, strategy, study, or program, and&#13;
                      by ensuring that a wide range of potential impacts is taken into account, the&#13;
                      Bankâ&#128;&#153;s decision-making process becomes better informed, more rigorous,&#13;
                      and more accountable. Moreover, consultation has become an essential&#13;
                      component of the open and accessible governance of the institution.&#13;
                      Consultation methods and formats vary depending on the scope of the World&#13;
                      Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s proposed engagement (local, regional, national, or global), the&#13;
                      purpose of the engagement, the nature of the issues being discussed, and&#13;
                      the parties and stakeholders interested in influencing the outcome of the&#13;

                      and tracks the perceptions of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s clients, partners, and other&#13;
                      stakeholders across the globe in member countries. For more information,&#13;

Local, national, and     On a daily basis, the World Bank approaches media to cover its major report&#13;
international media      launches, corporate priority campaigns, and messages, including events&#13;
                         involving the President. At key opportunities, like the Annual and Spring&#13;
                         Meetings, the Bank proactively drives the primary messages of the institution,&#13;
                         such as its commitment to the twin goals of ending extreme poverty by 2030&#13;
                         and boosting shared prosperity. The Bank approaches traditional media&#13;
                         outlets (via interviews and op-eds) and actively uses social media to promote&#13;
                         issues that need to be addressed to achieve those goals, such as major&#13;
                         reports on climate change. It also responds to all media queries and interview&#13;
                         requests to help the media better understand the Bank and what it does. In&#13;
                         addition, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s reputation is managed by working with reporters to clarify&#13;
                         Bank priorities and activities, providing them with institution views so they can&#13;
                         write balanced and well-represented articles. Press releases, speeches,&#13;
                         transcripts, and feature stories from the Bank can be found on the World&#13;

                         The key priority in fiscal year 2015 was the continued promotion and&#13;
                         implementation of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s twin goals. This included outreach to key&#13;
                         audiences through mechanisms such as press releases, op-eds, report&#13;
                         launches, and other stakeholder engagement about activities achieve these&#13;
                         goals. Significant communications efforts were also directed toward the Bank&#13;

&amp;#12;                                  The World Bank's mission is to fight poverty with passion and professionalism for lasting results. The twin&#13;
                                  goals--ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity--guide the mission. To achieve the goals, the&#13;
                                  Bank strives to promote environmental and social sustainability at the country and global levels, and to pursue&#13;
                                  a fiscally responsible development path. It seeks to help people help themselves and their environment by&#13;
                                  providing resources, sharing knowledge, building capacity, and forging partnerships in the public and private&#13;
                                  sectors. The institutionâ&#128;&#153;s core values are personal honesty, integrity, and commitment; working together in&#13;
                                  teams with openness and trust; empowering others and respecting differences; encouraging risk-taking and&#13;

                                  There is a mandatory e-learning training on the Code of Conduct for all new staff, including consultants with&#13;
                                  contracts of more than 30 days. There is a separate Code of Conduct for Board officials. Business partners&#13;
                                  are informed of ethics expectations through a separate Code of Conduct document.&#13;
                                  In addition to the training for new staff, a number of ethics training courses are offered at the WBG. For&#13;

                                  In 2012, the World Bank Group elevated the head of the ethics function to a vice presidency. As indicated in a&#13;

                                  and Group CEO reflects the importance attached to EBCâ&#128;&#153;s mandate across its four key areas of responsibility:&#13;
                                  (1) responding to and investigating allegations of staff misconduct, and policies and procedures; (2) providing&#13;

&amp;#12;                                    The Office of Ethics and Business Conduct (EBC) enables staff members to seek ethics-related advice and&#13;
                                    guidance. Employees, business partners, and other stakeholders are informed of EBCâ&#128;&#153;s advisory services&#13;
                                    through a range of communication media. EBC advisory services are cited in various training programs offered&#13;
                                    by the WBG.&#13;
                                    The Ethics Helpline is an email service account (ethics_helpline@worldbank.org) that is accessible to staff and&#13;
                                    advertised on the external website. Staff members also can seek advice directly from EBC staff during office&#13;
                                    hours or arrange to speak with advisory team members at a convenient time. Most advisory services are&#13;
                                    provided in English, which is the working language of the World Bank. Staff members can also contact the&#13;
                                    Ethics Helpline 24/7 by phone (800-261-7497), which is administered in multiple languages by an outside&#13;
                                    vendor.&#13;
        Internal and external&#13;
                                    Advisory requests are treated with the highest possible level of confidentiality given the requirements of the&#13;
        mechanisms for seeking&#13;
                                    case. However, requesting advice on a misconduct matter does not provide immunity in relation to this&#13;
        advice on ethical and&#13;
                                    misconduct. In most cases, with this exception, advice is treated confidentially. Requests for advice can be&#13;

        organizational integrity,   There were 830 requests for advice and guidance received by EBC in fiscal 2015. The most frequently&#13;
        such as helplines or        received queries involved questions concerning a staff memberâ&#128;&#153;s outside activities. For additional information&#13;
        advice lines                on the types of requests received, refer to EBCâ&#128;&#153;s Annual Reports, posted online.&#13;
                                    EBC does not currently administer a satisfaction survey to individuals who contact the office. However,&#13;
                                    individuals who approach the office frequently express satisfaction, in particular because most requests for&#13;

&amp;#12;         The World Bank is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world. The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s lending&#13;
         is aimed at two different groups of countries: IBRD strives to reduce poverty in middle-income and credit-worthy poorer countries through&#13;
         loans, guarantees, risk-management products, and analytical and advisory services. Its companion organization, IDA, offers below-market-&#13;
         rate financing to the worldâ&#128;&#153;s 77 poorest countries, primarily through credits and grants.&#13;
         IBRD funds itself through high-quality bonds offered in the international capital markets. IDAâ&#128;&#153;s funding is predominantly from contributions&#13;
G4-DMA&#13;
         by donor countries, including OECD countries and, increasingly, middle-income nations.&#13;
         The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Corporate Scorecard is designed to provide a snapshot of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s overall performance in the context of development&#13;
         results. It facilitates strategic dialogue between management and the Board on progress made and areas that need attention. Aspects of&#13;
         financial strength are measured under the Scorecardâ&#128;&#153;s Tier III, which reviews the overall success of Bank activities in achieving&#13;
         development goals and examines the effectiveness of Bank operations, including the performance of its lending portfolio.&#13;

                                     As of June 30, 2015, the value of accrued pension liabilities for IBRD/IDA was $15.9&#13;
                                     billion, supported by assets held in trust of $15.2 billion. The funded ratio (asset over&#13;
                                     liabilities) was 96 percent as of June 30, 2015.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Assets are evaluated at their fair value, and liabilities are measured as the Projected&#13;

                                     expenses of the Staff Retirement Plan. The employer contribution is based on a&#13;

         The World Bank is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world. It is not a bank in the&#13;
         ordinary sense, but a unique partnership formed to reduce poverty and support development. The Bank supports a wide array of&#13;
         investments in such areas as education, health, public administration, infrastructure, financial and private sector development, agriculture,&#13;
         and environmental and natural resource management.&#13;
G4-DMA   The Bank has established ambitious but achievable goals to galvanize international and national efforts: (1) strive toward reducing the&#13;
         extreme poverty rate to no more than 3 percent in 2030 and (2) promote shared prosperity by fostering income growth of the bottom 40&#13;
         percent of the population in every country. It endeavors to pursue both of these goals in an environmentally, socially, and fiscally&#13;
         sustainable way. The World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Corporate Scorecard measures the progress on these goals. The results provide key sectoral&#13;

                                      The World Bank works with its borrowing country members to achieve equitable and&#13;
                                      sustainable economic growth in their national economies and to find solutions to&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Countries rely on healthy ecosystems and biodiversity to survive, grow enough food, and make a living. But the world is experiencing a&#13;
         dramatic loss of biodiversity, negatively affecting livelihoods, clean water supply, food security, and resilience to environmental disasters.&#13;
         This situation particularly affects the 75 percent of the world's poor who live in rural areas and often rely on ecosystems to make a living.&#13;
&#13;
G4-DMA   The World Bank works with countries around the world to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity. With a portfolio of 229 projects worth&#13;
         $1.078 billion in the 10 years from fiscal 2006 through 2015, the World Bank is one of the largest international financiers of biodiversity&#13;
         conservation and sustainable use.&#13;
         The World Bank helps countries put policies in place so that biodiversity is valued as a key driver of sustainable development. It works with&#13;
         clients to improve their administration to better conserve and sustainably use their biodiversity. The Bank invests in those aspects of&#13;
                                                                                                                                                    26&#13;
&amp;#12;          biodiversity servicesâ&#128;&#148;such as watershed management and protected areasâ&#128;&#148;that help countries achieve their development goals. The&#13;
          World Bank also helps countries find ways to generate revenues from biodiversity, such as tourism income, in addition to fighting wildlife&#13;
          crime. Biodiversity projects range from establishing and strengthening terrestrial, freshwater, and marine protected areas, to eradicating&#13;
          invasive alien species, to improving biodiversity management planning in the production landscape.&#13;
          The World Bank does not support projects that involve the significant conversion or degradation of critical natural habitats. Wherever&#13;
          feasible, Bank-financed projects are sited on already converted lands. The Bank does not support projects involving the significant&#13;
          conversion of natural habitats unless there are no feasible alternatives for the project and its siting, and comprehensive analysis&#13;
          demonstrates that overall benefits from the project substantially outweigh the environmental costs. If the environmental assessment&#13;
          indicates that a project would significantly convert or degrade natural habitats, the project takes mitigation measures, including minimizing&#13;
          habitat loss and establishing and maintaining an ecologically similar protected area. In deciding whether to support a project with potential&#13;
          adverse impacts on a natural habitat, the Bank takes into account the borrower's ability to implement the appropriate conservation and&#13;
          mitigation measures.&#13;
          A 2010 review of the Bank's safeguard policies regime by the Independent Evaluation Group found that 11 percent of projects triggered&#13;
          Operational Policy 4.04 on Natural Habitats. Among these, the policy was satisfactory in 72 percent of cases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       The Bank supports the protection, maintenance, and rehabilitation of natural habitats&#13;
                                       and their functions in its economic and sector work, project financing, and policy&#13;
                                       dialogue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       From fiscal 2006 to 2015, 87 projects supported habitat-protected or -restored areas,&#13;
                                       with a geographic emphasis on Latin America and the Caribbean region, with 31&#13;
                                       projects, and Africa, with 29 projects. There were 16 projects in East Asia and the&#13;
                                       Pacific, 6 in Eastern and Central Asia, 2 in Middle East and North Africa, 2 in South&#13;

                                       in East and Central Asia, 2 in Latin America and the Caribbean region).&#13;
                                       Bank projects with natural habitat components include appropriate environmental&#13;
                                       expertise for project preparation, appraisal, and supervision arrangements to ensure&#13;
                                       adequate design and implementation of mitigation measures. Global and regional&#13;
                                       partnerships play an important role in promoting biodiversity conservation. Some of the&#13;
                                       key partnerships are as follows:&#13;

&#13;
         The World Bank has two ambitious goals: to eliminate extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. Poverty, as&#13;
         the Bank recognizes it, encompasses lack of opportunities (including capabilities), lack of voice and representation, and vulnerability to&#13;
         shocks.&#13;
         Grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) are crucial for managing risk in the Bank â&#128;&#153;s portfolio. GRMs create opportunities to resolve disputes&#13;
         before they escalate by offering a channel for citizens to express concerns, comments, and complaints. Beyond their benefits to citizens,&#13;
         GRMs can help the Bank and client improve project outcomes, prioritize supervision, identify systemic issues, and promote accountability.&#13;
         The Bank promotes human rights principles through the projects it supports, for example, improving poor people's access to health&#13;
G4-DMA   services, education, food, and water. Moreover, the Bank promotes the participation of project-affected people, including Indigenous&#13;
         Peoples, in decision making and participation; helps strengthen the accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens; and&#13;
         supports justice reform and fighting corruption. Although development projects are intended to bring about positive change, their&#13;
         implementation involves risks, and people or the environment can be adversely impacted. The Bank has policies to help avoid such&#13;
         unintended outcomes, but some problems may remain unrecognized or unaddressed. In such circumstances, citizens must speak out to&#13;
         bring attention to these problems. This can be done either through project-level Grievance Redress Mechanisms or the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s corporate-&#13;
         level Grievance Redress Service (GRS), which was established in January 2015 to field complaints that could not be addressed at the&#13;
         country level. This mechanism complements the borrowerâ&#128;&#153;s project-level grievance mechanisms (where they exist), and the Boardâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
         Inspection Panel.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                               28&#13;
&amp;#12;          The Environmental and Social Standards-Advisory Team (ESSAT) leads the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s corporate work on grievance redress. GRS provides a&#13;
          consistent and systematic approach to the handling of complaints and conflict resolution across all IBRD/IDA operations. The work involves&#13;
          a number of the Bank's major initiatives, in particular, work on risk, results, and beneficiary feedback.&#13;
          The Global Review of Grievance Redress Mechanisms found that half of all Bank projects featured a GRM in project-design documents.&#13;
          However, new research shows implementation challenges.&#13;
          A major focus for the Bank in the future will be to further integrate grievance redress in all projects, increase support for implementation,&#13;
          and enhance collection and monitoring of grievances received and resolved across the projectâ&#128;&#153;s portfolio.&#13;

          The Bank significantly promotes human rights principles in a range of areas, including: (1) improving poor people's access to health&#13;
          services, education, food, and water, (2) promoting the participation of project-affected communities, including Indigenous Peoples, in&#13;
          decision-making, (3) strengthening the accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens, and (4) supporting justice reform&#13;
          and fighting corruption. Thus, the Bank's role is facilitative, helping its members realize their human rights obligations.&#13;
          The Bank screens each project proposed for financing to determine the appropriate extent and type of environmental and social analysis to&#13;
          be undertaken during project preparation, and whether the project may involve the use or application of other safeguard policies. Policies&#13;
          that may be triggered include: OP/BP 4.01, Environmental Assessment; OP/BP 4.04, Natural Habitats; OP 4.09, Pest Management; OP/BP&#13;
G4-DMA    4.10, Indigenous Peoples; OP/BP 4.11, Physical Cultural Resources; OP/BP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement; OP 4.36, Forests; and OP/BP&#13;
          4.37, Safety of Dams. In addition, the Bank recognizes that gender issues are important dimensions of its poverty reduction, economic&#13;
          growth, human wellbeing, and development effectiveness agenda. OP/BP 4.20 establishes a country-level, strategic approach to&#13;

          The Bank classifies the proposed project into one of four categories (A, B, C, and FI) depending on the type, location, sensitivity, and scale&#13;
          of the project, and the nature and magnitude of its potential environmental impacts. The borrower is responsible for any assessment&#13;
          required by the safeguard policies, with Bank staff providing general advice. Depending on the type of project and its safeguard policy&#13;
          category, the Bank project design incorporates into project development such issues as public consultation, environmental and social&#13;

         In October 2012, the World Bank launched a review and update of its policies to protect people and the environment in its projects. The&#13;
         World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s environmental and social safeguard policies contribute to sustainability and development effectiveness in Bank projects and&#13;
         programs by helping to avoid or mitigate harm to people and the environment. The goal of this review and update is to better align these&#13;
         policies with the changing needs and aspirations of borrowers, the external context, and the business of the Bank. The third phase of&#13;
         external consultations on the proposed Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) is now underway. For updates, see&#13;

         The World Bank recognizes that child labor is one of the most devastating consequences of persistent poverty. All standard World Bank&#13;
         bidding documents contain a clause prohibiting the use of child or forced labor in contracts financed under any World Bank projects. Staff in&#13;
G4-DMA&#13;
         Bank-supported operations are required to assess social issues such as child labor within the environmental and social aspects of the&#13;
         projects to mitigate risk.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Concerns have been raised about the practice in Uzbekistan of using forced child and&#13;
                                      adult labor for cotton harvesting.&#13;
                                      Projects that could potentially relate to cotton production in Uzbekistan include&#13;
                                      measures to prevent the occurrence of child or forced labor within the Bank-supported&#13;
                                      projects, and further seek to contribute to achieving this beyond the project boundaries.&#13;
                                      These include the following requirements: government compliance with national&#13;
                                      legislation that prohibits the use of child or forced labor; implementation of a third-party&#13;
         Operations and               monitoring and feedback mechanism that focuses on child or forced labor issues in&#13;
         suppliers identified as      connection with the project activities or within the project area; the full collaboration of&#13;

         taken to contribute to       awareness, and outreach activities about labor legislation and the regulations against&#13;
         the effective abolition of   child or forced labor. Such measures are also reflected in binding project covenants in&#13;
         child labor                  the relevant financing agreements. Independent of this, the Bank retains the right to&#13;
                                      exercise remedies in cases of borrower noncompliance with the financing agreement.&#13;
                                      Since 2013, the Government of Uzbekistan has implemented a range of measures to&#13;
                                      fully eliminate child labor and reduce the risks of forced labor in the country. The World&#13;
                                      Bank has pursued intensive policy dialogue with the Government to address these&#13;
                                      issues in the context of broader agricultural sector reforms, and has developed a&#13;
                                      Support Program for Labor Reform in the Uzbekistan Cotton Sector, to be funded&#13;

         Central to the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s mission of reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development is ensuring that the development process fully&#13;
         respects the dignity, human rights, economies, and cultures of Indigenous Peoples. The Bank recognizes that the identities and cultures of&#13;
         Indigenous Peoples are inextricably linked to the lands on which they live and the natural resources on which they depend. These distinct&#13;
         circumstances expose Indigenous Peoples to different types of risks and levels of impacts from development projects, including loss of&#13;
         identity, culture, and customary livelihoods. Gender and intergenerational issues among Indigenous Peoples also are complex. As social&#13;
         groups with identities that are often distinct from dominant groups in their national societies, Indigenous Peoples are frequently among the&#13;
         most marginalized and vulnerable segments of the population. As a result, their economic, social, and legal status often limits their capacity&#13;
         to defend their interests in and rights to lands, territories, and other productive resources, or restricts their ability to participate in and benefit&#13;
         from development. At the same time, the Bank recognizes that Indigenous Peoples play a vital role in sustainable development and that&#13;
         their rights are increasingly being addressed under both domestic and international law.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         The World Bank policy on Indigenous Peoples, OP/BP 4.10, Indigenous Peoples, underscores the need for borrowers and Bank staff to&#13;
G4-DMA&#13;
         identify Indigenous Peoples, consult with them, and ensure that they participate in and benefit from Bank-funded operations in a culturally&#13;
         appropriate way. It also emphasizes that adverse impacts on them are avoided or, where not feasible, minimized or mitigated. For all&#13;
         projects that are proposed for Bank financing and involve Indigenous Peoples, the Bank requires the borrower to engage in a process of&#13;
         free, prior, and informed consultation. The Bank provides project financing only where there is broad community support to the project by&#13;
         the affected Indigenous Peoples.&#13;
         In 2012, the World Bank began a process to update the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s environmental and social safeguard policies, in an effort to better address&#13;
         new development challenges and reflect current international good practice. Part of the ongoing review is a Global Dialogue and&#13;
         Engagement process with Indigenous Peoples that aims to include Indigenous Peoples in the ongoing Review and Update of the World&#13;
         Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), and to strengthen World Bank support to and engagement with Indigenous Peoples.&#13;
         The consultations on the proposed framework have included a number of dedicated Indigenous Peoples Dialogue sessions that have&#13;
         yielded important results in terms of participation, information gathered, and the beginning of a renewed and stronger relationship with&#13;
         Indigenous Peoples. For more information, see http://www.worldbank.org/indigenouspeoples.&#13;

&#13;
         The World Bank has two ambitious goals: to eliminate extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. Poverty, as&#13;
         the Bank recognizes it, encompasses lack of opportunities (including capabilities), lack of voice and representation, and vulnerability to&#13;
         shocks.&#13;
         Grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) are crucial for managing risk in the Bank â&#128;&#153;s portfolio. GRMs create opportunities to resolve disputes&#13;
         before they escalate by offering a channel for citizens to express concerns, comments, and complaints. Beyond their benefits to citizens,&#13;
         GRMs can help the Bank and clients improve project outcomes, prioritize supervision, identify systemic issues, and promote accountability.&#13;
         The Bank promotes human rights principles through the projects it supports, for example, improving poor peopleâ&#128;&#153;s access to health&#13;
         services, education, food, and water. Moreover, the Bank promotes the participation of project-affected people, including Indigenous&#13;
         Peoples, in decision making and participation; helps strengthen the accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens; and&#13;
         supports justice reform and fighting corruption. Although development projects are intended to bring about positive change, their&#13;
G4-DMA   implementation involves risks, and people or the environment can be adversely impacted. The Bank has policies to help avoid such&#13;
         unintended outcomes, but some problems may remain unrecognized or unaddressed. In such circumstances, citizens must speak out to&#13;
         bring attention to these problems. This can be done either through project-level Grievance Redress Mechanisms or the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s corporate-&#13;
         level Grievance Redress Service (GRS), which was established in January 2015 to field complaints that could not be addressed at the&#13;
         country level. This mechanism complements the borrowerâ&#128;&#153;s project-level grievance mechanisms (where they exist) and the Boardâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
         Inspection Panel.&#13;
         The Environmental and Social Standards-Advisory Team (ESSAT) leads the Bank's corporate work on grievance redress. GRS provides a&#13;
         consistent and systematic approach to the handling of complaints and conflict resolution across all IBRD/IDA operations. The work involves&#13;
         a number of the Bank's major initiatives, in particular, work on risk, results, and beneficiary feedback.&#13;
         The Global Review of Grievance Redress Mechanisms found that half of all Bank projects featured a GRM in project-design documents.&#13;
         However, new research shows implementation challenges.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                33&#13;
&amp;#12;          A major focus for the Bank in the future will be to further integrate grievance redress in all projects, increase support for implementation,&#13;
          and enhance collection and monitoring of grievances received and resolved across the projectâ&#128;&#153;s portfolio.&#13;

          The very nature of the World Bank's mission is to positively impact communities through investments in education, health, public&#13;
          administration, infrastructure, financial and private-sector development, agriculture, and environmental and natural resource management.&#13;
          Our stakeholders are consulted at different points throughout our projects and policy development. In recent years, the World Bank has&#13;
          increasingly focused on lending to community-driven development (CDD) programs in order to let communities lead their own&#13;
          development. This process lets communities identify their own development priorities, design the relevant response, manage project funds,&#13;
          hire contractors, and, on completion of construction, manage and sustain the project. CDD approaches have been used to support a range&#13;
          of local development and service delivery needs identified by communities themselves, including water supply and sanitation, school and&#13;
          health facilities construction, rural roads, bridges and other access infrastructure, nutrition programs for mothers and infants, and support&#13;
G4-DMA    for livelihoods and microenterprises.&#13;
          Worldwide, CDD has attracted a growing body of robust impact and other evaluations demonstrating results, and the portfolio has become&#13;
          much more closely monitored, using, among other technologies, geo-tagging and SMS-based grievance redress systems. Robust impact&#13;
          evaluations generally find positive evidence of poverty reduction, targeting of the poor, and increased access to services; evidence is&#13;
          limited or mixed on these programsâ&#128;&#153; effect on governance, social capital spillovers (such as local collective action or trust among&#13;
          members), and conflict impact.&#13;
          Increased training, knowledge exchange, and quality assurance (through the Global Solutions Group) improves program designs, and&#13;
          increased evaluations and analytical work advances the approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          Percentage of                Community-driven development (CDD) programs operate on the principles of local&#13;
          operations with              empowerment, participatory governance, demand responsiveness, administrative&#13;
G4-SO1    implemented local            autonomy, greater downward accountability, and enhanced local capacity. Experience                     Full&#13;
          community                    has shown that when given clear explanations of the process, access to information and&#13;
          engagement, impact           appropriate capacity, and financial support, poor men and women can effectively&#13;
                                                                                                                                                       34&#13;

                                 The World Bank recognizes that CDD approaches and actions are important elements&#13;
                                 of an effective strategy for poverty reduction and sustainable development. Over the&#13;
                                 past decade, the Bank has increasingly focused on lending to CDD programs to reach&#13;

         Critical to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s mission is a well-functioning public sector that delivers quality public services consistent with citizen&#13;
         preferences and fosters private, market-led growth, while managing its fiscal resources in a prudent manner. Bank operations across&#13;
         sectors systematically incorporate governance and anticorruption measures into project design. The objective is to better manage&#13;
         corruption and fiduciary risks and ensure that development funds are used for their intended purposes. The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Integrity Vice&#13;
         Presidency (INT) plays an important role in this respect.&#13;
         INT investigates allegations of fraud and corruption in World Bankâ&#128;&#147;supported activities (external investigations), as well as allegations of&#13;
         significant fraud and corruption involving Bank staff and vendors (internal investigations). INT also pursues sanctions against firms and&#13;
         individuals who have engaged in sanctionable misconduct. The resulting debarments prevent these parties from participating in future&#13;
G4-DMA&#13;
         Bank-financed projects and serve as a deterrent to other potential wrongdoers.&#13;
         Within INT, the Integrity Compliance Office works closely with sanctioned entities to promote the adoption and implementation of corporate&#13;
         compliance standards consistent with the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Integrity Compliance Guidelines. Sanctioned entities must satisfy certain&#13;
         compliance conditions in order to be released from sanction. At the end of this fiscal year, the Integrity Compliance Office was engaging&#13;
         with 40 entities regarding their efforts toward satisfaction of their compliance conditions. By combining investigations with an enhanced&#13;
         focus on compliance, detection of red flags, and building preventive measures in projects, INT promotes a proactive approach to managing&#13;
         fraud and corruption risks. It is vital to manage these risks in an efficient and effective manner as they can impact development resources,&#13;
         particularly in fragile contexts and high-risk sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      In fiscal 2015, INT received 323 complaints about possible fraud and corruption in World&#13;
                                      Bankâ&#128;&#147;financed projects, leading to 99 new investigations. Among those reporting&#13;

         operations assessed for&#13;
                                      misconduct in fiscal 2015 involved 61 projects and 93 contracts worth about $540.9&#13;

                                     Within INT, the Preventive Services Unit (PSU) worked with more than 200 Task Teams&#13;
                                     across the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s six regions. PSU assisted 94 Task Teams in building&#13;
                                     precautions against fraud and corruption in their projects. Considerable efforts were&#13;
                                     devoted to the development of knowledge products, in particular, improved data&#13;
                                     analytics, resulting in the first Integrity Risk Scan. Thanks to PSUâ&#128;&#153;s business&#13;
                                     intelligence, integrity risks were identified before they materialized and allowed for&#13;

         The World Bank has two ambitious goals: to eliminate extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. Poverty, as&#13;
         the Bank recognizes it, encompasses lack of opportunities (including capabilities), lack of voice and representation, and vulnerability to&#13;
         shocks.&#13;
         Grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) are crucial for managing risk in the Bank â&#128;&#153;s portfolio. GRMs create opportunities to resolve disputes&#13;
         before they escalate by offering a channel for citizens to express concerns, comments, and complaints. Beyond their benefits to citizens,&#13;
         GRMs can help the Bank and clients improve project outcomes, prioritize supervision, identify systemic issues, and promote accountability.&#13;
G4-DMA&#13;
         The Bank promotes human rights principles through the projects it supports, for example, improving poor peopleâ&#128;&#153;s access to health&#13;
         services, education, food, and water. Moreover, the Bank promotes the participation of project-affected people, including Indigenous&#13;
         Peoples, in decision making and participation; helps strengthen the accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens; and&#13;
         supports justice reform and fighting corruption. Although development projects are intended to bring about positive change, their&#13;
         implementation involves risks, and people or the environment can be adversely impacted. The Bank has policies to help avoid such&#13;
         unintended outcomes, but some problems may remain unrecognized or unaddressed. In such circumstances, citizens must speak out to&#13;
         bring attention to these problems. This can be done either through project-level Grievance Redress Mechanisms or the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s corporate-&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                37&#13;
&amp;#12;          level Grievance Redress Service (GRS), which was established in January 2015 to field complaints that could not be addressed at the&#13;
          country level. This mechanism complements the borrowerâ&#128;&#153;s project level grievance mechanisms (where they exist), and the Boardâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
          Inspection Panel.&#13;
          The Environmental and Social Standards-Advisory Team (ESSAT) leads the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s corporate work on grievance redress. GRS provides a&#13;
          consistent and systematic approach to the handling of complaints and conflict resolution across all IBRD/IDA operations. The work involves&#13;
          a number of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s major initiatives, in particular, work on risk, results, and beneficiary feedback.&#13;
          The Global Review of Grievance Redress Mechanisms found that half of all Bank projects featured a GRM in project-design documents.&#13;
          However, new research shows implementation challenges.&#13;
          A major focus for the Bank in the future will be to further integrate grievance redress in all projects, increase support for implementation,&#13;
          and enhance collection and monitoring of grievances received and resolved across the projectsâ&#128;&#153; portfolios.&#13;

          The World Bank is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world. We are not a bank in the&#13;
          ordinary sense, but a unique partnership to reduce poverty and support development. We support a wide array of investments in such&#13;
          areas as education, health, public administration, infrastructure, financial and private sector development, agriculture, and environmental&#13;
          and natural resource management. Bank stakeholders look to the institution, as a lending facility, to have policies and procedures in place&#13;
          that assess and screen environmental and social risks in its lending portfolio.&#13;
&#13;
G4-DMA    In 2013, the World Bank adopted a new World Bank Group Strategy focused on aligning all of the institutionsâ&#128;&#153; work with the twin goals of&#13;
          eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The two goals are now at the heart of the World Bank&#13;
          Groupâ&#128;&#153;s work. A newly developed World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard is monitoring implementation and aggregating the contributions&#13;
          of all the World Bank Group institutions.&#13;
          On a day-to-day basis, in close partnership with country government counterparts and their stakeholders, Bank staff members shape the&#13;
          role, financial products, and technical and advisory services to the unique development needs and capacities of each country client. Thus,&#13;
          interactions with clients, investees, and business partners regarding environmental and social risks and opportunities form the foundation of&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                       38&#13;
&amp;#12;      the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s advisory and loan services. The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s environmental and social safeguard policies are the cornerstones of the financial,&#13;
      technical, and advisory services; they are applied to prevent and mitigate impacts and risks to people and their environment in the&#13;
      development process. There are 10 safeguard policies: Environmental Assessment, natural habitats, forests, pest management, physical&#13;
      cultural resources, dam safety, Indigenous Peoples, involuntary resettlement, international waterways, and disputed areas. Without these&#13;
      safeguards, the positive effects of the development work can be severely diminished. These policies provide mandatory guidelines for Bank&#13;
      and borrower staffs in the identification, preparation, and implementation of investment programs and projects. The World Bank is currently&#13;
      in the process of reviewing, updating, and strengthening its environmental and social safeguards for the projects it finances. This review is&#13;
      currently in its third phase. For more information, see http://consultations.worldbank.org/consultation/review-and-update-world-bank-&#13;

                                  The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s environmental and social safeguard policies are a cornerstone of the&#13;
                                  institutionâ&#128;&#153;s support to sustainable development and poverty reduction. There are 10&#13;

                                  policies have often provided a platform for the participation of stakeholders in project&#13;
                                  design, and have been an important instruments for building ownership among local&#13;
                                  populations. All safeguard policies are approved by the Board of Directors.&#13;

      lines                      potential environmental impacts. The borrower is responsible for any assessment&#13;
                                 required by the safeguard policies, with general advice provided by Bank staff.&#13;
                                 In general, a World Bank environmental and social specialist is assigned to each project&#13;
                                 with the potential to have environmental and social impact or risk in its design and&#13;
                                 planning stage. A sector manager who is responsible for a collection of projects, most&#13;
                                 often in sector and regional associations, oversees this process.&#13;
                                 As the project moves through design, the Bank works with the clients to understand the&#13;
                                 technical features of each project and, in partnership with borrowers, works to develop&#13;
                                 approaches for addressing these impacts as risks as required in the suite of World Bank&#13;
                                 safeguards policies. For category A and B projects, there is also involvement by the&#13;
                                 Regional Safeguard Advisor and his or her team or unit. Higher-risk projects must&#13;
                                 submit a series of â&#128;&#156;safeguard documentsâ&#128;&#157; to identify and explain how the borrower will&#13;
                                 undertake safeguard requirements. Several quality-control and review committees, such&#13;
                                 as the Regional Operational Committee (ROC), meet to agree on processes. Finally, the&#13;
                                 Board of Directors must approve all projects. Those approvals also require submission&#13;
                                 or summaries of any environmental assessment and social safeguards documents.&#13;
                                 Information is shared with all decision makers and stakeholders.&#13;
                                 These thresholds are based on environmental and social impact and risk defined in the&#13;
                                 safeguards policies and the Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines.&#13;

      social requirements        a year, or more frequently as determined on a project-specific basis, and include staff&#13;
      included in agreements     with appropriate environmental and social expertise. For more complex projects, staff&#13;
      or transactions            members from the regional safeguards units are included. The Bank â&#128;&#153;s Operations Risk&#13;

                              safeguards are applied in a uniform manner across regions. Environmental and social&#13;
                              management frameworks include provisions for grievance mechanisms by which&#13;
                              stakeholders can bring concerns forward and settle arising disputes. In addition,&#13;
                              stakeholders can bring concerns to the independent Inspection Panel, a permanent&#13;
                              body reporting to the Board of Executive Directors, to ensure accountability of the World&#13;
                              Bank and investigate complaints about harm stemming from policy violations.&#13;
                              Most often, Bank environmental and social specialists work with the project Task Team&#13;
                              and borrowers to identify noncompliance issues and provide suggestions and&#13;
                              procedures for bringing projects into compliance. Remedies are also available as&#13;
                              needed.&#13;
                              During project supervision, both environmental and social specialists undertake project&#13;
                              site visits and consult with numerous stakeholders. When safeguard issues of concern&#13;
                              are encountered, the Bank engages in discussions with the borrower to arrive at&#13;
                              mutually agreed courses of action that are both time bound and identify responsible&#13;
                              parties. These actions are documented in the Aide Memoire and regularly in technical&#13;

      Processes for           applying safeguard policies and each regional vice presidency offers trainings on&#13;
      improving staff         safeguard policies. In addition, an accreditation course has been established for&#13;
      competency to           environment specialists advising teams on environmental safeguards during project&#13;
      implement the           preparation and supervision. The purpose of accreditation is to ensure that the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

                                  Both the safeguards anchor and the regional safeguards advisors track the status of&#13;
                                  safeguards applications across their respective portfolios. When particular safeguards&#13;
                                  issues of concern appear common, there can be a special safeguards review, an&#13;
                                  assessment of desk review. In certain cases, one or several environmental and social&#13;
                                  safeguards specialists undertake a country visit and conduct site visits with safeguards&#13;
                                  training to help improve safeguards implementation or to correct past shortcomings.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                  When needed, there are formal face-to-face workshops, project implementation&#13;
                                  safeguards training in the field with project stakeholders, consultations by lead&#13;
                                  safeguards specialists, and rapid-response project visits to deal with high-risk issues of&#13;

         Two entities hold responsibilities for assessing and monitoring the Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s effectiveness:&#13;
         The Internal Audit Vice Presidency (IAD) has an independent and objective assurance advisory function designed to add value by&#13;
         assessing whether governance, risk management, and control processes of the Bank Group are effective in achieving the organizationâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
         goals. IAD also provides advice to management in developing control solutions, and monitors the implementation of management actions&#13;
         to mitigate risks and strengthen controls.&#13;
G4-DMA&#13;
         The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) is responsible for appraising the WBG operations self-evaluation and development risk-&#13;
         management systems, and attesting to their adequacy to the Board of Executive Directors. To this end, IEG periodically reviews the&#13;
         relevance, effectiveness, and efficacy of key operational policies, such as the environmental and social safeguards framework for WBG&#13;
         lending. For more information, see IEGâ&#128;&#153;s website: http://ieg.worldbank.org.&#13;

         The World Bank values the diversity, health, safety, and security of its 12,000 full-time staff and 4,000 short-term consultants, who work in&#13;
         Washington, DC, and in 136 countries worldwide. The institutionâ&#128;&#153;s diverse workforce brings a wide range of perspectives to bear on&#13;
         poverty-reduction issues and emerging development challenges. It is critical to the effectiveness of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s core operational and&#13;
         knowledge services. Our staff diversity is a strategic business asset that directly contributes to achievement of our two goals: reducing&#13;
         extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.&#13;
         To that end, it is important that the Bank employs the right people in the right place with the right skills at the right time. To deliver on that&#13;
G4-DMA   commitment, HR Strategy has five critical components: (1) building a culture of performance and accountability, (2) driving a more effective&#13;
         organization, (3) fostering a more diverse and inclusive workforce, (4) creating career opportunities, and (5) ensuring HR excellence and&#13;
         business-driven delivery.&#13;
         As the Bank retools to increase its delivery and responsiveness to its clients, Human Resources has played a pivotal role in the transition of&#13;
         staff from the earlier structure to the new Global Practices. Looking forward, the Bank will continue to make aligning staffing and skills to&#13;
         the World Bank Group Strategy a priority.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                     To recruit and retain highly qualified staff, the World Bank has developed a&#13;
                                     compensation and benefits system designed to be internationally competitive, to reward&#13;
                                     performance, and to take into account the special needs of a multinational and largely&#13;
         Ratios of standard entry    expatriate staff. The Executive Directors annually review the staff salary structure and, if&#13;
         level wage by gender        warranted, the salary structure is adjusted on the basis of a comparison with salaries&#13;
         compared to local           paid by private financial and industrial firms and by representative public sector&#13;
G4-EC5                                                                                                                                  Partial&#13;
         minimum wage at             agencies in the US market. The salary structure is reported according to job position for&#13;
         significant locations of    Washington, DC, staff, which comprises more than 60 percent of total staff. Salary&#13;
         operation                   structure is not disclosed according to gender. Remuneration of executive management,&#13;

         Energy is a key input to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s business operations. Through investor questionnaires, stakeholders have identified e nergy as an&#13;
         important aspect for the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s business. The purchase and use of energy can have various impacts because of the extraction of materials&#13;
         from the earthâ&#128;&#153;s crust and the production of persistent toxic emissions from the combustion of fuels. Combustion of fossil fu els can have&#13;
         severe health impacts on people. Moreover, the purchase and use of energy affects the expense-to-business revenue ratio. The World&#13;
G4-DMA   Bank manages its energy use carefully by tracking use in each owned facility on a monthly basis. Quarterly tracking of the Ba nkâ&#128;&#153;s energy&#13;
         use is evaluated by the Director of General Services. This metric is part of the Corporate Real Estate managerâ&#128;&#153;s performance objectives.&#13;
         Energy use is evaluated both as an absolute figure as well as on an intensity basis to determine progress.&#13;

                                   of 519,589 GJ, the Bank used 420,951 GJ in electricity; 5,817 GJ in steam; 28 GJ in&#13;
                                   cooling; and 18,704 GJ in heating, including natural gas and propane. The remainder&#13;
                                   was from diesel and other fuel consumption for energy generation. The World Bank&#13;
                                   does not sell any electricity, heating, cooling, or steam.&#13;

                                      In fiscal 2014, the Bank reduced its energy consumption by 28,583 GJ.&#13;
                                      In the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s main headquarters building, savings from the replacement of the legacy&#13;
                                      central chiller plant began to be realized, resulting in a reduction of energy consumption&#13;

         Addressing climate change is part of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s core mission of helping countries end extreme p overty and boosting shared&#13;
         prosperity. Climate change threatens to erode development gains around the worldâ&#128;&#148;and its effects will be greatest on the poorest and&#13;
         most vulnerable countries, which are the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s clients.&#13;
G4-DMA   As a demonstration of its corporate commitment to addressing climate change, the Bank continues to deepen its efforts to measure,&#13;
         reduce, offset, and report its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with its global internal operations, including its facilities, key&#13;
         meetings, and corporate air travel. The Bank has measured the GHG emissions from its facilities in Washington, DC, since 2005 and&#13;
         globally since 2007. Emissions data are collected and emissions are calculated in accordance with the World Resources Institute and&#13;
         World Business Council for Sustainable Developmentâ&#128;&#153;s GHG Protocol, with additional information on proxies, emissions factors, and the&#13;
                                                                                                                                                  48&#13;

                                 The World Bank measures GHG emissions intensity in two distinct categories. Scope 1&#13;
                                 and Scope 2 emissions are normalized per square meter, while Scope 3 emissions,&#13;
                                 mostly pertaining to employee air travel, are normalized per full-time (employee)&#13;

                                 was still greater than the 2010 base-year emissions of 0.107 mtCO2e/sqm.&#13;
                                 Scope 3 emissions per FTE also decreased, from 9.5 in fiscal 2013 to 8.24&#13;

                                      Estimated reduction in CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from Scope 2 activities totaled 500&#13;
                                      metric tons including the projects listed below. Reduction reporting is based on major&#13;
                                      initiatives taken in fiscal 2015 as related to achieving reductions from the fiscal 2010&#13;
                                      base year. Fiscal 2010 was chosen as the base year because it was the first year that&#13;
                                      confidence for data related to emissions from Country Offices was high.&#13;
                                      In fiscal 2015, savings continued to be realized from the optimization of the central&#13;

          emissions                   changes resulted in additional savings of 133 metric tons of CO2e, based on utility bills.&#13;
                                      In the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Chennai, India, office, variable frequency drives were installed in the&#13;
                                      majority of the HVAC system, and LED fixtures were installed throughout the building,&#13;
                                      resulting in modeled savings of 282 metric tons of CO2e.&#13;
                                      Methodologies and assumptions for calculating reductions are based on initiative&#13;
                                      proposals for each reduction project.&#13;

          Emissions of ozone-&#13;
G4-EN20   depleting substances        The World Bank does not produce, import, or export any ozone-depleting substances.                  Full&#13;
          (ODS)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          The World Bank views reducing effluent and waste production as a material aspect because of the potential negative environmental&#13;
          impacts, which include the release of persistent toxic chemicals through waste disposed of in landfills or by being incinerated. Bank&#13;
G4-DMA    stakeholders also consider reducing the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s effluent and waste production important.&#13;
          The Bank has worked to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills through a combination of source reduction, reuse, and recycling.&#13;
          Minimizing the amount of material brought into Bank facilities is the first way it manages the amount of waste created. Avoiding&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                  51&#13;
&amp;#12;          unnecessary packaging for purchased items, including encouraging minimum purchase thresholds for office supplies, is one way the Bank&#13;
          accomplishes this. Another way is by mandating that large purchases from vendors, such as the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s latest computer monitor purchase,&#13;
          be delivered in bulk instead of individually packaged. In fiscal 2015, the Bank continued to pursue efficiencies in the standardization of&#13;
          waste management in its headquarters facilities. The concentration in 2015 was on the waste being created in the cafeterias. Through work&#13;
          with the food services vendor, the Bank was able to standardize waste bins with labels, mount posters in the kitchens, and provide training&#13;
          to cafeteria staff. The Bank set a goal of 80 percent diversion of waste from landfills from the back-of-the-house cafeteria operations. In the&#13;
          most recent audit, conducted in summer 2015, the average diversion rate was 78 percent for all cafeterias, showing much progress from a&#13;
          baseline of 54 percent in fiscal 2014 and the potential to divert as much as 89 percent in fiscal 2016.&#13;
          There are no related adjustments to the management approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       The Bank has worked to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills through a&#13;
                                       combination of source reduction, reuse, and recycling. See the discussion about&#13;
                                       sustainable facilities for details. No hazardous waste is generated by the World Bank.&#13;
                                       Total nonhazardous waste produced by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Washington, DC, offices in fiscal&#13;
                                       2015 was 1,959 metric tons, a slight increase from 1,913 metric tons in fiscal 2013. In&#13;
          Total weight of waste by     fiscal 2015, 858 tons of waste were sent to a landfill, whereas 930 tons of waste were&#13;
G4-EN23   type and disposal            recycled, which includes paper, bottles and cans, cardboard, toner cartridges, carpet                 Full&#13;

                                       The information is provided by the waste-disposal contractor and the electronic- waste&#13;
                                       recycler, subcontracted through the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s PC provider. Weights from roll-off&#13;
                                       compactors used for landfilled waste and recycling are exact weights to the closest one&#13;
                                       tenth of a ton. Proxies for estimating composting weight from trash cans are not&#13;

                                    communicates with staff, clients, and partners regarding these concerns. The Program&#13;
                                    has an annual budget of $560,000.&#13;
                                    In addition, the Bank offsets its emissions in two different ways. It purchases Renewable&#13;
                                    Energy Certificates (RECs) in equal amounts (MWh) to the electricity it consumes&#13;
                                    globally. In addition, the Bank offsets other emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 3) through&#13;
                                    the purchase of Verified Emissions Reductions (VERs). In fiscal 2015, the Bank&#13;
                                    maintained carbon neutrality by the purchase of credits totaling nearly $200,000 from a&#13;
                                    portfolio of projects, including a Gold Standard efficient cook stove project and small-&#13;
                                    scale hydropower project, both in Uganda, and energy-efficiency and wind power&#13;
                                    projects in India. An additional $325,000 was spent on emissions reduction efforts in&#13;
                                    country offices. Efforts in fiscal 2015 included upgrading lighting to LEDs in many&#13;
                                    buildings, installing solar panels on the Islamabad office, and using more variable&#13;

         The aim of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s investment in staff learning is to ensure that learning is a strategic tool for the organization, so that staff members&#13;
         have the cutting-edge knowledge and skills to carry out the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s mission. In April 2010, Bank senior management endorsed the Staff&#13;
         Learning Strategy, which outlines three complementary and mutually reinforcing pillars: Corporate Core Curriculum (includes onboarding&#13;
G4-DMA   of new staff, operational learning, and management and leadership development), Professional and Technical Learning, and Unit and&#13;
         Individual Learning (such as languages for business purposes, mentoring, and behavioral skills.). Cross-cutting principles underpinning&#13;
         the Learning Strategy are ensuring geographically neutral access to learning, more on-the-job learning and less formal classroom&#13;
         learning, common quality-assurance processes, and linkage with competencies. The Bank offers a broad range of learning resources via&#13;
         online and face-to-face sessions through its internal learning program. Funding support for external training or education is made possible&#13;
         based on annual discussions between staff and managers about individual yearly learning plans.&#13;

                                     days). Thirty-nine of the training days were delivered either in Country Offices or&#13;

         World Bank staff are located in offices in 127 countries and work in core finance, administrative, legal, economics, and technical&#13;
         specializations in more than 20 sectors. Staff contribute an impressive breadth and depth of professional expertise, academic background,&#13;
         industry, and international experience. The World Bank recognizes that meeting the demands and needs of its diverse client base more&#13;
         effectively means the Bank must consider a range of ideas and perspectives to find the best solution to development challenges. Achieving&#13;
         shared prosperity in a sustainable way is, by definition, about equal opportunity, empowerment, and economic and social inclusion.&#13;
         The Articles of Agreement for IBRD and IDA emphasize the need to â&#128;&#156;pay due regard to the importance of recruiting personnel on as wide a&#13;
         geographical basis as possibleâ&#128;&#157; when appointing Bank officers and staff, â&#128;&#156;subject to the paramount importance of securing the highest&#13;
         standards of efficiency and of technical competence.â&#128;&#157; This directive was reiterated in the 1983 Principles of Staff Employment, approved by&#13;
         the Executive Directors, to set forth the broad policies according to which the President shall manage staff. In addition, the principles direct&#13;
         the Bank to â&#128;&#156;encourage diversity in staffing consistent with the nature and objectives of the Organizations.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
G4-DMA   In addition to reflecting the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s global nature, the importance of staff diversity in enhancing the effectiveness an d credibility of the&#13;
         Bankâ&#128;&#153;s institutions has been underscored by ongoing reforms to increase the voice and participation of emerging markets and developing&#13;
         countries at the Bank. It is incumbent upon the Bank to consider how to organize and manage people internally as it works with our&#13;
         partners to help countries achieve gender equality as a pathway to ensuring lasting poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The World&#13;
         Bank mission statement describes the work environment the Bank strives to maintain: â&#128;&#156;an excellent institution able to attract, excite, and&#13;
         nurture diverse and committed staff with exceptional skills, who know how to listen and learn,â&#128;&#157; underpinned by the core values of working&#13;
         together in teams, with openness and trust, empowering others, and respecting differences.&#13;
         Consistently in staff surveys, a large majority of staff agree that they work in a climate in which diverse perspectives are valued, where we&#13;
         treat each other with dignity and respect, and where colleagues are treated fairly regardless of gender, age, race/ethnicity, national origin,&#13;
         native language, religion, disability, and sexual orientation. Staff are drawn to and energized by the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s dynamic multicultural&#13;

                                   42 percent of staff in management positions. Women accounted for 38 percent of staff in&#13;
                                   management positions, and for 43 percent of full-time staff at professional grades (grade&#13;

                                   represent 12 percent of full-time staff at professional grades (grade GF+).&#13;
                                   Since 1998, nationality, gender, and race have been the dimensions of diversity for&#13;
                                   which the Bank has set and monitored quantitative targets. Nationality has been&#13;
           Breakdown of            measured in the aggregate by Part I and II contributing member status (roughly&#13;
           employees per           equivalent to developed and developing countries, respectively), whereas SSA and CR&#13;
           employee category       nationality has served as the proxy for race.&#13;

&amp;#12;          The Bank considers the diversity of its staff a strategic business asset. Due to its immunities from most national courts, the Bank Group&#13;
          provides staff with comprehensive Internal Justice Services to resolve and provide redress of staff's issues and grievances using informal&#13;
          and formal mechanisms. These services increase the level of collaboration among staff, provide spaces for the effective management of&#13;
          conflicts, and increase the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s capacity to build and retain a globally representative workforce that has a voice and is valued by the&#13;
          organization.&#13;
          Most staff's concerns are handled by one of the informal services of Internal Justice: Respectful Workplace Advisors, Ombuds Services,&#13;
G4-DMA    and Mediation Services. Use of these mechanisms is voluntary, and staff also have direct access to the systemâ&#128;&#153;s formal grievance&#13;
          mechanisms of Peer Review Services (PRS), the Business Ethics and Conduct (EBC) Vice Presidency, and the Integrity (INT) Vice&#13;
          Presidency. EBC investigates allegations of staff misconduct, and INT investigates allegations of fraud and corruption committed by&#13;
          individuals and companies involved in Bank-supported projects, as well as allegations against internal staff. PRS considers whether the&#13;
          World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s actions are consistent with the staff memberâ&#128;&#153;s contract of employment and/or terms of appointment, including the&#13;
          pertinent Bank Group rules and policies. If these internal grievance mechanisms are exhausted, staff can access the World Bank&#13;
          Administrative Tribunal (WBAT), which is the independent judicial forum of last resort for the resolution of cases submitted by staff alleging&#13;
          non-observance of their contracts of employment or terms of appointment. WBATâ&#128;&#153;s decisions are final and binding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       In fiscal 2015, there was an increase in staff using Internal Justice Services, mostly&#13;
                                       informal services provided by the Respectful Workplace Advisors, Ombuds, and&#13;
                                       Mediation. The combined caseload of these services grew to 1,617 cases in fiscal 2015,&#13;
                                       an 18 percent increase over fiscal 2014. Peer Review cases also grew from 50 to 54,&#13;
          Number of grievances         and the WBAT caseload increased from 20 to 28. A concerted outreach effort to staff in&#13;
          about labor practices        Country Offices has resulted in more field-based staff using the Internal Justice&#13;
G4-LA16   filed, addressed, and        Services.                                                                                             Full&#13;
          resolved through formal&#13;
          grievance mechanisms         In fiscal 2015, Peer Review Services opened 54 cases, EBC 297 cases, INT 32 cases,&#13;
                                       and the World Bank Administrative Tribunal 28 cases. A large majority of grievances&#13;
                                       opened during fiscal 2015 were closed in the same fiscal year. Seventeen PRS cases&#13;
                                       filed in fiscal 2014 that were resolved in fiscal 2015 for PRS, as were 44 for EBC, 11 for&#13;
                                       INT, and 15 for WBAT.&#13;

&amp;#12;          The World Bank considers the diversity of its staff a strategic business asset. The World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Code of Conduct defines&#13;
         discrimination as â&#128;&#156;the unjustifiable differentiation between individuals or groups within staff. Discrimination can be based on characteristics&#13;
         such as race, color, gender, language, physical ability, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, or sexual orientation.â&#128;&#157; The&#13;
         Code of Conduct stipulates that each individual has a role to play in preventing discrimination in the workplace.&#13;
         The World Bank Group Office of Ethics and Business Conduct (EBC) promotes high ethical standards by staff members in the performance&#13;
G4-DMA   of their duties. It ensures staff understand their ethical obligations to the World Bank as embodied in its core values and the terms under&#13;
         which they operate. The office is accessible to all staff members and their families.&#13;
         The Ethics Helpline (ethics_helpline@worldbank.org, 800-261-7497) can be contacted anonymously 24/7. In addition, the Integrity (INT)&#13;
         Vice Presidency advises operational staff on preventing fraud and corruption in Bank-supported projects. Stakeholders can report&#13;
         allegations via the INT hotline (investigations_hotline@worldbank.org, 800-831-0463).&#13;

            This 2015 index of sustainability
            indicators has been prepared in accordance with the
            internationally recognized standard for sustainability
            reporting Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and
            complies with the ‘core option.’ The GRI Index provides an
            overview of sustainability considerations within the World
            Bank’s lending and analytical services as well as its
            day-to-day operations and management of staff. The World
            Bank aims to be comprehensive in its reporting and thus the
            Index includes indicators from GRI's financial sector
            supplement.  The GRI Index covers activities from fiscal
            2015, July 1, 2014, through June 30, 2015.
