influenced the official position of the Federal&#13;
Government during both the CET and EPA negotiations.&#13;
Nigeria has long had a more inward-looking trade policy&#13;
than most of its neighbors, even with regards to&#13;
intraregional trade. A variety of trade restrictive&#13;
instruments, such as high tariffs, special levies, and import&#13;
bans, have been used to protect domestic industries with&#13;
limited efficiency but damageable side effects (World&#13;
Bank 2010, Treichel et al. 2012). In the meantime,&#13;
groups that would likely favor and benefit from a more&#13;
liberal trade policy stance (e.g. consumers, traders,&#13;
producers importing inputs, customs officials) are less&#13;
organized and have carried less weight in these politically&#13;
sensitive debates. Studies predicting dire impacts of the&#13;
EPA on public revenue, employment and industrial&#13;
output have been cited in recent years and used to argue&#13;
that Nigeria should not sign the EPA. However, some of&#13;
these studies have not been published, making it hard to&#13;
evaluate the quality of the methodologies and data used,&#13;
and thus to assess the accuracy of their results.&#13;

products, food and beverages, leather products, textiles,&#13;
tobacco), implying that producers in these sectors would gain     3&#13;

&#13;
                                                                  2&#13;
&amp;#12;                                     Box 1: The ECOWAS Common External Tariff&#13;
The establishment of a customs union through the introduction of a CET was planned in the original ECOWAS Treaty of 1975&#13;
and Revised Treaty of 1993, but successive deadlines for its adoption were repeatedly postponed during the 2000s due to the&#13;
limited progress of negotiations.&#13;
In 1997, the eight ECOWAS countries part of the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) adopted a CET&#13;
structured along four tariff bands of 0% (essential social goods), 5% (goods of primary necessity, raw materials and specific inputs),&#13;
10 % (intermediary products) and 20% (final consumption products). The double objective of this structure was to promote local&#13;
value addition while applying low duties on essential goods. This tariff came into effect on January 1st, 2000, though some&#13;
divergences remain between national tariffs of WAEMU countries .     4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The decision to align the ECOWAS CET to the one adopted at WAEMU level was confirmed by Heads of States at the Niamey&#13;
summit of January 2006, which adopted a similar four-band tariff and agreed that all non-WAEMU countries would transition to&#13;
this tariff by end-2008 . However, pressures from certain countries, notably Nigeria, resulted in 2009 in the revision of the TEC to&#13;
                       5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
provide additional protection for 130 â&#128;&#156;specific goods for economic developmentâ&#128;? through a fifth tariff band, initially proposed at&#13;
50% but revised at 35%. In subsequent years, intense technical and political negotiations took place, notably to determine the&#13;
appropriate tariff band for each product based on different countries and stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; priorities to protect domestic producers or&#13;
maintain low consumer prices.&#13;
A consensus was eventually reached for the final structure of the CET, which was endorsed by ECOWAS Heads of States in Dakar&#13;
in October 2013 and set to come into force on January 1st, 2015. In addition to customs duties, the CET comprises two&#13;
Supplementary Protection Measures (SPMs), namely the temporary Import Adjustment Tax (IAT) and the safeguard&#13;
Supplementary Protection Tax (SPT). During a five-year transition period, member States are granted the flexibility to deviate from&#13;
the CET for a maximum of 3% of tariff lines and a maximum total tax rate (customs duty, IAT and SPT) of 70%.&#13;
The adoption of the ECOWAS CET has shifted the focus on its implementation from 2015. Regional meetings in end-2014&#13;
confirmed that the region was ready to start applying the CET but acknowledged that significant implementation challenges will be&#13;
faced, at least initially. Outstanding issues include: (i) the clarification of the application modalities of SPMs, (ii) the development of&#13;
a community customs code (iii) possible renegotiations at the WTO for some ECOWAS countries and products for which CET&#13;
rates will exceed WTO-bound rates, (iv) the establishment a sound regional mechanism to monitor the effective implementation by&#13;
all countries of the CET and compliance with SPM application rules, (v) the removal of policy barriers to intra-regional trade and&#13;
improvement of the ECOWAS Trade Liberalization Scheme (ETLS), and (vi) the eventual elaboration of a common ECOWAS&#13;
trade policy.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;

 More than a decade after the entry into force of the WAEMU CET, national tariffs have not all been aligned, additional taxes not&#13;
planned by the CET continue to be applied, and the temporary Taxe DÃ©gressive de Protection continues to be applied by certain&#13;
countries when it should have been phased out by end-2006 (UEMOA 2014).&#13;
5&#13;
 In 2005, Nigeria undertook a major reform of its tariff structure to simplify it and partially align it with the proposed ECOWAS&#13;
CET, although an additional 50% band was introduced. While this reform reduced the average level of tariff protection, it did not&#13;
remove import bans and increased levies on a number of products, maintaining their overall level of protection (Nielsen and&#13;
Zouhon-Bi (2007).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                         3&#13;
&amp;#12;                            Box 2: The ECOWAS-EU Economic Partnership Agreement&#13;
Negotiations of EPAs between the EU and regional groupings of ACP countries, including West Africa, started in 2002 and were&#13;
                                                                                                            6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
initially planned to be completed by 2008. The main objectives advanced by the EU to justify the need for EPAs were to (i) comply&#13;
with WTO requirement for reciprocity in trade agreements (as opposed to previous unilateral preferential agreements which&#13;
discriminated against non-ACP developing countries), (ii) promote ACP countriesâ&#128;&#153; trade, development and insertion in the global&#13;
economy, and (iii) advance regional integration.&#13;
One complexity of the EPA negotiations in West Africa has stemmed from the diverse economic structures and interests of&#13;
ECOWAS countries. LDCs, which represent the majority of these countries, are eligible to duty-free quota-free (DFQF) access to&#13;
the European market under the Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme, and would in theory not lose access should no EPA be&#13;
signed . Non-LDCs in the region would stand to lose more without an EPA, which pushed Ghana and Cote dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire to negotiate an&#13;
      7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;interim EPAâ&#128;? with the EU in 2007. This has undermined the position of the ECOWAS as a single negotiating block and the&#13;
prospects for an ECOWAS common market, although the interim agreements have not been ratified. As Cotonou Agreement&#13;
preferences expired in end-2007, the EU temporarily granted DFQF market access to ACP countries having engaged EPA&#13;
negotiations under the Market Access Regulation (MAR). The others reverted to the less favorable GSP (Nigeria), an enhanced&#13;
â&#128;&#156;GSP+â&#128;? (Cabo Verde) or the EBA in the case of LDCs.&#13;
EPA negotiations stretched over more than a decade, increasing tensions between the two parties and within the West African&#13;
group. Some of the main stumbling blocks concerned the extent and timeline of West Africaâ&#128;&#153;s market access offer, as w ell as the&#13;
amount of the â&#128;&#156;EPA Development Programâ&#128;? (PAPED in French) meant to help West African countries cope with adjustment&#13;
costs. In order to speed up negotiations, the European Commission announced in September 2011 that the temporary MAR&#13;
treatment would end for ACP countries who failed to conclude an EPA by October 2014. A compromise was subsequently found&#13;
by Chief Negotiators of the two parties in February 2014 and, after some revisions requested by Nigeria and other countries, West&#13;
African Heads of States eventually endorsed the agreement in July 2014. However, opposition to the EPA by some Nigerian&#13;
stakeholders has remained strong and the willingness of the Federal Government to sign it is still unclear, maintaining uncertainty&#13;
regarding the future of the agreement.&#13;
Under the negotiated agreement, the EU will fully open its market to West African products from the first day of entry into force,&#13;
while West African countries will gradually remove tariffs on imports from the EU for 75% of ECOWAS CET tariff lines, over a&#13;
20-year transition period and at various speeds for different categories of products. The remaining 25% of goods for which&#13;
ECOWAS countries wish to protect existing or potential producers will not see tariffs reduced. Moreover, trade defense measures&#13;
are included to protect West African countries from the risk of sudden and excessive increase in imports of liberalized products&#13;
from the EU, including in infant industries. The more flexible rules of origin will allow West African producers to export duty-free&#13;
products made with inputs from third countries. Finally, an amount of 6.5 billion euros has been pledged by the EU for the&#13;
PAPED during the period 2015-2019.&#13;
The negotiated EPA is a traditional trade agreement, in the sense that it only covers goods and largely focuses on tariff reductions,&#13;
although many African countries have only seen a weak supply response to such trade preferences in the past. However, the initial&#13;
objective of the EPAs was to establish more comprehensive development frameworks by supporting domestic and regional reforms&#13;
that address deeper supply-side constraints to competitiveness, including both tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, access and costs&#13;
of backbone services, trade facilitation and regional integration, etc. (Brenton et al. 2008). While further EPA negotiations between&#13;
West Africa and the EU are expected on issues such as services, competition and investment, no clear timeline has been established&#13;
so far. The possibility to complement the EPA to cover a broader set of issues related to domestic competiveness will arguably&#13;
determine its impact on trade, regional integration and development in the future.&#13;

 The West Africa-EU EPA is negotiated by the 15 ECOWAS countries plus Mauritania.&#13;
7&#13;
 It has been argued that the EPAâ&#128;&#153;s more flexible rules of origin and binding nature would make DFQF market access both easier to&#13;
use and more predictable for LDCs, and would thus be more interesting for them than EBA status. Moreover, LDCs interest is to&#13;
graduate from this status, which implies losing EBA eligibility.&#13;

Conclusions                                                 largely determine the benefits that countries, firms and&#13;
                                                            workers can expect from them, including in Nigeria.&#13;

            ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CET) and Economic Partnership
            Agreement (EPA) will outweigh costs in Nigeria, but
            competitiveness is the real issue.  After decade-long
            negotiations, the ECOWAS CET and EPA with the EU recently
            reached decisive milestones. These major reforms should have
            significant impacts and offer new opportunities to West
            Africa, but have so far failed to garner a broad consensus,
            notably in Nigeria. The lack of objective and easily
            accessible assessments of their likely effects appears to be
            partly responsible for this situation. Two recent World Bank
            studies use a simple methodology to assess the potential
            impact of these reforms on Nigeria. Overall, full
            implementation of the CET and EPA in Nigeria would result in
            limited fiscal losses, marginal welfare gains for consumers
            and higher profits for a majority of manufacturing firms
            accounting for the majority of jobs in this sector. Almost
            all firms experiencing negative effects exhibit
            higher-than-average profitability before the reforms and
            most would remain profitable after them. The predicted
            magnitude of both the CET and EPA is small compared to gains
            that could be achieved by tackling supply-side constraints
            faced by Nigerian firms. Combining trade policy reforms with
            an ambitious competitiveness agenda that addresses the most
            binding constraints and promotes regional trade appears as
            the best way to maximize the benefits and minimize the
            potential cost of these reforms.
