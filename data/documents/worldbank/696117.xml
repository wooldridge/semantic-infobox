STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
PILOT WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A. Background: General&#13;
1.    At the meeting of the Heads of Governments of the five Aral Sea states, which met in January&#13;
1994, it was decided to include the Kazakstan Water Supply, Sanitation, and Health Project in the Aral&#13;
Sea Program. It also was decided that this project should be primarily aimed at providing short-term&#13;
solutions to the water, sanitation, and health conditions in the project area. The Project has since been&#13;
renamed the Kazakstan Aral Sea Community Rehabilitation Project&#13;
2&#13;
2.    With a total population of just over 17 million and a land area of 2,717,000 km , the Republic of&#13;
Kazakstan is the largest and richest of the Central Asian Republics. It extends across all of northern&#13;
Central Asia, from the Caspian Sea to the Chinese border. Kazakstan has made steady progress in its&#13;
transition to a market economy over the past three and a half years. In this process it is building on its&#13;
inherited strengths, which include rich endowments of natural resources, a highly educated work force,&#13;
and a sizable infrastructure base.&#13;
3.    Kazakstan faces some of the most daunting environmental problems in the world. The air, water&#13;
and soil pollution from industrial, urban and agricultural sources have had an adverse effect on the&#13;
environment in Kazakstan. Of particular significance for the country is the pollution of the northern&#13;
portion of the Aral Sea Basin, which lies in Kazakstan.&#13;
4.    At one time the world's fourth largest lake, the Aral Sea has for many years been drying up.&#13;
Much of the water from its two major feeder rivers, the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, has been diverted&#13;
for upstream agricultural use. The northern half of the Aral Sea, including the lower portion of the Syr&#13;
Darya, lies within Kazakstan's Kzyl-Orda Oblast. Extensive irrigation works, mainly for cotton growth&#13;
in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, and intensive agriculture over the past 30 years, with excessive use of&#13;
fertilizers and pesticides, have caused the pollution of groundwater, a reduction in agricultural yield, and&#13;
extensive salinization. Previously important local food crops (such as rice) can no longer be grown&#13;
effectively, which has resulted in a dramatic decline in economic activity. The most adversely affected&#13;
regions in Kazakstan are the Aralsk and Kazalinsk Rayons in the Kzyl-Orda Oblast.&#13;
B. Background: Aral Sea Disaster Region&#13;
5.    Population.   The Kzyl-Orda Oblast (provincial capital Kzyl-Orda) covers 228,000 km2 and&#13;
has a population of 598,000. It occupies the Syr Darya delta and the lower and middle parts of the Syr&#13;
Darya valley, and the northern and eastern shores of the Aral Sea lie within this province. Within the&#13;
Oblast, two Rayons, Aralsk and Kazalinsk, are immediately adjacent to the Aral Sea and are the most&#13;
adversely affected areas by the crisis. Between 1979 and 1989, the total population of the Aral Sea&#13;
region grew considerably. Kzyl-Orda's population increased by 15%, 2% more than the national average&#13;
of 13%. In 1989, the population of Aralsk and Kazalinsk Rayons were 70,804 and 71,651, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Recent demographic studies suggest, however, that the province's population increase has actually&#13;
decreased since 1989, due to out-migration: in 1993, the Oblast had a negative migration balance of&#13;
7,100.&#13;

6.    By January 1995, the Aralsk Rayon had a total population of 78,450, of whom about 40% lived&#13;
in the capital of Aralsk, and 60% in rural areas (38% in small rural settlements). The average family size&#13;
in Aralsk Rayon is 5.7 people. Kazalinsk Rayon had a total population of 74,120, of whom 42% live in&#13;
rural settlements. The average family size in Kazalinsk Rayon is 5.0 people. Overall, the dominant size&#13;
of rural settlements in Kzyl-Orda Oblast is 11-25 persons (22% of population, living mainly in small&#13;
family communities), and 500-2,000 persons (19% of population, living mainly on collective farms). The&#13;
average rural family in Kzyl-Orda Oblast has 6.3 members.&#13;
7.    Kzyl-Orda Oblast is not as ethnically diverse as Karakalpakstan, its southern neighbor in&#13;
Uzbekistan. Kazaks (79.4%) are clearly the most numerous ethnic group. Within the Oblast, Kazaks&#13;
inhabit the northern shores of the Aral Sea, as well as the Syr Darya delta and valley, accounting for 98%&#13;
of the population of the Rayons of Kazalinsk and Aralsk. They also constitute the sparse nomadic&#13;
population of the Asteroid and Kzylkum Deserts (in Kzyl-Orda and Karakalpakstan). The most&#13;
numerically important minorities are Russians (13.3%), Koreans (2%), and Ukrainians (2%). They&#13;
mainly live in the central and southern parts of the province, and around the city of Kzyl-Orda. However,&#13;
many Russians and Ukrainians have left the area since 1989, though no reliable data are available on&#13;
their numbers. It is also unclear to what extent these migration movements were motivated by the break-&#13;
up of the Soviet Union, as opposed to the deterioration of living conditions in the Aral Sea region.&#13;
8.    Socio-Economic Conditions. The Aral Sea crisis has resulted in very serious economic problems&#13;
in the area. The Aral Sea region includes some of the poorest Oblasts and Rayons of the Central Asian&#13;
countries, with per capita income in the early 1990s at 2-3 times below the average poverty level for&#13;
Central Asia. Economic losses in Kzyl-Orda Oblast in the past 30 years are estimated at US$3 billion,&#13;
mainly as a result of the decline in natural resources and subsequent loss of employment. Commercial&#13;
fishing and shipping in the Aral Sea was abandoned in the mid-1980s, while the Oblast's two major&#13;
factories (fish-processing, and pulp and paper) had to switch to more expensive, imported raw materials&#13;
for inputs, after the disappearance of local resources. Agricultural output in the Syr Darya delta and&#13;
valley declined by 20-30%, a direct result of soil salinization (saline soils, saline irrigation waters,&#13;
groundwater contamination, wind), climate changes, and reduced labor efficiency due to health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
problems. More and more chemicals were needed to maintain a certain output level, leading to economic&#13;
inefficiencies and a further ecological deterioration of arable land.&#13;
9.     Water Supply System. The water supply in Kazalinsk Rayon and parts of Aralsk Rayon depends&#13;
on the Syr Darya River and its system of irrigation canals, artesian groundwater, highly saline shallow&#13;
groundwater wells, and springs. Surface water from the Syr Darya River is partially treated in the&#13;
Kazalinsk Water Treatment Plant, designed for a capacity of 20,000 m3/day. Treatment consists of&#13;
filtration and chlorination. After treatment water is pumped into the distribution network of the cities of&#13;
Kazalinsk and Novokazalinsk.&#13;
10.   Artesian groundwater is extracted from two groups of wells, one group of 30 wells in the&#13;
Kosaman field, and another of 30 wells in the Berdykol field. These fields are located 110 km northwest&#13;
from the city of Aralsk. The total potential yield of both groups is 756 liters/second, but due to the large&#13;
number of non-operational wells (47% in Berdykol and 38% in Kosaman), the current discharge rate is&#13;
only 320 liters/second. A USAID-funded project, currently underway, aims to rehabilitate these wells&#13;
and bring their production capacity to 620 liters/second (53,568 m3/day).&#13;
11.   After chlorination, groundwater is pumped into reservoirs, from where it is repumped again into&#13;
the Aralsk-Sarbulak transmission pipeline, via 6 booster pump stations to the next downstream reservoir.&#13;
The total length of the pipeline is about 240 km, extending up to the city of Novokazalinsk. It delivers&#13;
water to the cities of Aralsk (with a total reservoir capacity of 32,000 m 3) and Kazalinsk, as well as&#13;
several rural settlements along the pipeline. Novokazalinsk is nominally connected to the pipeline, but it&#13;
does not benefit from it due to a lack of storage and pumping capacity.&#13;
12.   Theoretically, 73% of the population of Aralsk Rayon have access to water from the Aralsk-&#13;
Sarbulak pipeline, 13% depend on untreated water from the Syr Darya River, and 15% rely on saline&#13;
shallow groundwater, springs or irrigation canals. In reality, a much smaller percentage of the population&#13;
receives water from the pipeline, due to its poor construction and associated problems. In Kazalinsk&#13;
Rayon, only the city of Kazalinsk and four rural settlements (Kumzhiek, Basikara, Muratbayev, and&#13;
Zhalantos Batyr) are connected to the Aralsk-Sarbulak pipeline. Most of the population (80-85%) have to&#13;
rely on the Syr Darya River, irrigation canals, shallow groundwater, and springs.&#13;
13.   In the city of Aralsk, the water distribution system consists of 70 km of pipelines, 3,000 house&#13;
connections, and 54 public standpipes, of which only 21 are in working condition. The distribution&#13;
systems of the cities of Kazalinsk and Novokazalinsk consist of 15 km and 60 km of pipes, 70 and 2,030&#13;
house connections, and 70 and 30 public standpipes, respectively.&#13;
14.   Historically, the water supply and sanitation situation of the project area can be summarized into&#13;
three main phases:&#13;
(a)    prior to 1960, the semi-nomadic populations of the Kzyl-Orda Oblast enjoyed access to&#13;
safe drinking water, while the towns were able to use nearby springs and wells for their&#13;
needs.&#13;
(b)    Beginning of Aral Sea Disaster (1960 -1970). With the introduction of extensive large-&#13;
scale agricultural development, environmental degradation began to show associated&#13;
symptoms of desertification, such as salinization of the groundwater, the loss of the pasture&#13;
lands, forests, and sources of spring water. In the 1960s, while the Syr Darya's water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
quality was still good, water was taken from the river at a point close to the community.&#13;
The rapid deterioration in the river's water quality has forced the construction of a major&#13;
regional water supply scheme. However, the new scheme does not extend to all&#13;
communities. Those uncovered and those provided with an extremely unreliable system&#13;
still rely on the old, often unsafe, supply arrangements.&#13;
(c)    The Period of Special Attention by USSR (1980-1990). By the 1980s, the central Soviet&#13;
authorities and respective national Supreme Soviets passed various resolutions to give&#13;
priority to meeting the needs of the populations in the disaster area. The usual budget&#13;
allocations for Kzyl-Orda Oblast were trebled in the late 1980s in order to ameliorate with&#13;
substantial financial resources some of the area's short-term needs. By 1988, special&#13;
coefficients for salaries were introduced in order to raise incomes. During the same period,&#13;
the water supply was reconstructed or newly constructed for the city of Kzyl-Orda, five&#13;
Rayon centers, and 80 collective and state farms. These new or renovated systems relied on&#13;
groundwater, with some 260 new artesian wells installed and 365 km of water pipes&#13;
constructed for this purpose.&#13;
15.   Inadequate maintenance of the system, high levels of leakage, the rapid deterioration of water&#13;
quality from existing wells, and harsh climatic conditions have all contributed to the severe deterioration&#13;
of the existing piped water supply system. At the same time, many communities are still unserved,&#13;
except for the occasional delivery of water by truck. Treatment facilities are largely lacking, and the&#13;
pumping stations are either severely damaged or not functioning due to a shortage of spare parts. The&#13;
situation deteriorates even further in the winter months, when the water pipes freeze and the shortage of&#13;
gasoline, coupled with a lack of cash in the hands of the state farms and affected families, impede the&#13;
distribution of drinking water by truck and tractor.&#13;
16.    The productivity of operating agencies' labor appears to be very low. Productivity indices are as&#13;
follows: In Aralsk, 160 people served, 20 house connections, and 6,100m3 of water sold annually per&#13;
staff member; in Kazalinsk, 260 people served, 21 house connections, and 5,400m3 of water sold&#13;
annually per staff member.&#13;
17.    Operational efficiency is also low. The levels of water losses in the Aralsk-Sarbulak system are&#13;
reported to range from 45 to 70% of total production. The lack of meters at both production and intake&#13;
points hampers a full assessment of losses. Losses in the distribution network are reported to range from&#13;
40 to 50%.&#13;
18.    The existing water supply system, especially in rural areas and on state farms, is limited to&#13;
standpipes. People must queue in the streets, at taps placed about every 150m, in order to fill their&#13;
buckets. Because the supply is limited to about an hour a day (in accordance with Kazakstan's current&#13;
energy-saving policy), the amount of water each family can fetch is limited to a total of 100 liters, or 15&#13;
liters per person/day for drinking and cooking purposes only. This may be supplemented by well or river&#13;
water for bathing, cleaning, and laundry. The high salinity of groundwater (2-5 g/liter) precludes the&#13;
growing of vegetables and livestock breeding for domestic consumption.&#13;
19.    Water Quality. Water quality is universally poor in the disaster region and throughout Kzyl-&#13;
Orda Oblast in general. Consequently, several coping mechanisms are used to deal with inadequate and&#13;
poor-quality water. They consist of boiling water and drinking it as tea, rather than as plain water;&#13;
severely reducing the already low level of water consumption, and making further sacrifices in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
cleanliness and sanitation; using the highly-polluted hand-dug wells in home gardens; using rivers and&#13;
other open sources of water, despite knowing that they are polluted; paying exorbitant prices to vendors;&#13;
or walking long distances in search of alternative sources of water. The monetary, labor, and health costs&#13;
of this situation are extremely high.&#13;
20.   Water quality laboratories are being equipped with modern equipment provided by donors. Due&#13;
to the limited supply of chemical reagents and spare parts, however, there is a high risk that they will&#13;
soon be non-operational.&#13;
21.   Although, several local entities are responsible for sampling and analysis of water quality, the&#13;
information collected is not used for day-to day monitoring. Instead, information is used for statistical&#13;
purposes at the Oblast level. In the event of a severe contamination of a groundwater well, for example,&#13;
the population directly affected is not advised immediately. Instead, the responsible agency would have&#13;
to wait for an order from its line authority at the Oblast Level to respond to the emergency.&#13;
C. The Government's Objectives and Strategy&#13;
22.   In the late 1980s, in response to the Aral Sea environmental disaster, the Government developed&#13;
a long-term strategy and plan to improve the water supply in the Rayons of Aralsk and Kazalinsk. The&#13;
State Hydrological Design Institute (Kazgyprovodhoz) prepared a plan called the Aral-Sarbulak Water&#13;
Supply System, which was to be constructed in five phases. The plan was based on the development of a&#13;
new well field Northwest of the city of Aralsk, a primary distribution pipeline and pumping stations&#13;
connecting the well field to the cities of Aralsk and Novokazalinsk, and several sub-networks of&#13;
secondary pipelines and pumping stations to serve the large number of settlements throughout the region&#13;
from the main pipeline. The first Phase of this plan was constructed, but construction work on the second&#13;
phase (initiated in 1993) has been halted due to a lack of funds.&#13;
23.   At the instigation of the Kazak Government, the Kazakstan Aral Sea Community Rehabilitation&#13;
Project was included as a part of Program 5 of the "Action Plan for the Improvement of the Ecology of&#13;
the Aral Sea", which was adopted by the conference of Central Asian heads of state on January 11, 1994.&#13;
Project 5.3 of that Action Plan focuses on near-term improvements in the supply of clean water, and&#13;
improved sanitation and health for the people in the affected areas of Kazakstan. The Action Plan was&#13;
presented by The World Bank to the donor community in June 1994.&#13;
D. The Bank's Role and Strategy&#13;
24.   The project is fully consistent with the World Bank's country assistance strategy which is&#13;
designed to: (i) support macroeconomic stabilization and structural and sector reforms; (ii) strengthen&#13;
market incentives, particularly in agriculture and energy; and (iii) protect vulnerable groups through the&#13;
establishment of an effective safety net and more efficient service delivery. In addition, the Bank's&#13;
strategy is to provide support to ensure or expand access to basic social services which are largely&#13;
poverty-focused. Bank support would also be directed at strengthening the Government's institutional&#13;
capacity and acting as a catalyst for aid mobilization.&#13;
25.   The Bank's role in the social infrastructure sector is to support Government efforts to improve&#13;
the health status of rural populations in the southern regions of the country, which are most severely&#13;
affected by the consequences of the Aral Sea disaster, and which are the most poorly served with regard&#13;
to water supply, sanitation, and health. In this first operation in the sector, it is not proposed to address&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
sector-wide policies and issues at the national level, but to: (i) improve the cost effectiveness of&#13;
investments through project design; (ii) involve the participation of local stakeholders in selecting the&#13;
most efficient delivery mechanisms and in assessing their willingness and ability to pay for improved&#13;
social infrastructure; and (iii) improve the management and operation and financial viability of the&#13;
regional enterprises responsible for delivering these services.&#13;
E. Lessons from Past Bank Projects&#13;
26.    Lessons highlighted by the Department's FY94 Annual Report on Portfolio Performance in&#13;
Russia and Central Asia focus on: (i) the challenge of identifying a consistent counterpart team with&#13;
sufficient authority to move the project forward; (ii) the difficulty of coordinating among key&#13;
government agencies on critical issues; (iii) the importance of setting up PIUs early in the project cycle,&#13;
and the training of their staff in Bank procurement and disbursement procedures and requirements; and&#13;
(iv) the importance of involving local institutes in project design and preparation. The review of lessons&#13;
learned from water supply and sanitation projects worldwide shows that, despite efforts at capacity&#13;
building for the public institutions concerned, few countries achieved acceptable levels of performance&#13;
for their public water and sewerage utilities, and that the financial performance of these utilities was&#13;
equally poor. Some of the reasons for these deficiencies include: (i) lack of clear sector policies; (ii) lack&#13;
of management and financial autonomy; (iii) inexperience in project implementation; and (iv) lack of&#13;
participation of users and other stakeholders in the decision-making process.&#13;
27.    To the extent possible, these lessons are being incorporated into the preparation and design of the&#13;
full-scale project through: (i) an extensive social needs assessment survey, which has already been&#13;
completed; (ii) implementation of community-based pilot projects for water supply and distribution and&#13;
for health, hygiene and sanitation, which will be carried out during project preparation; (iii) a PIU is&#13;
being established immediately to supervise all project preparation and implementation activities; (iv)&#13;
through the PIU, the Government will execute the Kuwait Fund financed project preparation feasibility&#13;
study and PHRD funded pilot demonstration activity; and (v) local institutes and NGOs will be&#13;
contracted to assist in all these project preparation and design activities.&#13;
28.    The proposed community-based water supply and distribution pilot project to be financed under&#13;
this engineering loan will provide the Government and the Bank with early hands-on experience in&#13;
dealing with project design, management, and implementation issues and involvement of local&#13;
communities under the same conditions as that of the full-scale project. The lessons gained for this&#13;
experience will facilitate the implementation of the full-scale project and will likely result in improved&#13;
and streamlined implementation arrangements and a more clearly defined role of the communities in&#13;
process, allowing them to achieve the greatest possible benefits from the project.&#13;

PILOT WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
II. ARAL SEA COMMUNITY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
A. Full-Scale Project Objectives&#13;
29.   The objectives of the full-scale Aral Sea Community Rehabilitation Project, of which the&#13;
proposed Pilot Water Supply Project represents an initial learning phase, are to: (i) improve the health of&#13;
the urban and rural populations of the Kzyl-Orda Oblast through the provision of safe drinking water and&#13;
improved hygiene education and sanitation facilities; and (ii) to strengthen institutional capacity for the&#13;
management, operation and financial performance of the regional water supply and sanitation utilities.&#13;
B. Full-Scale Project Description&#13;
30.   Possible]/ components to be funded under the full-scale project include:&#13;
(i)    Safe Water Supply. Aimed at providing better water supply facilities to about 150,000&#13;
people living in the project area, this component would consist of two major&#13;
subcomponents:&#13;
(a)    Urban water supply. Under this subcomponent, activities such as leak detection&#13;
and control programs in thic two major cities of the project area, repair of main&#13;
pipelines of the Aralsk-Sawbulak system and rehabilitation of water supply network&#13;
will be implemented.&#13;
(b)    Rural water supply. This subcomponent would include design and construction of&#13;
rural water supply schemes, with the objective of providing basic water supply and&#13;
sanitation facilities owned and managed by the communities for presently&#13;
unserviced or underserviced rural settlements, by adopting a community-based&#13;
approach. It would also support activities for community mobilisation and&#13;
organizational development, including a package of activities for capacity building&#13;
and mobilizing organizations, as well as forming community-based organizations&#13;
to plan, implement and manage their own water supply.&#13;
(ii)    Environmental Sanitation. This component includes providing assistance to urban settlers&#13;
to build community sanitation facilities, as well as assisting rural communities to construct&#13;
improved household toilets;&#13;
1/    The final scope of the full-scale Aral Sea Community Rehabilitation Project will be agreed on based on&#13;
detailed recommendations developed by the feasibility study consultants, Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(iii)   Hygiene Education and Public Awareness. Realization of expected health benefits from&#13;
the project will largely depend on a successful hygiene education and public awareness&#13;
program. This component thus aims to enhance public participation and awareness in&#13;
managing water and sanitation services; and to educate the population about the&#13;
significance of effective hygiene practices for improving their health conditions; and&#13;
(iv)   Capacity Building. This component would assist the agencies responsible for water supply&#13;
at Oblast, city, and settlement levels. Technical assistance and training would be provided&#13;
for these agencies to enhance their efficiency, cost effectiveness, financial viability, and&#13;
also to make them managerially and financially self-sufficient.&#13;
31.   The preparation of this project included a major Social Assessment that involved extensive&#13;
stakeholder consultation, household surveys, and community focus group meetings to identify&#13;
stakeholder needs, priorities, and constraints, which will be used to enhance project design and&#13;
implementation arrangements. The feasibility study for the full-scale project is currently under&#13;
preparation and is expected to be completed by May 1997. On this basis, it is proposed to appraise this&#13;
project in June 1997, and to present the project to the Bank's Board in September 1997. Several donors,&#13;
including the Kuwait Fund and KfW, have expressed their interest in possibly co-financing this project.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
PILOT WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
HI. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Background of the Proposed Pilot Water Supply Project&#13;
32.   A USAID funded project executed by the CH2M Hill currently underway, aims to rehabilitate&#13;
two groups of wells in the Kosaman, and the Berdykol fields located 110km northwest from the city of&#13;
Aralsk, and the six pumping stations (including chlorination equipment) along the Aralsk-Sarbulak&#13;
transmission pipeline. The activities also include water quality monitoring improvements (provision of&#13;
laboratory equipment), water quality improvements (provision of chlorination equipment), and health&#13;
education (public health training). Because of unexpected high costs of these activities, the last pumping&#13;
station No. 7a in Novokazalinsk cannot be covered by this USAID funded project. The timely&#13;
completion of the USAID project has important implications for the proposed Pilot Water Supply&#13;
Project, and vice-versa. The full benefits of the USAID project will depend on the rehabilitation of the&#13;
Aralsk-Sarbulak pipeline, while water supply to the new pumping station No. 7a will depend on the&#13;
rehabilitation of the six pumping stations as proposed by USAID.&#13;
B.    Project Objectives&#13;
33.   The main objectives of this project are to: (i) gain experience in developing operational&#13;
methodologies and capabilities in all aspects of project processing, cost recovery aspects, international&#13;
procurement and contracting and in project management and implementation under the same conditions as&#13;
the full scale project through certain small scale investments, which need urgent attention and; (ii) speed up&#13;
implementation of the full-scale project through early completion of detailed engineering design and&#13;
preparation of bidding documents.&#13;
C.    Project Description&#13;
34.   The project consists of two components: (i) a small scale investment component to finance a&#13;
water supply and distribution pilot project in the Aralsk and Kazalinsk Rayons of Kzyl-Orda Oblast, as&#13;
well as implementation on a pilot basis of elements of the institutional reform action plan being prepared&#13;
under the full scale project feasibility study; and (ii) a technical assistance component for the review of&#13;
engineering designs, preparation of bid packages, and for the supervision of pilot project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
(i)    Small-Scale Pilot Water Supply Component&#13;
35.   This component will finance the following pilot projects:&#13;
(a)    Rehabilitation of the Aralsk-Sarbulak Pipeline. The reinforced concrete&#13;
transmission pipeline that delivers water from the Kosaman and Berdykol well&#13;
fields to Aralsk and Kazalinsk Rayons suffers from poor initial construction&#13;
practices, especially the method of laying and covering pipes, which has resulted&#13;
in a large number of leaks, with the largest number occurring between booster&#13;
pumping stations No. 2 and No. 3. Some repair work has already been undertaken&#13;
by local authorities, using steel and PVC pipes of smaller diameters than the&#13;
concrete pipe. This rehabilitation program will include the replacement and&#13;
rehabilitation of damaged concrete pressure pipes of approximately 1 Okm in length&#13;
and 800-1000 mm in diameter, at locations selected after the diagnostic study of&#13;
the pipeline to be carried out by the feasibility consultants Gibbs/CES.&#13;
(b)    Completion of the construction of the Pumping Station No. 7a in&#13;
Novokazalinsk. Construction of the pumping station in Novokazalinsk started&#13;
several years ago, but has not been completed because of a lack of financing.&#13;
Questions have been raised as to the suitability of the pumping station location,&#13;
because of seepage from the nearby irrigation canal and the frequent overtopping&#13;
of the canal. It would, therefore, be necessary to line the canal over a section of&#13;
some 500m along its boundary with the pumping station and to increase the wall&#13;
height over this section to prevent overtopping. In addition, it would be necessary&#13;
to purchase equipment and carry out works to complete the installation including:&#13;
finishing construction of the two storage reservoirs; and completion of&#13;
construction and installation of equipment in the main pumping station,&#13;
chlorination facility, warehouse/garage, power substation, and water control&#13;
laboratory.&#13;
(c)    Rehabilitation of the most corroded sections of distribution networks in the&#13;
cities of Novokazalinsk and Aralsk. Due to a lack of finance since the early&#13;
1990s, there has been limited work on replacement of corroded and badly leaking&#13;
sections of the existing piped water distribution networks in the two cities. Under&#13;
this component, the most deteriorated sections of the 60km and 70km networks in&#13;
the cities of Novokazalinsk and Aralsk, respectively (about 6km in each city), will&#13;
be replaced with new PVC piping ranging in diameter from 200 to 300mm. In&#13;
addition, to allow more effective functioning of the Vodokanals', it is proposed to&#13;
provide emergency assistance to upgrade their maintenance equipment, which is in&#13;
a bad state of disrepair, and to test on a pilot basis elements of the institutional&#13;
reform action plan.&#13;
(ii)   Technical Assistance Component&#13;
36.   The technical assistance component will finance the following sub-components:&#13;
(a)    Pilot Project Design and Supervision. This sub-component will: (i) review,&#13;
revise and improve as needed, and approve detailed engineering design for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11 -&#13;
pilot water supply project; (ii) prepare tender documents for the procurement of&#13;
goods and works; (iii) arrange international tenders for the procurement of goods&#13;
and works according to World Bank and GOK requirements, and assist in the&#13;
selection of successful bidders and in negotiating contracts; (iv) provide overall&#13;
supervision of pilot project implementation; (v) coordinate financing arrangements&#13;
and approve payments to suppliers and contractors; supervise construction to&#13;
ensure overall quality control; and (vi) monitor and report on implementation&#13;
progress. The Terms of Reference for this subcomponent is included in Annex F.&#13;
(b)    Project Implementation Unit. An independent Project Implementation Unit&#13;
(PIU) has been set up under the State Committee for Water Resources with initial&#13;
financing from a Japanese PHRD grant until the feasibility study work has been&#13;
completed. The PIU will be responsible for overall project management, approving&#13;
disbursements, and for financial management of the project. A Terms of Reference&#13;
for the operation of the PIU is given in Annex E&#13;
D.    Cost Estimates&#13;
37.   Total project costs, including physical contingencies, are estimated at US$7.388 million net of&#13;
taxes. This estimate covers expected expenditures in foreign exchange of US$5.904 million (79.9% of&#13;
total costs), and expected expenditure in local currency excluding taxes of US$1.484 million (20.1% of&#13;
total costs). The technical assistance component amounts to $0.678 million, equivalent to 9.2% of the&#13;
project costs. Details on project costs are given in Annex A, while Table 3.1 below summarizes project&#13;
cost estimates by component and category of expenditures.&#13;
38.   These costs were estimated by local authorities on the basis of a preliminary engineering design&#13;
for civil and mechanical works and recent quotations for equipment and material purchases. Base costs&#13;
are expressed in April 1996 prices and an exchange rate of 66 Tenge per one US dollar. Physical&#13;
contingencies are estimated at 20% of base costs for works, and 10% for equipment and technical&#13;
assistance. The annual price contingency rate is estimated at 3%.&#13;

Note: the discrepancies between this table and Annex A are due to the rounding off of figures.&#13;
E.    Project Financing&#13;
39.   The proposed Bank loan of $7.0 million will finance 100% of the project's foreign cost, and&#13;
about 39% of its local cost, including taxes. Bank financing of part of the local cost is needed because of&#13;
the stringent fiscal constraints that the Govemment of Kazakstan is expected to face in the coming years,&#13;
as well as the need to focus the pilot project's attention on technical and implementation issues, not fiscal&#13;
ones. The Bank loan to the Republic of Kazakstan will have a maturity of 20 years, including a 5-year&#13;
grace period, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The Govemment will finance about 20%&#13;
(US1,720) of total project cost, or 5.3% (US$388,000) of total project cost excluding taxes. Table 3.2&#13;
summarizes the financing plan for the project.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
PILOT WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    Implementation Arrangements&#13;
40.   A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) with offices in Almaty and Kzyl-Orda has already been set&#13;
up for the Aral Sea Community Rehabilitation Project, and a Project Implementation Consultant Group&#13;
(PICG) has been selected on a competitive basis from a short list of candidates. The Government will,&#13;
until completion of the project, maintain the PIU with functions and powers and adequate staff, funds,&#13;
facilities, and other resources reasonably required to carry out the project in a manner satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
41.   The feasibility study for the full-scale project is being funded by a grant of KD380,000&#13;
(approximately US$1,200,000) from the Kuwait Fund. A consortium of Sir Alexander Gibb (UK) and&#13;
CES (Germany) won the contract in competition with five other international firms. The contract&#13;
includes 38 months of foreign expert services, 150 months of local expert services, and 30 months of&#13;
support services, with the foreign firm managing the overall study. With the assistance of the Committee&#13;
of Water Resources, the foreign consulting firm is to make effective management coordination and task&#13;
contracting arrangements with the local institutes. As indicated in the TOR in Annex F, a foreign firm&#13;
will be contracted to check the detailed engineering design for the full-scale project and supervise start-&#13;
up and commissioning of the pilot projects. The detailed engineering design for the full-scale project will&#13;
be based on the feasibility study and will be prepared with the pilot project; but it may be financed by&#13;
grant or PPF funding, rather than by the loan for the pilot project. The PIU will assist the consultant with&#13;
logistical and office support, and its staff will receive on-the-job training in Bank procurement,&#13;
disbursement and contracting procedures. Agreement will be reached at negotiations on the Terms of&#13;
Reference for the pilot project engineering consultants.&#13;
42.   A detailed implementation schedule for the proposed Pilot Water Supply Project is given in&#13;
Annex B. As shown in this schedule, the implementation of the pilot project is expected to take&#13;
approximately 12 months and the detailed engineering design will be carried out over a period of&#13;
approximately 36 months. However, detailed engineering design and bidding documents for procurement&#13;
packages on the critical path for implementation of the full-scale project will be completed prior to&#13;
negotiations for the full-scale project.&#13;
B.    Procurement&#13;
43.   Goods. Goods and works will be procured in accordance with the provisions of the "Guidelines&#13;
for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the World Bank in January 1995 and&#13;
revised in January and August 1996. A communications system and vehicles, estimated to cost about&#13;
$49,000, will be procured using International Shopping procedures, based on price quotations from at&#13;
least three different suppliers in two different countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
44.   Works. Rehabilitation of the main pipeline, completion of the pumphouse (including the&#13;
supply, installation, and commissioning of the pumps), and rehabilitation of the supply network,&#13;
estimated to cost $8.0 million (including taxes), will be procured as a single works contract following&#13;
prequalification and ICB procedures.&#13;
45.   Consultant Services. Consultant services to be procured under the proposed pilot project are&#13;
expected to include the following:&#13;
(a)    A pilot project engineering consultant firm will be hired from a short list of consultants&#13;
following the World Bank's Guidelines "Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers&#13;
and by the World Bank as Executing Agency", August 1981. Detailed designs for the&#13;
works to be carried out under the pilot project have been made by Kazgidroprovodhoz.&#13;
The engineering consultant will be review and finalize these designs, prepare the bidding&#13;
documents, conduct the bidding, and supervise pilot project implementation. The&#13;
estimated cost of this assignment is $367,000.&#13;
(b)   The hiring of local experts by the PIU will be based on an evaluation of CVs of at least&#13;
three candidates.&#13;
46.   Bank Prior Review. All contracts for goods and works above US$250,000, contracts with&#13;
consulting firms above $100,000, and with individual consultants above $50,000 will be reviewed by the&#13;
Bank according to Appendix 1 of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits".&#13;
The Bank will review the negotiated contract for the sole source engineering design and supervision&#13;
consultant services. For the pilot project engineering services, the Bank will review the invitation&#13;
package, the evaluation report before announcing the successful bidder, and the negotiated contract prior&#13;
to signing. In addition the Bank will review contracts for individuals hired by the PIU, which cost more&#13;
than $50,000, and request Terms-of-Reference for consultants regardless of the value of the contract.&#13;

48.    Disbursements will be fully documented, except that Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) will be&#13;
used for: contracts for goods and works of less than US$250,000 equivalent; (ii) contracts with&#13;
consulting firms of less than US$100,000; and (iii) contracts with individual consultants of less than&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent. All other disbursements will be fully documented. Full documentation in support&#13;
of SOEs will be retained by the PIU for at least two years after disbursement. This information will be&#13;
available for review by World Bank missions during supervision, and by auditors. The minimum&#13;
application size for payments directly from the loan account or for issuance of special commitments is&#13;
20% of the current amount of special account authorizations.&#13;
49.   In order to facilitate disbursements, a Special Account (SA) will be established by the PIU in a&#13;
commercial bank, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The selected bank should have: (i) a&#13;
significant foreign correspondence network covering all currencies; (ii) reasonable capacity and&#13;
experience for issuing letters of credit, for making direct foreign payments and other international&#13;
transactions; (iii) the capacity to perform a wide range of banking services, at local branches, including&#13;
cash payments, transfers to other domestic banks, issuance of debit notes, application of conversion rates&#13;
from foreign currencies; (iv) the capacity to maintain adequate accounts for the SA as required by The&#13;
World Bank and provide monthly bank statements to the PIU; willingness to issue a Comfort Letter to&#13;
assure that amounts deposited in the SA will not be set off or otherwise seized or attached to satisfy&#13;
amounts due to the commercial bank by the Borrower: and (vi) the readiness to charge competitive rates&#13;
for their services and provide reasonable interest income on balances held. During the early stage of the&#13;
project, the initial allocation of the SA would be limited to $100,000. However, when the aggregate&#13;
disbursements under the loan have reached the level of US$1.5 million, the initial allocation may be&#13;
increased up to the authorized allocation of US$300,000 by submitting the relevant Application for&#13;
Withdrawal. Replenishment applications should be submitted at least every three months, and must&#13;
include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents.&#13;
D.    Accounting&#13;
50.    The project will have sound accounting and internal controls capable of reliably recording and&#13;
reporting all financial transactions. Accounting and internal control systems acceptable to the Bank will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
be put in place to allow the PIU to determine that procurement procedures are being followed and that&#13;
only eligible expenditures are included in disbursements and replenishment through the SA. This system&#13;
will be operational by the time expenditures begin. The operating procedures and manual developed&#13;
under the Russia Environmental Management Project (EMP) will be adapted for this purpose and hands-&#13;
on training of the PIU staff will be conducted in Moscow at the EMPs Center for Project Preparation and&#13;
Implementation (CPPI). This Center has trained the staff of other PIUs in Russia and is developing a&#13;
computer program suitable for Bank project accounting and for reporting of financial transactions to the&#13;
federal tax authorities. For the use of Statements of Expenditure, the PIU will process and maintain SOE&#13;
documentation. For the Special Account mechanism, the PIU and the depository commercial bank will&#13;
introduce arrangements for proper accounting of receipts, payments, and submission of disbursement&#13;
documentation to the Bank for replenishment of the account. The Borrower will, as a condition of loan&#13;
effectiveness, open a project account in a bank acceptable to the Bank, with an initial deposit of&#13;
counterpart funds in the amount of US$20,000 equivalent, and thereafter maintain that account with a&#13;
minimum balance deemed satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
E.    Reporting&#13;
51.   The PIU will provide quarterly reports to The World Bank covering the financial and physical&#13;
performance of the project. The financial status will be reported through the quarterly and annual&#13;
accounts which will reflect the cash receipts from all sources and expenditures related to each component&#13;
and category as well as the overall financial performance of the project. The detailed annual accounts for&#13;
the project will not only include expenditures directly financed by the World Bank loan, but also the&#13;
expenditures financed by the Government. These reports will reflect actual project expenditures versus&#13;
budgeted expenditures for the most recent fiscal quarter, fiscal year-to-date, and project inception-to-&#13;
date. The Project's annual audited financial statements will be prepared following the generally accepted&#13;
accounting principles as prescribed by the laws of Kazakstan. The PIU will: (a) no later than August 31&#13;
of each year starting in 1997, until completion of the project, present to the Bank for its review and&#13;
comments a progress report in a format and degree of detail acceptable to the Bank, as well as an action&#13;
plan and budget for the following year, together with a proposed timetable for its implementation; and&#13;
(b) carry out that action plan in accordance with the proposed timetable and taking into account the&#13;
Bank's comments, if any.&#13;
52.   As a Special Accounts and SOE will be used in this project, the PIU will submit, together with&#13;
accounts for the project, on a quarterly basis: (i) a schedule of SOE expenditures; and (ii) a summary of&#13;
the Special Account activity and reconciliation with the SA balance in the commercial bank account and&#13;
a summary of the activity in the project account. All unaudited quarterly reports will be submitted to&#13;
reach The World Bank no later than 30 days after the end of the quarter in question.&#13;
53.   Quarterly project reports on the physical performance of the project showing actual and planned&#13;
performance for the quarter and progress to-date will also be prepared and submitted to the Bank. These&#13;
reports, also to be submitted to reach the Bank no later than 30 days after the end of each quarter, will&#13;
include comments highlighting project progress and significant bottlenecks, showing an action plan for&#13;
remedial actions where necessary.&#13;
F.    Auditing&#13;
54.   Annual reports for the project accounts, including SOEs and Special Account for each fiscal&#13;
year, will be audited in accordance with generally accepted international auditing standards by an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank. The auditors will be appointed annually by the PIU at the&#13;
beginning of each fiscal year, so that the auditors may commence reviews sufficiently early in the fiscal&#13;
year to complete the audit in a timely manner. The auditors will prepare and submit an annual&#13;
Engagement Letter, which will be discussed and accepted by The World Bank prior to commencement of&#13;
the audit. The financial statements and the auditor's opinion and auditor's management reports, including&#13;
the PIU's response to the auditor's comments should be submitted to The World Bank no later than six&#13;
months after completion of the fiscal year in question.&#13;
G.    Supervision&#13;
55.   The Bank will supervise the project four times in the first year, because of the need to learn as&#13;
much as possible from implementation of the pilot project and to finalize the detailed engineering design&#13;
of the full-scale project in a timely manner. In subsequent years, supervision missions will be at the rate&#13;
of three times per year. A Bank supervision schedule is provided in Annex G.&#13;
H.    Performance Indicators&#13;
56.   In order to more closely monitor the performance of the proposed project, a set of perfornance&#13;
indicators have been developed as shown in Table 4.4. The reporting arrangements that have been agreed&#13;
with the PIU include these indicators as key factors in evaluating implementation progress and in&#13;
meeting the Government's development objectives. The Borrower will maintain policies and procedures&#13;
adequate to enable it to monitor and evaluate on an ongoing basis, in accordance with indicators&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank (see Table 4.4 below), the carrying out of the project and the achievement of its&#13;
objectives.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
PILOT WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
V. INSTITUTIONAL AND FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A.    Institutional Overview&#13;
57.   Several institutions play an important role in the water supply and sanitation sector in the project&#13;
area: the State Committee for Water Resources, the Ministry of Housing and Communal Services, the&#13;
Ministry of Health, and the District and Oblast Administrations.&#13;
(a)    The State Committee for Water Resources of the Republic of Kazakstan has broad water&#13;
resources management responsibilities, playing both a policy-making and an operative role&#13;
in the water resources sector. In the water supply sector, the State Committee has since July&#13;
1, 1995 been responsible for the design, construction, and operation of inter-regional water&#13;
transmission pipelines for both drinking and industrial purposes. Through one of its&#13;
affiliates, Kzyl-Orda Project and Construction Enterprise for Agricultural Water Supply&#13;
(Selkhozvodoprovod), the State Committee exercises responsibility for the construction&#13;
activities relating to the Aral-Sarbulak Pipeline. This water supply pipeline project is&#13;
managed in turn by two separate entities, called Repair and Maintenance Organizations&#13;
(R&amp;MO) No. 1 (Aralsk) and No. 2 (Kazalinsk). These entities are responsible for operating&#13;
and maintaining the main pipeline, reservoirs and booster pump stations - R&amp;MO No. I&#13;
from the well fields to Kambash (Akbai), and R&amp;MO No. 2 from Kambash to&#13;
Novokazalinsk - and monitoring of water quality along the pipeline. The entity No. I sells&#13;
water to Aralsk Vodokanal, Saksaul train station, rural settlements outside the city borders&#13;
(Kosaman, Zhamnbyl, Kulundi and Zhizhaga) and to the R&amp;MO No 2. The R&amp;MO No. 2,&#13;
in turn, sells water to Kazalinsk Vodokanal and four rural settlements outside the city&#13;
borders (Kumzhiek, Basikara, Muratbayev and Zhalantos Batyr).&#13;
(b)    The Ministry of Housing and Communal Services (MHCS) has the primary&#13;
responsibility over housing and urban services, including water supply and sanitation&#13;
policies and programs country-wide. The MHCS designates responsibilities for water&#13;
supply and sanitation services at the Oblast level to the Oblast Committee on Housing and&#13;
Communal Services. The Committee, in turn, entrusts responsibility to the Local Rayon&#13;
Administrations of each Rayon. Local Administrations supervise the Aralsk and Kazalinsk&#13;
Water Canalization and Sewerage Companies or Vodokanals. These Vodokanals in turn&#13;
operate and maintain independent water supply and treatment facilities and pumping&#13;
stations, and distribute water through secondary and tertiary networks to the cities of&#13;
Aralsk, Novokazalinsk and Kazalinsk, including city-based working settlements.&#13;
(c)    The Ministry of Health (MI) has, through the Department of Sanitation and&#13;
Epidemiology, the responsibility for monitoring drinking water quality, ensuring sanitary&#13;
conditions of water supply systems, controlling epidemics, and for sanitation and hygiene&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
education. The Department of Sanitation and Epidemiology also has branches at Oblast and&#13;
Rayon levels. In the project area, there are Sanitary and Epidemiology Stations (SES) in&#13;
both the Aralsk and Kazalinsk Rayons, which are responsible for: (i) the condition of the&#13;
water supply system; (ii) the inspection of water supply systems; and (iii) inspection of&#13;
public facilities from a public health perspective. More specifically, the SESs, are in theory&#13;
responsible for monitoring drinking water standards (which correspond to those of the&#13;
Former Soviet Union) in both urban and rural settlements.&#13;
58.    The current institutional framework can be characterized as follows:&#13;
(a)    Water service delivery agencies are just beginning to achieve some measure of autonomy&#13;
from local administrations, which own the water supply assets. The local administrations&#13;
are gaining some experience in being accountable to their constituents and at representing&#13;
the interests of the population.&#13;
(b)    Updated long-term development plans for the sector are completely lacking. Old plans,&#13;
based on the operating and subsidizing principles of the former system, are still in effect.&#13;
Operating entities are concerned with their immediate survival needs, coping with reduced&#13;
budget allocations for capital investments and recurrent expenditures. Service levels and&#13;
water quality of the piped water system are deteriorating rapidly.&#13;
(c)    Water rate structures are highly distorted, as shown below. For example, in December&#13;
1994 in Aralsk, domestic users accounted for 50% of total consumption and were&#13;
responsible for only 1% of total revenues. At the same time, industrial enterprises&#13;
accounted for 14% of total consumption, but were responsible for 39,8% of revenues.&#13;
During the first quarter of 1995, domestic users in Kazalinsk accounted for 78% of&#13;
consumption and contributed only 3% of total revenues, while industrial enterprises&#13;
accounted for 1% of total consumption and contributed 12% of total revenues. Because of&#13;
the long pumping distances, the major operating cost in the supply of the piped water to the&#13;
region is energy, accounting for 70-80% of the total operation and maintenance costs.&#13;
59.    The existing institutional, management, and organizational deficiencies will be addressed by the&#13;
development of an institutional reform action plan under the full-scale project. The Terms of Reference&#13;
for the full-scale project feasibility study includes a component focusing on the development of&#13;
institutional arrangements for water and sanitation utilities in the project area. This will serve as the&#13;
mechanism for developing the strategic action plan, which should be reviewed and agreed upon by the&#13;
various stakeholders in the sector as the basis for proceeding with the full-scale project. The succession&#13;
of projects and measures in the sector thus aims to ensure their long-term sustainability through&#13;
institutional strengthening and reform. The action plan will place particular emphasis on cost recovery&#13;
and improving the collection of water charges.&#13;
B.    Financial Issues&#13;
60.    Several important issues relating to project design will be addressed during preparation of the&#13;
feasibility study for the full-scale project. Those issues are listed below.&#13;
61.    Affordability. Results of the Social Needs Assessment indicate that households are paying as&#13;
much as $3/ m3 of delivered (possibly unsafe) water, and tend to consume between 15 and 25 liters/per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
person/day (I/p/d) for domestic purposes. By contrast, the few households connected to the piped water&#13;
supply system that do not experience problems with the service (about 16%) are paying a nominal fee of&#13;
$0.03/m of water, and consuming at a rate of 110 I/p/d. This seems to indicate that there is scope for&#13;
increasing the water tariff to improve cost recovery, especially since there is at present no revenue base&#13;
for expanding piped water supply services to more households.&#13;
62.   Level and Quality of Service. The Social Needs Assessment and the community focus group&#13;
meetings reveal that households are demanding an improved level and quality of service. About 70% of&#13;
the households interviewed demand piped water supply services, either inside the house or in the yard.&#13;
They also demand improvement in the quality of services in terms of reliability, the number of hours of&#13;
service, and the quality of water (especially in Kazalinsk Rayon). On average, households are prepared to&#13;
pay the equivalent of US$3.8 a month for improved services.&#13;
63.   Consumption Norms. The metering of domestic consumption is not practiced in either Rayon.&#13;
Instead, the Vodokanals assess household consumption once a year, based on norms and customer&#13;
surveys. The current norms are as follows: a standpipe, 20 liters per capita per day; a yard connection, 40&#13;
liters per capita per day; a house connection, 75 liters per capita per day; and a house connection with hot&#13;
water, 110 liters per capita per day. In the case of households with gardening and livestock, the following&#13;
norms are applied: gardening, 6,000 m3 per hectare per year; one cow, 70 liters per head per day (over 5&#13;
months); and one sheep, 12 liters per head per day (over 4 months). Households also pay on the basis of&#13;
the number of cars and motorcycles owned, for which the norms are as follows: one car, 40 liters per car&#13;
per day; and one motorcycle 15 liters per motorcycle per day. The handicapped and war veterans are&#13;
exempt from payment. Participants of the war in Afghanistan and survivors of Chernobyl, as well as&#13;
single mothers, pay half of the above rates.&#13;
64.   Only in Aralsk Rayon, the water consumption of users other than households is charged on a&#13;
volumetric basis, since meters have been installed on their premises. In Kazalinsk Rayon, however, water&#13;
consumed by enterprises is assessed based on a "contracted" volume, which is in turn negotiated on an&#13;
individual basis. In many cases, enterprises have responded to the high tariffs by closing the pipe&#13;
connection and obtaining water by truck, thereby avoiding the high water tariffs altogether. However,&#13;
because the trucks are owned by the Vodokanals, the authority effectively continues to supply water&#13;
without receiving the revenue for it.&#13;
65.    Water Conservation. Lack of macro and micro metering precludes an exact estimate of the&#13;
levels of water losses in the project area. Nevertheless, enough evidence suggests that a high level of&#13;
physical losses does exist, mainly as a consequence of inadequate water pricing policies, poor&#13;
accountability of the Vodokanals, and the failure to repair leaks and replace old pipes. The reduction in&#13;
physical losses is a cost effective way of providing water to additional consumers.&#13;

and Group III 10%.&#13;
2. Water rates in July 1995 were as follows: Group 1:1 TE/m3, Group II: 155 TE/m3 , and Group III: 263&#13;
TEBm3.&#13;
66.    Water Tariff Structures. Water tariff structures are highly distorted in both Rayons (see Tables&#13;
5.1 and 5.2). The preoccupation with ensuring highly subsidized prices for the population has prompted&#13;
the Aralsk and Kazalinsk Vodokanals to provide a heavy cross-subsidization to households from&#13;
industrial and commercial users.&#13;

Group III (profitable use)       2.1         1         550.0       1,155.0   12&#13;
Note: No consumer is charged based on the volume consumed. In the case of industrial enterprises, water&#13;
use is assessed based on a "contracted" volume estimated to be consumed. In most cases, both the rate and&#13;
the voluime are negotiated on an individual basis.&#13;
67.    Although existing tariffs cover operation and maintenance costs (albeit at a considerably reduced&#13;
rate), they greatly penalize industrial enterprises. While households pay about TE. 2.0 per m3, a profit-&#13;
making enterprise has to pay TE. 600 in Kazalinsk (about 750% of O&amp;M costs) and TE. 240 in Aralsk&#13;
(about 400% of O&amp;M costs). Very often, enterprises resort to disconnecting from Vodokanal services,&#13;
relying instead on piped water delivered by trucks (paying only TE. 80 per m 3 of water), or from other&#13;
water sources.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
PILOT WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
68.   The main benefit of and reason for implementing this pilot water supply project is to "learn-by-&#13;
doing" while providing for immediate and visible results in area that has been severely affected by the&#13;
Aral Sea disaster. Since this is the first time that the Bank has been involved in the water supply sector in&#13;
Kazakstan, there is much to learn regarding local engineering, design, and cost-estimating standards and&#13;
practices, the availability and quality of civil engineering contracting organizations, the supervision of&#13;
construction, materials and equipment procurement from local and foreign suppliers, the importing of&#13;
foreign goods and customs clearance procedures, etc. The early identification of constraints and the&#13;
means for overcoming difficulties experienced in the pilot project will greatly assist in the design of the&#13;
implementation arrangements for the full-scale project. A direct and immediate benefit will be&#13;
employment for locally unemployed construction workers in the project area, and improved water supply&#13;
and health conditions for some 30,000 people.&#13;
69.   Funding of the detailed engineering designs and the preparation of bidding documents for the&#13;
full-scale project under the engineering loan will considerably speed up the implementation of the main&#13;
project, as the bidding documents will be available for distribution at the time the main loan becomes&#13;
effective. This will speed up project implementation by at least 6 months. It will also provide&#13;
considerable training to the staff of the PIU in procurement and disbursement procedures.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
70.   Because of the small scale of the pilot project the risks are minimal, although delays are to be&#13;
expected. However, in order to further reduce the risk of delays, it is proposed to employ an experienced&#13;
foreign firm to work with the PIU staff and local design institutes to review detailed engineering designs&#13;
and to supervise procurement and contracting procedures, so that they conform with Bank requirements.&#13;
It is proposed to hire the same consulting firm that is working on the project feasibility study, in order to&#13;
speed up the implementation of the pilot project and to facilitate incorporating lessons learned into the&#13;
design of the implementation arrangements for the full-scale project. The impact of any delays in&#13;
completing the detailed engineering designs and procurement packages will be minimized by developing&#13;
a detailed implementation plan and concentrating the efforts on the facility designs that fall on the initial&#13;
critical path of the project.&#13;
C. Economic Rate of Return&#13;
71.   The economic analysis for this project assumed an average project economic life of 25 years&#13;
after construction, although the life of each individual component is quite different (35 years for the&#13;
pipelines and distribution networks, and 15 years for the pumping station). Cost and benefit streams&#13;
included only the incremental costs and benefits that would result from the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 25 -&#13;
72.   The economic viability of each individual component was assessed separately. The internal&#13;
economic rates of return (IERRs) of each component and of the overall project, based on the&#13;
aforementioned assumptions, are presented below, while the economic analysis for the project is&#13;
presented in greater detail in Annex I. The overall IERR of the project was estimated at 15.9%:&#13;

VII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
74.   During Negotiations, agreement was reached with the Borrower that:&#13;
(a)    The borrower will, until completion of the project, maintain the PIU with functions and&#13;
powers and adequate staff, funds, facilities, and other resources reasonably required to&#13;
carry out the project in a manner satisfactory to the Bank (para. # 40);&#13;
(b)    As a condition of loan effectiveness, the borrower will open a project account in a bank&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, with an initial deposit of counterpart funds in the amount of&#13;
US$20,000 equivalent, and thereafter maintain that account with a minimum balance&#13;
deemed satisfactory to the Bank (para. #50); and&#13;
(c)    The PIU will (i) no later than August 31 of each year starting in 1997, until completion of&#13;
the project, present to the Bank for its review and comments a progress report in a&#13;
format and degree of detail acceptable to the Bank, as well as an action plan and budget&#13;
for the following year, together with a proposed timetable for its implementation; and&#13;
(ii) carry out that action plan in accordance with the proposed timetable and taking into&#13;
account the Bank's comments, if any (para. #5 1).&#13;
(d)    The Borrower will maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable it to monitor and&#13;
evaluate on an ongoing basis, in accordance with indicators satisfactory to the Bank, the&#13;
carrying out of the project and the achievement of its objectives (para. #56).&#13;
75.   Recommendation: The proposed project is in accordance with the Bank's Articles of Agreement&#13;

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE AND PROCUREMENT PLAN&#13;
1.    Project Implementation Schedule: Implementation of the project is expected to proceed according&#13;
to the schedule in Table B2 (see next page). Slippages may result from unforeseen constraints that may arise&#13;
in implementing the pilot project, but it is for the purpose of identifying these constraints that the pilot&#13;
project is being implemented in the first place. The detailed engineering design component is expected to&#13;
proceed into the implementation phase of the full-scale project and the second phase of this work will be&#13;
funded under the follow up loan.&#13;
2.     The procurement plan for this project is summarized in Table B 1:&#13;

ANNEX E&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION CONSULTANT GROUP&#13;
1.    The Project Implementation Consultant Group (PICG) will be set-up under the State Committee for&#13;
Water Resources of the Republic of Kazakstan. It will be responsible for project preparation and&#13;
implementation and will have two offices, in Almaty and Kzyl-Orda. Office equipment for the Almaty and&#13;
Kzyl-Orda offices has been provided by a Dutch Consultant Trust Fund in The World Bank. The PICG is&#13;
being financed during project preparation by a grant from the Japanese PHRD.&#13;
2.    The PICG will provide the following services to the State Committee for Water Resources&#13;
regarding project preparation and implementation:&#13;
(a) Liaison;&#13;
(b) Procurement;&#13;
(c) Disbursement;&#13;
(d) Reporting, Accounting and Auditing;&#13;
(e) Information exchange; and&#13;
(f) Policies concerning the above.&#13;
3.    Liaison: The PICG will provide liaison with donors, ministries, the World Bank and other public&#13;
entities NGOs and the public on project activities. Such liaison will include facilitating the interaction of&#13;
concerned entities and the provision of information as described in paragraph 6 below. In this regard, the&#13;
PICG will be the consolidated repository for project information and data which it will make available to&#13;
concerned entities in appropriate formats. Also the PICG will assist the State Committee for Water&#13;
Resources in organizing and coordinating seminars and workshops to disseminate project progress, results&#13;
and lessons learned, both for the Government of Kazakstan, NGO and public audiences, and for interested&#13;
donors and suppliers of goods and services.&#13;
4.    Procurement: The PICG will have general responsibility for the administration of the procurement&#13;
of equipment, goods and services required for the project. In undertaking procurement of equipment and&#13;
goods, the PICG will follow The World Bank Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits and, for selecting and employing professional services, will follow the Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency. The specific&#13;
responsibilities and arrangements for procurement will be as follows:&#13;
(i)    Equipment and Goods: The PICG will have the responsibility for procuring all the&#13;
equipment required for the project. In general, the equipment to be procured will follow the&#13;
lists given in the Procurement Annex to the IBRD Staff Appraisal Report (SAR). However,&#13;
as project preparation and implementation progresses there may be amendments to these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
lists. The PICG should consolidate the lists, prepare specifications and confirm with design&#13;
consultants and project managers, that the specifications meet the needs of the project&#13;
component. Wherever possible, equipment needs should be combined in packages with&#13;
ICB being used for all packages with estimated values over a to be specified threshold&#13;
value. Some equipment will be required later in the project cycle and if the equipment&#13;
specifications are agreed, then the PICG should use its best judgment to determine whether:&#13;
(a) to include this as part of early packages with delayed delivery timed to best meet the&#13;
needs of the project; (b) procure with the bulk of the equipment and either store or deliver&#13;
early to the appropriate agency (bearing in mind possible security risks); or (c) whether to&#13;
procure the equipment separately when needed. Packages with an estimated value under&#13;
the ICB threshold may be procured through International Shopping. "National shopping"&#13;
may be used for supplies and minor items readily available locally and, where bulk&#13;
procurement would not be more economical.&#13;
(ii)   The selection and employment of professional services: The PICG will act as a&#13;
service agency and facilitator for the selection and employment of professional services.&#13;
Such services may be provided from foreign and Kazakstan sources by: (a) consulting&#13;
firms and individuals and (b) Institutes. The PICG can hire consultants to assist its work&#13;
and can assist the State Committee for Water Resources in preparing invitation packages,&#13;
selecting consultants and negotiating contracts with consultant firms which will be hired by&#13;
the State Committee for Water Resources. Based on the Guidelines for "Use of Consultant&#13;
by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency," the selection of&#13;
consulting firms will be through evaluation of proposals received from a shortlist of firms&#13;
(not less than three, no more than six). Selection of individuals will be through the&#13;
evaluation of at least three CVs. The PICG will provide support to the State Committee for&#13;
Water Resources by assisting in the preparation of long lists of firms from which the State&#13;
Committee for Water Resources will choose the short list. Selection committees will&#13;
usually be convened by the State Committee for Water Resources. While the PICG will be&#13;
represented on selection committees, the majority of the State Committee for Water&#13;
Resources members should be involved with project implementation. The PICG will&#13;
handle the mailing of the invitation package to the shortlisted firms and receiving and&#13;
recording the proposals. Given its rapid build up of experience, the PICG should jointly&#13;
with the State Committee for Water Resources, negotiate contracts with the consulting&#13;
firms. Individual contracts will be negotiated on the basis of a standard scale of salaries and&#13;
conditions. For both firms and individuals, standard contracts issued by the World Bank&#13;
will be used. For firms this will be The World Bank Standard Contracts; for individuals,&#13;
the standard individual contract of the PICG.&#13;
(iii)   Training and Advice: Based on the Bank's guidelines, the PICG will prepare a&#13;
procurement manual which should amplify the procedures given in the Guidelines and&#13;
explain in detail the responsibilities and procedures to be followed by the Project&#13;
Implementation Agencies. The PICG will also provide training in professional services&#13;
selection and contract administration. The PICG will maintain a library of terms of&#13;
reference, job descriptions, and contract documentation and will build up a data base of&#13;
information on consulting firms and equipment suppliers. The PICG will also assist in the&#13;
administrative matters related to training workshops to be mounted by the Project&#13;
Implementing Agencies and with training and secondments overseas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
5.    Disbursement: The PICG will be responsible for the disbursement of funds, the preparation of&#13;
withdrawal applications and the collection, maintenance of all relevant documents. The Bank's&#13;
Disbursement Handbook which details disbursement procedures for IBRD Loans, provides the information&#13;
on procedures and should be considered a part of these Terms of Reference. Withdrawal applications will&#13;
be fully documented, except for expenditures against contracts less than US$50,000 equivalent, which will&#13;
be made on certified Statements of Expenditures detailing the individual transactions. The documents to&#13;
support these expenditures will be retained by the PICG for at least one year after the receipt by the Bank of&#13;
the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement was made. This documentation will be made&#13;
available for review by the auditors (see section below on "Reporting, Accounting and Auditing") and the&#13;
Bank upon request.&#13;
6.    Financial Reporting, Accounting and Auditing: The PICG will establish a management&#13;
information system which, at a minimum, will cover:&#13;
(a)    All equipment and goods procurement activities;&#13;
(b)    All consultants and personnel employed under the Project;&#13;
(c)    All financial activities including payments and disbursements;&#13;
(d)    An accounting system following generally accepted international standards in order to&#13;
provide information on the receipt and use of funds and in line with the terms of the Loan&#13;
Agreement. The system would ensure timely and accurate accounting of all transactions&#13;
under the Loan, and a clear presentation of financial information. It should enable&#13;
identification of the use of all funds by components and categories of equipment and goods&#13;
procured and consultants and personnel employed and paid under the project. The&#13;
accounting system should reflect the movement and receipts and payments through the&#13;
Special Account with balances agreed with monthly financial statements form the holding&#13;
commercial bank and with periodic statements from The World Bank; and&#13;
(e)    An auditing system to meet the requirements of the Government of Kazakstan and The&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
Detailed requirements for the above, including the determination of responsibilities for the&#13;
provision of data and reports on subprojects, will be developed during the 9 month start-up phase of the&#13;
PICG.&#13;
7.    Information Exchange: The PICG will ensure the organization and management of information&#13;
reporting and database maintenance to meet the needs of the project and donors and lenders participating in&#13;
the project. Information management will include that developed by the systems in paragraph 7 above and&#13;
will also include written reports, both as specified under the Loan Agreement, but also as required for the&#13;
dissemination of information to entities of the Government of Kazakstan, donors and to the participants in&#13;
the project.&#13;
8.    Employment of Personnel: The PICG will develop personnel employment policies to ensure&#13;
appropriate consistency by all the project participants. Over and above the employment activities as&#13;
indicated in paragraph 4 above, the PICG will engage individual experts for the purpose of staffing the&#13;
PICG.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
9.    Development of PICG Policies and Procedures: The detailed functions of the PICG and its&#13;
structure, policies and operations will evolve over time - particularly during the start-up phase. These Terms&#13;
of Reference provide a starting point for the PICG operations. However, it is expected that they will be&#13;
revised, amplified and amended fiom time to time to more adequately meet the needs of the project.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
PILOT WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX F&#13;
PART A: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE PILOT PROJECT ENGINEERING CONSULTANT&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    One of the planet's most serious environmental and human tragedies continues to unfold in the&#13;
basin of the Aral Sea. Over the past 34 years, the sea has steadily shrunk as a result of a huge reduction in&#13;
inflow from its tributaries, the rivers Amu Darya and Syr Darya, primarily due to the increasing use of&#13;
water for irrigation of rice and other food grains, fodder, and cotton. In the aggregate, between 1960 and&#13;
2&#13;
1993 the area of the Aral Sea decreased by 52%, from 69,000 to 33,000 km , and its volume fell by 74%&#13;
from 1083 to 277 km3. The environmental and economic consequences of the Aral's desiccation have been&#13;
enormous.&#13;
2.    One of the areas hardest hit by the conditions that led to the Aral Sea crisis is along the Syr Darya&#13;
river in Kazakstan's Kzyl-Orda Oblast (with an area of 228,000 kM2 and a total population of 598,000).&#13;
Especially heavily affected are two Rayons: Aralsk and Kazalinsk, which are now among the poorest and&#13;
most devastated parts of Kazakstan and Central Asia. Two thirds of the disaster area's population live in the&#13;
cities of Aralsk, Novokazalinsk, and Kazalinsk. The rural population is also concentrated in large&#13;
settlements: over 60% live on state farms with more than 1,000 persons.&#13;
3.    Before the start of the Aral Sea disaster and the associated desertification, salinization of the&#13;
groundwater, and loss of pasture land, forests, and sources of spring water, the population of Kzyl-Orda&#13;
enjoyed access to safe drinking water and the towns were able to use nearby springs and wells. In the 1960s,&#13;
when water quality in the Syr Darya was still good, water was taken from the river at a point near the&#13;
community. Rapid deterioration in the river's water quality has forced the construction of a major regional&#13;
water supply scheme. However, the new scheme does not extend to all communities. Those not covered and&#13;
those provided with very unreliable service still rely on the old, often unsafe, supply arrangements.&#13;
4.    A project to improve the water supply, sanitation and health of the population affected by the Aral&#13;
Sea crisis in Kzyl-Orda Oblast was identified as part of a wide-ranging package of projects prepared by the&#13;
donor community in support of the "Disaster Zone". Project identification, combined with the Stakeholders&#13;
Seminar held in November 27, 1995, led to the formulation of two concurrent project preparation activities:&#13;
(i) an overall project feasibility study, followed by its implementation, and (ii) a small engineering project&#13;
to ensure the water supply in the cities of Aralsk and Novokazalinsk, as well as to test and develop&#13;
methodologies and define investment requirements for improving the health, hygiene, and sanitation in&#13;
selected rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Pilot Project Description&#13;
2.    The Pilot project includes the following components:&#13;
(a)    Rehabilitation of the Main Pipeline. The transmission pipeline that delivers water from&#13;
the Kosaman and Berdykol well fields to Aralsk and Kazalinsk Rayons suffers from poor&#13;
initial construction practices. In particular, the method of tapping pipes has resulted in a&#13;
large number of leaks, of which the largest number occur between Booster Pump Stations&#13;
No. 2 and No. 3. Some repair work has already been undertaken using steel and PVC pipes&#13;
of smaller diameter than the concrete pipes. The rehabilitation program will provide for a&#13;
new pipeline of adequate diameter and suitable material. It will include the replacement of&#13;
concrete pressure pipes of approximately 7 km in length and 1000 mm in diameter between&#13;
Booster Pump Stations No. 2 and No. 3., and the rehabilitation of damaged pipes of&#13;
approximately 3 km in length and 800 mm in diameter at locations selected after&#13;
examining the pipeline.&#13;
(b)    Booster Pump  Station  Completion. Construction  of the pumping  station in&#13;
Novokazalinsk (Booster Pump Station No. 7) started several years ago, but was abandoned&#13;
in 1992. Current civil works have been roughly estimated to be less than $80,000. Its&#13;
current location, however, is considered to be unsatisfactory, given that the area is prone to&#13;
frequent floods. This subcomponent will provide for the construction of a totally new&#13;
pumping station in a different location, unless the feasibility study recommends that the&#13;
existing site is safe. The subcomponent includes the pumphouse, two reservoirs, a&#13;
chlorinating facility, a water-quality control laboratory, a power substation, and a&#13;
warehouse or storage facility.&#13;
(c)    Rehabilitation of the most corroded sections of distribution networks in the cities of&#13;
Novokazalinsk and Aralsk. Due to a lack of finance since the early 1 990s, there has been&#13;
limited work on replacement of corroded and badly leaking sections of the existing piped&#13;
water distribution networks in the two cities. Under this component the most deteriorated&#13;
sections of the 60km and 70km networks in the cities of Novokazalinsk and Aralsk,&#13;
respectively, will be replaced with new PVC piping of approximately 6km in length in each&#13;
city ranging in diameter from 200 to 300mm. In addition to allow more effective&#13;
functioning of the Vodokanal maintenance departments it is also proposed to provide&#13;
emergency assistance to upgrade their maintenance equipment, which is in a very bad state&#13;
of disrepair.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
3.   The objectives of the assignment are to test on a pilot basis the engineering design, procurement,&#13;
contracting and supervision requirement for water supply and distribution schemes in the region&#13;
proposed for the Kazakstan: Pilot Project Management. The lessons gained from this experience will be&#13;

PART B: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE DETAILED ENGINEERING DESIGN CONSULTANT FOR THE&#13;
F ULL-SCALE ARAL SEA COMMUNITY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    One of the planet's most serious environmental and human tragedies continues to unfold in the&#13;
basin of the Aral Sea. Over the past 34 years, the sea has steadily shrunk as a result of a huge reduction in&#13;
inflow from its tributaries, the rivers Amu Darya and Syr Darya, primarily due to the increasing use of&#13;
water for irrigation of rice and other food grains, fodder, and cotton. In the aggregate, between 1960 and&#13;
1993 the area of the Aral Sea decreased by 52%, from 69,000 to 33,000 km 2, and its volume fell by 74%&#13;
from 1083 to 277 km'. The environmental and economic consequences of the Aral's desiccation have been&#13;
enormous.&#13;
2.    One of the areas hardest hit by the conditions that led to the Aral Sea crisis is along the Syr Darya&#13;
river in Kazakstan's Kzyl-Orda Oblast (with an area of 228,000 km2 and a total population of 598,000).&#13;
Especially heavily affected are two Rayons: Aralsk and Kazalinsk, which are now among the poorest and&#13;
most devastated parts of Kazakstan and Central Asia. Two thirds of the disaster area's population live in the&#13;
cities of Aralsk, Novokazalinsk, and Kazalinsk. The rural population is also concentrated in large&#13;
settlements: over 60% live on state farms with more than 1,000 persons.&#13;
3.    Before the start of the Aral Sea disaster and the associated desertification, salinization of the&#13;
groundwater, and loss of pasture land, forests, and sources of spring water, the population of Kzyl-Orda&#13;
enjoyed access to safe drinking water and the towns were able to use nearby springs and wells. In the 1960s,&#13;
when water quality in the Syr Darya was still good, water was taken from the river at a point near the&#13;
community. Rapid deterioration in the river's water quality has forced the construction of a major regional&#13;
water supply scheme. However, the new scheme does not extend to all communities. Those not covered and&#13;
those provided with very unreliable service still rely on the old, often unsafe, supply arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
Full-Scale Project Objectives&#13;
4.     A project to improve the water supply, sanitation and health of the population affected by the Aral&#13;
Sea crisis in Kzyl-Orda Oblast was identified as part of a wide-ranging package of projects prepared by the&#13;
donor community in support of the "Disaster Zone". The objectives of the full-scale Aral Sea Community&#13;
Rehabilitation Project are to: (i) improve the health of the urban and rural populations of the Kzyl-Orda&#13;
Oblast through the provision of safe drinking water and improved hygiene education and sanitation&#13;
facilities; and (ii) to strengthen institutional capacity for the management, operation and financial&#13;
performance of the regional water supply and sanitation utilities.&#13;
Full-Scale Project Description&#13;
Possible2/ components to be funded under the full-scale project include:&#13;
(i)    Safe Water Supply. Aimed at providing better water supply facilities to about 150,000&#13;
people living in the project area, this component would consist of two major&#13;
subcomponents:&#13;
(a)    Urban water supply. Under this subcomponent, activities such as leak detection&#13;
and control programs in the two major cities of the project area, repair of main&#13;
pipelines of the Aral Sarbulak system and rehabilitation of water supply network&#13;
will be implemented.&#13;
(b)    Rural water supply. This subcomponent would include design and construction of&#13;
rural water supply schemes, with the objective of providing basic water supply and&#13;
sanitation facilities owned and managed by the communities for presently&#13;
unserviced or underserviced rural settlements, by adopting a community-based&#13;
approach. It would also support activities for community mobilisation and&#13;
organizational development, including a package of activities for capacity building&#13;
and mobilizing organizations, as well as forming community-based organizations&#13;
to plan, implement and manage their own water supply.&#13;
(ii)    Environmental Sanitation. This component includes providing assistance to urban settlers&#13;
to build community sanitation facilities, as well as assisting rural communities to construct&#13;
improved household toilets;&#13;
(iii)   Hygiene Education and Public Awareness. Realization of expected health benefits from&#13;
the project will largely depend on a successful hygiene education and public awareness&#13;
program. This component thus aims to enhance public participation and awareness in&#13;
managing water and sanitation services; and to educate the population about the&#13;
significance of effective hygiene practices for improving their health conditions; and&#13;
(iv)   Capacity Building. This component would assist the agencies responsible for water supply&#13;
at Oblast, city, and settlement levels. Technical assistance and training would be provided&#13;
2/     The final scope of the full-scale Aral Sea Community Rehabilitation Project will be agreed on based on&#13;
detailed recommendations developed by the feasibility study consultants, Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
for these agencies to enhance their efficiency, cost effectiveness, financial viability, and&#13;
also to make them managerially and financially self-sufficient.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
6.     The main objective of the services to be provided under the first phase of this assignment is to&#13;
prepare the detailed engineering designs and procurement packages for goods, works and services to be&#13;
provided for the full scale water supply, sanitation and health project. The second phase of the work will&#13;
include project management, negotiating contracts with suppliers and supervision of construction and&#13;
start up of the project.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
PILOT WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX H&#13;
SOCIAL ASSESSMENT - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
1.    The Republic of Kazakstan is preparing a water supply, sanitation and health project to alleviate the&#13;
severe living conditions associated with the ecological crisis in the Aral Sea Basin. The project, as&#13;
originally conceived, focuses on the two districts of the country most affected by the crisis, Aralsk and&#13;
Kazalinsk. These districts are isolated from the country's major population centers and are the most&#13;
economically depressed and socially vulnerable in Kazakstan. Due to extreme poverty and lack of&#13;
employment opportunities in these areas, many inhabitants, particularly the more skilled, have either moved&#13;
out or are planning to leave. In preparing the Kazakstan Water Supply, Sanitation, and Health Project, a&#13;
Social Assessment (SA) was carried out to ensure that the project responds to the needs of the intended&#13;
beneficiaries, particularly the poor.&#13;
Proposed Project Areas&#13;
2.     The Aralsk and Kazalinsk Rayons (districts) are located in the Kzyl-Orda Oblast (region) and have&#13;
a combined population of about 150,000. Aralsk is situated in the north-east part of the region which&#13;
borders the Aral Sea. Aralsk, the center of this district, was originally settled near an old fishing village&#13;
during the construction of the Orenberg-Tashkent Railway (1903-1905), a principal trunkline to the East. It&#13;
later became the administrative center of the district and eventually flourished as a local industrial center&#13;
and tourist attraction. Kazalinsk, which is situated in the western part of the Kzyl-Orda Region, was&#13;
originally settled as a fort town near the Syr Darya River, but was superseded by the creation of&#13;
Novokazalinsk during the construction of the railway. Novokazalinsk eventually became a regional&#13;
administrative center as well and is now the largest settlement in the district.&#13;
3.    Since independence, the economies of both districts have been severely debilitated. Many of the&#13;
problems are similar to those faced by people in other parts of Kazakstan: the collapse of previous trading&#13;
structures, sources of raw materials, and other inputs; the absence of alternative markets; greatly distorted&#13;
prices for both new and processed goods; and the substantial reduction of budgetary allocations from the&#13;
central and regional governments. The combined effect has been an increase in unemployment, delayed or&#13;
unpaid salaries, and disguised unemployment as employees are put on indeterminate, unpaid leave. These&#13;
problems have been exacerbated by the great distance of the two districts from any potential markets or&#13;
sources of materials, as well as their dependency on three local industries: fish processing, wood working,&#13;
and ship repair. Of the three, only one has been able to adapt to the new circumstances; the ship repair&#13;
factory now repairs railroad cars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

SA Objectives and Activities&#13;
The principal objectives of the SA were to: (1) determine the actual extent of the&#13;
out-migration from Aralsk and Kazalinsk as well as anticipated trends; (2) identify any&#13;
prospects (including an improved water supply) that would improve living standards in the&#13;
area and therefore induce people to remain in the area; and (3) determine the extent to&#13;
which the population considers the proposed water sanitation and health project to meet a&#13;
major need. The SA consisted of the following activities, a number of which involved&#13;
substantial participation by the intended beneficiaries as well as govermnent agencies, local&#13;
research institutes, and private firns.&#13;
Demographic and Ethnographic Studies. These included studies of the area to determine&#13;
demographic trends, physical hardships of local residents, and whether the area was in&#13;
decline. In addition, ethnographic studies of Aralsk and Kazalinsk focused on the response&#13;
of people to limited, irregular, and poor quality water supplies. These studies were&#13;
complemented by a detailed socioeconomic inventory of a number of communities,&#13;
covering: major institutions, community infrastructure, population and employment, and&#13;
the impact of the water system and tariff on behavior&#13;
*      IHousehold Survey. A socioeconomic survey of 500 households focused on income,&#13;
employment, household assets, migration patterns, access to water and sanitation,&#13;
perceptions of water availability and quality, water costs, water system preferences, and&#13;
ability and willingness to pay for improved water supplies. The survey also was designed&#13;
to identify opportunities for community participation in planning water system&#13;
improvements and in solving other problems.&#13;
*     Complementary Studies. To supplement the household survey, the SA involved a set of&#13;
complementary studies: in-depth interviews with managers of 23 enterprises and&#13;
state/collective farms concentrating on their current economic status, labor structure, water&#13;
use, constraints, and opportunities; a rapid assessment of water delivery institutions in the&#13;
area; and an appraisal of economic prospects for the two districts.&#13;
*     Focus Group Discussions. Seven focus group discussions throughout the project area&#13;
centered on the population's perceptions of the links between improved water supplies and&#13;
economic opportunities, participation, health, and migration.They were designed to provide&#13;
additional input from key stakeholders to interpret the results of the household survey and&#13;
to generate information that could not be obtained in the survey.&#13;
Key Findings&#13;
4.    The SA provided a rich, vivid portrait of the declining quality of life in the area and revealed&#13;
important informnation about the stability of the populations in Aralsk and Kazalinsk; priority ranking of&#13;
water, sanitation, and health among other problems people face; the extent to which water is important to&#13;
maintain livestock production and to re-introduce gardening; and willingness to pay for improvements. The&#13;
following are key findings of the SA:&#13;
*     According to the household survey, 37% of the respondents indicated a desire to relocate.&#13;
In Kazalinsk, the percentage who want to move is as high as 46 %; in Aralsk, 29 %. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
majority (84 %) of respondents who desire to emigrate said that the main reason&#13;
influencing the desire to migrate is the "ecological situation," which refers to the overall&#13;
economic and physical deterioration in the Aral Sea zone. The people most likely to want&#13;
to emigrate are the higher income, more highly educated skilled people, those who could be&#13;
expected to play the most important roles in rebuilding the economy.&#13;
Despite the large percentage of respondents who want to move, the percentage of&#13;
respondents in both districts that are actually ready to move is much smaller (11 % of the&#13;
whole or 30 % of those willing to move). Their principal reasons for remaining in the area&#13;
are lack of money (83 %) and lack of transport (12%), as well as the lack of housing and&#13;
employment elsewhere. The survey also revealed that the desire to move could be reduced&#13;
by: increasing wages (62%), improving the environment (41%), providing employment&#13;
opportunities (36%), improving living conditions (34 %), expanding opportunities for&#13;
children (8%), and supplying more water (8 %).&#13;
*      The household survey revealed that many people have access to water from a variety of&#13;
sources, sometimes using different sources for different purposes. Sixty-two % of the&#13;
sample have access to piped water either in their yards, house, street, or neighbor's house.&#13;
Water pressure is low and pipeline failures are common; thus, even communities that are&#13;
served by piped water are without water at least 25 % of the time. Among those with&#13;
access to a piped water source, 76 % said that water was available less than 10 days during&#13;
the month before the survey and 37 % said that they have water less than 6 hours a day&#13;
when it is available. Water availability varies by season as well; 40 % of the sample said&#13;
that piped water is less available during the winter than summer.&#13;
-     Dissatisfaction with the water supply service is high; 31 % of the respondents said that the&#13;
quality of their water is poor. The other principal complaints are its high price (24 %) and&#13;
distance from the house (22 %). Only 24 % said that they drink water directly from the&#13;
tap; 76 % drink boiled water and 46 % consume water primarily in tea. The highest levels&#13;
of complaints were recorded in Kazalinsk. In Aralsk, the rural and working settlements&#13;
complained about the poor quality of water more frequently than the regional centers,&#13;
which have better access to the Aralsk-Sarbulak water.  Among those that complained&#13;
about the poor quality of potable water, the majority were concemed about the muddiness&#13;
and saltiness of the water.&#13;
*      The cost of coping with inadequate water supplies is high. Where piped water systems are&#13;
unavailable or inoperable, people generally obtain water by tank trucks and store it in&#13;
above-ground tanks. Although the official tariff for domestic water is 2 Tenge (US$.03)&#13;
per cubic meter, water deliveries arranged by the urban or farm administration cost around&#13;
40 Tenge (US$.63) per tank (about 1.5 m3), and transport (petrol) costs an additional 60&#13;
Tenge (US$.95). Families who make their own arrangements pay as much as 280 Tenge&#13;
(US$4.44) per truck, or 185 Tenge per cubic meter, 90 times the official tariff for domestic&#13;
water.&#13;
*      The water sector needs institutional restructuring and tariff reforms to increase efficiency,&#13;
decrease production costs and improve service, and to generate revenues by increasing&#13;
customers and capturing a greater share of the costs consumers actually pay to improve&#13;
operation and maintenance. In particular, tariffs for industrial and animal production have&#13;
to be rationalized so as to support economic growth rather than constrain it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
*      Throughout the proposed project area, both sanitation and hygiene practices are adequate,&#13;
given the water situation, but not up to modem standards. The majority of respondents (52&#13;
%) admitted that they simply pour the wastewater directly on the ground; at best, 41 %&#13;
discharge their wastewater into a cess pit in the yard near the house. Only 5 % of the&#13;
families are connected to a central sewer system and 2 % are connected to a local sewer&#13;
system.&#13;
*      Due to the environmental conditions associated with the Aral Sea crisis and the scarcity of&#13;
safe water, only 40 % of the respondents said that their health was "good enough"; 37 %&#13;
complained that the health of their family members was "not good"; and 6 % of the&#13;
respondents said that the health of their relatives was poor. These findings are consistent&#13;
with statements by the Director of the Regional Hospital in Kazalinsk, who cites poor&#13;
water quality, especially the high concentration of nitrates, as a key factor in the&#13;
deteriorated health status of the district, particularly:&#13;
(a)    The number of cases with umbilicord-related bleeding after birth has increased&#13;
from 32 cases in 1991 to 79 cases in 1994. This condition is associated with the high&#13;
salinity and nitrate content of drinking water.&#13;
(b)    For women of reproductive age, the morbidity rate of anemia has increased from&#13;
79 % in 1989 to 99 % in 1993.&#13;
*      In addition to its impact on human health, poor water quality in the project area adversely&#13;
affects the health of livestock. Although other factors also constrain agricultural production&#13;
(for example, inaccessible markets and low prices in relation to production costs), poor&#13;
water quality and availability also constrain the production of livestock and related&#13;
products. The main impacts of the inadequate water supply on animal health are:&#13;
(a)    The high salinity content of the shallow ground-water wells, which are the main&#13;
source of drinking water for livestock, appears to cause them to suffer from&#13;
salt-poisoning, kidney disease, and increased mortality rates. For example, sheep&#13;
mortality rate has increased almost threefold from 136 per thousand cases in 1993&#13;
to 382 per thousand cases in 1994.&#13;
(b)    The high nitrate content of the water from the Syr Darya River (Kazalinsk District)&#13;
is causing a reduction in hemoglobin in the blood (anemia), which weakens the&#13;
immune system of animals and ultimately may cause death. The high content of&#13;
nitrate also causes a lower rate of weight gain, thyroid dysfunction, arthritic&#13;
conditions, and miscarriages. In addition, statistical data show that the number of&#13;
livestock deaths related to metabolism malfunctioning has increased from 6,000 to&#13;
14,000 between 1993 and 1994.&#13;

5.       In the agricultural sector, the shortage of water (and its high cost) poses a severe constraint on&#13;
livestock production and productivity. Seventy-one % of the household survey respondents said they would&#13;
raise more animals if they had more water, regardless of quality. Direcf.ors of several state farmns have&#13;
reported that due to the high cost of water (water from the Aralsk-Sarbulak pipeliine is charged at 17 Tenge&#13;
per cubic meter for livestock purposes, 8.5 times the domestic tariff), onlv half of the total available area for&#13;
grazing is being used. In Kazalinsk, both water quality and quantity limit animal production and constrain&#13;
productivity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
6.    The non-agricultural industries surveyed are declining in both project areas, but the respondents did&#13;
not cite an inadequate water supply as a principal constraint to production. The real constraints are: lack of&#13;
liquidity has left enterprises without cash for purchasing needed inputs, limited access to commercial loans&#13;
due to high interest rates, shortage of gas and fuel, high taxes, and the loss of skilled labor due to&#13;
emigration. While the phasing out of price distortions for inputs such as water and heat also was mentioned,&#13;
the nature of the water supply per se was not identified as a key constraint to production, although rising&#13;
water costs clearly are a problem, which enterprises are trying to avoid.&#13;
7.     Despite their limited access to an adequate water supply, only 14 % of the household survey&#13;
respondents mentioned water quality as their most important problem; and 9 % mentioned water shortage.&#13;
The poor water quality response was more frequent in rural settlements (20 %) than in district centers (5 %)&#13;
and more prevalent in Kazalinsk (19 %) than in Aralsk (10 %). Most respondents mentioned four other&#13;
pressing problems more frequently as their first priority: shortage of money to buy food (75 %); wages and&#13;
pensions not being paid (51 %); lack of gas, coal or wood for heating (41 %); and shortage of flour (25 %).&#13;
8.    Water conditions are more severe in Kazalinsk than in Aralsk. In the household survey, water&#13;
problems were named more often in Kazalinsk (28 %) than in Aralsk (19 %). And poor water quality was&#13;
identified twice as often in Kazalinsk than in Aralsk, indicating that the population of Aralsk uses the&#13;
high-quality water coming from the Aralsk-Sarbulak Pipeline, while most Kazalinsk residents consume&#13;
unpurified water from the Syr-Darya River. In addition, the shortage of flour was mentioned more often in&#13;
Kazalinsk (36 %) than in Aralsk (14 %). In the latter district, a mechanical bakery subsidized by the&#13;
regional administration causes retail bread prices in Aralsk to be half those in Kazalinsk. Because most&#13;
people in Kazalinsk bake their own bread, they are more affected by the flour problem than people in&#13;
Aralsk.&#13;
9.     To determine family priorities, respondents were asked how they would spend 1,500 Tenge&#13;
(US$24). In aggregate, the responses focused on things the respondents believe they could obtain&#13;
individually, rather than on needs that could be addressed only through collective action. Eighty-two % said&#13;
that, as their first choice, they would use the money to buy food. As a second choice, the most prevalent&#13;
response was to buy clothes and shoes (47 %), followed by the desire to buy livestock, poultry, and animal&#13;
feed (11 %). The most prevalent third choice would be to visit a doctor or buy medicine (20 %). The next&#13;
most prevalent responses were to buy livestock, poultry, and animal feed (20 %); visit a doctor or buy&#13;
medicine (20 %); and buy wood or coal (14 %). The fact that a substantial portion of respondents would&#13;
use the money to visit a doctor or purchase medicine confirms the low quality of free medical service and&#13;
high levels of morbidity.&#13;
10.    Water did not emerge as the most important problem, presumably because families are worried&#13;
about other new issues that are more pressing and require immediate attention to assure their survival.&#13;
Nonetheless, the household survey revealed that families are ready to pay an average of 2,865 Tenge&#13;
(US$45.48) as an investment to improve their water supply. Twenty-eight % of the respondents indicated a&#13;
willingness to pay a one-time charge of 2,500 Tenge (US$39.68) for a 24-hour water supply, and a monthly&#13;
fee averaging 241 Tenge (US$3.83). The one-time payment is preferred to repayment in installments&#13;
because it can be met by selling an animal.&#13;

Project Implications&#13;
11.    According to the household survey and enterprise interviews, improving water supply and&#13;
sanitation clearly are not the highest priority in Aralsk and Kazalinsk. Both households and enterprises in&#13;
these districts are more concerned about reviving the economy and improving general environmental&#13;
conditions. These findings, however, do not necessarily mean that water is not a problem. Rather, they&#13;
indicate that households and enterprises have developed strategies for coping with inadequate watel&#13;
supplies but not for dealing with other, newer major challenges, such as the lack of food. Meanwhile.&#13;
however, the conclusion that emerges from the va -ety of data sources is that poor water quality and&#13;
inadequate supply constrain both economic growth and family well-being in the two districts.&#13;
12.    These major findings lead to the conclusion that the project should have an income generating&#13;
focus to complement water investments. Improvements in the in water supply systems in the area,&#13;
therefore, should be implemented in a labor-intensive way that maximizes local employment and increases&#13;
access to yards to make it easier to increase livestock production and water home gardens as a means of&#13;
improving people's lives. Although the SA did not reveal a critical sanitation problem, the project also&#13;
should consider including a labor-intensive sanitation component not only to improve existing sanitary&#13;
facilities, but also to generate income.&#13;
13.    The rural areas in both Aralsk and Kazalinsk are the most disadvantaged with respect to water&#13;
supply and therefore should receive first priority for new water supply investments, particularly in&#13;
extending the piped water supply and providing alternative sources to communities that would be too costly&#13;
to link to the piped system. In the urban areas, however, the problems of Aralsk and Kazalinsk are&#13;
somewhat different, but both require improvements in the existing water supply system. In Aralsk, for&#13;
example, where only 20 of the 54 piped water tap stands are functioning properly, the project should focus&#13;
on improving existing facilities. In Kazalinsk, where the tap stands are more functional (out of 93 tap&#13;
stands, 70 are working), the main water supply problem is the poor water quality. In this district, therefore,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
the project would need to improve water treatment facilities to deal with excessive nitrite concentrations in&#13;
small systems and expand access to the Aralsk-Sarbulak Pipeline.&#13;
14.   Informal interviews and focus group discussions suggest that traditional ties between neighbors and&#13;
extended family members are still strong, as demonstrated by patterns of sharing and mutual assistance,&#13;
particularly in rural areas. The project, therefore, should strengthen this tradition by fostering community&#13;
participation in designing, implementing, and carrying out operations and maintenance responsibilities for&#13;
the water systems and sanitation improvements. This process should be developed directly in the&#13;
community, enabling community leaders to assume responsibility for organizing and building consensus.&#13;
In addition, these participatory approaches should be implemented through pilot projects as soon as possible&#13;
not only to test new approaches and obtain their immediate benefits, but also to demonstrate the&#13;
commitment of the Government and other outside agencies to improve conditions in the area.&#13;
15.    Finally, the project preparation process should consider additional investments in the area that&#13;
could generate income. For example, the project might support investments in desert forestry (for example,&#13;
Saksaul trees) and assistance to help migrants establish themselves in other locations. Such assistance may&#13;
include providing seed money for starting new enterprises or covering the costs of resettling families.&#13;
16.    These findings and implications were discussed at a Stakeholder Workshop which endorsed the&#13;
project approach, as well as the need to move quickly to initiate pilot activities to gain credibility and foster&#13;
local ownership.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
REPUBLIC OF KAZAKSTAN&#13;
PILOT WATER SUPPLY PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
1.    Justifcation of the Project: The main objective of the investment component of this project is&#13;
to make emergency physical improvements to the piped water supply system aiming to improve the&#13;
quality and quantity of services to existing consumers.&#13;
2.    Two issues that would affect the sustainability of the investment are: (i) the poor financial&#13;
viability of the water utilities operating in the project area; and (ii) the lack of an institutional framework.&#13;
These issues are beyond the objective of the proposed project, but would be fully addressed under the&#13;
full-scale project. This pilot project would, however, create some desirable conditions for the next phase.&#13;
3.    The project design is limited to the most urgent works leading to significant improvements in the&#13;
utilization of existing assets and facilities, particularly the rehabilitation of the Sarbulak pipeline&#13;
undertaken by USAID, and bring them into productive use. As explained earlier, the USAID-funded&#13;
project has improved and upgraded the Sarbulak pipeline, but because of limited funding, both the&#13;
repairs of leakage in the transmission main and distribution systems, and the completion of the&#13;
Novokazalinsk Pump Station were cut off from their program.&#13;
4.    The immediate impacts of the project would be as follows:&#13;
*  More efficient use of water, increased quantity and reliability of water supply as a&#13;
consequence of rehabilitation works, and reductions in leakage in existing distribution&#13;
networks and the main transmission pipeline.&#13;
*  Improved water quality in Novokazalinsk Rayon as a result of the completion of Pumping&#13;
Station No 7, leading to improved public health of the population already connected to the&#13;
city network..&#13;
5.    Economic Costs. For the economic analysis, 22% of the project expenditures of the PIU&#13;
component were excluded from the cost31. All costs were expressed in constant prices as of April 1996.&#13;
The value added taxes and physical contingencies were also excluded from the base scenario. An overall&#13;
conversion factor of 0.9 was used to reflect the shadow price of skilled and unskilled labor.&#13;
6.    The analysis only included replacement cost for the pumping station, equivalent to 40% of&#13;
capital cost. No residual values were included in the analysis. Operation and maintenance costs were&#13;
3/    It is assumed that the cost of the PIU component is distributed between the physical investment component&#13;
and the detailed engineering study component in the proportion 78% to 22%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
estimated as follows: 5% of capital cost for rehabilitation works, and $0.17/m3 of water produced by the&#13;
new pumping station in Novokazalinsk.&#13;
7.     Economic Benefits. Benefits attributable to the project were identified for each individual&#13;
component. In the case of the rehabilitation of the pipeline, the analysis included the benefits of the&#13;
ongoing rehabilitation work undertaken by USAID, which basically consists of increasing production&#13;
capacity of the groundwater wells from 320 lit./sec to 520 lit/sec. This capacity would easily allow for&#13;
additional demand up to year 2020, if physical losses are kept at a reasonable level (12-15% or less).&#13;
Because of the high level of physical losses (about 45% in 19954/), additional quantities of water would&#13;
have to be produced at an early date to compensate for the losses in productivity. Since this component&#13;
envisages to reduce the level of physical losses from 45% to 30%, this would allow saving on production&#13;
costs associated with the excess production. Production costs per m3 of water were reported at $0.46 and&#13;
$0.76 in Aralsk and Kazalinsk Rayons, respectively. Assuming that 60% can be directly depend on the&#13;
level of production, the average operating cost or short-term marginal cost was estimated at about&#13;
$0.37/m3.&#13;
8.     Similarly, in the case of the rehabilitation of the distribution networks in the cities of Aralsk and&#13;
Kazalinsk, the benefits were represented by the savings in production costs as a result of reducing&#13;
physical losses from 40% to 20%5'. In this particular case, the short-term marginal cost was estimated at&#13;
$0.15/m3. This figure was obtained by breaking down Kazalinsk Vodokanal's production cost, and&#13;
includes fuel, power, chemical, and only 50% of labor cost.&#13;
9.     In the case of the new pumping station in Novokazalinsk, the possible benefits implied by the&#13;
cost savings to be gained by switching from vendors to piped water is an estimated $3.7/month per&#13;
6/&#13;
family . Table I1 shows the range of monthly household water expenditures under various assumptions&#13;
of interest rate and price of water from vendors. The improvements to be obtained with this project&#13;
component include increasing the reliability and the quality of water, which would eliminate the&#13;
necessity of having to buy water from vendors and invest in storage tanks to compensate for the&#13;
inadequacies of the existing system.&#13;
4/     If rehabilitation of the main pipeline is neglected, physical losses can further increase and reach levels&#13;
beyond 50% . The analysis incorporates this deterioration in the without project situation.&#13;
5/     If rehabilitation of distribution networks is neglected, physical losses can further increase and reach levels&#13;
beyond 45%. The analysis incorporates this deterioration in the without project situation&#13;
6/     The results of the Social Needs Assessment survey reveal that households in the project area are buying&#13;
water from vendors at an average rate 15 liter per capita per day. The average price of water purchased from&#13;
vendors is $1.1 per cubic meter, and includes the cost of water and the cost of delivery to the house. The survey&#13;
also reports that households have to build underground/aboveground concrete tanks to store water at a cost of $160.&#13;
Assuming an infinity life for the storage tank, then the annualized household expenditure to cope with poor or non-&#13;
existing piped water supply service is estimated at $3.7 per month.&#13;

Note: estimates based on a hypothetical 5-member family&#13;
buying 15 liters per capita per day and having to invest&#13;
$160 in a storage tank&#13;
10.    The aforementioned figure compares very well with the "willingness to pay" for improved water&#13;
supply services expressed by the surveyed households. On average, households were willing to pay&#13;
$3.83/month per family, plus a one-time cash contribution of $39.7 if piped water services were&#13;
improved, e.g., yard connection, good quality of water, 24-hour services, and reliable supply.&#13;
11.   Economic Rate of Return. The analysis assumed an average project economic life of 25 years&#13;
after construction, although the life of each individual component is quite different (35 years for the&#13;
pipelines and distribution networks, and 15 years for the pumping station). Cost and benefit streams&#13;
included only the incremental costs and benefits that would result from the project.&#13;
12.    The economic viability of each individual component was assessed separately. The internal&#13;
economic rates of return (IERRs) of each component and of the overall project, based on the&#13;
aforementioned assumptions, are presented below. Table 12 summarizes these results. The overall IERR&#13;
of the project was estimated at 15.9%.&#13;

Overall Project&#13;
13.    Three major risks that could jeopardize the successful implementation of the project and affect&#13;
its economic return were identified: (i) reduction in benefits because rehabilitation works would not&#13;
reduce physical losses to the levels proposed under this project; (ii) increase in costs because of&#13;
unexpected expenditures, and (iii) construction delays which may cause a lag in benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
14.   Possible benefit reductions were estimated on the basis that targeted levels of physical losses in&#13;
the pipeline and distribution networks would increase by 4%. If these shortcomings in the rehabilitation&#13;
7/&#13;
works were to occur, then project benefits would experience an 18% reduction&#13;
15.   The sensitivity analysis without delays in construction (Table 13) indicated that the IERR would&#13;
be 11.9% with a 18% decrease in project benefits. An increase in project cost by 18% would reduce the&#13;
IERR to 12.5%, while an unacceptable IERR of 8.9% would be obtained with a 18% reduction in&#13;
benefits combined with a 18% increase in costs. Given a 1/3 probability of each of these outcomes, the&#13;
expected IERR was estimated at 11.1%.&#13;
16.   The sensitivity analysis with a one-year delay in construction (Table 14) resulted in an IERR of&#13;
9.9%, with a 18% decrease in project benefits. An increase in project cost by 18% would reduce the&#13;
IERR to 10.4%, and an unacceptable IERR of 7.3% would be obtained with a 18% reduction in benefits&#13;
combined with a 18% increase in costs. Given a 1/3 probability of each of these outcomes, the expected&#13;
IERR was estimated at 9.2%.&#13;
17.   It is, however, unlikely that there will be delays in construction, since the management and&#13;
supervision of the project would be done by consultants, and its implementation supported by the PIU,&#13;
without depending on Government contributions (either in-kind or in-cash). The expected IERR was still&#13;
estimated at an acceptable level of 10.6% if there were a 25% chance that the project would be&#13;
implemented with a one-year delay.&#13;

distribution networks, and 34% physical losses in the pipeline, then the expected reduction in benefits is 9%.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Pilot Water
            Supply Project are to: a) gain experience in developing
            operational methodologies and capabilities in all aspects of
            project processing, cost recovery aspects, international
            procurement and contracting, project management, and project
            implementation under the same conditions as the full scale
            project; and b) speed up implementation of the full-scale
            project. The project consists of two components: a) a small
            scale investment component to finance a water supply and
            distribution pilot project as well as implementation of
            elements of the institutional reform action plan; and b) a
            technical assistance component for the review of engineering
            designs, preparation of bid packages and pilot project supervision.
