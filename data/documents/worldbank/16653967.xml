The authors would like to acknowledge the initial work by Fred Rosensweig, who developed the&#13;
conceptual framework for sanitation, upon which the conceptual framework for assessing the enabling&#13;
environment for handwashing was built. Further, we would like to acknowledge consultants (Mike Favin,&#13;
Carol Hooks, and Lynne Cogswell) and country team members (Nat Paynter, Nga Kim Nguyen,&#13;
Ousseynou Diop, Rocio Florez, and Seydou Koita) for their work in piloting the application of the&#13;
conceptual framework and methodology in Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam.&#13;

Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;Purpose of the Guidelines&#13;
This purpose of these Guidelines is to provide guidance to programmatic staff in the water supply&#13;
and sanitation (WSS), health, and other sectors on how to carry out an assessment of the enabling&#13;
environment for large-scale, effective, and sustainable handwashing programming. In early 2007,&#13;
the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) started preparations to implement the Bill and Melinda&#13;
Gates Foundation funded Scaling up Handwashing Behavior Change Project. The project tests&#13;
whether innovative promotional approaches can generate large-scale, effective, and sustained&#13;
increases in handwashing with soap at critical times among the poor and vulnerable in Peru, Senegal,&#13;
Tanzania, and Vietnam. As part of the preparatory work, the project carried out assessments of the&#13;
enabling environment for large scale handwashing programming in each of the project countries. The&#13;
assessments piloted a conceptual framework and methodology developed for this purpose by the&#13;
Scaling up Handwashing Behavior Change Project. These Guidelines present the background to the&#13;
study, conceptual framework, methodology, and tools used to carry out the assessments.&#13;
&#13;
The assessments have provided the teams in Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam with a&#13;
baseline of the strengths and weaknesses of their respective country enabling environments as&#13;
well as recommendations for how to bolster weaker areas. As the project moves forward with&#13;
implementation and related efforts to strengthen the enabling environment for handwashing&#13;
programming, we anticipate learning new and valuable lessons that may, in turn, help strengthen&#13;
the conceptual framework. As such, the project team sees these guidelines as a work in progress&#13;
rather than a definitive framework and approach to understanding or assessing a countries&#13;
enabling environment for large scale and sustainable effective handwashing with soap program.&#13;
The project team will continue to share our lessons learned in this area as we move forward and&#13;
encourage others to share with us their experience in using this guidance document or other&#13;
relevant approaches and conceptual frameworks.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to this document, Baseline Enabling Environment Assessment reports are available for&#13;
Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam. The reports detail the findings and recommendations from the&#13;
studies in each country. A synthesis of the findings and recommendations from the four country&#13;
studies may be downloaded from WSPâ&#128;&#153;s website (www.wsp.org).&#13;

Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;Background&#13;
Funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
follows the basic approach of the Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing (PPPHW), a&#13;
global initiative established in 2001 to promote handwashing with soap at scale to reduce&#13;
diarrheal and respiratory infections. 1 This approach draws extensively on lessons learned from&#13;
two large-scale handwashing promotion programs. Programma Saniya, implemented in Bobo-&#13;
Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, showed the importance of undertaking careful consumer research at the&#13;
outset of a handwashing promotion program. The Central American Handwashing for Diarrheal&#13;
Disease Prevention Program showed that an effective approach to changing hygiene behaviors at&#13;
large scale was to work with a broad partnership of public and private sector stakeholders that&#13;
have a mutual interest in increasing handwashing with soap, to focus on the one behavior with&#13;
largest potential health impact (handwashing with soap), and to promote it with cost-effective,&#13;
consumer-centered marketing.&#13;
&#13;
In hopes of facilitating effective replication and scaling-up of future handwashing-with-soap&#13;
behavior change programs, the Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project carries out a structured&#13;
learning and dissemination process to develop and share evidence, practical knowledge, and tools.&#13;
&#13;
Specific project objectives are to:&#13;
&#13;
1. Design and support the implementation of innovative, large-scale, sustainable handwashing&#13;
   programs in four diverse countries (Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam);&#13;
2. Document and learn about the impact and sustainability of innovative, large-scale&#13;
   handwashing programs;&#13;
3. Learn about the most effective and sustainable approaches to triggering, scaling-up, and&#13;
   sustaining handwashing behaviors;&#13;
4. Promote and enable the adoption of effective handwashing programs in other countries and&#13;
   position handwashing as a global public health priority through the translation of results and&#13;
   lessons learned into effective advocacy and applied knowledge and communication products.&#13;
&#13;
The project is designed to achieve key targets in each country at the end of two years of&#13;
implementation. The specific handwashing targets for each country are in Table 2. The target&#13;
audience is defined as poor women of childbearing age (15â&#128;&#147;49) and poor children ages 5â&#128;&#147;9.&#13;

Rationale for Enabling Environment Assessment&#13;
As part of project preparation, the Scaling up Handwashing Behavior Change Project carried out&#13;
an assessment of the enabling environment for handwashing programming in each of the four&#13;
countries. It is essential that certain factors and elements be in place to facilitate the success of&#13;
the sustainability and scalability of handwashing programs. These enabling environment factors&#13;
can ensure that handwashing programs have the desired impact, achieve the desired outcomes,&#13;
follow an efficient and effective process, and can be scaled up and sustained. The enabling&#13;
environment assessments were designed and carried out, therefore, to examine the extent to&#13;
which these factors and elements were in place in each of the four project countries and what&#13;
might need to be put in place to create the foundation for sustainability and scalability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Scalability and Sustainability&#13;
The ultimate question in any public health practice program is how can the health behaviorâ&#128;&#148;in&#13;
this case HWWSâ&#128;&#148;be scaled up and sustained once an externally funded project is over? It&#13;
should be clearly noted that scalability and sustainability have not, historically, been possible&#13;
without some initial investments in products, training, capacity-building, structure reinforcement,&#13;
communication skills, and so on. Ensuring and promoting scalability and sustainability requires&#13;
an examination of the contextual settingâ&#128;&#148;that is, political course, networks, and existing&#13;
structures, as well as programmatic conditions such as institutional capacity, availability of&#13;
financing, and behavioral requisites such as availability of all the needed products and materials&#13;
to practice the behavior, and the ability and willingness of the population to use these. 2&#13;
&#13;
To place the enabling environment baseline assessments in context, it is important to understand&#13;
the use of the terms scalability and sustainability as they relate to creating, supporting, and&#13;
maintaining a programmatic and behavioral enabling environment. For purposes of the&#13;
assessments, the following definitions were used:&#13;
â&#128;¢ Sustainability is the ability of a country, with minimal or no outside financial or technical&#13;
    assistance, to continue the work needed to (1) encourage and maintain a health&#13;
    concept/practice, (2) increase and maintain the number of people using or practicing&#13;
    promoted program behaviors, and (3) implement the program(s) needed to accomplish&#13;
    encouragement, maintenance, and increase. 3&#13;
â&#128;¢ Scalability is increasing the present scale and rate of behavior change. It is moving a&#13;
    program, practice, or methodology use and application from a small scaleâ&#128;&#148;that is, a few&#13;
    regions, a few villages, or several districts, reaching a small portion of the&#13;
    population/potential target audience, to large scaleâ&#128;&#148;that is, national coverage, the majority&#13;
    of the districts or villages, reaching the majority of the population/potential target audience. 4&#13;

Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;Assessment Methodology&#13;
In order to ensure consistency in the assessment findings, the WSP developed a conceptual&#13;
framework for assessing scalability and sustainability. The framework was developed based on a&#13;
review of relevant literature and discussions with key individuals. It was subsequently applied in&#13;
Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam with the objective of establishing a baseline for the&#13;
enabling environment against which each the four project countries can be measured in the future.&#13;
This exercise will eventually lead to a set of recommendations related to strengthening the&#13;
enabling environment for large-scale, effective, and sustainable handwashing programming.&#13;
&#13;
Dimension Descriptions&#13;
The framework comprises nine dimensions that are considered essential to scaling up a&#13;
handwashing-with-soap behavior change program.&#13;
&#13;
Policy, Strategy, and Direction: Establishing a shared vision and strategy and ensuring the&#13;
political will to implement them is the starting point for scale up. Without political will and a&#13;
shared vision and strategy among stakeholders at all levels, scale up will remain an elusive goal.&#13;
Developing this shared vision and strategy in a collaborative manner is also the foundation for&#13;
coordination and for creating motivation all levels.&#13;
&#13;
Partnerships: This handwashing-with-soap program model is based on a establishing a public-&#13;
private partnership. A partnership is a relationship where two or more parties, having compatible&#13;
goals, form an agreement to share the work, share the risk, share the power, and share the results&#13;
or proceeds. Partnerships need to be built at all levels among public, private, and NGO sectors&#13;
and between communities and local governments.&#13;
&#13;
Institutional Arrangements: Institutions at all levels must clearly understand their roles,&#13;
responsibilities, and authority. They must also have the resources to carry out their roles. In&#13;
addition to clear roles and responsibilities, institutional arrangements must include the&#13;
mechanisms for actors at all levels to coordinate their activities.&#13;
&#13;
Program Methodology: Handwashing-with-soap programs have a seven-step program&#13;
methodology. This methodology, adapted to each country context, should be clear and agreed&#13;
upon by all key stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Capacity: In addition to clearly defined institutional roles and responsibilities,&#13;
institutions at all levels must have the capacity to carry out their roles and responsibilities.&#13;
Institutional capacity includes adequate human resources with the full range of skills required to&#13;
carry out their functions; an â&#128;&#156;organizational homeâ&#128;? within the institution that has the assigned&#13;
responsibility; mastery of the agreed-upon program methodology, systems, and procedures&#13;
required for implementation; and the ability to monitor program effectiveness and make&#13;
adjustments.&#13;
&#13;
Availability of Products and Tools: A handwashing-with-soap behavior-change program is&#13;
predicated on the existence of the soap that responds to consumer preferences and their&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;willingness and ability to pay for them. In addition, handwashing station suppliesâ&#128;&#148;that is,&#13;
plastic basins, towels, and so onâ&#128;&#148;need to be easily available.&#13;
&#13;
Financing: This dimension is aimed at assessing the adequacy of arrangements for financing the&#13;
programmatic costs. These costs include training, staff salaries, transportation, office equipment&#13;
and supplies, and the development of communication and educational materials as well as&#13;
programmatic line items in budgets for handwashing-promotion activities.&#13;
&#13;
Cost-Effective Implementation: The potentially high costs of promoting handwashing-with-soap&#13;
behavior at scale make cost-effective implementation a key element. It is essential to understand&#13;
how the unit costs change as activities are scaled up. Although it will not be possible to assess&#13;
the cost-effectiveness of the approach and how best to achieve economies of scale until the end&#13;
of the project, data must still be collected during implementation to make this determination at&#13;
the end of the project. Therefore, this assessment will try to ensure that information will be&#13;
collected from the outset and that the capacity to collect the information is in place.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation: A large-scale handwashing-with-soap behavior-change program&#13;
requires regular monitoring and, perhaps more importantly, the willingness and ability to use the&#13;
monitoring process to make adjustments in the program. Effective monitoring will identify&#13;
strengths and weaknesses in the program methodology, implementation arrangements, and cost&#13;
efficiencies. Overall monitoring responsibility must be at the highest level of the program, but&#13;
must be based on information collected at the local government or district level.&#13;

&amp;#12;Study Tools&#13;
In the following, the tools used to prepare the enabling environment assessments are presented.&#13;
They include: Terms of Reference, Study Protocol, Source by Dimension Table, Proposed&#13;
Report Outline, Interview Guide, and Self-Reporting Questionnaire. A generic version of the&#13;
assessment tools is made available in these Guidelines; however, when carrying out the enabling&#13;
environment assessments the Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project adapted the tools to each&#13;
country context. We recommend that organizations and practitioners, who wish to carry out&#13;
enabling environment assessments, similarly adapt the tools to their programmatic and country&#13;
context.&#13;

&amp;#12;Tool A: Terms of Reference&#13;
    Enabling Environment Assessment and Baseline to Scale up, Sustain and&#13;
        Replicate Handwashing with Soap Behavior Change Programs&#13;
&#13;
1. Purpose of TOR&#13;
&#13;
The Water and Sanitation Program has recently begun to implement the Global Scaling Up&#13;
Handwashing Project with support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The project tests&#13;
whether innovative promotional approaches can generate widespread and sustained increases in&#13;
handwashing with soap at critical times among the poor and vulnerable in Peru, Senegal, Tanzania,&#13;
and Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of this consultancy is to carry out a baseline of the programmatic conditions needed&#13;
to scale up and replicate handwashing with soap behavior change programs. The baseline&#13;
assessment will be carried out during the start up period of the overall project or by July 30, 2007.&#13;
The baseline and final assessments in each country will be carried out by two-person teams&#13;
consisting of an international and local consultant. The consultant teams will be hired as&#13;
independent consultants but will function as one overall team under the direction of the WSP&#13;
Country Task Manager with support from the Global Task Team Leader for the Global Scaling&#13;
Up Handwashing Project.&#13;
&#13;
2. Background&#13;
&#13;
The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) is an international partnership to help the poor gain&#13;
sustained access to water supply and sanitation services. Administered by the World Bank with&#13;
financial support from several bi- and multi-lateral and private donors, WSP is a decentralized&#13;
partnership and operates through offices in Africa, East Asia, Latin America and South Asia. A&#13;
major thrust of the programs is to help its clients prepare for and implement actions towards&#13;
meeting the water and sanitation (WSS) Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In pursuing&#13;
their mission, WSP staff provides advisory support to projects and policies to help identify and&#13;
disseminate best practices and lessons from experience across countries, assist clients in the&#13;
implementation of pilot projects to test out new ideas and facilitate informal networks of&#13;
practitioners and sector stakeholders. Additional information about WSP can be found on the&#13;
program website (www.wsp.org).&#13;
&#13;
The Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project is working with and basing its countriesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
approaches on the Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing (PPPHW), a global initiative 5&#13;
established in 2001 to promote handwashing with soap at scale to reduce diarrheal and&#13;
respiratory infections.&#13;
The approach to handwashing promotion advocated by the global PPPHW draws extensively on&#13;
lessons learned from two large scale handwashing promotion programs: Programma Sanyia and&#13;
&#13;
5&#13;
 Global PPPHW partners include the Water and Sanitation Program, USAID, World Bank, UNICEF, London&#13;
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Centers for Disease Control, Academy for Educational Development,&#13;
Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council, Colgate-Palmolive, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Unilever.&#13;
&#13;
                                                    8&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;the Central American Handwashing for Diarrheal Disease Prevention Program. Programma&#13;
Saniya, a large scale handwashing promotion program implemented in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina&#13;
Faso, showed the importance of undertaking careful consumer research at the outset of a&#13;
handwashing promotion program. Lessons from the Central American Handwashing for&#13;
Diarrheal Disease Prevention Program demonstrated that key to changing hygiene behaviors at&#13;
large scale was to work with a broad partnership of public and private sector stakeholders who&#13;
have a mutual interest in increasing handwashing with soap, to focus on the one behavior with&#13;
largest potential health impact (handwashing with soap) and to promote it with a cost-effective,&#13;
consumer-centered marketing approach.&#13;
&#13;
This project will carry out a structured learning and dissemination process to develop evidence,&#13;
practical knowledge and tools for effective replication and scaling-up of future handwashing with&#13;
soap behavior change programs.&#13;
&#13;
Specific project objectives include:&#13;
&#13;
-Design and support the implementation of innovative large scale, sustainable HW programs in&#13;
four diverse countries (Tanzania, Viet Nam, Senegal and Peru);&#13;
-Document and learn about the impact and sustainability of innovative large scale HW programs;&#13;
-Learn about the most effective and sustainable approaches to triggering, scaling up and&#13;
sustaining HW behaviors;&#13;
-Promote and enable the adoption of effective HW programs in other countries and position HW&#13;
as a global public health priority through the translation of results and lessons learned into&#13;
effective advocacy and applied knowledge and communication products.&#13;
&#13;
The project is designed to achieve key targets in each country at the end of two years of project&#13;
implementation. The specific handwashing targets for each country are in the table below. The&#13;
target audience is defined as poor women of fertile age (15-49) and poor children ages 5-9.&#13;

&#13;
                Peru (28 million)           5,100,000                       1,300,000&#13;
&#13;
                Senegal (11 million)        1,970,000                        490,000&#13;

                million)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of this term of reference is to 1) assess to what extent the programmatic conditions&#13;
for scale up and sustainability are in place at the beginning of the project, and 2) on the basis of&#13;
the baseline assessment findings, recommend what should be done to address the gaps during&#13;
project implementation. (note: towards the end of the project period â&#128;&#147; in about 2 and Â½ years -, a&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;final assessment will be carried out to determine whether there is an enabling environment in&#13;
place in each country that can continue after the end of this project without external project&#13;
assistance- this TOR does not include the final assessment).&#13;
&#13;
The country specific assessments will need to respond to the country specific results frameworks&#13;
that each country is now preparing.&#13;
&#13;
The Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project has three distinct phases. Phase I is the six to eight&#13;
month start-up period for detailed planning at the global and country level. Several assessments&#13;
including a handwashing measures study and the baseline for the impact evaluation will be&#13;
carried out during this period. The baseline assessment of enabling elements will be carried out&#13;
during Phase I. Phase II is the two-year implementation period and Phase III is the three to six&#13;
month wrap-up phase that will include the final evaluation and dissemination of lessons learned.&#13;
The final enabling environment assessment will take place during Phase III.&#13;
&#13;
3. Conceptual Framework&#13;
&#13;
In other to ensure consistency in the assessment findings, WSP has developed a conceptual&#13;
framework for assessing scalability and sustainability. This framework was developed based on a&#13;
review of relevant literature and discussions with key individuals. The framework comprises&#13;
nine dimensions that are considered essential to scaling up a handwashing with soap behavior&#13;
change program.&#13;
&#13;
   (1)     Policy, strategy, and direction&#13;
   (2)     Partnerships&#13;
   (3)     Institutional arrangements&#13;
   (4)     Program methodology&#13;
   (5)     Implementation capacity&#13;
   (6)     Availability of products and tools&#13;
   (7)     Financing&#13;
   (8)     Cost effective implementation&#13;
   (9)     Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
In the following, the nine dimensions will be described in greater detail and key questions to&#13;
consider along each dimension outlined. The questions listed under each dimension are&#13;
illustrative, not exclusive.&#13;
&#13;
Definition of Scale-up: Increase the scale, rate of behavior change, and sustainability of&#13;
programs promoting handwashing with soap.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Policy, Strategy, and Direction&#13;
         Establishing a shared vision and strategy and ensuring the political will to implement it is&#13;
         the starting point for scale up. Without political will and a shared vision and strategy&#13;
         among stakeholders at all levels, scale up will remain an elusive goal. Developing this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 10&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;      shared vision and strategy in a collaborative manner is also the foundation for&#13;
      coordination and for creating motivation all levels.&#13;
&#13;
      Policy is defined as the â&#128;&#156;set of procedures, rules and allocation mechanisms that provide&#13;
      the basis for programs and services. Policies set the priorities and often allocate resources&#13;
      for implementation. Policies are reflected in laws and regulations, economic incentives,&#13;
      and the assignment of rights and responsibilities for program implementation.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
  Â¾   To what extent does political will to promote handwashing with soap exist at the national,&#13;
      state/provincial, and local government level?&#13;
&#13;
  Â¾   What are the best channels through which to influence policy relevant to handwashing?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Â¾   How have the key policy barriers essential to scale up been identified and are they being&#13;
      addressed?&#13;
&#13;
  Â¾   What are the institutional incentives at the national, state/provincial, and local&#13;
      government levels that support program implementation?&#13;
&#13;
  Â¾   Which organizations, individuals, or agencies could act as champions or catalysts for the&#13;
      program? What would it take to mobilize them successfully?&#13;
&#13;
  Â¾   To what extent is there a shared vision and strategy among key stakeholders at all levels&#13;
      that will provide direction and a basis for effective coordination?&#13;
&#13;
      Partnerships&#13;
      This handwashing with soap program model is based on a establishing a public private&#13;
      partnership (PPP). A partnership is a relationship where two or more parties, having&#13;
      compatible goals, form an agreement to share the work, share the risk, share the power&#13;
      and share the results or proceeds. Partnerships need to be built at all levels between&#13;
      public, private, and NGO sectors and between communities and local governments, etc.&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ What partnerships have been formed at national and local level? How are they&#13;
     functioning?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ To what extent is the partnership communicating, collaborating, coordinating,&#13;
     compromising, and combining to ensure coverage and overlap of hardware, promotion,&#13;
     and enabling environment aspects of Handwashing marketing? (At national as well as&#13;
     local level)&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ To what extent is there give and take in the partnership? (At national as well as local&#13;
     level)&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ To what extent is this partnership functional? What would it take to make it functional?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;   Â¾ To what extent are roles, responsibilities, and mutual expectations clear and agreed upon&#13;
     in the partnership?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ What effective partnerships between communities and local governments and NGOs have&#13;
     been established?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ Has the partnership fully explored all potential strategic alliances with public, private,&#13;
     and NGO sector organizations at national and local level?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ To what extent and how have partners integrated Handwashing into their ongoing&#13;
     activities and/or budgets? To what extent do they plan to do so?&#13;
&#13;
      Institutional Arrangements&#13;
      Institutions at all levels must clearly understand their roles, responsibilities, and&#13;
      authorities. They must also have the resources to carry out their roles. In addition to clear&#13;
      roles and responsibilities, institutional arrangements must include the mechanisms for&#13;
      actors at all levels to coordinate their activities.&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ To what extent are there clear implementation arrangements including well defined roles&#13;
     and responsibilities at all levels?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ What mechanisms have been established for national level coordination among relevant&#13;
     national partners?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ To what extent have mechanisms for inter-agency, inter-level, inter-audience&#13;
     coordination been established?&#13;
&#13;
       Program Methodology&#13;
      Handwashing with soap programs have a seven-step program methodology. A program&#13;
      methodology consists of the program rules, specific activities and their timing and&#13;
      sequence. Each country will adapt and apply the program methodology making it specific&#13;
      and appropriate to the country context. A workable program methodology that is clear&#13;
      and agreed upon by all key stakeholders is a key programmatic condition.&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ What evidence is there of a documented methodology? To what extent is there a defined&#13;
     and detailed program methodology for implementing handwashing with soap programs?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ How has the methodology been documented? How complete is it?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ To what extent is the program methodology widely understood and accepted by program&#13;
     partners and implementers?&#13;
&#13;
      Implementation Capacity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               12&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;       Clearly defined institutional roles and responsibilities are not sufficient for programs to&#13;
       operate at scale. In addition, institutions at all levels must have the institutional capacity&#13;
       to carry out their roles and responsibilities. Institutional capacity includes adequate&#13;
       human resources with the full range of skills required to carry out their functions, an&#13;
       â&#128;&#156;organizational homeâ&#128;? within the institution that has the assigned responsibility, mastery&#13;
       of the agreed upon program methodology, systems and procedures required for&#13;
       implementation, and the ability to monitor program effectiveness and make continual&#13;
       adjustments.&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ To what extent is there adequate capacity in social intermediation to facilitate community&#13;
     and household levels behavior change at scale?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ To what extent is there adequate capacity in handwashing promotion at national as well&#13;
     as local level?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ To what extent do existing promotional networks have the capacity and openness to&#13;
     adopt new approaches?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ What capacity has been developed at the appropriate level to oversee program&#13;
     implementation and monitor change at the community and household levels?&#13;
&#13;
       Availability of Products and Tools&#13;
       A handwashing with soap behavior change program requires â&#128;&#147; in addition to promotion&#13;
       of the behavior â&#128;&#147; that the product, price, and place dimensions of the Handwashing&#13;
       marketing mix are addressed. That is, target consumers ability to adopt the promoted&#13;
       behavior is highly dependent on the existence and availability of soap(s) that respond to&#13;
       consumer preferences and their willingness and ability to pay for them. In addition to&#13;
       soap, the Handwashing marketing mix may include soap, water, and other items, specific&#13;
       to each country situation, such as services to maintain Handwashing facilities.&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ To what extent are key dimensions of the Handwashing marketing mix, as identified in&#13;
     the formative research and other sources, being addressed by the partnership:&#13;
     Product: Are products (goods and services) which can act as consumer barriers and&#13;
     facilitators to handwashing considered in the project planning?&#13;
     Price: To what extent are monetary, time and other costs, associated with handwashing&#13;
     products being considered?&#13;
     Place: To what extent are handwashing related products available to target consumers?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ If the product, price, and place dimensions have not been addressed, what plans exist to&#13;
     address them?&#13;
&#13;
Note: Each country has conducted/will be conducting market surveys and market analysis in&#13;
conjunction with the private-sector partners. This assessment should not try to replicate these&#13;
surveys other than in fairly general terms. The dimension is included in the framework since it is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;a critical aspect of scale up, but should only be dealt with in this assessment in broad, general&#13;
terms.&#13;
&#13;
        Financing&#13;
       This dimension is aimed at assessing the adequacy of arrangements for financing the&#13;
       programmatic costs. These costs include training, staff salaries, transportation, office&#13;
       equipment and supplies, and the development of communication and education materials&#13;
       as well as programmatic line items in budgets for handwashing promotion activities.&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ What are the financing opportunities and willingness to finance among public agencies at&#13;
     local, regional, and national level?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ To what extent is there financing to pay for the ongoing programmatic costs including&#13;
     identification of the financing sources and mechanisms?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ How have handwashing promotion activities been included in national-, regional-,&#13;
     district-level budgets?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ How has the private sector partners contributed, with cash, and in-kind financing, or&#13;
     through their own-managed handwashing activities to the sustainability of the HW&#13;
     campaigns? What kind of a financial incentive exists, i.e. selling more soap, for the&#13;
     private sector to help to finance the programmatic and campaign costs?&#13;
&#13;
       Cost-Effective Implementation&#13;
&#13;
       The potentially high costs of promoting handwashing with soap at scale make cost&#13;
       effective implementation a key element. It is essential to understand how the unit costs&#13;
       change as activities are scaled up. While it will not be possible to assess the cost-&#13;
       effectiveness of the approach and how best to achieve economies of scale until the end of&#13;
       the project, data must still be collected during implementation to make this determination&#13;
       at the end of the project. Therefore, the focus in this assessment is to ensure that&#13;
       information will be collected from the outset and that the capacity to collect the&#13;
       information is in place.&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ Do program implementers at all levels know what information must be collected on&#13;
     program costs?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ If there are non-permanent, supporting programs on which this HW program depends, do&#13;
     the program implementers know what information must be collected to measure these&#13;
     supporting costs? (Costs of established programs â&#128;&#147; For example, with basic education,&#13;
     though it provides necessary support, it need not be counted, if it is unlikely to disappear&#13;
     during the life of the HW program. But if the HW program depends, for example, upon&#13;
     an experimental health course, which is only temporarily part of the basic education&#13;
     curriculum, its costs should be recorded for use in some of the program cost calculations.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                14&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;   Â¾ To what extent are the program implementers able to identify the size of the targeted and&#13;
     affected populations for each of the above programs?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ To what extent does the capacity exist at the local government and state/provincial level&#13;
     to collect the information? [The capacity includes the systems and procedures to collect&#13;
     the information, a focal point of responsibility including assigned staff, and the&#13;
     commitment to collect the information on a regular basis.]&#13;
&#13;
Note: It is not possible to assess cost effective implementation at the beginning of&#13;
implementation or without the results of the impact evaluation. Rather the focus in this baseline&#13;
will be to ensure that the systems and procedures for collecting cost information are in place and&#13;
that the capacity exists to collect it.&#13;
&#13;
       Monitoring&#13;
       A large scale handwashing with soap behavior change program requires regular&#13;
       monitoring and perhaps more importantly, the willingness and ability to use the&#13;
       monitoring process to make adjustments in the program. Effective monitoring will&#13;
       identify strengths and weaknesses in the program methodology, implementation&#13;
       arrangements, and cost efficiencies. Overall monitoring responsibility must be at the&#13;
       highest level of the program, but must be based on information collected at the local&#13;
       government or district-level.&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ What monitoring process at the macro level exists to measure program effectiveness and&#13;
     outcomes?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ To what extent does the capacity exist to implement the monitoring process? What&#13;
     institutions in public, private and NGO sector are present to conduct various types of&#13;
     studies (qualitative, quantitative, etc.) and what is their capacity (both in terms of&#13;
     technical skills or availability)?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ What other sectors have strong M&amp;E components and which organizations facilitate the&#13;
     process at different levels?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ To what extent is the process sufficient to monitor quality of services, identify gaps and&#13;
     weaknesses, and determine lessons learned and best practices?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ What technical, administrative or financial improvements or support are needed to ensure&#13;
     that the existing monitoring systems are adequate to support this program?&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾ What are the costs of any necessary improvements?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;The tasks in the scope of work are divided into three overall steps: preparation, baseline&#13;
assessment, and remote consultation. The international consultant will carry out all of the tasks in&#13;
these three phases. Most of these tasks are also the joint responsibility of the local consultant. A&#13;
summary of the specific tasks for the local consultant is provided at the end of this section&#13;
&#13;
Preparation&#13;
&#13;
Review key background documents including the grant proposal, country project design&#13;
document, and country specific policy and strategy documents related to handwashing that WSP&#13;
will provide.&#13;
&#13;
Participate in a 2-3 day team planning meeting with the Country Handwashing Task Manager,&#13;
the local consultant, and the global project handwashing technical director (if available) for the&#13;
baseline assessment of the enabling environment. The objectives of the team planning meeting&#13;
will be to ensure that the international consultant understands the background and objectives of&#13;
the assessment, have a good understanding of the approach and methodology for carrying out the&#13;
assessment, and finalize the structure and content of the assessment report.&#13;
&#13;
Baseline assessment&#13;
&#13;
Develop the interview protocols based on the conceptual framework discussed in Section 3 . The&#13;
conceptual framework is intended to provide a common approach to the assessment so that the&#13;
results are comparable across countries. Each dimension has a set of questions to be answered&#13;
during the assessment. The consultants will be responsible for determining what information&#13;
needs to be collected to answer these questions, how the information will be collected, and for&#13;
developing interview protocols.&#13;
&#13;
Work with the WSP Country Handwashing Task Managers and local consultant counterparts&#13;
before the field visit in each country to develop a work plan and schedule for the baseline&#13;
assessment. The meetings and interviews that are scheduled should enable the consultant team&#13;
to assess each of the dimensions in the conceptual framework.&#13;
&#13;
Carry out the baseline assessment of the programmatic elements required for scale up and&#13;
sustainability of a handwashing with soap behavior change program. While the specific&#13;
activities for the assessment will be determined by each consultant team, the assessment is&#13;
expected to include the following aspects:&#13;
&#13;
         â&#128;¢    Review of key documents (assessment reports, sector strategies, laws, regulations,&#13;
              etc.)&#13;
         â&#128;¢    Meetings with key stakeholders including government officials at the national,&#13;
              state/provincial, and local government levels; private sector providers of soap and&#13;
              handwashing supplies; NGOs, and donors.&#13;
         â&#128;¢    Short workshop at the local government or national level to test the validity of key&#13;
              findings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                16&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;Based on the results of the baseline assessment, formulate recommendations that WSP can&#13;
implement to create the enabling environment for meeting the 2009 targets in the Global Scaling&#13;
Up Handwashing Project.&#13;
&#13;
Debrief the WSP Country Handwashing Task Manager, and as appropriate, key government&#13;
officials responsible for the program. This is especially important since the intent is to use the&#13;
results of the assessment to address those programmatic elements that might be hinder scale up.&#13;
The consultant should discuss the recommendations and actions needed to strengthen those&#13;
elements that were found to hinder scale up with the WSP Country Handwashing Task Manager.&#13;
&#13;
Write an assessment report using a common format that is agreed upon in the team planning&#13;
meeting.&#13;
&#13;
Prepare an action plan based on the recommendations that WSP will implement under the Global&#13;
Scaling Up Handwashing Project. The action plan will be used by the Country Handwashing&#13;
Task Manager to address the gaps identified in the assessment.&#13;
&#13;
Prepare a short end of assignment report to be used to debrief the WSP Global Task Team&#13;
Leader for the Global Scaling Up Sanitation Project (TSSM) on the results of the assessment.&#13;
&#13;
Ongoing remote support&#13;
&#13;
Because of the length of time between the baseline and final assessment, the international&#13;
consultants should have some ongoing involvement with WSP.&#13;
&#13;
Provide remote consultation as necessary to WSP country staff and the WSP Task Team Leader&#13;
for the Handwashing Project. The primary purpose of this consultation is to provide guidance on&#13;
the implementation of the recommendations that result from the baseline assessment. This&#13;
ongoing involvement will also make the final assessment more efficient.&#13;
&#13;
Local consultant&#13;
&#13;
The local consultant will be engaged by the Country Handwashing Task Manager, but supervised&#13;
and directed by the International Consultant contracted by this TOR.&#13;

&amp;#12;Tool B: Study Protocol&#13;
A. HWWS PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
The Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project will be conducting this assessment in four different&#13;
countries - Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam.&#13;
&#13;
B. ASSESSMENT PURPOSE&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of this work is to assess to what extent the programmatic conditions for scale up and&#13;
sustainability are in place (the nine dimensions discussed below) at the beginning of this&#13;
project/this phase of the in-country program and based on these baseline assessment findings,&#13;
recommend what should be done to address the gaps during project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
C. ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES&#13;
&#13;
Specific assessment objectives include:&#13;
1. Determine what is presently in place/happening under each dimension.&#13;
2. Detail the level of the program to be carried out, i.e. pilot, expansion, national, etc.&#13;
3. Identify strengths and weaknesses of each dimension, with a focus on deficiencies.&#13;
4. Establish the baseline against which the enabling environment will be assessed at the end of&#13;
   this project.&#13;
5. Make recommendations for improvements to the enabling environment over the life of the&#13;
   project to the Country Task Manager, WSP HQ staff and main in-country partners.&#13;
6. Obtain consensus among current partnering organizations for recommendations and next&#13;
   steps.&#13;
&#13;
D. ASSESSMENT DIMENSIONS&#13;
&#13;
These Enabling Environment Assessments cover nine dimensions considered essential to scaling&#13;
up a handwashing with soap behavior change programs. This conceptual framework was&#13;
developed based on a review of relevant literature and discussions with key individuals. These&#13;
nine dimensions represent a conceptual framework for assessing scalability and sustainability.&#13;
Scale up has been defined as an increase the present scale, rate of behavior change, and&#13;
sustainability of programs promoting handwashing with soap or programs of total sanitation and&#13;
sanitation marketing. (Please see Assessment Methodology section above for a detailed&#13;
description of each dimension).&#13;
&#13;
E. ASSESSMENT DESIGN&#13;
&#13;
1. Data Collection&#13;
&#13;
Primary Data Sources will comprise main stakeholders/present partners for the in-country&#13;
program work, including but not limited to (this list will need to be finalized with the Country&#13;
Task Manager (CTM) and the local consultant), government agencies, international agencies,&#13;
international NGOs, local NGOs, private-sector businesses, and community-based organizations&#13;
&#13;
                                              21&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;(CBOs). These primary data sources will need to be contacted at all appropriate levels, when&#13;
needed and possible, i.e. national, regional, district, and local. As well, when it exists, the&#13;
WASH Committee should be an essential starting point. For the most part, all stakeholders&#13;
should be represented on the WASH committee, but if this committee â&#128;&#156;sitsâ&#128;? somewhere, this&#13;
should be determined and it should be considered as a starting point based on discussions with&#13;
the Country Task Manager.&#13;
&#13;
Secondary Data Sources will comprise document review and any potential influencers or&#13;
additional secondary implementers such as media, ministries with no direct involvement, etc. As&#13;
well, in those countries where program activities have not yet begun or they are in the very early&#13;
stages, consideration must be given to interviewing â&#128;&#156;potentialâ&#128;? stakeholders/partnering&#13;
organizations.&#13;
&#13;
The matrix below indicates which type of stakeholders should be interviewed on what&#13;
dimensions. Utilize your discretion as the interview progresses to adjust or adapt with whom&#13;
you discuss what dimensions.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      Stakeholder Type&#13;
                                           [unless otherwise noted, an X means that it is appropriate to discuss this dimension at all&#13;

First priority will be the primary data sources and document review, any secondary data source&#13;
interview and/or self-reporting will be as determined essential and as time permits. The first data&#13;
collection with secondary data sources should be through self-reporting (see Methodology&#13;
below) if possible. Attachment B contains a blank table to use to plan your interviewing&#13;
program. More specificity will be required within each stakeholder type, e.g. government&#13;
agencies would be broken down by ministry, MOH, MOHSW, MOE, MOW, etc. Appendix B&#13;
provides individual columns for this further specificity.&#13;

Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;2. Methodology&#13;
&#13;
Two qualitative methodologies will be utilized: (1) interviews and (2) self-reporting. Focus&#13;
group discussions will be only utilized if and when needed/appropriate. As well, document&#13;
review will be conducted.&#13;
&#13;
Interviews - Interviews will be conducted with all primary data sources who do not participate in&#13;
self-reporting. Interview questionnaires have been developed for each dimension and for each&#13;
level as appropriate (see Annex C).&#13;
&#13;
Self-reports â&#128;&#147; Self-reporting will involve the use of a grading scale questionnaire that can be&#13;
completed by primary and secondary data sources (see Tool F). It will be emailed, hand-&#13;
delivered, or distributed to other organizational representatives while you are there to conduct an&#13;
interview. Appropriate people will be asked to complete it and return it by the established&#13;
deadline (see sampling below). This self-report will allow sources to complete the questionnaire&#13;
on their own time. Self-reports also allow you to confirm and/or substantiate data gathered&#13;
during interviews or FGDs. Only a few of the self-reports will be interviewed as well (not more&#13;
that 25% of the self-reports should be administered to persons who are interviewed). This self-&#13;
report will be most appropriate for national-level representatives of the stakeholder groups.&#13;
While this self-report method could be used with others at other levels, it will be necessary to&#13;
determine how you can get the self-report questionnaire to other levels prior to considering the&#13;
use of this methodology with others. One proven effective method for distributing these self-&#13;
reports, is to ask a prominent member of the partnership/effort to distribute it via an already&#13;
established listserv, e.g. ask WaterAid or the WASH Committee to distribute with an&#13;
introduction email that you have written with a clear return deadline.&#13;
&#13;
Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) â&#128;&#147; While FGDs are not the preferred method of data collection&#13;
in this assessment, often when one person has been asked to participate, s/he invites other staff to&#13;
participate as well. When you arrive instead of a single person interview, you have a 4-6 person&#13;
FGD. To anticipate this, we have indicated appropriate FGD questions on the Interview Guide&#13;
(Annex C) with an asterisk â&#128;&#156;*â&#128;? to facilitate your work as it would not be possible to ask all&#13;
questions with a group.&#13;
&#13;
Document Review â&#128;&#147; Project documents will be reviewed prior to and during the course of the&#13;
evaluation as required and as deemed useful and necessary.&#13;
&#13;
Translations â&#128;&#147; It should be kept in mind that interview questions and self-reports might require&#13;
translation prior to use, so this should be scheduled into your calendar of activities.&#13;
&#13;
3. Sampling and Sample Size&#13;
&#13;
Sampling will be purposive for all primary data sources. Criteria for selection for both&#13;
interviews and self-reports will include: (1) have participated in HW program for at least 6&#13;
months OR be a potential partner; (2) represent a main workforce type - a decision-maker, an&#13;
implementer, or a mid-line supervisor/manager of the process/program; and (3) represent the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                23&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;different levels of the organization that are involved in the program, i.e. national, regional,&#13;
district, and local (as indicated needed on the interview matrix above).&#13;
&#13;
Minimum â&#128;&#156;idealâ&#128;? sample size should be:&#13;
a. One interview and/or self-report with each current partnering stakeholder at any level&#13;
   (primary data sources).&#13;
b. Three interviews in each dimension.&#13;
c. Two interview sets with two different present partnering agencies, within each of these two&#13;
   organizations, one of each work type.&#13;
d. One self-report set with two different present partnering agencies, within each of these two&#13;
   organizations, one of each work type.&#13;
e. Two interview sets with two different present partnering agencies with one representative for&#13;
   each level at three levels minimum, i.e. national, district, local.&#13;
f. One self-report set with two different present partnering agencies with one representative for&#13;
   each level at three levels minimum, i.e. national, district, local (items f. and g. could be&#13;
   combined).&#13;
g. Three interviews with three potential partnering organizations (if appropriate).&#13;
&#13;
Anything else reviewed, conducted, considered will be at the assessment teamâ&#128;&#153;s discretion,&#13;
depending on time and availability of stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
4. Analysis&#13;
&#13;
Qualitative analysis needs to be done on an ongoing basis identifying trends and patterns in&#13;
information gathered. As well, as needed, additional information will be gathered based on this&#13;
ongoing analysis to substantiate and/or clarify findings. Quantitative analysis of self-reports will&#13;
involve a simple totaling and averaging of responses, by individuals, by stakeholder types, and&#13;
by dimension.&#13;
&#13;
5. Assessment Team&#13;
&#13;
Each assessment team will comprise one international consultant and one local consultant.&#13;
&#13;
F. TIMEFRAME&#13;
&#13;
1. Time Period&#13;
&#13;
Â&#131; Three to four weeks are required for data collection and an additional three to four weeks for&#13;
  report writing.&#13;
&#13;
2. Sample Calendar of In-Country Activities&#13;
&#13;
The following calendar demonstrates a sample work plan for carrying out activities in-country.&#13;
It will need to be revised by the assessment consultant based on discussions with in-country&#13;
Country Task Manager (CTM), as well as the local consultant as well as based on the actual&#13;
length of each assignment (as mentioned in F.1 above).&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
G. REPORTING&#13;
&#13;
1. In-Country&#13;
&#13;
As can be seen from the recommended calendar of activities above, it is recommended that a&#13;
presentation of â&#128;&#156;draftâ&#128;? findings and recommendations be conducted before leaving the country.&#13;
This presentation should be accompanied by a brief handout focused on 1-2 essential findings&#13;
per dimension as well as 1-2 recommendations per dimension, if appropriate. This handout does&#13;
not need to exceed 2 to 3 pages. As at this presentation, after presenting short-, medium-, and&#13;
long-term steps, if possible, conduct an â&#128;&#156;action-orientedâ&#128;? session in which you address&#13;
immediately one short-term next step with the group.&#13;
&#13;
2. Assessment Report (see TOOL D for a Proposed Report Outline)&#13;
&#13;
The full assessment report should be started in-country during the last week of the assignment&#13;
while information is fresh. A FINAL full report should be completed within one month of in-&#13;
country work (two weeks to prepare draft report, one week to allow for review and feedback, one&#13;
week to incorporate feedback and finalize report for submission).&#13;

Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;1. Policy, Strategy, and Direction&#13;
Establishing a shared vision and strategy and ensuring the political will to implement a program is the starting&#13;
point for scale up. Developing this shared vision and strategy in a collaborative manner is also the foundation for&#13;
coordination and for creating motivation all levels. Policy is defined as the â&#128;&#156;set of procedures, rules and allocation&#13;
mechanisms that provide the basis for programs and services. Policies set the priorities and often allocate resources&#13;
for implementation. Policies are reflected in laws and regulations, economic incentives, and the assignment of rights&#13;
and responsibilities for program implementation.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1. To what extent is there political will to promote handwashing with soap (HWWS)and at what&#13;
   levels (national, regional, district, local)?*&#13;
&#13;
2. What policy changes, budget allocations, or program activities have people or organizations&#13;
   already taken to follow up on that political?&#13;
&#13;
3. What are the main policy changes, budget allocations, or program activities still needed now&#13;
   for a national HWWS program to be successful?&#13;
&#13;
4. Who are the key decision-makers whose political support is needed?&#13;
&#13;
5. What are the best channels for influencing policy relevant to a national program?*&#13;
&#13;
6. What are the key policy barriers to scaling up the program and how are they being addressed?&#13;
   (e.g. related to subsidies, availability of products, etc.)*&#13;
&#13;
7. What are the institutional incentives, e.g. financial, recognition, training, etc., at the national,&#13;
   state/provincial, and local government levels that support program implementation (in&#13;
   general or for HWWS)? What additional incentives might be needed?&#13;
&#13;
8. Which organizations, individuals, key opinion leaders, or agencies could act as champions or&#13;
   catalysts for a national program? What would it take to mobilize them successfully? These&#13;
   might include government units and programs, NGOs, CBOs, and for-profit companies.&#13;
&#13;
9. To what extent is there a shared vision and strategy among key stakeholders at all levels that&#13;
   will provide direction and a basis for effective coordination? What is this shared vision and&#13;
   strategy? Who do you see as the key stakeholders?*&#13;
&#13;
10. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this vision or strategy? What recommendations&#13;
    would you make to overcome these weaknesses? Who needs to act and how to do this?&#13;
&#13;
2. Partnerships&#13;
Programs are based on or promote the establishment of a public-private partnership. A partnership is a&#13;
relationship where two or more parties, having compatible goals, form an agreement to share the work, share the&#13;
risk, share the power and share the results or proceeds. Partnerships need to be built at all levels between public,&#13;
private, and NGO sectors and between communities and local governments, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        29&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;1. What partnerships have been formed at national and sub-national levels? How are they&#13;
   functioning (how well do they work)? If none, what is the feasibility of and/or the&#13;
   willingness to form partnerships?*&#13;
&#13;
2. To what extent is the partnership communicating, collaborating, coordinating, compromising,&#13;
   and combining to ensure coverage and avoid duplication of hardware, promotion, and&#13;
   enabling environment aspects of the program, its marketing, and its promotion?&#13;
&#13;
3. To what extent do partners actively participate in discussions and decisions?&#13;
&#13;
4. How would you describe the quality of the partnerships between district and municipal&#13;
   governments and implementing NGOs? How might they be improved?*&#13;
&#13;
5. To what extent are partnersâ&#128;&#153; roles, responsibilities, and mutual expectations clear and agreed&#13;
   upon in the partnership?&#13;
&#13;
6. How would you describe the working relationships between the NGOs and the communities&#13;
   with which they work? How might they be improved?&#13;
&#13;
7. How have partnerships fully explored potential strategic alliances with public, private, and&#13;
   NGO sector organizations at national and local level? How has the partnership fully&#13;
   explored all potential strategic alliances? What/who has been considered? What still needs to&#13;
   be explored?*&#13;
&#13;
8. To what extent and how have partners integrated HWWS into their ongoing activities and/or&#13;
   budgets? To what extent do they plan to do so?*&#13;
&#13;
3. Institutional Arrangements&#13;
Institutions at all levels must clearly understand their roles, responsibilities, and authorities. They must also have&#13;
the resources to carry out their roles. In addition to clear roles and responsibilities, institutional arrangements must&#13;
include the mechanisms for actors at all levels to coordinate their activities.&#13;
&#13;
1. What process has been/is being used to plan this program? Who is involved?&#13;
&#13;
2. How has the project/program been organized? Please describe the institutional set-up for the&#13;
   HWWS project in terms of the following institutional functions:&#13;
   a. setting policy&#13;
   b. developing program methodology&#13;
   c. implementation&#13;
   d. program coordination&#13;
   e. training&#13;
   f. monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
3. To what extent are there these implementation arrangements clearly defined?&#13;
&#13;
4. What implementation mechanisms are in place/being put in place? What methods? How are&#13;
   they being put in place?&#13;

&amp;#12;5. What mechanisms have been established for national level coordination among relevant&#13;
   national partners? How well are these mechanisms working? How might they be&#13;
   improved?*&#13;
&#13;
6. To what extent have mechanisms for inter-agency, inter-level, inter-audience coordination&#13;
   among different organizations and implementation levels been established? What ideas do&#13;
   you have on how to establish/improve them?&#13;
&#13;
4. Program Methodology&#13;
HWWS has clear program methodologies. The program methodology consists of the program rules, specific&#13;
activities and their timing and sequence. Each country will adapt and apply the program methodology making it&#13;
specific and appropriate to the country context. A workable program methodology that is clear and agreed upon by&#13;
all key stakeholders is a key programmatic condition.&#13;
&#13;
1. To what extent is there a defined and detailed program methodology for implementing the&#13;
   pilot program?*&#13;
&#13;
2. How has the methodology been documented? How complete is it? How useful and&#13;
   operational is the documentation?&#13;
&#13;
3. To what extent is the program methodology widely understood and accepted by program&#13;
   partners and implementers?*&#13;
&#13;
4. How fully/effectively has this program methodology been applied (program design)? What&#13;
   challenges have been experienced? What improvements would you recommend?*&#13;
&#13;
5. What kind of evaluation (if any) has there been of this methodology?&#13;
&#13;
6. What suggestions do you have for improving the program methodology?*&#13;
&#13;
7. Does the methodology need to be modified to be used at a larger scale? If so, how?&#13;
&#13;
5. Implementation Capacity&#13;
Institutions at all levels must have the institutional capacity to carry out their roles and responsibilities.&#13;
Institutional capacity includes adequate human resources with the full range of skills required to carry out their&#13;
functions, an â&#128;&#156;organizational homeâ&#128;? within the institution that has the assigned responsibility, mastery of the&#13;
agreed upon program methodology, systems and procedures required for implementation, and the ability to monitor&#13;
program effectiveness and make continual adjustments.&#13;
&#13;
1. Describe the capacity required to implement this program (at each level). (Skills, methods,&#13;
   tools, human resources)&#13;
&#13;
2. What resources are in place to support this capacity required? What is lacking?&#13;
   a. Financial&#13;
   b. In-kind&#13;
   c. Human&#13;
   d. Training&#13;
                                                       31&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;    e. Technology&#13;
    f. Other&#13;
&#13;
3. To what extent is there adequate capacity to plan and implement hygiene promotion in the&#13;
   government sector? What about among NGOs? In hygiene? In health promotion? Among&#13;
   other major stakeholder groups?*&#13;
&#13;
4. Describe a successful hygiene or health promotion program you consider successful. What&#13;
   made it successful?*&#13;
&#13;
5. How have for-profit companies (advertising agencies, etc.) been involved in hygiene/health&#13;
   promotion?&#13;
&#13;
Use ONLY if needed to probe further to help move the interview along:&#13;
&#13;
6. To what extent do existing health promotion networks have the capacity and flexibility to&#13;
   adopt new approaches?&#13;
&#13;
7. What capacity has been/is being developed at the local level to oversee this programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
   implementation and monitor change at the community and household levels?&#13;
&#13;
8. To what extent is there adequate capacity in the private sector to provide affordable goods&#13;
   and services and respond to consumer preferences? Will the private sector be able to respond&#13;
   to increased demand as the program scales up?&#13;
&#13;
9. To what extent is there capacity to oversee program implementation at community and&#13;
   household levels?&#13;
&#13;
10. When capacity in each of these areas is considered, what is it going to take to be able to&#13;
    implement this program at scale? (such as hiring staff, training, financial resources,&#13;
    motivation, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
6. HWWS - Availability of Products and Tools&#13;
Target consumers ability to adopt the promoted behavior is highly dependent on the existence and availability of&#13;
products and tools that respond to consumer preferences and their willingness and ability to pay for them. Any and&#13;
all required products need to be considered, specific to each country situation. [As countries have conducted/will&#13;
be conducting market surveys and market analysis in conjunction with the private-sector partners. This assessment&#13;
dimension will only be dealt with broad, general terms.]&#13;
&#13;
1. To what extent have the following dimensions of the handwashing marketing mix been&#13;
   addressed:&#13;
&#13;
    (a) Product: What HWWS products are available, where, and how? Products include soap&#13;
        appropriate for HW, water storage containers, water saving devices. To what extend do&#13;
        you feel that the products offered respond to consumer demand?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       32&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;    (b) Price: To what extent do poor people have the money to buy essential HW products and&#13;
        the time to wash at key times? Does the cost of products correspond to target consumer&#13;
        ability and willingness to pay?&#13;
&#13;
    (c) Place: How close to poor communities are essential supplies available? What supply&#13;
        chains have been established in response to household demand?&#13;
&#13;
2. If the product, price, and place dimensions have not been addressed (and at what level), what&#13;
   plans exist to address them?&#13;
&#13;
3. How would you characterize availability of products? What is the capacity of local soap&#13;
   makers? How could they be strengthened?&#13;
&#13;
4. To what extent is making soap at home common in some areas? How should programs&#13;
   promote the use of this soap for HW?&#13;
&#13;
7. Financing&#13;
This dimension is aimed at assessing the adequacy of arrangements for financing the programmatic costs. These&#13;
costs include training, staff salaries, transportation, office equipment and supplies, and the development of&#13;
communication and education materials as well as programmatic line items in budgets for program and promotion&#13;
activities.&#13;
&#13;
1. To what extent is there sustainable financing to pay for the programmatic costs of&#13;
   implementing the approach at present? (costs such as staff salaries, training, transport, etc.)*&#13;
&#13;
2. What are the financing opportunities and willingness to finance among public agencies at&#13;
   local, regional, and national level?*&#13;
&#13;
3. To what extent are you aware of the costs of implementing the approach? Which costs?&#13;
&#13;
4. To what extent is there financing to pay for the ongoing programmatic costs including&#13;
   identification of the financing sources and mechanisms for this present program?&#13;
&#13;
5. To what extent have promotion activities been included in national-, regional-, district-level&#13;
   budgets?&#13;
&#13;
6. How has the private sector partners contributed, with cash or in-kind financing, to the&#13;
   sustainability of the HW campaigns? What kind of a financial incentive exists, i.e. selling&#13;
   more soap, gaining market share, for the private sector to help to finance the programmatic&#13;
   and campaign costs?&#13;
&#13;
8. Cost-Effective Implementation&#13;
While it will not be possible to assess the cost-effectiveness of the approach and how best to achieve economies of&#13;
scale until the end of the project, data must still be collected during implementation to make this determination at&#13;
the end of the project. Therefore, the focus in this assessment is to ensure that information will be collected from the&#13;
outset and that the capacity to collect the information is in place - systems and procedures for collecting cost&#13;
information and capacity to use and collect it exist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          33&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;1. What do you think is the type of information that must be collected on program costs?*&#13;
&#13;
2. To what extent are there non-permanent, supporting programs on which this program&#13;
   depends? What type of information do we need to collect to measure these supporting costs?&#13;
&#13;
3. How would you identify the size of the targeted and affected populations for the program?*&#13;
   (give example if possible)&#13;
&#13;
4. To what extent does the capacity exist at the local government and state/provincial level to&#13;
   collect the needed information?*&#13;
&#13;
9. Monitoring&#13;
Large-scale HWWS programs require regular monitoring and perhaps more importantly, the willingness and ability&#13;
to use the monitoring process to make adjustments in the program. Effective monitoring will identify strengths and&#13;
weaknesses in the program methodology, implementation arrangements, and cost efficiencies. Overall monitoring&#13;
responsibility must be at the highest level of the program, but must be based on information collected at the local&#13;
government or district-level.&#13;
&#13;
1. What monitoring process at the national level exists to measure program effectiveness and&#13;
   outcomes?*&#13;
&#13;
2. To what extent does the capacity exist to implement a monitoring process at the national&#13;
   level? At the local level? What institutions in the public, private and NGO sector are present&#13;
   to conduct various types of studies (qualitative, quantitative, etc.) and what is their capacity&#13;
   (both in terms of technical skills and availability)?&#13;
&#13;
3. What other sectors (whoever you are not interviewing) have strong M&amp;E components and&#13;
   which organizations facilitate the process at different levels?&#13;
&#13;
4. To what extent is the (current or planned) process sufficient to monitor quality of services,&#13;
   identify gaps and weaknesses, and determine lessons learned and best practices?*&#13;
&#13;
5. What technical, administrative or financial improvements or support are needed to ensure&#13;
   that the existing monitoring systems are adequate to support an expanded program?&#13;
&#13;
6. What are the costs of any necessary improvements?&#13;
&#13;
7. What incentives exist to engage in and apply the results of monitoring activities? What&#13;
   might encourage programs to value monitor?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Tool F: Introduction to the Enabling Environment Assessment&#13;
&#13;
(Note: This handout can be provided to study participants to give them an overview of the&#13;
assessment)&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of this study is to assess to what extent the programmatic conditions for scale up&#13;
and sustainability of a handwashing promotion partnership are in place at the beginning of this&#13;
project/this phase of the [insert country name and project title]. During the next [insert time&#13;
period], a team of [insert number] consultants will be carrying out interviews with key national&#13;
and local level stakeholders in [insert country]. They will seek to assess the enabling&#13;
environment for the [insert name of program] in [insert country] along nine dimensions. The&#13;
dimensions are described below.&#13;
&#13;
The specific objectives of this enabling environment assessment include:&#13;
&#13;
   1. Determine what is presently in place/happening under each dimension.&#13;
   2. Detail the level of the program to be carried out, i.e. pilot, expansion, national, etc.&#13;
   3. Identify strengths and weaknesses of each dimension, with a focus on deficiencies.&#13;
   4. Establish the baseline against which the enabling environment will be assessed at the end&#13;
      of this project.&#13;
   5. Make recommendations for improvements to the enabling environment over the life of&#13;
      the project to the project management and staff, and main in-country partners.&#13;
   6. Obtain consensus among current partnering organizations for recommendations and next&#13;
      steps.&#13;
&#13;
As mentioned above, the enabling environment assessment covers nine dimensions considered&#13;
essential to scaling up a handwashing with soap behavior change programs. They include:&#13;
&#13;
Policy, Strategy, and Direction: Establishing a shared vision and strategy and ensuring the&#13;
political will to implement them is the starting point for scale up. Developing this shared vision&#13;
and strategy in a collaborative manner is also the foundation for coordination and for creating&#13;
motivation all levels.&#13;
&#13;
Partnerships: This handwashing-with-soap program model is based on a establishing a public-&#13;
private partnership. A partnership is a relationship where two or more parties, having compatible&#13;
goals, form an agreement to share the work, share the risk, share the power, and share the results&#13;
or proceeds.&#13;
&#13;
Institutional Arrangements: Institutions at all levels must clearly understand their roles,&#13;
responsibilities, and authority. They must also have the resources to carry out their roles. In&#13;
addition to clear roles and responsibilities, institutional arrangements must include the&#13;
mechanisms for actors at all levels to coordinate their activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                35&#13;
&#13;
Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project&#13;
&amp;#12;Program Methodology: Handwashing-with-soap programs have a seven-step program&#13;
methodology. This methodology, adapted to each country context, should be clear and agreed&#13;
upon by all key stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Capacity: In addition to clearly defined institutional roles and responsibilities,&#13;
institutions at all levels must have the capacity to carry out their roles and responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
Availability of Products and Tools: A handwashing-with-soap behavior-change program requires&#13;
the presence in households, schools, and communities of soap that responds to consumer&#13;
preferences and their willingness and ability to pay for them. In addition, handwashing station&#13;
suppliesâ&#128;&#148;that is, plastic basins, towels, and so onâ&#128;&#148;need to be easily available.&#13;
&#13;
Financing: This dimension is aimed at assessing the adequacy of arrangements for financing the&#13;
programmatic costs.&#13;
&#13;
Cost-Effective Implementation: The potentially high costs of promoting handwashing-with-soap&#13;
behavior at scale make cost-effective implementation a key element. It is essential to understand&#13;
how the unit costs change as activities are scaled up.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation: A large-scale handwashing-with-soap behavior-change program&#13;
requires regular monitoring and, perhaps more importantly, the willingness and ability to use the&#13;
monitoring process to make adjustments in the program&#13;
&#13;

            Guidelines for assessing the enabling
            environment conditions for large scale, effective and
            sustainable hand washing with soap projects
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This purpose of these guidelines is to
            provide guidance to programmatic staff in the water supply
            and sanitation (WSS), health, and other sectors on how to
            carry out an assessment of the enabling environment for
            large-scale, effective, and sustainable hand washing
            programming. In early 2007, the Water and Sanitation Program
            (WSP) started preparations to implement the Bill and Melinda
            Gates Foundation funded Scaling up Hand Washing Behavior
            Change Project. The project tests whether innovative
            promotional approaches can generate large-scale, effective,
            and sustained increases in hand washing with soap at
            critical times among the poor and vulnerable in Peru,
            Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam. As part of the preparatory
            work, the project carried out assessments of the enabling
            environment for large scale hand washing programming in each
            of the project countries. The assessments piloted a
            conceptual framework and methodology developed for this
            purpose by the scaling up Hand Washing Behavior Change
            Project. These guidelines present the background to the
            study, conceptual framework, methodology, and tools used to
            carry out the assessments. The assessments have provided the
            teams in Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam with a
            baseline of the strengths and weaknesses of their respective
            country enabling environments as well as recommendations for
            how to bolster weaker areas. As the project moves forward
            with implementation and related efforts to strengthen the
            enabling environment for hand washing programming, we
            anticipate learning new and valuable lessons that may, in
            turn, help strengthen the conceptual framework. As such, the
            project team sees these guidelines as a work in progress
            rather than a definitive framework and approach to
            understanding or assessing a countries enabling environment
            for large scale and sustainable effective hand washing with
            soap program. The project team will continue to share our
            lessons learned in this area as we move forward and
            encourage others to share with us their experience in using
            this guidance document or other relevant approaches and
            conceptual frameworks.
