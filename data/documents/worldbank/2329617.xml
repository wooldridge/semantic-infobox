&amp;#12;&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1. The June 22, 2002 Earthquake. An earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale struck&#13;
the four Provinces of Qazvin, Zanjan, Hamedan and towns of Markazi in Iran on June 22, 2002.&#13;
This resulted in 232 deaths, 1,466 injuries and more than 40,727 damaged houses. The&#13;
Government of Iran (GOI) estimates the value of the damages to be around US$257 million.&#13;
These refer to destruction of buildings, loss of household properties and commercial equipment,&#13;
as well as damage to social and public infrastructure, livestock and agricultural production assets.&#13;
They exclude losses in wages, production and sales, as well as the actual cost of the relief effort&#13;
and financial compensation. The data indicates that the greatest impact has been on the region's&#13;
housing and social infrastructure, such as schools, health centers, hospitals and cultural/historical&#13;
buildings.&#13;
2. Most of the population affected by the disaster is members of low-income groups who live in&#13;
mud-brick constructed houses, with limited means and know-how to build earthquake-resistant&#13;
structures. Other materials, such as bricks and cement, have also been used to build living&#13;
quarters without anti-seismic reinforcement.  The region's infrastructure also suffered&#13;
considerable damage, including the primary and secondary road network, transmission lines and&#13;
water and sewerage systems. The earthquake caused direct damage to livestock, agricultural&#13;
crops, deep wells and irrigation systems, rural roads, processing and storage structures, and farm&#13;
equipment, as well as assets of other input suppliers (fertilizers, pesticides).&#13;
3. Background of Qazvin, Hamedan and Zanjan. The provinces of Qazvin, Hamedan, and&#13;
Zanjan, which would benefit from the Project, are located in the northwest part of Iran and serve&#13;
as a bridge between Tehran and the country's northern and western regions, as well as the&#13;
Caucasus Republics and Europe. Highlands and mountains are the dominant geographical&#13;
features of the area. People engage in primary activities, such as agriculture and cattle rearing.&#13;
Qazvin, and Zanjan towns are important transit centers on the main route between Tehran and&#13;
Iran's northwest. The provinces are highly susceptible to earthquakes and a number of the&#13;
villages and towns in the area have been rebuilt in the past.&#13;
4. Response and Measures Taken by the Government upon June 22 Earthquake. The&#13;
Government formulated a two-stage strategy for responding to the June 22nd earthquake. The first&#13;
stage involved rescue and relief operations, while the second involved rehabilitation and&#13;
reconstruction efforts. The first stage was mobilized immediately after the event. The Ministry of&#13;
Interior and the Islamic Red Crescent Society took the lead role in relief operations and provided&#13;
stockpiles of tents and emergency supplies. All levels of government were mobilized within few&#13;
hours to deal with the disaster. Emergency services in adjacent provinces were also mobilized,&#13;
and the Government relief strategy focused primarily on providing emergency shelter to the&#13;
inhabitants of the affected areas. Potable water and basic sanitation facilities were also provided,&#13;
as were food supplies and clothing. Volunteers and staff from neighboring Provinces with&#13;
experience in earthquake recovery were transferred to the four stricken Provinces and started the&#13;
task of removing rubble from main roads, repairing key bridges, re-establishing power&#13;
substations, tapping temporary water sources, providing basic sanitation facilities and setting-up&#13;
temporary health clinics. During that stage, the GOI also received emergency relief support from&#13;
a large number of countries and international organizations including the Red Cross, The Red&#13;
Crescent and agencies affiliated to the United Nations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
5. The second stage of the Government's response has focused on reconstructing and&#13;
rehabilitating the affected Provinces. The Government reconstruction efforts were incorporated&#13;
into the exiting Guidance Plans for affected cities and villages. The main concern of the second&#13;
stage was providing permanent shelter to those inhabitants with severely damaged houses in the&#13;
fifteen villages that were required to resettlement prior to the advent of harsh winter weather. To&#13;
the Government's credit, this concern was substantially addressed by October 2002. Current&#13;
reconstruction priorities include the restoration of basic social and public infrastructure, such as&#13;
schools and health centers, potable water, sanitation, electricity, and telecommunications, and the&#13;
provision of economic opportunities to the affected population to help restore their income and&#13;
revive the local economy.&#13;
6. The GOI has already provided emergency reconstruction funds equal to US$40million under&#13;
the reconstruction program. These were partly allocated for housing credits to inhabitants of&#13;
severely damaged houses. The GOI funding covered also key infrastructure works such as potable&#13;
water supply and basic sanitation.&#13;

7. Donors' support. Aside from the in-kind support, which was available immediately after the&#13;
earthquake, donors' pledges of support have been relatively slow and modest. To date, German&#13;
Technical Cooperation has agreed to grant 0.5 million Euros for the reconstruction of six school&#13;
building complexes in the earthquake-affected areas of Hamedan Province. These activities are&#13;
expected to be completed by July 2003. It is anticipated that the Bank's support will leverage&#13;
donor interest in supporting the GOI's reconstruction efforts.&#13;
8. April 2002 Earthquake in Kermanshah. Subsequently, the Government has requested for&#13;
the inclusion of Kermanshah Province in the Bank-financed reconstruction program. Significant&#13;
parts of Dinawar and small areas of Humeh Counties in Sahneh Township were struck by&#13;
earthquake at 00:13 AM, on April 25, 2002, which had a magnitude of 4.8 on the Richter scale,&#13;
and again at 00:18 AM. The second earthquake had a magnitude of 5.2 on the Richter scale.&#13;
Aftershocks were felt at 07:01 AM (3.5 on the Richter scale), 8:33 AM (4.3 on the Richter scale),&#13;
and 12:25 PM (4.2 on the Richter scale). The earthquake's depth was reported to have been&#13;
approximately 33 Km, and damage estimates amounted to US$45 million.&#13;

B. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
9. Country's seismic risks and their impacts. Iran is known to be one of the most earthquake&#13;
prone countries in the world. With two major seismic belts, the entire country faces moderate to&#13;
very high seismic risks. O'ne runs along the Zagros Mountains in southern Iran, along the Persian&#13;
Gulf, while the other runs through northern Iran around the Caspian Sea. Earthquakes in the&#13;
northern belt are particularly hazardous as many people live in this region. This northern seismic&#13;
belt connects the tectonic activity in Turkey, to the west, with the on-going mountain building&#13;
and seismicity in the Himalayas to the east. In the 20th century alone, twenty large earthquakes&#13;
have claimed more than 140,000 lives, destroyed many villages and cities, and caused extensive&#13;
economic damage to the country. Table I below provides a snapshot of the eight largest&#13;
earthquakes in Iran from 1957 to 1997.&#13;

10. Recurrent earthquakes, which have broad economic and fiscal consequences, oln average&#13;
destroy over one percent of the national housing stock annually. From  1999 to 2001 alone,&#13;
government subsidies to homeowners affected by natural disasters were in excess of annual&#13;
average of US$1 billion, which amounts to 1.3 percent of GDP2. In the 1990 Gilan/Zanjan&#13;
earthquake, the cost to reconstruct housing, agriculture, energy, education, water supply, heath&#13;
and transport facilities, was estimated as US$990 million.&#13;
11. Vulnerability and future risks in the areas affected by the April 2002 and June 2002&#13;
Earthquake. The major vulnerability derives from the fact that in areas affected by the&#13;
earthquake, housing construction relies on traditional methods in which mud bricks are typically&#13;
utilized without structural reinforcement. These local construction methods have a poor seismic&#13;
safety record, particularly for low-income households,-and are a main cause of fatalities following&#13;
earthquakes in the region.&#13;
12. Poverty is another element of vulnerability. As indicated in the Human Development&#13;
Indicalors, the affected provinces are amongst the poorest regions in the country.  Agricultural&#13;
activities, the primary source of income, have been adversely affected, and the population is&#13;
deprived of its main source of income.  In addition, the remote access of these villages makes it&#13;
difficult to deliver materials and support needed for reconstruction of their livelihoods.&#13;
13. Furthermore, according to the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRIRCS), the affected provinces&#13;
have historically received less attention in improving disaster management capacities, as&#13;
compared to other earthquake areas, such as Gilan and Zanjan. Infrastructure needed to support&#13;
relief activities, such as relief centers for stocking goods and organizing volunteers, have not been&#13;
fully established. The June earthquake is viewed as an opportunity to boost the populations'&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
interest in strengthening the base for emergency response. The IRIRCS plans to construct relief&#13;
centers in these areas, and to provide a series of training programs for local volunteers.&#13;
14. Institutional capacity of emergency response and disaster management in Iran. Serious&#13;
attention by GOI to emergency response and disaster management seems to have emerged after&#13;
the 1990 RashtlGilan earthquake.  In 1991, the Consultative Assembly assigned formal&#13;
responsibility for disaster management to the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) by virtue of the&#13;
Budget Act of the same year. The Minister was delegated to deal with natural disasters, which up&#13;
to that time, were discharged by a special task force within the Office of the President. Also, in&#13;
line with the UN's International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, the Assembly enacted&#13;
the "Act of the Formation of the National Committee for Reduction of Natural Disaster's Impact&#13;
and delegated responsibility for implementation to MOI in 1991.&#13;
15. Under these legislative initiatives, MOI is responsible for developing policy, providing&#13;
guidance, overseeing supervision, and coordinating disaster management and post disaster&#13;
activities. These activities include coordinating rescue and relief operations, temporary&#13;
settlement and reconstruction with all respected government agencies. To carry out this function,&#13;
MOI established three main structures:&#13;
o   NCRNDI: National Committee for Reduction of Natural Disasters' Impact&#13;
o   NDTF: National Disaster Task Force;&#13;
o   BSCSR: The Bureau for Studies and Coordination of Safety and Reconstruction&#13;
Affairs, which serves as a coordinating secretariat for the above two structures.&#13;
16. These three structures with their national, provincial and local subdivisions are supported by&#13;
agencies assigned with direct executive responsibilities under the MOI's supervision, namely: (a)&#13;
the Iranian Red Crescent Society and Armed Forces (rescue and relief); (b) sector ministries&#13;
(reconstruction of each sector except housing);(c) Housing Foundation (housing reconstruction);&#13;
and (d) the Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology; (e) Natural Disaster Institute of&#13;
Iran; (f) Building and Housing Research Center; and International Institute of Seismology and&#13;
Earthquake (g) the Management and Planning Organization-MPO (budget arrangements of all&#13;
the reconstruction operations).&#13;
17. The experience of the Zanjan and Gilan Earthquake in 1990 served as a turning point in the&#13;
country's emergency response system, and relief and rescue capacity has improved considerably.&#13;
In three devastating earthquakes that occurred between February and May 1997, 95 percent of&#13;
people were rescued within first 24 hours of an earthquake, and all affected people were settled in&#13;
70,000 tents, which served as temporary shelters, within 48 hours. Ninety percent of electricity&#13;
supplies were recovered within 24 hours, and 100 percent within 48 hours of an earthquake.&#13;
18. Two shortcomings remain in the country's disaster management system. First, while the&#13;
emergency response capacity has improved considerably, it is not sufficient to respond to a large&#13;
earthquake or a natural disaster in large urban areas, like Tehran. Second, disaster management&#13;
and planning systems need to be improved, both at the local and national levels, particularly with&#13;
respect to preparedness and risk mitigation. Better inter-agency coordination on all aspects&#13;
(research and development, training and application) and all stages of disaster management&#13;
(prevention, relief, reconstruction) is needed to enable smoother transition from relief to&#13;
reconstruction, and to better prepare for future potential disasters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
19. In Summary: (a) the GOI's capacity to respond quickly to emergencies involving search and&#13;
rescue activities has considerably improved over the past decade, given its experience with wars&#13;
and previous earthquakes; and (b) institutional mechanisms have been established under the&#13;
Ministry of Interior for responding to emergencies. However, risk mitigation and preparedness&#13;
aspects of the disaster management systems need strengthening, both at the national and local&#13;
levels, including the enforcement of building codes, implementation of early warning systems,&#13;
and public education. This is crucial in view of the fact that Iran is prone to earthquakes, and&#13;
earthquakes have had debilitating consequences on the country's economy. Better inter-agency&#13;
coordination on all aspects (research and development, training and application) and all stages of&#13;
disaster management (prevention, relief, reconstruction) is needed to enable smoother transition&#13;
from relief to reconstruction, and to better prepare for future potential disasters.&#13;
20. Rationale for Bank's Involvement. The Rationale for the Bank's involvement should be&#13;
viewed in the context of Iran's vulnerability to natural hazards, and the Bank's international&#13;
experience in this area. Between 1980 and 1999, the Bank lent approximately US$8 billion for&#13;
post-disaster reconstruction, which brought about a broad consensus that the focus of the Bank's&#13;
disaster assistance should shift to reducing long-term risk and vulnerability. While floods and&#13;
earthquakes will continue to occur, it is in conjunction with the built environment that they turn&#13;
into deadly disasters. The Bank's focus on disaster prevention focuses on: (a) assisting clients in&#13;
implementing measures to minimize the likelihood of occurrence of natural and man-made&#13;
disasters; (b) integrating disaster mitigation into development efforts; and (c) building a national&#13;
culture of prevention and preparedness. Considering the Bank's broad international experience in&#13;
multiple risk and vulnerability reduction, it is in a unique position to assist the Government of&#13;
Iran through a comprehensive reconstruction program supported by a technical assistance&#13;
program on disaster management. It is expected that the Bank's assistance will serve as a basis&#13;
to draw the interests of other donors in assisting the Government of Iran.&#13;
C. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
21. The proposed EERP covers a portion of the overall government reconstruction program and&#13;
consists of: (a) housing reconstruction through the provision of building material, mechanical&#13;
equipment, technical assistance and construction supervision; (b) rehabilitation and&#13;
reconstruction of damaged social and public infrastructure mainly schools, health facilities and&#13;
water and sanitation facilities; (c) improving the economic opportunities of the population of&#13;
the affected areas; (d) project management and capacity building aimed at improving the&#13;
natural disaster management capacity in Iran and (e) setting the foundation for the preparation&#13;
in the future of a disaster insurance scheme in Iran.&#13;
22. T he total cost of the proposed project is estimated to be US$225 million, of which US$180&#13;
million would be financed from IBRD financing. The three-year Emergency Recovery Loan&#13;
would include the following components: (a) Reconstruction of housing, social and public&#13;
infrastructure; (b) Economic recovery for vulnerability reduction; (c) Capacity building and&#13;
project management; and, (d) Disaster Insurance preparation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Component-A: Reconstruction of Housing, Social and Public Infrastructure&#13;
(US1$72million)&#13;
Sub-Component A.1l: Housing Repair and Reconstruction and Purchase of Mechanical&#13;
Equipment (US$73m!llion)&#13;
23. This sub-component will fund: (a) the purchase of building material (US$40 million) for the&#13;
repair and on-site reconstruction of permanent houses; and, (b) the purchase of mechanical&#13;
construction equipment (US$33million).&#13;
Housing Repair and Reconstruction (US$40mifion)&#13;
24. The EERP will finance the repair of 15,232 houses that are 20%-50% damaged and the&#13;
reconstruction of 14.041 houses that are 50%-100% damaged. The EERP will only fund housing&#13;
repair and reconstruction projects that are in compliance with the following eligibility criteria:&#13;
o   Damage or destruction occurred after the earthquakes of April 25, 2002 or the earthquake of&#13;
June 22, 2002.&#13;
o   Household has already secured a loan from the HF&#13;
o   Project design and estimated cost completed&#13;
o   Environmental screening completed in a satisfactory manner&#13;
o   Local counterpart funds secured from Government or Provincial budget&#13;
o   Prior approval of MPO is secured&#13;
25. The EERP will promote the use of seismic resistant construction techniques in the repair and&#13;
on-site reconstruction of permanent houses. The Housing Foundation (HF) will procure in bulk&#13;
the building material for the repair and reconstruction of damaged houses. The cost of both&#13;
building material and construction labor will be met by individual house-owners who will use the&#13;
proceeds of housing loans to be provided by the HF. The latter will determine the amount and&#13;
allocation of building material to be procured under the project and will be also responsible for&#13;
the provision of technical assistance and construction supervision.&#13;

27. House reconstruction will be carried-out using three types of house construction models&#13;
(refer to Attachment 4). These will be determined according to the choice of the house-owner and&#13;
will depend on the availability of building material, the size of the house, the soil type and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

location. For Type-I and Type-IIl houses, the soil excavation for the house foundations and the&#13;
transportation and on-site installation of the steel frames for individual houses will be contracted-&#13;
out separately by the IHF.&#13;

Procurement of Mechanical Equipment (US$33million)&#13;
29. This sub-component includes the purchase of reconstruction equipment for the "Machinery&#13;
Bank Organization" (MBO) of the Housing Foundation. Equipment to be procured includes&#13;
machines for the removal of debris and rubble, site preparation, transport of construction&#13;
materials, plant equipment for the Housing Foundation.&#13;
30. Background to the "Machinery Bank Organization". The Machinery Bank&#13;
Organization is a holding company of the Housing Foundation. It was initially created to respond&#13;
to disasters and emergencies. It has since become involved in the construction of low income&#13;
housing in Iran and also for the operation and maintenance of 1,016 units of construction&#13;
equipment. Around 78% of the equipment used by the MBO is leased from the private sector&#13;
while the Housing Foundation owns 22%. The maintenance of the equipment is normally&#13;
contracted-out to the private sector and the MBO holds a stock of essential spare parts for a&#13;
period of 6 months. The MBO follows a procurement policy that relies on international&#13;
companies with local dealers that are able to secure maintenance and adequate supply of spare&#13;
parts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
Rationale for the procurement of new mechanical construction equipment:&#13;
31. Old Stock. As is shown in the tables below, around 96% of the construction equipment in&#13;
the central stock and 91% of the equipment in the provinces is more than 10 years old. Out of the&#13;
latter, around 50% are non-operational. This situation has resulted in low productivity during&#13;
emergencies in addition to high expenditure on operation and maintenance costs. More that 75%&#13;
of the MBO income is used for maintenance and repair.&#13;
32. Large Volume of Debris to be Cleared. The earthquake of June 2002 has left a massive&#13;
volume of building debris to be cleared from the affected villages. This operation will require the&#13;
extensive use of heavy construction machinery and equipment that is in a working order.&#13;
33. Lack of Accessibility to Building Material. Most of the affected villages are located in&#13;
remote mountainous regions. Access roads are poorly paved making the delivery of building&#13;
material (such as bricks, pipes, etc...) time consuming. Furthermore, distances between the&#13;
affected villages and the steel manufacturing and cement production centers are about l,000 km&#13;
and 300 km respectively.&#13;
34. Lack of private sector activities in the affected areas. Being widely scattered and located&#13;
in low-income and remote areas, the affected villages have not attracted large of volume of&#13;
construction activities in the past. Private contractors are not widely present or suppliers of&#13;
building material. This has made the cost of relying on private contractors for the removal of&#13;
debris, transportation of building material and reconstruction quite prohibitive.&#13;

35. Requirements of Machinery and Equipments.                Around 60%      of the equipment to be&#13;
procured under the EERP is destined to replace old stock while 40% will add to the response&#13;
capacity of the MBO in emergency situations. The newly procured equipment will be widely used&#13;
for reconstruction activities thus securing a steady income for the MBO. This, in turn, will help to&#13;
provide the necessary funding for the operation and maintenance of the equipment. It is worth&#13;
noting that the balance sheet of the MBO for 2001-2001 is in surplus and that during the last five&#13;
years, the MBO has been reporting net profits. Finally, a numerical model for the distribution of&#13;
the equipment between the various provinces is used by the MBO and relies mainly on&#13;
parameters such as population, size and number of projects.&#13;

Sub-Component A.2: Social Infrastructure (US$27million)&#13;
36. This sub-component will finance the rebuilding and repair of damaged social infrastructure,&#13;
such as schools and health clinics in affected areas. The social infrastructure will be reconstructed&#13;
according to sector standards and regulations, and the corresponding sector Ministry and/or&#13;
agency will ensure enforcement of these norms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
37. The EERP will only fund the repair and reconstruction of social infrastructure projects that&#13;
comply with the following criteria: (a) damage or destruction occurred after the earthquakes of&#13;
April 2002 and June 2002; (b) the damage already surveyed by the sector ministry or utility; (c)&#13;
project design and cost estimates completed according to sector specifications; (d) environmental&#13;
screening completed in a satisfactory manner; (e) environmental mitigation measures (if any) are&#13;
already incorporated in the project design; (f) local counterpart funds secured from Government&#13;
or Provincial budget; and (g) the prior approval of MPO is already secured.&#13;
38. EERP Support to the Health Sector. A large number of health and medical centers were&#13;
partially or totally damaged as a result of the earthquakes of April and June 2002. Engineers from&#13;
the "Organization for Renovation Development and Equipment of National Schools" of the&#13;
Ministry of Education have already inspected and surveyed damages to educational centers in the&#13;
four provinces. Urgent reconstruction and repair activities are required in order to restore and&#13;
strengthen the basic health services provided at these centers. Furthermore, considering that most&#13;
of the affected villages are far from major cities, and that the area is located in a disaster-prone&#13;
region, strengthening the capacity of health centers is of prime importance. Reconstruction and&#13;
repair of health infrastructure facilities damaged by the earthquake will further contribute to&#13;
government efforts aiming at reducing child and women mortality rates in the four provinces. As&#13;
shown in the table below, EERP financing covers a large part (75%-80%) of reported sector&#13;
damages and typical projects include the construction and equipping of: (a) health and medical&#13;
centers; (b) village clinics; (c) emergency units and; (d) the procurement of ambulances and&#13;
medical equipment for hospitals.&#13;
39. EE1RP Support to the Education Sector. The earthquakes of April and June 2002 and the&#13;
ensuing after-shocks have caused considerable damage and the destruction to a number of public&#13;
schools and educational centers in the affected areas. These are largely inhabited by a young&#13;
population and restoring access to education at all levels is a govemment priority. As shown in&#13;
the table below, EERP financing covers a large part (60%) of reported sector damages and typical&#13;
projects include the construction and equipping of a number of: (a) elementary, (b) secondary&#13;
and (c) high schools; (d) girl's boarding schools and; (e) replacement of instructional materials&#13;
and fumiture.&#13;
40. EERP Support to the Strengthening of Emergency Services and IKey Public Buildings.&#13;
This component will finance activities that will strengthen emergency services and upgrade key&#13;
public buildings that must remain safe during and after an earthquake. Typical projects include:&#13;
(a) the construction of a new fire station building in Hamedan and the structural strengthening&#13;
and; (b) upgrading of city hospitals, city schools, emergency medical centers, drinking water&#13;
networks and fire station buildings.&#13;
Sub-Component A.3: Public Infrastructure (US$72million)&#13;
41. This sub-component will finance the rebuilding and repairing of damaged public&#13;
infrastructure, such as water and drainage networks, telephone, power, road and electric systems&#13;
in affected areas. Similarly to sub-component A-2 above, public infrastructure would be&#13;
reconstructed according to sector standards and regulations. The corresponding utility or&#13;
regulatory agency would ensure enforcement of these norms. This component is expected to&#13;
generate temporary employment for skilled and semi-skilled laborers through construction&#13;
activities in the affected areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
42. The EERP will only fund the repair and reconstruction of public infrastructure projects that&#13;
comply with the following criteria: (a) damage or destruction occurred after the earthquakes of&#13;
April 2002 and June 2002; (b) the damage already surveyed by the sector ministry or utility; (c)&#13;
project design and cost estimates completed according to sector specifications; (d) environmental&#13;
screening completed in a satisfactory manner; (e) environmental mitigation measures (if any) are&#13;
already incorporated in the project design; (f) local counterpart funds secured from Government&#13;
or Provincial budget; and,(g) the prior approval of MPO is already secured.&#13;
43. EERP Support to the Telecommunications Sector. The telecommunications infrastructure&#13;
suffered severe damages as a result of the two earthquakes. Telecommunication centers were&#13;
destroyed, networks were severely damaged and communications were disrupted. The EERP will&#13;
support government efforts to restore telecommunication services and will finance the installation&#13;
of telecommunication networks in areas of new settlements built adjacent to the destroyed&#13;
villages. The project will also finance: (a) the reconstruction of damaged communication centers;&#13;
(b). telecommunications networks; (c) the establishment of BTS, BSC, MSC systems for&#13;
improving the telecommunication system in the affected regions; and, (d) the procurement of&#13;
equipment such as fiber optics cable, switches, etc.&#13;
44. EERP Support to the Water Sector. Access to water was severely disrupted following the&#13;
earthquakes of April and June 2002. Trunk mains and secondary networks were damaged and a&#13;
number of water wells, pumping equipment and chlorination facilities were fully destroyed.&#13;
Underground water levels decreased as the groundwater was diverted as a result of the&#13;
earthquake. The EERP will support the restoration of water supply to the affected areas and will&#13;
finance: (a) the construction of deep water-wells; (b) the repair and reconstruction of water&#13;
networks; and, (c) the procurement of pumping and chlorination equipment.&#13;
45. EERP Support to the Sewerage Sector. The project will help accelerate the implementation&#13;
of both on-going and new sewerage projects in the affected areas through the provision of&#13;
financing for the construction of networks and a limited number of sewerage treatment plants.&#13;
46. EERP Support to the Electricity Sector. The project will support the repair of the electrical&#13;
infrastructure damaged during the earthquake. It will also finance the installation of electrical&#13;
networks in areas of new settlements built adjacent to the destroyed villages. The project will&#13;
restore the power supply to affected areas through the reconstruction of low, middle and high&#13;
distribution and transmission networks.&#13;
47. EERP Support to the Road Sector. The road network has been the highest affected sector&#13;
resulting from the earthquakes of April and June 2002. A number of provincial rural roads and&#13;
poorly designed bridges were severely damaged. Also, the frequent movement of heavy relief and&#13;
rescue machinery has added to the road damage and severe cracks were noted on bridges and&#13;
rural roads. Restoring the quality of the road network in the affected areas is important to the&#13;
regional economy and the EERP will finance the asphalting and strengthening of key roads and&#13;
bridges in the region.&#13;
48. EERP Support to the Improvement of Local Roads and Street Infrastructure. Major&#13;
damages occurred to local roads and street infrastructure in the affected cities and villages.&#13;
Repairing that damage and restoring the rural and urban fabric of the villages and cities is key to&#13;
improving the living environment in the region. The EERP is an opportunity to upgrade the local&#13;
street infrastructure in the affected areas. This will be achieved by improving the, quality of local&#13;
roads such as asphalting gravel roads and streets, providing sidewalks in order to improve public&#13;
safety and implementing the key infrastructure projects of the village guidance plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
Component B: Economic Recovery for vulnerability reduction (IUS$36milliou)&#13;
49. To support economic recovery in the affected areas, a component is proposed to finance&#13;
investments in earthquake-affected provinces that would seek to strengthen the base for local&#13;
economic development. The component would reduce vulnerability to natural disasters by&#13;
improving the well being of the population. The provincial government will play a key role in&#13;
defining investments and in coordinating activities with relevant sector ministries.  The&#13;
investments, which would focus mainly on agricultural services and infrastructure, would be&#13;
selected based on the following criteria:&#13;
o Feasibility studies that are acceptable to the IBRD, and which meet sectoral standards.&#13;
o Satisfactory completion of the environmental screening process;&#13;
o An identified source of counterpart funds to undertake operation and maintenance&#13;
(O&amp;M) activities; and,&#13;
o Prior approval of MPO has been obtained.&#13;
Component C: Capacity Building and Project Management (US$13.7million)&#13;
50. Capacity Building for Disaster Management. This sub-component seeks to build disaster&#13;
management capacity both at national and local levels. Following on the institutional needs that&#13;
have surfaced since the 1990 Earthquake Recovery Project, the would support the Government's&#13;
efforts to address priority issues of improving institutional capacity in disaster management, and&#13;
in particular, strengthening preparedness for future natural disasters. Based on discussions with&#13;
the Government, and in consideration of the on-going initiatives of other donors such as UNDP,&#13;
strategic priorities to be addressed by Projects were agreed as follows:&#13;
o   Policy Review: Stocktaking of past national and local emergency response experiences in&#13;
Iran. An independent team of international experts would review emergency preparedness&#13;
and culminate in the identification of policy, institutional and physical interventions to&#13;
reduce catastrophic losses from natural disasters;&#13;
o   Public Awareness/Media Program: This activity would enhance national and local level&#13;
awareness of important preventive measures to minimize the risks in future disasters. The&#13;
activity would include: launch of a public awareness campaign on disaster preparedness,&#13;
production of short-films and booklets, and educational sessions for the public;&#13;
o   Training on construction and application of building codes for local engineers;&#13;
o  Training for local builders and the beneficiary population;&#13;
o  Training on the risks and vulnerability evaluation of buildings for local engineers;&#13;
o  Support for research institutions and laboratories for pilot studies, and to carry out analysis&#13;
and testing of earthquake resistant construction technology; and&#13;
o  Studies and research on earthquake preparedness and mitigation.&#13;
51. Project Management &amp; Consultfing Services. This sub-component would help finance: (a)&#13;
project management costs, such as staffing and equipment costs of the Project Management Unit&#13;
(PMU); (b) fees for project implementation to be paid to the Housing Foundation towards&#13;
managing both Component-A and Component-B; and (c) consulting services (firms and&#13;
individuals) to prepare feasibility studies, undertake design work, develop tender documents, and&#13;
supervise construction activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
Component D: Disaster Insurance Preparation (3.3US$million)&#13;
52. The component launch initial feasibility work to establish systems, a legal framework, and&#13;
training Iranian service providers. Under this Component, the following activities would be&#13;
undertaken:&#13;
53. Risk Management Study of Earthquake and Flood Exposures in Iran (US$0.5 million).&#13;
The study will quantify the earthquake and flood exposures of Iran to determnine the pricing of&#13;
catastrophe insurance and reinsurance coverage and the amount of reinsurance coverage needed&#13;
to protect the expected risk accumulations of the Iranian Catastrophe Insurance Pool (ICIP). The&#13;
study will focus on (a) analyzing the hazards; (b) collecting the vulnerability data on the assets&#13;
(housing stock and main infrastructure) at risk; (c) determining the vulnerability functions of&#13;
major assets classes; (d) modeling the expected Probable Maximum and Annual Loss. Besides&#13;
producing the data for developing detailed rating guidelines, the study will also deliver Iran&#13;
specific earthquake and flood models which can be used later on by the ICIP to determine the&#13;
actuarial cost of the risk in reinsurance placements.&#13;
54. Comparative Analysis of International Disaster Insurance Models and the Development&#13;
of an appropriate Natural Disasters Insurance Model for Iran (US$ 0.2million). The study&#13;
will review and undertake a comparative analysis of international disaster insurance models&#13;
and will develop an appropriate natural disasters insurance model for Iran.&#13;
55. Preparation of Natural Disasters Insurance Law (US$0.1 million). The nature of this&#13;
activity is to have an experienced international consultancy (preferably, a joint venture), assist the&#13;
government in preparing a credible Natural Disasters Insurance Law. In advising the government,&#13;
the consultant will consider the best international practices available in managing catastrophe&#13;
risks as well as the requirements unique for Iran. In particular, the draft law should reflect the&#13;
experience of the California Earthquake Authority, New Zealand Earthquake Commission, and&#13;
the Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool.&#13;
56. Study Tour for the Program Staff and the Key Government Decision Makers&#13;
(US$0.1million). The study tour intends to familiarize the program staff and the key Iranian&#13;
policy makers involved in the preparation of the program with the best international experience&#13;
available in the area of national catastrophe risk management. The study tour will introduce them&#13;
to the operations of the largest catastrophe insurance programs around the world such as CEA&#13;
(California Earthquake Authority), Florida Hurricane Reinsurance Pool, the Turkish Catastrophe&#13;
Insurance Pool and other relevant case studies. In addition, the Iranian delegation will be briefed&#13;
on the functioning of risk transfer markets, both reinsurance and alternative risk transfer markets&#13;
by major international reinsurers, reinsurance brokers and risk modeling consultancies.&#13;
57. Operational Guidelines, Rating Guidelines, and Policy Terms and Conditions&#13;
(US$0.2million). The consultancy is expected to result in the preparation of operational&#13;
guidelines, rating guidelines and policy terms and conditions for the ICIP.&#13;
58. In preparing the operational guidelines, a due consideration will be given to the envisaged&#13;
institutional design of the Iranian program under the draft Earthquake Insurance Law and the&#13;
operational design of similar programs in Turkey, New Zealand and the United States.&#13;
59. The preparation of rating guidelines will involve finding a right tradeoff between the&#13;
complexity of the rating structure and its applicability in Iran. At minimum, however, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
operational guidelines will reflect such individual risk characteristics of residential dwellings as&#13;
(a) proximity of properties to earthquake faults or river deltas;(b) housing vulnerability&#13;
characteristics such as type of construction, and age of housing.&#13;
60. The preparation of policy terms and conditions will consider the local insurance regulations&#13;
and practices.&#13;
61. Building Surveys/GIS Data-bases (US$o.5 million). The proposed study aims to develop&#13;
comprehensive data bases of buildings in major Iranian cities for the purposes of reducing the&#13;
processing time needed for issuing catastrophe insurance policies and thus for reducing the&#13;
program administration costs in the future. The study will result in the creation of Geographic&#13;
Informational Systems' databases to be used in the day-to-day operations of the ICIP.&#13;
62. Training of Building Loss Adjusters (US$1.0 million). Provision of insurance coverage to&#13;
millions of the Iranian homeowners will require the developed infrastructure for insurance&#13;
services. Swift, consistent and professional adjustment of insurance claims in the aftermath of a&#13;
major natural disaster is an essential prerequisite of a well-functioning national catastrophe&#13;
insurance program. Although numerous qualified civil/structural engineers can be found in Iran,&#13;
currently there are no professional loss adjusters for residential dwellings. The assignment aims to&#13;
create a national training program for the Iranian loss adjusters which will produce hundreds of&#13;
qualified Iranian insurance professionals trained in modern international techniques for assessing&#13;
residential property damages.&#13;
63. Advisory Services (US$0.7 million). Qualified local and foreign insurance professionals will&#13;
be retained under the insurance component to assist the government with the implementation of&#13;
the insurance component and to work on the preparation of the launch of the ICIP. These&#13;
professionals will act as a Technical Secretariat of the Intergovernmental Steering Committee on&#13;
Disaster Insurance, advising the government on key technical matters involved in the&#13;
implementation of the World Bank financed program and the launch of the national insurance&#13;
scheme. It is envisaged that the staff of the PIU will assume key management roles in the ICIP&#13;
once it is launched. This sub-component will finance the salaries of the professional staff (I&#13;
foreign insurance professional, 2-3 local insurance experts) and the overhead costs of running the&#13;
Technical Secretariat for 3 consecutive years.&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL AEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION:&#13;
SAFEGUARD&#13;
64. Social Aspects. The social impacts of the two earthquakes have been harsh. The proposed&#13;
Project would have a positive impact on restoring economic livelihoods through the provision of&#13;
housing and, basic social infrastructure. The main social concern is restoring peoples' livelihoods&#13;
as rapidly as possible. Since the August 2002 mission, the Government has completed the&#13;
emergency resettlement of inhabitants in the fifteen affected villages with its own financing.&#13;
Therefore, the Project will not involve any involuntary resettlement and will not trigger O.P.4. 12.&#13;
O.P. 4.20 on indigenous peoples does not apply because persons affected by the project are&#13;
neither vulnerable ethnic minority nor scheduled as tribal people within the provisions of Iranian&#13;
law.&#13;
65. Environmental aspects. The overall environmental impact of the proposed Project is&#13;
expected to be positive in that it supports the restoration of necessary social and housing&#13;
infrastructure in areas heavily damaged by the earthquake. Potentially negative environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
issues are primarily associated with the construction works, such as land clearing, disposal of&#13;
debris and worker safety. Safe water and sanitation facilities need to be ensured in the case of&#13;
school construction. To address these issues, and based on the best-practice models in similar&#13;
ERL operations, environmental screening criteria have been prepared and were agreed during&#13;
negotiations. The Government will secure adequate funding to screen and monitor the&#13;
environmental impacts during implementation.&#13;
66. The Project is rated as a category "B," which requires the preparation of an Environmental&#13;
Management Plan. Under normal Bank processing, official receipt and clearance of the EMP by&#13;
the Bank and public disclosures of the EMP both in Iran and the Bank's Infoshop will be a&#13;
prerequisite for appraisal. Given the nature of the operations (being processed under the OP 8.50&#13;
on Emergency Recovery Loan) and the proposed activities for Bank financing, an exemption has&#13;
been obtained from the Bank's senior management for any detailed environmental assessment by&#13;
appraisal. The Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework (including a mitigation and&#13;
monitoring plan) was drafted and discussed during negotiations. This has been compiled in a&#13;
Technical Annex and will be made publicly available in Iran and delivered officially to the Bank&#13;
prior to Board presentation. During project implementation, all proposed subprojects would be&#13;
screened to ensure that the environmental and social risks could be adequately addressed through&#13;
the application of the standardized guidelines of practice provided in the Environment and Social&#13;
Safeguards Framework.&#13;
MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE FOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
67. Directions on overall project management are provided by the NCRNDI serving as the&#13;
Project Steering Committee. The NCRNDI will make major decisions and provide advice on the&#13;
key direction of the project. The NCRNDI is chaired by the MOI and its membership includes&#13;
Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, Management and Planning Organization (MPO),&#13;
Iranian Red Crescent Society, most sectoral ministries and a number of research institutes. The&#13;
representatives of the provincial governments of Qazvin, Zanjan, Hamedan and Kermanshah will&#13;
be represented through MOI.&#13;
68. Reporting to the NCRNDI will be the newly created Project Management Unit (PMU), which&#13;
will solely serve the proposed project. The PMU is comprised of a team of qualified specialists&#13;
that will be housed in the MOI for the project's duration. Its main function is to carry out the&#13;
day-to-day activities of project management, serve as the main focal point in coordinating project&#13;
preparation and implementation with all entities involved, and prepare quarterly reports indicating&#13;
physical implementation data, as well as financial information related to commitments and&#13;
disbursements from the loan. The financial management specialist of the PMU will be appointed&#13;
by September 30, 2003.&#13;
69. Housing reconstruction under Component A The housing reconstruction will be directly&#13;
implemented by the Housing Foundation (HF), which will establish a Contract Management Unit&#13;
(CMU) comprising a project manager, a procurement officer, a liaison officer, an information&#13;
technology officer, an environmental specialist, and supervising officers. The HF will play a&#13;
central role in the procurement of goods and services needed for the housing rehabilitation and in&#13;
implementing the physical works. The HF will mobilize the affected communities and, with the&#13;
help of outside consultants, will prepare bidding documents and launch the procurement process.&#13;
Bids will involve the construction of structures without the finishing work. The HF will provide,&#13;
under separate competitive bidding, the construction materials, including frames for the homes.&#13;
For the finishing work of the housing units, the HF will facilitate and certify commercial loans to&#13;
each household in amount of approximately US$2,000 to US$4,000 equivalent. Such loans are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
provided in installments and require HF's supervision at each stage before subsequent payments&#13;
are made.&#13;
70. Reconstruction of social and public infrastructure under component A, and execution of&#13;
component 1B. The HF, through its CMU, will act as a procurement advisor in assisting the&#13;
concerned technical units of sectoral ministries and public utilities in each of the four provinces&#13;
affected by the project to prepare the bid documents and launch and evaluate bids. These entities,&#13;
with the assistance of HF, will also supervise their own work program.&#13;
71. Component C, implementationa of the technical assistance studies and training, will be&#13;
directly managed by the PMU in cooperation with research institutes and universities with&#13;
expertise in their respective fields.&#13;
72. Component D, the Disaster Insurance Preparation, will be carried out by a joint venture&#13;
of international and national consultants who will work closely with NCRNDI, MOEAF and&#13;
MOHUD, and the Inter-Governmental Committee on Disaster Insurance. The MOEAF has been&#13;
designated as the counterpart for the implementation of this Component.&#13;
CAPACITY FOR PROJECT IMPLEMlENATION&#13;
73. P1MI. Besides the Director, the team will be comprised of a financial management specialist,&#13;
Technical Coordinator, an Engineer, an Economist, an Office Manager and other support staff.&#13;
To strengthen their role as coordinator during project preparation and implementation, and&#13;
reporting requirement, the team members will be provided with basic training on the Bank's&#13;
procurement guidelines and procedures. The Bank will follow up, particularly during the first&#13;
year of implementation, the preparation of procurement documents for hiring consultants. The&#13;
MOI, where the PMU is located, has already had experience with the Bank during the first&#13;
earthquake project, which was completed in 1996. PMU staff employed in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's Consultant Guidelines may be remunerated from the proceeds of the Loan. All other&#13;
consultants will be remunerated from the Government's budget.&#13;
74. Housing Foundation (lF). The dominant implementing agency HF, which will handle the&#13;
bulk of the project funds under components A and B, was assessed during the appraisal mission&#13;
as to its organizational structure and its capacity to implement procurement. HF has extensive&#13;
experience in handling such activities, and has been active in natural disaster-stricken areas for&#13;
the last twenty years. It also worked with the World Bank during the earlier earthquake project.&#13;
For the past ten years, HF has coordinated the realization of 595,000 housing units in disaster-&#13;
stricken areas, or 75 percent of all houses damaged in various disaster situations. Further, HF has&#13;
been responsible for the villages' built environment, including streets and surface water drainage.&#13;
HF played a main role in rebuilding the villages following the 1991 earthquake, which left 3000&#13;
villages and fifteen cities devastated. While HF facilitated housing loans in all the damaged&#13;
villages, it also built about 700 houses as example of safe construction, and built over 50 schools&#13;
and 17 health centers in rural areas on behalf of national and international donating bodies.&#13;
75. Although the HF has gathered a lot of experience in implementing projects in accordance to&#13;
local procurement regulations, the overall project risk for procurement is judged to be high. To&#13;
ensure that the PMU/CMU staff receive adequate training on procurement according to Bank&#13;
Guidelines, it is proposed that: a) a procurement specialist from the Bank provide initial on-site&#13;
training to these staff during the project launch mission; b) a detailed time-scaled training plan for&#13;
all PMU/CMU staff dealing with procurement is developed and submitted to the Bank no later&#13;
than June 30, 2003; and, c) the provisions are made for the procurement specialists of the PMU&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
and CMU to attend external training, preferably at the ILO offices in Italy, with funding from the&#13;
Bank Loan.&#13;
PROCUREMENT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
76. Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with World Bank&#13;
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", published in January 1995&#13;
(revised January/August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999); and "Guidelines: Selections&#13;
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" published in January 1997 (revised&#13;
in September 1997, January 1999 and May 2002), and the provisions stipulated in the Loan&#13;
Agreement. A General Procurement Notice of bidding opportunities and consultant contracts will&#13;
be advertised in the UN Development Business before project launching and updated annually for&#13;
all outstanding procurement.&#13;
77. Where National Competitive Bidding (NCB) will be carried out, the procedure must be&#13;
acceptable to IBRD which would require:(a) explicit evaluation and award criteria in bid&#13;
documents; (b) national advertising with public bid opening; (c) sufficient time for bidders to&#13;
submit bids (four weeks usually);(d) no preference margin to domestic contractors or&#13;
manufacturers; (e) foreign bidders to participate in NCB if they so wish; and (f) contract award&#13;
to be made to the bidder whose offer is substantially responsive and lowest evaluated.&#13;
78. Iranian procurement procedures needs to be adapted to Bank requirement under the&#13;
procurement guidelines, irrespective of adequate capacity of implementing agencies to handle&#13;
procurement and adequate control organization in the country. The Bank's procedures need to be&#13;
applied in particular concerning the following issues:&#13;
* the use of two envelopes in bidding for works and goods: the envelopes containing the&#13;
administrative and technical documents, and the envelope containing the financial offer, will&#13;
be opened simultaneously in public and in one single stage, and prices are announced in the&#13;
same session; and&#13;
* services of consultants: open competitive bidding will not be used. In accordance with the&#13;
Bank's procedures, the Borrower addresses a request for proposals to a predetermined short&#13;
list. For consultants, the envelopes containing the financial proposals will be opened in public&#13;
in a second stage, only after the technical evaluation is completed.&#13;
Procurement of Works&#13;
79. Works to be procured under the project would include rec6nstructing housing units, schools&#13;
and health clinics scattered throughout the four provinces, rebuilding damaged social and public&#13;
infrastructure, such as water and drainage networks, telephone, power and electric systems, and&#13;
repairing agricultural infrastructure. In view of the emergency situation, and since it is not&#13;
anticipated that most contract would exceed US$5 million equivalent, and these works contracts&#13;
may be procured following NCB procedures, using standard bid documents agreed in advance&#13;
with the Bank. For housing in particular, notices for bids estimated not to exceed US$100,000&#13;
equivalent may be posted in the provincial government concerned and in neighboring provinces&#13;
as long as it has been established that there is a sufficient number of qualified contractors in the&#13;
communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
Procurement of Goods&#13;
80. Goods procured under the project would consist primarily of purchasing reconstruction&#13;
equipment for removal of debris and site preparation, as well as equipment for housing, the&#13;
purchase of construction materials, and mechanical equipment for schools, health clinics and&#13;
public infrastructure. To the extent possible, contracts for these goods will be grouped into&#13;
bidding packages of more than US$1 million and procured following ICB procedures, using Bank&#13;
SBDs. Contracts with estimated value below this threshold may be procured using NCB&#13;
procedures and Bank SBDs agreed with the Bank. Contracts for goods which cannot be grouped&#13;
into larger bidding packages and estimated to cost less than US$100,000 per contract may be&#13;
awarded on the basis of International Shopping (IS) or National Shopping (NS) in accordance to&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Selection of Consultants&#13;
81. Consulting services will be contracted to carry out technical studies, coordinate workshops,&#13;
and undertake seismic risk prevention and mitigation measures. These services would be&#13;
procured using a standard request for proposals document.&#13;
82. Firms: All contracts for firms would be procured using Quality and Cost Based Selection&#13;
(QCBS) except for contracts estimated to cost US$100,000 equivalent or less that would be&#13;
procured using selection based on Consultants' Qualifications (CQ).  Short lists may be&#13;
comprised entirely of national consultants (firms registered or incorporated in the country), if the&#13;
assignment does not exceed US$200, 000 equivalent, and a sufficient number of qualified firms&#13;
(at least three) are available at competitive costs and competition including foreign firms is not&#13;
justified. However, if foreign firms have expressed interest, they shall not be excluded from&#13;
consideration.&#13;
83. Individuals: Specialized advisory services would be provided by independent consultants&#13;
selected by comparison of qualifications of three candidates and hired in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of paragraphs 5.1 through 5.3 of the Consultant guidelines.&#13;
Prior Review Thresholds&#13;
84. Works contracts of US$500,000 or more, and goods contracts of US$250,000 or more are&#13;
subject to prior review by the Bank. In addition, the first two contracts for works and the first&#13;
two contracts for supply of goods, which are below these thresholds, are subject to prior review&#13;
by the Bank. For consultant assignments, all contracts including the terms of reference are&#13;
subject to the Bank's prior review.&#13;
Procurement Plan&#13;
85. At appraisal, the Borrower developed a procurement plan for the first year of project&#13;
implementation that provided the basis for the procurement methods. The Bank discussed this&#13;
plan with the Borrower and found it acceptable. It may, however, vary because of the emergency&#13;
nature of the project. For the first year, the total amount of contracts to be awarded is in the order&#13;
of US$65 million, as shown in Table 9. At the beginning of each calendar year, the Borrower will&#13;
update the procurement plan with a detailed procurement schedule for the coming year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
86. Frequency of procurement supervision. In addition to prior review to be carried out from&#13;
the Bank, it is recommended to have three full supervision missions during the first year of&#13;
implementation and to have two full supervision missions to visit each year the field thereafter&#13;
and carry out post review of procurement actions.&#13;

87. Financial Management Arrangements. The project is approved by the Higher Economic&#13;
Council and will be implemented in line with laws and regulations that govern execution and&#13;
control of public expenditure and are strictly enforced by the MOEAF and the Supreme Audit&#13;
Court of Iran. Financial management operations and functions are carried out at the center in&#13;
Teheran for all the four provinces. The PMU, that is located at the MOI in Teheran, complements&#13;
the existing financial management capacity of the MOI by being responsible for the financial&#13;
management arrangements of the project. The CMU, that will be located at the HF, will act as the&#13;
procurement advisor to the PMU. The PMU will conclude and sign/co-sign all contracts. The&#13;
financial management function, in Teheran, is divided between the Financial Controller (FC) of&#13;
the MOEAF who is assigned to and located at the MOI, and the PMU that is responsible for&#13;
project accounting and reporting. The FC is one of the two signatories on the Special Account&#13;
(SA), the PMU Director is the other. The FMS also carries out accounting and financial reporting&#13;
functions in order to provide the information required by the Bank in a regular, complete and&#13;
timely manner. The accounting records and the reports of the FC do not capture the project&#13;
accounting information in a complete and comprehensive manner as to allow the preparation of&#13;
the reports required by the Bank3.&#13;
88. Financial Reporting. The PMU is responsible for the preparation of quarterly FMR and the&#13;
annual PFS. The content of the FMR has already been discussed and are included in the&#13;
Operational Manual (OM). The FMR will be submitted to the Bank within 45 days from the end&#13;
of each calendar quarter.&#13;
89. Audit Arrangements. An independent audit firm acceptable to the Bank will be appointed to&#13;
audit the annual PFS. The audit should be carried out in line with the International Standards on&#13;
Auditing as published by the International Federation of Accountants, and the specific TOR&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. The audited PFS should be submitted to the Bank as soon as possible and&#13;
in any event not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. The TOR for the audit&#13;
assignment defines the scope of the audit. The MOI, HF, and all other government organizations&#13;
that are participating in implementation of the project should provide the auditor with access to&#13;
project-related documents and records, and any other information required for the purposes of the&#13;
project audit.&#13;
90. Financial Management Assessment. At project preparation, the financial management&#13;
arrangements of the project did not meet the Bank's minimum requirements. In order that these&#13;
arrangements meet the Bank's requirements and to further strengthen the financial management&#13;
arrangements: (i) a project FMS and a consultant will be appointed by no later than September&#13;
30, 2003. In order to further mitigate the risk in meeting the Bank's minimum requirements for&#13;
financial management of the project, complementary accounting and reporting procedures are&#13;
incorporated in the OM. The consultant: (a) will install a software for accounting and financial&#13;
reporting that is also capable of generating the reports required by the Bank, and will provide the&#13;
related training to the staff of the PMU, and (b) will assist with implementation of the OM at the&#13;
PMU, and will introduce procedures both for processing payment by the MOI/PMU on contracts&#13;
managed by the CMU as well as for supervision of equipment and material management&#13;
functions at the CMU, altogether, within two months from his (her) appointment and in no event&#13;
later than November 30, 2003. In the interim, the PMU uses computer spreadsheets to facilitate&#13;
accounting and preparation of the FMRs required by the Bank. The consultant will also provide&#13;
training in the use of these computer spreadsheets. In addition, in order to further strengthen and&#13;
build the financial management capacity of the PMU, the financial staff of the project will&#13;
3A set of Terms of References (Financial Management Specialist-FMS, Consultant for installing&#13;
accounting and financial reporting software, and audit) are integrated in the last part of Attachment 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
participate in a training program. A study tour in a bank-funded project in the region will also be&#13;
considered for the financial staff. During project supervision, regular reviews will be carried out&#13;
to ensure consistent application of the OM, at both the PMU and the CMU.&#13;
91. Disbursement. Withdrawals from the proceeds of the loan will be based on the traditional&#13;
disbursement methods of the Bank, using direct payments, payments against special&#13;
commitments and replenishments to the Special Account and reimbursement applications, either&#13;
fully documented or using Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) as per applicable procedures. As&#13;
projected by Bank's standard disbursement profiles, disbursements would be completed four&#13;
months after project closure. Disbursements would be made against standard Bank&#13;
documentation.&#13;
92. Special Account (SA). To facilitate disbursement of eligible expenditures for works, goods,&#13;
services and training, the Borrower will open and maintain a Special Account (SA) at a&#13;
Commercial Bank of Iran to cover eligible project expenditures to be managed and administered&#13;
by the PMU. Authorized allocation of the Special Account would be US$5 million covering an&#13;
estimated three months of eligible expenditures financed through the SA by the Loan. MOI/PMU&#13;
will be responsible for submitting monthly replenishment applications with appropriate&#13;
supporting documentation for expenditures incurred, including reconciled bank statements, for&#13;
expenditures incurred, and will retain and make the documents available for review by Bank&#13;
supervision missions and project auditors. All eligible project expenditures that are less than 20%&#13;
of the amount of the authorized allocation of the Special Account should be paid through the&#13;
Special Account.&#13;
93. Use of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). All applications to withdraw proceeds from the&#13;
Loan will be fully documented, except for: (a) expenditures of contracts for goods with an&#13;
estimated value of US$250,000 or less; (b) expenditures of contracts for works with an estimated&#13;
value of US$500,000 or less, (c) expenditures of training and contracts for consulting firms with&#13;
an estimated value of US$100,000 or less, and (d) US$50,000 or less for individual consultants,&#13;
which may be claimed on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Documentation&#13;
supporting expenditures claimed against SOEs will be retained by the Financial Controller at&#13;
MOI until at least one year after the Bank has received the audit report for the fiscal year in which&#13;
the last withdrawal from the Loan Account was made, and will be available for review when&#13;
requested by Bank supervision missions and project auditors. All disbursements will be subject to&#13;
the conditions of the grant Agreement and the procedures defined in the Disbursement Letter.&#13;

ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARD FRAMEWORK&#13;
ISLAMIC REPUBLU[C OF IAN&#13;
EARTHQUAKE EMERGENCY RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
Objectives&#13;
The environmental and social safeguards framework provides general policies, guidelines, codes&#13;
of practice and procedures to be integrated into the implementation of World Bank supported&#13;
Earthquake Emergency Recovery Project in Iran. Consistent with existing national legislation, the&#13;
objective of the framework is to help ensure that activities under the proposed operation will:&#13;
o  Protect human health&#13;
o  Prevent or compensate any loss of livelihood&#13;
o  Prevent environmental degradation as a result of either individual investments or their&#13;
cumulative effects;&#13;
o  Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes; and&#13;
o  Ensure compliance with World Bank safeguard policies.&#13;
General principles&#13;
Recognizing the emergency nature of the proposed operation, and the related need for proving&#13;
immediate assistance, while at the same time ensuring due diligence in managing potential&#13;
environmental and social risks, this framework is based on the following principles:&#13;
The proposed operation will support reconstruction of multiple investments (housing, utilities,&#13;
roads, schools, clinics, etc.), the detailed designs of which may not be known at appraisal. To&#13;
ensure the effective application of the World Bank's safeguard policies, the framework provides&#13;
guidance on the approach to be taken during implementation for the selection and design of&#13;
investments, and the planning of mitigation measures.&#13;
The proposed emergency operation will not support environmental Category A investments, nor&#13;
investments requiring land acquisition affecting 200 or more people. Consequently, no&#13;
environmental impact assessments (EIAs) or Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) will be required.&#13;
All proposed investments will be screened to ensure that the environmental and social risks can&#13;
be adequately addressed through the application of standard guidelines and codes of practice.&#13;
Responsibilities for safeguard screening and mitigation&#13;
Procurement and supervision of the civil works under the Component A and B will be managed&#13;
through Contract Management Unit to be set up in the Housing Foundation of the Islamic&#13;
Revolution (HF). The PMU and the Housing Foundation through its CMU will be responsible&#13;
for the safeguard screening and mitigation monitoring. Design of investments under Component&#13;
A and B follow the standards and norms defined in each sector and thus require close&#13;
coordination with the sector ministries and utilities represented at the provincial government&#13;
including the ministries of electricity and water, education, health, telecommunication, etc. Each&#13;
ministry and public utility will be responsible for applying the safeguard screening and mitigation&#13;
requirements to its own investments and will work closely with the CMU and the Department of&#13;
Environment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
The Environmental Protection Agency of Iran will have the ultimate responsibilities for clearance&#13;
of environmental measures and issuance of environmental construction permits. The mission&#13;
confirmed with them their readiness to assist with implementation of the framework. A unit has&#13;
been recently set up in the Department of Environment for overseeing the World Bank-financed&#13;
projects. This will serve as a one-stop shop for providing clearance to ensure compliance with&#13;
both the Government's procedure on environmental requirements and the Bank's safeguard and&#13;
environmental policies.&#13;
Capacity Building and Monitoring of Safeguard Framework Implementation&#13;
As part of the capacity building that will be provided for implementation of the proposed&#13;
operation the environmental specialist at the CMU as well as the safeguards focal points and&#13;
relevant staff of the concerned ministries at the provincial level will receive training in the&#13;
application of the safeguard framework.&#13;
To assist in this capacity building, and to provide subsequent guidance and review of the&#13;
application of the framework, the Project will contract specialist social and environmental&#13;
services. During supervision of these operations, the World Bank will assess the implementation&#13;
of the framework, and if required will recommend additional strengthening.&#13;
Consultation and Disclosure&#13;
This environmental and social safeguards framework was prepared in consultation with the&#13;
relevant departments and stakeholders such as the EPA of Iran, participating provincial&#13;
governments. The Government will disclose it in Iran and it will also be made available at the&#13;
World Bank's Infoshop prior to the approval by the Board of the World Bank.&#13;
Environmental Issues and Mitigations Measures&#13;
A set of environmental guidelines will be applied during project implementation. These&#13;
guidelines will serve as both a checklist to identify potential environmental issues and to ensure&#13;
public safety in areas related to: (a) demolition of damaged buildings and debris removal and&#13;
disposal; (b) control of erosion: (c) transportation of materials; (d) management of liquid and&#13;
solid waste, including hazardous materials from health clinics; and (e) public safety and&#13;
management of construction activities to minimize air and noise pollution.&#13;
The Environmental Guidelines are designed to provide guidance to the PMU and the CMU on the&#13;
procedures used to identify those investments that may induce negative environmental impacts.&#13;
Guidance is given on the mitigation of negative environmental impacts that may accrue from sub-&#13;
project construction. The guidelines are to be implemented during the application, screening,&#13;
assessment, approval and execution of investments.&#13;
Under the EERP, most of the eligible investments involve constructing, upgrading and&#13;
rehabilitating schools, health clinics as well as essential rural and urban roads, sidewalks,&#13;
retaining walls, street lighting and urgent repairs to potable water, storm water drains and&#13;
drainage systems. A very limited number of investments will involve constructing, rehabilitating,&#13;
upgrading and repairing new potable water sources, potable wells, water reservoirs and small&#13;
water supply systems. Sewage treatment plants, solid waste equipment, waste disposal sites are&#13;
not eligible for financing under the EERP. All investments will be subjected to environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
screening and assigned to one of two categories depending upon the magnitude and adversity of&#13;
predicted environmental impacts:&#13;
Category B       Projects that do have a significant effect on the environment. However, the negative&#13;
impacts are mainly short term and can be properly mitigated, and therefore require&#13;
only limited Environmental Assessment (EA).&#13;
Category C       Projects that do not have a significant impact upon the environment and therefore&#13;
do not require Environmental Assessment.&#13;
No EERP investments are expected to fall into Category A       classification. Most eligible&#13;
investments are expected to fall within Category C and will require no EA. Furthermore, since&#13;
these sub-projects will be small in scale, they will not be subject to environmental review. A&#13;
small number of investments that include new water supply, wastewater sewerage and municipal&#13;
roads may fall within Category B and may require a separate EA. However, the positive impacts,&#13;
such as the improvements in public health that will result from adequate water supplies are&#13;
expected to substantially outweigh any minor negative impacts. In most cases, any necessary&#13;
impact mitigation will be inherent in standard engineering design and good construction practice.&#13;
Investments considered to impose unacceptable negative environmental impact will not be&#13;
approved for financing.&#13;
GOOD PRACTICE ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION PROCEDURES&#13;
The mitigation of potential environmental impacts may be achieved in a variety of ways. This&#13;
involves implementing good engineering design and construction techniques and ensuring that&#13;
the Contractor undertakes his work in accordance with good construction practices. This is best&#13;
dealt with by incorporating mitigation clauses into the Bidding Documents, thereby allowing the&#13;
Contractor to make any necessary financial provisions from the outset. Site supervision staff&#13;
must check that the works are carried out in accordance with such clauses throughout project&#13;
implementation. However, as mentioned earlier, the majority of the sub-projects to be funded&#13;
under the EERP will have minor or no environmental impact. These will be identified at an early&#13;
stage in the project cycle and adequately mitigated, so that positive impacts substantially&#13;
outweigh negative ones, and only those few impacts that cannot be reasonably mitigated, are&#13;
accepted. General descriptions of mitigation measures for negative environmental impacts under&#13;
the EERP are given below:&#13;
Good Practice Mitigation Measures for Negative Impacts&#13;
IMPACT                                 GOOD PRACTICE MITIGATION&#13;
1.  Obstruction of Road  During construction, the total closure of roads should be avoided and single line traffic&#13;
Access              maintained wherever possible. T'raffic flow should be managed and working areas cordoned off&#13;
for the safety of both the public and construction workers. Such areas should also be adequately&#13;
lighted throughout the hours of darkness.&#13;
2. Disruption of Public  During construction, and where existing services such as water, sewerage, electricity and&#13;
Services            telephones have to be temporarily disconnected, the period of disconnection should be kept to a&#13;
minimum. Where disruption for an extended period is unavoidable, alternative arrangements&#13;
should be made.&#13;
3. Generation of        The generation of construction traffic should be minimized wherever possible Heavy transport&#13;
Construction Traffic  and equipment activity should be restricted to normal working hours&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
4.  Water Supply and       The development of new water sources must be linked to the availability of resources without&#13;
Water PoUution         derogation of existing supplies For new boreholes, a survey of adjacent wells must be&#13;
undertaken and data on ground water levels, pumping rates and water quality collected All new&#13;
boreholes will be subjected to test pumping on completion, at a discharge rate greater than that&#13;
at which they will be expected to operate&#13;
Wastewater sub-projects require particular attention to the disposal of raw sewage flows Where&#13;
this is to a regional trunk collector, the capacity of the pipeline to take the increased flows must&#13;
be established Where sewage is ultimately discharged to a treatment works, its capacity must&#13;
be adequate to take the additional flows&#13;
5.  Soil Erosion           Where construction is undertaken during the rainy season, open trenches should be lined or&#13;
covered with plastic sheeting and their sides adequately supported  Construction should be&#13;
prograrnmed so major excavations and movements of spoil are undertaken during the summer&#13;
months Avoid stockpiling soil on hillsides, and cover spoil tips during periods of rain&#13;
6.  Disniption of Road     The disruption of natural drainage should be kept to a minimum  The excavation of cut-off&#13;
Drainage               trenches and diversion channels may need to be constructed as Temporary Works until land re-&#13;
grading, concrete culverts or permanent diversion channels can be completed&#13;
7.  Disposal of Spoil      Demolition and excavated materials must be deposited only at locations previously agreed for&#13;
the purpose with the Municipality Wherever possible, spoil should be reused for backfill and&#13;
reinstatement, or taken to a site approved for such disposal. Small quantities may be graded&#13;
over adjacent land where this does not result in the deterioration of soil fertility&#13;

11. Rehabilitaton of       Sub-projects shall give priority to the rehabilitation of toilets in schools and clinics and to the&#13;
schools and clinics    proper disposal of hazardous and infectious wastes&#13;
Environmental Monitoring&#13;
Environmental monitoring for most sub-projects will be limited to compliance monitoring during&#13;
construction. This will comprise on-site inspection of construction activities to ensure that the&#13;
environmental mitigation measures included in the Scope of Work of the Contractor are being&#13;
implemented. Compliance monitoring will be undertaken by the supervising engineer and, when&#13;
required, by an environmental specialist who could be called upon on a part-time basis to inspect&#13;
certain environmental mitigation measures on-site. The environmental monitoring indicators to&#13;
be used for the EERP include:&#13;

CAPACITY BUILDING FOR DISASTER MANAGEMENT&#13;
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN&#13;
EARTHQUAKE EMERGENCY RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
The Islamic Republic of Iran is a large and complex country at serious risk from natural disasters.&#13;
To date earthquakes have been the most significant risk.4 These occur annually, have taken a&#13;
disproportionate share of lives, left thousands homeless, and caused heavy and physical,&#13;
economic and social damage. The last significant manifestation was the earthquake in Qazvin&#13;
and surrounding provinces in June of this year measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale5. This&#13;
earthquake killed some 230 persons, destroyed 1600 houses, left 25,000 persons homeless, and&#13;
resulted in damage, including damage to social and physical infrastructure, livestock etc.,&#13;
estimated by GOI at more than US$140m (replacement costs).&#13;
But Iran has seen even greater camage. The earthquake which hit Rasht/Gilan Provinces in June&#13;
of 1990 measured 7.7 on the Richter scale, killed some 50,000 persons, destroyed some 120, 000&#13;
houses, left 60,000 homeless and resulted in damage estimated by the World Bank at US$5.25b,&#13;
or 2.5% of GDP. An official report by the Iranian Housing Foundation, a local NGO affiliated to&#13;
the Ministry of Housing, indicated that during the 1993-2001 period some 600,000 dwellings, or&#13;
about 5 percent of the total country housing stock, was severely damaged or destroyed by natural&#13;
disasters. The Foundation also estimated that overall property damage was more than US$10&#13;
billion, and that in the 1999-2001 period government subsidies to homeowners affected by natural&#13;
disasters exceeded US$1 billion, or about 1.3 percent of GDP.&#13;
By way of comparison with other countries, the Rasht/Gilan earthquake in 1990 was even more&#13;
severe than the earthquakes which wreaked havoc in Turkey (Marmara) in 1999 and Japan&#13;
(Kobe) 1995 and created proportionally more damage to life and property. Also, in Rasht/Gilan&#13;
Iran experienced even greater loss of life and property than that experienced during the Mexico&#13;
City Earthquake of 1985, even though the latter was far more intense.6  Obviously then,&#13;
earthquakes present GOI with a very serious economic and. social challenge. They occur&#13;
regularly, and with devastating effect every five to ten years. And if a highly populated area such&#13;
as Tehran city was to experience a severe tremor such as those discussed above, the loss of life&#13;
other damages could be catastrophic.'&#13;
4 Flooding is reportedly on the increase and becoming a serious risk.&#13;
5 There have been several quakes since&#13;
6 Data for Iran are from recent World Bank mission reports, particularly the AIDE MEMOIRE, Iran&#13;
Housing Reform Loan: Natural Disasters Insurance Component, July 5, 2002, by Eugene Gurenko et al.&#13;
Data for Turkey, Japan and Mexico are from Turkey, Marmara Earthquake Assessment, September 14,&#13;
1999, Turkey Country Office, World Bank, ppl2 &amp; 13.&#13;
7Tehran has been spared from serious earthquake damage to date. It is not invulnerable, however. A&#13;
recent estimate by the Financial Times indicated that an earthquake of 8 in Tehran would leave over I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
The core of the problem appears to be: a) a relatively high proportion of structurally unsound&#13;
building sited on geologically unstable lands; and b) inadequate national disaster planning and&#13;
management systems. The former often intersects with poverty, insufficient public information&#13;
concerning proper construction and land use techniques, and insufficient attention to enforcement&#13;
of building regulations. The latter is more complex and requires more detailed analysis. Clearly,&#13;
though, the institutional arrangements for disaster prevention and mitigation need strengthening.&#13;
The magnitude of the challenge requires that the GOI improves the effectiveness of institutions&#13;
and systems to prevent and/or minimize earthquake disasters. This will build on the past&#13;
preparedness and planning work carried-out by the GOI during the last ten years. The GOI is&#13;
fully aware of the challenge and, with the assistance of the World Bank, wishes to develop "best&#13;
practices" in this field. Accordingly GOI intends to strengthen its disaster preparedness and&#13;
management systems (DPMS). It intends to proceed by:&#13;
o Obtaining a better grasp of the nature, location, frequency and scope of the earthquake&#13;
problem in Iran;&#13;
o Obtaining a better understanding of the intersection of poverty; poor code&#13;
understanding, application and enforcement, earthquake risk, and damages to life, limb&#13;
and property;&#13;
o Assessing the ability of current Iranian systems and institutions to predict likely&#13;
occurrence and estimate damage potential;&#13;
o Assessing the capacity and performance of existing DPMS and structures to revent&#13;
serious damage, and to mitigate and respond quickly and appropriately when disasters&#13;
do occur. (This includes an assessment of responses to the 1999 Rasht/Gilan and&#13;
subsequent earthquakes, and more recent 2002 Qazvin earthquake);&#13;
o Comparing recent Iranian, Turkish, and Japanese experience and performance with&#13;
best practice and each other; and&#13;
o Reviewing best practice in the DPM field.&#13;
On the basis of the above, GOI intends to establish effective DPMS and institutions in Iran,&#13;
having regard to Iranian institutions and the priorities of GOI. Such a design will adapt best&#13;
practices worldwide to the particular situation of Iran.&#13;
The overall task will be undertaken by GOI experts over the next [2-3] years, with the&#13;
assistance of local and international consultants. These consultants will be employed on terms&#13;
and conditions acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
The tasks to be executed under these TOR are the first of three stage of a broader DPMS&#13;
reform process which is structure as follows:&#13;
Stage 1: System Stocktaking and Options Review;&#13;
Stage 2: Detailed System Development and Testing;&#13;
Stage 3. Full (Nationwide) System Implementation and Documentation.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
The specific objective of these TOR is to provide guidance to consultants who will be employed&#13;
by GOI (the client) to help develop proposals for DPMS reform. In particular, the consultants&#13;
shall:&#13;
a) Assess and report on Iran 's current state and level of disaster preparedness, with special&#13;
focus on earthquake disaster preparedness and management (stocktaking);&#13;
b) Develop guidelines for effective reforms aimed at achieving "best practice" in Iran and&#13;
thereby minimizing the negative impacts offuture earthquakes.&#13;
PROCESS&#13;
In undertaking their tasks, the consultants shall consult extensively and liaise closely with GOI&#13;
and local experts. To facilitate this, the MOI will assemble a counterpart team (CT) of these&#13;
experts for this purpose. This team will be led by a Task Manager appointed by GOI. The CT&#13;
is expected to participate actively and to assist the consultants wherever possible in the&#13;
execution of task, and will be held accountable for doing so. They are not expected to be&#13;
passive by-standers, but a vital part in developing and carrying forward the reform process.&#13;
Nevertheless, the consultants will be held solely responsible for the quality and timely&#13;
delivery of the work.&#13;
Workshops of experts and key stakeholders should be convened periodically, where useful and&#13;
deemed necessary by the TM and the consultants. The assessments to be undertaken, the&#13;
workshops to be held, and the reports to be produced by the consultants shall provide&#13;
technical, institutional, legal, financial and operational guidance to GOI. They should also&#13;
help to build a broad consensus on subsequent phases of the efforts to be later undertaken by&#13;
GOI (see discussion above), including any necessary reforms and reform processes.&#13;

RAPID INSTITUTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF THE HOUSING FoUNDATION'&#13;
ISLArMC REPUBLIC OF IRAN&#13;
EARTHQUAKE EMERGENCY RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
Summary&#13;
The Housing Foundation (HF) was established in April 1979 as a non-governmental organization&#13;
with the mandate to provide housing for the poor. Its original source of funding came from a&#13;
special revolutionary account (Account 100) created through public donations. The HF became a&#13;
specialized para-statal agency witlh a clear mandate and bylaws. HF's bylaws were approved by&#13;
the national parliament on December 7, 1987 giving it the following responsibilities:&#13;
o  Studying the housing needs of the poor in rural and urban areas and preparing the means&#13;
to provide low-income families with inexpensive housing through their participation&#13;
o  Preparing plans for settlement complexes and inexpensive housing units and realizing&#13;
them directly or with the help of the people in coordination with relevant government&#13;
organs in rural and urban areas&#13;
o  Preparing land for the implementation of the plans and projects&#13;
o  Assisting in the provision of construction materials through procurement, production and&#13;
distribution&#13;
o  Supervising zero-interest loans for rural housing and low interest loans for urban housing&#13;
to be awarded through financial resources provided by the national banking system&#13;
o  Preparing guiding plans and street improvement plans for villages in coordination with&#13;
relevant government organs and implementing them -- utilizing government allocated&#13;
resources -- with people's participation&#13;
o  Preparing and implementing housing renovation and reconstruction projects in disaster-&#13;
stricken villages with the help of the people in coordination with relevant government&#13;
organs&#13;
The HF is the sole national organization responsible for rural housing and. streets and surface&#13;
water drainage. Additionally, HF is involved in a number of related activities from construction&#13;
of rural access roads to the provision of utilities to producing construction materials. It has&#13;
offices in all provinces and about 120 centers across the country to implement its projects.&#13;
One of HF's important mandates is to address the needs of disaster-stricken areas. HF began&#13;
reconstruction activities in war damaged areas in 1982 at the same time that the Iran-Iraq War&#13;
was still escalating. Further, HF has been active in all natural disaster-stricken areas since its&#13;
inception. These include areas hit by floods, earthquakes, or any other form of natural disasters.&#13;
HF has been active in the reconstruction of damaged areas following the two recent earthquakes&#13;
in Kermanshah and Qazvin/Zanjan/Hamadan. Its record to date in these two areas is provided in&#13;
another report. A detailed report on the institutional review of the Housing Foundation is included&#13;
in the project files.&#13;

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN&#13;
EARTHQUAKE EMERGENCY RECOVERY PROJECT&#13;
A.     Financial Management&#13;
1.     Summary of Financial Management Assessment. Based on a review of the financial&#13;
management arrangements at the PMU, the financial management system in place does not&#13;
currently meet the minimum requirements of the Bank for accounting and financial reporting. In&#13;
order to meet those requirements there is a need for (i) appointment of an FMS to manage the&#13;
financial operations and reporting at the PMU, (ii) Implementation of the comprehensive OM for&#13;
the financial management operations that has already been prepared', and (iii) appointment of a&#13;
consultant to install a software for accounting and financial reporting, and to implement the OM.&#13;
Appointment of the FMS and the consultant will take place no later than September 30, 2003.&#13;
Appointment of an FMS allows production of the quarterly FMR and the annual PFS in a regular,&#13;
complete and timely manner. Implementation of the procedures contained in the OM by the&#13;
consultant will provide an adequate level of segregation of duties and a clear division of&#13;
responsibilities. TORs for the appointment of both the FMS and the consultant are already&#13;
submitted to the MOI.&#13;
2.     The financial management issues that merit particular attention in the project&#13;
implementation are the following: (a) reinforcement of the procedures for the financial&#13;
management functions at the PMU, and supervision of equipment and material management&#13;
functions and operations at the CMU, (b) institution of an effective financial management&#13;
information system which is also capable of generating FMRs to be submitted to the Bank; and&#13;
(c) introduction of suitable procedures for processing payment by the MOI/PMIU on contracts&#13;
managed by the CMU. It is expected that the implementing agency will need a period of at least&#13;
five months to implement items (a) to (c) listed above, all of which form part of the scope of work&#13;
of the consultant. In the interim, the PMU uses computer spreadsheets to facilitate accounting and&#13;
preparation of the reports required by the Bank. The consultant will also provide training in the&#13;
use of those computer spreadsheets.&#13;
3.     Risk analysis. The tables below present a risk analysis of the financial management&#13;
arrangements for the operations at the center, in Teheran. An OM has been prepared for use by&#13;
project staff for the financial management aspects of the project, amongst others. The financial&#13;
management staff of the project will participate in a training program. In addition, a study tour in&#13;
a Bank-funded project in the region will also be considered.&#13;

Overall Risk Rating                                M&#13;
For both operations in Teheran and in the provinces&#13;
(i) The absence of a country analytical work such as the CFAA; (ii) the decentralized financial execution of the project and coordination of the&#13;
contracting activities involving a large volume of contracts through a separate entity, i.e., the HF/CMU, (iii) lack of a review of the capability of&#13;
the audit firms, (iv) newness of the staff and the lack of familiarity with the Bank procedures, and (v) the very nature of the project, (an&#13;
emergency project) are the factors for the final rating of "High" risk for the financial management of the project. However, (i) the experience of&#13;
the FCs which has demonstrated the strict enforcement of budget regulations, (ii) the cross support and the training that will be provided, (iii)&#13;
the accounting and reporting set up at the center and in the govenorates that are in line with the rules and regulations on public finance, and (iv)&#13;
the existence of a comprehensive OM and reinforcement measures that will be introduced by the consultant constitute the main risk mitigation&#13;
measures&#13;
Risk Ranking H (High Risk), S (Substantial Risk), M (Modest Risk), and N (Negligible or Low Risk)&#13;
4.       Financial Management Arrangements The project is approved                 by the Economic&#13;
Council. The project is implemented in line with the laws and regulations that govern all aspects&#13;
of public expenditure and are strictly enforced. All the financial management operations and&#13;
functions are carried out at the center in Teheran for all the four provinces. In Teheran, the PMU&#13;
has the overall responsibility for all the financial management matters relating to the project.&#13;
5.       Staffing, Accounting, and Flow of Information. The financial management function is&#13;
divided between the PMU, which is responsible for accounting and reporting of the project&#13;
activities, and the FC of the MOEAF who is assigned to and located at the MOI. The FC is&#13;
responsible for budget execution and financial management of the MOI and its related&#13;
organizations. The PMU and the office of the FC coordinate between themselves all the flows of&#13;
information for financial management purposes. The FC is a signatory on all the bank accounts&#13;
that the FC him (her) self is responsible for opening in the name of the MOI, including the&#13;
foreign currency Special Account, and the project local currency account. The FC is also&#13;
responsible for commitment for expenditure, the approval of the payment and the actual payment,&#13;
and the financial reporting in line with the requirements that govern public expenditure in Iran.&#13;
The FC performs all its functions in line with the regulations governing the management of public&#13;
ex'penditure that are strictly enforced by the MOEAF and supervised by the Supreme Audit Court&#13;
of Iran.&#13;
6.      The FMS in the PMU is responsible for the overall financial management of the project,&#13;
annual budgeting and the project general accounting, and the preparation of FMRs for submission&#13;
to the Bank. These responsibilities require the FMS to perform functions that include budget&#13;
preparation, initiation of expenditure, effecting the expenditure, receipt of goods and services,&#13;
preparation of forms relating to accounting transactions, follow-up on the request for payments,&#13;
record keeping, verification of supporting documents, preparing bank reconciliation statements,&#13;
preparing periodic reports and financial statements, and coordination in financial reporting as&#13;
well as monitoring of the Special Accounts (SA) with the FC. The PMU Director also serves as&#13;
one of the two signatories on the SA, the FC is the other. The FMS will also work directly with&#13;
the CMU for payments to the contractors. The CMU, that will be located at the HF, will be&#13;
responsible for management of all contracts. CMU will act as an advisor to the PMU for contracts&#13;
negotiations and management of their execution. PMU will conclude and sign all contracts. CMU&#13;
will manage contract executions, reporting, and approving the request for payments submitted by&#13;
the contractors. CMU will submit to the PMU the reports on contracts executions as well as the&#13;
requests for payments to the contractors. PMU makes payments directly to the contractors. The&#13;
number of payments to most of the contractors is not expected to be substantial as the major&#13;
contracts represent purchase of large civil works projects and construction equipment, and as such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
mostly require few large payments. A regular (at least on a monthly basis) reconciliation between&#13;
the accounting records of the FC relating to the execution of the Development Budget at the MOI,&#13;
and the project records kept by the FMS will be carried out by the FMS. A similar monthly&#13;
reconciliation between the records of the CMU and those of the PMU on the status of all&#13;
contracts will be prepared by the FMS. The assignment of responsibilities is shown in Tables&#13;
l,and 2 below. The responsibilities and functions including the preparation of reconciliation&#13;
statements just described are covered further in detail in the OM.&#13;

Iran and also meet the Bank's requirements for accounting and financial reporting&#13;
in writing, and install that in the Software,&#13;
* Run dummy transactions and prepare dummy reports in line with the requirements&#13;
of the Bank for financial reporting (FMRS and the PFS), and those of the&#13;
MOIVPMU,&#13;
* Train the FMS and a back-up staff in the use of the software,&#13;
* Implement accounting and financial procedures for the project that are contained in&#13;
the OM with due regard to the issues that will be raised by the officials of the&#13;
MOI/PMU to ensure compliance with the rules and regulations that govern the&#13;
management of public expenditure in Iran as well as the terms and conditions of&#13;
the loan agreement, and clearly document the changes and additions in writing and&#13;
integrate them in the existing OM as and where appropriate, and&#13;
* Explain different aspects contained in the revised OM to the MOI/PMU for&#13;
implementation purposes. In particular, advise the PMU in setting up the detailed&#13;
procedures and processes that meet the Bank's requirements for accounting,&#13;
internal controls and financial reporting,&#13;
* Carry out a similar exercise as it relates to the implementation of the OM, as&#13;
above, at the HF/CMU for contract management and execution and in particular&#13;
introduce procedures (i) at the HF/CMU for reporting to the MOI/PMU on contract&#13;
executions, (ii) for processing payment at the MOI/PMU to the contractors, and&#13;
(iii) for supervision of equipment and material management functions at the&#13;
HF/CMU,&#13;
* In the interim period, advice on the use of computer spreadsheets that are included&#13;
in the OM and its annexes, both at the PMU and the CMU.&#13;
4.TTHE ADVISE BY THE CONSULTANT SHOULD EXTEND TO:&#13;
a. Internal Controls&#13;
Defining (in writing) clearly administrative, accounting and operational processes (based on the&#13;
procedures contained in the OM) that define levels of authority and responsibilities, ensure an&#13;
orderly and efficient payment and procurement process, and properly record and safeguard&#13;
project-related assets and resources. Specific attention should be given to establishing:&#13;
* A process to identify and track sources of project financing, including the flow of&#13;
funds and the timing of such flows (whether direct to the project or through&#13;
government entities);&#13;
* A suitable authorization process for award of contracts and purchase of equipment&#13;
and supplies, including documentation procedures;&#13;
* An appropriate segregation of duties and responsibilities, including invoice&#13;
processing, accounting duties, and payment functions;&#13;
* Design and help implement the use of standard forms for recording and controlling&#13;
all transactions;&#13;
* Arrangements for storing project documents and restricting access to authorized&#13;
personnel only.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58&#13;
b. Accounting System&#13;
The accounting system developed for the PMU should reflect project needs and be designed to&#13;
provide financial information to all interested parties, including the PMU, the Bank, and&#13;
oversight agencies. The computerized system, at a minimum, should:&#13;
o Provide information which is compatible with agreed accounting standards;&#13;
o Permit the establishment of a Chart of Accounts which has a logical structure for&#13;
recording accounting transactions, is based on the project's budget, and has the&#13;
capacity to classify and sub-classify accounting data;&#13;
o Facilitate the development of a budgeting system, including planned allocation of&#13;
resources, which would be coordinated with the financial accounts in order to&#13;
reconcile budget variances with financial figures;&#13;
o Summarize accounting balances by source (World Bank or counterpart), category&#13;
(works, goods or services), and project component;&#13;
o Record individual transactions by vendor;&#13;
o Allow for transfers and adjustments between accounts;&#13;
o Assist the user to process and maintain Statements of Expenditure (SOEs); and&#13;
o Provide financial data to measure project performance and create audit trails.&#13;
c. Accounting Standards&#13;
In line with the national accounting standards, supplemented, where justifiable, by the&#13;
International Accounting Standards (IAS). The use of IAS standards helps to ensure consistent&#13;
recording of financial data and presentation of financial statements, and greatly facilitates&#13;
interpretation of the information presented.&#13;
d Records Management&#13;
The management of records should provide-a paper trail on which the accounting system is based,&#13;
and verification of financial transactions. For each financial transaction, an individual record&#13;
should be created. Records management should include:&#13;
o Clearly defined procedures for creating and maintaining records;&#13;
o Adequate backup procedures;&#13;
o The storage of physical financial records under lock and key and safe from&#13;
environmental risks (fire and water damage); and&#13;
o Easy access for authorized personnel only.&#13;
e.     Financial Reporting&#13;
THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF&#13;
PRODUCING A FULL ARRAY OF MFIANCLAL STATEMENTS AND REPORTS,&#13;
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO:&#13;
o The annual PFS, including the balance sheet, sources and uses of funds, cash flow&#13;
statements, and notes to the financial statements; and other reports as contained in&#13;
the OM,&#13;
o The quarterly FMR as defined in the Guide for Borrowers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

A model of unqualified audit opinion for a Project's financial statements is attached as&#13;
Annex 2 to the current TOR.&#13;
ii)    Management Letter:&#13;
The Auditors should report by way of a management letter any significant accounting and&#13;
control issues arising from the audit, as identified during the internal control mechanisms&#13;
review together with the related risk. The letter, with management responses, and&#13;
recommendation to address the situation and insufficiencies, should be made available to&#13;
the Project's governing body in time. As annex of the management letter the auditor will&#13;
mention whether or not recommendations issued on the previous management letter have&#13;
been considered by the PIU and/or governing body.&#13;
6.     Audit Process:&#13;
Audit will be conducted in two phases:&#13;
Interim Phase: to be undertaken during the last four months of the current fiscal year which will&#13;
be dedicated to the review of the internal control system for the project, compliance with the&#13;
Bank's procurement guidelines, and conduct preliminary audit and risk assessment.&#13;
Final Phase: to be during the four months following the end of the fiscal year to be dedicated to&#13;
the update of the interim review and complete financial audit.&#13;
7.     General Principles for the Audit:&#13;
The auditor should be registered as certified public accountants with the appropriate&#13;
professional body in the country and have substantial experience in auditing major projects in&#13;
the country. In case of government auditing, the audit team should be adequately staffed with&#13;
qualified auditors having substantial experience in auditing major projects. The same audit&#13;
principles should be applied if the audit is conducted by private or government auditors. The&#13;
general principles under which the audit will be conducted are according to [AS or GAAS&#13;
and are summarized in Annex 1.&#13;
8.    Irregularities Including Fraud&#13;
The Governing Body is responsible for ensuring the establishment and maintenance of an&#13;
adequate system of internal control. It is also responsible for ensuring compliance with&#13;
statutory and other regulations, and for the prevention and detection of irregularities,&#13;
including fraud. Although, the Auditors are not required to search specifically for such&#13;
matters, the Audit shall be planned and conducted so that the Auditors have a reasonable&#13;
expectation of detecting material misstatements in the accounts resulting from irregularities,&#13;
including fraud, or breach of regulations.&#13;
The Auditors will report in writing any serious weaknesses, fraud, irregularities or accounting&#13;
break-downs that they come across in the normal course of their duties to the designated&#13;
office holder, Governing Body, and the World Bank without delay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64&#13;
9.     Access to Information and Documents&#13;
The Auditors shall have rights of access to the books, accounts, vouchers, Loan Agreement,&#13;
Project Agreement and related Supplemental Letters, Project Appraisal Document,&#13;
correspondence, and all other documents in relation of the Project and to such information&#13;
and explanations as auditors consider necessary to perform their duties and fulfill their&#13;
responsibilities. In addition, the auditors will be provided with copies of the World Bank&#13;
publications that the governing body has to recognize including: (i) World Bank guidelines&#13;
"Financial Accounting, Reporting, and Auditing Handbook" (FARAH) (ii) the World Bank&#13;
"Project Financial Management " issued in February 1998 (iii) the World Bank "Procurement&#13;
Guidelines"&#13;
In turn, on occasions where the World Bank representative may wish to meet with Projects'&#13;
auditors, particularly in connection with a visit to the auditors office and review the audit&#13;
working papers files and discuss the work performed and conclusion reached by the auditors.&#13;
The Auditor should not limit access in any way and must reply to all inquiries raised by the&#13;
World Bank representative. Failure to comply with this provision may disqualify the auditors&#13;
from dealing with the all projects funded or administered by the World Bank. Formal&#13;
discussion should normally be arranged through the Project's designated office holder or&#13;
representative. The World Bank will have this exclusive right during performance of the audit&#13;
and within 2 years after completion of the audit engagement.&#13;
10.    Annual Meetings&#13;
The Auditor will be requested to attend the meeting of the Governing Body to which the&#13;
Project's annual reports and financial statements of account are presented. The Auditor will&#13;
receive all notices and other communications relating to that meeting which any member of&#13;
the Governing Body is entitled to receive. The Auditor will discuss the audit report and&#13;
management report and any part of the business, which concerns the auditor.&#13;
11.    Termination of Appointment&#13;
If there are serious shortcomings on the part of the Auditor, the Governing Body, after&#13;
consultation with the World Bank, may pass a resolution to remove the Auditors before the&#13;
expiry of their assignment.&#13;
12)    Restriction of Auditor's Liability&#13;
There is no limitation of the auditors' liability in respect of audit opinions given under this&#13;
assignment. The Project's Governing Body will not agree to any such restriction in liability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
General Principles for Auditors&#13;
Duties&#13;
The audit of Project's funds constitutes audit procedures additional to those required&#13;
under International Auditing Standards on Auditing, since auditors are also concerned&#13;
with the World Bank's requirements and, if applicable, those of other donors.&#13;
Independence&#13;
Auditors should avoid the following:&#13;
a. Official, professional and personal relationships which might cause the auditor to limit&#13;
the extent or character of the audit.&#13;
b. Any involvement in the executive management of the Project.&#13;
c. Any interest, financial or non-financial, direct or indirect, in the Project.&#13;
Due professional care&#13;
In exercising due professional care auditors should:&#13;
a. Take reasonable steps to obtain information relevant to the audit. Auditors should take&#13;
into account information from the Project and the related ministry, any changes in&#13;
legislation, and the results of previous audit work.&#13;
b. Keep up to date with developments in professional matters.&#13;
c. Look out for and take into account any unusual circumstances.&#13;
d. Consider audit objectives and plan work to adhere to them.&#13;
e. Document the conclusions arising from the planning process, and detail a budget for&#13;
staff and time.&#13;
f. Discuss the main features of the audit with the Project management and the World&#13;
Bank representative.&#13;
g. Ensure that audits are staffed with suitably qualified and experienced personnel, and&#13;
that work is properly controlled and reviewed. Also co-ordinate the work of specialist&#13;
staff.&#13;
h. Obtain and document sufficient and complete audit evidence, so that an experienced&#13;
auditor with no previous connection with the audit can ascertain what work was done and&#13;
what conclusions were reached.&#13;
i. Ensure that conclusions are adequately supported by reliable evidence.&#13;
j. Maintain objectivity at all times.&#13;
k. Preserve confidentiality where appropriate.&#13;
&#13;

Address&#13;
We have audited the balance sheet of ABC Project as of December 31, 2000 and the&#13;
Statement of funds receipts and expenditures for the year then ended.&#13;
Respective responsibilities of the governing body and auditors&#13;
The governing body is responsible for ensuring that financial statements are prepared. It&#13;
is our responsibility to form an independent opinion, based on our audit, on those&#13;
statements and to report our opinion to you.&#13;
Basis of opinion&#13;
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and such&#13;
other specific procedures requested by the Governing Body.  An audit includes&#13;
examination, on a test basis, evidence supporting amounts and disclosures in the financial&#13;
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments&#13;
made by the governing body in the preparation of the financial statements, and of&#13;
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Project's (group's) circumstances,&#13;
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.&#13;
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations&#13;
which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give&#13;
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,&#13;
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also&#13;
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial&#13;
statements.&#13;
Opinion&#13;
In our opinion:&#13;
The financial statements referred to above give a true and fair view of the balance sheet&#13;
of the Project and the balance of the reconciled Special Account as of December 31,&#13;
200X (each fiscal year) and the statement of funds receipts and expenditures for the year&#13;
then ended. Also, expenditures provided in statement of expenditures are properly&#13;
supported and represent eligible expenditures under the Loan Agreement. Also,&#13;
procurements of goods and services incurred during the year were conducted in&#13;
accordance with the World Bank Procurement Guidelines issued in October 1995.&#13;

procurement of works, goods and services. The CMU will also participate and provide logistical&#13;
support to the evaluation processes (Requests for Proposals, Terms of Reference, and&#13;
participation in the evaluation of offers with recommendations for contract award, and follow up&#13;
on contract signing and legal documentation). The CMU will secure the prior approval of the&#13;
MPO for the financing of sectoral sub-projects. It will provide also contract management support&#13;
to sector ministries and will assist them in the selection of contractors and consultants for works,&#13;
technical assistance and studies. The CMU will supervise contracts under execution, carryout&#13;
project monitoring and certify payments to contractors.&#13;
The Project Manager will be fully responsible for the sound implementation of the project&#13;
according to the "Implementation Agreement" with the Ministry of Interior. An environmental&#13;
specialist will be recruited on demand basis and will assist the Supervising Officers in monitoring&#13;
the environmental compliance of subprojects on a bi-annual basis. The full job description of&#13;
professional CMU staff is included in the attached table.&#13;
The CMU will assume the reporting responsibilities and prepare quarterly and annual progress&#13;
reports in addition to the completion report. The specific activities that will be carried-out by the&#13;
CMU are described below:&#13;
(a)- Project Preparation and Procurement&#13;
* Ensuring the timely implementation of Component-A and Component-B of the EERP and&#13;
constantly updating the PMU at the MOI on progress.&#13;
* Advising sector ministries and government agencies, on the preparation of the request for&#13;
proposals and tender documents for the procurement of services, goods and works under the EERP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

o Advising on procurement evaluation committees for sector subprojects at the different ministries.&#13;
O Developing and updating monitoring and evaluation indicators for the different types of&#13;
subprojects&#13;
o Ensuring coordination with government agencies and securing the prior approval of the MPO for&#13;
the financing of sub-projects.&#13;
o Screening subprojects to identify those classified EA Category B for further review and ensure&#13;
compliance with the EA Guidelines and that appropriate mitigation measures are incorporated in&#13;
subproject designs and are being implemented.&#13;
o Maintaining accurate procurement records, including all actions and documents. This includes&#13;
advertisement, preparation of bids, invitation to bid, record of bid submissions, bid opening,&#13;
evaluation of bids, contract award and performance of the contracts. The Procurement files will be&#13;
maintained for review by the World Bank supervision missions.&#13;

            Iran - Earthquake Emergency Recovery Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Earthquake Emergency Recovery
            Project will relieve the socioeconomic hardships caused by
            the earthquakes in Kermanshah (April 2002), and in Qazvin,
            Zanjan, and Hamedan (June 2002), through the reconstruction
            of public, and private assets, and, by developing an
            effective monitoring, mitigation, and management system
            designed to reduce the impact of future earthquakes. The
            project will finance: a) reconstruction of housing, and
            social and public infrastructure; b) economic recovery to
            reduce vulnerability; c) capacity building and project
            management; and, d) disaster insurance preparation. The
            project will directly benefit affected populations, by
            supporting the restoration of economic activities, in
            particular, agricultural production, which is the main
            source of income in the affected areas. Technical assistance
            will provide wider public benefits, by strengthening the
            public sector capacity, to become responsive in the face of
            natural disasters. However, the major risk is the potential
            delay in project implementation, given limited knowledge of
            both the implementing agency in procurement procedures, and
            the Bank with Iranian authorities. To minimize this risk, at
            appraisal time, procurement training was provided to
            Government authorities, while finance management training
            will be provided to the Project Management Unit during
            implementation, in addition to intensive Bank supervision
            closely monitoring implementation. Furthermore, the
            insurance component creates another risk, in that it
            requires a separate committee and a working group, but
            provision of technical assistance, including studies,
            advisory services, and the preparation of a regulatory
            reform, should minimize this risk.
