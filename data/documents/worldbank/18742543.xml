under Category (3) is governed by the provisions of paragraph 9 of this Annex. The&#13;
Bank will engage one or more Monitoring Agents to monitor expenditures related to the&#13;
activities financed under Categories (1), (2) and (3). Each Monitoring Agent will be&#13;
selected and retained by the Bank on the basis of terms of reference/scope of work agreed&#13;
by the Management Committee and the Bank. The responsibilities of each Monitoring&#13;
Agent will include monitoring the procurement of goods, services and other items,&#13;
screening and recommending withdrawal applications for the Bank's approval and&#13;
payment, monitoring all expenditures financed by the Grant Funds and pre-screening the&#13;
financial management capacity of potential Sub-grant Recipients so as to ensure that&#13;
Grant Funds are disbursed only for the purposes specified in paragraph 4 of this Annex&#13;
and according to applicable Bank procedures.&#13;
(b)   Monitoring Agents will report to the Bank. Subject to the approval of the&#13;
Management Committee, the Bank will have the authority to change the terms of&#13;
reference/scope of work of each Monitoring Agent and, where justified, to replace each&#13;
Monitoring Agent with another firm or agency. The Bank will give advance notice to the&#13;
Administration, the Management Committee and the Donors of changes to the terms of&#13;
reference/scope of work of each Monitoring Agent. The Bank will perform ex-post&#13;
evaluations of the activities undertaken by the Monitoring Agents, and will, upon&#13;
completion of the activities financed under the Trust Fund, arrange for an independent&#13;
review of the performance of the Monitoring Agents and report its findings to the&#13;
Donors.&#13;
(c)   The Grant Funds may be used by the Bank to: (i) pay the reasonable fees,&#13;
travel and other reimbursable costs of Monitoring Agents; and (ii) pay the cost of goods,&#13;

the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" and the&#13;
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank&#13;
as Executing Agency".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿7.    The Bank's Use of Grant Funds and Administrative Cost Recovery&#13;
(a)   The Grant Funds will be accounted for as part of a single Trust Fund&#13;
which will be kept separate and apart from other funds of the Bank. Donor contributions&#13;
to the Trust Fund may not be earmarked for one or more specific Categories and will&#13;
instead be allocated among all Categories in accordance with the decisions of the&#13;
Management Committee. A Donor may state a preference that its contribution be used to&#13;
finance one or more Categories, or certain activities in a given sector, with the&#13;
understanding that neither the Management Committee nor the Bank will be in a position&#13;
to guarantee that total spending with respect to any given Category or sector will match&#13;
or exceed the level of the contribution in connection with which a preference will have&#13;
been stated.  Undesignated contributions will be allocated among Categories in&#13;
accordance with the decisions of the Management Committee. No contribution to the&#13;
Trust Fund will be accepted unless it equals or exceeds two hundred thousand United&#13;
States dollars (US$200,000).&#13;
(b)   The Bank may invest the Grant Funds pending their disbursement in any&#13;
instrument in which the Bank is authorized to invest its own funds. The investment&#13;
income earned on the Grant Funds pending disbursement will be added to the account to&#13;
be used for purposes of the Trust Fund.&#13;
(c)   In order to assist in the defrayment of its administrative costs, the Bank&#13;
may, as of February 18, 2011 following deposit of the Grant Funds, deduct from the T-&#13;
Account and transfer to itself an amount equivalent to two percent (2.0%) of the amount&#13;
of the Grant Funds. The Bank may also deduct from the T-Account and transfer to itself&#13;
the actual costs of the Bank's contract with the Monitoring Agent(s), as well as the cost&#13;
of the independent review of the Monitoring Agent(s)'s performance referred to under&#13;
paragraph 6(b) of this Annex.&#13;
8.    Fiduciary Responsibilities of the Bank&#13;
(a)   The Bank will be responsible only for performing those functions&#13;
specifically set forth in this Letter Agreement, including this Annex, and will not be&#13;
subject to any other duties or responsibilities to Donors, including, without limitation,&#13;
any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee under&#13;
general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Letter Agreement will be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of&#13;
Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved. The Bank will&#13;
have no responsibility to Donors with respect to the performance of the Monitoring&#13;
Agent(s) and will have no obligation to reimburse the Trust Fund or provide any&#13;
compensation to any Donor if the Grant Funds are not disbursed for the purposes&#13;
specified in this Annex as a result of actions of the Monitoring Agent(s).&#13;
(b)   Unless otherwise provided in this Letter Agreement, the Bank will apply&#13;
its normal financial management procedures to the Trust Fund. Such procedures&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿applicable to the operation of the Trust Fund will be communicated to the Donors without&#13;
delay.&#13;
(c)    Unless otherwise provided in this Letter Agreement, the Bank will apply&#13;
to the Trust Fund its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its&#13;
screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in&#13;
line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security&#13;
Council, taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. The Donor&#13;
acknowledges that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the&#13;
anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of&#13;
an individual member country that may apply to the Donor, nor will it be deemed a&#13;
waiver, express or implied, of any of the privileges and immunities of the Bank.&#13;
9.    Terms and Conditions Governing Sub-Grants Under Category (3&#13;
In the event that the Bank deems it necessary execute a sub-grant to carry out an&#13;

Recipient".&#13;
(b)   Except as provided in paragraph (c) below, responsibility for the&#13;
accounting and administration of Grant Funds made available by the Bank to Sub-grant&#13;
Recipients will be decided upon on a case-by-case basis by the Management Committee,&#13;
considering, inter ali  the recommendations made by the Monitoring Agent(s).&#13;
Accordingly, the Management Committee will review proposals to carry out activities&#13;
eligible for financing under Category (3) and award Sub-grants in connection with&#13;
proposals deemed by the Management Committee to be suitable for financing and&#13;
consistent with the Financing Strategy. Proposals for financing under Category (3) will&#13;
be submitted for approval to the Administration which, when approved, will forward&#13;
them to the Management Committee for consideration. Only proposals vetted by the&#13;
Administration in the manner described in this sub-paragraph will be considered by the&#13;
Management Committee. A proposal submitted to the Management Committee, through&#13;
the Administration, will include an appraisal of the Investment and Program Activity&#13;
sought to be financed. For those proposals that do not include an appraisal of the&#13;
Investment Project sought to be financed, the Bank will carry out the appraisal of the&#13;
Investment Project. The representative of a member organization of the Management&#13;
Committee will recuse him or herself from deliberations over the suitability of&#13;
proposal(s) submitted or co-financed by the organization that he or she represents.&#13;
(c)   Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (b) of this paragraph 9,&#13;
proposals to carry out a Law and Order Project may only be made and carried out by the&#13;
United Nations Development Programme. The latter will be the sole organization&#13;
authorized to carry out Law and Order Projects financed hereunder. Sub-grants to&#13;
finance Law and Order Projects will be made in accordance with terms and conditions&#13;
acceptable to the Bank including, without limitation, those set forth in sub-paragraphs (a),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

any Sub-grant made or to be made by the Bank to the United Nations Development&#13;
Programme for purposes of carrying out a Law and Order Project. UNDP, the Bank and&#13;
the Management Committee will agree on detailed procedures including procurement,&#13;
disbursements and audits for processing Law and Order Projects.&#13;
(d)   Sub-grants will be used to finance expenditures for goods, works and&#13;
services, as the case may be, in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" and the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency", as in effect at the&#13;

"Bank's Guidelines"). Any departure from the Bank's Guidelines will have to be pre-&#13;
approved by the Bank.&#13;
(e)   The fiduciary arrangements for an Investment and Program Activity to be&#13;
financed under Category (3) will be carried out in accordance with the guidelines and&#13;
procedures specified in paragraph 8 (b) including but not limited to an environmental and&#13;
social screening and assessment framework approved by the Bank. Any departure from&#13;
the guidelines contained in said framework will have to be pre-approved by the Bank.&#13;
(0    As required under regular Bank lending operations, a Sub-grant&#13;
Agreement will obligate a Sub-grant Recipient, among other things, to maintain an&#13;
appropriate and adequate financial management system, including records and accounts,&#13;
and prepare financial statements adequate to separately reflect the operations, resources&#13;
and expenditures related to the Investment and Program Activity financed under the Sub-&#13;
grant. Within ninety (90) days of each June 30 and December 31, the Sub-grant&#13;
Recipient will prepare unaudited financial statements with respect to such Sub-grant and&#13;
forward a copy to the Bank. All financial statements appropriate to the size and purpose&#13;
of the Sub-grant, as indicated in the Sub-grant agreement will be expressed in the&#13;
currency in which the Sub-grant is made, as indicated in the Sub-grant Agreement, and&#13;
will show the allocation of such funds among the activities financed by the Sub-grant. In&#13;
addition, the Sub-grant Recipient will: (i) have the above-mentioned records, accounts&#13;
and financial statements audited, in accordance with auditing standards acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (ii) furnish to the Bank, as soon as&#13;
available, but in any case not later than six (6) months after the end of each calendar year:&#13;
(a) certified copies of the financial statements referred to above for such year as so&#13;
audited, and (b) an opinion on such statements, records and accounts and report of such&#13;
audit, by said auditors, of such scope and in such detail as the Bank will have reasonably&#13;
requested; and (iii) furnish to the Bank such other information concerning said records&#13;
and accounts, and the audit thereof, as the Bank will from time to time reasonably&#13;
request. In such cases where the Sub-grant is 5 US$100,000 the Bank has the discretion&#13;
to specify in the Sub-grant agreement that attestation from the Monitoring Agent will be&#13;
sufficient to comply with the audit procedures above.&#13;
(g)   The Bank will report quarterly to the Donors on the status of Grant Funds&#13;
made available to a Sub-grant Recipient under a Sub-grant Agreement. In addition, at a&#13;

the aggregate Grant Funds for the agreed activities and disbursements made therefrom to&#13;
the Monitoring Agent(s). Within one hundred eighty (180) days of the completion of the&#13;
activities financed by the Grant Funds, the Bank will prepare unaudited financial&#13;
statements in United States dollars with respect to the Grant Funds and forward a copy to&#13;
each Donor. The Bank will provide the Donors annually with a management assertion&#13;
together with an attestation from the Bank's external auditors on the satisfactory&#13;
performance of the procedures and controls used by the Bank in administering the Grant&#13;
Funds.&#13;
(b)   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement&#13;
audit by the Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall&#13;
first consult as to whether such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor&#13;
shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of reference of such audit. Following&#13;
agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange for such external&#13;
audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect&#13;
to such audit, shall be paid by the requesting Donor.&#13;
11.   Progress Reportin2 Responsibilities of the Bank&#13;
(a)   The Bank will maintain close consultation and coordination with the&#13;
Donors. The Bank will provide each Donor with quarterly reports on its quarterly ex-&#13;
post evaluation of the activities undertaken by the Monitoring Agent(s) including&#13;
disbursements made out of the Grant Funds. Within (6) six months of the completion of&#13;
the activities, or of full disbursement of the Grant Funds, whichever comes later, the&#13;
Bank will provide a final progress report to each Donor, together with a copy of the&#13;
independent review of the performance of the Monitoring Agent(s). Upon request by any&#13;
Donor, the Bank will send to such Donor the draft and final reports received by the Bank&#13;
from each Monitoring Agent on the activities financed by the Grant Funds.&#13;
(b)   Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund.&#13;
The Donor and the Bank shall agree on the scope and conduct of such review or&#13;
evaluation and the Bank shall provide all relevant information within the limits of its&#13;
policies and procedures. All associated costs shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood&#13;
that any such review or evaluation will not constitute a financial, compliance or other&#13;
audit of the Trust Fund and will be separate from any independent evaluation of the Trust&#13;
Fund to be arranged by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿12.   Termination&#13;
Unless otherwise agreed by the Donors and the Bank, the Trust Fund arrangement&#13;
provided for under the Letter Agreement and this Annex will expire on June 30, 2020. If&#13;
at any time, either party determines that the purposes of the Letter Agreement and this&#13;
Annex can no longer be effectively or appropriately carried out, this Letter Agreement&#13;
may be terminated at the initiative of either party by giving the other party thirty (30)&#13;
days prior notice to this affect. Upon termination, unless otherwise agreed by the Donors&#13;
and the Bank: (i) any agreement entered into among the Bank,' the Monitoring Agent(s),&#13;
and/or other third parties will not be affected by the termination, and the Bank will be&#13;
entitled to continue permitting withdrawals of Grant Funds in respect of such agreements&#13;
as if this arrangement had not been so terminated; and (ii) any remaining Grant Funds&#13;
will be returned to the Donors on a pro-rata basis, and the Bank's functions pursuant&#13;

separate sub-grant agreements to be entered into between the Bank, on the one part, and&#13;
sub-grant Recipients, on the other part, with each such agreement relating to one or more&#13;
