EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                                                  sanitation challenges but was clearly instrumental in open-&#13;
Urban sanitation problems are technically, socially and            ing a Government-owned pathway towards addressing the&#13;
managerially complex. Building up over many years as cities        challenges. What were the key drivers for change, and what&#13;
develop rapidly and often informally, the result is often a        lessons can be drawn from this experience for other coun-&#13;
mix of on-site and off-site infrastructure, some of it obsolete    tries? As a follow up to an earlier stocktaking of ISSDP&#13;
and much of it poorly maintained, with only a small                implementation, this field note explores key design and&#13;
percentage of wastewater being treated and disposed of             implementation lessons including:&#13;
safely. Rarely do cities present a blank canvas upon which&#13;
new infrastructure and services can be drawn. Planning for         â&#128;¢ Designing to suit local circumstances&#13;
city-wide sanitation improvements is a daunting task and it        â&#128;¢ Adopting a holistic view of technical assistance&#13;
is not surprising that local authorities, which often lack         â&#128;¢ Using a range of measures for creating an enabling&#13;
expert human resources, tend to opt for a blueprint                  environment&#13;
approach based on major (and often unaffordable) new               â&#128;¢ Promoting strategic planning as a management tool&#13;
investments rather than assessing what already exists and          â&#128;¢ Ensuring quality in advocacy and communications&#13;
exploring how it might be improved.&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia has for decades experienced the challenges&#13;
outlined above. While 73 percent of urban households have&#13;
access to a private toilet facility, severe under-investment in&#13;
public sanitation infrastructure has resulted in one of the&#13;
lowest sewerage coverage levels in Asia, with most excreta&#13;
and wastewater discharged untreated or semi-treated into&#13;
local drains or water bodies, causing massive environmental&#13;
pollution. Dense housing areas and severe seasonal flooding,&#13;
exacerbated by the choking of drains with uncollected solid&#13;
waste, has only added to the problem.&#13;
&#13;
Against this backdrop of very limited progress, the Indone-&#13;
sia Sanitation Sector Development Program (ISSDP) oper-&#13;
ated from 2006 to 2010. By the time the program ended in&#13;
January 2010, Government commitment to urban sanita-&#13;
tion had grown remarkably: 12 cities had developed city&#13;
sanitation strategies and started to implement them, govern-&#13;
ment budgets for sanitation had increased by 300 percent,&#13;
and a national roadmap entitled â&#128;&#156;Accelerated Development&#13;
of Sanitation in Human Settlements 2010-2014â&#128;&#157; contain-&#13;
ing commitments to scale up the ISSDP approach in over&#13;
300 cities had been formally adopted by the Government.&#13;
&#13;
ISSDP was not able to resolve all of Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s urban&#13;

Earlier in this decade, the Government of Indonesia had                         Furthermore, unofficial policy was to treat sanitation as&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
    Box 1: Building on the strategic sanitation approach&#13;
    In developing the city planning component, ISSDP drew on lessons from earlier urban sanitation programs, particularly in Asia, as&#13;
    captured in the publication, Urban Sanitation: A Guide to Strategic Planning by Kevin Tayler et al (2003). This book in turn built&#13;
    upon, and modified, the principles of the Strategic Sanitation Approach developed by WSP in Africa in 1997. The planning process&#13;
    developed under ISSDP, drawing on these references, was built on the principles that:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢ local planning should begin with a detailed investigation of the infrastructure and services that already exist, avoiding gross&#13;
      assumptions or a â&#128;&#152;blueprintâ&#128;&#153; approach that treats the city as a blank sheet;&#13;
    â&#128;¢ the way forward probably lies in incremental steps rather than massive, one-off investments (the â&#128;&#152;small stepsâ&#128;&#153; approach); and&#13;
    â&#128;¢ plans should respond to user demand, but this demand should be investigated, not assumed, and service users should be empow-&#13;
      ered to make informed decisions.&#13;
&#13;
    While the program took inspiration from Tayler, the process that evolved was new and responsive to local conditions, and the merits&#13;
    or otherwise of the Strategic Sanitation Approach were not a part of the ISSDP teamâ&#128;&#153;s ongoing dialogue with government.&#13;

The first step in the formulation of a city sanitation strategy         The process recognized the need both for strategic, city-wide&#13;

interest in sanitation. The planning process that followed              optimized both aspects in a â&#128;&#152;top-down meets bottom-upâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
was founded on a detailed assessment of existing infrastruc-            approach to planning. This was consistent with govern-&#13;
ture and services, including user perceptions of the services;          mentâ&#128;&#153;s annual musrenbang process whereby development&#13;
see box 2 below.                                                        proposals from neighborhood groups were collated and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Box 2: The city sanitation planning process&#13;
  The strategic planning process developed under ISSDP began with an assessment of existing infrastructure and services in each ward&#13;
  (kelurahan) of the city. This involved three discrete steps:&#13;
&#13;
  Step one: Secondary data analysis&#13;
  This entailed an examination of available data for each kelurahan, while recognizing that it may not be complete or reliable. Three&#13;
  broad types of information were examined:&#13;
&#13;
  1. The number of households formally designated as poor, since poverty affects access to sanitation facilities, bearing in mind that&#13;
     most services are self-provided.&#13;
  2. Population density. This can have a strong influence on the severity of sanitary problems and consequently the health risk.&#13;
  3. Technical data on the coverage of water and sanitation services, and the level of service provided (shared or household taps, on-site&#13;
     sanitation or sewerage, etc.)&#13;
&#13;
  A weighting factor was assigned to each of these parameters.&#13;
&#13;
  Step two: Primary data collection&#13;
  A participatory survey termed Environmental Health Risk Assessment (EHRA) was conducted in sample kelurahan that had a&#13;
  relatively high proportion of low-income households. The survey and observations involved groups of women from these locations,&#13;
  who made a health risk assessment of their neighborhood, with assistance from municipal and program staff. The assessment consid-&#13;
  ered the condition of, and access to, water and sanitation facilities, and established the baseline status of hygiene behavior in key&#13;
  areas such as handwashing with soap, the handling of childrenâ&#128;&#153;s faces and solid waste management in the home. The findings&#13;
  enabled the identification of priority areas within the city and provided insights into both the impact of poor sanitation at household&#13;
  level and potential improvement strategies.&#13;
&#13;
  Step three: Professional assessment&#13;
  Members of the pokja added their own perception of public health risk areas based on their knowledge of the town and professional&#13;
  expertise.&#13;
&#13;
  In the last stage of the analysis, the information gathered was used to produce a set of maps which divided the city into zones based&#13;
  on 4 levels of public health risks. Priority locations were not always obvious, partly because poorer residents were not always found&#13;
  in large clusters; most neighborhoods contained a range of income groups. It was for this reason that ISSDP did not target the poor&#13;
  as a separate group but adopted a â&#128;&#152;poor-inclusiveâ&#128;&#153; approach to planning.&#13;
&#13;
  Finally, the information and analysis for each city was collated in a document which became known as the â&#128;&#152;White Bookâ&#128;&#153; due to the&#13;
  format in which it was first presented. Each white book included a wealth of baseline information on existing infrastructure and&#13;
  services, budgetary information and analysis of some issues. This information provided the basis for formulation of a city-wide&#13;
  strategy to tackle the problems identified.&#13;

Coordination and investment framework (Output 2)                        national awareness campaigns targeting specific groups, and&#13;
This component, developed directly by WSP, aimed at                     cities were assisted with short awareness and communication&#13;
improving donor support of the Government's urban and                   activities, including community consultation on sanitation&#13;
rural sanitation strategy and programs, and also the develop-           needs and preferences. It became clear, however, that there&#13;
ment of a sanitation investment and financing framework. In             was little to gain from launching national or city level&#13;
mid 2007, a sanitation donor group was formed which                     promotional campaigns before strategies and resources were&#13;
continues to meet on a regular basis. Government has                    in place to respond to demand for improved sanitation,&#13;
become an active player at the forum and sees it as useful way          should it be generated. Much of the promotional activity&#13;
to communicate and discuss issues with all donors. The                  could only be carried out, therefore, once a certain stage had&#13;
bimonthly meetings are well attended and focus on particu-              been reached in national sanitation strategy development&#13;
lar themes and topics of mutual interest, and have success-             and city planning. For this reason, there was no separate&#13;
fully improved relationships, communication, and coordina-              promotional component for awareness campaigns in Phase&#13;
tion, including sharing of research findings and evaluations,           II. Instead, program communications concentrated on&#13;
as well as joint commissioning of research studies.                     policy advocacy targeting government decision makers&#13;
                                                                        rather than service users.&#13;
While the development of a sanitation financing and invest-&#13;
ment framework was considered an important sector tool by               Meanwhile, the public-private partnership for hand washing&#13;
the donors, the same prioritization was not shared by                   with soap initiative continued to operate independently, via&#13;
Government and thus not pursued further following inten-                the Ministry of Health. This was not explicitly linked to the&#13;
sive discussions among stakeholders.                                    city planning work in selected cities except when special&#13;
                                                                        promotional events were held on global hand washing day;&#13;
Promotional campaigns (Output 3)                                        see Box 3.&#13;
During Phase I, preliminary work began on the design of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Box 3: Hand Washing With Soap (HWWS)&#13;
  It has been established that soap is almost universally affordable in Indonesia and even very poor families use it. The challenge is to&#13;
  increase the frequency of handwashing with soap at critical times in order to reduce the incidence of diarrheal disease, in line with&#13;
  government targets.&#13;
&#13;
  ISSDP developed a communications strategy for HWWS and this became an initiative in its own right, independently operated by&#13;
  a coordinator appointed by WSP together with Ministry of Health. It is informally linked to the global HWWS program and&#13;
  participates in meetings and video conferences of the Global Handwashing Initiative.&#13;
&#13;
  A national HWWS Public Private Partnership core group was established under the Ministry of Health with representation from&#13;
  the Bappenas, WHO, UNICEF, USAID and the companies Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser. With the help of its coordinator, this&#13;
  group developed a common national framework for HWWS promotion and adopted a national logo that brought together isolated&#13;
  HWWS initiatives under one umbrella. This helped to improve efficiency, ensure a coordinated approach and facilitate mutual&#13;
  support and learning among the various stakeholders. Based on formative research, the coordinator used the ISSDP HWWS&#13;
  communications strategy to develop media messages and publications, and organized high-profile media events. As with ISSDP&#13;
  itself, the focus of support was on creating an enabling environment for the promotion of HWWS, rather than undertaking the&#13;
  promotion directly.&#13;
&#13;
  As in most countries, partnerships in hygiene promotion and Corporate Social Responsibility are new in Indonesia and, not surpris-&#13;
  ingly, it took some time for government and private sector partners to work together effectively - both were wary at first. The&#13;
  relationship proved to be fruitful, however: not only did the companies continue to fund promotional campaigns which were imple-&#13;
  mented by local NGOs; but they also brought considerable promotional expertise to the initiative, and adopted detailed quality&#13;
  assurance procedures in the use of promotional tools and techniques. Exposure to this expertise has been very beneficial to the&#13;
  Ministry of Health and other government actors involved.&#13;

&amp;#12;3. Outcomes&#13;
&#13;
ISSDP had a slow start, partly because it took time to               commitment to urban sanitation was at its highest level for&#13;
identify appropriate personnel for some key project                  many years. Progress against key indicators in the program&#13;
positions, but also because the task itself was complicated          document confirmed that the program purpose has been&#13;
and the way forward was not obvious; for many people                 largely achieved; see Table 3.&#13;
involved - both program staff and government partners - it&#13;
was difficult to grasp what it meant in practical terms to           3.1 City sanitation planning&#13;
create an â&#128;&#152;enabling frameworkâ&#128;&#153; for the sector. This meant            ISSDP tried, through the planning process, to address&#13;
that the program was a learning exercise for all involved. The       head-on the shortcomings of the existing sanitation services&#13;
active engagement of the SanTT was also limited at first,            environment in the cities, particularly poor inter-&#13;
partly because its lack of formal status led some members to         departmental coordination, a history of ad hoc, supply-&#13;
regard its work as informal, with no binding implications            driven investments and a lack of essential information for&#13;
(this was later resolved through official recognition of the         decision-making. When the program ended, the 6 cities&#13;

As the city level work began to show progress, and national          produced them with formal adoption pending from the&#13;
advocacy became more effective, the program began to                 mayor and city governing council. A status summary for&#13;

Banjarmasin        CSS formally adopted and action plan incorporated into annual municipal budget. This municipality is&#13;
(600,000)          very concerned with wastewater management and action post-CSS included development of a sewer-&#13;
                   age master plan, which was funded using the cityâ&#128;&#153;s own resources.&#13;
                   The city is receiving AusAID assistance via the Indonesia Infrastructure Initiative (IndII) for the develop-&#13;
                   ment of a Business Plan for PD PAL, the local wastewater company. It is awaiting further AusAID&#13;
                   funding for house connections under an output-based aid (OBA) scheme for poor households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Blitar             CSS formally adopted and action plan incorporated into annual municipal budget. This municipality is&#13;
(127,000)          focusing on a community development approach using the cityâ&#128;&#153;s own resources; it is not looking for&#13;
                   large-scale external funding, though the delays in launching through the same trust fund small pilots&#13;
                   caused some disappointment. A number of local projects are being integrated into a poverty alleviation&#13;
                   movement known as the War Movement for Fighting Poverty. During ISSDP Phase II, Blitar served as a&#13;
                   center of excellence for nearby cities that had recently joined the program.&#13;
                   To sustain and strengthen work on sanitation, the municipality has facilitated the establishment of&#13;
                   sub-district and neighborhood sanitation pokjas. It has also used the CSS as the basis of a proposal to&#13;
                   the provincial government for the co-funding of some sanitation activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Denpasar           CSS formally adopted and action plan incorporated into annual municipal budget. The capital of Bali is&#13;
(560,000)          beneï¬&#129;ting from a number of projects that have been brought under the umbrella of the CSS. They&#13;
                   include a JICA-funded Denpasar Sewerage Development Project; â&#128;&#152;Sarbagita,â&#128;&#153; a regional waste-to-&#13;
                   energy project covering 4 local governments (Denpasar, Badung, Gianyar and Tabanan), which will sell&#13;
                   power back to the grid; a number of small recycling and composting initiatives; and an integrated&#13;
                   sanitation pilot project called â&#128;&#152;Santimaduâ&#128;&#153; in a priority neighborhood. This combines solid waste&#13;
                   management, drainage and wastewater and emphasizes community involvement. It is funded from the&#13;
                   cityâ&#128;&#153;s own resources.&#13;

Jambi              CSS formally adopted, allocated IDR 4 billion (approximately USD 420,000) in municipal budget 2010&#13;
(450,000)          and to be included in Local Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJM-D) and Medium-Term Investment&#13;
                   Plan (RPJM). Jambi chairs AKKOPSI, a recently formed network of districts and cities concerned about&#13;
                   sanitation, which facilitates the sharing of information and lessons. The role of the municipal sanitation&#13;
                   pokja is being formalized, with a name change to â&#128;&#152;Sanitation Coordination Team of Jambi Cityâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;

Payakumbuh         CSS formally adopted and action plan incorporated into annual municipal budget. The mayor of Paya-&#13;
(105,000)          kumbuh is one of the foremost promoters of sanitation in Indonesia. The city received a Healthy City&#13;
                   Award in late 2009 from the Minister of Health and has launched a campaign to assist 1,000 poor&#13;
                   families in getting hygienic toilets. The municipality is also advocating for the establishment of a regional&#13;
                   waste disposal site.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Surakarta          CSS formally adopted and the action plan incorporated into the annual municipal budget. Corporate&#13;
(660,000)          social responsibility schemes have been negotiated and funds are being provided by a local company&#13;
                   and Unilever for wastafel (hand washing facilities) near cafes in the city park area. The municipality is&#13;
                   also cooperating with the NGO Rotary Club in providing public toilets in a low-income area, and awaiting&#13;
                   AusAID funding under and output-based aid (OBA) scheme for the extension of waste-water connec-&#13;

  Box 4: Lessons from Denpasar municipality, Bali&#13;
  Representatives of Denpasar municipal planning department (Bappeda) reported that, by March 2010, the city sanitation strategy&#13;
  had not been forgotten as the action plan arising from it had been accommodated in the municipal budget. In addition a sewerage&#13;
  master plan had now been developed, but within the framework of the city sanitation strategy.&#13;
&#13;
  The 2010 action plan focused on developing small wastewater treatment plants for locations beyond the reach of the ongoing JICA-&#13;
  funded Sewerage Development Program, and on increasing the number of house connections to the sewerage system, in support of&#13;
  which connection fees would be waived. (Denpasar is a rare case in Indonesia of a city developing a sewerage network.)&#13;
&#13;
  The greatest benefit of the planning process was, according to these officers, that it had facilitated inter-agency coordination and&#13;
  prompted other departments to put sanitation on their agendas.&#13;

  Government allocations for sanitation had improved at all levels over the course of ISSDP though it remained a struggle to get funds&#13;
  released, and delays with the launch of small pilots were frustrating.&#13;
&#13;
  The program also benefited from a proactive mayor with a keen interest in sanitation, who launched his own â&#128;&#152;Comfortable City&#13;
  Projectâ&#128;&#153; which bundled together a number of small initiatives. While ensuring the municipality did what it could, he also saw the&#13;
  need for community action - government could not do everything.&#13;

findings of the planning process, but ISSDP experience suggests     processes running through ISSDP: the program activities&#13;

    Box 5: The Economics of Sanitation Initiative&#13;
    The Economics of Sanitation Initiative2 examined the major health, water, environmental, tourism and other welfare impacts associ-&#13;
    ated with poor sanitation in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Lao PDR and Vietnam. The study focused mainly on a narrow&#13;
    definition of sanitation: human excreta management and related hygiene practices.&#13;
    The study found that in 2006, Indonesia lost USD 6.3 billion due to poor sanitation and hygiene, equivalent to approximately 2.3&#13;
    percent of gross domestic product (GDP).&#13;
    Poor sanitation, including hygiene, causes at least 120 million disease episodes and 50,000 premature deaths annually. The resulting&#13;
    economic impact stands at USD 3.3 billion per year.&#13;
    Poor sanitation also contributes significantly to water pollution, adding to the cost of safe water for households, and reducing the&#13;
    production of fish in rivers and lakes. The associated economic costs of polluted water attributed to poor sanitation exceed USD 1.5&#13;
    billion per year. Poor sanitation also contributes up to USD 1.2 billion per year in population welfare losses (due to additional time&#13;
    required to access unimproved sanitation), USD 166 million per year in tourism losses, and USD 96 million in environmental losses&#13;
    due to loss of productive land.&#13;

            Lessons in urban sanitation development :
            Indonesia sanitation sector development program 2006-2010
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            At national level, program efforts
            focused on advocacy for, and support to, sanitation policy
            and strategy development, improved sector coordination and
            the establishment of an investment framework. At city level,
            the program provided capacity building support to
            municipalities with a strong emphasis on the strategic
            planning of sanitation improvements. Indonesia Sanitation
            Sector Development Program (ISSDP) was an unusual initiative
            in that, while it was concerned with urban sanitation
            improvements, it did not make investments directly, focusing
            instead on advocacy and technical assistance. The program
            was designed to suit the Indonesian context: while the
            government wanted to make progress in sanitation, an earlier
            debt crisis had made it reluctant to take on infrastructure
            loans from multilateral agencies, apart from which the
            introduction of decentralization and regional autonomy in
            2001 meant that primary responsibility for sanitation was
            shifting from the center to local level. Furthermore,
            unofficial policy was to treat sanitation as essentially a
            private matter, with households responsible for capital
            investment and operations. It is important to note that most
            Indonesian cities do not have distinct slum areas; higher-
            and lower-income households are interspersed within the same
            neighborhoods and poor sanitation is therefore a problem for
            everyone, highlighting the need to address it as a city-wide
            issue, not on a neighborhood or piecemeal basis.
