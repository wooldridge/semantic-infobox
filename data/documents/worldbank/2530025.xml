            Drawing on the World Bank's Private
            Participation in Infrastructure Project Database, this Note
            provides an overview of private activity in infrastructure
            in developing countries between 1990 and 2000. Three main
            trends characterized that decade: Private activity in
            infrastructure grew each year except 1998 and 1999. Most
            developing countries introduced some form of private
            activity in infrastructure. But Latin America and East Asia
            captured most of the investment. The 1990s marked the
            reemergence of private participation in infrastructure in
            the developing world after decades of nationalization and
            public sector management. Between 1990 and 2000, 130
            developing countries had infrastructure projects with
            private participation, and 54 of them introduced private
            participation in at least three infrastructure sectors.
            During that decade developing country governments
            transferred to the private sector the operating or
            construction risk, or both, for more than 2,300
            infrastructure projects and attracted investment commitments
            of almost US$690 billion.1 Those projects were implemented
            under a range of schemes: management contracts,
            divestitures, and greenfield facilities (build-operate-own
            contracts, build-operate-transfer contracts, and merchant facilities).
