COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENT&#13;
relating to&#13;
Global Infrastructure Facility Partnership Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
This Collaboration Arrangement is entered into on October 9, 2014 between:&#13;
(1)   SWISS RE LTD, herein reprEsented by its Group Chief Investment Officer, Member of the&#13;
Executive Committee, and hE adquartered at Mythenquai 50/60, 8022 Zurich, Switzerland " ;' iss&#13;
Re"); and&#13;
(2)   THE WORLD BANK GROUP, comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPI i r T&#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), heac quartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, Ur , he&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION, ("IFC") headquartered at 2121 Pennsylvar i;l&#13;
Avenue, NW, Washington, D C 20433, USA, and the MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT&#13;
GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("MIGA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC  133,&#13;
USA (the "World Bank Group")&#13;
(each a "Party" and together the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad internationa recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Inter i;1t -nal&#13;
Organizations (IOs), the G77, and the private sector represented by the B20 that investir ) ii the&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging IVarkets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to e: nd&#13;
access to basic services and raise living standards for all, and to meet global economic (1r: vth&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need presents a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on Jr::ing&#13;
sources of infrastructure finance-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and coo ar ted&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize p-ivate sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of robt st pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects an I th 3 is&#13;
understood to be the greates: barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investm . It&#13;
(D) Governments, development Iinance institutions, donors, and private investors share an in rE t in&#13;
developing the market for private infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand s c , in&#13;
the numbers of structurally sound and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual em ilg: ice&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a recognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range o :ri 'ate&#13;
investors that actively partic pate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals wil ;e iefit&#13;
from collective action betwean this range of entities-to leverage resources and know: ! to&#13;
find solutions to complex i1frastructure financing challenges that no single institutio,i c uld&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, thE Parties propose the establishment of a Global InfrastructurE FE. ility&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF") The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at leveraiil' the&#13;
efforts of the wide range of i istitutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastruct i=e vith&#13;
the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project pree rm Ion,&#13;
structuring, and  risk mitigation for individual infrastructure  investments. In this regard, t  3IF&#13;
aims to complement existinj and proposed services and initiatives currently supportec :n the&#13;
Parties and other prospective GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prep; r: /ell-&#13;
structured, infrastructure prcjects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for acces ii ii: the&#13;
expertise of the Parties and other GIF partners, in combination with guidance from pro :1E tive&#13;
private sector financiers into project structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater I: rE age&#13;
of official resources in the fE ce of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular  i rge&#13;
and complex projects with th a potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(F) The  Parties are now  interested  in collaborating in developing the Global Infrastructure 1:,,ility&#13;
Partnership Program, togeth -r with other partners.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Accordingly, the Parties have com. to the following understanding:&#13;
1     Global Infrastructure Facili-;y Partnership Program Framework&#13;
1.1   The GIF is intended io be based on the preliminary objectives and principles set o.i&#13;
Annex 1 (Preliminary GIF Fo indational Principles). The Parties acknowledge their mutual&#13;
understanding that while the 31F Foundational Principles are an initial basis for their colla oc r :ion,&#13;
they are of an indicative natu,e and will continue to be developed amongst the Parties anc ,i: I&#13;
other potential partners until he GIF is formally established. The final version of these obji c li, 3s&#13;
and principles will be agreed upon by the GIF Partners and be reflected in the agreement&#13;
establishing the GIF.&#13;
1.2   The Parties intend to work together with any additional participants who may be&#13;
collaborating on the GIF to further enhance their coordination, in particular by developing t I IlF,&#13;
with a view to formally establ shing the program by December 2014.&#13;
2     Further Collaboration&#13;
2.1   Pursuant to the foregoing, the Parties will use reasonable endeavors to continue t&#13;
collaborate in developing the GIF, including but not limited to:&#13;
a. Nature and scope of collaboration under the GIF, such as proposed categories of&#13;
partnership and the r:les, rights, and responsibilities associated with each catego y&#13;
b. Governance arrange nents of the GIF;&#13;
c. Operational policies ipplicable to the GIF's operations;&#13;
d. Scope of GIF activities and sources/uses of GIF funds, including approach to proji cI:&#13;
selection criteria and coordination with the Parties' existing facilities; and&#13;
e. Any other aspects of collaboration required to finalize the design of the GIF, incluc ir&#13;
sharing best practice and experience with regard to project preparation, through tt Li e&#13;
of knowledge platforms for the infrastructure sector.&#13;
2.2   During the process of finali; ing the design of the GIF, the multilateral development bani E Ii ted&#13;
in Annex 2 will be invited lo participate as initial Technical Partners. Once the GIF d i: 1 is&#13;
finalized, additional collabo ative efforts are required to develop the operational detailr or the&#13;
GIF, at all times complementing existing efforts and facilities and building upon the 1 red&#13;
knowledge and experience of the Parties in this area. This includes determining the E vi I of&#13;
coordination between the Porties and project origination process.&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
Preliminary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the 31F is to promote private sector investment in infrastructUre p (J: :ts&#13;
in emerging markets and de% eloping economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparat:-I&#13;
provision of appropriate risk mitigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commerci :ii&#13;
institutional investor engagement in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex pub ic-private partnerships and projects with potential for comme cE&#13;
viability which require project preparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastrL c:L 3&#13;
financing solutions that no single institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF aims to create a global platform to provide financial and coon i HI Ion&#13;
resources in collaboration wi h the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of t: v, de&#13;
range of donor and development finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMO::&#13;
infrastructure, with the input and ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engageme il ( uld&#13;
stretch from upstream suppo I on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to downstream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and risi&#13;
mitigation/credit enhancemei it.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer term by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structurE d&#13;
infrastructure projects, the G F can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset class attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking lone . - n&#13;
assets in faster growing ecor omies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment oprortunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment p,ofilk&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to o)erate according to the following core principles, to be finalizi i. )on&#13;
agreement among GIF partners:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the private sector-specializing in project financing modalities ti at 'ill&#13;
draw together ccmparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing public goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly thost&#13;
infrastructure prcjects that are climate friendly or trade enabling;&#13;
(iii) Promoting sustainability and inclusiveness-ensuring projects adhere to I Es:&#13;
practice standards for social and environmental responsibility; and&#13;
(iv) Collaborating, c omplementing and partnering for solutions-mobilizing tb c h ical&#13;
and financial res)urces of all partner entities-World Bank Group entities, mu 1:i al ral&#13;
development ins :itutions, other public institutions, and private investors-in ar&#13;
innovative and fl 3xible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve great( r&#13;
leverage and address the complex infrastructure financing challenges that arE&#13;
beyond the reso irces of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements and Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expected to involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in t 10&#13;
development and implementition of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF p  r.r rs&#13;
are expected to fall into one ,r more of the following categories:&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(i) Funding Partners-Partners that provide financial contributions to the GIF wi I&#13;
considered Fund ng Partners.&#13;
(ii) Technical Partnirs-Partners that can and who will agree to provide specific&#13;
technical advice ind support to GIF activities including execution of GIF-funde :&#13;
activities and/or provision of GIF-backed credit enhancement or liquidity suppc r&#13;
instruments.&#13;
(iii) Advisory Partne rs-Private investors or entities that represent the voice of&#13;
commercial and/or institutional investment, whether pension funds, insurance&#13;
companies, sove-eign wealth funds, banks or other financial institutions, as w( II E&#13;
other multilateral or bilateral agencies engaged in supporting private sector&#13;
infrastructure prclects, to be invited into discussions related to project prepara or&#13;
optimal approaches to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, with a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial and/or&#13;
institutional investment.&#13;
3.2   A GIF Governing Cc uncil is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic programmin]&#13;
management and use of funcs, and development of operational policies and procedures; E:1&#13;
hold the GIF Management Unit (see section 4.1) accountable for delivering on the facility's&#13;
objectives and principles, with advice and support from the Advisory Partners. The compo i io i of&#13;
the Governing Council will be agreed between IBRD and prospective partners, but is propE e: to&#13;
comprise representatives of Funding and Technical Partners.&#13;
3.3   An Advisory Counc I comprised of all GIF partners, chaired by the Managing Din c tc&#13;
and Chief Financial Officer ol the World Bank Group, will be periodically convened to facili a:E&#13;
coordination of GIF activities and support GIF operations. This Advisory Council will serve :a&#13;
sounding board, providing gu dance and support for GIF Management, and in particular wi I ii&#13;
view to ensuring suitability of projects for private sector investment.&#13;
4     Management&#13;
4.1   The GIF will be admi iistered by the World Bank Group, through a small, dedicatel  m&#13;
established for this purpose (:he GIF Management Unit). The GIF Management Unit will fL -i:1i n&#13;
as a coordinating body as projects are identified for inclusion in the pipeline, and then mo% v&#13;
toward technical support and financing phases. The GIF Management Unit will not lead in( i i: jal&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.2   GIF activity implementation teams will be led by selected staff of Technical Partne&#13;
institutions, coordinated by tle GIF Management Unit in consultation with client governme rs&#13;
according to specific project iequirements and the project origination processes. Compos Ii:r of&#13;
the implementation teams may vary according to the need of individual projects and gove nIn nts.&#13;
5     Activities and Projects&#13;
5.1   Project selection criteria and processes could be developed to reflect the follow i'g&#13;
principles:&#13;
(i) Development Inipact-projects that support the development goals of the GI"&#13;
partner institutions;&#13;
(ii) Alignment-pro ects that are aligned with recipient/sponsor country prior ties a-:&#13;
strategies;&#13;
(iii) Complexity-pr)jects that require multiple parties to come together to provid&#13;
structuring, arrar ging and financial support, and/or projects which require a bI . Id of&#13;
financial instrum mts; and&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic impac:-projects that have significant potential to achieve financial /  I ility,&#13;
leverage public f inds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors- s u: 1&#13;
as through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's se vice delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrastr icture investments that have global public good characteristic E, ; ich&#13;
as climate friendly-project; that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provisior :1&#13;
infrastructure services; and tiade enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconne:Ji. y&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of suppcrt provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, with E v 3w&#13;
to complementing the resourl.es and support already available from partner entities and oi 1&#13;
funding mechanisms. During the GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following ac li sil,&#13;
corresponding to major proje.t development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definition and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; pro ect definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility scr  : i g;&#13;
and legal, regula:ory, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii)  Project preparati &gt;n and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and PPP structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction supfort and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, anc design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arrangi ig and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financ 1;&#13;
packages from a range of sources and partners.&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies- ncluding in particular the management of environmental and ;:(: al&#13;
impacts and risks, and transr arency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastr ct. e&#13;
projects in supporting sustair able, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial, reputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supported operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements cr&#13;
external implementing entitie; under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an ar proach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards an( )t er&#13;
standards and policies, and cevelop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for GP&#13;
Technical Partners who are expected to function as implementing entities for GIF activities&#13;
