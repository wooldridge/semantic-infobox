            Rising informality
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            By some estimates more than 30 percent
            of the developing world's GDP and 70 percent of its
            workers are outside the official economy. The implications:
            Most small firms are trapped in low-productivity operations
            with little access to finance, key government services, and
            formal customers. Workers lack safety and social protection.
            And bigger, better-connected firms use unfair informal
            practices to beat out more productive formal competitors.
            The result is slower economic growth and a growing social
            divide between the informal and formal parts of society.
