Note No. 41    Cash Constraints and Credit Corsets:&#13;
The Chimera of Interenterprise Credit&#13;
Timothy Conzdon    The rapid buildup of interenterprise credit in many Central and Eastern European countries is&#13;
S.d Ramchndan often seen as a major problem that governments must fix. We argue that these arrears rise only&#13;
S. Rcamachanldran&#13;
temporarily as the hard budget constraint on enterprises tightens, and that they will soon auto-&#13;
matically plateau. Thus, although unpaid arrears are a problem for the creditor, they do not cause&#13;
major macroeconomic disruptions unless panicky governments react inappropriately. Indeed,&#13;
crafty enterprises may exaggerate the size and danger of arrears so that they will be bailed out.&#13;

            The buildup of interenterprise credit in
            many Central and Eastern European countries is often seen as
            a problem that requires a government bailout. The authors
            show that arrears rise only temporarily, as the hard budget
            constraint bites, and then plateau. Therefore, they argue
            that while governments should monitor the stock of debt to
            see how quickly enterprises are adjusting, they
            shouldn't be panicked into bailing them out.
