Interview #1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Now, you are Mr. Luxford.    What was your association with the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, Mr. Luxford?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:   Well, its organization until May of 1951, I'd say, I&#13;
&#13;
was assistant general counsel and subsequently associate general&#13;
&#13;
counsel of the Bank.     Actually for the first few days of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's organization I was the temporary US alternate executive&#13;
&#13;
director and then came into the Bank as the assistant general&#13;
&#13;
counsel.&#13;
&#13;
           Prior to that, I had been with the Treasury for the&#13;
&#13;
bulk of the time after leaving law school.     I left the Treasury&#13;
&#13;
to go into private practice in 1939, and was called back in April&#13;
&#13;
or May of 1940 on a temporary basis because I'd been working in&#13;
&#13;
the economic warfare field prior to this.     Things got worse&#13;
&#13;
rather than better, and I remained there throughout the war in&#13;
&#13;
the field of economic warfare, first as an attorney on foreign&#13;
&#13;
funds control matters, subsequently chief counsel for foreign&#13;
&#13;
funds control, then assistant general counsel, senior assistant&#13;
&#13;
general counsel of the Treasury, and assistant to the Secretary&#13;
&#13;
of the Treasury.     Most of my work through this whole period was&#13;
&#13;
monetary and international financial.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  -1-&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               At about the time that -- well, I date it very&#13;
&#13;
specifically back to a few months before the North African&#13;
&#13;
invasion -- up to that time, I had been primarily devoting my&#13;
&#13;
attention to foreign funds matters -- at that time Bernard&#13;
&#13;
Bernstein 1 , who was the assistant general counsel and under whom&#13;
&#13;
I worked as assistant, had to go into the North African&#13;
&#13;
operation, in the army, and I took over his job, which included&#13;
&#13;
all the work that was being done on postwar planning, that was&#13;
&#13;
being done in the Treasury on the international side.          And from&#13;
&#13;
that day on I was part of the small Treasury team headed by Harry&#13;
&#13;
White that was working on the programs.         Even at that time the&#13;
&#13;
plans for the Bank and Fund had been very well worked out in&#13;
&#13;
terms of writing, and we were holding from time to time meetings&#13;
&#13;
with the technical committee, the interdepartmental committee&#13;
&#13;
that had been set up under the Secretary of the Treasury as the&#13;
&#13;
chairman of a Cabinet committee.&#13;
&#13;
               On the whole, the spadework was being done in the&#13;
&#13;
Treasury, with the technical committees meeting more or less to&#13;
&#13;
comment on the proposals, and as a clearinghouse preparatory to&#13;
&#13;
the informal discussions that were going on and had been going on&#13;
&#13;
with the various countries, particularly with the British&#13;
&#13;
delegation.      That delegation, the man who was probably doing the&#13;
&#13;
most on it was Opie 2 .     I'm now addressing myself to their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
    Not E.M. Bernstein, economist, who also was a close colleague of mine&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
 Redvers Opie, son-in-law of Frank William Taussig of Harvard's&#13;
economics department&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     -2-&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Washington delegation.       At the same time Sir David Waley was&#13;
&#13;
doing some work on it.       A little bit was being done by Sir&#13;
&#13;
Frederick Phillips and Lord Brand was also familiar with what was&#13;
&#13;
going on.&#13;
&#13;
               From that point on, my time was divided equally&#13;
&#13;
between the economic warfare side and the postwar planning side.&#13;
&#13;
I had a small staff that worked with me closely on the postwar&#13;
&#13;
side.     I would say, the only man who was intimately working on it&#13;
&#13;
throughout this whole period, on the legal side beside myself,&#13;
&#13;
was Dick Brenner, now dead, who later was assistant general&#13;
&#13;
counsel of the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
               As we got down to pre-Bretton Woods, it was necessary&#13;
&#13;
to come in with drafts.       Dick Brenner and Leeman Aarons of my&#13;
&#13;
staff were the ones who had the jobs of coming through with first&#13;
&#13;
drafts.     Elting Arnold 1 may have been in on that.      I'm not sure&#13;
&#13;
whether he was at this point or not.           I could go back to the&#13;
&#13;
records and check.       But when we left for Atlantic City, we had&#13;
&#13;
drafts of both documents that embodied our approach, realizing&#13;
&#13;
that a lot of these things had to be thrashed out, but if you go&#13;
&#13;
back to those drafts you'll see how closely they were followed in&#13;
&#13;
terms of so many of the later provisions, if for no other reason&#13;
&#13;
than that we had worked through a coherent draft from which we&#13;
&#13;
were working, in terms of our negotiations and subsequent drafts.&#13;
&#13;
It's the old story -- if you get a piece of paper that has been&#13;
&#13;
developed through, you've thought through your problem, you&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
    Now general counsel, Inter-American Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     -3-&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
almost compel other people to work from it if they haven't the&#13;
&#13;
same instrument.    It's just a matter of your know what the&#13;
&#13;
implications of each other's move in the negotiations are going&#13;
&#13;
to be, in terms of having thought the whole topic through.&#13;
&#13;
            But that was a minor part of the pre-Bretton Woods&#13;
&#13;
days.    It was primarily a problem of soul-searching on the part&#13;
&#13;
of the Treasury experts, as to how you would meet the various&#13;
&#13;
problems, how you would meet the political ones.     On the one&#13;
&#13;
hand, you knew what the problems of the other countries were and&#13;
&#13;
what they were going to be asking for, and we could not keep our&#13;
&#13;
eye off the generally hostile or indifferent attitude on the part&#13;
&#13;
of the Congressional committees.    Repeatedly Secretary Morgenthau&#13;
&#13;
would go up there and report to the committees what he was doing.&#13;
&#13;
They were pretty apathetic.    They listened politely, but nobody&#13;
&#13;
gave the slightest suggestion that this was going to be easy&#13;
&#13;
going.&#13;
&#13;
            The whole problem was one of how far you could go and&#13;
&#13;
still expect to obtain Congressional approval.     At the same time,&#13;
&#13;
it became obvious to me that one of the biggest problems here was&#13;
&#13;
going to be to sell a complicated problem like the Monetary Fund&#13;
&#13;
to Congress, simply because of lack of understanding.     It's a&#13;
&#13;
highly technical field, and it would push any normal legislator's&#13;
&#13;
abilities to the nth degree, to try to understand the&#13;
&#13;
complexities of the Fund operations and the need for them.        So&#13;
&#13;
part of the job was trying to translate the complex concepts of&#13;
&#13;
the Fund, and to some extent the Bank, into terms that could be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 -4-&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
understood in the legislative body.   And obviously in doing that&#13;
&#13;
you had to simplify and then oversimplify 20 times.&#13;
&#13;
            That was equally true of mobilizing public opinion.&#13;
&#13;
We knew we wouldn't have a ghost of a chance of getting this&#13;
&#13;
through Congress unless we got strong public opinion support for&#13;
&#13;
it, particularly when we knew the bankers were very much opposed&#13;
&#13;
to it, and our program was addressed as much to educating the&#13;
&#13;
forces outside the government that could bring pressure on the&#13;
&#13;
Congress, how to push this bill through Congress.     All of this,&#13;
&#13;
bear in mind, was well before the Bretton Woods thing, but you&#13;
&#13;
started your educational campaign early, and you brought along&#13;
&#13;
with you some 50 professors of economics, for one body, that was&#13;
&#13;
working with us.   The labor unions were interested, as well as&#13;
&#13;
almost every organization that had strong political connections.&#13;
&#13;
The cotton people would be in it and the Farm Bureau people would&#13;
&#13;
be in it.   This was not a straight lobby or educational program&#13;
&#13;
at this early point so much as it was keeping them aware of what&#13;
&#13;
we were doing, what we were thinking about, at a technical level&#13;
&#13;
within their organizations, so that at a later date, when it&#13;
&#13;
became necessary really to push hard, you would have someone&#13;
&#13;
competent within each of these organizations, to begin to explain&#13;
&#13;
to their own people what it was all about.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was there rather a considerable amount of more discussion&#13;
&#13;
concerning the Fund than the Bank, due to a feeling that the Fund&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                -5-&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
was more important than the Bank or just that it was more&#13;
&#13;
complicated and needed more explaining?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:   Let me put it this way.    The Fund, as a technical&#13;
&#13;
problem, was obviously a far more challenging problem than the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.   The Fund was pretty much moving out to the periphery of&#13;
&#13;
economics, and especially in terms of international operations.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank was being formulated along more orthodox lines.        And we&#13;
&#13;
were satisfied in our own hearts that we would have no problem&#13;
&#13;
selling the Bank internationally, because this is a simple&#13;
&#13;
proposition of, here is a place to get some money, and you didn't&#13;
&#13;
have to put very much up in order to get a lot.&#13;
&#13;
           The Fund, on the other hand, represented an invasion&#13;
&#13;
of one of the (traditionally) most significant powers of&#13;
&#13;
government, in terms of the power over money, and it was in some&#13;
&#13;
respects an infringement of sovereignty in that very critical&#13;
&#13;
area.   We said it wasn't an infringement so much as an exercise&#13;
&#13;
of sovereignty, but the fact remains that, remember the British&#13;
&#13;
government fell, the Conservative Party fell, on the gold issue,&#13;
&#13;
when they went back to the 5 pound after World War II, and the&#13;
&#13;
depressing effect that had on the British economy was one of --&#13;
&#13;
well, Churchill said he would never make the mistake of tying&#13;
&#13;
Britain's hands again on the question of exchange.     Lionel&#13;
&#13;
Robbins, who sat in on these discussions, had the unfortunate&#13;
&#13;
position of having been the one who had advocated going back onto&#13;
&#13;
gold for the British government.     As a consequence, we weren't&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                -6-&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
dealing with abstractions, we were dealing with people who had&#13;
&#13;
lost power not long before in terms of insisting on stability of&#13;
&#13;
exchange rates at the sacrifice of the economy, to maintain a&#13;
&#13;
rate that was too high in terms of their capacity.     So that we&#13;
&#13;
knew our battle was going to be the Fund.     We were using the Bank&#13;
&#13;
as a device to bring them along.   That's why the Charter always&#13;
&#13;
said you couldn't belong to the Bank unless you belonged to the&#13;
&#13;
Fund.   There were other reasons, economic reasons and the like,&#13;
&#13;
but basically we wanted to force countries to agree to standards&#13;
&#13;
in the monetary field as a condition to get the benefits of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
           In the early days, as long as Keynes had his Clearing&#13;
&#13;
Union where he thought it might be accepted, he showed no&#13;
&#13;
interest at all in the Bank, and the British delegation by and&#13;
&#13;
large manifested no interest in the Bank.     And the reason was&#13;
&#13;
obvious.   You didn't need the Bank if you could write a blank&#13;
&#13;
check for all balance of payments problems.     But when the British&#13;
&#13;
finally realized that they were not going to get this, that they&#13;
&#13;
were going to have to start with limited commitments, at that&#13;
&#13;
very point Keynes reversed himself and became a very strong&#13;
&#13;
proponent of the Bank.   The logic of it was perfectly natural.&#13;
&#13;
He realized that he was not going to get an open check on the&#13;
&#13;
monetary side, that he was going to need reconstruction funds,&#13;
&#13;
and he was pushing very hard for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                -7-&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:     But the Bank and the Fund were part of a package, as far as&#13;
&#13;
the Americans were concerned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:       Absolutely.   Absolutely.      The Bank was not an&#13;
&#13;
afterthought.      It was started from the word go, the first White 1&#13;
&#13;
document, which was -- I suppose you've seen it.           It's a 100-page&#13;
&#13;
document and the first part is on the Fund, the last part is on&#13;
&#13;
the Bank, or vice versa, but they were always treated as one&#13;
&#13;
package.&#13;
&#13;
               But the complexities of the Bank were not the same as&#13;
&#13;
those of the Fund, and the big point in selling had to be the&#13;
&#13;
Fund.     What was being done structurally within the Fund, in terms&#13;
&#13;
of organization and concepts, crept into the Bank.           If you look&#13;
&#13;
at the provisions on administration and the like, you'll find&#13;
&#13;
them almost identical.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Weren't they in common -- in some of the major issues, as far&#13;
&#13;
as the Bank is concerned, for example, what were the&#13;
&#13;
anticipations with respect to the total lending capacity of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank?     And didn't you anticipate that the Bank would have to go&#13;
&#13;
to the bond market in order to get funds for lending purposes?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:      There never was the slightest doubt about that.        There&#13;
&#13;
never was the slightest doubt about that interpretation.            Keynes&#13;
&#13;
was the one who thought this guarantee device would be useful,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
    Harry Dexter White, Treasury Department&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     -8-&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and our attitude was that it certainly didn't hurt anything,&#13;
&#13;
include it.     But the whole thing was designed on the basis of&#13;
&#13;
going to the market, where you're going to the market with a&#13;
&#13;
security that, up to the amount of the United States&#13;
&#13;
subscription, was guaranteed by the United States.     And the hope&#13;
&#13;
was, and it's been borne out, that as other countries were able&#13;
&#13;
to cope with their balance of payments problems, restore their&#13;
&#13;
currencies, as international currencies, the Bank would have&#13;
&#13;
further resources in terms of strong currencies.     But it was&#13;
&#13;
designed from the word go as a Bank borrowing on a multinational&#13;
&#13;
guarantee operation, and the reason there is clear.     I mean, US&#13;
&#13;
government guarantee of a security to be sold in the market.       The&#13;
&#13;
reasons are quite apparent, if you look at United States&#13;
&#13;
corporations.     You're seeing another manifestation of it today,&#13;
&#13;
where the Kennedy Administration is trying to get off of direct&#13;
&#13;
appropriations for long-term planning, and they're having&#13;
&#13;
terrible trouble.     Treasury has been through this dozens of&#13;
&#13;
times.   Treasury knew the problems of trying to get&#13;
&#13;
appropriations.     For that reason, we set these things up from the&#13;
&#13;
word go in terms of a public debt transaction, so that we would&#13;
&#13;
create in the Bank and the Fund institutions free of the&#13;
&#13;
budgetary control of the U.S. Congress; that we would sink or&#13;
&#13;
swim in getting a sufficient capital and a technique for&#13;
&#13;
obtaining capital that would not tie us to the US Congress.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  -9-&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was it a matter of any concern that in the process of&#13;
&#13;
obtaining capital this way, the lending operations of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
would to some extent be influenced by the ability of the Bank to&#13;
&#13;
sell its bonds?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     Not a major concern, because bear in mind, the&#13;
&#13;
secretary of the Treasury at that time and the Treasury of all&#13;
&#13;
places knew what it was to sell US government bonds in a hostile&#13;
&#13;
banking community.     But the facts of life were -- and this was&#13;
&#13;
one thing we knew -- that regardless of how much the bankers&#13;
&#13;
complained, they bought the securities.     It wasn't simply because&#13;
&#13;
they loved us or because they didn't like us.     Business is&#13;
&#13;
business, and people buy government securities.     Our whole&#13;
&#13;
banking system requires it.     We finance the war with the same&#13;
&#13;
securities.     One is guaranteed, indirectly, the other is a direct&#13;
&#13;
US obligation.     We know as well as anyone in the world what the&#13;
&#13;
difference in points was between a guaranteed obligation and a&#13;
&#13;
direct obligation, but we also knew that the spread was very&#13;
&#13;
small.     There was no doubt in our minds we'd sell the securities&#13;
&#13;
whether they liked it or not.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   At least up to the amount of the United States government&#13;
&#13;
guarantee.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     And this whole device had been formulated with the view&#13;
&#13;
that it was open end.     You could always increase the amount.     It&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 10 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
would take Congressional action.     But our theory was that even&#13;
&#13;
the Bank with the resources that we were entrusting to it would&#13;
&#13;
show that it was doing a job that warranted further commitments&#13;
&#13;
on the part of the United States, in which event we would be able&#13;
&#13;
to sell it; or alternatively it would be a fiasco and nobody&#13;
&#13;
would be interested in it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How about the total lending capacity, given the original&#13;
&#13;
capital subscriptions to the Bank?        Did you feel that this would&#13;
&#13;
be adequate for handling problems of reconstruction, for example?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:   Well, bear in mind, at that time the Treasury was right&#13;
&#13;
in the heart of financing the liberated countries.        You had the&#13;
&#13;
Army, you had Lend-Lease, UNRRA was being planned by another&#13;
&#13;
group of the Treasury with State Department people right there.&#13;
&#13;
These were not regarded as single items.        You had Lend-Lease on&#13;
&#13;
the one hand.     You had UNRRA, you had Food and Agriculture --&#13;
&#13;
each one of these, if you'll note back in the first Bank drafts,&#13;
&#13;
were commodity stabilization proposals also.        But people who --&#13;
&#13;
and I've heard this many times in this Bank and elsewhere -- look&#13;
&#13;
what they regarded as the magnitude of the redevelopment problem&#13;
&#13;
in the postwar period, or reconstruction problem.        But all those&#13;
&#13;
things failed to understand the pattern.        The most shocking thing&#13;
&#13;
that happened in this country, following the death of Franklin&#13;
&#13;
Roosevelt, was the stupid announcement that we were terminating&#13;
&#13;
Lend-Lease.     It fell like a ton of bricks on everyone that had&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 11 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
been working.   We had no idea that the Bank was going to take&#13;
&#13;
over and do the job that had been done by Lend-Lease.        This was&#13;
&#13;
one of the problems of an unanticipated change in government.&#13;
&#13;
Roosevelt's death permitted people who had previously had nothing&#13;
&#13;
to do, in terms of working in this field, to move in and express&#13;
&#13;
their own particular views on an opportunistic basis.        I think&#13;
&#13;
this is one of the      Leo Crowley was one, as I recall -- who was&#13;
&#13;
in theory involved with Lend-Lease, but in fact was, I would have&#13;
&#13;
to say, more a Congressional front for it.        He permitted himself,&#13;
&#13;
because Truman was not at that point, being more of a line&#13;
&#13;
officer approach type of man, thought the man in charge of Lend-&#13;
&#13;
Lease should be the man who could advise him on this.        Crowley of&#13;
&#13;
course was being crowded all the time by Congress, "When are we&#13;
&#13;
going to cut this off?"     Well, what could be happier from his&#13;
&#13;
point of view than to say, "We're cutting it off."&#13;
&#13;
          But nobody had done the thinking in terms of what it&#13;
&#13;
meant to the rest of your program.        So it was the death of&#13;
&#13;
Roosevelt, not because it was merely the change of power and the&#13;
&#13;
change of responsibilities that resulted from that death, that&#13;
&#13;
upset all your plans.     So it's foolish to talk about the&#13;
&#13;
miscalculation in terms of the Bank and the Fund.        They were part&#13;
&#13;
of a calculation of how much can we possibly get through these&#13;
&#13;
avenues, assuming we can hold Lend-Lease for a further postwar&#13;
&#13;
period, and we have UNRRA and Food and Agriculture and&#13;
&#13;
Commodities, etc., coupled with the real miscalculation made at&#13;
&#13;
Bretton Woods and in the planning at Bretton Woods, which was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 12 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that we didn't know that we would have a cold war.        The problem&#13;
&#13;
of the rehabilitation of the war-torn areas might have been very&#13;
&#13;
substantially different, if you had had the participation and&#13;
&#13;
cooperation of the Communist-controlled areas -- in particular,&#13;
&#13;
the resources that we were having to plow into preparing&#13;
&#13;
ourselves to defend ourselves against that war were the very&#13;
&#13;
resources that could have been used to rebuild these war-torn&#13;
&#13;
areas.     But in terms of the unanticipated development, that's the&#13;
&#13;
one that I put my finger on as being the most significant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   But the Bank was only thought of as being one of a number of&#13;
&#13;
supplementary approaches to reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     That's right.   In other words, the Lend-Lease -- that's&#13;
&#13;
why the Bank was supposed to handle specific projects.        The Bank&#13;
&#13;
wasn't going to cover a blank check for the needs of a country,&#13;
&#13;
in the early days.     That was part of UNRRA's job.     It was part of&#13;
&#13;
what Lend-Lease would continue to do.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:    What the Marshall Plan eventually did do.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     Yes, it comes back to the same thing.     Sure, you were&#13;
&#13;
forced irrevocably to do it.      But we had to go through this&#13;
&#13;
hiatus that was frightening in terms of its impact on our allies&#13;
&#13;
and on the rest of the world.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  - 13 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was there any consideration as to the relative importance of&#13;
&#13;
reconstruction and development in these early discussions?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:   In this context, that obviously reconstruction had to&#13;
&#13;
come first.   Secondly, reconstruction of Western European&#13;
&#13;
productive resources was going to provide the productive capacity&#13;
&#13;
to make more valuable the relative resources of the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
and Fund, and permit them in turn to use these resources in other&#13;
&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
           Bear this in mind, too, that there was a second point&#13;
&#13;
of miscalculation, major miscalculation on the part of the people&#13;
&#13;
planning postwar planning in this period.     Their greatest concern&#13;
&#13;
was that the end of World War II would find this country and the&#13;
&#13;
rest of the world sliding back into the Depression-like economics&#13;
&#13;
of '30s.   We had only pulled ourselves out of that Depression by&#13;
&#13;
virtue of the war.   The great problem would be that of sliding&#13;
&#13;
back into the same kind of recession.   To what extent that was a&#13;
&#13;
miscalculation in economics and to what extent it was a corollary&#13;
&#13;
of miscalculating the position of Russia -- in other words, we&#13;
&#13;
have continued on a wartime economy, in terms of the amount of&#13;
&#13;
our production that's going into "defense."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you imply by this that the Bank was thought of&#13;
&#13;
substantially as a counter-cyclical lending organization as&#13;
&#13;
distinct from a long-term development organization?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 14 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     No, but the forces -- if the Bank would be healthy and&#13;
&#13;
would be desired, it would be in a position to go back to&#13;
&#13;
Congress for more money, because if you were in a period in which&#13;
&#13;
we were having trouble to maintain employment abroad, you would&#13;
&#13;
have a further reason for saying, "Look, let's make some sound&#13;
&#13;
loans here through the Bank, and get something in return for our&#13;
&#13;
money."     It's the same thing as the pattern of RFC.   RFC never&#13;
&#13;
had any trouble in Congress in getting money.      Whereas if you&#13;
&#13;
said "We're going to have a WPA program or a relief program," you&#13;
&#13;
had all kinds of hostility.      This was again a continuation --&#13;
&#13;
concrete solid projects in which we have not just the United&#13;
&#13;
States backing but the rest of the world.      So they tie together.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:    I wonder if you'd comment on the anticipation with respect to&#13;
&#13;
the organization of the Bank, particularly the relationship&#13;
&#13;
between managers and the executive director.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     You have to discuss this question historically in terms&#13;
&#13;
of tactics (?).      Once the British made up their mind that they&#13;
&#13;
couldn't have the Clearing Union 1 approach, their great concern&#13;
&#13;
was addressed to management of the Fund, and their concept of&#13;
&#13;
Fund management was designed to make drawings at the Fund&#13;
&#13;
automatic or as automatic as they could be.      The United States,&#13;
&#13;
on the other hand, for the same reasons that it opposed the&#13;
&#13;
Clearing Union was opposed to permitting countries to draw their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
    i.e., "Keynes Plan"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  - 15 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
full quota, with perhaps no restrictions or virtually no&#13;
&#13;
restrictions.     In that, we well realize that in every balance of&#13;
&#13;
payments problem there are two solutions to it, one of them&#13;
&#13;
requiring the country itself to apply pressures within its&#13;
&#13;
economy, and the other of obtaining aid from abroad to adjust&#13;
&#13;
that balance of payments problem.         We saw the Fund as a means of&#13;
&#13;
giving the country the time to take corrective actions without&#13;
&#13;
having to take desperate actions, but we saw no reason for&#13;
&#13;
financing balance of payments deficits, without evidence that the&#13;
&#13;
country was taking steps, and this was the concept that prompted&#13;
&#13;
the United States delegation to insist on strong management.         The&#13;
&#13;
ultimate --&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   -- when you say strong management here, you mean management&#13;
&#13;
by the representatives of the countries?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:   A combination of management, in terms of administrative&#13;
&#13;
management, plus the board -- in other words, that was&#13;
&#13;
management.     The ultimate fight on this was the showdown at&#13;
&#13;
Savannah in terms of whether you would have full-time or part-&#13;
&#13;
time executive directors.     But it was part and parcel of forcing&#13;
&#13;
the administration of the Fund into the hands of people that were&#13;
&#13;
full-time experts, or were fully cognizant in advance of what was&#13;
&#13;
going on around the world.     One thing that we were always fearful&#13;
&#13;
of was that we would be confronted with a fait accompli, that&#13;
&#13;
some day a country would come and say "Look, we need so much&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 16 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
money because we're out."     White said that always to Keynes in&#13;
&#13;
private -- "Look, if you've got a staff that will study these&#13;
&#13;
problems, it's impossible for any country to find itself by&#13;
&#13;
surprise in balance of payments troubles.        It doesn't happen that&#13;
&#13;
way.     That's why we want a good strong staff, that's why we want&#13;
&#13;
that staff reporting to people who can act for their governments&#13;
&#13;
in terms of having all the facts."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Still, you wanted the governments through their executive&#13;
&#13;
directors to be the final --&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     -- they had to be.   These were not technical decisions,&#13;
&#13;
they were very high policy decisions, but we wanted the directors&#13;
&#13;
of the Fund to be in a position to talk intelligently to their&#13;
&#13;
own countries and point out the facts of life, because through&#13;
&#13;
the countries that were going to vote on this, or the key&#13;
&#13;
countries that were going to vote on this, might be willing to&#13;
&#13;
say "We'll act on this basis," but we wanted them to be fully&#13;
&#13;
informed and be responsible people.        White's feeling was that we&#13;
&#13;
had to get away from voting on these purely as political matters.&#13;
&#13;
They had to be in terms of what is sound for the country, on the&#13;
&#13;
one hand, and the Fund and the other countries on the other.        But&#13;
&#13;
this is why the fight at Bretton Woods on this was one of the&#13;
&#13;
biggest fights at Bretton Woods.      When it started there it was on&#13;
&#13;
management, and one of our big fights was in terms of getting&#13;
&#13;
weighed voting.     But surprisingly enough that did not produce as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  - 17 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
much opposition as we'd expected.         But the battles in Commission&#13;
&#13;
3 on the Fund at Bretton Woods were bloody battles of politics,&#13;
&#13;
in terms of power politics.     I don't say that in a critical way.&#13;
&#13;
This is where they were fighting for their lifeblood, in terms of&#13;
&#13;
who was going to control the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
             These same concepts carried over to the Bank, but not&#13;
&#13;
with the same degree of self-analysis or independent analysis.&#13;
&#13;
It was more that here was a starting point, let the burden of&#13;
&#13;
proof be on someone else who wishes to justify the distinction in&#13;
&#13;
terms of the management of the two institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:     I wonder if we might talk about the time period when the Bank&#13;
&#13;
was actually getting under way, in other words, the period&#13;
&#13;
immediately after the Savannah Conference.         I understand it had&#13;
&#13;
been generally agreed that the United States government would&#13;
&#13;
find a president for the Bank.     Was this so, and how did it work&#13;
&#13;
out?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     In the planning for the Fund -- I start there again&#13;
&#13;
because the Bank and Fund managements are functions of each other&#13;
&#13;
-- in the planning of the Fund, there were -- there was a strong&#13;
&#13;
group in the United States that had always thought Harry White&#13;
&#13;
would make an excellent managing director for the Fund.         There&#13;
&#13;
was an equally strong group who hated his guts and would have&#13;
&#13;
done anything they could to have prevented it.         I may say this,&#13;
&#13;
that on the whole White was one of the most popular men at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 18 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bretton Woods.     I'm not addressing myself necessarily to the&#13;
&#13;
British delegation or to some of the Western European&#13;
&#13;
delegations.     I think they highly respected him.     But in terms of&#13;
&#13;
Latin America and elsewhere, so many countries having dealt with&#13;
&#13;
the man for years in various problems, had confidence that here&#13;
&#13;
is the man who will understand our problem and who, if he sees&#13;
&#13;
our problem, will fight, and he's not afraid to fight.        They were&#13;
&#13;
afraid that they would be submerged by an administration by&#13;
&#13;
people who had no real knowledge or any real sympathy for their&#13;
&#13;
problems.     So again the death of Roosevelt created problems, in&#13;
&#13;
that you had a complete switchover in the executive branch of the&#13;
&#13;
government, as witness the fact that by the time we got to the&#13;
&#13;
British loan and to Savannah, and Savannah was immediately&#13;
&#13;
following the British loan negotiations, Frederick Moore Vinson&#13;
&#13;
was the Secretary of the Treasury.        Vinson was at Bretton Woods,&#13;
&#13;
and Vinson, Bernstein, Harry White and I used to sit in our room&#13;
&#13;
(Bernstein's and my room, we had a large room up there) and&#13;
&#13;
discuss all phases of the problems that were going on at Bretton&#13;
&#13;
Woods, postwar, and we really used that as a period of educating&#13;
&#13;
Vinson.     Nobody could see that he was the man that was coming in&#13;
&#13;
as Secretary of the Treasury, but he liked to drink bourbon, we&#13;
&#13;
liked to drink bourbon, and this would start at 1 or 2 in the&#13;
&#13;
morning when we got through work and go through to the wee hours&#13;
&#13;
of the night.     We spent that time educating that man on the&#13;
&#13;
problems of world economics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 19 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   This was before Savannah that you're talking about?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     I'm talking about Bretton Woods, where Vinson first got&#13;
&#13;
his indoctrination into the problems.         He was pulled in there for&#13;
&#13;
political reasons, to begin with.         He always had warm relations&#13;
&#13;
on the Hill.     Morgenthau was delighted to have him, because he&#13;
&#13;
knew he could work with Vinson.     What we did was to educate&#13;
&#13;
Vinson.     We took the opportunity, and I know he was anxious for&#13;
&#13;
the opportunity to really learn something about the problems.&#13;
&#13;
But he'd always -- Keynes and he never saw eye to eye, in terms&#13;
&#13;
of personality clash.     You know Keynes was a highly controversial&#13;
&#13;
figure then, and any Congressman who could yap at Keynes took the&#13;
&#13;
occasion to do it, and this gave Vinson the opportunity to show&#13;
&#13;
that he wasn't going to be sucked in by Keynes.         It was a chip on&#13;
&#13;
the shoulder attitude.&#13;
&#13;
             Well, I say all of this because when Vinson became&#13;
&#13;
Secretary of the Treasury, he had the highest respect for Harry&#13;
&#13;
White, but he never had the personal relationship or friendship&#13;
&#13;
for White that perhaps he'd had for Eddie Bernstein and me.         He&#13;
&#13;
would come talk to us about problems, and talk with Harry about&#13;
&#13;
it, but you had a feeling that perhaps Bernstein and I had the&#13;
&#13;
confidence of Vinson to a greater extent than White.&#13;
&#13;
             Vinson also at this time -- incidentally, this is&#13;
&#13;
Edward Bernstein -- Vinson at this time also was beginning to get&#13;
&#13;
the indoctrination by the banking community in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
bonds.     How are we going to sell these bonds?      And mind you, this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 20 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
happens to every Secretary of the Treasury when he comes into&#13;
&#13;
office -- how are you going to sell these bonds?    We were still&#13;
&#13;
going through the war loans and he was having his problems.     He&#13;
&#13;
was viewing the problem of selling the Bank's bonds in the light&#13;
&#13;
of what he was learning with regard to selling US government&#13;
&#13;
bonds, which was all a new experience to him.   Dan Bell was&#13;
&#13;
really operating it as Under Secretary, but obviously he would&#13;
&#13;
discuss these problems, and the bankers would come down before&#13;
&#13;
every big issue of US government bonds and they'd discuss the&#13;
&#13;
terms and the like, and it was a very interesting operation to a&#13;
&#13;
spectator in terms of what they'll tell you that you can do and&#13;
&#13;
can't do and so forth and so on.&#13;
&#13;
           So he was being indoctrinated, we have got to have a&#13;
&#13;
US president for the Bank.   Mind you, there was never any&#13;
&#13;
difficulty about that.   We'd all agreed there should be a US&#13;
&#13;
president for the Bank, the only question was who he should be.&#13;
&#13;
And he was also having discussions with others, because if there&#13;
&#13;
was one man that was hated, well hated, it was Harry White, and&#13;
&#13;
Vinson didn't like to run a shop in which he was having to&#13;
&#13;
constantly carry the battle for a fighter like White.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   He was hated in the banking community?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:   Oh, White was hated in the banking community as perhaps&#13;
&#13;
no other man in the United States has been hated.    He was equally&#13;
&#13;
hated by people within the departments of every part of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 21 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
executive branch of the government who had to deal with him -- I&#13;
&#13;
say, by some people; he was loved by others.     I have seen&#13;
&#13;
occasions on which White upset the position of a Cabinet officer&#13;
&#13;
like nobody's business, and they remembered it.     He would do it&#13;
&#13;
in various ways.    He would do it either by crucifying them in an&#13;
&#13;
open discussion, with other people watching, or alternatively by&#13;
&#13;
calling one of his trusted friends in that department and saying,&#13;
&#13;
"Hey, set this guy straight."&#13;
&#13;
            No, he was a very strong personality.   He was hated by&#13;
&#13;
many as well as loved by a few.     Perhaps that's an easier way to&#13;
&#13;
describe it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   The point was, Vinson was aware of this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:    Oh, my, yes.   He had high respect for Harry White, but&#13;
&#13;
he could naturally have reservations as to whether or not he&#13;
&#13;
wanted to ride this along.     And he had the further reason --&#13;
&#13;
everyone would concede the Bank should be run by a US president,&#13;
&#13;
the only question was whether or not that precluded a US national&#13;
&#13;
from being the head of the Fund.     He soon sensed that Vinson was&#13;
&#13;
going to come out saying we can't have both.     At Savannah, this&#13;
&#13;
came as a shock to a number of delegations that White was not&#13;
&#13;
going to be the head, because they would have been happy to have&#13;
&#13;
him as head of the Fund and forget what was going to happen to&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.    This was a thing that came to me repeatedly and came&#13;
&#13;
to Ed Bernstein because they knew we were close to Vinson.        I can&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 22 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
recall that Ed Bernstein and I spent two evenings down there, the&#13;
&#13;
whole evenings, just going hammer and tong at Vinson on this one&#13;
&#13;
score, that it was going to take a strong man like White to be&#13;
&#13;
able to make something out of the Fund during the critical period&#13;
&#13;
that we were going into.     And he said no, it wasn't going to be,&#13;
&#13;
willy-nilly.&#13;
&#13;
           I do know this, that even Keynes spoke to Vinson and&#13;
&#13;
told him that they would prefer White to be the head of the Fund,&#13;
&#13;
and they would do that and still concede the United States the&#13;
&#13;
presidency of the Bank.    Keynes having seen this, became one of&#13;
&#13;
White's greatest supporters.     In other words, he then saw that&#13;
&#13;
White politically would be a far greater protection to the&#13;
&#13;
British and European interests than would a man of Vinson's&#13;
&#13;
mentality as Secretary of the Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   When did Vinson became Secretary of the Treasury?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:   Two or three days before Potsdam.    He was supposed to&#13;
&#13;
go to Potsdam with Truman.     Morgenthau was upset because he&#13;
&#13;
thought he wasn't getting the support he should get out of Truman&#13;
&#13;
on the German program, and he went over and had a showdown, and&#13;
&#13;
he ended up resigning right then and there.     So Vinson didn't get&#13;
&#13;
to go to Potsdam.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So he'd been Secretary of the Treasury for seven or eight&#13;
&#13;
months before Savannah.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 23 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:   Well, you can check the dates. I wouldn't want to say.&#13;
&#13;
           Well, all of this means that there was this kind of&#13;
&#13;
interregnum occurring between transitions of administrations, and&#13;
&#13;
personalities involved, that made it -- well, left no question&#13;
&#13;
whatever but what the head of the Bank would be an American.     The&#13;
&#13;
only question that remained was who that American was going to&#13;
&#13;
be, and Vinson had a very major voice in that decision.&#13;
&#13;
           I would again recall that I had long and very serious&#13;
&#13;
meetings with Vinson on the question of whether or not he was&#13;
&#13;
going to name someone from Wall Street to be head of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
He was having great pressure put on him in particular for Lew&#13;
&#13;
Douglas, and I did not -- there were a number of others thought&#13;
&#13;
that would be a tragedy, were the Bank to go in under the&#13;
&#13;
auspices of "Wall Street bankers," and the weapon that was being&#13;
&#13;
used was that if you don't you won't be able to sell your bonds.&#13;
&#13;
Whereas what we were most alarmed about was, you'd start with&#13;
&#13;
people who were hostile to the whole concept of the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
Fund.   We had fought these people for years.    They had bitterly&#13;
&#13;
opposed, in the early days, both the Bank and the Fund, and as&#13;
&#13;
far as I'm concerned, it was a tactical maneuver to accept the&#13;
&#13;
Bank and oppose the Fund.     It wasn't that they had any real love&#13;
&#13;
for either.   It was that this was a tactical device so they&#13;
&#13;
wouldn't appear to be negative across the board.     But they saw or&#13;
&#13;
thought they saw where they might make a fight and control the&#13;
&#13;
management of the Bank, they knew damn well they'd never get the&#13;
&#13;
management of the Fund.     I'm not addressing myself in saying that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 24 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
to Douglas having this point of view.       I wouldn't know what&#13;
&#13;
Douglas's point of view was.       All I know is that the people who&#13;
&#13;
were pushing for Douglas were the group who challenged the&#13;
&#13;
fundamentals of the Bank and Fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Douglas was at that time in what position?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:       President of not Equitable, was it Mutual of New York?&#13;
&#13;
One of the large insurance companies.       Then you can see, we ended&#13;
&#13;
up with Eugene Meyer.       And we were all very happy.   He was the&#13;
&#13;
second choice, so to speak, after Douglas.       I won't say he was&#13;
&#13;
the second choice, I'd say he was the compromise, and I'll be&#13;
&#13;
very candid with you, nobody consulted me about these things,&#13;
&#13;
although I would be shouting my head off about it.        Vinson was&#13;
&#13;
the greatest guy in the world to listen and listen very carefully&#13;
&#13;
and argue with you, but never once tipping his hand as to what he&#13;
&#13;
was going to do.      Actually this is what the British hated in the&#13;
&#13;
British loan negotiations.       He listened and listened and&#13;
&#13;
listened, but he was a wonderful poker player, he'd never say&#13;
&#13;
anything, and that was true of the way he handled NAC 1 .       He had&#13;
&#13;
everybody there saying how much will go to the British, but never&#13;
&#13;
once did he pick the figure until the last minute.&#13;
&#13;
               Well, I think this, that Vinson was making a happy&#13;
&#13;
choice, that the market, to the extent that that was a problem,&#13;
&#13;
would not regard Eugene Meyer as a wild-eyed liberal.        On the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
    National Advisory Council&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   - 25 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
other hand, those people that knew Meyer and more particularly&#13;
&#13;
knew what he was doing in the Washington Post had confidence that&#13;
&#13;
that type of man was the kind of a man that could do a good job.&#13;
&#13;
             We had a very vivid example of this when Ned Brown was&#13;
&#13;
named to the US delegation going to Bretton Woods.         He was&#13;
&#13;
president and chairman of the board of First National of Chicago.&#13;
&#13;
I know Bernstein said, "For God's sake, we're bringing a banker&#13;
&#13;
right into this thing when they're all opposed to it."&#13;
&#13;
             Morgenthau said, "No, I've dealt with Brown a long&#13;
&#13;
while.     He's got great integrity.      If Brown goes to Bretton Woods&#13;
&#13;
he'll go there because he believes in it.         He won't go and in any&#13;
&#13;
sense take advantage of his position to hurt us later."&#13;
&#13;
             Well, the next day up comes Brown.      And it was Eddie's&#13;
&#13;
job and my job to educate him, because he said, "I'm not going up&#13;
&#13;
there unless I'm satisfied this is a good deal."         Well, Brown&#13;
&#13;
spent the better part of two weeks day and night with us, and we&#13;
&#13;
just went hammer and tongs at this proposition, why you needed&#13;
&#13;
the Bank and the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   You're talking about the Bretton Woods conference.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     That's right, to give you an example of where you have&#13;
&#13;
a man of that caliber -- at Bretton Woods we could not have had a&#13;
&#13;
better supporter, and he knew about these provisions and&#13;
&#13;
articles.     He was a lawyer in addition to everything else.       He&#13;
&#13;
knew that he could answer, and it made the best thing in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 26 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
world.     When Ned Brown, whom people realized was sympathetic to&#13;
&#13;
this, said, "You can't do this," it wasn't a wild-eyed New Dealer&#13;
&#13;
saying it, it was somebody who spoke with real authority and the&#13;
&#13;
Europeans would listen to him.&#13;
&#13;
             So, too, we had the same kind of feeling that given a&#13;
&#13;
man with that open-mindedness and integrity, we would not have&#13;
&#13;
any trouble with him in terms of management.       And it was in that&#13;
&#13;
context that we would welcome a man like Eugene Meyer.       Here was&#13;
&#13;
a man that by his whole record indicated a willingness to re-&#13;
&#13;
examine things.      His own paper had shifted from a pretty stogy&#13;
&#13;
Republican paper down to not a Democratic paper but a first-class&#13;
&#13;
liberal paper, in terms of being willing to judge every issue on&#13;
&#13;
its merits, and he had taken a forward position in the&#13;
&#13;
international field early in the game.&#13;
&#13;
             So that's about how we got that done.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was there any consideration that Harry White be president of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     No.   Not under the Vinson regime.   Incidentally, there&#13;
&#13;
were rumors that -- while we were down at Savannah, there were&#13;
&#13;
rumors that Harry White's nomination was being held up because of&#13;
&#13;
either some remarks -- well, Winchell had broadcast over the&#13;
&#13;
radio during the Savannah conference that his nomination was&#13;
&#13;
being held up at the White House because of his tie with one of&#13;
&#13;
these Red operations.      I think it was the one coming out of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  - 27 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Canada.     Finally down at Savannah Eddie and I just asked Vinson,&#13;
&#13;
"Is this the reason you're doing this?         It would make sense.&#13;
&#13;
We're not fussing about it if that's the basis of it, but for&#13;
&#13;
God's sake let's come down and deal with these things on their&#13;
&#13;
merits."&#13;
&#13;
             He said, "That hasn't a thing to do with it.      Don't&#13;
&#13;
worry about that.      That just isn't in the picture."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did Vinson himself interfere at all in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     Yes.   Perhaps it was part of, I hate to say deviousness&#13;
&#13;
on my part, but I was not the least bit troubled about fighting&#13;
&#13;
New York by getting Vinson interested in taking the presidency of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.     I say that for the same reason that I have described&#13;
&#13;
what we did with Brown in terms of developing enthusiasm in the&#13;
&#13;
man, seeing that he understood the situation.         Brown would have&#13;
&#13;
been an ideal man.      We couldn't get him.     We couldn't even get&#13;
&#13;
him as a good candidate for the position.         On the same basis, we&#13;
&#13;
had this same go-round with Vinson at Bretton Woods.         He'd had&#13;
&#13;
the benefit of working on these things at Savannah, and prior to&#13;
&#13;
that in terms that half of his work was in the international&#13;
&#13;
economic side.      He was getting a real indoctrination, and I've&#13;
&#13;
always said that Vinson, while he had the cold fish attitude on&#13;
&#13;
the British loan, was making the most cautious appraisal of how&#13;
&#13;
much he could get for the British through Congress, and but for&#13;
&#13;
Vinson that British loan would never have got through Congress.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  - 28 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It's easy enough for everyone to say the loan should have been&#13;
&#13;
twice that amount.     It's the guy that gets it through Congress&#13;
&#13;
that perhaps has reasons for what he did, and Vinson did a&#13;
&#13;
magnificent job on that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   But what about Vinson's interest in the presidency of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     Vinson was in this position in his career.   He had come&#13;
&#13;
into the Secretary of the Treasuryship rather fortuitously.         He&#13;
&#13;
had left the Court of Appeals bench at Roosevelt's request early&#13;
&#13;
in the war to do special work for Roosevelt.      I don't think he&#13;
&#13;
regarded the Treasuryship as his dish of tea over any period of&#13;
&#13;
time.     I talked with him about this after a speech one night.         He&#13;
&#13;
was a good personal friend of Jimmie Byrnes, cronies, as with&#13;
&#13;
Truman.     The three of them were cronies.   But it was apparent&#13;
&#13;
even then that Byrnes's days were limited, that Byrnes was too&#13;
&#13;
high-handed in his attitude toward Truman.      Vinson had discussed&#13;
&#13;
with me on two or three occasions going back and running for the&#13;
&#13;
Senate in Kentucky.      He always loved politics.   And I said, "Why&#13;
&#13;
start there?"&#13;
&#13;
             He said, "Look, with the caliber of the Senate we've&#13;
&#13;
got, junior Senator means nothing, if he's a good man.      You go to&#13;
&#13;
the top in a hurry.     I just like that kind of work."&#13;
&#13;
             But the trouble back then was, the judge just did not&#13;
&#13;
have the income.     He had no real resources except those that he&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 29 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
could draw from his salary, and it's very hard for a Cabinet&#13;
&#13;
officer or a man going places in the top echelons of the&#13;
&#13;
government to go too far without some other means of support.         I&#13;
&#13;
remember he told me early in the game, he said, "Get out and get&#13;
&#13;
into private practice so you can get some financing to go ahead&#13;
&#13;
and move on the political side.   But you'll never do it the other&#13;
&#13;
way."&#13;
&#13;
          Well, this is what he was saying -- "I'd like to&#13;
&#13;
become Senator, I can't do it, can't afford it.   I don't know&#13;
&#13;
what I'm going to do."&#13;
&#13;
          The job he had as Secretary of the Treasury I think he&#13;
&#13;
regarded as transitory.   He was being sounded out then for&#13;
&#13;
Secretary of State when Jimmie Byrnes was to leave, and he asked&#13;
&#13;
me -- he didn't want me to come over to the World Bank or the&#13;
&#13;
Fund, he wanted me to stay there with him, and I told him I&#13;
&#13;
couldn't afford it.   He said, "I'll make you Assistant&#13;
&#13;
Secretary."&#13;
&#13;
          "That only makes it worse, then I have to do the&#13;
&#13;
entertaining and I haven't got the income for it."&#13;
&#13;
          He said, "Well, is there any job in the government&#13;
&#13;
that would keep you here in the government?"&#13;
&#13;
          I said, "Yes, if you go to State as Secretary I'll go&#13;
&#13;
over there as Assistant Secretary in charge of Administration."&#13;
&#13;
          He was a little surprised, but that was because I had&#13;
&#13;
some particular ideas on State Department and personnel.      But I&#13;
&#13;
tried to show him where, given his position, he would be a lot&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 30 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
better off as president of the World Bank than he would living&#13;
&#13;
hand to mouth as either Secretary of State or of Treasury.     It&#13;
&#13;
was the same kind of decision I was being forced to make myself,&#13;
&#13;
on a much lesser scale.    It wasn't that I didn't like the work in&#13;
&#13;
Treasury or wouldn't like the work in government, it was just&#13;
&#13;
getting damned hard to live, in terms of responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
           So I've always had a feeling that, again it was a&#13;
&#13;
fortuitous matter of Stone dying and Vinson probably even then&#13;
&#13;
discussing with the President the possibility of him becoming&#13;
&#13;
president of the Bank, when he becomes Chief Justice.    Again, I&#13;
&#13;
can see where Truman was saying, "This is the way we give you at&#13;
&#13;
least a little more income and certainly the prestige to which&#13;
&#13;
you're entitled, and a lifetime tenure."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was it -- Vinson or Byrnes, or the two together that finally&#13;
&#13;
selected Mr. Meyer?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:   I don't know.   I have guesses and opinions on this.     My&#13;
&#13;
opinion is that they talked together, worked very closely&#13;
&#13;
together on these things, but that in the field of the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
the Fund, primary responsibility was in the Treasury, in the&#13;
&#13;
sense that we had succeeded in getting the Secretary of the&#13;
&#13;
Treasury named as the head of the National Advisory Council where&#13;
&#13;
Acheson was breaking his neck to get that for State.    You had&#13;
&#13;
established a pattern in which primary responsibility in the&#13;
&#13;
international financial and economic field was in Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 31 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Vinson had the attitude that he was not out searching for&#13;
&#13;
authority, but he was very jealous of his prerogatives within his&#13;
&#13;
jurisdiction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              - 32 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interview 2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:    To pick up the thread of the conversation on the last&#13;
&#13;
tape, I'm certain that Byrnes and Vinson were working as a team&#13;
&#13;
in terms of selection.     I wouldn't have any way of knowing which&#13;
&#13;
of them had picked the name Meyer or whether either of them had,&#13;
&#13;
but knowing Vinson, I know that he would have a very strong&#13;
&#13;
position in terms of the selection of that character.&#13;
&#13;
            You mentioned the problem of why the executive&#13;
&#13;
directorships were divided in the way that they were, in terms of&#13;
&#13;
State and Treasury.     I think this is part of the horse trading&#13;
&#13;
that both Vinson and Byrnes were experts at.      They saw that there&#13;
&#13;
was a role for both in the international economics field.       There&#13;
&#13;
was never any suggestion that Treasury was trying to make its own&#13;
&#13;
foreign policy.     It was a question of what the relationships&#13;
&#13;
between the two should be in this field.      And the happy&#13;
&#13;
compromise was that the Fund being primarily a problem with&#13;
&#13;
highly technical characteristics, and requiring the most intimate&#13;
&#13;
knowledge of the financial and fiscal policies of the United&#13;
&#13;
States, it was best that the United States executive director for&#13;
&#13;
the Fund should be the prerogative of the Secretary of the&#13;
&#13;
Treasury.     Similarly that left the Bank for State Department, but&#13;
&#13;
bear in mind that Collado 1 was a choice that Treasury would have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
  Pete Collado (Emilio Gabriel Collado) - State Department Economic&#13;
Expert; first U.S. Director to World Bank; fired as part of Jack McCloy&#13;
deal as president of World Bank; now Treasurer &amp; Director, Standard of&#13;
Jersey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 33 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
had no difficulty at all in accepting.      They'd have been&#13;
&#13;
delighted to have a man like Collado.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   He had in fact been in the Treasury in his earlier years, had&#13;
&#13;
he not?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     That's right.   I can tell you this, that before the&#13;
&#13;
death of Roosevelt, White expected to be -- I'm sure with a real&#13;
&#13;
basis for it -- to be the head of the Fund, and he wanted me to&#13;
&#13;
become US executive director of the Fund, and he talked to me&#13;
&#13;
several times about it, and I had been a little bit reluctant.         I&#13;
&#13;
said, "That's nice, Harry, but you aren't really in a position to&#13;
&#13;
offer it."&#13;
&#13;
             He said, "Well, let's think in these terms.   You're in&#13;
&#13;
a position to ask for it or to get it."&#13;
&#13;
             I was troubled about it, and I went one day to see&#13;
&#13;
Colonel (Bernard) Bernstein who was a good friend of White's as&#13;
&#13;
well as mine, and had been my boss in the Treasury before he went&#13;
&#13;
into the Army.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   This is Bernard Bernstein?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     Bernard Bernstein.   He knew us both well, and I went to&#13;
&#13;
see him.     He had an office down in the Tower Building, part time,&#13;
&#13;
for his New York office, and I went over and spent a couple of&#13;
&#13;
hours with him discussing this very problem.      I said, "White and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  - 34 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I get along very well working as a team where we are equals, but&#13;
&#13;
I could never work under Harry White.      And I'm a little bit&#13;
&#13;
worried that his concept of him being the head of the Fund and me&#13;
&#13;
being the US executive director would be that I would be under an&#13;
&#13;
obligation to support White on positions where I didn't happen to&#13;
&#13;
agree with him."&#13;
&#13;
            It was a soul-searching proposition -- the idea of&#13;
&#13;
being executive director of the Fund would have been attractive.&#13;
&#13;
I liked the field.   I liked the people.     But I was sorely&#13;
&#13;
troubled about working in a relationship with White in which he&#13;
&#13;
would think that he was speaking for the United States, when in&#13;
&#13;
fact I would be speaking for the United States.      Fortunately, in&#13;
&#13;
this context at least, I never had to resolve that question.&#13;
&#13;
            But to get back, you will note too that the State&#13;
&#13;
Department was always the vice governor of the US delegation, and&#13;
&#13;
this was just a working relationship that evolved, and its good&#13;
&#13;
sense is recognized by the fact that that's very largely what&#13;
&#13;
Treasury and State have done ever since.      There was never any&#13;
&#13;
signed agreement anyone could balk at, but it is a practical way&#13;
&#13;
of dealing with a touchy problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Now I wonder if you could tell us something about what was&#13;
&#13;
happening in the Bank after Savannah, when the Bank was really&#13;
&#13;
getting organized?   You came to the Bank immediately after&#13;
&#13;
Savannah?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 35 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:      I came as temporary alternate executive director of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.     Vinson asked me what job I wanted in the Bank and the&#13;
&#13;
Fund.     I told him that I would prefer to be general counsel of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank, in terms of my long-range interests.        I thought that&#13;
&#13;
the role of the lawyer in the Bank would be more attractive, and&#13;
&#13;
secondly I knew that E. M. Bernstein wanted to be research&#13;
&#13;
director of the Fund.       I knew White was going to be executive&#13;
&#13;
director, and I had a feeling that it was wrong for Treasury to&#13;
&#13;
commit all of its top staff to one institution and not to the&#13;
&#13;
other.     The trouble was that there was no president of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
at this early day to carry on discussions of who was going to get&#13;
&#13;
these positions.      Gutt 1 immediately asked me to be general&#13;
&#13;
counsel of the Fund, and I told him that under the circumstances&#13;
&#13;
I was honored but that I preferred to go with the Bank.        Also&#13;
&#13;
this would make it possible for Brenner to take the assistant&#13;
&#13;
general counselship of the Fund, for it would have been very&#13;
&#13;
difficult to have had two of us in those positions.&#13;
&#13;
               Well, when I get around to the appointment of Meyer,&#13;
&#13;
it became obvious that Meyer had other things on his mind, and&#13;
&#13;
Vinson said, "Well, go see Meyer," so I went to see him.          He&#13;
&#13;
said, "Look, I want you on the staff.        I want you as assistant&#13;
&#13;
general counsel.      I don't want you as general counsel, you're too&#13;
&#13;
young -- I think I would have trouble in terms of pulling other&#13;
&#13;
men in if I had to pull in men older than you in pulling a staff&#13;
&#13;
together.      Play along with me, and I assure you that you won't&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
    First Managing Director of the Fund, Belgian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    - 36 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
lose by it.   More than that, I assure you you'll get the same pay&#13;
&#13;
that you would have as general counsel of the Fund."&#13;
&#13;
           I didn't like it.   At the same time, I had a great&#13;
&#13;
deal of confidence in Meyer.   I was satisfied that he was not&#13;
&#13;
being pushed into this position, and I decided myself, rather&#13;
&#13;
than to resort to pressure, I would rather go in and work with&#13;
&#13;
Meyer on his terms than to have him feel that I was forced down&#13;
&#13;
his throat, so that's the deal we made.   I went over as assistant&#13;
&#13;
general counsel, and, oh, I guess it was maybe ten days later,&#13;
&#13;
Chester McLain came in as general counsel.   I had never met him&#13;
&#13;
until he came in.&#13;
&#13;
           The early days of the board, Pete Collado was acting&#13;
&#13;
as chairman of the board in the absence of a president.    The&#13;
&#13;
meetings were, by and large, a continuation of the friendly&#13;
&#13;
spirit that had developed at Bretton Woods and Savannah.    There&#13;
&#13;
was a little byplay going on in terms of this or that, but bear&#13;
&#13;
in mind, without a chief executive officer, there was very little&#13;
&#13;
that could be done in the way of actual operations.&#13;
&#13;
           I think one of the first things that was done before&#13;
&#13;
Meyer took office was of course calling in our first capital&#13;
&#13;
money.   There were minor discussions with regard to -- none of&#13;
&#13;
particular substance.   So I think that about covers as much as I&#13;
&#13;
can give you, in terms of policy deliberations prior to Meyer&#13;
&#13;
taking office -- housekeeping duties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 37 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What were some of the issues that arose after Meyer became&#13;
&#13;
president?     Did the question of a bond issue begin to be&#13;
&#13;
discussed?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     This I think you would do better to get from Hooker 1&#13;
&#13;
and from Collado, because you must bear in mind, as assistant&#13;
&#13;
general counsel I did not sit in on board meetings.        I knew in&#13;
&#13;
general what was going on, but in terms of firsthand witness to&#13;
&#13;
these matters you'd be better off to get them, on what was said&#13;
&#13;
in board meetings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did the staff begin to explore policy questions and prepare&#13;
&#13;
papers on lending policy, borrowing policy, and so on?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     Again I can't speak for the staff.     Speaking for&#13;
&#13;
myself, no.     My own opinion of what was happening was that McLain&#13;
&#13;
had a very special relationship with Meyer, and obviously -- I&#13;
&#13;
say obviously -- it was McLain who was carrying on these&#13;
&#13;
discussions with Meyer.     Whether and to what extent others were&#13;
&#13;
consulted, it's hard for me to know.        You could sense that Meyer&#13;
&#13;
was confronted with a strong board, being led by Collado, but&#13;
&#13;
Collado had the moral backing of a number of the directors, but&#13;
&#13;
not official backing, in the sense that governments weren't going&#13;
&#13;
to come to blows over these issues.        But as far as the moral&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
  Hooker, ex-State Department; Collado Assistant Executive Director&#13;
following me&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  - 38 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
support, you would sense it in talking to various directors of&#13;
&#13;
the board.     The board was not going to take laying down that the&#13;
&#13;
executive was going to do the operating and call them in to&#13;
&#13;
approve it.     You'll hear rumors, but I don't think you should&#13;
&#13;
fill your record with rumors and secondhand information when&#13;
&#13;
firsthand information is available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Were there any loan applications outstanding by say the fall&#13;
&#13;
of    ?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     Yes.   I think Chile filed an application.     I don't&#13;
&#13;
think I ever saw it, but I know there was some difficulty about&#13;
&#13;
that, because of some suggestion that the US executive director&#13;
&#13;
intimated to Chile that they'd get the loan.      There may have been&#13;
&#13;
others.     Very soon, of course, we get away from this whole&#13;
&#13;
concept of loan applications; it became discussions, and you&#13;
&#13;
filed the request for a loan after you decided to grant a loan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I don't understand that.     Will you explain this?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     I would not know who to give credit to for this&#13;
&#13;
approach.     I know Collado's experience in representing State in&#13;
&#13;
Export-Import Bank deliberations could have been one source of&#13;
&#13;
origin.     Another could have been McLain or McCloy.      But the Bank&#13;
&#13;
was very careful early in the game, and I think it's still the&#13;
&#13;
case today -- no country files an application for a loan until it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  - 39 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
has been decided to grant that loan, so that no country is in the&#13;
&#13;
position of having been formally turned down in an application by&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank.   These things are done informally.   The country&#13;
&#13;
will come in and say, "We've got a project."    Well, let's look it&#13;
&#13;
over, let's get the data.    Never any application, until you&#13;
&#13;
finally got the thing to the point where you're satisfied that&#13;
&#13;
this is a loan that can be made, and they say, "Well, let's put&#13;
&#13;
something in the files."    But diplomatically and politically it's&#13;
&#13;
obviously the proper way to act.    Countries do not like to lose&#13;
&#13;
face by announcing that the World Bank rejected their loan today.&#13;
&#13;
And yet, if you were to look at it as a practical matter, in the&#13;
&#13;
early days the Bank would have had to reject hundreds of&#13;
&#13;
applications because they weren't well conceived, in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
problems of that time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Have you any idea how the Bank got started on its&#13;
&#13;
investigation of the French loan?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:   Well, I have, and I've had discussions with the French,&#13;
&#13;
off the record discussions with them early in the game on that&#13;
&#13;
one, and I told them that it was going to create some real&#13;
&#13;
problems for the Bank in terms of being the first loan, because&#13;
&#13;
as far as I could see it was basically a balance of payments&#13;
&#13;
loan.   They said, "Well, we've got a plan," and I said that was&#13;
&#13;
going to be their job to sell to the Bank, but this was a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 40 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
project, a specific project within the terms of the articles of&#13;
&#13;
agreement for the Bank to finance.&#13;
&#13;
             You might be interested in talking to my partner John&#13;
&#13;
Pehle who served as counsel for the French on those loan&#13;
&#13;
negotiations, and I'm sure that he could give you a better fill&#13;
&#13;
in on what the French were thinking about than I could.&#13;
&#13;
             I was in -- I'm not sure, I think I was in Geneva when&#13;
&#13;
that loan was negotiated.     I was there on the ITO (International&#13;
&#13;
Trade Organization, i.e. GATT) so that my knowledge of that&#13;
&#13;
particular loan is only at the very early stage, and I think I&#13;
&#13;
went over one of the loan agreements on it, one of the final&#13;
&#13;
drafts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Was there any feeling on the part of the Bank staff or&#13;
&#13;
elsewhere that operations were moving very slowly?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     Oh, yes, there was a great deal of feeling of that&#13;
&#13;
character.     I think that you had a feeling that in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
Meyer regime -- I'm going back now from the French loan, going&#13;
&#13;
back to the Meyer regime -- that damn little was being&#13;
&#13;
accomplished.     That there were too many board meetings and very&#13;
&#13;
little time being addressed to the actual day to day work of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.     It was a difficult time.   It takes real time to pick&#13;
&#13;
staff.     If you have -- what was my impression, that it was McLain&#13;
&#13;
and Meyer making the decisions, and they were busy fighting a&#13;
&#13;
flanking battle with the board, they had damn little time for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 41 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
anything else.      And Meyer -- from what little I saw of him, in&#13;
&#13;
discussing problems with him after he became president, I was&#13;
&#13;
disillusioned, very quickly disillusioned, not at all in terms of&#13;
&#13;
the man or in terms of his point of view, but in terms of -- as&#13;
&#13;
far as I was concerned, he was senile.          I mentioned to you&#13;
&#13;
earlier that -- the illustration that he used to me in talking&#13;
&#13;
about the French loan the first time was, "Well, the French are&#13;
&#13;
going to come in and want to borrow a lot of French francs."&#13;
&#13;
               I rather patiently explained to him that the French&#13;
&#13;
didn't need to come to us for French francs, they'd be coming for&#13;
&#13;
dollars.      It took a long while to explain that to him, only on&#13;
&#13;
the basis that, like most American bankers, he had a banking&#13;
&#13;
background with the board of governors 1 -- they didn't then know&#13;
&#13;
beans about foreign exchange, they didn't know beans about&#13;
&#13;
balance of payments problems, and to him the problem was as&#13;
&#13;
simple as though they were going to lend French francs to the&#13;
&#13;
French.      So I would have to say that Meyer never came to grips&#13;
&#13;
with the problems of the Bank, and I question whether or not he&#13;
&#13;
had the vigor and vitality at his age to do it.           As a&#13;
&#13;
consequence, McLain was de facto president of the Bank.           When we&#13;
&#13;
talk about Meyer, it's my impression that it was a battle between&#13;
&#13;
McLain and Collado.       My relationship was never particularly close&#13;
&#13;
to McLain.      You could expect that it might not be, my having been&#13;
&#13;
appointed before he was.          I tried to cooperate.   I think he&#13;
&#13;
respected me.      Obviously his background was utterly different&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
    i.e., Federal Reserve Board&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      - 42 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
than mine, his approach to problems was utterly different.         He&#13;
&#13;
was a practicing lawyer, a trial lawyer, and thought you slugged&#13;
&#13;
things out, whereas in government very frequently you should&#13;
&#13;
negotiate about them, especially in dealing with foreign&#13;
&#13;
countries.     There's no need to insult them.      There's no need of&#13;
&#13;
assuming that anybody who'd had previous government experience&#13;
&#13;
was either a bureaucrat or a longhair and couldn't be practical.&#13;
&#13;
Yet that was the feeling I think that McLain, coming out of the&#13;
&#13;
Cravath law firm, (Cravath, Henderson and de Gersdorff) had -- I&#13;
&#13;
think he had that attitude toward government and government&#13;
&#13;
people.    He felt that he was making a great sacrifice to work&#13;
&#13;
with the Bank, undoubtedly he was making a financial sacrifice.&#13;
&#13;
That's a decision you make, and you can't keep resenting that and&#13;
&#13;
resenting the people you're working with on account of it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Were working parties set up during Meyer's regime to study&#13;
&#13;
loans?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     So far as I know, none.      There could have been.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Were any investigations of lending or borrowing made?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     My problem is this, that the Bank was set up on paper&#13;
&#13;
in April, May -- began to jell maybe within a month of that time,&#13;
&#13;
but by October -- as I recall, it was October -- I was over in&#13;
&#13;
London on the first meeting of ITO, six weeks at that time, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 43 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
beginning June the following year, there were problems on ITO&#13;
&#13;
that were going on even during this period, so a substantial part&#13;
&#13;
of my work was in a field not directly related to loan&#13;
&#13;
operations.   We were also researching various points on the legal&#13;
&#13;
side, issues that were coming up, and I introduced some research&#13;
&#13;
along those lines, but as far as actual loan discussions, I have&#13;
&#13;
little or no recollection of that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Were there any legal interpretations at this period which you&#13;
&#13;
think should be mentioned?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:   There were of course the legal interpretations that&#13;
&#13;
Congress had directed the US executive director to obtain&#13;
&#13;
interpretations on a couple of points, as an incident due to the&#13;
&#13;
fact of the Bretton Woods agreement, as part of a compromise.       In&#13;
&#13;
my personal opinion, there was a lot of fussing and laboring over&#13;
&#13;
a very obvious kind of law.   We would not have conceded for a&#13;
&#13;
minute these requests for interpretation unless we as lawyers&#13;
&#13;
know in advance that they were perfectly appropriate&#13;
&#13;
interpretations for the Bank to make.   In other words, we weren't&#13;
&#13;
going to start out by asking the Bank to make an interpretation&#13;
&#13;
that would run counter to its own articles of agreement.    But I&#13;
&#13;
know that there was an awful lot of time wasted around here, on&#13;
&#13;
interpretations.   And I thought the opinion we wrote was crazy.&#13;
&#13;
As I recall, there was very little reasoning to it, just, "I have&#13;
&#13;
spoken, this is it."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 44 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           In retrospect, there's a certain merit to not giving&#13;
&#13;
reasons, because they don't come to haunt you the next time you&#13;
&#13;
come to interpret, but at the time I thought it was much ado&#13;
&#13;
about nothing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I wonder if you could tell us --&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford: -- oh, there was another problem came up, and this was&#13;
&#13;
so vague in my recollection that I will not try to do more than&#13;
&#13;
point out that as an incident to our first bond issue, we -- the&#13;
&#13;
New York market, counsel for the New York investors, insisted on&#13;
&#13;
an opinion on the part of the board, not an opinion but an&#13;
&#13;
interpretation, which, given this long period of time and the&#13;
&#13;
fact that I wasn't here actually working on it -- I think I was&#13;
&#13;
in Geneva at the time -- was addressed to the availability of the&#13;
&#13;
US guarantee to cover these resources, and I think it also was&#13;
&#13;
addressed to the fact that the obligation of the United States to&#13;
&#13;
honor its guarantee was a binding obligation regardless of&#13;
&#13;
whether any country met its share of the guarantee.    It was not&#13;
&#13;
couched in terms of the United States, but the full purpose of it&#13;
&#13;
was to establish that when they bought the bonds, they were&#13;
&#13;
getting the specific guarantee of the United States, and the&#13;
&#13;
United States could never say, we don't have to because someone&#13;
&#13;
else has not.    That's what it was -- which was no serious&#13;
&#13;
problem, because that definitely was the intent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 45 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Could you tell us about the conditions of Mr. Meyer's leaving&#13;
&#13;
and Mr. McCloy's arriving?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     Only, again, and this you should check with men like&#13;
&#13;
Collado and Hooker -- I was in a peculiar position, in that&#13;
&#13;
McLain at that point (things changed later as we got better&#13;
&#13;
acquainted, but at that point) McLain, for probably good reasons,&#13;
&#13;
I'm just speculating, assumed that I must have been part of the&#13;
&#13;
(Collado) administration cabal, namely, that by virtue of my&#13;
&#13;
close ties with State, Treasury and the like in the past,&#13;
&#13;
obviously probably knew that I had something to do with ditching&#13;
&#13;
Lew Douglas -- could very well feel that I wasn't the guy he&#13;
&#13;
wanted to confide in with regard to problems he was having with&#13;
&#13;
Collado et al.     On the other hand, I had never been particularly&#13;
&#13;
close to Pete (Collado).     We were professional colleagues, he&#13;
&#13;
speaking for State on many occasions, me for Treasury.     I&#13;
&#13;
respected Pete a great deal and we were friendly, but again,&#13;
&#13;
given this posture of me being in the executive side of the Bank&#13;
&#13;
at a time when he was fighting in terms of the paramountcy of the&#13;
&#13;
executive directors, he had no particular interest in confiding&#13;
&#13;
in me.     I felt that I could not be in the position of going&#13;
&#13;
around the back of the Meyer-McLain group and dealing with&#13;
&#13;
Collado.     So it left me in a position of only hearing secondhand&#13;
&#13;
what was going on, and not firsthand, from either side.        I've&#13;
&#13;
never been particularly interested in the details of these kinds&#13;
&#13;
of battles.     You've been through hundreds of them when you're in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 46 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
government.     I would say this, that when the announcement of&#13;
&#13;
Meyer's resignation occurred, and there was this very substantial&#13;
&#13;
delay in naming a successor, I had the impression, very strong&#13;
&#13;
impression, McLain told me in so many words, that if Collado was&#13;
&#13;
named president he would resign on the spot.     Again that could&#13;
&#13;
have come through somebody else that he'd said that in board&#13;
&#13;
meeting.     It's too long to go to try to reconcile.    It's only the&#13;
&#13;
fact, out of that statement, that I'm certain of, and I think,&#13;
&#13;
after the resignation, I went around and talked to Pete, on one&#13;
&#13;
occasion that I can recall, and I asked him, "What the devil's&#13;
&#13;
happening here?"     And he said, "Well, it's a real knock down and&#13;
&#13;
drag out fight."&#13;
&#13;
             Then I said, "Pete, that's not good for the Bank, A,&#13;
&#13;
not to have a president, and B, not to be doing anything in the&#13;
&#13;
meantime."&#13;
&#13;
             He said, "Well, what can we do?"&#13;
&#13;
             I said, "In terms of your own position, if you want to&#13;
&#13;
knock the heart right out of the position of your opponents, put&#13;
&#13;
out a bond issue and put it out without waiting."       We could get&#13;
&#13;
one out in a month's time.     This could establish, once and for&#13;
&#13;
all, whether or not Wall St. can call the tune on our bond issue.&#13;
&#13;
Well, he didn't have the guts to do it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Could he have done it?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 47 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:    Why couldn't he?   He was de facto chairman of the&#13;
&#13;
board, the executive directors were with him.          But this would&#13;
&#13;
have been the beginning of the end -- either the issue would have&#13;
&#13;
been bought, or it wouldn't, and Pete and I were completely&#13;
&#13;
satisfied that when the chips were down, we'd been in the&#13;
&#13;
Treasury too long, you'd sell the issue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:    So you don't feel it was necessary to have Wall St.&#13;
&#13;
management in the Bank in order to sell the bonds?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:    Not for that reason.     Not for that reason, no.     I&#13;
&#13;
wouldn't have put out a big issue.          I just would have put out an&#13;
&#13;
issue big enough to demonstrate it could be done.&#13;
&#13;
            Just to finish up on that, following the announcement&#13;
&#13;
of McCloy's appointment, I had known McCloy when he was Assistant&#13;
&#13;
Secretary of the Army.    We were working on the liberated areas'&#13;
&#13;
problems with McCloy.    In fact, I'd gone out to the West Coast&#13;
&#13;
with McCloy on an emergency trip when he got into the problem of&#13;
&#13;
the Japanese on the West Coast, and the Army didn't know what to&#13;
&#13;
do.    They'd been given instructions to move them out of the&#13;
&#13;
cities, and on the other hand, their property was being grabbed&#13;
&#13;
by anyone who could take it.       There was no one protecting it, and&#13;
&#13;
so Treasury went out and we set up a protectorate system,&#13;
&#13;
blocking their property and setting up a system so that the&#13;
&#13;
Federal Reserve Bank would in effect take over temporarily the&#13;
&#13;
trusteeship and protectorship of the property.          But I had known&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   - 48 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McCloy before, and I thought that if we had to have a Wall Street&#13;
&#13;
man, he was obviously a very happy choice.       He happened to be&#13;
&#13;
married to -- his wife and Lew Douglas's wife are sisters, if I&#13;
&#13;
recall correctly.    But I soon got a call from one of his&#13;
&#13;
counsels, asking for advice on the tax side of the contract that&#13;
&#13;
McCloy was negotiating with the Bank.       I don't know why he called&#13;
&#13;
me instead of McLain.    Bear in mind, I'm sure that it was McLain&#13;
&#13;
that sold McCloy on taking this job.&#13;
&#13;
           So I went in to see McLain, I said, "Look, Collado's&#13;
&#13;
resignation has been forced, and if this is an indication that&#13;
&#13;
there isn't a place in the Bank for liberals or people who do not&#13;
&#13;
share your point of view on these operations, then I'm resigning&#13;
&#13;
too."&#13;
&#13;
           He said, "Oh, no.   Don't feel that at all.     You've&#13;
&#13;
conducted yourself throughout this with propriety.       You haven't&#13;
&#13;
been involved, and I don't want you in any respect to feel you&#13;
&#13;
can't express your view on anything any way you want to, and I&#13;
&#13;
want you to remain here."    Well, on that basis I was happy enough&#13;
&#13;
to ride along, and I'm glad I did.       But for a while I was very&#13;
&#13;
much upset.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   This interview you say was with McLain?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:   Yes.   This was after McCloy was appointed.     Well, with&#13;
&#13;
the arrival of McCloy, Black and Garner, you had the first move&#13;
&#13;
of the Bank towards really going into operations.       That would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 49 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
natural in the sense that there was no longer any debating in the&#13;
&#13;
board, they had time to do their work.     The board was a very&#13;
&#13;
chastened -- and curiously enough, as you'd expect of men who'd&#13;
&#13;
been Collado's supporters one day, they were just as warm in&#13;
&#13;
seeking to become the supporters of McCloy -- as would be&#13;
&#13;
natural.   Again, their personal feelings had nothing to do with&#13;
&#13;
what they had to do in terms of their responsibilities as&#13;
&#13;
government officers.     And in the final analysis, they obviously&#13;
&#13;
did not have the authority or courage to try to name Collado&#13;
&#13;
against the wishes of the United States, on the one hand, or the&#13;
&#13;
authority or courage to turn down the nomination by the United&#13;
&#13;
States, once McCloy was there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you know anything about the behind the scenes negotiations&#13;
&#13;
with the United States government itself on this issue?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:   I only know them again by hearsay, because I can't tell&#13;
&#13;
you for certain who's left who can give you this.     Some of it&#13;
&#13;
might come from McCloy.     I doubt it.&#13;
&#13;
           The very definite impression, and it's been told to me&#13;
&#13;
later on, was that the same fight that was going on here, Collado&#13;
&#13;
versus McLain, was also going on in the US government.     Whatever&#13;
&#13;
you may think of John Snyder -- I never thought he was a&#13;
&#13;
particularly strong Secretary of the Treasury -- he was new to&#13;
&#13;
his job at this point.     He was even newer in terms of what the&#13;
&#13;
hell is the Bank and the Fund.     And for the same reasons that I'm&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 50 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
certain Vinson was troubled about the threat of the bankers that&#13;
&#13;
they'd never sell a bond in New York, Snyder would have been&#13;
&#13;
troubled by the same thing.     At the same time, I think his&#13;
&#13;
instincts would have been to support Collado.       Otherwise there&#13;
&#13;
wouldn't have been any fight.     I'm certain that Collado did not&#13;
&#13;
come into this fight without the backing of NAC.       He was not&#13;
&#13;
carrying on a private little fight of his own.       He was in here&#13;
&#13;
battling with the authority of NAC.       But bear this in mind -- it&#13;
&#13;
was a NAC without a strong man as a chairman, and Collado was a&#13;
&#13;
strong man, an articulate man, and I'm sure that he would present&#13;
&#13;
these problems and the NAC say "Yes, yes, go ahead," -- not&#13;
&#13;
really focusing on what the implications were of what they were&#13;
&#13;
doing.     In other words, the Meyer-Collado fight was not something&#13;
&#13;
where Collado didn't have the backing of the United States.           If I&#13;
&#13;
criticize the United States it's probably that there was not&#13;
&#13;
close enough liaison within the United States to hearing the&#13;
&#13;
other side of the question, so that they turned out to look&#13;
&#13;
foolish.     Collado had very close relations of course with Will&#13;
&#13;
Clayton, who was the acting NAC member I believe at that time for&#13;
&#13;
the State Department.&#13;
&#13;
             As a consequence -- well, Collado was always an&#13;
&#13;
ambitious man.     More power to him for being ambitious.     And also,&#13;
&#13;
devious, but not in a sense that I'm going to be critical of him.&#13;
&#13;
He'd been in infighting in government for long enough that he was&#13;
&#13;
an expert at it.     It just so happened he got licked.     But, to&#13;
&#13;
come back to your question -- in that context, I would say McCloy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 51 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
called the tune.    This is not a question of McCloy pushing for&#13;
&#13;
the job.    It was embarrassing.    It was comparable, to some&#13;
&#13;
extent, to the final appointment, the last month, of Woodword to&#13;
&#13;
be Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America, after 20&#13;
&#13;
people had turned it down.    Because, as I would put it, the&#13;
&#13;
bankers on the street wanted a clear-cut victory, no compromise.&#13;
&#13;
They wanted it -- they felt that they wanted it, or else.           The&#13;
&#13;
Treasury and the US government felt they had to have someone of&#13;
&#13;
that ilk.    McCloy was obviously -- could meet the qualifications&#13;
&#13;
from the point of view of the government, because the government&#13;
&#13;
knew McCloy was a man we would work with.         His work in the&#13;
&#13;
liberated areas was the clearest proof that the man had to&#13;
&#13;
appreciate the problems.&#13;
&#13;
            At the same time -- I think this was largely on the&#13;
&#13;
advice of McLain, and McLain and McCloy were extremely close.&#13;
&#13;
They'd come from the same law firm.         McLain was probably the&#13;
&#13;
stronger of the two, and I'm sure that he was the one that was&#13;
&#13;
dictating the terms for capitulation.         And in effect, the&#13;
&#13;
capitulation was that McCloy would take the job on the condition&#13;
&#13;
that the first time he didn't have complete US support, he&#13;
&#13;
resigned.    That's it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   He did resign in '49 â&#128;&#147;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:    -- that had nothing whatsoever to do with that.         That&#13;
&#13;
was to become High Commissioner in Berlin.         At the time of his&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   - 52 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
resignation, there was another battle going on in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
succession, essentially between Garner and Black.&#13;
&#13;
             But I think the conditions that McCloy laid down have&#13;
&#13;
been carried over as far as Black is concerned, not in terms of&#13;
&#13;
Black -- neither Black nor McCloy function in terms, say, of&#13;
&#13;
"take it or leave it," but I'm sure McLain hammered it out, and&#13;
&#13;
Black has had the benefit of that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Once Mr. McCloy became president, what sorts of policy&#13;
&#13;
decisions began to be made?     I wonder if you could talk about the&#13;
&#13;
rule of the economists in the early days in project planning and&#13;
&#13;
so on, some of the economic factors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     Well, I would say this to you -- that in the initial&#13;
&#13;
operating setup of the Bank was a single loan department, with a&#13;
&#13;
research department as a separate department, and in theory the&#13;
&#13;
head of research being on the same status as the head of the loan&#13;
&#13;
department and the head of the legal department.     And I would&#13;
&#13;
regard those three as the policy making departments of the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
where together they furnished the Bank with a pool of policy&#13;
&#13;
making.     McCloy's first step, of course, was bringing Garner in&#13;
&#13;
as vice president.     And Black in as head of -- well, as executive&#13;
&#13;
director on the one hand, and almost director of marketing on the&#13;
&#13;
other.     In fact, he brought in a man from Bankers Trust who took&#13;
&#13;
the position, a good man, but Black's job was to go out of here&#13;
&#13;
and sell those bonds, and indeed he was the sweetest bond&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 53 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
salesman you've ever seen.     The technical problems of selling the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's bonds were real, in terms of its long-range program.          You&#13;
&#13;
had to get the laws changed in various states.        You had to sell -&#13;
&#13;
- well, is the security behind these bonds?        Especially if you're&#13;
&#13;
going to have a big market and an active market for the&#13;
&#13;
securities.&#13;
&#13;
          Black had wonderful experience of this character in&#13;
&#13;
New York, his last place being with Chase, and that was his job.&#13;
&#13;
But in time he developed a much broader basis.        He was not a&#13;
&#13;
narrow gauge salesman.     You see the results today.&#13;
&#13;
          But Garner represented, at least in my opinion, the&#13;
&#13;
McLain mentality -- very provincial initially in his outlook,&#13;
&#13;
extremely suspicious that any foreigner was probably going to try&#13;
&#13;
to cheat you.     If there was a polite way to say something to&#13;
&#13;
someone who was discussing a loan and an impolite way, he would&#13;
&#13;
unconsciously select the impolite way.     This is not any&#13;
&#13;
reflection.     Garner didn't know he was rude.     Garner, in the&#13;
&#13;
Southern tradition, could be very courtly.        But when his banking&#13;
&#13;
tradition would get the better of him, and he was judging these&#13;
&#13;
in terms of "they're all probably lousy goddamned loans," and he&#13;
&#13;
had the feeling, like a banker in this country can call the tune&#13;
&#13;
on most corporations in terms of, "these are the terms you're&#13;
&#13;
going to get for credit, and you change your operations this way&#13;
&#13;
or else   " that rubbed off on almost every interview you'd have,&#13;
&#13;
in the early days.     Obviously Garner's come an awfully long ways,&#13;
&#13;
and so did McLain, in his period of time, but in terms of their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 54 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
initial posture, I don't think there was a borrower that came in&#13;
&#13;
to borrow from the Bank that didn't just hate Garner's guts, and&#13;
&#13;
perhaps McLain's, in the early days.&#13;
&#13;
          Nevertheless, Garner was an operator, and every&#13;
&#13;
division head reported to Garner.         I don't know whether McLain&#13;
&#13;
did or not.   I doubt that -- even in terms of the chart -- I&#13;
&#13;
think on the chart, he probably did, though.         But the fact is,&#13;
&#13;
the Bank was then being run by McCloy, McLain, and Garner.         Black&#13;
&#13;
sat in on what was going on, but in the early days I don't think&#13;
&#13;
he was having any real impact on policy.         It was those three,&#13;
&#13;
with McLain and Garner being the intellectual doers of the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
-- McCloy has a very fine mind and very deep understanding, but&#13;
&#13;
the execution was occurring primarily through Garner and McLain,&#13;
&#13;
and the negotiations would end up in their hands, as against&#13;
&#13;
McCloy getting himself into the middle of these negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
          And Garner is a good administrator.         But Garner was&#13;
&#13;
presiding over staff loan committees most of the time.         McCloy&#13;
&#13;
would be, if he were in and present, but whether McCloy was there&#13;
&#13;
or not, Garner had his piece to say, and it took a courageous man&#13;
&#13;
to talk back to Garner, particularly when you would have the&#13;
&#13;
impression, rightly or wrongly, that before the meeting there'd&#13;
&#13;
been an earlier meeting of Garner, McCloy and McLain, at which&#13;
&#13;
the problem had been resolved.    Now we go to staff loan committee&#13;
&#13;
meetings, and pass on these problems.&#13;
&#13;
          Well, it took a very courageous man to stand up and&#13;
&#13;
say, "I don't agree with what you're doing," because Garner or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 55 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
McLain, depending on which one had had a breakfast that didn't&#13;
&#13;
agree with him, would bang you over the head.     Still, if you were&#13;
&#13;
persistent -- I don't want to exaggerate, but it wasn't a&#13;
&#13;
pleasant thing -- to people who had tough enough skins, yes, you&#13;
&#13;
could do it.   But I'm thinking of particular foreign nationals in&#13;
&#13;
positions of responsibility.   It must have been a rude awakening&#13;
&#13;
to them, to be treated as though they didn't know what the hell&#13;
&#13;
they were talking about, whether they did or they didn't.&#13;
&#13;
          But this problem was not so bad for Iliff, in the loan&#13;
&#13;
department, in the sense that they had concrete proposals, and&#13;
&#13;
were supposed to be servicing a loan application, which --&#13;
&#13;
McCloy, Garner, or McLain wanted to make loans.&#13;
&#13;
          But it was the unfortunate role, and yet the necessary&#13;
&#13;
role, of the economists to first have to establish a credit basis&#13;
&#13;
(what is the long-term prognosis for this kind of thing?) and if&#13;
&#13;
you had the instinctive feeling of a man like Garner, at least at&#13;
&#13;
this time, that none of them were any darned good, what are those&#13;
&#13;
long-haired professors trying to tell me they're good for?     So it&#13;
&#13;
was awfully easy to sneer at them, even though their material&#13;
&#13;
ultimately went into the loan committee report that would go up&#13;
&#13;
to the Bank's board of executive directors and be considered.     It&#13;
&#13;
wasn't a pleasant job.   The economists were infinitely more&#13;
&#13;
cognizant of the nature of the problem the Bank was dealing with,&#13;
&#13;
its inadequacy in terms of the magnitude of the problem, and in&#13;
&#13;
terms also of the inadequacies of the policies that were evolving&#13;
&#13;
in terms of the Bank, and to the extent that they would address&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               - 56 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
themselves to that, they took the brunt of the Garner-McLain&#13;
&#13;
anger.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Can you illustrate this difference of opinion with respect to&#13;
&#13;
any specific loan, for example, or issue?     Is this a difference&#13;
&#13;
in just looking at things from the financial point of view, or&#13;
&#13;
looking at them from the total economic point of view?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     Well, I will illustrate it in many ways.   Let me try to&#13;
&#13;
give you a couple.     McCloy's first speeches always carried this&#13;
&#13;
note:    "I'm in a temporary job with an institution that I hope is&#13;
&#13;
temporary.     Our job is to be the catalytic agent to get private&#13;
&#13;
investment back into the international field.     You couldn't&#13;
&#13;
possibly provide the financing that's going to be necessary for&#13;
&#13;
economic development in all of these countries.     They have got to&#13;
&#13;
provide the basis of good economic climate to permit and attract&#13;
&#13;
foreign capital.     But the happiest day of my life will be the day&#13;
&#13;
we can close the Bank up and say we've done our job and private&#13;
&#13;
capital has now moved in to take over the job."&#13;
&#13;
             Now, it is not for me to say whether that was not&#13;
&#13;
merely a technique of getting the camel's head under the tent of&#13;
&#13;
American confidence, on the one hand, or whether McCloy really&#13;
&#13;
believed it.     I could state the statements as made and perhaps&#13;
&#13;
agree with them -- if American private capital will do the job,&#13;
&#13;
fine, you don't need any World Bank, I agree with that.      But it&#13;
&#13;
begs the question as to whether or not there was any possibility&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 57 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of private capital doing the stuff.      And I think that it was&#13;
&#13;
shocking to the staff, it was shocking I think to the people on&#13;
&#13;
the staff who had done any thinking on this problem -- I'm not&#13;
&#13;
talking about the operating people, I'm talking about economists&#13;
&#13;
and others who had been working with it for a period of time --&#13;
&#13;
to hear this kind of statement being made.      They just didn't ring&#13;
&#13;
true.   They didn't ring sincere.   Either they were the product of&#13;
&#13;
ignorance, or of bad public relations.      And there would be&#13;
&#13;
complaints about that.   "What are you making these kinds of&#13;
&#13;
statements for?"   But you got short shrift on that.     I always&#13;
&#13;
thought that the fellow who wrote the speeches for an important&#13;
&#13;
political officer or anyone else was making policy in a very&#13;
&#13;
fundamental form, because once you get the man to make the&#13;
&#13;
statement, he begins to believe it, until somebody writes a&#13;
&#13;
speech to a different effect.&#13;
&#13;
           Now, I give that as one illustration.     The second type&#13;
&#13;
of illustration I would give is the great difficulty some of the&#13;
&#13;
economists had of educating the operating people, Black, Garner,&#13;
&#13;
McCloy, McLain, to the proposition that the countries of Europe,&#13;
&#13;
in going through their programs of reconstruction, were in&#13;
&#13;
desperate need of what amounted to balance of payments loans;&#13;
&#13;
that they had reproductive capacity to produce the heavy capital&#13;
&#13;
goods, even despite the war, for a good part of their&#13;
&#13;
reconstruction, but what was happening was that that was placing&#13;
&#13;
a very serious burden on their balance of payments, in terms of&#13;
&#13;
consumption goods that they needed.      To give full credit to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 58 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
management of the Bank, there is no question about the fact that&#13;
&#13;
this stretched the Articles of Agreement, but the Articles of&#13;
&#13;
Agreement had a provision just for this purpose, "except in&#13;
&#13;
special circumstances."     And the economists hammered away at it,&#13;
&#13;
and I think many of them had their morale broken, in terms of&#13;
&#13;
being shouted down.    Finally the Bank went along with it.&#13;
&#13;
          I think the Italian loan is the loan that I first&#13;
&#13;
associate that with.     It was just about the time I left the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank properly and early took the position that it couldn't&#13;
&#13;
meet the problems of reconstruction in terms of the need in the&#13;
&#13;
postwar period, having Lend-Lease cut off on the one hand and the&#13;
&#13;
cold war on the other.     And it really saw no reason to make a&#13;
&#13;
loan where there was not sufficient resources to make the economy&#13;
&#13;
viable, and that was the problem.         We were dealing with it in&#13;
&#13;
large parts of Europe.&#13;
&#13;
          The need for Marshall Plan aid was obvious, but that&#13;
&#13;
called for real soul searching on the part of the Bank.         I think&#13;
&#13;
McCloy did a -- I compliment him on his speech there.         He urged&#13;
&#13;
the Congress not to make fuzzy loans that would only undermine&#13;
&#13;
the ability of the Bank to make loans subsequently; what they&#13;
&#13;
needed was in effect grants.&#13;
&#13;
          I would probably be critical myself that the Bank did&#13;
&#13;
not play a larger role in the administration of the Marshall Plan&#13;
&#13;
funds, one way or another, or seek to play a larger role.         I can&#13;
&#13;
see why the Bank, from its own point of view, would say, "Let's&#13;
&#13;
not get ourselves confused with an agency that on the one hand is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 59 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
making grants, on the other hand is making loans.     There'll be a&#13;
&#13;
temptation to make too many grants and not enough loans or vice&#13;
&#13;
versa."&#13;
&#13;
           Be that as it may from an institutional point of view,&#13;
&#13;
my regret is primarily that, giving Marshall Aid more of an&#13;
&#13;
international consultation premise, you would have been better&#13;
&#13;
off.   Now, we did that in the early OEEC, where in effect you&#13;
&#13;
said to the countries, "You work out your needs and thrash out&#13;
&#13;
amongst yourselves what you're going to do in terms of&#13;
&#13;
formulating the program and implementing it."     To that extent,&#13;
&#13;
OEEC filled a bill that the Bank might have filled on its own.&#13;
&#13;
It could be very well said that this should be the countries&#13;
&#13;
involved directly and not the rest of the world.     I think the&#13;
&#13;
Bank could have been more helpful than that, but I see it in a&#13;
&#13;
broader context, that ICA aid seemed to be a matter of merely&#13;
&#13;
financing Western Europe, as it did within a reasonably short&#13;
&#13;
period of time, left the United States with what I regard as a&#13;
&#13;
ridiculous position with the rest of the world.&#13;
&#13;
           I'm amazed even today when I go out to a country like&#13;
&#13;
Turkey to see huge apartment buildings -- all filled as offices&#13;
&#13;
for U.S. ICA experts -- for one little country, Turkey.        Yet I&#13;
&#13;
know if I want information on Turkey I can get far better&#13;
&#13;
information out of the Fund and get it in a minute.     It's&#13;
&#13;
Parkinson's Law at its worst.   And I know if somebody wants to&#13;
&#13;
talk to Turkey, the people in the Fund who know the Turks can&#13;
&#13;
talk to them far better than our people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                - 60 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Ansel F. Luxford&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             What we have done, by trying to push full economic&#13;
&#13;
control in each country, has meant that we just loaded ourselves&#13;
&#13;
with such amount of personnel that it's criminal.      The Bank and&#13;
&#13;
Fund, with their small staffs, probably are doing just as good a&#13;
&#13;
job.     And politically, the United States is in the very bad&#13;
&#13;
position of having to call the tune, instead of having an&#13;
&#13;
international institution calling the tune.&#13;
&#13;
             I made a speech not long ago, that this part of the&#13;
&#13;
program of Kennedy for Latin America had not been given&#13;
&#13;
sufficient emphasis, of forcing the countries to work out jointly&#13;
&#13;
their sights, rather than having the United States say "You don't&#13;
&#13;
get any aid if you can't do thus and so."&#13;
&#13;
             I think to revert back to illustrations of what was&#13;
&#13;
wrong in the early days of the Bank, the Bank's management&#13;
&#13;
misconceived the amount that it could dictate to a country by&#13;
&#13;
virtue of lending them money.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:     I would like to ask about the feeling of other governments&#13;
&#13;
that you have approached with respect to fiscal and monetary&#13;
&#13;
policies, but we're almost at the end of this tape, so I wonder&#13;
&#13;
if we'd better stop for the moment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Luxford:     All right.   I'll be around here, and if there are&#13;
&#13;
further things you want from time to time, let me know.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
