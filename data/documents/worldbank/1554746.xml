Abstract&#13;
Until recently data on the economy of China have been scarce. In&#13;
this paper we take a first look at private household consumption in China,&#13;
using data for 1981 and 1982 published in the Statistical Yearbooks of&#13;
China. We first show current consumption patterns, make s,ome,simple&#13;
extrapolations for the period 1983-2000 based on various,growth scenarios,&#13;
and then estimate the Extended Linear Expenditur,e'System (EUES) for China&#13;
Income, own-price and cross-price elasticities are also presented.    The&#13;
analyses are preceded by historical data for the period 1949-1979.&#13;

Hasta hace poco tiempo, los datos sobre la economia de China han&#13;
sido escasos.  En este documento consideramos el consumo privado de las&#13;
unidades familiares en China, utilizando datos correspondientes a 1981 y&#13;
1982 publicados en los anuarios estadisticos del pais. Mostramos primero&#13;
las pautas actuales del consumo, efectuamos algunas extrapolaciones&#13;
sencillas para el periodo de 1983-2000 sobre la base de varias hip6tesis&#13;
de crecimiento y luego estimamos el Sistema Lineal Ampliado de Gasto&#13;
(SLAG) correspondiente al pais. Antes de iniciar los analisis, se&#13;
presentan los datos del periodo de 1949-1979.&#13;

1. Introduction&#13;
"Under the socialist system, the structure&#13;
of the people's consumption occupies an im-&#13;
portant position in the structure of the&#13;
national economy. This is because raising&#13;
the level of the people's consumption is an&#13;
objective of socialist production, and also&#13;
a final goal of the all economic activities.&#13;
In expanding production and conducting all&#13;
kinds of economic activities, our objective&#13;
is none other than to ensure the highest de-&#13;
gree of satisfaction of the growing material&#13;
and cultural needs of the laboring people.&#13;
Therefore, in studying the structure of the&#13;
national economy, we cannot but attach great&#13;
importance to the structure of the people's&#13;
consumption."&#13;
Yang Shenming&#13;
The Structure of People's Consumpt-i-on&#13;
This study of household consumption in China is part of a cooperative&#13;
research project between staff members of the Chinese Academy of Social&#13;
Sciences (CASS) and the World Bank. The ultimate aim of this project is to&#13;
improve our understanding of current household consumption patterns in China&#13;
and, based on this, to make reliable projections of future developments.l/&#13;
Chinese scholars distinguish between three types of household&#13;
consumption: First there is private household consumption, paid for out of&#13;
the household's income. Households also consume goods and services free of&#13;
charge or at reduced prices. Free movies, excursions, and lunches provided by&#13;
some department are examples, together with subsidies (for the non-farm&#13;
population) for grains, vegetables and non-staple foods. The direct subsidies&#13;
1/ This paper analyzes household consumption data that are currently&#13;
available for China. A comparison paper, partly based on the analysis of&#13;
the same data, is under preparation by the staff at CASS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

for these food products are estimated at more than 20 billion yuan, or 20&#13;
percent of total state expenditures.!" In addition there are large subsidies&#13;
for, for instance, housing expenditures for various groups of workers, which&#13;
can be viewed as part of the total employment compensation package, but which&#13;
do not show up in the expenditure data. Clearly, these subsidies affect a&#13;
household's well being. In this study, however, we ignore their value.2/&#13;
Thirdly there is social collective consumption, i.e., consumption&#13;
that satisfies "communal needs of the members of society by using social&#13;
consumption funds" (Shenming, op cit, p. 19). The cost for education,&#13;
scientific research and health care are examples of this, to the extent that&#13;
they are paid for by collective funds. All pure public goods (defense,&#13;
general administration) are also part of social collective consumption.&#13;
This study analyzes the first category of consumption only. As such&#13;
it is part of the large body of economic literature that studies the&#13;
relationship between household consumption and economic well being. This&#13;
literature contains more than a century of work on a large variety of&#13;
theoretical and empirical issues in this area. Up to the point that sophis-&#13;
ticated and theoretically elegant consumer demand models are now routinely&#13;
used by economic researchers interested in such issues as household welfare,&#13;
the distributional consequences of subsidies and taxation, individual labor&#13;
market behaviour and, of course, the consequences of future income and price&#13;
changes on the development of the demand for consumption goods and services.&#13;
1/ Yang 1981, p. 18.&#13;
2/ I.e., the value of consumption is evaluated at the subsidized price.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
A large part of the empirical research in this area is based on&#13;
aggregated time-series data, relating developments over time, in total or per&#13;
capita consumption to price and income changes. Unfortunately, for the&#13;
current study only sketchy information is available on changes in consumption&#13;
patterns over time. Instead, this study will analyze various sets of cross-&#13;
section data. In particular, we will utilize interprovincial differences in&#13;
per capita consumption for 1981 and 1982 and consumption data by income class&#13;
for rural and urban areas in selected years.&#13;
The analysis of cross-section consumption data has a long tradition&#13;
and, among many other results, has produced what may well be the most robust&#13;
empirical law in the economic literature, Engel's Law, which states that the&#13;
proportion of income spent on food declines when income rises. In Figure 1.1&#13;
we illustrate this Law using cross-section data from 16 countries. The income&#13;
effect on the food share is very pronounced. In Figure 1.2 we present a&#13;
similar picture, using data on China's provinces. The same negative income&#13;
slope emerges.'/&#13;
It is this strong income-consumption relationship that will be&#13;
utilized in this study to obtain quantitative information about the changes in&#13;
China's household consumption patterns that are likely to result from further&#13;
economic growth.&#13;
1/ Note that Figure 1.1 uses the logarithm of income on the horizontal axis,&#13;
while Figure 1.2 uses income.&#13;

In the next section we will present information on the historical&#13;
development of consumption in China since the liberation. This section is&#13;
based on a large number of publications and reports that have become available&#13;
during the course of this project.&#13;
In Section 3 we analyze the provincial cross-section data in&#13;
detail. We present a first projection of per capita and total demand for&#13;
consumer goods and services, based on various income growth scenarios, and a&#13;
"best guess" on population growth. In this section we also discuss various&#13;
sources of uncertainty that affect our projections.&#13;
In Section 4 we present a formal model of household consumption&#13;
behavior. We estimate the resulting consumer demand equations using the&#13;
available consumption data grouped by income. The particular form of the&#13;
model allows us to calculate price elasticities in addition to income&#13;
elasticities. To illustrate the price effects, we show what impact an&#13;
increase in the relative price of food will have on food consumption.&#13;
In Section 5 we discuss the main results and make suggestions for&#13;
further research.&#13;

2. Historical Perspective: 1949-1979&#13;
In the first three decades after liberation, i.e., from 1949-1979,&#13;
China's population grew at an average rate of just under two percent per&#13;
year. National income grew at an average annual rate of about six percent.&#13;
Thus there has been ample room for improvements in the people's level of well&#13;
being. In this section we will document to what extent this potential for&#13;
improvement has been materialized in changes in household consumption&#13;
patterns.&#13;
No consistent time-series data of household consumption are available&#13;
for China. The following tables have been constructed from various sources,l/&#13;
none of which can be considered to be fully representative for the entire&#13;
Chinese population. Especially all data prior to 1957 should be interpreted&#13;
as rough estimates only. Generally the data are more representative for rural&#13;
areas (about 80 percent of the population) than for urban areas.&#13;
Not much is known about consumption patterns in -the period of&#13;
"Recovery", 1949-52. But the period of the first five year plan, 1952-57, is&#13;
fairly well documented. Over this period the output of the Chinese economy of&#13;
"subsistence goods", i.e., agriculture and handicraft, increased approximately&#13;
46.5 percent (in constant 1952 prices), an annual rate of increase of 7.9&#13;
percent. After reduction for export and the State's reserves, subsistence&#13;
goods available for household consumption grew at an annual rate of 7.2&#13;
percent.&#13;
1/ Tables 2.1-2.3 are based on one source only; see reference (10) in the&#13;
List of Literature.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Tables 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 show output figures for 1952 and 1957, for&#13;
selected food items, clothing and articles of daily use. Assuming that all&#13;
output is being consumed in this period, there has been some relative&#13;
development away from such basic, "subsistence", items as grain and cotton&#13;
cloth and in favor of more "luxury" items, such as meat, dairy products and&#13;
daily articles. This development implies a substantial improvement in the&#13;
people's level of living.   Nevertheless, by 1957, the budget share for food&#13;
was still as high as 67 percent (Table 2.4).    With the shares for clothing and&#13;
fuel at 10 and 12 percent, respectively, there was not much room in the budget&#13;
for housing, daily articles, culture and services, and other consumer goods.&#13;
The 1957 annual per capita food basket'included of 559 pounds of&#13;
unprocessed grain, 4.3 liters of vegetable oil, a little over 10 pounds of&#13;
meat (most of it pork), 291 pounds of vegetables and 3.4 pounds of poultry and&#13;
eggs (Table 2.5). This is, by all available standards, a quite adequate&#13;
diet.  However, the diet consists mainly of grain and vegetables, with very&#13;
little meat or other foodstuffs.&#13;
It is this same pattern of an adequate, but somewhat spartan diet,&#13;
with food expenditures taking about two-thirds of the household budget and,&#13;
consequently, little room for other consumer goods and services, that we find&#13;
back in China two decades later. In fact, if we compare 1979 with 1957, the&#13;
food share has not changed (Table 2.4) and food quantities have changed very&#13;
little (Table 2.5), though meat consumption increased from 10.2 to 15.8 pounds&#13;
per person.&#13;

This does not imply that the period 1957-79 can be characterized as a&#13;
period of relatively stable, though slow, economic development. On the&#13;
contrary, China saw some continuous economic growth in the beginning of the&#13;
second five year plan. But by 1959/60 the economy experienced a major&#13;
downturn, as is well illustrated by, for instance, the grain consumption data&#13;
for the early sixties (Table 2.5).&#13;
The "Great Leap Forward" was followed by ten years of Cultural&#13;
Revolution. One of the characteristics of this tumultuous phase in China's&#13;
history is the almost complete lack of reliable statistics. When in the late&#13;
seventies reliable statistics of the people's livelihood became available&#13;
again, it appeared that the average level of well being was only slightly&#13;
above that achieved at the end of the first five year plan.&#13;
As these data reveal, China's economic growth of about four percent&#13;
per capita annually, has not been used to improve the welfare level of Chinese&#13;
households. In fact, China's economic policies have emphasized investment in&#13;
heavy industry with the aim of accelerating growth. Consequently there has&#13;
not been much room for improvements in household consumption patterns.&#13;
The economic reforms of the late seventies and early eighties are&#13;
quickly changing this stagnant pattern. Not only does the accelerated&#13;
economic growth increase the total demand for consumer goods, the improved&#13;
living standards of (in particular) the peasants also substantially change the&#13;
composition of consumer expenditures. In the next sections we will take a&#13;
closer look at some recent household consumption data for China.&#13;

published in the Statistical Yearbooks of China for 1981 and 1982. These&#13;
yearbooks publish provincial data on total per capita consumption expenditures&#13;
of peasants, plus a breakdown in expenditures on food, housing, clothing and&#13;
various other consumption items.!" The data stem from a nationwide survey&#13;
among peasant households. The survey is conducted yearly and includes data on&#13;
18,000 households in 1,700 communes. In Table 3.1 we present summary&#13;
statistics for both years.&#13;
China experienced an increase in per capita consumption from 200.19&#13;
yuan in 1981 to 229.58 in 1982.21 For both years by far the largest budget&#13;
share was for food, which accounts for 60 percent of total expenditures. Food&#13;
is further divided in three components: staple food, non-staple food and a&#13;
rest category, "other". Staple food includes food grains and beans. Non-&#13;
staple food refers to vegetables, pork, beef, mutton, fish, poultry, eggs,&#13;
edible oils, sugar, salt and spices. The category other foods include fruit,&#13;
milk, cookies, tobacco, wine, tea and meals consumed in restaurants. Note&#13;
that this third category increased most, relatively speaking, from 1981 to&#13;
1982.&#13;
1/ See Tables 1 and 2, p. 445-448, in the Statistical Yearbook 1981 and the&#13;
same Tables in the Statistical Yearbook 1982. Data are given for 28&#13;
provinces; no data is available for Tibet.&#13;
2/ These are the unweighted averages of the reported provincial data. The&#13;
Statistical Yearbooks present weighted averages equal to 190.81 (US$98.36)&#13;
and 220.23 z (US$113.52), respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
Clothing, housing and daily articles show approximately equal budget&#13;
shares of 10 to 12 percent. Clothing includes the consumption of cotton,&#13;
wool, silk and chemical fibers. All purchases in one year are counted as&#13;
consumption for that year.&#13;
The housing category mainly includes expenditures for building&#13;
materials for new houses or house improvements. Rents and payments for&#13;
utilities are negligible in rural China. This particular definition of&#13;
housing expenditures should be kept in mind while interpreting the results&#13;
presented in the next sections.&#13;
The category daily articles consists mainly of utensils and small&#13;
appliances. It also includes bicycles, radios,,television sets, wrist watches&#13;
and furniture.&#13;
Fuel takes only five percent of the budget. Fuel is mainly used for&#13;
cooking purposes. The category consists of firewood, charcoal and plant&#13;
stalks. We finally see that-an average peasant household spends between one&#13;
and two percent of its budget on culture and services.&#13;

3.2 Engel Curves 1981, 1982&#13;
We will use these data to estimate Engel curves of the form&#13;
Xi= f(Y)                    i = 1, ..., K&#13;
with               Xi: expenditures on item i&#13;
K&#13;
Y : total expenditures ( I    xi = Y)&#13;
We employed two functional forms: the linear form xi = a. + 8iY, and the share&#13;
log form, i.e., x /Y    a' + 81 in Y.   We estimated the Engel curves using the&#13;
pooled data for 1981-and 1982.!'    The results are given in Table 3.2.    As&#13;
expected the effect of total expenditures on consumption of each item is very&#13;
significant-. As measured by the R2, the regressions are quite successful in&#13;
explaining interprovincial differences in per capita consumption. Notable&#13;
exceptions are staple food, for which, in the linear form, we explain only 23&#13;
percent of the variation, fuel (R2 = 0.201) and culture and services&#13;
(0.249).  It should be noted that a large part of staple food and fuel is&#13;
distributed in kind, which may in part account for the weak relationship&#13;
between income and consumption.&#13;
1/ Earlier estimates, based on the 1981 and 1982 data separately, did not&#13;
show any significant difference between the two years.&#13;

We used the estimation results to calculate income elasticities at&#13;
the sample mean." (Table 3.3.) The income elasticity for food (linear form)&#13;
is 0.759, with non-staple food and other food items being clear luxuries.&#13;
Housing shows the highest income elasticity, ranging from 2.370 to 2.692&#13;
depending on the functional form chosen. Clothing, fuel and culture and&#13;
services are necessities, but articles of daily use show an income elasticity&#13;
that exceeds 1.0. With the exception of fuel, which as we have seen above has&#13;
a very small budget share, the income elasticities based on both functional&#13;
forms are very similar.&#13;
From these elasticities it becomes apparent that a rise in per capita&#13;
income will significantly alter current consumption patterns. The shares for&#13;
non-staple food, other food and housing will increase, while those for staple&#13;
food, clothing, fuel and culture and services will decrease, with an increase&#13;
in income. In the next subsections we will take a closer look at possible&#13;
changes in consumption patterns resulting from three alternative income growth&#13;
projections. But prior to doing so, we will present the estimation results-of&#13;
two additional functional forms.&#13;
1/ The income elasticity, ei, for the linear form equals&#13;
E.- S.Y/x. &#13;
The income elasticity, e., for the share-log form equals&#13;
e = (a Y/xj) + 1 .&#13;

First we will estimate an extension of the linear form:&#13;
i   a. +  i Y + ri Y   + 6.T&#13;
Second we will estimate an extension of the share log form:&#13;
z.   a  + Bi in y + y i (In y)2 + 6'iT&#13;
Thus, by including a squared income term in each regression, we can test&#13;
whether the original functional forms chosen are too restrictive. We also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
included a time dummy variable in the regression, which equals zero for 1981&#13;
and is equal to 1.0 for 1982. The estimation results are given in Tables 3.4A&#13;
and 3.4B.&#13;
The results of Table 3.4A indicate that the marginal budget share for&#13;
non-staple food is falling with income, while the marginal share for other&#13;
food increases. Also, the marginal share for fuel decreases significantly&#13;
when income rises, while the housing share increases. For all other items no&#13;
statistically significant effect of the squared income term is found. In&#13;
other words, for these items the functional forms with linear terms only seems&#13;
appropriate, at least within the range of observations. The time dummy&#13;
variable is only significant for staple food. This reflects the fact that in&#13;
1982 the value of distributed grain per capita was 13 percent higher than in&#13;
1981. For all other goods no structural shift is being observed. The same&#13;
pattern is shown in Table 3.4B, based on the share-log form.&#13;

3.3 Projecting Household Consumption in China, 1983-2000&#13;
The following projections are based on three scenarios for per capita&#13;
income growth in China:&#13;
high growth rates:     5 percent per year, 1982-1990&#13;
6 percent per year, 1990-2000&#13;
medium growth rates:   4 percent per year, 1982-1990&#13;
5 percent per year, 1990-2000&#13;
low growth rates:      3 percent per year, 1982-1990&#13;
4 percent per year, 1990-2000.&#13;
The medium growth projections imply an increase in per capita&#13;
expenditures from 238.76 yuan in 1983, to 314.20 yuan in 1990, to 511.79 yuan&#13;
in 2000.1/&#13;
In Figure 1 we illustrate the development of per capita consumption&#13;
in China, based on this medium growth income scenario and the estimation&#13;
results of the linear Engel curves.2-&#13;
Food expenditure will remain by far the largest budget share. Per&#13;
capita expenditures will grow from 137.83Y in 1983 to 171.70Y in 1990, to&#13;
260.40w in 2000.&#13;
In 1990 expenditures on staple and non-staple food will be about&#13;
equal. After that, non-staple food will take a larger share of the budget&#13;
than staple food. Expenditures on other food will growth rapidly, and reach&#13;
49.38V in 2000, up 174 percent from 1983.&#13;
1/ The numbers for the high growth rate are 241.06, 339.20 and 607.45,&#13;
respectively.   The low growth rate implies 236.47, 290.83, 430.39.     (See&#13;
Annex 1, for the results based on the high and low growth scenarios.)&#13;

Housing will increase from the fourth largest budget item, after&#13;
food, clothing and daily articles, to the second largest. Per capita&#13;
expenditures will grow from 29.64w in 1983 to 94.12w in 2000, an increase of&#13;
218 percent. Recall that the category housing consists mainly of expenditures&#13;
on building material for new houses and for house improvements. What we may&#13;
observe is a very fast transition from mud houses to brick houses. This&#13;
transition may be accelerated by changes in the regulations regarding home&#13;
and land ownership as well as by income growth. It is also made possible by&#13;
the relatively large savings amounts currently owned by peasant households.&#13;
It is therefore quite likely that the demand for housing will flatten out,&#13;
once the severe shortage in housing of acceptable quality is taken care of.&#13;
Clothing expenditures will increase modestly (65 percent); from 1985&#13;
on expenditures on daily articles will exceed those on clothing. Fuel&#13;
expenditures and expenditures on culture and services remain relatively small&#13;
budget items, with increases of 48 percent and 72 percent, respectively.&#13;
The results illustrated in Figure 1 are summarized in Table 3.4.&#13;
Since our projections are based on the assumption that prices remain constant,&#13;
the per capita expenditure projections correspond to increases in real&#13;
consumption. Table 3.5 also includes projections of the total growth of&#13;
consumer demand in China. These projections are based on a total population&#13;
growth of 7.976 percent until 1990 and 17.844 percent until 2000.&#13;
Our projections imply for the period 1982-2000 an average yearly&#13;
growth rate of total food consumption of 4.12 percent. The demand for staple.&#13;
food will increase a modest 1.01 percent per year and non-staple food will see&#13;
a 5.57 percent growth rate. The category other food will increase almost five&#13;
fold, at an annual rate of 9.30 percent.&#13;

The demand for clothing will double, which implies an annual increase&#13;
of just over four percent, while fuel consumption will grow less than three&#13;
percent per year. Housing and daily articles are fast growing budget items,&#13;
with annual growth rates of 9.21 and 6.17 percent respectively. Expenditures&#13;
on culture and services will grow about 4.34 percent per year.&#13;
Total expenditures are predicted to grow at an annual rate of 5.10&#13;
percent which, of course, is the direct result of our medium income growth&#13;
scenario and our assumptions regarding population growth.&#13;
In the next section we will address several factors that affect the&#13;
reliability of the projections.&#13;
3.4 Sources of Uncertainty&#13;
In the previous subsections we presented estimates of consumption in&#13;
China for the period 1983-2000, based on income growth projections, population&#13;
growth-projections and point estimates of income effects on consumption.&#13;
Clearly, our projections are riddled with uncertainties, some of which will be&#13;
discussed in this subsection.&#13;
First of all there are the uncertainties regarding the income&#13;
projections. We presented results based on three alternative income growth&#13;
patterns. Evaluation of the likelihood of,each of these. patterns, however, is&#13;
beyond the .scope of this paper. We also accept, without discussion, the&#13;
population growth scenario used in section 3.4 to obtain expectations&#13;
regarding total consumption.!'&#13;
1/ For a discussion of population projections see Timothy King, Population&#13;
Policy in China since 1950 and its Demographic and Economic Implications,&#13;
Health Sector Issues in China, Supplementary Paper No. 2, August 19,&#13;
1983. (This is an internal document with restricted circulation only.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
That still leaves ample room for uncertainty in our projections. At&#13;
least two sources of uncertainty are of a statistical/methodological nature:&#13;
the "fit" of the data to the model chosen and the choice of the model. We&#13;
will discuss these issues in some detail in subsections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2,&#13;
respectively. We will conclude this subsection with a brief discussion of&#13;
various other sources of uncertainty.&#13;
3.4.1 Statistical Uncertainty&#13;
We will discuss uncertainty issues regarding our projections using&#13;
per capita food consumption as an example.&#13;
The estimation results for the linear Engel curve for food showed the&#13;
following results&#13;
xfood = 30.653 +   0.449 Y&#13;
(0.02)&#13;
R     = 0.892.&#13;
(Table 3.4, p. 24.)&#13;
This equation was estimated using income data ranging from 135 yuan&#13;
to 444 yuan. The "fit" of the line through the data is quite good. Neverthe-&#13;
-2&#13;
less, the R of 0.892 shows that there is some unexplained variance in the&#13;
data. Perhaps more importantly, some of our income projections exceed the&#13;
maximum observed value: the high growth projection shows 607.45 yuan per&#13;
capita in year 2000.&#13;
In Figure 2 we drew the linear Engel curve for food, together with a&#13;
95 percent confidence interval.-1 The Figure shows that the size of this&#13;
interval grows rapidly when income increases.&#13;
1/ See Annex 3 for the calculation of this confidence interval.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
Based on the regression results we can make the following three&#13;
formal statements:&#13;
A.   For 1983,1/ there is a 95 percent chance that food consumption will&#13;
lie between 120.03 yuan and 155.64 yuan per capita.&#13;
B.   For 1990, there is a 95 percent chance that food consumption will lie&#13;
between 140.62 yuan and 202.78 yuan per capita.&#13;
C.   For 2000, there is a 95 percent chance that food consumption will lie&#13;
between 180.18 yuan and 340.61 yuan per capita.&#13;
Obviously, the uncertainty in our projections for the latter years,&#13;
e.g., a. range of 160 yuan,for the year 2000, is disturbingly large. Note that&#13;
-2&#13;
this is solely due to a less than perfect fit of the data (though a R      of&#13;
0.892 is generally considered to be quite good) and the fact that the medium&#13;
growth scenario predicts a per capita income that is a factor of 2.3 larger&#13;
than the mean income value for 1981/82. Fortunately this kind of uncertainty&#13;
is easy to quantify, and realistic scenarios for future developments can be&#13;
based on precisely specified probability statements. Other sources of&#13;
uncertainty are less easy to assess. We will discuss some of them in the next&#13;
sub-sections.&#13;
3.4.2 The Choice of the Model&#13;
Two other projections are. sketched in Figure 2. The first one is&#13;
based on regression results using the share-log form:&#13;
z = x/Y =a + 6 In Y&#13;
1/ We use the medium growth income projection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
which can be rewritten as&#13;
x      (a + B In Y) Y&#13;
to project per capita food expenditures rather than the budget share.&#13;
Within the range of actual observations, this functional form is very&#13;
close to the linear one. For instance, for 400 yuan total per capita&#13;
expenditures, the difference in predicted food consumption is only 2 yuan.&#13;
For 500 yuan, the difference in per capita food consumption is almost 9 yuan,&#13;
i.e., in this case the projection based on the share-log forms lies 3.4&#13;
percent below the linear projection.&#13;
The second alternative to the linear Engel curve that is sketched in&#13;
Figure 2 is the quadratic function:&#13;
2&#13;
Again, the difference with the linear form is small within the range of&#13;
observations, but widens with growing income. For 500 yuan total&#13;
expenditures, the linear form predicts 255.15 yuan, the quadratic form yields&#13;
230.33 yuan, 10 percent less.&#13;
Note that both alternative projections fall well within the 95&#13;
percent confidence interval calculated for the linear form. The statistical&#13;
uncertainty (uncertainty due to unexplained variance in the data) seems to&#13;
dominate the uncertainty due to our choice of a particular functional form.&#13;
This should not come as a surprise given that our estimation results showed&#13;
very little curvature in the data. There were some exceptions however,&#13;
notably for non-staple and. other food and fuel and housing.&#13;
Starting with the latter two commodities, recall that we found&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
statistically significant results when we added the quadratic income term to&#13;
the linear Engel curves. These results imply for housing an increase in the&#13;
marginal share and for fuel a decrease in the marginal share of consumption,&#13;
when income rises. This is illustrated in Figure 3.&#13;
We see that both for housing and fuel the difference between the&#13;
quadratic and the linear functional form is small, as long as we stay within&#13;
the range of observations. The differences quickly become fairly large when&#13;
we predict expenditure based on income levels outside the range of&#13;
observations. For housing the linear curve seems to underestimate&#13;
expenditures at high income levels, while the linear curve for fuel seems to&#13;
predict levels of expenditures that are too high.&#13;
These results seem counter-intuitive on various counts. As mentioned&#13;
in Section 3.4, one may expect a sharp rise in housing expenditures at modest&#13;
income levels followed by a tapering off once relatively high expenditure&#13;
levels are reached. On the other hand, we should mention that LLuch et al. do&#13;
find a slight tendency for the marginal propensity to consume to rise with&#13;
income. And perhaps the current expenditure levels, and even those projected&#13;
at a per capita income level of 450 or 500 yuan are still too low to expect a&#13;
slower increase. Nevertheless, a continuing growth in housing expenditures,&#13;
at an accelerating growth rate, seems to be an implausible scenario.&#13;
The extrapolation for fuel is quite unlikely. Recall the the current&#13;
fuel category consists mainly of wood and plant stalks used for cooking&#13;
purposes. It is perhaps plausible that the consumption of these fuel items&#13;
flattens out after an income level of approximately 300 yuan, as our results&#13;
indicate. However, an increase in living space, as suggested by our housing&#13;

projections, is likely to be accompanied by an increase in the demand for fuel&#13;
to be used for heating and light, in addition to cooking. This development,&#13;
resulting in an increase in the demand for coal and electricity,,is not&#13;
captured in our data. But if our projections on housing are correct, changes&#13;
in the demand for coal and electricity may be large.&#13;
The nonlinear extrapolations for non-staple food and other food items&#13;
are sketched in Figure 4. Once income exceeds about 400 yuan per capita, the&#13;
linear extrapolation significantly overestimates the quadratic one.!" The&#13;
latter one indicates that when per capita expenditures on non-staple food&#13;
reach a level of about 90 yuan at an income level of just over 400 yuan, the&#13;
steep growth pattern flattens out, and expenditures stay approximately at that&#13;
level.&#13;
The marginal budget share for other food increases with income. In&#13;
other words, expenditure on other food will continue to grow, and at an&#13;
increasing rate, when income rises. The linear extrapolation underestimates&#13;
expenditures at higher income levels (e.g., at an income level of 500 yuan the&#13;
linear function predicts 55 yuan but the quadratic function predicts 68 yuan&#13;
per capita expenditures on other food).&#13;
Thus, while for total food not much curvature could be detected, in&#13;
the data, a first look at the composition of food consumption at higher income&#13;
levels reveals fairly large changes. And for the more detailed food items the&#13;
choice of the functional form, to be used for the extrapolations, seems to be&#13;
of great importance. Consequently the projections presented in Table 3.5&#13;
should be adjusted accordingly.&#13;
1/ Which has to be preferred on statistical grounds since the quadratic&#13;
income term showed a significant effect (Table 3.4A).&#13;

3.4.3 Other Sources of Uncertainty&#13;
In the above sections we discussed two important sources of&#13;
uncertainty regarding our projections of consumption patterns: statistical&#13;
uncertainty and model choice. In doing so we completely ignored the&#13;
uncertainty due to possible variations in the income projections. In this&#13;
section we will briefly mention some other factors that impact on the&#13;
reliability of our projections.&#13;
First of all there is the usual problem of making "time-series"&#13;
projections based on "cross-section" data only. In doing so we make the&#13;
implicit assumption that our data stem from a stable ("equilibrated")&#13;
market. This assumption may very well be violated by the structural changes&#13;
that currently are taking place in China. Furthermore, the cross-section data&#13;
do not allow us to address dynamic issues that are relevant to projections&#13;
over time.&#13;
Second, we ignored some relevant measurement problems regarding the&#13;
consumption data. Some consumption items are, at least in part, received by&#13;
the household in the form of in-kind income. We can obtain some information&#13;
on this by comparing the Tables I and 2 of the Survey of Household Income and&#13;
Expenditures of Peasants by Province in the Statistical Yearbooks. The latter&#13;
Tables show cash expenditures only, ignoring consumption of items received in-&#13;
kind.&#13;
While per capita food expenditure averaged 117.71 yuan in 1981 and&#13;
136.52 yuan in 1982, cash expenditures were only 45.13 and 54.12 yuan,&#13;
respectively. In 1981, 10.66 yuan was consumed on fuel, of which 2.90 yuan&#13;
was spent in cash. For 1982 these numbers are 12.12 yuan of which 3.05 yuan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
was cash. No significant differences between "consumption" and "cash&#13;
expenditures" exist for the other items.&#13;
We suspected that this combination of cash expenditures and in-kind&#13;
consumption may have biased our estimation results for food and fuel. But, as&#13;
far as the available data allow us to test this, the estimated expenditure&#13;
slopes do not seem to be influenced by this complication (see Annex 5).&#13;
The third additional source of uncertainty regards relative price&#13;
changes, an issue we will address in the next section, after having presented&#13;
and discussed estimates of price elasticities.&#13;
We finally mention as a source of uncertainty the supply side of the&#13;
market. Up to now we have implicitly assumed that households can choose any&#13;
combination of consumer goods, being only restricted by their total&#13;
resources. From the current data, however, it is not clear whether shortages&#13;
for certain goods (and in certain provinces) existed during the two years of&#13;
observations and, if so, to what extent they influenced the observed con-&#13;
sumption patterns. If latent demand actually exceeded supply, for instance&#13;
for such items as building material for houses and consumer durables, our&#13;
demand projections for these items will exceed realized demand. Moreover, our&#13;
projections for the other items are then likely to be too low, unless all&#13;
money not spent on the restricted items is being saved, which seems unlikely.&#13;
Even if the effect of shortages during the period 1981/82 on our&#13;
estimates can be neglected, the possibility of future shortages cannot. Our&#13;
projections show dramatic yearly growth rates for expenditures on other food,&#13;
housing and daily articles. It is unclear whether these growth rates can be&#13;
matched by similar increases in supply.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

In this section we have analyzed interprovincial differences in&#13;
consumption patterns. We have shown that total income (or, more precisely,&#13;
total expenditure) levels explain a large part of the observed interprovincial&#13;
variation in per capita consumption. We have presented projections based on&#13;
income and population growth scenarios for the year 1990 and 2000.    We also&#13;
addressed the reliability of these projections, by briefly discussing various&#13;
sources of uncertainty.&#13;
In the next section we will repeat part of these analyses, using a&#13;
data set of a somewhat different nature. In Section 5 we will summarize our&#13;
results, discuss "best guess"* scenarios of future developments in consumer&#13;
demand for each commodity, and make suggestions for further research.&#13;

4. A Complete Model of Household Consumer Demand: ELES&#13;
4.1 Household Consumption Behavior&#13;
In the previous sections we presented various regression results&#13;
regarding the relationship between expenditure on a particular commodity and&#13;
total consumer expenditures.- We did so without making explicit reference to&#13;
any formal model of consumer behavior. In some cases, however, the regression&#13;
results can be given two interpretations. First, we can view them as&#13;
statistical relationships without a behavioral context. Second, we can view&#13;
them as behavioral equations stemming from a particular representation of&#13;
household consumption behavior.&#13;
In general such a representation states that households, in choosing&#13;
the combination of goods they want to consume, maximize their welfare given&#13;
their total budget. More specifically, households are supposed to maximize a&#13;
utility function, U, defined over a vector of consumption goods,&#13;
x = (xl, x2, ... xK) , subject to a budget constraint. Thus, the&#13;
maximization problem reads:&#13;
max U = U(xl, x2, *-- xK&#13;
x&#13;
K&#13;
subject to  I  P.X.    C&#13;
.i=1&#13;
with xi, quantity of good i,&#13;
Pi, price of good i,&#13;
C, total consumption expenditures.&#13;
1/ In the previous section "total consumer expenditures" was called "income"&#13;
for short. In what follows we will make a clear distinction between the&#13;
two;, in general, income will not be equal to total consumer expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
The resulting demand equations look like&#13;
=i xi(p 19      * - PK' C)        i = 1, K&#13;
i.e., the optimal demand for good i, xi, is a function of all prices and the&#13;
total budget, C.&#13;
If we assume that all households face the same prices, as is usually&#13;
the case in a cross-section sample, the demand functions can be reduced to&#13;
x.   x(C)        i = 1, K&#13;
1    1&#13;
i.e., the optimal demand for good i, xi, is a function of C only. Note that&#13;
the difference between the statistical interpretation on the one hand, and the&#13;
behavioral interpretation on the other hand, relates to the fact that in the&#13;
latter case observed demand patterns are interpreted as optimal demand&#13;
patterns, from the point of view of the utility maximizing household.,&#13;
Different choices for the (unobservable) utility function U will&#13;
result in different functional forms of the demand functions. In the previous&#13;
sections we saw examples of various specifications of these so-called Engel&#13;
curves. Some of the examples can be interpreted as consistent with a&#13;
particular representation of household behavior. For example, the linear&#13;
Engel curves can be viewed as being derived from the Linear Expenditure&#13;
System, while the share-log form can be derived from the Almost Ideal Demand&#13;
System. /&#13;
1/ See, for example, A. Deaton and J. Muellbauer, Economics and Consumer&#13;
Behavior, Cambridge University Press, 1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
In this section we will very explicitly interpret demand equations as&#13;
being derived from a particular representation of consumer behavior. By doing&#13;
so we will, for the time being, ignore the possibility that supply factors&#13;
(such as shortages) have influenced the observed consumption patterns. As we&#13;
will see below, the strong assumptions we will make regarding consumer&#13;
preferences, will allow us not only to obtain income effects, but price&#13;
effects as well.&#13;
4.2 The Extended Linear Expenditure System (ELES)&#13;
The best known and most widely used complete consumer demand system&#13;
is the Linear Expenditure System. It is derived as follows:&#13;
Assume that households maximize the following utility function:&#13;
K&#13;
U =      6Ein (xi   Yi&#13;
i.e., welfare, U, derived from consuming the commodities xl, x2, ..., XK, is a&#13;
weighted sum of the logarithm of all these commodities, to the extent that the&#13;
quantities consumed exceed a given minimum quantity yi.&#13;
It can be shown that maximization of this function subject to the&#13;
budget constraint&#13;
K&#13;
Pi p.xi = C&#13;
x. C&#13;
yields the following demand equations,&#13;
K&#13;
Pi i   PiYi + Bi(c -   E pjyt)    i = 1, K&#13;
or&#13;
K&#13;
xi = yi + (.i/pj)(c -      i iy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
in other words: for all commodities, a household first.buys the minimum quan-&#13;
K                   K&#13;
tity iE y. (which costs   I  p.y.)   After that, it splits the rest of its&#13;
i=1      K          i=   '&#13;
budget, (C -  I   P.Y.),  in proportions B.. The minimum quantity yi is often&#13;
j=1  J &#13;
referred to as the subsistence level of good i.&#13;
Note that when all prices are equal for all consumers, we can write&#13;
the demand equations as&#13;
K&#13;
xi = Yi+    i(C -  E yj)&#13;
K&#13;
or                           i   (Yi   Bi     yj) + B   C&#13;
*j=l       1&#13;
or                          x. = a. + 8. C&#13;
1    1    1&#13;
K&#13;
with                -        i   (y   8. i  y.)&#13;
Thus the linear Engel curves estimated in the previous sections can be&#13;
interpreted as being derived from this consumer demand model (which is known&#13;
as the Linear Expenditure System, LES).&#13;
Lluch (1973) has extended this one-period model to a multi-period&#13;
model, the demand equations of which read:&#13;
K&#13;
Xi =Yi + (si/Pi)(Y     jX   i i&#13;
j=1 &#13;
or, in the absence of price differences&#13;
K&#13;
X  = Yi+ 8.(Y -    I  y.)&#13;
or                          x. = a. + B.Y&#13;
1.   1    1&#13;
K&#13;
with                        a. i  Yi -8   I     &#13;
j=1 &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
Thus, for estimation purposes, the only difference between the LES&#13;
and the extended LES, ELES, is the fact that in the first case total consumer&#13;
expenditures, C, enters the right-hand side of the equation.     In the second&#13;
case, total income, Y, is the explanatory variable.     The difference between Y&#13;
and C is, of course, equal to savings or dissavings.&#13;
In the next sections we will present estimates of ELES demand&#13;
functions:&#13;
Xi =ci. + 8.Y         i = 1, K.&#13;
11         1&#13;
From these estimates we will calculate the subsistence levels yi . We will&#13;
then show how we can calculate price effects, once estimates of ail ai's and&#13;
Yiis have been obtained. But first we will discuss the data.&#13;
4.3 The Data&#13;
The data used for this part of the analyses stem from Hubei province&#13;
and Beijing municipalities.   All data for Hubei relate to peasants.     For&#13;
Beijing the data are for staff and workers in the urban part of the Beijing&#13;
municipality.&#13;
For Hubei the data is available for 1981 and 1982. For seven per&#13;
capita income classes, detailed information is available on household&#13;
consumption expenditures. The main difference with data from the previous&#13;
section is that in addition to total consumption expenditures, average total&#13;
income is known for each income group. That allows us to estimate the ELES&#13;
demand equations and, subsequently. to calculate income and price elasticities.&#13;
For Beijing, the same data is available for 1982.1!&#13;
1/ The Beijing data give nine income classes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
Tables 4lA, 4.1B, and 4.1C give summary statistics on consumption&#13;
patterns.&#13;
Per capita consumption expenditures for Hubei 1981 totalled 234.36&#13;
yuan, or 72 percent of total income. As in the previous sections the food&#13;
share is the largest, 64 percent (the province data showed an average of 60&#13;
percent). Clothing takes 13 percent of the budget (the provincial average was&#13;
12 percent), followed by daily articles, 9 percent; housing, 7 percent; and&#13;
fuel, 6 percent.l/ Note once again that the category housing, for peasants,&#13;
consists mainly of expenditures on building materials.&#13;
Hubei 1982 shows slightly lower income and expenditure levels but&#13;
approximately the same budget shares (housing somewhat higher, clothing&#13;
lower).21&#13;
For Beijing, the breakdown of the total budget into individual&#13;
components is somewhat different. The categories for food and clothing&#13;
coincide with those for Hubei. Note that the budget share for food is still&#13;
very large, in spite of the fact that total income and total expenditures in&#13;
Beijing exceed those in Hubei by a wide margin. This apparent contradiction&#13;
to Engel's Law is explained by the fact that the Beijing data relate to an&#13;
urban area, with higher food prices and zero consumption of home grown&#13;
produce.&#13;
1/  Provincial averages were 10, 10 and 5, respectively.&#13;
2/ The summary statistics presented in this section are unweighted averages&#13;
over the seven income classes. Weighted averages show the total income&#13;
and expenditure levels of 1982 to exceed those of 1981.&#13;

The category housing is replaced by the category "non-commodities",&#13;
which includes rents. However rents is only 21 percent of this category, and&#13;
so it constitutes less than 2 percent of the total budget. This reflects the&#13;
high subsidies for housing for staff and workers in urban areas. As also&#13;
shown in Table 4.1.D, transportation cost accounts for 24 percent of the group&#13;
of non-commodities, while water and electricity together, account for 12&#13;
percent. Other items include tuition, expenditures on nurseries and&#13;
kindergarten and repairs. These are all items that have virtually zero&#13;
expenditures in rural areas.&#13;

4.4 Estimation Results&#13;
For each of the three samples we estimated the following set of&#13;
equations:&#13;
x. =  . + S. Y      i =1, K&#13;
1    1    1&#13;
with xi, consumption of good i,&#13;
Y, total income.&#13;
The coefficient 8i is the marginal propensity to consume item i out&#13;
of total income. The sum of all B.'s is the overall marginal propensity to&#13;
consume, u, i.e.:&#13;
K&#13;
..          p~~~1 =  E8.&#13;
i=l1&#13;
Obviously, (1- uY is the marginal propensity to save.&#13;
Table 4.2 gives the estimation results for Bi. 1/&#13;
We first note that the marginal propensity to consume declined&#13;
slightly in Hubei, from 0.693 in 1981 to 0.652 in 1982. Thus the rural data&#13;
imply the very high marginal savings rates of 0.307 and 0.348, respectively.&#13;
For Beijing, the marginal savings rate is 0.173.2/&#13;
In all cases food has the highest marginal share, especially for&#13;
Beijing where 44 fen out of every additional yuan is being spent on food.&#13;
The results for Hubei 1981 and Hubei 1982 do show some variation,&#13;
which is probably due to data problems regarding income and housing for Hubei&#13;
1982. We therefore decided to base our subsequent analyses on the data for&#13;
Hubei 1981 only.&#13;
1/ Complete estimation results of the demand equation are given in Annex 5.&#13;
2/ One source of this urban-rural difference in the marginal savings rate is&#13;
that rural income is gross of expenditures on sideline activities. A net&#13;
income figure would be 8-10 percent lower.&#13;

Taking the "subsistence level" interpretation of the parameters&#13;
Yi literally, we find that this level for total consumption in Hubei is 74.29&#13;
yuan in 1981.. For Beijing the comparable yearly level is 200.40 yuan.&#13;
For Hubei, over 80 percent of subsistence expenditures is for food,&#13;
10 percent is for housing, and the rest for fuel and clothing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
For Beijing we find that:   68 percent of subsistence expenditures is&#13;
for total food, while slightly less than half of this is for grain.     Monthly&#13;
per capita subsistence expenditures on clothing, fuel and daily articles are&#13;
very low.  The y-coefficient for non-commodities which includes rent, equals&#13;
1.84 yuan per capita.&#13;
We will now use the estimated a coefficients (Table 4.2) and the&#13;
calculated y-coefficients (Table 4.3) to calculate income and price&#13;
elasticities for all goods.&#13;
4.5 Income Elasticities-&#13;
Recall that the demand equations estimated in Section 4.4 can be&#13;
interpreted as stemming from the Extended Linear Expenditure System. The&#13;
general form of a demand equation in that system is:&#13;
K&#13;
pixi =piYi + Bi(Y -    I  pjy.)&#13;
j=l &#13;
For this demand equation" it can be shown that the income elasticity is equal&#13;
to:&#13;
ax    y=&#13;
The own price elasticity equals:&#13;
nii [=(1 -    i) yi/xi] - 1&#13;
The cross price elasticity equals:&#13;
1/ Note, that no observations are available on prices, and all households are&#13;
assumed to face the same prices. Consequently all prices can be set equal&#13;
to 1.0 without loss of generality. For details on calculating the&#13;
elasticities, see Lluch et al. (1977).&#13;

Income elasticities and elasticities with respect to total expen-&#13;
ditures are presented in Table 4.4.   For ease of comparison with Section 3, we&#13;
will restrict ourselves to discussing the latter to, facilitate comparison&#13;
with the previous section.&#13;
With two exceptions, the results show a relatively-stable pattern.&#13;
As expected, food is a necessity with an income elasticity ranging from 0.834&#13;
in Hubei to 0.891 in Beijing. Based on the province data we found a range of&#13;
0.759 to 0.802&#13;

(Table 3.3). The very low elasticity for staple food also confirms our&#13;
previous findings, though the value of 0.117 is only half of what we found in&#13;
the previous section. The urban nature of the Beijing sample may explain part&#13;
of this difference.&#13;
Clothing, turns out to be a luxury .in these samples, while the&#13;
province data implied an income elasticity of about 0.70. Thus if the results&#13;
from the Beijing and Hubei surveys are to be believed, we significantly under-&#13;
estimated the growth rate of clothing expenditures in the previous section.&#13;
Daily articles show an elasticity of about 1.45, which is close to&#13;
the result presented in Table 3.3 (1.328).&#13;
The results for fuel are quite surprising, an expenditure elasticity&#13;
of 1.035 in Hubei, and only 0.305 in Beijing. Perhaps that urban/rural&#13;
differences in the distribution of fuel (mainly coal) are responsible for -this&#13;
large difference.&#13;
The largest difference between the province data and the results from&#13;
the current data sets is for housing. For Hubei we find an elasticity of&#13;
0.800, while. the province data yield 2.692. Clearly more detailed information&#13;
on housing expenditures is needed to obtain more reliable results.&#13;
In Table 4.5 we present total expenditure elasticities as presented&#13;
by Lluch et al. The elasticities are average values of studies in 16&#13;
countries, all based on the Extended Linear Expenditure System. The averages&#13;
are given by income class.'/&#13;

this study.&#13;

Our results for food are well within the range presented by Lluch et&#13;
al. The elasticities for clothing calculated from the Hubei and Beijing&#13;
samples seem quite high compared to Table 4.5, but the province data yield an&#13;
elasticity for clothing which is slightly less than the lowest value presented&#13;
by Lluch et al.&#13;
The Hubei data show an expenditure elasticity for housing of 0.800.&#13;
Lluch et al. show a relatively narrow range from 0.68 to 1.24, so our result&#13;
seems quite plausible. However, we should note again the high elasticity&#13;
implied by the province data, which is well outside this range.&#13;
To the extent that "Daily Articles" and "Durables" refer to&#13;
approximately the same commodities, our results are very close to the overall&#13;
average of 1.58. No direct comparisons can be made for fuel. In sum, to the&#13;
extent that international comparisons can be used as a guide to judge the&#13;
plausibility of our results, we do not find any strong suggestions that the&#13;
results for China are very different from those of other countries, with the&#13;
exception of housing.&#13;

We see a relatively stable pattern. *The price elasticity for food is&#13;
quite high (in absolute value). As we can see for Beijing 1982, this is&#13;
mainly due to a large price elasticity for the luxury food items. Staple food&#13;
(grain) shows a price elasticity of only -0.080. An international comparison&#13;
shows that our results exceed all values reported by Lluch et al., (see Table&#13;
4.8).&#13;
For clothing we find also fairly large elasticities, within a narrow&#13;
range, -0.942 to -0.977. The overall average for other countries is only&#13;
-0.46. The same for daily articles: very stable results, but fairly large&#13;
elasticities as compared to other countries. The own price elasticities for&#13;
fuel and housing seem to be quite different in urban and rural areas.&#13;
In general, we find own-price elasticities that exceed those in other&#13;
countries, but the results seem quite plausible and, with few exceptions, are&#13;
relatively stable across the two samples.&#13;
We also calculated cross-price elasticities for all commodities.&#13;
With the exception of the cross-elasticities with respect to the food price,&#13;
all cross-price elasticities turned out to be less than 0.05. We therefore&#13;
present the cross elasticities for the food price only (Table 4.9).&#13;
While the own-price elasticities turned out to be rather large, as&#13;
compared to other countries, the cross-price elasticities lie below&#13;
international averages (compare to Table 4.10). However, the results still&#13;
indicate that an increase in the food price (relative to the price of all&#13;
other commodities) may significantly reduce the demand for clothing, daily&#13;
articles and, to a lesser extent, housing.&#13;

4.7  Food Price Effects:   An Example&#13;
In Section 3 we presented demand projections based on income changes&#13;
only.  In Table 4.11 we show what happens when the food price increases,&#13;
relative to all other prices. The results are based on the Beijing 1982&#13;
data. The first column gives increases in per capita consumption, due to&#13;
income growth as projected in the medium growth scenario. The results&#13;
indicate a 101 percent increase in per capita consumption.&#13;
The first price scenario we simulated, assumes a ten percent increase&#13;
of the food price, relative to all other prices, in 1990. And a 20 percent&#13;
increase in the year 2000. As a result the quantity of food consumed per&#13;
capita shows only a 20 percent increase in 1990 (instead of 32 percent as&#13;
projected under the constant price scenario), and an 72 percent increase in&#13;
2000 (instead of 101 percent). Expenditures on food rise 28 percent and 106&#13;
percent, respectively.&#13;
The last two columns show the effect of a 20 percent food price&#13;
increase in 1990 and a 40 percent increase in 2000. The results clearly&#13;
indicate the large price effect on the quantity consumed. The effect on&#13;
expenditures is much less, as of course can be expected.&#13;
In the next section we will summarize our results and make&#13;
suggestions for further research.&#13;

5. Summary and Conclusion&#13;
In this study we analyzed a limited number of data on consumption in&#13;
China, and used the results to give indications about plausible developments&#13;
in consumption patterns iesulting from continuing economic growth.    In this&#13;
section we will summarize our results and qualify them where necessary.&#13;
Food&#13;
The budget share for food is very high in China, which indicates a&#13;
relatively low level of economic well-being. The share will decrease, but&#13;
food will continue to be the largest item in the budget of an average peasant&#13;
household. Based on the medium growth income scenario, and a 17.8 percent&#13;
increase in population between 1982 and 2000, food consumption will grow at a&#13;
rate of 4.12 percent per year.   This projection uses the results from the&#13;
province data. Additional information from the Hubei and Beijing samples does&#13;
not suggest any major modifications.&#13;
_    The composition of the food budget will change significantly.    Total&#13;
consumption of staple food will grow a modest 1 percent per year, non-staple&#13;
food 5.57 percent and other food items 9.30 percent. Some of the results&#13;
indicate that these projections overestimate the demand growth for non-staple&#13;
food, but underestimate the growth in other food consumption.&#13;
Clothing&#13;
Based on the province data we project a yearly growth rate of just&#13;
pver four percent for the demand for clothes. The Hubei and Beijing samples&#13;
suggest that this projections may be too low. If the income elasticity of&#13;
clothing is indeed, closer to 1.3 (Hubei and Beijing samples) than to 0.7&#13;
(province data) the yearly growth rate maybe closer to seven percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
Fuel&#13;
We project that fuel consumption will grow less than three percent&#13;
annually. Fuel in rural China consists mainly of wood and plant stalks for&#13;
cooking purposes. It seems plausible that the demand for fuel for heating and&#13;
light will start to rise due to better (larger) housing facilities. Also'the&#13;
demand for fuel for transportation may increase. These items are negligible&#13;
in the current data.&#13;
For Beijing we find an income elasticity for electricity of 0.871,&#13;
and for transportation of 1.073. Both results suggest that the demand for:&#13;
fuel in rural China may grow,much faster than now projected, once electricitj&#13;
and vehicles become more commonly available.&#13;
Housing&#13;
In rural China, housing expenditures are for building material. We&#13;
seem to witness a transition from mud houses to brick houses.     And this&#13;
transition has a very steep income gradient. Consequently we project a very&#13;
large growth rate, 9.21 percent per year. Indeed the data seem to indic'ate'&#13;
that this growth rate may even be too low.&#13;
If the current building activities are eliminating shortages of the&#13;
past, one can expect a flattening out of the demand curve once reasonable&#13;
housing conditions have been obtained. The data currently available do'not'&#13;
show such a trend. More detailed data for households at higher income levels&#13;
are needed, to improve on the housing projections.&#13;
The Beijing data show a modest income elasticity for rent:     0.535.-'-"&#13;
This probably reflects/the fact that housing subsidies are a normal par't df i&#13;
the total compensation package for staff and workers in urban areas. This job'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
related rationing mechanism is likely to bias the income effect downward.&#13;
Consequently this low income elasticity may severely underestimate the future&#13;
(latent) demand for housing.&#13;
Daily Articles&#13;
Perhaps the most interesting category of consumption goods is that of&#13;
daily articles. We project a yearly growth rate of 6.17 percent. However, we&#13;
would not be surprised if this turns out to be far too low. A major problem&#13;
with the current study is that we implicitly assume that the observed demand&#13;
patterns reflect the choice of the household. However, supply factors may&#13;
also have played a role. The next step in the analysis of consumption in&#13;
China should take a closer look at these supply factors. Shortages are likely&#13;
to occur in various consumer goods. In a follow-up study we will take a more&#13;
detailed look at the category daily articles. We will then try to make an&#13;
assessment on how shortages of various goods, especially of such durables as&#13;
television sets or bicycles, may have influenced observed consumption&#13;
patterns.&#13;
General&#13;
In this paper we have almost completely ignored one potential source&#13;
of information that can be used as a base for projecting China's future house-&#13;
hold consumption patterns: international comparisons. This omission allowed&#13;
us to. ignore the major problem-of comparing relative prices across&#13;
countries. Nevertheless, given the scarcity of information on past and&#13;
current consumption patterns in China, international comparisons may yield&#13;
useful insights into China's likely development. In a follow-up study we will&#13;
attempt to deal with this issue.&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
Cash versus total expenditures&#13;
In order to see how sensitive our results are to the particular way&#13;
in which consumption has been measured, we re-estimated the linear Engel&#13;
curves for food and fuel, using cash expenditures on these items as the&#13;
dependent variable and total cash expenditures as the independent one. The&#13;
results for food are illustrated in Figure 5, for 1981.&#13;
These results are consistent with the following simple model:&#13;
(x  + xK) =al +    (Y   xK)&#13;
where xC is cash expenditure,&#13;
XK is value of consumer goods received in-kind,&#13;
y  is cash income;&#13;
i.e., we assume that everyone receives the same quantity (on a per capita&#13;
base) of food.-/&#13;
The value of this quantity, xK, is added to both cash consumption and&#13;
cash income to obtain total consumption and income measures.&#13;
This equation, of course, can be written as:&#13;
x = (l + aY&#13;
1/ This need not be the case. For instance in-kind distribution of food and&#13;
fuel may be a function of cash income.&#13;

where x =      + XK,&#13;
Y   ycc   YK&#13;
We have estimated this equation in the previous section. Subtracting&#13;
XK from both sides, yields&#13;
Xc   a2 +Yc&#13;
where a2 =1 +             x)  K&#13;
Note that if this simple model is correct, the estimate for 8 in this&#13;
equation should be equal to the a in the previous equation. This seems to be&#13;
the case: the two regressions yield parallel Engel curves.&#13;
Since similar results were obtained for fuel, we conclude that the&#13;
fact that consumption includes both cash expenditures and in-kind items, does&#13;
not seem to have biased our results.&#13;

            Private household consumption in China : a
            study of people's livelihood
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Until recently data on the economy of
            China has been scarce. In this paper we take a first look at
            private household consumption in China, using data for 1981
            and 1982 published in the Statistical Yearbooks of China. We
            first show current consumption patterns, make some simple
            extrapolations for the period 1983-2000 based on various
            growth scenarios, and then estimate the Extended Linear
            Expenditure System (ELES) for China. Income, own-price and
            cross-price elasticities are also presented. The analyses
            are preceded by historical data for the period 1949-1979.
