DEFINITIONS&#13;
Acid Fast Bacilli:              Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis, unlike other&#13;
bacteria, cannot readily be stained by the Gram stain&#13;
method. A harsh staining procedure is required.&#13;
Carbol-fuchsin, a red dye, is taken up and retained&#13;
after washing in an acid-alcohol solution. Thus, the&#13;
bacteria of this genus are referred to as Acid Fast&#13;
Bacilli.&#13;
Annual Risk of Infection:       The annual risk of infection tells us the probability&#13;
that any individual will be infected or re-infected in&#13;
one year with M. tuberculosis, causative agent of&#13;
human tuberculosis derived from human sources.&#13;
The annual risk of infection has become the&#13;
standard indicator of the tuberculosis burden in a&#13;
community.&#13;
BCG:                            An attenuated strain of M. bovis (or bovine type M.&#13;
tuberculosis). Drs. Albert Calmette and Camille&#13;
Guerin started making subcultures every three&#13;
weeks of the virulent organism in 1906 in Lille,&#13;
France. Twelve years later in 1918 the attenuated&#13;
strain was isolated. It was first used as a vaccine in&#13;
1921.&#13;
Case Detection:                 There are two types of case detection, active and&#13;
passive. Active Case Detection refers to&#13;
community activities in which the tuberculosis&#13;
health services are actively search for new TB cases&#13;
through screening examinations (radiographic or&#13;
Passive Case Detection refers to community&#13;
activities in which the public health and medical&#13;
services, including the regularly constituted&#13;
tuberculosis control staff, detect new TB cases&#13;
among the population who present themselves with&#13;
symptomatic complaints.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv -&#13;
DALYs:                         Disability Adjusted Life Years. DALYs represent&#13;
the sum of years lost both from premature death and&#13;
from disability associated with disease and injury.&#13;
Directly Observed Treatment (DOT): An anti-tuberculosis drug treatment which is taken&#13;
in the presence of, and is directly observed by a&#13;
health care worker or other trained person, and is&#13;
duly recorded in the patient's treatment card.&#13;
DOTS Strategy:                 The WHO strategy or DOTS--directly-observed&#13;
treatment, short-course--is designed to make a&#13;
significant impact in slowing down the TB cycle of&#13;
infection. The major technical features of the&#13;
strategy are: (a) targeting the infectious TB sub-&#13;
group of smear-positive individuals through passive&#13;
case finding; (b) using sputum examination for&#13;
diagnosis and treatment evaluation; (c) prescribing a&#13;
six- to eight-month, multi-drug, SCC treatment&#13;
regimen; (d) applying directly observed Treatment&#13;
(DOT) in case management; and (e) emphasizing&#13;
treatment completion and cure of TB patients and&#13;
cohort analysis of results through simple registers at&#13;
the sub-district level.&#13;
Epidemiology:                  The study of the distribution and determinants of&#13;
diseases and injuries in human populations. It is&#13;
concerned with the frequencies and types of&#13;
illnesses and injuries in groups of people and with&#13;
the factors that influence their distribution.&#13;
Incidence:                     Number of new cases of a disease or condition over&#13;
a period of time as a proportion of the population at&#13;
risk at midpoint. Incidence means "new" and is a&#13;
direct indicator of risk.&#13;
Long-Course Chemotherapy (LCC): Drug treatment for tuberculosis, recommended by&#13;
the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert&#13;
Committee on Tuberculosis in 1974. It's a&#13;
chemotherapy regimen that is administered for&#13;
twelve to eighteen months and uses fewer and&#13;
cheaper drugs, such as, isoniazid, streptomycin and&#13;
thiacetazone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- v -&#13;
Prevalence:                     Number of cases of a disease or condition at a given&#13;
point in time as a proportion of the total population.&#13;
Prevalence means "all" and is used by health&#13;
planners to assess workload and service delivery&#13;
needs.&#13;
Revised National Tuberculosis   The new approach for the National Tuberculosis&#13;
Control Program (RNTP):         Control Program adopted by the Ministry of Health&#13;
and Family Welfare in 1992. Its primary features&#13;
include: (a) strengthening and reorganizing the&#13;
Central TB Control unit; (b) adopting new and more&#13;
rigorous methods for diagnosis, treatment and&#13;
monitoring of patients, with emphasis on their cure;&#13;
(c) decentralizing service delivery to the periphery;&#13;
(d) strengthening training and research capacity; (e)&#13;
targeting infectious, smear-positive cases; (f)&#13;
providing SCC with DOT treatment; and (g)&#13;
introducing a rigorous system of patient recording&#13;
and monitoring through patient registration books&#13;
and treatment cards.&#13;
Short-Course Chemotherapy (SCC): Tuberculosis treatment that lasts from six to eight&#13;
months, using multiple and more potent drugs, such&#13;
as, isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and&#13;
pyrazinamide. Short-Course Chemotherapy&#13;
converts most patients to smear negative faster than&#13;
the long course chemotherapy and more effectively&#13;
due to higher cure rates and higher compliance. It&#13;
leads to a more rapid reduction in the risk of&#13;
infection and incidence of clinical tuberculosis.&#13;
Smear-Negative Patient:         A tuberculosis patient with radiographic&#13;
abnormalities consistent with active pulmonary&#13;
tuberculosis, at least three negative sputum&#13;
specimen, (for the Acid Fast Bacilli) and decision&#13;
by a physician to treat with a full curative course of&#13;
anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy.&#13;
Smear-Positive Patient:         A tuberculosis patient with two sputum specimen&#13;
positive for the AFB, or with one sputum specimen&#13;
positive for the AFB and radiographic abnormalities&#13;
consistent with active pulmonary tuberculosis.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
PROPOSED TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:         India, acting by its President&#13;
Beneficiaries:     A total of 102 districts under the Revised Strategy for Tuberculosis&#13;
control (RNTP) and 357 districts under a strengthened National&#13;
Tuberculosis Control program throughout India.&#13;
Amount:            SDR 98.4 million (US$142.4 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:             Standard, with 35 years maturity.&#13;
On-Lending Terms: Government of India to all the States and Union Territories in&#13;
accordance with standard arrangements for development assistance&#13;
to the States of India.&#13;
Description:       The project would constitute a time-slice financing of the National&#13;
TB Control Program over five years with the purpose of setting up&#13;
the institutional and managerial infrastructure to establish the&#13;
Revised Strategy for Tuberculosis Control (RNTP) on a larger&#13;
scale, and to facilitate its gradual expansion to the entire country&#13;
within an 8-12 year time frame. The major features of the RNTP&#13;
strategy which differentiates it from the current National Program&#13;
include: (a) a focus on patient diagnosis based on sputum analysis&#13;
rather than X-ray; (b) emphasis on cure of infectious or smear-&#13;
positive patients through passive case finding to reduce the risk of&#13;
infection; (c) administration of short-course treatment under&#13;
directly-observed therapy (DOTS) to prevent development of drug&#13;
resistance and ensure patient adherence to treatment; (d) a rigorous&#13;
system of patient registration, monitoring and follow up to ensure&#13;
high cure rates; and (e) decentralized service delivery to the&#13;
periphery to facilitate access for the poor.&#13;
The project would involve: (a) gradual implementation of the&#13;
Revised Strategy for TB control (RNTP) in 102 districts, (b)&#13;
strengthening of the National TB Program (NTP) in 203 short-&#13;
course chemotherapy districts (SCC) as a transitional step to adopt&#13;
the RNTP, and (c) strengthening of conventional treatment in the&#13;
remaining non-SCC districts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- x -&#13;
The project has been designed on the basis of the lessons learned&#13;
from two sets of pilot projects implemented during the past two&#13;
years to test the feasibility of a revised strategy for Tuberculosis&#13;
control in India. The foundations built through the pilots and the&#13;
inputs associated with their implementation provide a sound basis&#13;
for the proposed project and have resulted in increased interest in&#13;
TB control in India.&#13;
The project components include: (a) improving the quality of care&#13;
and access to TB Control services through new strategies, policies,&#13;
technical and operational guidelines; improved drug procurement&#13;
storage and distribution, and rigorous supervision and monitoring;&#13;
(b) developing institutional and operational research capacity and&#13;
enhancing technical and managerial skills by strengthening the&#13;
National and State Tuberculosis Demonstration and Training&#13;
Centers, strengthening the Central, State and District TB units,&#13;
establishing an appropriate management information system,&#13;
identifying and carrying out priority operational research and&#13;
upgrading the skills of relevant health personnel and program&#13;
managers; and (c) developing information, communication and&#13;
outreach activities and promoting community involvement by&#13;
implementing a new communication strategy that focuses primarily&#13;
on improved interpersonal skills between providers and patients,&#13;
outreach to the private sector and active involvement of NGOs for&#13;
community participation.&#13;
The project's goal is to reduce preventable mortality and morbidity&#13;
due to Tuberculosis (TB) by preventing the increase of infectious&#13;
TB, the annual risk of infection and the development of drug&#13;
resistance. Specifically, the project would: (a) diagnose and treat a&#13;
minimum of 1.9 million TB cases including more than 800,000&#13;
smear-positive and severe TB cases; and (b) achieve cure rates of&#13;
at least 85% of newly-diagnosed smear-positive cases in the RNTP&#13;
districts, the rates achieved in the pilot sites; c) provide treatment&#13;
with daily short-course chemotherapy to 850,000 smear positive&#13;
patients in the SCC districts and prepare those districts to adopt the&#13;
revised strategy; (d) treat about 230,000 smear-positive patients&#13;
with conventional drugs in non-SCC districts; (e) improve&#13;
diagnosis to reach at least 50% smear-positive cases as a&#13;
percentage of total diagnosed cases in RNTP and SCC districts;&#13;
and (f) improve the system of patient registration and follow up to&#13;
allow monitoring of treatment completion and cure in the SCC&#13;
districts.&#13;

The proposed project would finance drug purchases, medical and&#13;
laboratory equipment and supplies, civil works, vehicles, office&#13;
equipment, communication and educational materials, management&#13;
information systems and equipment and supplies, professional&#13;
services, training materials, contractual and consulting services,&#13;
workshops, fellowships, operations research activities, operational&#13;
expenses, honoraria and salaries of incremental staff, on a&#13;
declining basis.&#13;
Benefits:             It is expected that by introducing a new paradigm for TB control,&#13;
the proposed project would begin to reverse the trend of several&#13;
years of sub-optimal results which has led to a continued high&#13;
incidence of TB as well as drug-resistant cases. It is estimated that&#13;
the project would treat about three million TB cases in five years&#13;
of which about 1.9 million cases would be treated under the&#13;
revised strategy, including 800,000 new smear-positive or&#13;
infectious cases. The risk of infection comes primarily from this&#13;
latter group. If the project objective of 85% cure rate is achieved, a&#13;
minimum of 1.5 million TB patients would be cured and many&#13;
more millions of non-infected individuals would potentially be&#13;
freed from the risk of TB infection and the development of TB&#13;
disease'. It is estimated that after the second year of the project,&#13;
India would be saving about 140,000 deaths from TB per year.&#13;
This is especially important considering that the TB burden&#13;
adversely impacts the most economically and socially productive&#13;
members of Indian society, the 15-44 year old age group.&#13;
Moreover, the changes introduced by the project are likely to&#13;
improve awareness about TB among the people and improve&#13;
detection and treatment among private physicians who play an&#13;
important role in TB care.&#13;
TB disproportionately impacts those of low socioeconomic status&#13;
by virtue of their poor living conditions and poor nutritional status.&#13;
The proposed project would benefit primarily the poor, particularly&#13;
the rural poor, the urban slum dwellers, and tribal populations by&#13;
providing them access to appropriate and effective TB care.&#13;
Risks and             Most of the common risks associated with PHR projects&#13;
Safeguards:           such as issues of procurement, late disbursement, inadequate&#13;

maintenance of equipment, and the software aspects have been&#13;
considerably minimized by the implementation experience and the&#13;
commitment gained through the pilot projects. Nonetheless, the&#13;
project presents other risks, most typically associated with TB&#13;
control and the introduction of a new technical paradigm. They&#13;
include:(a) the risk of significant variation between the estimated&#13;
number of cases and the actual cases due to the fact that firm&#13;
information on TB incidence in India is not available; (b) the&#13;
inherent risks of a shift in technological and behavioral practices,&#13;
particularly the difficulties of persuading providers and patients to&#13;
accept the practice of directly observed treatment and the rigorous&#13;
features of the DOTS strategy; (c) the risk of poorly administered&#13;
short-course chemotherapy drugs and of poor quality anti-TB&#13;
drugs which would increase the probabilities of developing drug&#13;
resistance; (d) the risk that the Central and State TB Cells would be&#13;
unable to provide the leadership and services required to ensure&#13;
proper implementation of the program given the scope, the&#13;
managerial complexity of the revised strategy, and the need to&#13;
maintain an active constituency for TB control in the government&#13;
and the community; (e) the risk of an uneven supply of drugs in&#13;
light of the spotty record of drug deliveries in India combined with&#13;
the availability of large quantities of drugs which could be&#13;
misused; (f) the risk that the project would not succeed in&#13;
influencing the private providers in changing their TB practices;&#13;
and (g) the continuous challenge of dealing with mobile migrant&#13;
populations, particularly in urban slum settings.&#13;
The estimates of TB incidence in India are based on the best&#13;
information available at present; however, to ensure greater&#13;
accuracy on the quantitative objectives, the mid-term review would&#13;
be used to make a readjustment of the project objectives, as&#13;
needed, based on the actual experience of the project. This would&#13;
reduce the risk associated with possible inaccuracies on case&#13;
estimates; nonetheless, future incidence is likely to be affected by&#13;
the potential impact of HIV/AIDS.&#13;
The Phase I and II pilots implemented as part of project&#13;
preparation have helped to identify the risks associated with the&#13;
new approach and to find ways to mitigate them. They have also&#13;
provided the Central Unit in the Ministry of Health (MOH) with&#13;
hands-on experience on running the new program, understanding&#13;
the demands and constraints involved and having the opportunity&#13;
to make corrections as the project developed. Although the&#13;
Project's scope is large, the possibility of expanding the revised&#13;
strategy to a wider geographical area has generated enthusiasm and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xiii -&#13;
greater commitment among government officials, the medical&#13;
associations, and other groups. Similarly, the efforts to involve the&#13;
private sector and the NGOs are beginning to pay off.&#13;
The introduction of an appropriate Management Information&#13;
System (MIS) would help keep adequate control of registration and&#13;
patient records, including mobile populations. A decentralized&#13;
approach to treatment with the involvement of the community&#13;
would facilitate the implementation of DOT. Interruption in the&#13;
drug supply would be minimized through buffer stocks and&#13;
monitored through annual independent audits of the drug&#13;
inventory, distribution and utilization. Quality control of anti-TB&#13;
drugs would be monitored through independent scientific&#13;
institutions in addition to the standard government procedures.&#13;
The packaging of drugs in multi-drug blister packs and per-patient&#13;
treatment boxes, as well as the introduction of multi-drug&#13;
combination pills at a later stage would help reduce misuse of&#13;
medicines; and, the formal involvement of non-government sector&#13;
representatives in the coordinating bodies of the program and other&#13;
linkages with the sector would help promote the RNTP approach&#13;
among private practitioners.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
PROPOSED TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL PROJECT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A.   The Health Sector in India&#13;
1.1  India's health sector agenda of the past decade is based on the 1983 National&#13;
Health Policy which gives high priority to fertility control, infectious and endemic&#13;
diseases of public health significance and preventable causes of maternal and child&#13;
mortality and morbidity. Despite the focus on appropriate priorities, India's efforts to&#13;
implement its policies have been weakened due to various managerial and technical&#13;
reasons. Related to this, India's burden of disease accounts for over a fifth (21%) of the&#13;
global burden of disease. Communicable diseases take the greatest toll, accounting for&#13;
over half (51 %) of the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost. In addition, with a&#13;
growing population of more than 18 million per year and concurrent improvement of life&#13;
expectancy, India finds itself in the middle of a demographic and epidemiological&#13;
transition, facing a double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases&#13;
which take a special toll on the poor. In recent years, GOI has sought the support of the&#13;
World Bank's International Development Agency (IDA) to provide financial and&#13;
technical assistance in eliminating Leprosy, controlling HIV/AIDS, reducing the backlog&#13;
of Cataract Blindness, strengthening state health systems and promoting state health&#13;
reforms, and reducing mortality and more idity from tuberculosis and malaria.&#13;
1.2  In this context, the proposed Tuberculosis Control Project would help advance&#13;
India's health agenda and meet the long-term goal of helping reduce the incidence of&#13;
infectious and drug-resistant tuberculosis. The proposed project would be fully&#13;
consistent with the Government's stated objectives of improving the delivery of health&#13;
and family welfare services to the poor through the established health system. It would&#13;
also support GOI's policies and objectives for major disease control, which include: use&#13;
of appropriate technology; enforcement of appropriate standards of care; improved&#13;
quality of service delivery through increased emphasis on training, retraining, and non-&#13;
salary inputs; active participation of the private sector and NGOs; strengthening the&#13;
capacity of the states and districts in program planning and implementation; and&#13;
involving the beneficiaries and the communities in their own health care.&#13;
B.    The Epidemiology of Tuberculosis&#13;
1.3   Approximately 2.9 million people die from tuberculosis each year worldwide;&#13;
about one fifth of them in India alone. The annual incidence of new cases of all forms of&#13;
tuberculosis is over eight million in the developing world. Resurgence of TB in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
developed world has put the disease back on the front page of the health agenda in cities&#13;
like New York, Baltimore and Chicago.&#13;
1.4   Tuberculosis is unique among the main disease killers of the developing world in&#13;
that it afflicts nearly all age groups. But the greatest burden of tuberculosis morbidity,&#13;
disability and mortality is concentrated in adults aged 15 to 59, the most economically&#13;
active and productive segment of society. It is estimated that 26% of all deaths in this&#13;
age group is due to tuberculosis. Studies have also shown that tuberculosis affects&#13;
disproportionately the lower socio-economic groups.&#13;
1.5   Tuberculosis is transmitted through inhalation of infectious mycobacteria-laden&#13;
particles emitted in coughs, sneezes or similar airborne mechanisms. Unlike other&#13;
diseases, such as measles, in which infection is usually followed by disease, only about&#13;
5% to 10% of those infected with the tuberculosis bacilli develops clinical disease. In&#13;
80% of such cases, clinical tuberculosis develops within two to five years of infection.&#13;
50% of infected adults who develop the disease are smear-positive; they are the source of&#13;
infection in the community. In the absence of adequate treatment, an untreated smear-&#13;
positive person might infect, on average, 10 to 14 persons per year.&#13;
1.6   Tuberculosis can be controlled with existing technology because the infectious&#13;
agent is almost exclusively in the tuberculosis person who can be quickly rendered non-&#13;
infectious. A five percent decrease in the annual risk of infection (ARI) would ensure&#13;
that the tuberculosis problem in a given community or country would be reduced by one&#13;
half about every fourteen years. However, inappropriate treatment of TB may lead to&#13;
continued TB infection ard the development of drug-resistant TB.&#13;
1.7   Tuberculosis is cured through multi-drug therapy regimens which include&#13;
combinations of the following drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol&#13;
and, in some cases, streptomycin, as a supplement. Different combinations are prescribed&#13;
for smear-positive, smear-negative and re-treatment cases. Treatment lasts between 6-8&#13;
months under short course chemotherapy (SCC), and 12-18 months under conventional&#13;
or long course chemotherapy (LCC). Annex 2 provides detailed information on the&#13;
chemotherapy regimens prescribed for the project under SCC as recommended by WHO.&#13;
1.8   Reducing tuberculosis becomes more pressing with the appearance of the&#13;
HIV/AIDS epidemic. The major effect of HIV infection has been to increase the rate of&#13;
progression to clinical disease in those already infected with tuberculosis because of the&#13;
weakness of the immune system which allows the bacteria to develop unchecked. The&#13;
epidemiological impact of HIV on tuberculosis results in:(a) the reactivation of latent&#13;
tuberculosis with a high fatality rate; (b) new infection and high rate of progression to&#13;
active tuberculosis with high death rates, and (c) tuberculosis transmission from these&#13;
dually infected individuals to the general population, especially in places where the&#13;
tuberculosis control program is inadequate. An increase in HIV/AIDS cases is likely to&#13;
result in an increase in TB incidence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
1.9   To arrest this increase in TB, a new strategy for TB control was developed by the&#13;
International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (IUATLD) and adopted by&#13;
WHO as the recommended strategy for TB control in the world. The strategy has two&#13;
goals: to cure the patient and to prevent transmission. The WHO strategy or DOTS--&#13;
directly observed treatment, short-course--is designed to respond swiftly to these&#13;
increased risks and make a significant impact in slowing down the TB cycle of infection.&#13;
The major technical features of the strategy are: (a) targeting the infectious TB sub-group&#13;
of smear-positive individuals through passive case finding; (b) using sputum examination&#13;
for diagnosis and treatment evaluation; (c) prescribing a six or eight month recommended&#13;
multi-drug, SCC treatment regimen; (d) applying directly observed treatment (DOT) in&#13;
case management; and (e) emphasizing treatment completion and cure of TB patients and&#13;
cohort analysis of results through simple registers at the sub-district level. In addition,&#13;
the strategy calls for political commitment, adequate financial resources and regular drug&#13;
supply. The proposed project would introduce the WHO strategy adapted to the Indian&#13;
context in selected districts and city corporations, and would promote a major shift in the&#13;
national strategy for TB control in India.&#13;
ll. TUBERCULOSIS IN INDIA&#13;
A.   The Current Situation&#13;
2.1   The burden of tuberculosis in India is staggering by any measure. Over 1.2&#13;
million TB cases are reported every year through the National Program and the annual&#13;
mortality rate is estimated at around 500,000. While prevalence rates have remained&#13;
stagnant at around 1.5% of the population, the number of new cases has been growing&#13;
steadily. It is estimated that about 1.0 million new smear-positive TB cases develop&#13;
every year. Without appropriate intervention, it is estimated that cumulative mortality&#13;
during this decade, leading up to the year 2000, could be as high as 5.0 million&#13;
tuberculosis deaths. It is estimated that up to 50% of the Indian population is infected&#13;
with tuberculosis. About 75% of the diagnosed cases occur between the ages of 15 and&#13;
45 years old. While two thirds of these cases are estimated to occur in males, TB, takes a&#13;
disproportionately larger toll among young females, with more than 50% of female cases&#13;
occurring before 34 years of age.&#13;
2.2   HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis. While the spread of HIV in India may be a recent&#13;
phenomenon, it is estimated that there could be 250,000 HIV-related TB cases annually&#13;
by the year 2000. Although they represent only a fraction of the cumulative cases of TB&#13;
between the years 1990 and 2000, they are a cause of concern since they will be added on&#13;
to the expected growth of TB incidence in the country. Increasing prevalence of the HIV&#13;
virus and AIDS, and the evidence of drug-resistant tuberculosis mean that, without a&#13;
reoriented and enhanced public TB control program, TB will pose an increasingly serious&#13;
public health hazard with a high economic burden for India for several decades to come.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
B.    The National Tuberculosis Control Program&#13;
2.3    Background. The National Tuberculosis Control Program (NTP) was initiated in&#13;
1962 as a decentralized program in which District TB Control Centers (DTCs) were&#13;
established to implement the NTP at the District level. In 1976, the NTP was included in&#13;
the Prime Minister's 20 Point Development Program.&#13;
2.4    At the central level, the NTP is managed by the technical arm of the Ministry of&#13;
Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), which is the Directorate General for Health&#13;
Services (DGHS). The Deputy Director General for TB is the technical program director,&#13;
and the Joint Secretary from the administrative arm of MOHFW looks after the financial&#13;
and administrative control of the NTP. The Program is supported by selected national&#13;
and state institutions, prominent among them being the National Tuberculosis Institute&#13;
(NTI), Bangalore, the Tuberculosis Research Center (TRC) in Madras and the Lala Ram&#13;
Swarup Institute of TB and Allied Diseases (LRS) in Delhi.&#13;
2.5    At the State level, the NTP has a similar dual structure with the Director of&#13;
Medical Services and the Director of National Programs being responsible for overseeing&#13;
implementation. Implementation responsibility, however, lies primarily with the State&#13;
TB Officer. At the state level, in all major states, the NTP is supported by 16 State TB&#13;
Demonstration and Training Centers (STDTCs) for training and research to help&#13;
supplement the work of the Central Training Institutions. However, until now these&#13;
centers have operated primarily as TB Centers for curative care in addition to providing&#13;
epidemiological data and monitoring the Program at the state level. Their role as training&#13;
institutions has been minimal.&#13;
2.6   At the District level, the District Tuberculosis Officer (DTO), under the direction&#13;
of the District Medical Officer and the District Public Health Officer, is responsible for&#13;
implementing the program through the general health care system.&#13;
2.7   The major objectives of the NTP are to: (a) diagnose as large a number of cases as&#13;
possible and provide efficient treatment, giving priority to smear-positive patients; and&#13;
(b) implement these activities as an integral part of the general health services.&#13;
2.8    Main Issues. Despite the program's objectives and the importance of the&#13;
tuberculosis problem, the NTP has been unable to make a significant impact in the&#13;
epidemiology of TB in India. Overall, the results of the Program have been&#13;
disappointing. One of the most significant problems has been the focus on case detection&#13;
which has distracted attention from the prime aim of TB control which is patient cure.&#13;
Other key factors constraining the effectiveness of NTP have been: (i) low political&#13;
commitment and serious lack of funds at the central and state levels; (ii) institutional and&#13;
managerial weakness due to insufficient trained staff, vacant posts and weak linkages&#13;
with the other TB services and the health system in the periphery; (iii) technical weakness&#13;
characterized by lack of rigor in the use of short-course chemotherapy (SCC) and reliance&#13;
on X-ray instead of sputum analysis for diagnosis; (iv) a proliferation of drug regimens;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
(v) a private sector which treats over 50% of new TB with an extraordinary variety of&#13;
ineffective and potentially harmful drug regimens; (vi) a lack of systematic training,&#13;
quality control and regular supply of drugs; (vii) lack of strategies to ensure the poor have&#13;
access to TB care and complete treatment; (viii) reluctance of service providers to give&#13;
adequate information to patients because of stigma and lack of good communication&#13;
skills; (ix) a poor recording and monitoring system; (x) lack of quality control of&#13;
laboratory results, and (xi) low cure rates.&#13;
2.9   At the same time, because of lack of resources, the NTP has continued to rely on&#13;
Long-Course Chemotherapy (LCC) treatment of either 12 or 18 months which&#13;
discourages patients from completing treatment. Although short-course chemotherapy&#13;
(SCC) has been introduced in almost two-thirds of the country's districts (292 out of 496&#13;
districts), drugs are often unavailable or treatment is administered without direct&#13;
observation and appropriate patient follow-up. The shortage of drugs, the lack of&#13;
adequate information available to doctors and patients, and the fact that pharmaceutical&#13;
companies advertise only the drugs they produce and not all the drugs needed for cure,&#13;
has led to a proliferation of treatment regimens. This, in turn, has led to low treatment&#13;
completion and cure rates and has raised considerably the risk of increased drug-resistant&#13;
TB. One of India's major problem with TB is the number of re-treatment cases resulting&#13;
from previous incomplete treatments.&#13;
2.10  Annex 3 provides a detailed description of the organization and functioning of the&#13;
NTP (including the RNTP) at the different levels with the modifications introduced by&#13;
the proposed project to correct the shortcomings described above.&#13;
2.11  Recent Efforts to Improve the NTP. Recognizing the shortcomings of the&#13;
National TB Program and the expected increase in the TB incidence, GOI, with support&#13;
from WHO and the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), undertook a&#13;
detailed program evaluation of the NTP in 1992.&#13;
2.12  The joint review called for a significant overhaul of the NTP and the adoption of a&#13;
new approach to TB control as advocated by WHO and proven successful in other&#13;
countries. It recommended: (a) strengthening and reorganizing the Central TB Control&#13;
unit; (b) adopting new and more rigorous methods for diagnosis, treatment and&#13;
monitoring of patients, with emphasis on their cure; (c) decentralizing service delivery to&#13;
the periphery; (d) strengthening training and research capacity; (e) targeting infectious,&#13;
smear-positive cases; (f) providing SCC with DOT treatment; and (g) introducing a&#13;
rigorous system of patient recording and monitoring through patient registration books&#13;
and treatment cards. This new approach, or the Revised National Tuberculosis Control&#13;
Program (RNTP), was adopted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in 1992.&#13;
Annex 4 provides further details on the findings of the joint GOI-WHO-SIDA review of&#13;
the NTP.&#13;
2.13  Pilot Activities. The logistical inputs, technical skills and quality of supervision&#13;
demanded by the RNTP required a carefully orchestrated management system which had&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
to be tested under real-life conditions in the Indian context. Similarly, the need to involve&#13;
key stakeholders called for a participatory approach in project design through pilot and&#13;
other participatory activities. The first set of five pilots (Phase 1) was initiated in 1993&#13;
with financing from SIDA and technical assistance from WHO. It tested and&#13;
demonstrated the technical feasibility of the RNTP in India. Sputum conversions and&#13;
patient cure using SCC with directly observed treatment (DOT) were achieved with high&#13;
success rates, compared to those obtained from the previous NTP.&#13;
2.14   However, while the Phase I pilots showed successful outcome in terms of patient&#13;
cure, it also pointed to numerous institutional and managerial weaknesses which had to&#13;
be addressed before a large scale intervention could be considered. Failures in timely&#13;
delivery of inputs, supervision and follow-up during Phase I raised questions about the&#13;
feasibility of program implementation in several states. This prompted the Government&#13;
of India to request financing for a second phase of pilots. A Project Preparation Facility&#13;
(PPF) advance was approved by the Bank on November 30, 1994 to initiate new pilot&#13;
sites in several more states and city corporations under a Phase II. Phase II was designed&#13;
to test the technical and managerial feasibility of implementing the revised strategy on a&#13;
larger scale, including the institutional capacity of the central, state and district authorities&#13;
to carry out the RNTP with the necessary rigor to ensure efficient and effective program&#13;
implementation.&#13;
2.15   The Government of India and the World Bank agreed that the findings of the two&#13;
sets of pilots (Phases I and II) would serve as the basis for considering World Bank&#13;
financing of the proposed Tuberculosis Control Project in a larger number of districts.&#13;
The findings of the IDA Pre-appraisal mission (January 22- February 9, 1996), which&#13;
reviewed the implementation of the pilots in Phases I and II, confirmed that the revised&#13;
strategy, with all its features, could be implemented successfully in India.&#13;
2.16   The proposed project would constitute Phase III of this process and it would&#13;
address the issues currently constraining the NTP by: (i) introducing a new and rigorous&#13;
strategy for TB control; (ii) strengthening the managerial, technical and training capacity&#13;
of the NTP, (iii) introducing a comprehensive approach to information, education and&#13;
communication (IEC) that involves private physicians, NGOs, and the communities, and&#13;
focuses on patient-provider communication; (vi) strengthening the technical knowledge&#13;
and skill of service providers inside and outside the government; and (v) promoting the&#13;
integration of TB services throughout the health system.&#13;
C.    External Assistance to the NTP&#13;
2.17  In the past three years, especially with the pilots in Phase I, the NTP has benefited&#13;
from the financial assistance of SIDA and the technical assistance of WHO. In addition,&#13;
the British Overseas Development Administration (ODA) was a co-financer on the Phase&#13;
II pilots, with an investment of US$1.4 million to cover immediate staffing needs in the&#13;
Central TB Division and equipment and facility expenses which were not covered by the&#13;
PPF advance. In view of the progress made in the pilots of Phase I and II, the Danish&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
International Development Assistance (DANIDA) is financing the implementation of the&#13;
new RNTP in 14 tribal districts in the State of Orissa with an investment of&#13;
approximately US$14 million, and ODA is considering financing a similar intervention in&#13;
the State of Andhra Pradesh for approximately US$25 million. IDA has worked closely&#13;
with the other donors to ensure coherence and complementarity of investments and&#13;
approaches.&#13;
D.    Lessons from Experience&#13;
2.18  The WHO tuberculosis control strategy to be adopted by the proposed project is&#13;
based on the lessons learned from rigorous evaluations of TB control projects throughout&#13;
the world by notable TB experts. These lessons have been incorporated in the five key&#13;
elements of the WHO policy for TB control: (a) the need for government commitment to&#13;
an effective TB program; (b) a focus on case detection through predominantly passive&#13;
case finding; (c) administration of standardized short-course chemotherapy to at least all&#13;
smear-positive cases, under directly observed treatment; (d) establishment and&#13;
maintenance of a system of regular drug supply, and (e) establishment and maintenance&#13;
of an effective monitoring system for program management and evaluation. The WHO&#13;
strategy has been proven effective in several countries including Tanzania, China,&#13;
Bangladesh, and Peru. Experience from Bank lending for TB Control has been limited to&#13;
projects that do not focus on TB control alone, e.g., Lesotho's Health and Population&#13;
project, China's Infectious and Endemic Disease Control Project, Bangladesh's Fourth&#13;
Population and Health project and Zimbabwe's Sexually Transmitted Infections&#13;
Prevention and Health Care project. The China and Bangladesh projects offer the best&#13;
example for India as they follow the WHO strategy and, in the case of China, it faces a&#13;
problem of similar magnitude as in India. The main lessons learned from these projects&#13;
pointed to the need for case detection through passive case finding, avoiding government&#13;
charges for TB services, and issues of sustainability for directly observed treatment.&#13;
These lessons have been taken into account in the design of this project. The proposed&#13;
project would be the first Bank lending operation to focus solely on tuberculosis control&#13;
responding to the particular situation of India and its burden of disease.&#13;
2.19  The findings from Phase I and Il pilots in India provided the most relevant lessons&#13;
for the design of the proposed project. They yielded critical information to help define&#13;
the roles of the management units at each level, the amendments needed in the technical&#13;
and operational guidelines, the technical specifications of certain medical inputs, and the&#13;
procurement and distribution systems. They also pointed to the need for: (a) a strong&#13;
Central Management Unit that would provide clear and decisive leadership and&#13;
management direction; (b) a broader project scope in order to elicit the political will&#13;
needed for successful TB control; (c) an effective and rigorous training program that&#13;
would facilitate the transfer of knowledge needed to implement the new technical&#13;
approach; (d) creative institutional arrangements to help promote the adoption of the&#13;
revised strategy not only within the existing TB structure but most importantly&#13;
throughout the health system; and (e) a strong involvement of the private and NGO sector&#13;
given the important role private physicians play in TB treatment in India. Further details&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
on the lessons learned are given in Annex 5. An expanded description of the pilots and&#13;
their findings is given in Annex 11.&#13;
E.    Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
2.20   The World Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for India (June 20,&#13;
1995, Report No. 14509-IN and update of August 15, 1996) is designed to support the&#13;
efforts of the Government of India in promoting economic growth through strong private&#13;
sector involvement and developing India's human capital resources. The Bank's&#13;
assistance strategy for the health sector in India is consistent with the CAS and is&#13;
implemented through a two-pronged approach. The first is to reduce the burden of&#13;
diseases from major public health problems by supporting priority programs, and the&#13;
second is to strengthen state health systems and promote state health sector reform to&#13;
provide more efficient and effective health care, particularly for the poor. The proposed&#13;
project is an integral part of both IDA's Country Assistance Strategy and its health&#13;
strategy for India.&#13;
2.21  IDA investment in the proposed project is justified on several grounds. First, the&#13;
project would direct resources to one of the most cost-effective health interventions, i.e.,&#13;
short course chemotherapy for smear-positive TB patients2 Second, it would advance&#13;
IDA's health strategy to support India's efforts in fighting major public health problems&#13;
and strengthening its health systems by integrating TB care with the general health&#13;
services. Third, it would support IDA's objective to reduce inequalities in health care by&#13;
improving access for disadvantaged populations, particularly women, slum dwellers and&#13;
scheduled tribes. Fourth, IDA has a comparative advantage in serving as a catalyst in&#13;
bringing the changes needed for tuberculosis control in India because of IDA's ability to&#13;
harness cooperation of important institutions in the health sector, both in India and&#13;
worldwide. Finally, IDA's intervention would provide a unique opportunity to shift the&#13;
current focus of TB control from a purely medical to a public health approach,&#13;
emphasizing the cure of infectious cases to reduce TB transmission. The anticipated&#13;
reduction in the risk of infection of TB would benefit the whole community, producing&#13;
significant positive externalities.&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    Background&#13;
3.1    As noted earlier, the proposed project has been prepared through the&#13;
implementation of pilot projects in India designed to test a new strategy for Tuberculosis&#13;
control with a focus on patient cure rather than case detection. Through September 1996,&#13;
the pilot projects have treated a total of 15,821 patients in a population base coverage of&#13;
roughly 12 million with cure rates as high as 92% and 80%, on average, for all the sites.&#13;
3.2   The implementation of the pilot projects involved field testing the revised strategy&#13;
in 15 different urban and rural sites in India. This required intensive work on the part of&#13;
the central, state and district TB officials and renowned TB specialists from major&#13;
international and Indian TB organizations to supervise and monitor the pilot projects and&#13;
complete the preparation of the proposed project. Project preparation also involved&#13;
interactions with pharmaceutical manufacturers of anti-TB drugs worldwide to discuss&#13;
and find solutions to issues related to availability, packaging and testing of anti-TB drugs&#13;
within the context of a large public health intervention and exchanges with numerous&#13;
representatives of the private and NGO sector in India to encourage their participation in&#13;
the design, preparation and implementation of the project and to learn from their own&#13;
experiences. Paras. 4.31 through 4.41 and Annex 22 give a fuller account of the status of&#13;
preparation of the project.&#13;
3.3   The experience of the pilot projects described above served as the basis for the&#13;
project design and has led to an increased demand for TB control services throughout the&#13;
country. To a large extent, the project activities related to the revised strategy are already&#13;
under implementation; the challenge for the project would be to expand those activities,&#13;
with the same degree of success, to new project areas.&#13;
B.    Project Strategy&#13;
3.4   The project would be the main vehicle to facilitate the transition of the National&#13;
Tuberculosis Control Program (NTP) to the revised strategy for TB control (RNTP). The&#13;
project's strategy to achieve this goal is two-fold:(a) to consolidate the implementation of&#13;
the revised strategy initiated through the pilot projects by expanding it to cover 30% of&#13;
the population of the country; and (b) to pave the way for a full expansion of the strategy&#13;
to the rest of the country through selected investments. In view of the rigor required by&#13;
the implementation of the revised strategy, this expansion would be achieved in a phased&#13;
manner and through a system of district eligibility for entry into the RNTP.&#13;
C.    Project Scope&#13;
3.5   The Project would constitute a time-slice financing of the national TB Control&#13;
Program over five years with the purpose of setting up the institutional and managerial&#13;
infrastructure to establish the Revised Strategy for Tuberculosis Control (RNTP) in a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
larger scale, and to facilitate its gradual expansion to the entire country within an 8-12&#13;
year time frame.&#13;
3.6   The project would strengthen the National TB Program for the entire country&#13;
through the following interventions:(a) full implementation of the Revised Strategy for&#13;
TB control (RNTP) in 102 districts; (b) strengthening of the National TB Program (NTP)&#13;
in 203 districts now nominally under short-course chemotherapy (SCC), in preparation&#13;
for initiating RNTP activities in the future; and (c) strengthening provision of services&#13;
under conventional TB treatment in 154 non-SCC districts. This would involve&#13;
modification of Program policies and procedures through new operational and technical&#13;
guidelines, strengthening of the National and State Tuberculosis Demonstration Centers,&#13;
strengthening of the central, state and district TB units, establishment of the required&#13;
management systems for implementation of the RNTP, improved and expanded selection,&#13;
training and retraining of staff, improved drug procurement, planning, storage and&#13;
distribution, rigorous monitoring and supervision, and effective communication and&#13;
information systems. Table 3.1 on page 11 provides a summary of these interventions,&#13;
their coverage and the inputs required.&#13;
D.    ProJect Goal and Objectives&#13;
3.7   The main feature of the proposed project is the introduction of a revised strategy&#13;
for Tuberculosis control to cover one third of the Indian population. It involves a major&#13;
paradigm shift designed to focus on the cure of infectious cases. The goal of the&#13;
proposed project is to reduce mortality, morbidity and disability due to TB by curing TB&#13;
cases, thereby reducing the incidence of infectious TB, the annual risk of infection and&#13;
the development of drug resistance.&#13;
3.8   Within this overall goal, the specific objectives of the project would be to:(a)&#13;
effectively diagnose and treat about 1.9 million TB cases, including an estimated total of&#13;
more than 800,000 smear-positive and severe TB cases under the revised strategy&#13;
(RNTP) for TB Control; (b) achieve 85% cure rate in the RNTP districts for newly&#13;
diagnosed smear-positive cases; (c) provide treatment with daily short-course&#13;
chemotherapy to 850,000 smear positive patients in the SCC districts, achieving a 60%&#13;
cure rate while preparing those districts to adopt the revised strategy; (d) treat about&#13;
230,000 smear-positive patients with conventional drugs in non-SCC districts; (e)&#13;
improve diagnosis to reach at least 50% smear-positive cases as a percentage of total&#13;
diagnosed cases in RNTP and SCC districts; and (f) improve the system of patient&#13;
registration and follow up to allow monitoring of treatment completion and cure in the&#13;
SCC districts. The above quantitative objectives are based on the best estimates of TB&#13;
prevalence and incidence in India and may require revision during the mid-term review&#13;
based on actual experience.&#13;

E.    Policies and Strategies&#13;
3.9    The project would bring a significant change in the main policies of the National&#13;
Tuberculosis Control Program. The following policies and strategies have been adopted&#13;
by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare as part of the implementation of the Pilot&#13;
projects and would be extended to all areas covered by the proposed project under the&#13;
revised strategy (RNTP). In addition, certain policies would be adopted by the National&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
Program for application nationwide. These new policies and procedures would address&#13;
the Program's issues and constraints identified in para. 2.8 above. They include:&#13;
(a)    A new technological paradigm for case identification, diagnosis,&#13;
treatment and follow up which involves (i) focus on infectious, smear-&#13;
positive patients; (ii) passive case finding; (iii) diagnosis and treatment&#13;
evaluation based on sputum analysis rather than X-ray; (iv) case&#13;
management under directly observed treatment (DOT); (v) appropriate&#13;
patient follow-up to ensure patient adherence to the drug regimen and the&#13;
treatment evaluation protocols; (vi) consolidation of diagnostic capacity at&#13;
selected sites and decentralization of treatment to the periphery to facilitate&#13;
access; and (vii) provision of drugs, generally in blister packs or&#13;
combination pills for all patients who have started treatment.&#13;
(b)   A modified organizational structure at the central, state, district and&#13;
sub-district level that would be more consistent with the technical,&#13;
operational and managerial requirements of the revised strategy and would&#13;
facilitate the integration into TB services to the general health system.&#13;
(c)   New training policies consistent with the requirements of the revised&#13;
strategy and designed to strengthen the role of the training and technical&#13;
institutes in training and quality control. Training would combine hands-&#13;
on clinical and laboratory training with first-hand observation of the new&#13;
operational practices as applied in the pilot areas.&#13;
(d)   New methods of assessment and quality control based on outcome&#13;
indicators such as sputum conversions from positive to negative and on&#13;
cure rates of 85% under RNTP and 60% in SCC districts, rather than case&#13;
finding targets. These assessments would rely on a rigorous new patient&#13;
registration and notification system which is based on quarterly cohort&#13;
analyses, and collects essential data such as previous history of TB,&#13;
treatment completion and cure, transfers, defaulters, deaths and treatment&#13;
failures.&#13;
(e)    A new approach to drug procurement, inventory and distribution to&#13;
ensure uninterrupted supply and availability of high quality drugs.&#13;
(f)    New information, education and communication strategies that focus&#13;
primarily on provider-patient interpersonal communication and are&#13;
designed to help patients overcome the barriers to treatment adherence.&#13;
(g)   Targeted strategies to facilitate access and improve quality of services for&#13;
disadvantaged groups, particularly tribal populations, women and mobile&#13;
groups.&#13;
(h)   New mechanisms for NGO/government collaboration.&#13;
(i)    New mechanisms to promote the involvement of the private sector in the&#13;
RNTP through better case notification, more accurate patient diagnosis,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
treatment and evaluation, or appropriate referral to government diagnostic&#13;
and treatment facilities.&#13;
3.10  These policies are consistent with the recommendations of the 1995 Central&#13;
Council of Health which underscored the seriousness of the Tuberculosis problem in&#13;
India as described in Annex 6.&#13;
3.11  During negotiations, the Government of India provided assurances that it will&#13;
implement the project and shall cause the Project States to implement the project&#13;
according to the policies and norms agreed to during preparation and described in this&#13;
document, and they will not make any changes to the Program policies or guidelines,&#13;
which, in the reasonable opinion of IDA, would adversely affect the project.&#13;
F.    Project Description&#13;
3.12  To meet the stated objectives, the project would finance activities and inputs&#13;
under three main components:(i) improving the quality, access and outcomes of TB&#13;
treatment; (ii) developing institutional and operational research capacity and enhancing&#13;
technical, managerial and interpersonal skills; and (iii) developing information,&#13;
communication and outreach activities and promoting community involvement. Overall,&#13;
the project would initiate a shift in the epidemiological profile of tuberculosis in India by&#13;
focusing on the cure of infectious patients.&#13;
IMPROVING THE OUALITY. ACCESS AND OUTCOMES OF TUBERCULOSIS&#13;
TREATMENT (US$130.0 million. 85% of the base costs)&#13;
3.13  Under the project, service delivery would be provided under three different&#13;
modalities based on the TB control strategy operating in each category of districts as&#13;
described in Table 3.1 on page 11. The three modalities are:(a) the revised strategy of&#13;
directly-observed, short-course chemotherapy (DOTS) for TB control or RNTP, to be&#13;
fully implemented in 102 districts; (b) the regular short-course chemotherapy (SCC)&#13;
approach currently in effect, at least nominally, under the National Program in 203&#13;
districts; and (c) the conventional, long-course chemotherapy approach (non-SCC)&#13;
currently under effect in 154 districts. The project would finance interventions in each of&#13;
these three categories of districts with the purpose of raising the quality of treatment&#13;
under all three approaches. This would allow for a gradual transition to the revised&#13;
strategy while optimizing the resources available for TB throughout the country.&#13;
3.14  Directly Observed. Short-Course Chemotherapy (DOTS) or Revised National&#13;
Tuberculosis Program (102 districts). The center-piece of this component is the full&#13;
package of services provided under the revised strategy for TB control in 102 districts&#13;
and metropolitan cities, covering a population of 271 million in 15 states. This involves&#13;
(a) accurate patient diagnosis through accurate history taking followed by high quality&#13;
sputum microscopy, to determine the appropriate category of TB patient and treatment&#13;
regimen; (b) appropriate communication between service provider and patient to ensure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
understanding of the treatment involved; (c) appropriate dispensation of medicines under&#13;
direct observation to guarantee treatment adherence and patient satisfaction; (d) strict&#13;
follow up and evaluation to ensure sputurn conversion to non-infectious status; and (e)&#13;
rigorous registration, supervision and monitoring system for cohort analysis to evaluate&#13;
treatment outcomes and risks. The technical, operational and laboratory guidelines&#13;
completed as part of project preparation provide detailed explanations about patient&#13;
classification, types of drug regimens to be administered, case diagnosis, registration,&#13;
management, and patient follow up. Excerpts from these guidelines are included in&#13;
Annex 1 and Annex 2.&#13;
3.15   Clinical diagnosis would be performed at any health facility selected by the&#13;
patient; however, laboratory diagnosis would take place at selected microscopy centers&#13;
(MCs) which would be upgraded under this project component. Concentration of&#13;
diagnostic work in selected facilities would raise the proficiency of laboratory workers&#13;
and increase the level of accuracy in diagnosis. The selected diagnostic or microscopy&#13;
centers would become referral centers for diagnostic and follow up purposes only. Once&#13;
the patient has been identified and diagnosed as having TB, treatment would be delivered&#13;
at the health facility closest to the patient's home and a designated health worker or&#13;
community volunteers would be identified to provide directly observed treatment (DOT).&#13;
The short-course chemotherapy (SCC) regimen used requires that the medicines be&#13;
administered under direct observation and strict patient follow up and evaluation. Quality&#13;
control of laboratory diagnosis, patient registration and final outcomes would be&#13;
monitored by a sub-district team (Tuberculosis Unit) according to a regular supervision&#13;
program and reporting responsibilities. The different regimens to be used for each&#13;
category of patient under the revised strategy are described in Annex I and Annex 2.&#13;
3.16   Expansion of the revised strategy (RNTP) would be done in a phased manner. It&#13;
is expected that 39 districts would initiate activities in the first year, 39 in the second and&#13;
24 in the third. In all cases, however, participation by a district under the RNTP would&#13;
be based on the districts meeting the eligibility criteria described in Annex 7.&#13;
3.17  For these 102 RNTP districts under this component, the project would finance&#13;
investments in civil works, laboratory and other equipment, vehicles, drugs, salaries of&#13;
additional staff, honoraria to DOT workers (excepting salaried government health&#13;
workers), incremental operating costs, laboratory supplies, vehicle and equipment&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
3.18   Standard Short-Course Chemotherapy (203 SCC districts). Under this&#13;
component, the project would finance inputs and activities to strengthen existing TB&#13;
services and introduce certain features of the revised strategy in 203 districts currently&#13;
operating nominally under short-course chemotherapy regimens. Despite their&#13;
denomination as "short-course chemotherapy" districts, many of them lack sufficient&#13;
inputs to provide appropriate services under SCC. Through this project, such districts&#13;
would receive a regular supply of short-course chemotherapy drugs for smear-positive&#13;
patients under the standard regimen for short-course chemotherapy used by the National&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Program (see Annex 2). The project would also provide inputs to improve laboratory&#13;
diagnosis, patient classification and registration, and evaluation of treatment results&#13;
through cohort analysis. The SCC drugs for smear-positive patients would be provided&#13;
by the center to the states with the understanding that the state would provide a regular&#13;
supply of conventional drugs to treat smear-negative patients according to the regimen&#13;
described in Annex 2. The 203 districts would adopt the diagnostic and registration&#13;
system of the RNTP in preparation for full transition to the revised strategy.&#13;
3.19   During negotiations, the Government of India provided assurances that:(a) the&#13;
SCC treatment regimen provided for the SCC districts would not include rifampicin in&#13;
the continuation phase; (b) the RNTP patient registration and reporting system would be&#13;
utilized in those districts and (c) the supply of SCC drugs by the Project to a district will&#13;
be liable to be discontinued if the district fails to maintain an annual average of 60% cure&#13;
rate after the first two quarters of implementation.&#13;
3.20  For these 203 SCC districts, the project would finance investments in civil works,&#13;
laboratory and other equipment, drugs for smear-positive patients only, vehicles and&#13;
salaries of additional staff at the district level only, incremental operating costs,&#13;
laboratory supplies, vehicle and equipment maintenance.&#13;
3.21   Long-Course Chemotherapy Districts (154 non-SCC districts). Under this&#13;
component, the project would finance inputs to improve the quality of TB treatment&#13;
under conventional or long-course chemotherapy (LCC) for smear-positive patients by&#13;
ensuring a regular supply of LCC drugs. The Center would provide LCC drugs for smear&#13;
positive patients while the states would provide the same drugs for all other patients. For&#13;
the 154 non-SCC districts, the project would finance conventional or LCC drugs for&#13;
smear positive patients.&#13;
3.22  During negotiations, the Government of India provided assurances that it will&#13;
provide drugs on a regular basis to all smear-positive cases in the non-RNTP districts,&#13;
and it will ensure that conventional drugs have been provided for smear-negative patients&#13;
based on expected case load.&#13;
3.23  NGO and Private Sector Involvement in Service Delivery. The project would&#13;
give particular emphasis to NGOs and private practitioners involvement in the RNTP&#13;
districts. Several modalities for their involvement have been discussed and would be&#13;
implemented through the project; these would include, for example:(a) providing free&#13;
medicines to NGOs who adopt the RNTP strategy; (b) arranging to provide training and&#13;
orientation to private practitioners in exchange for managing TB patients under&#13;
agreement of case notification to the government; (c) involving NGOs and private&#13;
practitioners in operations research activities which involve service delivery; (d)&#13;
providing free directly observed treatment to patients diagnosed by private practitioners&#13;
who are following the RNTP criteria; (e) providing educational materials and other IEC&#13;
inputs to NGOs or private practitioners for community involvement; (f) providing&#13;
diagnostic facilities at identified centers, treatment evaluation, drug supply referral sites&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
for referrals from private practitioners and NGOs; and (g) possibly contracting with an&#13;
organization to provide comprehensive RNTP services at a district or sub-district level.&#13;
3.24  During negotiations the Government of India provided assurances that, where&#13;
RNTP is being carried out, the Project States will develop and implement (a) a strategy&#13;
for involvement of NGOs and Associations such as the Indian Medical Association; (b) a&#13;
strategy for qualified medical practitioners which could include medical education,&#13;
information and communication on various aspects of TB and referral mechanisms for&#13;
RNTP; and (c) a strategy to promote referral of symptomatic patients to RNTP by other&#13;
health practitioners. It was also agreed that specific annual plans for such strategies&#13;
would be furnished to the Association no later than March 31 every two years.&#13;
DEVELOPING INSTITUTIONAL. OPERATIONAL AND RESEARCH CAPACITY&#13;
AND ENHANCING TECHNICAL. MANAGERIAL AND INTERPERSONAL SKILLS&#13;
(US$16.2 million. 11% of base costs)&#13;
3.25  The success of the project would depend largely on increased institutional&#13;
capacity at the central, state and district level and upgrading the technical, managerial and&#13;
interpersonal skills of the different categories of staff involved in the project. To achieve&#13;
this, the project would finance activities related to organizational development and&#13;
training.&#13;
3.26  Institutional Capacity. Managerial effectiveness is a central requirement for the&#13;
success of the program, particularly under the RNTP. The project would provide inputs&#13;
for strengthening the Management Cells at the central, state, city, district and sub-district&#13;
level and adopting effective supervision, monitoring and communication systems. It&#13;
would also support inputs for strengthening the Central Training and State Institutes and&#13;
State Demonstration and Training Centers.&#13;
3.27  The Organizational Design of the RNTP. The organizational structure of the&#13;
RNTP requires:(a) a strong Central Management Cell that can provide technical and&#13;
operational guidance, appropriate supervision, adequate inputs and close program&#13;
monitoring to the States; (b) a State Management Unit that would ensure integration of&#13;
the strategy into the general health system, would coordinate all state TB activities and&#13;
monitor the program throughout the state; (c) a District Management Unit responsible for&#13;
providing technical guidance, supervision, and logistical support to the periphery; and (d)&#13;
a number of Sub-district Tuberculosis Units (TU) to act as links between the district and&#13;
the periphery and carry out strict supervision and quality control of the program including&#13;
patient registration, diagnosis, case management and reporting. These supervisory units&#13;
(TUs) constitute the only new feature of the organizational structure. The success of the&#13;
RNTP depends heavily on the effective functioning of these units. A network of&#13;
"microscopy centers" established per 100,000 population in different health facilities&#13;
would report to the TUs and serve as diagnostic and evaluation centers. Treatment would&#13;
be offered in the periphery at PHCs and subcenters by health staff and community health&#13;
workers. The project would support strengthening of the management units at different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
levels as described below.&#13;
3.28  Management Unit at the Central Level. The Central Tuberculosis Division in the&#13;
Ministry of Health has been strengthened during the past two years based on the&#13;
requirements of the pilot projects. During this time, they have played a major role in the&#13;
preparation of the project and the staff are fully familiar with the requirements for project&#13;
implementation. However, with the new project scope, the Central Division would need&#13;
to be strengthened further. The Division would manage the project at the central level.&#13;
Its overall responsibility would be to provide leadership, supervision and direction to the&#13;
program and be accountable for consolidating the transition to the RNTP. A National&#13;
Program Director at the level of Deputy Director General (DDG) dedicated solely to the&#13;
management of the TB Program has been appointed.&#13;
3.29  The Division's main responsibilities would be to prepare, disseminate and enforce&#13;
technical and operational policies and guidelines; ensure compliance with the program&#13;
policies, provide technical assistance to the states and districts; ensure quality control and&#13;
monitor program implementation. The supervisory and monitoring role of the Central&#13;
Management Unit is described in Annex 20.&#13;
3.30  The planning, administrative policy decisions, accounting, budgeting, financial&#13;
management, other administrative decisions, recruitment and coordination would be&#13;
undertaken by the administrative division of the Ministry of Health under the supervision&#13;
of the Joint Secretary responsible for the Tuberculosis Program. This administrative&#13;
division will be strengthened by adding one new official at the level of Undersecretary&#13;
and two assistants. The training, IEC and staff recognition activities of the project would&#13;
be a joint responsibility with the technical unit. A Coordination Committee or National&#13;
Tuberculosis Control Board would be established at the National level to review the&#13;
planning, implementation and evaluation of the program, make financial&#13;
recommendations and coordinate activities with NGOs, the private sector and&#13;
international donors. In addition, the Central Division would identify areas and&#13;
mechanisms of coordination with the National AIDS Program to ensure adequate inter-&#13;
program support.&#13;
3.31   Management at the State Level. The State TB Cells have been strengthened as&#13;
part of the pilot projects in the States where the RNTP would be implemented. However,&#13;
further strengthening would be needed with the expansion of the project scope. The State&#13;
Tuberculosis Control Cell would be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the&#13;
project in the participating districts. Specifically, they would be responsible for (i)&#13;
ensuring adequate supply of inputs to the service facilities, including drugs and laboratory&#13;
supplies; (ii) ensuring district compliance with eligibility criteria for participating in the&#13;
proposed project; (iii) overseeing the functioning of the District TB Centers; (iv)&#13;
coordinating TB activities with other health institutions; (v) identifying and correcting&#13;
bottlenecks in implementation; (vi) overseeing implementation of staff training plans; and&#13;
(vii) ensuring quality control and appropriate recording for monitoring of project&#13;
outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
3.32  The State Cell would be responsible for the supervision and monitoring of the&#13;
program throughout the state, including metropolitan cities, and for ensuring the&#13;
integration of the revised strategy throughout the health system. To respond to these&#13;
demands, the existing State TB cells would be strengthened with additional staff and&#13;
equipment. The position of TB State Program officer would be upgraded to give the&#13;
program the prominence required. The State TB Officer would be assisted by a Medical&#13;
Officer, an IEC officer, a Personal Assistant and an Accountant. A State Coordinating&#13;
Committee would be established to ensure appropriate integration of the RNTP with&#13;
health institutions outside the National TB Program and with NGOs and the private&#13;
sector.&#13;
3.33  District Level Management. The District Tuberculosis Center (DTC) is the key&#13;
organizational unit responsible for implementation of the Revised Tuberculosis Control&#13;
Program (RNTP). The role of the DTC would change from being only a service provider&#13;
to one involving Program management, training, drug distribution, supervision, and&#13;
monitoring at the district level. The success of the Program would depend largely on the&#13;
effectiveness of the District TB Center, and the District TB Officer would play an&#13;
essential role in ensuring that the operational and technical policies of the program are&#13;
appropriately implemented in the district. The DTCs would be strengthened with medical&#13;
and laboratory equipment and supplies, civil works, office supplies, vehicles and office&#13;
equipment. The District TB Center would be supported by Sub-district TB Units (TUs)&#13;
comprising of a Senior TB Supervisor (STS) and a Senior TB Laboratory Supervisor&#13;
(STLS). These sub-district supervisory units serve as the link between the district level&#13;
and the periphery and provide the rigor to the program's management system as they&#13;
ensure appropriate case management and patient registration and reporting. The&#13;
supervisory team would supervise the work of different categories of staff at the&#13;
periphery in their jurisdiction. TUs would be established at existing CHCs or Taluk or&#13;
sub-district hospitals for every 300,000 - 500,000 population. The composition and role&#13;
of the Tuberculosis Unit is described in Annex 3.&#13;
3.34  During negotiations, the Government of India provided assurances that the Central&#13;
Unit and the RNTP units in the Project States will be adequately staffed and maintained&#13;
for the duration of the Project and at least 50% of the additional staff at the Central and&#13;
the RNTP State Cells will be in position by July 1, 1997, and 90% of the staff shall be in&#13;
place by December 31, 1997. It was also agreed that a full time State TB Officer would&#13;
be in position by July 31, 1997 in all RNTP states, and District TB Officers will&#13;
ordinarily remain in their posts for a minimum of two years.&#13;
3.35  District Tuberculosis Societies. To provide administrative support to the District&#13;
TB Center or corporation subdivision, a District TB Society or equivalent society would&#13;
be formed prior to the implementation of the RNTP. The purpose of the society would be&#13;
to facilitate the transfer of funds from the center to the periphery, plan and coordinate TB&#13;
activities with the NGO and the private sector, engage temporary workers, purchase small&#13;
quantities of medical and office items, and carry out other administrative responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
An important innovation of the TB Society is that they would be authorized to raise their&#13;
own funds for TB control. In some states, the existing District Leprosy Society would be&#13;
expanded to include TB while in others a new Society would be established for TB. The&#13;
role and constitution of the Society is described in para. 4.27 below and in Annex 8.&#13;
3.36   During negotiations, the Government of India provided assurances that:(a) all&#13;
District TB Societies, or equivalent society, will have been established by March 31.&#13;
1997 in the first 39 RNTP districts, by January 31, 1998 in the next 39 RNTP districts,&#13;
and by January 31, 1999 in the remaining 24 RNTP districts; and (b) no RNTP activities&#13;
can be initiated prior to the establishment of a District TB Society.&#13;
3.37   City Level Management. Cities operate under a separate and independent&#13;
organizational structure outside of the structure of the Tuberculosis Control program.&#13;
The TB Management Unit at the city level would be the responsibility of the designated&#13;
Health Officer of the municipal corporation, under the overall guidance of the&#13;
Corporation Commissioner. The District TB Officer of the District where the corporation&#13;
is embedded would also be a member of that management team. As in the case of the&#13;
districts, the larger cities would be divided into zones. TB Units with supervisory teams&#13;
would be established to supervise the microscopy or diagnostic centers designated for&#13;
every million population. These units would be staffed with one Senior Laboratory&#13;
Supervisor (STLS) available for every 500,000 population and one Senior Tuberculosis&#13;
Supervisor (STS) available for every three to four microscopy centers.&#13;
3.38   Central Training Institutes. The National TB Institute (NTI) in Bangalore, the&#13;
Tuberculosis Research Center (TRC) in Madras, the Lala Ram Swarup Institute of TB&#13;
and Allied Diseases (LRS) in Delhi, and the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public&#13;
Health (AIIH&amp;PH) in Calcutta would play a pivotal role in the implementation of the&#13;
RNTP by providing the training and quality control required by the revised strategy. In&#13;
addition to these institutes, other institutions such as the National Institute of&#13;
Communicable Diseases (NICD), selected medical colleges, and institutions of&#13;
prominence in the states would also be designated as Central Institutes following an&#13;
evaluation based on the criteria stated in Annex 9 and in consultation with the&#13;
Association. All these institutes would have responsibility over designated districts or&#13;
subdistricts as assigned by the Central TB Division. They would be responsible for&#13;
training trainers, monitoring and evaluating the quality of training, and producing&#13;
appropriate training materials. In addition, the institutes' responsibilities may include&#13;
ensuring quality of laboratory work, performing culture and sensitivity tests for&#13;
epidemiological purposes, and involving under and post-graduate medical students and&#13;
the faculty of medical colleges and affiliated hospitals. The selected institutes would be&#13;
provided with laboratory equipment, vehicles, all training materials for the expected&#13;
category of trainees.&#13;
3.39   During negotiations, the Government of India provided assurances that (a) the&#13;
designated Central Institutions would adopt and promote RNTP in all activities relevant&#13;
to the Project and will carry out their training, monitoring and quality control functions,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
including the development and maintenance of demonstration sites for field practice, in&#13;
accordance with agreed procedures; (b) an annual report on the Central Institutions'&#13;
performance and recommendations for action will be furnished to IDA by December 31&#13;
of each year during the first three years of the Project; and (c) continued involvement of&#13;
these institutions in the activities of the Project will be determined by mutual agreement&#13;
between IDA and MOHFW based on their performance.&#13;
3.40   State Demonstration and Training Centers. One of the most important project&#13;
interventions for capacity building is the strengthening of 16 State Demonstration and&#13;
Training Centers which would play a major role in training of several categories of staff&#13;
at the district level, conduct surveillance of drug resistant cases, and operations research,&#13;
on a selective basis. Given the uneven performance level of these institutes,&#13;
strengthening would be linked to their level of effectiveness in implementing their&#13;
expected functions. Initially they would receive equipment, vehicle and training aids.&#13;
Inputs for civil works, additional laboratory equipment, other equipment, salaries,&#13;
vehicles and related expenses would be linked to performance after the first year of the&#13;
project. Centers would be evaluated according to the criteria detailed in Annex 9.&#13;
3.41   Strengthening Monitoring and Evaluation. The project provides for several&#13;
mechanisms to ensure appropriate project monitoring, ensuring quality control and&#13;
rewarding good performance. The strategy to be used for this purpose includes:(a) a&#13;
system of regular supervisory visits at all levels which include bi-annual appraisal&#13;
missions by the Central TB Division to assess readiness of districts to move into the&#13;
RNTP, based on agreed eligibility criteria; (b) a management and information system that&#13;
would allow for data analysis at different levels and as input for management decisions;&#13;
(c) a set of clear performance indicators to measure project performance; and (d) a&#13;
recognition system to acknowledge successful performance by units, teams or individuals&#13;
at different levels. Details of the monitoring process are discussed in paras. 4.42-4.43&#13;
below. For this portion of the institutional building component, the project would finance&#13;
local and international travel expenses, workshops, hardware and software, equipment&#13;
maintenance, consulting services, and incremental salary costs. During negotiations, the&#13;
Government of India provided assurances that: (a) only such districts which have met the&#13;
eligibility criteria for each level of participation will participate in the RNTP; (b) the first&#13;
two appraisals of the districts' eligible to enter the RNTP will be submitted to IDA for&#13;
review prior to MOHFW approval; and (c) the borrower would provide IDA a sample of&#13;
20% of district project appraisals approved by the borrower for review by IDA on an ex-&#13;
post basis.&#13;
3.42   Management Information Systems. An important institutional strengthening&#13;
aspect of the project would be the establishment of an effective (MIS) system that would&#13;
facilitate project monitoring. The rigorous registration and recording system&#13;
characteristic of the revised strategy and the cohort analysis approach provide sound basis&#13;
for project management if the information can flow effectively from the districts to the&#13;
project management units. Until now, the information collected in the pilots is paper-&#13;
based. This approach would continue during the first year of the project as the amount&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
and source of the data would still be limited; however, by the second year, a system&#13;
would be in place to allow for electronic flow of data from the periphery to the Center&#13;
through the intermediate units.&#13;
3.43  The Management Information System (MIS) for the program would be linked to&#13;
NICNET, the national health information management system used by the MOH to&#13;
collect data nationwide. The system would be the main vehicle for the communication of&#13;
information from the district level to the state, and then to the central level, and back&#13;
down again. The primary advantage of NICNET in the proposed MIS is that it is already&#13;
functioning and that the network reaches all district, state, and key central government&#13;
institutions. The use of NICNET would also be consistent with existing government&#13;
policy to support a standardized health information management system.&#13;
3.44  However, to meet the need for more user friendly interfaces than what NICNET&#13;
can offer, a new system would be developed so that while NICNET would be the&#13;
communication medium, the system interface would be more user friendly for program&#13;
managers at the central, state, and district levels, and would allow for the compilation,&#13;
analysis, and graphic presentation of information for a user specified time frame, for any&#13;
combination of reporting units responsible to the unit performing the analysis. This&#13;
would allow for a District to produce reports for any Tuberculosis Unit or units in the&#13;
district; a state to produce reports for any district or combination of districts; and the&#13;
Central Unit to produce reports for any combination of states or districts. Appropriate&#13;
hardware and software configurations to support the system would be purchased.&#13;
During negotiations, the Government of India provided assurances that the MOHFW will&#13;
establish an appropriate information system no later than November 30, 1997; and by&#13;
December 31, 1998, an information system to allow electronic reporting, based on&#13;
technical specifications to be agreed with IDA.&#13;
3.45  Developing Operations Research Capacity. With the introduction of a new&#13;
technical and operational paradigm, operations research is critical in guiding the&#13;
implementation of the revised strategy and assessing the effectiveness of the operational&#13;
design for program delivery. Operations research activities are being carried out&#13;
primarily by the four Central Institutes mentioned above; however, because of a lack of&#13;
trained operational researchers, emphasis has been on clinical and laboratory research&#13;
with little understanding of operational factors affecting results. It is expected that the&#13;
project would reverse this trend and help India pave the way for achieving its long term&#13;
goals of: (a) establishing a cadre of researchers able to carry out high quality operational&#13;
research in the field of TB and able to teach those skills to others; (b) determining the&#13;
best operational methods for TB control in different Indian settings; and (c) forging&#13;
useful links between the community of Indian researchers working on TB and other&#13;
experts throughout the world. Within the scope of the project, the objective would be to&#13;
(a) identify the main operational research priorities for TB in the next ten years and&#13;
develop appropriate research protocols and terms of reference for future research; (b)&#13;
establish a system for designing, developing, implementing, analyzing and monitoring&#13;
research projects; (c) design and initiate a researchers training program; (d) establish a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
mechanism to ensure that the findings of operations research activities are incorporated&#13;
into the national program; (e) carry out a minimum of four operational research studies&#13;
during the five years of the project; (f) coordinate operational research activities with&#13;
those supported by other donors such as ODA, WHO and DANIDA; and (g) bring into&#13;
oper-ations research new important dimensions of TB control such as economic and socio-&#13;
bhali\ ioral aspects and the role of the private sector. Possible areas of research have been&#13;
iLicni.Ocd in Annex 10.&#13;
3.46   ( l)cratiomal research activities would be organized and managed by the Central&#13;
Programl D)i\ ision of the Director General of Health Services in the Ministry of Health&#13;
and approved by the Health Secretary, Government of India. A Technical Steering&#13;
Committee chaired by the Director General of Health Services with the Deputy Director&#13;
General Health Services (TB) as member secretary and comprised of members of the&#13;
main research institutions, medical colleges, other National Health Institutes, NGOs, and&#13;
concerned donor representatives would be responsible for reviewing the terms of&#13;
reference, protocol proformas, and making recommendations to the Secretary of Health&#13;
for administrative approval of activities to be undertaken. The approved activities shall&#13;
then be submitted to IDA and WHO or other donors for review to determine funding.&#13;
The committee will have representatives of disciplines such as economics, and other&#13;
social sciences to ensure a broad understanding of issues related to TB control. Further&#13;
details on the operational research component of the project are given in Annex 10.&#13;
3.47 Enhancing Technical. Managerial and Interpersonal Skills. The shift to the&#13;
revised strategy for TB control and the strengthening of the Program nationwide, would&#13;
require significant efforts in training. The project would focus primarily on training of&#13;
staff for the RNTP. The training strategy emphasizes the following:(a) a decentralized&#13;
approach to training through an initial program of "train the trainers" to build a cadre of&#13;
key trainers in the RNTP for all categories of staff, (b) a participatory training approach&#13;
focusing on hands-on, experimental training to ensure not only improvement in&#13;
knowledge, but also improvement in skills; (c) a program for development of&#13;
management and organizational skills for project managers through participation in&#13;
national and international management courses; and (c) a program for developing&#13;
interpersonal skills for health personnel as an integral part of the technical training for&#13;
service providers.&#13;
3.48 The Central Institutes would train State TB officers and trainers from the State&#13;
Demonstration and Training Centers (SDTC). The 16 State and District Demonstration&#13;
Centers and other selected government and NGO institutions judged to be qualified to&#13;
impart training would train all District Trainers and district-level officers, and the&#13;
supervisory staff at the district levels (Senior TB Supervisor and Senior TB Laboratory&#13;
supervisor). Translation of training materials into the local languages would be the&#13;
responsibility of the State TB Cell in consultation with the State Demonstration and&#13;
Training Centers. A total of 8,840 State officials would be trained at the Central&#13;
Institutes and the SDTCs. Trainers would be selected from a range of health officials as&#13;
described in Annex 9.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
3.49  Training of all district staff would take place in the District TB Centers, selected&#13;
District or Taluk hospitals, Medical Colleges, and Family Welfare Training Centers. In&#13;
addition, the District Tuberculosis Center, with guidance from the central and state cells,&#13;
would assess training needs, monitor and report all training activities in the district.&#13;
Annex 9 provides a description of the categories and number of staff to be trained,&#13;
duration and areas of training.&#13;
3.50  A newly designed curricula for all categories of staff for the RNTP is being&#13;
developed with the involvement of the Central training institutes. Some modules have&#13;
been completed and are being tested and revised based on the experience of the pilot&#13;
projects. During negotiations, the Government of India provided assurances that the new&#13;
RNTP curricula, including the new curricula for participatory training in interpersonal&#13;
skills, will be used in training for all categories of staff no later than September 30, 1997.&#13;
3.51   Management Training. This would involve selective, short-term training for&#13;
Project managers at all levels based on the required skills needed for their functions at&#13;
management and technical institutes in India or outside India, or through field visits to&#13;
successful programs. Selection for management training would be based on performance&#13;
and commitment to continue in the assignment for at least the following two years after&#13;
training.&#13;
3.52  Interpersonal Skills Training. This training would be linked to the Information,&#13;
Education and Communication (IEC) strategy described below and it would focus on&#13;
participatory training for service providers who interact directly with patients.&#13;
Interpersonal communication training would be an integral part of the technical training&#13;
design.&#13;
3.53  In summary, for the capacity building and skills enhancement component, the&#13;
proposed project would finance investments in civil works, laboratory and other&#13;
equipment, vehicles, salaries of additional staff, training and workshops, incremental&#13;
operating costs, vehicle and equipment maintenance.&#13;
DEVELOPING INFORMATION. EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION, AND&#13;
PROMOTING OUTREACH ACTIVITIES AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT&#13;
(US$5.9 Million or 4% of base cost).&#13;
3.54  Information. Education and Communication (IEC). The main purpose of this&#13;
component is to raise the quality of care given to TB patients, promote a better&#13;
understanding of tuberculosis and its cure, and reduce the stigma associated with TB&#13;
where this exists. The purpose is to address not only the technical and clinical aspects of&#13;
TB treatment, but the social and communication dimensions to achieve greater patient&#13;
satisfaction. This strategy should enhance case holding and increase the number of cases&#13;
that present themselves for treatment through passive case finding. A sequenced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
approach to IEC would include activities with specific goals in addition to the overall&#13;
goal of improving the quality of care; these would involve: (a) training in IEC to&#13;
strengthen state and central IEC cells; (b) production of educational and counseling&#13;
materials for health providers in the public and private sectors; (c) integration, through a&#13;
newsletter, of program information, recognition schemes, and basic medical information&#13;
on RNTP and NTP norms; (d) development of counseling materials for patients; and (e)&#13;
development of materials (including limited use of mass media) for opinion leaders and&#13;
the public to sensitize them to the problems faced by TB sufferers and to create a more&#13;
favorable social environment for those with TB.&#13;
3.55  Interpersonal communication and counseling (IPC/C) for patients would be&#13;
improved through training TB health care providers at all levels of the health delivery&#13;
system, from state TB officers to multipurpose workers, as indicated in para. 3.47 above.&#13;
Materials to support training (e.g., video) would be developed. IPC/C training would&#13;
constitute an integral part of clinical TB training methodology. The training would use a&#13;
modified tier approach: state level trainers would be trained at the Center and would be&#13;
responsible for implementing training in their states. All personnel who would train&#13;
others would receive training on how to conduct training, and those responsible for&#13;
supervising others as part of the RNTP would receive training in supervisory skills. A&#13;
supervisory checklist and monitoring procedures would be developed and integrated into&#13;
training. Details about the IEC Strategy are given in Annex 18.&#13;
3.56  Promoting Outreach Activities and Community Involvement. This aspect of this&#13;
component is geared primarily to promoting better TB care among service providers in&#13;
the NGO and private sector and involving the community in TB control. This would be&#13;
done by providing informational seminars, workshops and conferences through the Indian&#13;
Medical Association (IMA) and other professional organizations, to disseminate the&#13;
principles of the revised strategy, the government approach to TB control, and to&#13;
encourage case notification and referral, when appropriate. High quality printed materials&#13;
would be provided to private and NGO physicians. In addition, NGOs working in TB,&#13;
through national and state participation of umbrella NGOs and participation of grassroots&#13;
NGOs at the local level, would be included in policy planning and implementation.&#13;
Cured patients who have adhered faithfully to the treatment would be invited to receive&#13;
training as needed and be incorporated into the interpersonal communication program in&#13;
the capacity of educator and counselor for TB patients and symptomatic community&#13;
members. Similarly, several outreach activities would be implemented to involve&#13;
community leaders such as the Panchayats, women's groups, NGOs and grass-roots&#13;
organizations to support initiatives to help TB patients deal with the disease and support&#13;
the directly observed treatment approach. IEC efforts would be coordinated and advised&#13;
nationally by an IEC Advisory Committee and the IEC specialist hired for this purpose at&#13;
the Central level.&#13;
3.57  For this component, the project would finance publicity services including&#13;
education materials, informational pamphlets, consulting services, as well as workshops,&#13;
and support to NGOs.&#13;

IV. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.      Costs&#13;
4.1     Summary of Costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at Rs. 7,492.8&#13;
million or US$176.4 million equivalent including taxes and duties estimated at US$11.1&#13;
millioni equivalent. The direct and indirect foreign exchange cost is estimated at US$88.1&#13;
millioni. Tlhe project would finance civil works, equipment, vehicles, drugs, publicity&#13;
services, support to NGOs, training and workshops. The project would also finance&#13;
operational expenses, laboratory supplies, maintenance of vehicles and equipment&#13;
purchased with project funds, honoraria to non-salaried workers involved primarily with&#13;
directly observed treatment (DOT), and salaries of incremental staff, all on a declining&#13;
basis. Details of cost estimates, the financing plan, procurement arrangements and&#13;
disbursement plans are shown in Annex 12.&#13;

4.4    Customs duties and taxes. All imported goods are subject to customs duties and&#13;
taxes. The estimated cost of the project includes import duties and taxes valued at about&#13;
US$1 1.1 million equivalent.&#13;
4.5    Foreign exchange component. The estimated foreign exchange component of&#13;
US$86.7 million is calculated on the basis of estimated foreign exchange proportions as&#13;
follows: (a) civil works 5%; (b) laboratory equipment 70%; (c) other equipment 15%; (d)&#13;
locally manufactured vehicles 15%; (e) drugs 90%; (g) foreign fellowships or external&#13;
training 2%; (h) incremental operating costs 5%; (i) laboratory supplies 7%; (j) vehicle&#13;
maintenance 10%; and (k) equipment maintenance 15%.&#13;
4.6        Contingency allowances. Estimated project costs included physical&#13;
contingencies (US$19.7 million) estimated at 10% for civil works, equipment of all types,&#13;
vehicles, laboratory supplies and training, and 5% for all salaries, publicity services,&#13;

support to NGOs, honoraria to volunteer DOT workers and maintenance items. Due to&#13;
the uncertainty of patient demand and drug pricing, especially as the project moves&#13;
toward the introduction of multi-drug combination pills, the estimate includes a 20%&#13;
physical contingency amount for the drug component. The estimated costs of the project&#13;
also include price contingencies (US$4.5 million) to account for expected price escalation&#13;
at the following rates:&#13;

B.    Financing Plan&#13;
4.7   The project would be centrally sponsored. The proposed IDA Credit of US$142.4&#13;
million equivalent would cover 86.1 percent of the incremental net cost of the TB&#13;
Program, above the level of financing for the National Tuberculosis Control Program in&#13;
Indian fiscal year 1994-95 as shown on page 28 as Table 4.3. The IDA portion of the&#13;
financing arrangements amounts to about 86.1 percent of the total project costs net of&#13;
taxes. The Government of India would finance the remaining costs of US$22.9 million&#13;
plus all taxes and duties (US$1 1.1 million).&#13;
4.8   The credit would be made available to GOI on standard terms and conditions and&#13;
made available to the states on a grant basis under standard arrangements for&#13;
development assistance to the states.&#13;
C.    Economic Analysis&#13;
4.9   Economic Benefits  The Burden of Disease study for India, undertaken for the&#13;
1993 World Development Report, indicated that tuberculosis is responsible for 3.7&#13;
percent of the country's total burden of disease. Seen in another perspective this is eleven&#13;
times more than malaria, six times more than the tropical cluster of diseases and two and&#13;
a half times more than AIDS. The incidence of TB tends to peak among those in mid-&#13;
adulthood. This age group has the highest level of labor productivity and is the group in&#13;
which society has already invested the largest amounts of human capital. In addition,&#13;
studies in Bangladesh indicate that children of parents with illnesses such as TB are two&#13;
and a half times more likely to suffer severe malnutrition. The economic and social costs&#13;
of TB are likely to be high.&#13;
4.10  Results from the more recent and detailed Burden of Disease study for the state of&#13;
Andhra Pradesh provide more details of the destructive nature of the disease. Among the&#13;
causes of death in rural areas 1988-93, TB was exceeded only by bronchitis and heart&#13;

attacks for males, and by these illnesses plus fever, cancer and child-bearing deaths&#13;
among females. For 1993, TB was responsible for ten percent of all DALYs for males&#13;
and just over five percent for females. Among the 15-45 year age group, TB was the&#13;
leading cause of death among both the urban and rural population. Twenty percent of all&#13;
DALYs for males between 15 and 60 are caused by TB. For females the figure is ten&#13;
percent. TB is the major cause of death among the economically active population.&#13;
4.11   The population of India is roughly 920 million. Those regarded at risk (above&#13;
five years of age) number 798 million. Applying the results of discussions of expert&#13;
groups utilized for the burden of disease study in Andhra Pradesh across the whole&#13;
country suggests that 20 million TB symptomatics (2.5%) exist annually. Of these,&#13;
16.4% or 3.27 million would develop the disease each year. Tuberculosis is not fatal for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
all those who contract the disease. The spontaneous cure rate is roughly 30 %. Those&#13;
requiring treatment would be 2.3 million. Sixty percent of these patients, or 1.4 million,&#13;
are expected to seek treatment in the public sector. Currently, WHO estimates that the&#13;
cure rate for the standard chemotherapy treatment in the public sector is 35%, implying&#13;
that 480,000 patients are cured each year. The expected cure rate from the RNTP&#13;
regimen supported through the proposed project is 85%, implying that 1.2 million would&#13;
be cured annually if the RNTP covers the entire country. These rough figures suggest&#13;
that if the RNTP was effectively adopted across the country, an additional 720,000&#13;
patient cures would be achieved each year. Many, but not all, of these patients would&#13;
have died directly from the illness without proper treatment. WHO estimates that&#13;
200,000 deaths per year would be averted if RNTP was adopted throughout the country.&#13;
4.12   The current project would not cover the whole country because some districts are&#13;
being covered by other donors. Treatment under the RNTP would be provided&#13;
comprehensively across 102 districts. The project would also provide partially for smear-&#13;
positive patients in a further 203 districts and would provide drugs for the conventional&#13;
treatment of smear-positive patients in the final 154 districts. Estimations suggest that by&#13;
the final year of the project, over 840,000 patients would be cured annually through&#13;
treatment in the public sector.&#13;
4.13   Estimates of lost output due to TB must be very approximate. For the purposes of&#13;
this exercise, annual average earnings are estimated at Rs. 5,200 a year (the daily rate for&#13;
agricultural laborers of Rs. 20 a day for 260 days). It is also assumed that, on average,&#13;
the disease is contracted 20 years prior to the normal end of working life. Discounting at&#13;
10% a year, the present value of lost outputs resulting from the deaths and continued&#13;
disability of TB patients is estimated at around Rs. 40 billion. WHO estimates of the&#13;
outcome of the project in terms of reduced deaths and patients remaining alive but&#13;
debilitated suggest that this will fall to Rs. 31 billion, saving US$257.0 million; and with&#13;
full coverage of the RNTP across the country to Rs. 23 billion. Savings in lost output&#13;
from reduced deaths alone would be over Rs. 5 billion, or US$142.0 million each year.&#13;
As a result of the project, an almost Rs.9 billion (US$260.0 million) would be saved&#13;
following full implementation of the present project.&#13;
4.14   Cost Effectiveness. The 1993 World Development Report argued that the costs&#13;
per death averted and per year of life saved make short-course chemotherapy for smear&#13;
positive TB patients the cheapest known health intervention available in developing&#13;
countries. Cost per year of life saved was estimated at between US$1 and US$4. Other&#13;
highly cost-effective health interventions including immunizations for measles and&#13;
tetanus, ORT for diarrhea and BCG vaccinations, cost between $5 and $10 per life saved.&#13;
There are, however, alternative methods of treatment. In this project, short course&#13;
chemotherapy with directly observed treatment (DOT) is to replace the standard longer&#13;
term treatment. The effectiveness of each depends on (a) the cure rate; (b) the acquired&#13;
drug resistance; and (c) the impact on the trend of the risk of infection. Of these, the cure&#13;
rate is the most important. Ideally, administered courses of both treatments have high&#13;
cure rates (around 95 percent); therefore compliance with the treatment is the most&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
important determinant of the cure rate. The social assessments undertaken for the project&#13;
suggest that poverty is a main reason for non-compliance. However, duration of&#13;
treatment also generally appears to be important. This is a major advantage of short&#13;
course chemotherapy. A third determinant is the degree of supervision and the overall&#13;
strength of the delivery system. A crucial aspect of the project (as in most programs of&#13;
short course chemotherapy) is the inclusion of DOT - directly observed treatment - three&#13;
times a week for the first 2/3 months with observed treatment once a week thereafter.&#13;
DOT is more crucial to the success of short term than standard chemotherapy since&#13;
incomplete treatment results in greater possibilities for developing resistance to the drugs&#13;
in the short course regimen. Supervision increases costs. In addition, the drugs required&#13;
for short course chemotherapy often are more expensive. The central issue arises of&#13;
whether the higher costs of the short course treatment compared to those of the standard&#13;
course are compensated for by increased effectiveness.&#13;
4.15   Preliminary data from the India pilot projects and more robust data from&#13;
elsewhere, in particular East Africa, have demonstrated that costs per cure and death&#13;
averted are higher for standard treatment than for short course chemotherapy. In one set&#13;
of estimates the costs per life saved were over twice as high for the standard treatment.&#13;
These conclusions resulted from intensive case studies over a lengthy period of time. In&#13;
many respects the results will be robust across other developing countries, including&#13;
India. For instance, the transmission rates and the age structure of patients is likely to be&#13;
similar - hence the benefits in terms of deaths averted and years of life saved from a&#13;
single cure will not be greatly different. Similarly, the results from the pilot projects&#13;
suggest cure rates for the short term regimen to be around the same as those in East&#13;
Africa (85-90 percent). However, since the cure rate for standard treatment is much&#13;
lower in India (20-35 percent) than in East Africa (60-65 percent) and much lower than in&#13;
the pilot projects areas, the improvement in deaths averted and years of life saved per&#13;
treated case as a result of the project would be greater in India. In addition, the cost of&#13;
drugs in India would be significantly below the US$40 per case used in the African&#13;
calculations. The current estimate is around US$ 13. Overall, several factors suggest that&#13;
the costs per year of life gained would be lower than the estimates for East Africa, which&#13;
themselves demonstrated the highest returns on investments in health interventions. In&#13;
addition, the difference in the cost effectiveness of the short course regimen compared to&#13;
the standard approach is also expected to be larger in India.&#13;
4.16   Financial Sustainabilitv. During the project, the incremental expenditures for&#13;
both drugs and other inputs would be funded 100% by the Central Government. At the&#13;
end of the project, it is expected that the responsibility for funding the drug component&#13;
will revert to 50:50 share. Hence financial sustainability would be an issue for both the&#13;
central and state governments. In the final year of the project, incremental expenditures&#13;
on drugs would be US$7.0 million, half of which would be subsequently borne by the&#13;
central government. Expenditures on TB in 1993/94 constituted 4.4% of total central&#13;
government health expenditures, which in turn was equal to just 0.5 % of its total&#13;
expenditure. Growth in expenditures on TB over the past seven years has been below&#13;
that of other centrally-sponsored schemes such as leprosy, blindness, both IDA supported.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
Given the experiences of the central government in maintaining higher expenditures&#13;
across other disease programs in recent years and its stated intention to give increased&#13;
priority to social sectors, and tuberculosis control in particular, the program would not be&#13;
difficult to sustain. State governments would bear responsibility for the other half of the&#13;
incremental drug expenditures and for other recurrent costs. Overall, however, the&#13;
incremental recurrent costs of the project for each state are a very small part of the total&#13;
budget, and in principle, should easily be sustained. Taking Gujarat as an example, drugs&#13;
for the NTP currently form 0.13% of the health department expenditures; even doubling&#13;
of the drugs budget would still result in a very small share which should be easily&#13;
sustainable. In practice, the reduced unit cost of drugs could well lead to only relatively&#13;
small increases in the drugs bill.&#13;
4.17  The (non drugs) incremental recurrent costs of the RNTP strategy, however,&#13;
would increase. For example, around five supervision teams consisting of a laboratory&#13;
technician and treatment supervisor would be required in each district. For the 102&#13;
districts covering 30 percent of the population the incremental recurrent costs are&#13;
anticipated to be around Rs. 383 million a year. Once the whole country is covered by&#13;
the Program the incremental recurrent cost would be around Rs. 1,283 million. It is&#13;
envisaged that these costs would then be the responsibility of the states. Part of this may&#13;
be financed through savings. Currently the states are required to fund half the cost of&#13;
drugs. In 1995/96 this totaled Rs. 400 million. Under the new RNTP Program GOI may&#13;
continue to fund drugs. The savings to the states would be equivalent to almost one third&#13;
of the incremental recurrent costs. The remaining costs, around Rs. 800 million, would&#13;
be spread across all states, implying Rs. 53 million for each of the major states. Current&#13;
health expenditures average around Rs. 5,700 million in the major states. In ten years&#13;
time, assuming an annual growth rate of 4%, they would be around Rs. 8,500 million.&#13;
Maintaining the TB program, therefore, implies an increase of around 0.6 percent in each&#13;
state's health budget. Even if the financing of the drugs bill did revert to a 50:50 share&#13;
the total increase in states' expenditures would not exceed one percent of their health&#13;
budget. This should not provide a problem.&#13;
4.18  The experiences in recent years, however, indicate the need for some caution.&#13;
Taking Gujarat as an example, drugs for the national TB program form 0.13 percent of&#13;
current health department expenditures. In principle, there should be no problem of&#13;
sustainability. In practice, the decrease in real expenditures on drugs in 1992/93 and&#13;
1993/94 suggests a constraint in that state. Similarly, of the seven states whose&#13;
expenditures have been analyzed, only Karnataka and Maharashtra significantly increased&#13;
their expenditures on TB drugs between 1991/92 and 1993/94. In the others, real&#13;
expenditures fell. To secure the necessary budgetary allocations by the state, several&#13;
provisions are being made, including linking eligibility for receiving drugs and other&#13;
inputs to previous inputs provided by the state (see para. 4.17 above). In addition, to&#13;
reduce the burden on the State, the Government of India may consider allowing District&#13;
TB Societies charter to raise their own funds for TB Control Program. A detailed&#13;
analysis on the financial sustainability of the project is given in Annex 13. During&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
negotiations, the Government of India provided assurances that the Government of India&#13;
and the RNTP States would allocate sufficient funds for the project each year.&#13;
4.19   Sustainability through Private Sector Involvement. It is estimated that as much as&#13;
60% of TB patients first consult a private physician when feeling ill with TB. Until&#13;
recently, there has been very little contact between the National TB Program and private&#13;
providers; however, it is expected that, if the project succeeds in promoting the adoption&#13;
of the RNTP guidelines for TB treatment among private providers, patients would remain&#13;
with these physicians instead of switching to the public sector as is often the case now&#13;
because of treatment failure in private hands. It is therefore expected that, while in the&#13;
short term, many patients from the private sector may switch to the government sector if&#13;
the latter succeeds in achieving high cures, in the long term, patients who are able to pay&#13;
for drugs would continue to use the services of the private physicians who offer other&#13;
advantages, particularly privacy.&#13;
4.20  Managerial Sustainability. The introduction of the revised strategy with its&#13;
requirement of directly observed treatment and rigorous recording and registration&#13;
system, would require a commitment on the part of the Government of India to maintain&#13;
a strong central Program Division and strengthen the role of the Central Institutes. It will&#13;
require the commitment from the states to ensure the positioning of staff at all levels,&#13;
particularly supervisory staff at the subdistrict level. This would be a critical requirement&#13;
for the success of TB control in India in the long term. Similarly, managerial&#13;
sustainability would depend largely on staff continuity at the district and sub-district&#13;
levels and a continuous and strong training program. Provisions have been made in the&#13;
project to ensure that these tasks are implemented in a timely manner.&#13;
4.21   DOT Sustainability. Regarding the sustainability of the DOT approach, the pilots&#13;
have not required the use of additional staff to provide this service but have been able to&#13;
rely on existing health paramedical staff. The same approach would be used throughout&#13;
the project. Furthermore, it is expected that with the increasing role of the Panchayat&#13;
system, the community would be able to provide the necessary support to carry out DOT&#13;
through appropriately trained community volunteers.&#13;
D.    Project Implementation&#13;
4.22  The project would be implemented in a decentralized fashion through the&#13;
structure of the National Tuberculosis Control Program, the existing health system at the&#13;
state level and below, and NGOs experienced with community participation and health&#13;
sector activities. Annex 3 and paras. 3.28-3.37 above describe the organizational&#13;
structure of the National Program and a description of the functions of each level. An&#13;
Implementation Plan is included in Annex 14.&#13;
4.23  Role of the Central TB Division: (see para. 3.28 above). Project implementation&#13;
would be coordinated by the Central Tuberculosis Division under the Director General&#13;
for Health Services in the MOHFV with the support of the Central Training and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Research Institutes. From the administrative side of the Ministry, the project would be&#13;
coordinated by an official at the level of Joint Secretary. The Division would be&#13;
responsible for the management of the proposed project. This would include:&#13;
coordinating the program with the states, ensuring flow of funds to States and District&#13;
Societies, overseeing the implementation of the technical and operational policies,&#13;
guidelines and procedures through frequent field visits and data analysis, coordinating the&#13;
procurement and distribution of drugs, vehicles and selected equipment, reviewing media&#13;
services and program evaluation proposals. It would also oversee implementation of&#13;
training, IEC and outreach, monitoring and evaluation, MIS system, and operations&#13;
research. A full-time Program Director dedicated solely to the management of the NTP&#13;
has been appointed by the MOHFW and would be the primary manager of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
4.24   Role of the National Tuberculosis Control Board. This advisory Board would be&#13;
chaired by the Union Health Secretary with the Director General of Health Services as the&#13;
vice-chair. It would act as an apex body and would be responsible for policy formulation,&#13;
approval of annual implementation plans, approval of budgets and allocation of&#13;
resources, coordination with other GOI departments, and evaluation of program&#13;
objectives and achievements. The purpose of this body would be to promote an&#13;
integrated approach to TB control nationwide. The Board would include staff from the&#13;
main TB Research and Training institutes, the private and NGO sectors and&#13;
representatives of donor organizations as members.&#13;
4.25   Role of the State Tuberculosis Control Cell. (See para. 3.31 above.) The State&#13;
Cell would be responsible for the implementation of the project at the state level and for&#13;
ensuring coordination and integration of the program with relevant institutions, including&#13;
medical colleges. The State TB Cell would be supported by a Tuberculosis Coordinating&#13;
Committee responsible for periodic program reviews.&#13;
4.26  Role of the District Tuberculosis Center (DTC). (See para. 3.33 above.) The&#13;
District Tuberculosis Center (DTC) is the most important implementation unit at the&#13;
District level and is responsible for the overall success of the project in the district,&#13;
including:(a) training and direct supervision of the staff of the sub-district Tuberculosis&#13;
Units; (b) consolidating and maintaining patient records by cohorts; (c) providing&#13;
technical assistance to all health facilities offering TB services; and (d) coordinating TB&#13;
activities with NGOs and the private sector, maintaining quality control, and reporting&#13;
project outcomes to the state cell.&#13;
4.27   Role of the District Societies. The District Tuberculosis Society (see para. 3.35&#13;
above) would be responsible for ensuring availability of funds for payment of honoraria,&#13;
contractual services, laboratory supplies, selected IEC activities and maintenance&#13;
expenses, including petrol, oil and lubricants (POL) for vehicles. It has been agreed that&#13;
in those districts where a District Leprosy Society or other Health Society is in operation,&#13;
the charter could be modified to expand its activities to include TB control.&#13;
Alternatively, a new District TB Society would be formed. As already established, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
Societies would be chaired by the District Collector and the District TB Officer (DTO),&#13;
assigned to the District TB Center would act as Secretary for the Society. Half of the&#13;
Society's membership would be comprised of representatives from NGOs and the private&#13;
sector. Both as Secretary of the Society and as the main officer for TB control, the DTO,&#13;
under the District Chief Medical Officer, would be responsible for the appropriate&#13;
implementation of the project at the district and sub-district levels and for integrating the&#13;
TB activities in the district with general health services, including the involvement of the&#13;
NGOs and the private sector. Annex 8 provides details on the District TB Societies.&#13;
4.28  Role of the Tuberculosis Units (TUs). (See para. 3.33 above.) The TB Units at&#13;
the sub-district level comprised of a Senior TB Laboratory Supervisor (STLS) and a&#13;
Senior TB Supervisor (STS), would play a critical role in ensuring project success as their&#13;
key responsibility is to ensure quality control for laboratory work, case management, and&#13;
patient registration and reporting at the peripheral level where treatment services would&#13;
be provided.&#13;
4.29  Role of the City Corporation. (See para. 3.37 above.) In the City Corporations,&#13;
project implementation would be the responsibility of the TB Officer of the Corporation&#13;
with the technical support from the District TB Officer. They would have joint&#13;
responsibility for the implementation of the project, with the MO providing the&#13;
managerial supervision of the staff and the DTO providing the technical supervision and&#13;
advice on the program.&#13;
4.30 Role of WHO in the Project. Starting with the 1992 Program Review, WHO has&#13;
collaborated with the Government of India and with the IDA project team, having played&#13;
a pivotal role in the design and preparation of the project. As a co-financer of technical&#13;
assistance under the project, WHO's important role would continue during&#13;
implementation. Specifically, WHO would assist the National Program by:(a) providing&#13;
TB technical assistance through a TB Advisor stationed in Delhi; (b) facilitating the&#13;
implementation of drug quality control; and (c) providing technical support and advice to&#13;
IDA, GOI and the state governments in project management and evaluation.&#13;
E. Status of Project Development&#13;
4.31   The project is at an advanced stage of preparation having already initiated&#13;
implementation through the pilot projects. The preparation of this project followed the&#13;
1992 Program Review conducted by the Government of India with support from WHO&#13;
and the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) as described in Annex 4.&#13;
4.32  Pilot Projects. Project preparation has centered around the implementation of 15&#13;
pilot projects with financing from a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance approved&#13;
by IDA on November 30, 1993 and launched in February, 1994. The purpose of the&#13;
pilots was to test the revised strategy in different Indian settings and improve the capacity&#13;
of the Central TB Division to implement a new TB control program. As indicated in&#13;
para. 2.13 above, a first set of pilots (Phase I) was financed by SIDA with WHO technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
assistance and they demonstrated successful outcomes under the revised strategy;&#13;
however, there were logistical and managerial obstacles that remained to be tested. The&#13;
Phase II pilots under the PPF were initiated with the purpose of correcting the errors&#13;
found during Phase I and pave the way for an expansion of the revised strategy in several&#13;
states.&#13;
4.33 The results of the pilot projects have been promising having achieved cure rates of&#13;
more than 80% and significant improvement in diagnosis, including increasing numbers&#13;
of female patients, better case management, patient registration, and cohort analysis.&#13;
Similarly, the Central TB Division has been considerably strengthened with the addition&#13;
of new staff who have been actively involved both in the implementation of the pilots as&#13;
well as in the preparation of the proposed project. Annex II provides a summary of the&#13;
Pilot Projects.&#13;
4.34 Technical and Operational Guidelines. Training Modules and Procurement&#13;
Packages. With the experience gained through the pilots, the Central Division staff made&#13;
successive changes in the technical and operational guidelines, in training curricula and&#13;
plans, monitoring and supervision strategies, technical specifications for inputs,&#13;
procurement arrangements, and drug storage and distribution. The technical and&#13;
operational guidelines have been reviewed by IDA and are ready to be issued; several of&#13;
the training modules have been tested and are being finalized.&#13;
4.35  Comprehensive Project Proposal. Based on this accumulated experience and a&#13;
series of joint field visits with IDA missions, the Ministry of Health submitted to IDA, a&#13;
comprehensive project proposal on which most of this Staff Appraisal Report is based.&#13;
The proposal was prepared in close consultation with the State government and District&#13;
Administration and on the basis of other preparatory studies carried out during project&#13;
preparation, including two social assessments, an operational research study on private&#13;
physicians conducted by WHO with ODA funding, and a series of preparatory workshops&#13;
with state and district officials, NGOs and representatives of the Indian Medical&#13;
Association. The participatory approach used in the design of this project is described in&#13;
Annex 22.&#13;
4.36  Social Assessments (SAs). Two social assessments of tuberculosis in India were&#13;
carried out with support from a PHRD Japanese Grant and funds from the Dutch Trust&#13;
Fund. The studies focused in urban areas and in selected tribal areas of five states, where&#13;
TB has become a problem for the last few decades. The assessments provided a wealth of&#13;
qualitative data regarding health providers and patients' attitudes and behavior towards&#13;
TB and other social factors that affect program success. They identified five major&#13;
factors affecting program effectiveness. First, poverty appears to be the single most&#13;
important determinant of poor treatment compliance; second, the social stigma attached&#13;
to TB, which is more common in urban areas, promotes a culture of secrecy and&#13;
misinformation both on the part of the physician and on the part of the patient; third, TB&#13;
control is affected by the lack of a constituency; four, patients have a marked preference&#13;
for private providers for a variety of reasons, including privacy; and fifth, the quality of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
provider-patient interaction has a significant effect on the patient's disposition to continue&#13;
treatment. The findings of the SAs were instrumental in the formulation of an effective&#13;
strategy for the information, education and communication component of the project and&#13;
for the development of the strategy to reach tribal populations. Annex 16 summarizes the&#13;
key findings of the two social assessments and their differences and similarities which&#13;
served as the basis for the Social Indicators described in Annex 17.&#13;
4.37  Building a Constituency: One of the major difficulties encountered in the&#13;
preparation of this project and shown by the social assessments was the lack of&#13;
constituency for tuberculosis control due in part to the stigma attached to it and the lack&#13;
of visible manifestations that may elicit compassion such as leprosy or blindness. The&#13;
successful implementation of the pilot projects and the participatory approach to project&#13;
development served to build enthusiasm and commitment toward the program which led&#13;
to a rise in demand for a rapid expansion of the revised strategy. As a result, the project&#13;
scope which was originally limited to 15 states was changed to allow for wider&#13;
participation of districts throughout the country provided they meet the eligibility criteria&#13;
to enter the RNTP.&#13;
4.38  An International Partnership. The preparation of this project benefited from a&#13;
joint international partnership with the Government of India and the IDA team. WHO&#13;
played a central advisory role, which was complemented by technical advice from&#13;
officials from the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC), the International Union&#13;
Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (IUATLD), the U.S. National Institutes of&#13;
Health (NIH), the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the New York&#13;
City TB Control program. The British Overseas Development Administration (ODA)&#13;
was a full partner in the project preparation both as co-financer of the Phase II pilots and&#13;
as technical advisor.&#13;
4.39  NGO and Private Sector Involvement. Project preparation included a series of&#13;
meetings and workshops with major NGOs in India to exchange views and develop a&#13;
joint plan of action to benefit from their involvement in the National Tuberculosis&#13;
Control Project. With support from the Japanese Grant, INMED (International Medical&#13;
Services for Health), an international NGO with extensive experience in building&#13;
partnerships with the NGO and private sector, worked closely with the Government of&#13;
India, IDA and key NGOs in developing a framework for NGO participation. The role of&#13;
NGOs in tuberculosis in India is quite varied and their participation would reflect those&#13;
differences. Discussions and workshops were also held with representatives from the&#13;
Indian Medical Association in Delhi and in different states. Both NGOs and some private&#13;
physicians are already participating in the pilot projects. Annex 23 provides a brief&#13;
summary of the initial plan of action developed by the MOHFW to facilitate the&#13;
participation of NGOs in the program. The plan was based on the conclusions of&#13;
workshops carried out with NGOs.&#13;
4.40  Environmental Aspects. The proposed project would not present any major&#13;
environmental concerns. The newly developed guidelines for disposal of medical waste,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
which are being strictly followed in the pilot projects, would also apply to the proposed&#13;
project. The laboratory guidelines seek to reduce the risk of individual and&#13;
environmental contamination by detailing the proper and safe handling, collection,&#13;
storage, transportation and disposal of sputum containers, sputum slides and other&#13;
laboratory supplies. The guidelines are an integral part of the training manual for&#13;
laboratory technicians.&#13;
4.41 Tribal3 Populations. Malnutrition is prevalent in tribal areas, posing increased&#13;
risk of TB for tribal populations. Their general isolation and socio-cultural characteristics&#13;
call for a special plan of action to make TB service accessible to tribals. The social&#13;
assessment conducted in tribal areas served to develop the Action Plan to deliver services&#13;
to the tribal populations in adherence to OD 4.20. A summary of the Plan of Action is&#13;
included in Annex 15. The major feature of the plan is the emphasis on the development&#13;
of local resources through training to carry out many aspects of the program and on&#13;
promoting culturally-sensitive communication between patients and service providers.&#13;
At negotiations, the Government of India provided assurances that it would implement&#13;
the strategy in tribal areas in accordance with the Plan of Action for Delivery of&#13;
Tuberculosis Services in Tribal Areas approved by IDA, and would furnish detailed plans&#13;
to implement the strategy in tribal areas as part of the eligibility criteria for a district's&#13;
participation in the RNTP.&#13;
F.    ProJect Monitoring&#13;
4.42   Measurable indicators for quality control, clinical outcomes, and operational&#13;
effectiveness have been agreed with the Government and they are part of the operational&#13;
and technical guidelines (Annex 1). They are also included in Table 4.4 on performance&#13;
indicators on page 38 and would be the basis for project monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
Annex 19 provides a summary of objectives, inputs, and expected outcomes of the&#13;
project.&#13;
4.43   Project monitoring at the national level would be done through reviews of&#13;
quarterly reports collected from the periphery by the District TB Center and through&#13;
regular supervisory visits and spot checks by state, regional and central level officials.&#13;
Regional consultants hired by the central division would provide quarterly reports from&#13;
their field visits highlighting major obstacles for project progress. The supervisory and&#13;
monitoring functions of the Central Division are described in Annex 20. In addition,&#13;
the Central and the State Training Institutes would carry out regular supervisory visits&#13;
of laboratory and treatment facilities for quality control. Similarly, annual drug quality&#13;
control analysis would be carried out by independent laboratories as well as an&#13;
independent annual audit of the drug procurement and distribution system. Annual&#13;
social assessments to measure the social indicators described in Annex 17 would be&#13;
carried out starting on the second year of the project.&#13;
3 "Tribal" is the formal term used in the Indian Constitution to refer to indigenous groups who are currently living or&#13;
have emigrated from isolated and remote areas and have distinctive social, cultural and economic characteristics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
4.44   During negotiations, the Government of India provided assurances that it would&#13;
carry out an annual assessment of the drug procurement, storage and distribution system&#13;
through an independent agency acceptable to IDA.&#13;
4.45   At the state and city levels, monitoring would include monthly meetings with&#13;
district program coordinators followed by immediate feedback to the service providers.&#13;
The District TB Officers would supervise district activities according to pre-established&#13;
schedules and indicators.&#13;

4.46  The proposed project would finance annual review workshops with state, city and&#13;
District project officers. Operational research findings would help evaluate and improve&#13;
program activities.&#13;
4.47  In addition to bi-annual project review missions, operational and technical&#13;
reviews would be carried out every two years to assess project implementation and make&#13;
the necessary adjustments. A comprehensive project review by a panel of international&#13;
and national technical experts agreeable to IDA, including WHO Global Tuberculosis&#13;
Program representatives, would be carried out within two and half years of the project to&#13;
assess the progress made in the introduction of the revised strategy and make the&#13;
necessary adjustments in the project design and determine the possibilities of expansion&#13;
of the RNTP beyond the 102 districts, under a separate intervention. This review would&#13;
serve as the basis for IDA's mid-term review of the project.&#13;
4.48  During negotiations, the Government of India provided assurances that it would&#13;
carry out an independent review of the Project within the first two and a half years of the&#13;
Project and that the reviews would be conducted by a panel of national and international&#13;
experts; and the findings of such review would be furnished to the Association, and that&#13;
no later than December 31, 1999, the GOI and IDA would carry out a mid-term&#13;
management review and thereafter will implement its recommendations.&#13;
4.49 IDA Supervision Plan. WHO, in collaboration with the World Bank, would&#13;
assign a TB expert to Delhi. The main focus of the Advisor's duties would be to provide&#13;
guidance and advice to the program and facilitate project implementation. The work of&#13;
the TB Advisor would be complemented with periodic project review missions by IDA&#13;
which would be based on progress reports submitted by the TB division every six&#13;
months. IDA supervision teams would seek collaboration from WHO, CDC, IUATLD&#13;
and national technical experts for program review missions. A Bank local staff member&#13;
assigned to the Delhi office would carry out periodic visits to project sites, in&#13;
combination with other assignments, to identify major bottlenecks in project&#13;
implementation and would do periodic follow up of issues regarding, procurement,&#13;
disbursements and auditing. The planned schedule and skills required for project&#13;
supervision are listed in Annex 21.&#13;
4.50  Supervision missions would focus primarily on specific benchmarks related to the&#13;
Performance Monitoring Indicators described in Annex 19 and on the technical and&#13;
operational indicators described in Table 4.4 above.&#13;
&#13;

G.    Disbursements&#13;
4.51    The principles on which disbursement arrangements have been developed&#13;
include: (a) the adequate training of project staff in Bank procedures and the appropriate&#13;
mechanisms in the project sites, states and cities and the Center to ensure that&#13;
differentials between project implementation and disbursement performance are reduced;&#13;
and (b) adequate and appropriate mechanisms to ensure the flow of funds from the Center&#13;
to the project states and cities and the District Societies and to project sites and to ensure&#13;
that project funds are used exclusively for agreed project-related expenditures and&#13;
purposes.&#13;
4.52   Disbursement Percentages. The disbursement plan has taken into account the fact&#13;
that purchases would be made to support the entire tuberculosis control activities as&#13;
summarized in Table 3.1 on page 11, including those that would have been funded by&#13;
GOI in any case. Accordingly, disbursement percentages have been set at levels&#13;
necessary to ensure that the IDA credit provides funds amounting to 86% of the&#13;
incremental cost only. Thus, The IDA credit would be disbursed in accordance with&#13;
Table 4.5 below.&#13;

4.54 Required Documentation. Disbursement for procurement of goods and works&#13;
under contracts valued at less than US$200,000 and services under contracts valued at&#13;
less than US$100,000 per firm (US$50,000 per individual contract), maintenance of&#13;
equipment and vehicles and salaries of incremental staff would be made against&#13;
Statements of Expenses (SOEs), with supporting documentation to be retained by each&#13;
state government. This documentation would be subject to annual audit and made&#13;
available for review by IDA supervision missions. All other disbursements would be&#13;
made against fully documented withdrawal applications. During negotiations, the&#13;
Government of India provided assurances that no disbursements would be made for&#13;
expenditures incurred in, or by, any Project State unless that Project State has delivered to&#13;
the Association, a Letter of Undertaking of such Project State, satisfactory to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
Association.&#13;
4.55   Special Account. In order to accelerate disbursements with respect to IDA's share&#13;
of expenditures pre-financed by GOI and the state govemments, and to allow for the&#13;
direct payment of other local and foreign expenditures, a Special Account would be&#13;
maintained in the Reserve Bank of India in the amount of US$6.5 million equivalent to&#13;
cover four months of estimated disbursements through the Special Account.&#13;
4.56  Flow of Funds. The direct disbursement of funds to the District Societies for&#13;
operating expenses has been tested in the pilots and found to work. The items eligible for&#13;
disbursement through the District Societies have been identified (e.g., honoraria, lab&#13;
supplies and consumables, small civil works, operation and maintenance costs, training&#13;
funds, and limited publicity expenses). Funds for salaries, and selected goods would be&#13;
disbursed to the states and cities. GOI would monitor closely the use of funds by the&#13;
states, cities and District Societies. No other funds would be disbursed to the District&#13;
Societies as the MOH would be responsible for procurement of most drugs, equipment&#13;
and supplies.&#13;
H.   Procurement&#13;
4.57  Table 4.7 on page 43 summarizes the project items, their related cost estimates&#13;
and proposed methods of procurement. Project related procurement of goods, works and&#13;
services would follow procedures acceptable to IDA using ICB and NCB documents&#13;
acceptable to the Associations. Procurement of drugs and microscopes would be carried&#13;
out by the Procurement Unit at the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare during the first&#13;
year of the project and a review of its operational effectiveness would be made after the&#13;
first year. Project-financed consultants and NGOs would be recruited according to&#13;
Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers. Procurement of&#13;
laboratory equipment and drugs would be bulked to the extent possible and any&#13;
individual contract exceeding US$200,000 equivalent would be procured under ICB&#13;
procedures.&#13;
4.58  Civil Works (US$4.8 million). The civil works component is dominated by very&#13;
small scale works scattered widely in the project districts. For example, the plans call for&#13;
minor alteration work at 6,517 existing field laboratories, such as installation of electrical&#13;
outlets for microscopes and mounting of exhaust fume hoods. The cost of the works at&#13;
each laboratory site is estimated at approximately US$600. Collectively, these minor&#13;
alteration works constitute over 60% of the civil works covered by the project. At least&#13;
90% of these small alterations would be procured by soliciting quotations from at least&#13;
three contractors to ensure competitive pricing since the small scale and disbursed nature&#13;
of the work does not lend itself to an advertised bidding process. Not more than 10% of&#13;
the small works would be permitted through the use of Force Account. The bulk of the&#13;
remaining civil works involves alterations to existing facilities to create adequate storage&#13;
room at the District levels to accommodate several months supply of TB drugs. A total&#13;

of 104 such storage facilities is planned at a total cost of some US$300,000, or roughly&#13;
US$2,900 at each site. Where possible, construction at these locations would be&#13;
advertised and competitively bid, but when this is not practical, use of force account or&#13;
quotations from three contractors to ensure competitive prices would be permissible.&#13;
4.59 Drugs (US$8 1.6 million). Procurement of drugs for the project would be&#13;
primarily a centrally managed activity performed by the MOH, and phased on an annual&#13;
basis throughout the life of the project in accordance with the requirements of the project&#13;
activities as additional districts are brought into the TB Control Program. Details on&#13;
drugs purchasing and distribution are described in Annex 24. Initial drug purchases&#13;
would be through the use of Bank Standard Bidding Documents and ICB Procedures to&#13;
supply multi-drug packs in blister pack containers. Technical and commercial&#13;
specifications for this type of purchase have already been successfully tested during the&#13;
Phase II Pilot. Commencing year two of the project, consideration would be given to&#13;
introducing Combination Drugs. Technical specifications for Combination Drugs are still&#13;
under review with GOI and WHO, however, any such large scale procurement would also&#13;
be conducted using ICB procedures. Prior to the extensive use of Combination Drugs,&#13;
some operational research is anticipated, and to support this activity a limited amount of&#13;
International Shopping would be permitted, not to exceed US$1.0 million, to obtain the&#13;
necessary combination of drugs from the relatively few manufacturers in the world who&#13;
are known to be providers of these specialized drugs. All significant purchases of fixed&#13;
combination drugs would be subject to bioavailability tests at independent WHO&#13;
approved laboratories. In summary, the majority of purchases of the TB drugs would be&#13;
procured by the Center in contracts valued over US$200,000 using ICB procedures for a&#13;
total amount not exceeding US$72.4 million. Contracts for TB and supportive drugs&#13;
valued at US$200,000 or less would be procured through NCB procedures acceptable to&#13;
IDA for an aggregate amount not exceeding US$8.2 million, and an additional US$ 1.0&#13;
million in drug purchases would be permitted under international shopping procedures.&#13;
4.60  Laboratory equipment (US$12.9 million). Procurement of most of the laboratory&#13;
equipment would be phased on an annual basis over the first three years of the project in&#13;
accordance with the requirements of the project activities. Over 90% of the costs for&#13;
laboratory equipment involves the purchase of binocular microscopes, with the remainder&#13;
for centrifuge devices, refrigerators, or similar small scale laboratory appliances. Bulk&#13;
purchases of the microscopes and other laboratory equipment would be procured by the&#13;
Center in contracts valued over US$200,000 using ICB procedures for a total amount not&#13;
exceeding US$10.9 million. Contracts valued at US$200,000 or less would be procured&#13;
through NCB procedures acceptable to IDA for an aggregate amount not exceeding&#13;
US$1.3 million. For purchases not exceeding US$100,000, procurement would be&#13;
through rate contracts or local shopping procedures, comparing price quotations from at&#13;
least three suppliers to ensure competitive prices up to an aggregate amount not&#13;
exceeding US$0.6 million.&#13;
4.61  Other goods or equipment (US$5.0 million). Procurement of other equipment&#13;
would be phased on an annual basis over the first four years of the project in accordance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
with the requirements of the project activities as additional districts meet eligibility&#13;
criteria and initiate new activities. Over 60% of the costs for laboratory equipment&#13;
involves the purchase of small computers and peripherals, with the remainder for audio&#13;
visual equipment, photocopiers, FAX machines and other office equipment. Purchases of&#13;
this equipment would be bulked whenever possible and purchased at the State level.&#13;
Contracts valued at US$200,000 or less would be procured through NCB procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA for an aggregate amount not exceeding US$2.0 million. For purchases&#13;
not exceeding US$ 100,000, procurement would be through rate contracts or local&#13;
shopping procedures, comparing price quotations from at least three suppliers to ensure&#13;
competitive prices up to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$3.0 million.&#13;
4.62  Vehicles (US$3.1 million). Procurement of vehicles would be phased on an&#13;
annual basis over the entire five years of the project in accordance with the requirements&#13;
of the project activities as additional districts are brought into the RNTP. Over 50% of&#13;
the costs for vehicles would be for the purchase of jeeps to be used at the state and&#13;
District Headquarters, and the bulk of the remaining costs for some 537 two wheeler&#13;
vehicles for transportation at the sub-District levels. Because the project involves more&#13;
than fifteen states spaced over a five year period, and the total requirement for jeeps is&#13;
roughly 237 vehicles, no contract is expected to contain more than ten vehicles. Such a&#13;
purchasing plan does not lend itself to ICB. Wherever possible, requirements would be&#13;
bulked at the state level and purchased through NCB procedures. For purchases not&#13;
exceeding US$100,000, procurement would be through DGS&amp;D rate contracts or local&#13;
shopping procedures, comparing price quotations from at least three suppliers to ensure&#13;
competitive prices up to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$3.1 million.&#13;
4.63  Laboratory supplies (US$24.1 million). Procurement of laboratory supplies&#13;
would be phased on a quarterly or semi-annual basis throughout the life of the project in&#13;
accordance with the requirements of the project activities. The supplies required include&#13;
such items as glass microscope slides, slide storage cases, reagents, and sputum cups.&#13;
Efficient purchasing, storage, and distribution of this type of material to over 6,500 lab&#13;
sites does not lend itself to bulking of requirements for ICB. With the exception of&#13;
chemical reagents, where quality control is a concern, bulking requirements for purchase&#13;
through NCB is also not a practical solution. Nevertheless, purchases of laboratory&#13;
supplies would be bulked whenever possible and procured at the State level in contracts&#13;
valued at US$200,000 or less through NCB procedures acceptable to IDA for an&#13;
aggregate amount not exceeding US$2.4 million. For small purchases not exceeding&#13;
US$100,000, procurement would be through DGS&amp;D rate contracts or local shopping&#13;
procedures, comparing price quotations from at least three suppliers to ensure competitive&#13;
prices up to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$21.7 million.&#13;
4.64  Consultancies. Support to NGOs and Social Marketing (US$6.1 million).&#13;
Consultants required under the project would be hired following procedures prescribed in&#13;
the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers. Documents used for&#13;
inviting proposals, terms of reference for all consultancies and single source contracts&#13;
would be subject to prior review for all contracts valued at US$100,000 or more awarded&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
to firms and US$50,000 or more to be awarded to individuals. Publicity services for mass&#13;
media would be procured by GOI and the states from the Ministry of Information's radio&#13;
and television stations. The rates that would be used would not exceed the standard rate&#13;
of charges to other advertisers. Informational spots directed at the private sector health&#13;
providers would also be provided in professional trade journals or similar publications&#13;
through direct contracting at existing commercial rates.&#13;
4.65  Training. Workshops &amp; Fellowships (US$6.5 million). This category includes&#13;
expenses related to training of about 235,000 health and other project staff over the life of&#13;
the project in respect of seminars, workshops, fellowships, travel and subsistence&#13;
allowances.&#13;
4.67  Vehicle and Equipment Maintenance (US$3.2 million). Maintenance costs for&#13;
vehicles, laboratory and other equipment items estimated to cost less than US$25,000 per&#13;
contract up to an aggregate amount of US$3.2 million would be procured from local&#13;
commercial suppliers of such services in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
4.68  IDA Review. All procurement under ICB would be subject to IDA's prior&#13;
review; the first three NCB contracts for goods in each state, regardless of size, would&#13;
also be subject to prior review. All other contracts for goods would be subject to random&#13;
post review in the field by IDA visiting missions. Contracts for the hiring of consulting&#13;
firms costing US$100,000 equivalent or more and contracts for hiring individual&#13;
consultants costing US$50,000 equivalent or more would be subject to prior review and&#13;
approval by IDA. Approximately 65% of the value of contracts covered by the IDA&#13;
Credit would require prior review. During negotiations, the Government of India&#13;
provided assurances that no equipment, drugs or vehicles purchased with proceeds of the&#13;
credit would be provided to any state which has not furnished a Letter of Undertaking&#13;
with the central government.&#13;
1.    Accounting and Auditing&#13;
4.69     Expenditures incurred by the Center and by each participating state and city&#13;
corporation, including the District TB Societies, would be audited annually in accordance&#13;
with sound auditing standards consistently applied by independent and qualified auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA; District Societies are to be audited by independent chartered&#13;
accountants; and certified copies of the annual financial statements and SOEs together&#13;
with the auditor's report, which would comment separately on the SOEs, would be&#13;
submitted to IDA no later than six months after the close of each fiscal year. The Central&#13;
Government would maintain a separate account for the IDA assisted Program. At the&#13;
Center, State, District and city levels, a record of program transactions would be&#13;
maintained with appropriate supporting documentation for the transactions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

V. Benefits and Risks&#13;
A.    Benefits&#13;
5.1   It is expected that by introducing a new paradigm for TB control and focusing on&#13;
the most infectious cases with appropriate diagnosis and treatment under direct&#13;
observation, the project would begin to reverse the trend of several years of sub-optimal&#13;
program results which has led to increased numbers of TB cases as well as the emergence&#13;
of drug-resistant strains. It is estimated that the project would treat about three million&#13;
TB cases in five years of which about 1.9 million would be treated under the revised&#13;
strategy, including about 800,000 new smear-positive cases. If the project objective of&#13;
85% cure rate is achieved, approximately 1.5 million infectious TB patients would be&#13;
cured. In addition, many more millions of non-infected individuals would potentially be&#13;
freed from the risk of TB infection and the development of TB disease. The most&#13;
concrete benefit of the project is that it would avoid an estimated 140,000 deaths from TB&#13;
per year. This is especially important considering that the TB burden adversely impacts&#13;
the most economically and socially productive members of Indian society, the 15-44 year&#13;
old age group. Moreover, the changes introduced by the project are likely to improve&#13;
awareness about TB among the community and improve detection and treatment among&#13;
private physicians who play an important role in TB care.&#13;
B.    Program Objective Categories&#13;
5.2   Poverty Aspects. TB is a disease of poverty, having higher prevalence among the&#13;
undernourished, rural migrants and those living in crowded conditions. Improving the&#13;
socio-economic status of the people may be the most effective way of preventing TB, but&#13;
in the short term, the best prevention of TB remains the detection and cure of infectious&#13;
cases. The project would benefit primarily the poor who are most susceptible to the&#13;
disease. The social assessments demonstrated that a major barrier in TB control is the&#13;
financial constraints of the poor to pay for the medicines, transportation or doctor's fees&#13;
and the poor were the bigger users of government facilities. The proposed project would&#13;
reduce these barriers by making diagnosis and treatment more accessible, by involving&#13;
the community and by providing for free and uninterrupted supply of anti-TB medicines,&#13;
thereby increasing the credibility of the Government's TB health care system. Because of&#13;
its special focus on the poor, this project is classified as a Program of Targeted&#13;
Interventions (PTI).&#13;
5.3   Gender Issues. Reported TB prevalence among women is lower than among men&#13;
worldwide, but opinions vary among TB specialist as to whether this is an&#13;
epidemiological factor or simply the result of under-diagnosis of female patients because&#13;
of lack of access or because of the stigma associated with TB. In any case, TB mortality&#13;
rate among women of child-bearing age is disproportionately higher than among men.&#13;
The social assessments and other literature on TB in India show that women are the main&#13;
victims of the stigma associated with TB. Women's seclusion and lower social status,&#13;
particularly in poor rural areas, make it difficult for them to comply with treatment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
Similarly, women tend to seek treatment often at advanced stages of the disease, making&#13;
treatment more complicated and sometimes unsuccessful. The proposed project would&#13;
promote the formation of support groups at the community level, include special training&#13;
and communication models to raise awareness of women's issues concerning TB among&#13;
service providers and develop IEC interventions to reduce the stigma associated with TB&#13;
in general. The results of the Phase II pilots are promising regarding the treatment of&#13;
women but a frequent and structured approach is needed to keep the momentum and raise&#13;
awareness of the issues of women's health and TB. The cohort analysis allows&#13;
supervisors to monitor the effectiveness of the project in reaching women. After the&#13;
second year of the project, bi-annual beneficiary assessments would be conducted to&#13;
assess the effect of the project among the most disadvantaged groups and based on the&#13;
social indicators described in Annex 17.&#13;
C.    Risks and Safeguards&#13;
5.4   Most of the common risks associated with PHR projects in India such as&#13;
procurement, late disbursement, inadequate maintenance of equipment, and the software&#13;
aspects have been considerably minimized by the experience and commitment gained&#13;
through the pilot projects. Nonetheless, the project presents other risks, most typically&#13;
associated with TB control and the introduction of a new program. These include:(a) the&#13;
risk of significant variation between the estimated number of cases and the actual cases&#13;
due to the fact that firm information on TB incidence in India is not available; (b) the&#13;
inherent risks of a shift in technological and behavioral practices, particularly the&#13;
difficulties of persuading providers and patients to accept the practice of directly&#13;
observed treatment and the rigorous features of the DOTS strategy; (c) the risk of poorly&#13;
administered short-course chemotherapy drugs and of poor quality anti-TB drugs which&#13;
would increase the probabilities of developing drug resistance; (d) the risk that the&#13;
Central and State TB Cells would be unable to provide the leadership and services&#13;
required to ensure proper implementation of the program given the scope, the managerial&#13;
complexity of the revised strategy, and the need to maintain an active constituency for TB&#13;
control in the government and the community; (e) the risk of an uneven supply of drugs&#13;
in light of the spotty record of drug deliveries in India combined with the availability of&#13;
large quantities of drugs which could be misused; (f) the risk that the project would not&#13;
succeed in influencing the private providers in changing their TB practices and patients&#13;
would continue to rely on their services for reasons of privacy if the public sector does&#13;
not deliver as expected; and (g) the continuous challenge of dealing with mobile migrant&#13;
populations, particularly in urban slum settings.&#13;
5.5   The estimates of TB incidence in India are based on the best information available&#13;
at present; however, to ensure greater accuracy on the quantitative objectives, the mid-&#13;
term review would be used to make a readjustment of the project objectives, as needed,&#13;
based on the actual experience of the project. This would reduce the risk associated with&#13;
possible inaccuracies on case estimates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
5.6   The Phases I and II pilots implemented as part of project preparation have helped&#13;
to identify the risks associated with the new approach and to find ways to mitigate them.&#13;
They have also provided the Central Unit in the Ministry of Health (MOH) with hands-on&#13;
experience in running the new program, understanding the demands and constraints&#13;
involved and having the opportunity to make corrections as the project progressed.&#13;
Although the Program's scope is large, the possibility of expanding the revised strategy&#13;
to wider geographical areas has generated enthusiasm and greater commitment among&#13;
government officials, the medical associations, and other groups. Similarly, the efforts to&#13;
involve the private sector and the NGOs are beginning to pay off.&#13;
5.7   The introduction of an appropriate Management Information System (MIS) would&#13;
help keep adequate control of registration and patient records, including mobile&#13;
populations; and a decentralized approach to treatment with the involvement of the&#13;
community would facilitate the implementation of DOT. Interruption in the drug supply&#13;
would be minimized through buffer stocks and monitored through annual independent&#13;
audits of the drug inventory, distribution and utilization. Quality control of anti-TB drugs&#13;
would be monitored through independent scientific institutions in addition to the standard&#13;
government procedures. The packaging of drugs in multi-drug blister packs and per-&#13;
patient treatment boxes, as well as the introduction of multi-drug combination pills at a&#13;
later stage would help reduce mishandling of medicines. Finally, it is expected that the&#13;
collaboration planned between the government and the private practitioners would help&#13;
improve the effectiveness of TB control in both the public and private sectors.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 1&#13;
INDIA: Tuberculosis Control Project&#13;
SUMMARY FROM THE TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES&#13;
REVISED NATIONAL TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL PROGRAM&#13;
Diagnosis&#13;
1.    Diagnosis is done through passive case finding, i.e., patients who present themselves&#13;
to a tuberculosis clinic, and through sputum examination, i.e., three sputum samples per&#13;
patient, one taken on the day of the visit, a second overnight and a third on the following&#13;
day.&#13;
2.    For diagnostic purposes, Pulmonary Tuberculosis is classified into Pulmonary Smear&#13;
Positive, Pulmonary Smear Negative and Extra-Pulmonary Tuberculosis.&#13;
3.    Pulmonary Smear Positive patients are those with at least two sputum specimens&#13;
positive for the Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) by microscopy; or those with one positive sputum&#13;
specimen and radiographic abnormalities consistent with active pulmonary tuberculosis.&#13;
4.    Pulmonary Smear Negative patients are those with three sputum specimens negative&#13;
for the AFB by microscopy and radiographic abnormalities consistent with active pulmonary&#13;
tuberculosis (i.e., a changing chest radiograph) and decision by a physician to treat with a&#13;
full curative course of anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy. In case of pediatric tuberculosis, the&#13;
decision of the physician to treat with full course of chemotherapy is sufficient.&#13;
5.    Extra-Pulmonary Tuberculosis patients are those with a history and/or clinical&#13;
evidence consistent with active tuberculosis and a decision by a physician to treat with a full&#13;
curative course of anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy.&#13;
Treatment History&#13;
6.    To determine the treatment regimen to be followed, tuberculosis patients are&#13;
classified according to their treatment history: new, relapse, failure, default, or chronic.&#13;
7.    A new case is a patient who has never taken anti-tuberculosis drugs in the past, or&#13;
one who has had less than four weeks of treatment.&#13;
8.    A relapse case is a patient, who was previously treated and declared cured by a&#13;
physician, but is found to be smear positive.&#13;
9.    A failure case consists of four sub-categories: (a) a new smear positive pulmonary&#13;
tuberculosis patient on short course chemotherapy (SCC) who remains sputum smear&#13;
positive after 5 months, or more, of SCC; or (b) a retreatment case in which a patient remains&#13;
smear positive after completing a full course of chemotherapy; or (c) a smear negative&#13;
patient, at the start of treatment, becomes smear positive at two months from start of&#13;
treatment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54-&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
10.   A default case is a patient who interrupts treatment for two months or more.&#13;
11.   A chronic case is a patient who remains smear positive after completing a&#13;
retreatment regimen.&#13;
Short Course Chemotherapy Treatment Regimen&#13;
12.    Category I patients are new cases of smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis and other&#13;
newly diagnosed smear negative but seriously ill patients with severe forms of tuberculosis.&#13;
These have the highest priority in SCC due to infectiousness.&#13;
13.    The initial intensive phase is 2(HRZE)3, i.e., isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R),&#13;
pyrazinamide (Z) and ethambutol (E) in a blister pack, administered three (3) times a week&#13;
for two (2) months, under Directly Observed Therapy (DOT).&#13;
14.   If after the two months initial intensive phase the patient is smear negative, then the 4&#13;
months continuation phase follows. If after the two months initial intensive phase the patient&#13;
is smear positive, the two month intensive phase is extended to another month of thrice a&#13;
week DOT of HRZE, after which the continuation phase will commence regardless of&#13;
sputum test results. If the patient remains smear positive at three months and is put on the&#13;
continuation phase, his/her sputum is examined after two months, i.e., month 5, and if still&#13;
smear positive, the patient is categorized as a failure case and started on the retreatment&#13;
regimen.&#13;
15.   The continuation phase is 4(HR)3, i.e., isoniazid and rifampicin in a blister pack,&#13;
administered three times a week for four months. A blister calendar pack for one week&#13;
treatment is given to the patient and at least the first dose should be directly observed at the&#13;
time of collection. On the next collection, the patient should return the empty blisters.&#13;
16.    Category II or Retreatment patients are those who have received anti-tuberculosis&#13;
treatment for more than one month in the past. They are at an increased risk of developing&#13;
multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis. These include smear positive, relapse and failure&#13;
cases. These are also of high priority in SCC because they are still infectious and under&#13;
suspicion of MDR.&#13;
17.    The initial intensive phase is 2(HRZES)3/l(HRZE)3, i.e., isoniazid, rifampicin,&#13;
pyrazinamide and ethambutol, in a blister pack, supplemented with streptomycin (S),&#13;
administered three times a week, for the first two months, followed by the same drugs,&#13;
without streptomycin, administered three times a week, through DOT, for one month.&#13;
18.   If the patient is smear negative at three months, then the continuation phase is&#13;
started. If the patient is smear positive at three months, then HRZE is continued for another&#13;
month, administered three times a week. If the patient is still smear positive at the end of the&#13;
fourth month, and there is a facility to undertake culture test, then, after stoppage of the&#13;
drugs for three days, sputum samples should be sent for culture and drug sensitivity tests. In&#13;
any case, the patient should begin the continuation phase with a blister calendar pack for&#13;
weekly treatment in which the first dose shall be directly observed at the time of collection.&#13;

activities of different institutions. At the State, the RNTP is supported by a State&#13;
Tuberculosis Officer (STO) and the State Tuberculosis Training Centers. The STO is&#13;
responsible for planning, training, implementing, supervising and monitoring of the RNTP at&#13;
the State level, and coordinating Tuberculosis Control activities with other health institutions&#13;
involved in TB control.&#13;
27.    Diagnosis is made by medical staff (Government, Non-Governmental Organizations&#13;
or NGOs and private clinicians). Patients diagnosed with tuberculosis may be referred to&#13;
government facilities for treatment which is free of charge. Once the patient has been&#13;
diagnosed, treatment is provided by trained health staff at all levels, including the village&#13;
level.&#13;
28.    Upon the advice of health staff, patients may choose their most convenient place to&#13;
receive treatment, e.g., a hospital, a District Tuberculosis Center (DTC), a Community&#13;
Health Center (CHC), a Primary Health Center (PHC).&#13;
29.    Drugs are taken by the patient under DOT during the intensive phase of the treatment&#13;
regimen. During the continuation phase of the treatment regimen, drugs are supplied, in&#13;
blister packs, weekly for self administration, with the dose of the collection day taken under&#13;
DOT.&#13;

Recording and Reporting&#13;
31.    The accurate keeping of records on all individual patients under treatment and&#13;
quarterly reporting of treatment results of all registered new patients and retreatment cases&#13;
by means of a cohort analysis, is essential for reliable continuous evaluation of the RNTP at&#13;
the sub-district, district, state and national levels. The number of documents used in the&#13;
RNTP is limited as much as possible and they are clear and simple. The following records&#13;
are recommended for the revised RNTP:&#13;
(a)    Tuberculosis Treatment Card. A tuberculosis treatment card is filled as soon&#13;
as a diagnosis of tuberculosis is made. It is kept at the health institution&#13;
where the patient receives treatment (either at a TB clinic, DTC, district&#13;
hospital, CHC, PHC, Health Post, etc.). A duplicate of this card is given to&#13;
the most peripheral health functionary who is directly supervising the drug&#13;
administration of the patient who cannot or failed to visit the designated&#13;
treatment health unit at a given time. Information on administration of drugs&#13;
during the initial intensive phase is to be entered on this card and transferred&#13;
on to the main card kept at the health institution by the most peripheral health&#13;
functionary. The Senior Tuberculosis Supervisor (STS) of the Tuberculosis&#13;
Unit (TU) transfers the relevant data, in particular the results of smear&#13;
examinations on entry, at two (three) months, at five months (in retreatment&#13;
cases) and at the end of treatment, from the Tuberculosis Treatment Card to&#13;
the TB Register kept at the sub-district or sub-divisional level.&#13;
(b)    Tuberculosis Identity Card. This card is filled as soon as the diagnosis of&#13;
tuberculosis is made and the Tuberculosis Treatment Card completed. It is&#13;
kept by the patient. The TB Identity Card contains disease classification,&#13;
date treatment started, type of tuberculosis, type of the RNTP regimen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59-&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
(Category 1, 11 or 111), type of a blister pack for the initial intensive phase to&#13;
be closely supervised (DOT), and type of blister pack for the continuation&#13;
phase. Appointment dates for blister packs collection during the continuation&#13;
phase and following examinations are entered on page 2 of the Card.&#13;
(c)    Tuberculosis Register. The Tuberculosis Register is one of the basic&#13;
documents since it contains all essential data on the patient, treatment unit,&#13;
classification of the disease and bacteriological status on entry, type of the&#13;
regimen, date of the start of treatment, type of the patient (new, relapse,&#13;
transferred in, returned after defaulting, failure case), and smear examination&#13;
results during treatment and at its completion. It is kept by the STS who is&#13;
responsible for entering all the required data on all patients enrolled in&#13;
chemotherapy in the sub-district or sub-division. The TB Register is the&#13;
basic document for reporting results of case finding of new cases and relapses&#13;
and treatment results to the DTC by means of the respective quarterly reports.&#13;
It is also necessary for collection of the data as reported in the Quarterly&#13;
Report on Management of the RNTP.&#13;
(d)    Laboratory Register. This Register is kept at all laboratories in the sub-&#13;
district performing sputum smear examinations for AFB. Important&#13;
information is contained in columns "Reason for Examination" and "Results&#13;
of Specimen". The laboratory technician should tick carefully whether the&#13;
sputum was collected for diagnosis (both new patients and relapses) or for&#13;
follow-up of treatment. For diagnosis, three sputa are required, and two&#13;
sputum specimens for follow-up of patients. For follow-up, the patient's TB&#13;
Register Number is written in the column provided. All results of diagnostic&#13;
examination should be entered in the same line.&#13;
(e)    Request Form for Sputum Examination. It is essential that the person who&#13;
completes the form indicates whether the sputum is sent for diagnosis or for&#13;
follow-up. In the former case a detailed address should be given for the&#13;
patient in case he does not return to the health institution and the sputum is&#13;
found to be smear-positive, so that the patient can be traced. This form is&#13;
kept at all health institutions (peripheral, intermediate, central).&#13;
(f)    Tuberculosis Culture/Sensitivity Test Request Form. Request Form for&#13;
culture/sensitivity tests will be sent to central laboratory by Medical Officer&#13;
in case of failure to respond to short course chemotherapy.&#13;
(g)    Tuberculosis Referral/Transfer Form. This form is used when transferring&#13;
patients from one area to another or when referring patients to a referral&#13;
center. It is to be filled in triplicate: one is given to the patient (to hand over&#13;
at the next health institution), one is sent to the health institution directly and&#13;
the other retained for records. The receiving health institution will fill the&#13;
bottom half of the form and return it to the referring or transferring&#13;
institution, as soon as the patient comes to them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60-&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
32.    Quarterly Reporting. All sub-district/subdivisions or ward STSs must submit reports&#13;
on case-finding, and results of treatment to the District TB Officer. The forms to be used&#13;
are:&#13;
(a)    Quarterly Report on New Cases and Relapses.&#13;
(b)    Quarterly Report on the Results of Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis&#13;
Patients registered 12-15 months earlier.&#13;
(c)    Quarterly Report on Program Management.&#13;
33.    These forms are to be completed in triplicate by each sub-district/ward STS: one will be sent to the&#13;
DTO, one to the State TB Officer and the other retained by the STS for the records. The&#13;
forms will be checked by the DTO and submitted promptly to the State TB Officer, where&#13;
the forms are to be collected for prompt submission to the Director TB Control at the&#13;
National level for easy retrieval and production of country reports.&#13;
34.    The two quarterly reports are made in a manner to permit cohort analysis. A cohort&#13;
refers to a group of individuals with a common characteristic; in this case, the cohort&#13;
includes all patients registered in a sub-district/ward during a quarter. The sub-district/ward&#13;
STS is to be trained to be able to prepare accurately these reports. Reliable reports can only&#13;
be produced if the register is kept up to date.&#13;
35.    Quarterly reports No. I and 2 will be computerized at the State and Central level for&#13;
all districts.&#13;
(a)    Quarterly report No. I contains information on new cases and relapses of&#13;
tuberculosis. Block I refers to all patients registered during the last quarter&#13;
by disease classification and bacteriological status (smear-positive, smear-&#13;
negative and extra-pulmonary), and Block 2 refers to only smear-positive&#13;
new cases by age groups and sex.&#13;
The State/Corporation TB officer will analyze the results of case-finding, and&#13;
produce explanatory remarks concerning all districts, in particular the&#13;
detection-rate of new smear-positive cases, the percentage of smear positive&#13;
cases from the total number of detected pulmonary cases, the detection rate&#13;
of smear-positive relapses, and the percentage of extra-pulmonary&#13;
tuberculosis cases. In the report covering all four quarters, rates (per&#13;
100,000) by age and sex will be calculated for new smear-positive cases.&#13;
The figures per district will be compared with the previous years. The&#13;
reports will be distributed to all districts and sub-districts in the division as a&#13;
feedback of case-finding, activities, and will be important background&#13;
information for supervisory visits.&#13;
(b)    Quarterly report No. 2 shows results of treatment of new smear-positive&#13;
cases, smear-negative cases, smear-positive relapses and other re-treatment&#13;
cases in each sub-district/ward, quarterly. The most important index is the&#13;
cure rate (and treatment completion rate) in new smear-positive cases and,&#13;
separately, smear-positive relapses, and other retreatment cases. It is&#13;
expected that in India, with the regimens used, the success rate (the cure plus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61-&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
completion rates) would be 85% (or more) of new smear positive cases. The&#13;
dates for preparing the Quarterly reports indicating the results of the&#13;
treatment (Treatment Outcomes) of patients who started treatment during e.g.&#13;
1997 would be as follows:&#13;
Start of Treatment                        Date of Analysis&#13;
I st January to 31 st March 1997          1 st week of April 1998&#13;
1 st April to 30th June 1997              1 st week of July 1998&#13;
1 st July to 30th Sept. 1997              1 st week of October 1998&#13;
1 st October to 3 1 st Dec. 1997          1 st week of January 1999&#13;
36.    Reporting on Program Management. Quarterly Report No. 3 deals with various&#13;
aspects of program management at the sub-district, district and state level, and national level.&#13;
Draft Quarterly Report No. 3 for the three levels include:&#13;
* Program Management at the Tuberculosis Unit level;&#13;
* Program Management at the DTC/Chest Clinic level; and&#13;
* Program Management at the State level.&#13;
37.   The most important of the three reports is Program Management at the Tuberculosis&#13;
Unit level, since it contains the essential data on sputum conversion at two (three) months&#13;
per quarter, consumption of drugs and other items, payments made to Community Health&#13;
Volunteers and others, supervisory activities, number of sputum smear examinations, and&#13;
number of X-ray films taken in the last quarter.&#13;
38.   At the Tuberculosis Unit (Sub-District/Sub-divisional) Level.&#13;
Quarterly Report on Management contains the following 8 items:&#13;
(a)    Number of TB cases registered during the last quarter by treatment status.&#13;
(b)    Payments made to Community Health Volunteers and others for case detection&#13;
and supervision of drug administration during the last quarter.&#13;
(c)    Sputum conversion rate at two (three) months in smear-positive patients&#13;
enrolled on SCC one quarter previously (four to six months ago).&#13;
(d)    Distribution of drugs during the last quarter.&#13;
(e)    Distribution of other items during the last quarter.&#13;
(f)    Supervisory activities to the peripheral health units during the last quarter.&#13;
(g)    Examination of sputum of tuberculosis suspects by microscopy and&#13;
monitoring treatment results by microscopy examination during the last&#13;
quarter.&#13;
(h)    Examination of TB suspects by X-ray during the last quarter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62-&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
39.   At the DTC/Chest Clinic (District) Level.&#13;
The Report is based on the data provided by the Tuberculosis Units. It summarizes&#13;
information on five items:&#13;
(a)    Number of Tuberculosis Units involved in the revised RNTP.&#13;
(b)    Number of Quarterly Reports No. 3 received from Tuberculosis Units.&#13;
(c)    Supervisory activities by the state staff to the Tuberculosis Units during the last&#13;
quarter.&#13;
(d)    Consumption of anti-tuberculosis drugs during the last quarter (blister packs&#13;
and loose drugs).&#13;
(e)    Consumption of other items during the last quarter.&#13;
40.   At the State Level.&#13;
The Report contains the same information as Quarterly Report No. 3 at the district&#13;
level except that the Report is based on the data provided to the state level by DTCs.&#13;
Supervisory activities of the state level are focused on DTCs.&#13;

Annex 2&#13;
INDIA: Tuberculosis Control Project&#13;
SUMMARY OF DRUG REGIMENS&#13;
TO BE USED UNDER THE PROJECT&#13;
1.    Based on the proposed project, the project districts are classified into three groups,&#13;
each using a different drug regimen based on the TB Control strategy operating in their&#13;
respective areas. These three groupings are: (a) the 102 RNTP Districts; (b) the 203 non-&#13;
RNTP, SCC districts; and (c) the 154 non-SCC districts.&#13;
RNTP Districts&#13;
2.    Category I patients are new cases of smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis and&#13;
other newly diagnosed smear negative but seriously ill patients with severe forms of&#13;
tuberculosis. These have the highest priority in Short Course Chemotherapy (SCC) due&#13;
to infectiousness.&#13;
3.    The initial intensive phase is 2(HRZE)3, i.e., isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R),&#13;
pyrazinamide (Z) and ethambutol (E) in a blister pack, administered three (3) times a&#13;
week for two (2) months, under Directly Observed Therapy (DOT).&#13;
4.    The continuation phase is 4(HR)3, i.e., isoniazid and rifampicin in a blister pack,&#13;
administered three times a week for four months. A blister calendar pack for one week&#13;
treatment is given to the patient and at least the first dose should be directly observed at&#13;
the time of collection. On the next collection, the patient should return the empty blisters.&#13;
5.    Category II or Retreatment patients are those who have received anti-tuberculosis&#13;
treatment for more than one month in the past. They are at an increased risk of&#13;
developing multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis. These include smear positive&#13;
relapse and failure cases. These patients also have a high priority in SCC due to&#13;
infectiousness and suspicion of MDR.&#13;
6.    The initial intensive phase is 2(HRZES)3/l(HRZE)3, i.e., isoniazid, rifampicin,&#13;
pyrazinamide and ethambutol, in a blister pack, supplemented with streptomycin (S),&#13;
administered three times a week, for the first two months, followed by the same drugs,&#13;
without streptomycin, administered three times a week, through DOT, for one month.&#13;
7.    The continuation phase is 5(HRE)3, i.e., isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol, in&#13;
a blister calendar pack, administered three times a week under observation of one in three&#13;
doses and with the patients returning the empty blister pack for five months. If the&#13;
patient remains smear positive after the completion of the continuation phase, the patient&#13;
is no longer eligible for the retreatment regimen and is managed as a chronic case.&#13;
8.    Category III patients are new cases of smear negative pulmonary and extra-&#13;
pulmonary tuberculosis. These have a lower priority in SCC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
9.    The  initial intensive  phase  is 2(HRZ)3, i.e., isoniazid, rifampicin  and&#13;
pyrazinamide, in a blister pack, administered three times a week, for two months, under&#13;
DOT. If smear negative at two months, then the patient starts the continuation phase.&#13;
10.   The continuation phase is 4(HR)3, i.e., isoniazid and rifampicin in a blister pack,&#13;
administered three times a week, for four months. If the patient is smear positive at two&#13;
months, then he/she is categorized as a failure case and is put on a retreatment regimen as&#13;
described above.&#13;
Non-RNTP, SCC Districts&#13;
11.   There are two types of TB patients in the non-RNTP, SCC districts: (a) the smear&#13;
positive and the seriously ill smear negative TB patients; and (b) the non-seriously ill&#13;
smear negative TB patients.&#13;
12.   For the Smear Positive, the Seriously Ill Smear Negative TB Patients, the drug&#13;
regimen would be:&#13;
- 2(EHRZ)/6(EH). The initial intensive phase is 2(EHRZ), i.e., ethambutol,&#13;
isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide, administered daily, for two months.&#13;
* The continuation phase is 6(EH), i.e., ethambutol and isoniazid, administered&#13;
daily, for six months, and self-administered by the patient.&#13;
13.   For Non-Seriously Ill Smear Negative TB Patients, the drug regimen could take&#13;
either of two forms:&#13;
*  12(TH) or 12(EH). There is only one phase of 12 months. The drug regimen&#13;
is 12(TH)/12(EH), i.e., thiacetazone and isoniazid or ethambutol and&#13;
isoniazid, self- administered daily for 12 months.&#13;
Non-SCC Districts&#13;
14.   For Sputum Positive and Seriously Ill patients:&#13;
* The initial intensive phase is 2(STH), i.e., streptomycin, thiacetazone and&#13;
isoniazid, administered daily, for two months, or 2(SEH), i.e., streptomycin,&#13;
ethambutol and isoniazid, administered daily for two months.&#13;
* The continuation phase is I 0(TH), i.e., thiacetazone and isoniazid,&#13;
administered daily, for ten months, and self-administered by the patient, or&#13;
I 0(EH), i.e., ethambutol and isoniazid, administered daily, for ten months, and&#13;
self-administered by the patient.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
15.   For Sputum Negative and Non-seriously Ill patients:&#13;
* The drug regimen is 12(TH)/12(EH), i.e., thiacetazone and isoniazid or&#13;
ethambutol and isoniazid, self-administered daily for 12 months.&#13;

TB CONTROL PROGRAMME&#13;
1.    The chart on page 2 of this Annex depicts the revised structure that is proposed for the&#13;
National Tuberculosis Control Program and the implementation of the RNTP. These changes&#13;
respond to the rapid population growth and the increase in TB incidence since 1962 when the&#13;
current structure was introduced, and to the demands of the revised strategy.&#13;
2.    The structure of the National Program, including the RNTP has four levels, all of which&#13;
will be strengthened as part of the project:&#13;
(a)   the Central Unit at MOHFW;&#13;
(b)   the State TB Officer at the state level;&#13;
(c)   the District TB Center at the district level; and&#13;
(d)   a small TB unit at the subdistrict or equivalent internediate level.&#13;
Central Level&#13;
3.    The Central Unit will include, in addition to the Program Director, posts for a Technical&#13;
Adviser, an Accounts Specialist, a Logistics and Operational Supervisor, a Procurement&#13;
Specialist, an Operations Research Officer, a Training Officer, a Supervision and Monitoring&#13;
Officer and a Community Relations Officer.&#13;
4.    The Central Unit will be responsible for the overall implementation of the revised&#13;
strategy. This will include setting policies and procedures, ensuring, compliance with such&#13;
policies, providing technical leadership to the State and the districts, coordinating training,&#13;
activities and strengthening community relations. More specifically, the Division's main&#13;
responsibilities will be to prepare, disseminate and enforce technical and operational policies and&#13;
guidelines, ensure compliance with the program policies, provide technical assistance to the&#13;
states and districts, ensure quality control and monitor program implementation. The office of&#13;
the Joint Secretary in the administrative side of the Ministry of Health is responsible for the&#13;
financial and administrative matters related to TB and will be strengthened by adding one new&#13;
official at the level of Under Secretary, and two Assistants. The training, IEC and staff&#13;
recognition activities of the project will be a joint responsibility with the technical unit. In&#13;
addition, the Central Division will identify areas and mechanisms of coordination with the&#13;
National AIDS Program to ensure adequate inter-program support.&#13;

State Level&#13;
5.    The State Cell would be responsible for the supervision and monitoring of the program&#13;
throughout the state, including metropolitan cities, and for ensuring the integration of the&#13;
revised strategy throughout the health system. To respond to these demands, the existing State&#13;
TB cells would be strengthened with additional staff and equipment. The position of TB State&#13;
Program officer would be upgraded to give the program the prominence required. The State&#13;
TB Officer would be assisted by a Medical Officer, an IEC officer, a Secretary/Assistant and&#13;
an Accountant.&#13;
6.    More specifically, the State Tuberculosis Control Cell would be responsible for (i)&#13;
ensuring adequate supply of inputs to the service facilities, including drugs and laboratory&#13;
supplies; (ii) ensuring district compliance with eligibility criteria for participating in the&#13;
proposed project; (iii) overseeing the functioning of the District TB Centers; iv) identifying&#13;
and correcting bottlenecks in implementation; (v) overseeing implementation of staff training&#13;
plans; and (vi) ensuring quality control and appropriate recording for monitoring of project&#13;
outcomes.&#13;
District Level&#13;
7.    The establishment of the sub-district Tuberculosis Units (TUs) will alter the tasks of the&#13;
District Tuberculosis Center (DTC) and the District Tuberculosis Officer (DTO). The tasks of&#13;
the DTC in the RNTP can be summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)    coordinating and supervising tuberculosis control activities in the respective&#13;
district and working closely with the state level of the RNTP;&#13;
(b)   training or re-training all Senior Tuberculosis Supervisors and Senior&#13;
Tuberculosis Laboratory Technicians and other key peripheral workers;&#13;
(c)   serving as a referral center to the staff of the TUs and other health workers&#13;
involved in the NTP, in all aspects of tuberculosis control;&#13;
(d)   compiling and analyzing tuberculosis data for the district;&#13;
(e)    procuring supplies: drugs, laboratory reagents, sputum containers and forms,&#13;
for the district and distributing them to the TUs; and&#13;
(f)   implementing the NTP in the administrative area around the DTC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Sub-District Level&#13;
8.    A supervisory and managerial team at the peripheral level as a Tuberculosis Unit (TU)&#13;
would operate at the subdivision (block or Taluka) level in all RNTP districts. The TU would&#13;
cover a population of about 500,000 and would consist of two persons: a Senior Tuberculosis&#13;
Supervisor (STS) and a Senior Tuberculosis Laboratory Technician (STLT).&#13;
9.    The STS will keep the Tuberculosis Register and record all cases of tuberculosis&#13;
diagnosed or transferred in the administrative area covered by the TU. The diagnosis of&#13;
tuberculosis and the regimen prescribed will be the responsibility of a designated medical&#13;
officer of the health institution to which the TU is attached, for instance, a Taluka hospital.&#13;
The designated doctor will refer patients with any queries to the DTC. The main&#13;
responsibilities and tasks of the STS are found in the Technical and Operational Guidelines.&#13;
10.   The Senior Tuberculosis Laboratory Technician (STLT) is usually a senior lab&#13;
technician responsible for microscopy examination in a subdivision (district) general laboratory&#13;
(e.g. at a Taluka hospital). The responsibilities of the STLT are detailed in the Technical and&#13;
Operational Guidelines.&#13;
11.   Main Duties and Tasks of Senior Tuberculosis Supervisor (STS) at the Tuberculosis&#13;
Unit (TU).&#13;
(a)   To keep an up-to-date and accurate Tuberculosis Register and check that reports&#13;
and TB Treatment Cards are properly filled in by supervisors at CHCs and&#13;
other PHCs, or by Community Health Volunteers (CHVs).&#13;
(b)   To implement the RNTP in the subdistrict, through the staff of the primary&#13;
health facilities, under the technical guidance of the DTO and the designated&#13;
doctor at the TU.&#13;
(c)   To supervise treatment delivery to every patient in the designated TU area and&#13;
to ensure that:&#13;
(1)  the RNTP regimens are appropriately prescribed;&#13;
(2)  patients under treatment are treated under direct-observation (DOT);&#13;
(3)  drugs are given for the required period and cured patients are discharged&#13;
from treatment;&#13;
(4)  sputum is examined for tubercle bacilli at the required intervals; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
(5) patients are referred to the DTO or the designated doctor for consideration&#13;
for retreatment following the failure of chemotherapy for any reason, or if&#13;
side effects of drugs occur, or the patient needs medical attention for any&#13;
other reason.&#13;
(d)   To assist health workers in the introduction and extension of TB case-finding, in&#13;
all existing health facilities of the subdivision (subdistrict).&#13;
(e)   To regularly visit all Primary health facilities under his/her jurisdiction once&#13;
every two or three months. Also, to make detailed programmes for such visits,&#13;
at least three months in advance and send these to all PHCs.&#13;
(f)    To compile Quarterly Reports on Case-finding of New Cases and Relapses, and&#13;
Results of Treatment of smear-positive cases, under the supervision of the&#13;
designated doctor and/or DTO.&#13;
12.   The STS is appointed as per the State Government rules and should have had formal&#13;
training for the post. He is responsible to the Subdivision Medical Officer and to the DTO who&#13;
supervise him in the implementation of the DTP in the TU area.&#13;

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF&#13;
THE 1992 REVIEW OF&#13;
THE NATIONAL TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL PROGRAM (NTP) OF INDIA'&#13;
NTP's Organizational Structure.&#13;
1.    The NTP has a very weak central structure, which, for a long time, has not provided&#13;
leadership in establishing and updating policy and technical procedures and assuming program&#13;
direction. As a result, program procedures have stagnated and the original philosophy of the&#13;
NTP has not been fully implemented, nor revised to make full use of the PHC system.&#13;
2.      The functions and resources of the States, particularly in training, have not been&#13;
developed and properly utilized.&#13;
3.     In most large urban centers, the coordination of activities among different&#13;
institutions, under the guidance of the STOs and STDTCs, have not yet been implemented.&#13;
4.      Curative services (hospitals and the like) and preventive services are not coordinated&#13;
at the District level, in a single network for TB control, and the lines of authority of the DTO&#13;
are not clearly established.&#13;
5.      The extension of TB diagnosis and treatment to the community through the MPHW&#13;
has been slow and valuable human resource is not sufficiently utilized to enhance access to&#13;
care and patient compliance to the drug treatment.&#13;
6.      There is no technical and policy advisory body to provide support for the NTP in the&#13;
preparation and periodic updating of national policies, technical and administrative procedures,&#13;
and monitoring and evaluation of the NTP.2&#13;
1/ This review was carried out by a joint team comprised of representatives from the Government of India&#13;
(GOI), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) from&#13;
September 1-17, 1992. Please see India: Tuberculosis Program Review, World Health Organization, September&#13;
1992, pp.3 and 7.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Case Finding and Diagnosis&#13;
7.      A major weakness in the NTP is that usually only one or no sputum smear is obtained&#13;
before a TB diagnosis is made. The primary aim in case finding should be the identification of&#13;
sputum smear-positive cases. Before the diagnosis of TB and decision to treat are made, the&#13;
results of at least two sputum smears should be available.&#13;
8.      Another major weakness is that diagnosis is primarily based on chest x-ray results.&#13;
The role of sputum-smear examination in TB diagnosis should be greatly emphasized and the&#13;
role of radiological examination should be reconsidered. For differential diagnosis, the&#13;
ODELCA cameras and miniature films for diagnostic chest x-rays may be phased out and&#13;
replaced with equipment based on the specifications for the WHO Basic Radiological System,&#13;
after carefully working out the cost considerations. For screening of symptomatic attendees in&#13;
hospitals of large urban areas to select patients for bacteriology, small size x-rays may be&#13;
useful.&#13;
9.      The NTI laboratory manual should be revised, used for training at the state level and&#13;
distributed as a reference to the laboratory staff of the peripheral health services (PHIs).&#13;
10.     Wall posters with the basic procedures for microscopy should be made available to all&#13;
peripheral microscopy centers.&#13;
3&#13;
11.     Acceptable quality binocular microscopes should be made available.&#13;
Treatment&#13;
12.     NTP policies and procedures on treatment do not reflect the WHO recomrnended&#13;
emphasis on short-course chemotherapy and patient registration systems which facilitate the&#13;
monitoring of completion and cure rates of patients on anti-tuberculosis treatment.&#13;
13.    The NTP at the delivery level does not adequately emphasize the importance of&#13;
treatment completion as the main index for program evaluation. Service delivery focuses on&#13;
case finding activities and not on treatment completion and cure.&#13;
14.     NTP policies and procedures should ensure the use of effective and current treatment&#13;
regimens, including fewer regimens and short-course chemotherapy, where appropriate.&#13;
15.    Registration systems should solicit data to monitor completion and cure rates, with&#13;
particular focus on smear-positive TB patients.4&#13;
3/ Ibid., p.21-22.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Case Notification&#13;
16.     The current NTP reporting and recording system does not monitor the cure rate&#13;
among smear-positive cases of TB.&#13;
17.     Cohort analysis does not cover all smear-positive cases diagnosed and is not done at&#13;
the peripheral heath institutions, i.e., CHCs and PHCs that are designated as such.&#13;
18.     The NTP system of registration and notification should record essential data, such as&#13;
previous history of TB treatment, and emphasize the collection and cohort analysis of&#13;
treatment results as the main indicator of the effectiveness of the NTP.&#13;
19.     Printed copies of the laboratory and patient TB registries should be kept by the PHI&#13;
staff trained in record keeping and supervised by the District TB Center (DTC) supervisor.&#13;
20.     Quarterly standardized reports from the PHIs should be sent to the DTCs indicating&#13;
treatment results and cure rates. The DTCs, in turn, will consolidate these reports and send&#13;
them to the state TB office.5&#13;
21.     Ensuring the uninterrupted supply of anti-TB drugs to the TB patient is the&#13;
responsibility of the Center and the states.&#13;
Drug Supplies&#13;
22.     The State TB Officer (STO) should closely monitor the usage patterns, drug purchase&#13;
projections and stocks of anti-TB drugs.&#13;
23.     A buffer stock at the state level should be established, sufficient to ensure at least a&#13;
six month supply of uninterrupted drug supply to the districts.&#13;
24.     Districts and PHIs should maintain buffer stocks sufficient for three months.&#13;
25.     It is the responsibility of the Center and the states to monitor the quality of the anti-&#13;
TB drugs through a scientific institution of their choice.6&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
26.     In order to address the increase in population and health care facilities at the&#13;
periphery, additional staff (e.g., a medical officer or treatment organizer and a laboratory&#13;
supervisor) should be included in the DTC team at the sub-divisional level (500,000&#13;
population) in order to facilitate decentralization of supervision, staff training, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, and management of the DTP at the PHI level.&#13;
27.     PHI management staff should be trained to analyze their own facilities' performance&#13;
indicators and to take corrective action promptly, particularly in the areas of case findings and&#13;
treatment results.&#13;
28.     DTC, State and National staff should analyze the monthly, quarterly and annual&#13;
reports received and provide feedback to the PHIs on the priority indicators of DTP efficacy.7&#13;
Education and Training&#13;
29.     The needs for training of TB personnel for DTCs, PHIs and the like exceeds the&#13;
present training capacity of the NTI in Bangalore. The current NTP training should be&#13;
decentralized by using the existing state training facilities, medical colleges, public health&#13;
institutions and TB-oriented voluntary agencies. They should receive NTP training materials&#13;
and "train the trainer" courses to maintain standardization of training efforts.&#13;
30.     The NTP manuals should be revised to reflect the recommendations of the GOI-&#13;
WHO-SIDA review enumerated below.&#13;
31.     NTP should develop standardized educational materials for different categories of&#13;
personnel involved in TB control, including medical students, general practitioners and others&#13;
involved in private practice.&#13;
32.     NTP should develop standardized educational materials for patient motivation.8&#13;
The Private Sector&#13;
33.     About of half of new cases of TB seek care in the private sector. Although many of&#13;
these later avail of the health services in the public sector, private practitioners continue to&#13;

8/ Ibid., p.31.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
play a major role in the NTP and their management of TB cases influence the outcomes of the&#13;
NTP.&#13;
34.     Private physicians practice a variety of regimens and do not adhere to any set drug&#13;
regimen. Often their regimen is more costly than the one recommended by the NTP. Patients&#13;
are usually given a prescription and sent to a pharmacy for drug purchase, with very little&#13;
monitoring of patient compliance. Defaulter action is rarely taken.&#13;
35.     The training of private practitioners is currently not adequate and has not been&#13;
updated to incorporate recent advances in knowledge and strategies of the NTP.&#13;
36.     The capacity and organization of medical associations, like the Indian Medical&#13;
Association (IMA) and the Anti-TB Associations, have not been tapped to provide continuing&#13;
education and awareness of the NTP to the private sector.&#13;
37.     The use of health education messages targeted towards both the private physician and&#13;
the consumer regarding correct treatment regimens and the importance of completing treatment&#13;
should be tested as a method to standardize care provided by the private sector.&#13;
38.     There is need for the NTP to clarify the role of the private sector in the care of TB&#13;
patients. If a large share of TB patients do seek care in the private sector, then improved&#13;
training in medical schools and the education of private physicians should be done in order to&#13;
ensure proper diagnosis and treatment and augment cure rates for patients under private care.&#13;
Research&#13;
39.     Research can be undertaken to analyze the functioning of the NTP and to test&#13;
alternatives to improve NTP results, in particular the organization of treatment delivery&#13;
service to increase the cure rate.&#13;
40.     Operational research should be integral to the NTP to test the feasibility and results&#13;
of different technical and organizational strategies adopted by the NTP.&#13;
41.     The research potentials of the various research institutes, such as the Tuberculosis&#13;
Research Center (TRC) in Madras, the National Tuberculosis Institute (NTI) in Bangalore, the&#13;
Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in Delhi, the Institute of Thoracic Medical&#13;
Association in Madras and other such research institutes should be harnessed to bring about&#13;
paras.39 and 40 above.10 In addition to the TRC and NTI, other institutes could be tapped to&#13;

provide support to the NTP for research. Two of these institutes are the National Institute of&#13;
Communicable Diseases (NICD), in Delhi, and the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public&#13;
Health (AIIHPH) in Calcutta. 1 Both the NICD and the AIIHPH are national public health&#13;
institutes and have expertise and capabilities in epidemiological studies of TB. Both could&#13;
complement the efforts of the NTI and the TRC in operational research. 12&#13;
Recommendations'3&#13;
42.      Strengthen the organizational structure of the NTP by: (a) establishing an apex policy&#13;
making authority and an executive task force with managerial functions to implement the&#13;
reorganization of the NTP; and (b) upgrading the central TB control unit (researcher's note:&#13;
this upgrade has already been undertaken by making the TB section of the Directorate General&#13;
for Health Services (DGHS), which supervises the technical aspects of the NTP, into a&#13;
division headed by a Deputy Director (TB), when formerly it was headed by an Assistant&#13;
Director General, and by having a senior officer, with the rank of Director (TB), assist the&#13;
joint secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare who is in charge of the financial&#13;
and administrative aspects of the NTP14).&#13;
43.      Improve quality of patient diagnosis by: (a) using three smear examinations to detect&#13;
infectious cases among symptomatics before deciding on patient treatment; (b) ensuring quality&#13;
of microscopic examinations with adequate equipment, training and quality control; and (c)&#13;
establishing criteria for diagnosis by radiological and clinical methods.&#13;
44.     Direct national and state resources to ensure cure of TB patients, giving priority to&#13;
infectious TB cases, by: (a) adopting short-course chemotherapy; (b) establishing criteria for&#13;
treatment completion, cure and discharge from the TB registry; and (c) ensuring the&#13;
uninterrupted supply of quality anti-TB drugs.&#13;
45.     Revise current NTP system of registration and notification by emphasizing cohort&#13;
analysis of treatment results, viz., completion and cure, transfers, defaulters, died and&#13;
treatment failures, as the main indicators of the effectiveness of the NTP.&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
46.     Develop policies to decentralize treatment services closer to the community level to&#13;
ensure access to care and patient compliance to recommended drug regimens.&#13;
47.     Implement pilot projects at the block level to test capacity to implement paras. 43&#13;
through 46 above.&#13;
48.     Add a medical officer or treatment organizer and a laboratory supervisor at the sub-&#13;
district level (500,000 population) to strengthen NTP management and facilitate&#13;
decentralization of supervision.&#13;
49.     Develop training materials that incorporate changes proposed by the joint review in&#13;
the NTP's policies and procedures. Use not only the State TB Training and Demonstration&#13;
Centers (STTDCs), but also medical colleges, public health institutes and TB-oriented&#13;
voluntary agencies as venues for training. Make available international and national training&#13;
opportunities for different levels of NTP staff.&#13;
50.     Undertake operational research as an integral part of the NTP to: (a) evaluate NTP&#13;
performance; (b) improve service delivery; (c) increase problem solving capacity; and (d)&#13;
obtain baseline epidemiological information to measure reduction in the risk of infection.&#13;

INDIA: Tuberculosis Control Project&#13;
LESSONS LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE&#13;
Worldwide.&#13;
1.    The proposed project would benefit from lessons learned worldwide on Tuberculosis&#13;
control interventions, experiences from Bank lending for TB control and the Indian experience of&#13;
the two Pilot Phases.&#13;
2.    The Tuberculosis control strategy advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and&#13;
to be adopted by the proposed project, is based on the lessons learned from rigorous evaluations by&#13;
notable TB experts of TB control experiences worldwide. These lessons have been incorporated in&#13;
the five key elements of the WHO policy for TB control: (a) the need for government commitment&#13;
to an effective TB program; (b) a focus on case detection through predominantly passive case&#13;
finding; (c) administration of standardized short-course chemotherapy to at least all sputum-&#13;
positive cases, preferably under directly observed therapy (DOT) or similar case management&#13;
conditions; (d) establishment and maintenance of a system of regular drug supply, and (e)&#13;
establishment and maintenance of an effective monitoring system for program management and&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
3.    The background to this approach is based on the following findings from previous&#13;
experience on TB control.&#13;
4.   Domiciliary Treatment vs. Hospitalized Treatment. Prior to the establishment of&#13;
domiciliary treatment and the development of anti-TB drugs, TB patients were placed in sanitoria.&#13;
It was in the late 1950's that the Tuberculosis Research Center (TRC) in Madras, India, showed the&#13;
effectiveness of the domiciliary treatment of TB. In general, the treatment of TB is now&#13;
ambulatory; only in exceptional situations is long-term hospitalization recommended.&#13;
5.    Short-term vs. Long Term Chemotherapy. The production of powerful anti-Tuberculosis&#13;
Drugs has shortened the treatment period from 12-18 months (Long-Course or Standard&#13;
Chemotherapy) to 6-8 months (Short-Course Chemotherapy or SCC). Although Standard Therapy&#13;
(ST) drugs are cheaper than SCC drugs, the length of treatment often discourages completion and&#13;
complicates case management. The reduced mortality, morbidity and disability resulting from a&#13;
successful use of SCC make this course of treatment more cost effective than LCC drugs. It has&#13;
been shown that SCC treatment is more cost effective than oral rehydration and measles&#13;
immunization' when reduction in risk of infection is taken into account. Annex 13 provides an&#13;
1. The World Development Report: Investing in Health (Washington, D.C.: The World Bank, 1993), p. 63.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
economic analysis of TB treatment as proposed. SCC drugs are considered the best regimen for&#13;
Tuberculosis control technologically, economically and socially. Under SCC, however, rigorous&#13;
adherence to treatment, particularly during the initial phase, is critical to prevent the development of&#13;
drug resistance.&#13;
6.    Sputum Examination and Culture Tests vs. X-rays in Diagnosis and Evaluation of&#13;
Treatment Outcome. TB control means reducing to manageable levels the TB incidence and the&#13;
annual risk of TB infection in the community. Since it is the sputum-positive TB patients who are&#13;
capable of transmitting the disease, they have to be identified, treated and made non-infectious. X-&#13;
rays do not distinguish between sputum-positive and sputum-negative TB patients and has therefore&#13;
limited capacity. Furthermore, X-rays are expensive to procure and maintain. Microscopy and&#13;
culture tests are able to identify sputum-positive and sputum-negative patients and can therefore&#13;
isolate the source of infection and treat it appropriately. Furthermore, in addition to being effective&#13;
in diagnosing infectious cases of TB, sputum examinations and culture tests are also effective in&#13;
evaluating treatment effectiveness of the drug regimen. Sputum tests can determine whether a&#13;
patient has converted to sputum-negative, or non-infectious, status and is cured of TB. Culture tests&#13;
can determine if retreatment or relapse TB cases have developed drug resistant TB and to which&#13;
drugs they are resistant, so that a more effective treatment regimen can be mounted to effectively&#13;
render these patients non-infectious. X-rays, on the other hand, cannot do any of these. Therefore,&#13;
sputum examination and culture tests are the most effective ways to diagnose and evaluate TB&#13;
treatment outcomes.&#13;
7.    Directly Observed Therapy vs. Unsupervised Case Management. Directly-Observed&#13;
Therapy or DOT refers to a case management system whereby the patient swallows the prescribed&#13;
drugs in the presence of a health care worker or another person designated for that purpose. Studies&#13;
have shown that most defaults (TB patients who don't take their regular supply of drugs), occur&#13;
within the first several weeks of the start of treatment. The six-month short-course chemotherapy&#13;
regimen, although shorter in duration than the standard chemotherapy, is no assurance of treatment&#13;
completion. Moreover, with the intermittent regimen prescribed under SCC (when drugs are taken&#13;
every other day or at intervals), each day missed can make the treatment regimen less effective.&#13;
DOT has been adopted in developed and developing countries as a sure-proof method to achieve&#13;
cure with a success rate of over 80%. However, DOT is not without controversy and needs to be&#13;
addressed within the context in which the program is implemented. Fully supervised or directly-&#13;
observed treatment for intermittent drug-taking have proved feasible and successful in urban areas.&#13;
In rural areas, however, where patients live far from the nearest health center, problems of directly&#13;
supervising intermittent drug-taking have been found less effective. More creative ways of&#13;
undertaking DOT have to be developed and introduced in the rural and remote settings, e.g.,&#13;
through community leaders, traditional healers and Familial Care Givers.&#13;
8.    Vertical vs. Integrated Approach. Experience with both approaches have led to the WHO&#13;
recommendation that tuberculosis control programs should involve both the vertical and the&#13;
integrated approach, recognizing the need for a specialized TB health care workforce to provide the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
technical guidance and supervision, and the generalized health care to bring the knowledge and&#13;
technology to the periphery.&#13;
9.    The Role of the Private Sector. Recent studies of service providers in several countries,&#13;
particularly India, have shown that private physicians are actively involved in the treatment of&#13;
tuberculosis, but are often unacquainted with the most recent developments in the field; as a result,&#13;
TB treatment in the private sector is also deficient. Over 60% of the patients in India tend to visit&#13;
first a private doctor; they switch to the government service when their finances to pay for private&#13;
care run out. The systematic involvement of this sector in TB control is emerging as an important&#13;
priority for a successful TB control.&#13;
10.   Limited Effectiveness of BCG Vaccination. The vaccine, which is given to most infants,&#13;
does not prevent TB infection, but it prevents the spread of TB infection within the lungs and to&#13;
other parts of the body. The vaccine has been found effective in young children in preventing the&#13;
spread of TB in the blood stream (Miliary Tuberculosis) and in the brain and spinal cord&#13;
(Tuberculosis Meningitis). Miliary TB and TB Meningitis are the primary source of TB morbidity&#13;
and mortality in young children. The effect of the vaccine lasts 10 to 15 years.&#13;
11.   Because the BCG vaccine does not provide real protection against pulmonary TB infection,&#13;
nor does it reduce the pool of infectious, sputum-positive, TB patients, the BCG vaccine is not used&#13;
as a technological measure to control the spread of TB. The best way to protect children against&#13;
TB infection is by having the TB control program concentrate on reducing the risk of TB infection&#13;
by reducing the number of infectious, sputum-positiveTB in the families and communities where&#13;
these children live.&#13;
Experiences from Bank Lending for TB Control.&#13;
12.   Bank experience with TB control has been exclusively in projects that do not focus on TB&#13;
control alone, e.g., Lesotho's Health and Population Project (Report No. 5437-LSO, 1985); China's&#13;
Infectious and Endemic Disease Control Project (Report No. 9894-CHA, 1991); and Zimbabwe's&#13;
Sexually Transmitted Infections Prevention and Care Project (Report No. 11 730-ZIM, 1993). The&#13;
China and Bangladesh projects offered the best example for India as they have strictly followed the&#13;
WHO strategy, and, in the case of China, it represented a problem of somewhat similar magnitude&#13;
as in India. Indian TB officials visited the project to become acquainted with the details of project&#13;
implementation. The proposed project in India would be the first Bank lending operation that&#13;
would focus only on Tuberculosis Control. Such an approach is justified, given the magnitude of&#13;
the problem in India and its weak TB infrastructure.&#13;
13.   The main lessons learned from these projects relate to the use of passive case finding,&#13;
government charges for TB services, and issues of sustainability for DOT.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
14.   Passive Case Finding vs Active Case Finding. The passive case-finding approach&#13;
emphasizes successful cure rather than number of TB patients who have been actively found. The&#13;
passive case finding approach ensures rigorous program management that can later respond to&#13;
increased demand. Moreover, by emphasizing cure, more attention is given to treatment&#13;
completion which greatly reduces the risk of TB infection and the development of acquired drug-&#13;
resistant strains of TB. According to WHO, passive case finding is advisable until a cure rate of&#13;
85% is achieved. Only then can active case finding be recommended particularly to reach isolated&#13;
groups and other areas of the population.&#13;
15.   Free vs. Paid TB Care. While payment of TB care will help in efforts at cost recovery,&#13;
especially in terms of beneficiary contribution to the cost of SCC drugs, it has been found that paid&#13;
TB care has had adverse effects in China. When the Chinese authorities introduced payment for&#13;
TB care in the 1980s, after providing it free of charge in the 1960s and 1970s, the TB incidence and&#13;
the risk of infection rose dramatically, forcing the Chinese authorities to revert back in the 1 990s to&#13;
their original practice of providing free TB care.2&#13;
16.   Sustainability of Directly-Observed Therapvy. One of the concerns with the use of DOT is&#13;
the potential cost it represents to the government if extra payments need to be made for this service.&#13;
Because DOT is laborintensive and requires considerable manpower for an extended period of&#13;
time, it is important that provisions be made ahead of time to reduce the burden this approach may&#13;
create to the government budgetary system.&#13;
Findings from the Pilot Projects - Phases I and II.&#13;
17.   The findings of the Phase I and Phase II pilots constitute valuable experiences for the&#13;
proposed project. The pilots provided critical information in defining the roles of the management&#13;
units at each level, the amendments needed in the technical and operational guidelines, the technical&#13;
specifications of certain medical inputs, and the procurement and distribution systems. They also&#13;
pointed to the need for: (a) a strong Central Management Unit that would provide clear and decisive&#13;
leadership and management direction; (b) a broader project scope in order to elicit the political will&#13;
needed for successful TB control; (c) an effective and rigorous training program that would&#13;
facilitate the transfer of knowledge needed to implement the new technical approach; (d) creative&#13;
institutional arrangements to help promote the adoption of the revised strategy not only within the&#13;
existing TB structure but most importantly throughout the health system; and (e) the involvement&#13;
of the private and NGO sector given the important role private physicians play in TB treatment in&#13;
India. (Annex 11 describes the implementation and outcomes of the project.)&#13;

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE INDIAN CENTRAL COUNCIL OF HEALTH - 1995&#13;
On September 1995, the Council reviewed the National Tuberculosis Control Programme&#13;
(NTCP) and was concerned about the increasing threat of TB-HIV co-infection, emergence of&#13;
multi-drug resistant strains of Tuberculosis and low cure rates under the NTCP. The Council&#13;
expressed an urgent need to strengthen the program in order to prevent further deterioration in&#13;
the Tuberculosis situation. The following resolutions were passed by the Council:&#13;
1.    Notifiable Disease: The Council felt that Tuberculosis should be made a notifiable&#13;
disease so that all TB cases detected by different institutions (Government and Private)&#13;
are reported to the NTCP.&#13;
2.    Increase Budget Allocation: The Council recommended the Central and State&#13;
Governments to increase the budget allocation for Tuberculosis, at least to the extent of&#13;
providing Standardized Short-Course Chemotherapeutic drugs to all patients put on&#13;
treatment under the NTCP.&#13;
J.    Early Detection and Cure: The Council desired that efforts must be made to cure at least&#13;
85 percent of all sputum-positive cases and to detect at least 70 percent of the estimated&#13;
incidence through the primary health care approach, involving the peripheral health&#13;
functionaries.&#13;
4.    Infrastructure: The Council recommended the States/UTs to fill up all vacant posts in the&#13;
State TB Training Centres, District TB Centres and the staff in the Peripheral Health&#13;
Institutions doing Tuberculosis work on a priority basis and appropriately train them at&#13;
the State and National Training Institutes.&#13;
5.    Logistics: The Council recommended the Centre and State Governments to ensure&#13;
timely, adequate and uninterrupted supply of anti-TB drugs to the most peripheral areas&#13;
by simplifying and gearing up the administrative procedures involved in their&#13;
procurement and supply.&#13;
6.    NGOs and Private Sector: Efforts should be made to involve the NGOs and Private&#13;
Sector in the NTCP. The Council desired that necessary steps must be taken in this&#13;
direction by the Centre/States.&#13;
7.    Short-Course Chemotherapy should be introduced in each district expeditiously to cover&#13;
at least all sputum positive patients.&#13;
8.    IEC activities should be further intensified.&#13;

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR THE SELECTION, IMPLEMENTATION AND&#13;
EXPANSION OF RNTP DISTRICTS&#13;
1.    There are currently a total of 496 districts in India. District TB Centers are&#13;
operating in 446 districts. In some of the remaining 50 districts, tuberculosis control&#13;
activities are being undertaken by TB clinics (total 330) and TB hospitals (total beds:&#13;
47,600). Out of 446 districts, 292 are currently undertaking Short-Course Chemotherapy&#13;
(SCC), while the remaining 154 districts are still using Long-Course Chemotherapy&#13;
(LCC). Out of 292 SCC districts, four districts in Orissa are likely to be covered by&#13;
DANIDA, and one district in Andhra Pradesh is functioning under ODA. Out of the&#13;
remaining 287 districts, 84 are designated project or RNTP districts and also include the&#13;
districts covered by the two sets of pilots during project preparation. The remaining 18&#13;
districts included in the 102 proposed RNTP districts are out of 154 non-SCC districts.&#13;
While the project seeks to fully implement the RNTP in these 102 SCC districts, the&#13;
project will also include partial financing of TB activities in the remaining 203 SCC&#13;
districts in preparation for adoption of the RNTP. In addition, the project would fund the&#13;
drug requirement for all sputum positive patients throughout the country. The project&#13;
would not fund TB control expenditures in districts covered by other donors.&#13;
2.    In order to be eligible to participate in the RNTP, a district would need to meet the&#13;
following criteria:&#13;
a. Selection of Initial Districts.&#13;

Annex 8&#13;
INDIA: Tuberculosis Control Project&#13;
DISTRICT TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL SOCIETIES (DTCS)&#13;
1.    District Tuberculosis Control Societies (DTCS) will be established in all of the&#13;
project districts. In the districts where there are already District Leprosy Societies or another&#13;
equivalent Health Society, their charters would be revised to transform them into District&#13;
Leprosy/Health Cum Tuberculosis Societies.&#13;
2.    Rationale. DTCS are important structures in the Revised National Tuberculosis&#13;
Control Program (RNTP). Since the GOI's 8th Year Plan, districts have become the&#13;
implementing foci of various development programs. With an average population of 15 to&#13;
20 lakhs (i.e., 1.5 to 2.0 million people), districts have also become the most viable fora for&#13;
coordinating the activities of the government, private and voluntary sectors. DTCS are&#13;
likewise important vehicles for ensuring the uninterrupted flow of funds to project districts.&#13;
Finally, while it is possible to frame policies, guidelines, norms and broad strategies for&#13;
action at the national and state levels, it is only the district officials and citizens who best&#13;
know their district and are the most appropriate people to decide how to effectively&#13;
implement the RNTP based on local conditions in the district in terms of diverse socio-&#13;
economic status, population size, geographical terrain, etc.&#13;
3.    Membership. The DTCS would consist of a maximum of 20 members equally&#13;
divided between the government (10) and the non-government/private sectors (10). The&#13;
chairman would be the District Officer (e.g., Collector, Magistrate, Deputy Commissioner)&#13;
and the member secretary would be the District TB Control Officer (DTO).&#13;
4.    Funding and Activities. While the DTCS would receive funding from project funds&#13;
through submission of reimbursement claims in terms of audited Statements of Expenses&#13;
(SOEs) to the Government of India (GOI), the Government of India may consider allowing&#13;
District TB Societies to raise their own funds for TB Control. These funds, whether from&#13;
project or private sources, would be used to finance various activities including (a) the&#13;
payment of district contractual staff and honoraria of those who conduct Directly-Observed&#13;
Therapy (DOT); (b) Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities; (c) active&#13;
involvement of the private and Non-Government Organization (NGO) sectors in the RNTP;&#13;
(d) the running and maintenance of project vehicles; and (e) minor civil works such as&#13;
additions or alterations required in establishing microscopy centers. In terms of providing&#13;
honoraria to non-government DOT workers, such honoraria would be paid AFTER proof or&#13;
certificate has been acquired from the DTO that such a person was undertaking DOT to such&#13;
TB patient(s) whose names and addresses are specified during the intensive phase and&#13;
continuation phase of the drug regimen and that, as a result of such DOT, the patient(s) was&#13;
able to complete treatment and cured of TB.&#13;
5.    Functions of the DTCS. These would include: (a) situational analysis and planning&#13;
(e.g., periodic assessment of the magnitude of the TB problem in the district, district needs,&#13;
status of available district facilities and resources such as infrastructure and manpower; and&#13;
preparation of an annual district action plan); (b) resource mobilization (e.g., receive and&#13;
monitor the use of funds, equipment and materials); (c) coordination among government,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
inter-government, private and NGO sectors; and (d) implementation (e.g., strengthen existing&#13;
and potential facilities and resources; undertake IEC; collect, compile and report information&#13;
concerning the RNTP in the district on a quarterly basis; upgrade the knowledge and skills of&#13;
service providers tl;rough IEC activities, training programs and sponsorship in conferences&#13;
and workshops).&#13;
6.    Term of Office. The term of office of both ex-officio and nominated members of the&#13;
DTCS is two years. Re-nomination is on a yearly basis.&#13;
7.    Powers and Functions of the Executive Body/Governing Council. The Executive&#13;
Body/Governing Council would be comprised of the Chair, the Vice-Chair and member&#13;
secretary of the DTCS and those members attending the Council Meetings. Its powers and&#13;
functions would be to: (a) approve an annual budget; (b) consider and approve the annual&#13;
account with the audit report; (c) inspect and supervise the implementation of RNTP&#13;
schemes under the guidance and advice of State and Central governments; (d) undertake&#13;
activities consistent with the aims of the Society; and (e) take decision on any matters&#13;
referred to it by the Central or State government, or the chairman.&#13;
8.    Powers of Member Secretary. These would include: (a) all executive and financial&#13;
powers consistent with the Member Secretary's responsibility for the planning,&#13;
implementation and monitoring of time bound activities; (b) supervision of the Society's&#13;
activities; (c) provision and distribution of needed drugs, medical consumables, equipment,&#13;
other supplies and health education materials; (d) submission of periodic reports to central&#13;
and state authorities; and (e) exercise and discharge such duties delegated by the Executive&#13;
Body/Governing Council.&#13;
9.    Meeting of the Governing Council. The Council is to meet at least once in six&#13;
months, or as often as necessary to transact Society business, and the date and time of such&#13;
meetings shall be set by the member secretary in consultation with the Chair. Two weeks,&#13;
or, in case of emergency, 48 hours notice of the meeting shall be given to the members either&#13;
personally or by post by the member secretary. A quorum would consist of at least five&#13;
members and decisions shall be taken by a majority vote of the members present in the&#13;
meeting.&#13;
10.   Emergency Powers. These are vested on the Chair and member secretary, who,&#13;
acting together, shall exercise all powers of the Governing Council in case of emergencies&#13;
and whose emergency actions shall be reported in the next meeting of the Governing Council&#13;
and its approval sought.&#13;
11.   Registration and Office. The DTCS shall be formed and registered under the&#13;
Societies Registration Act of 1860 and any other similar act by the state government. The&#13;
registered office of the DTCS is the District Headquarters.&#13;

State Trainer Trainees&#13;
2.    The trainee selected to be trained as a trainer would ideally be a person already&#13;
working in the TB Control program with experience in training activity. The candidates&#13;
would therefore be chosen from persons working in STDCs, State TB units, TB hospitals,&#13;
medical colleges in the vicinity of the STDCs, project officers in the RNTP, District TB&#13;
Officers and the neighboring Family Welfare Training Institutes. Trainers must be given&#13;
practical field experience in RNTP training and demonstration areas. Responsibility for&#13;
training and monitoring the results of training will be assigned to Central and State&#13;

Training Curricula&#13;
13.   Center. The task of developing, field testing and revising training materials and&#13;
curricula for all levels of health staff to be trained in the Project will be undertaken by&#13;
DGHS in collaboration with Central Institutes and other technical institutions.&#13;
Coordination of this effort would be improved to speedily produce materials of the&#13;
quality desired.&#13;
14.   To make the curricula consistent with the program, agreement would be reached&#13;
on a uniform format, use of illustrations and attractive easy-to-read typeface. A range of&#13;
training methods would be included to ensure that participants think, act and practice&#13;
skills during training.&#13;
15.   NGOs and the Private Sector. While the current involvement of experienced staff&#13;
from the four central training institutions is appropriate, NGO staff would also be asked&#13;
to contribute to developing modules for MPWs and CHVs. Private medical associations&#13;
such as the IMA would be involved to offer ways to communicate crucial information to&#13;
their members regarding drug use and the RNTP operations.&#13;
16.   Information. Education and Communication (IEC). The IEC component would be&#13;
integrated into the training program for each cadre of worker.&#13;
17.   DO and MO. The core curricula for the training of doctors would be the series of&#13;
WHO modules Managing Tuberculosis at the District Level comprising of:&#13;
Al Introduction&#13;
A2 Administering Treatment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 9&#13;
A3 Registering Cases&#13;
A4 Ensuring Identification of Tuberculosis Suspects&#13;
A5 Monitoring Treatment&#13;
A6 Quarterly Reporting on Case Finding&#13;
A7 Quarterly Reporting on Treatment Results&#13;
A8 Maintaining Regular Drug Supplies and Other Materials&#13;
18.   There would be need to correct discrepancies with the RNTP guidelines such as:&#13;
(a) daily regimens (WHO) vs thrice weekly regimens (RNTP); and (b) advice about side&#13;
effects whereby it is suggested that patients immediately stop treatment and see the&#13;
closest health staff if there is a red/orange discoloration of the urine when this is a&#13;
common and harmless side effect of taking rifampicin.&#13;
19.   While it is reported that trainers and participants often agree to skip the role play&#13;
exercises in Module A2 (pp. 95-99) on Communicating With Patients, this would be&#13;
avoided as lack of training in this area threatens to weaken compliance with therapy if&#13;
patients have a poor basic understanding of TB and do not comprehend the importance of&#13;
their medications, frequency, side effects, sputum exams, and/or dangers of developing&#13;
resistance.&#13;
20.   Skills in conducting supervisory visits, using the TB register workbook and&#13;
interacting with the supporting laboratory services would be included in the curriculum.&#13;
21.   STLS. The content of the curricula would include at least all of the Laboratory&#13;
Technician Training, WHO Module A5. orientation to the quality control system and&#13;
supervision skills.&#13;
22.   LT. The Manual for Laboratory Technicians Training (Mycobacteriologv) by the&#13;
L.R.S. Institute in Delhi would need to be reviewed and revised to include content and&#13;
exercises on microscope repair, record keeping in the laboratory and maintaining stocks&#13;
of reagents, slides, etc.&#13;
23.   STS/TO/SA. The draft Module for Senior Tuberculosis Supervisor/TB Health&#13;
Visitor by the L.R.S. Institute in Delhi would be supplemented with the IEC component,&#13;
as well as training objectives and instructions for organizing the field work on&#13;
supervising Directly-Observed Therapy (DOT).&#13;
24.   MPW. There is a draft Module for Training of Health Workers on Tuberculosis&#13;
(Revised Strategy) by the Gandhigram Institute of Rural Health and Family Welfare&#13;
Trust. The draft would be revised to incorporate the IEC component and be consistent&#13;
with the RNTP technical and operational guidelines.&#13;
25.   MPHS/TBHV. CHV/Anganwadi HW and Storekeeper/Pharmacist. Curricula and&#13;
training materials would need to be developed for these levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
26.   Trainers Experience in the RNTP. All the trainers would need at least a few days&#13;
observing the RNTP at the district level. They would need to have hands-on experience&#13;
managing, supervising and providing services under the revised technical and operational&#13;
guidelines.&#13;

INDIA: Tuberculosis Control Project&#13;
OPERATIONS RESEARCH&#13;
1.    Goal. The goal of Operations Research is two-fold: (a) to build local capacity for&#13;
Operations Research in India, including establishing an operations research network&#13;
among various public, private and NGO institutions, both local and international; and (b)&#13;
to generate appropriate and continuous flow of information to make Tuberculosis control&#13;
in India more efficient and effective.&#13;
2.    Central Steering Committee. A steering committee would be established at the&#13;
national level with the Director General of Health Services as Chairman. The Member-&#13;
Secretary would be the Central TB Division officer responsible for operations research.&#13;
The members would be one representative each from major research institutions such as&#13;
the NTI, TRC, LRS Institute, IMA, and national level NGOs and representatives from&#13;
concerned international organizations such as WHO, ODA and DANIDA.&#13;
3.    Protocol Development Workshops. Research Institutions within India, including&#13;
NTI, TRC, LRS and NICD, that are interested in undertaking programs of work in&#13;
specified areas of tuberculosis operations research would be identified through Protocol&#13;
Development Workshops. These workshops would be organized to finalize area-wise&#13;
priorities of operations research and develop skeletal outlines of protocols. Attendees in&#13;
these workshops would include: (a) noted researchers from research institutions; (b)&#13;
international experts; and (c) program managers of pilot areas where the revised NTP&#13;
(RNTP) is being implemented.&#13;
4.    Approval Process. During the Protocol Development Workshops, investigators&#13;
would be asked to submit protocols on allotted priorities and agreed program work for&#13;
operations research in particular geographical areas. The protocols that have been&#13;
submitted would be screened by the Central TB Division and would then be reviewed by&#13;
the Steering Committee for selection and approval of specific studies for implementation.&#13;
The Central TB Division would then provide funds for such studies. These operations&#13;
research studies would be monitored and periodically reviewed by the Central TB&#13;
Division and the Steering Committee. The Central TB Division would develop&#13;
mechanisms to transfer the results of the different operations research studies into the&#13;
Tuberculosis Control Program in order to make the services more efficient and effective.&#13;
5.    District Program Managers. The District Program Managers (DPMs) would be&#13;
expected to: (a) interact with researchers and inform them of the problems faced in&#13;
implementation of the RNTP; (b) attend the Protocol Development Workshops, symposia&#13;
and meetings in order to assist in the selection of operations research priorities and&#13;
protocol formulation; and (c) assist, in terms of logistical support, the research&#13;
institutions conducting operations research studies in their respective areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100-&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
6.    Sample Operations Research Priorities. Major responsibilities of the central&#13;
division and the steering committee would be to coordinate the different sources of&#13;
support to operational research to ensure that the studies are processed, executed and&#13;
reported rapidly and that the results are applied to guide policy decisions and programme&#13;
implementation. The following major areas for study would be refined and prioritized by&#13;
the steering committee and recommendations on the four areas of research to be carried&#13;
out under the project would be submitted to IDA by January 1, 1998.&#13;
(a)   Effectiveness of Individual elements of the RNTP strategy. The RNTP&#13;
package incorporates several elements of TB control. The recording and&#13;
reporting system and a regular drug supply would be introduced into all&#13;
SCC districts at the start of the program, the rest of the RNTP package will&#13;
be introduced into districts in a phased manner over subsequent years. It&#13;
would be feasible and ethical to investigate the impact of different&#13;
individual components on TB control: outcome measures in full RNTP&#13;
districts can be compared with others without decentralisation of care,&#13;
without direct observation of therapy, without improved diagnosis and&#13;
without short course chemotherapy, etc.&#13;
(b)   Operational studies on TB service delivery. Detection and management of&#13;
TB cases depends on the coverage of general health services and their&#13;
capacity to provide high quality, affordable care to the community. Studies&#13;
on the real proportion of outpatients with respiratory symptoms (productive&#13;
cough), the proportion of smear- positive cases among them according to&#13;
the duration of cough, access for women and special groups to health&#13;
services and to specific TB diagnosis and treatment, and hospital/health&#13;
centre organization are required, to monitor TB management by health&#13;
facilities.&#13;
(c)   Public/p2rivate mix of TB treatment sources. Currently a substantial&#13;
proportion of TB patients do not first seek professional health care from&#13;
government-run services. Much of the TB treatment given by private&#13;
providers (including for-profit providers) has been achieving palliation&#13;
instead of docum: .ted cure. Therefore it is necessary to: (a) develop and&#13;
test methods to achieve a better public/private mix of TB treatment sources&#13;
in various ways, including methods to improve the image and share of&#13;
government-run services; (b) develop options for involvement of the&#13;
various health care providers in delivering documented TB cure; and,&#13;
establish contractual arrangements, incentives and disincentives to engage&#13;
private providers in delivery of documented TB cures.&#13;
(d)  Perceived importance of TB. and of documented cure. High-quality&#13;
technical strategies can succeed to the extent that a wide range of potential&#13;
stakeholders consider them important and useful. Support for the RNTP&#13;
depends partly on socio-behavioral studies, including analysis of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
stakeholders and their interests; design and pilot testing of communications&#13;
strategies; and assessment of the perceptions about TB and about the RNTP&#13;
held by various sectors (including the health professionals, NGOs and&#13;
general public) at periodic intervals during implementation.&#13;
(e)   Economic and social impact of TB and benefits of the RNTP. There is&#13;
growing recognition of the burden imposed by TB and the benefits of TB&#13;
cure to individuals, households, and the society. However, documentation&#13;
of these impacts in India has been rare. Such documentation is useful to&#13;
help sustain the momentum of the RNTP and to justify investments for&#13;
sustainability. In particular, it would be useful to document the burden&#13;
imposed by TB on marginalized groups, and the benefits of TB cure to&#13;
them at the level of individuals, households and the society.&#13;
(f)   Cost-effectiveness of the RNTP and alternative approaches to TB&#13;
treatment. Although the consistency of TB cure in a well-functioning&#13;
RNTP makes it hard to match in terms of cost-effectiveness, there is a&#13;
scarcity of data documenting costs and analysing cost-effectiveness ratios.&#13;
This needs to be remedied by a series of careful cost-effectiveness analyses,&#13;
and computation of important parameters including the average and&#13;
marginal cost per cure.&#13;
(g)  User-friendliness of the RNTP for special populations. Studies of the costs&#13;
and inconveniences borne by the TB patient in the course of treatment&#13;
should help to fine-tune the programme to achieve greater success. This is&#13;
likely to be particularly important in the case of marginalized and&#13;
disempowered groups, as the more accessible groups are covered. This&#13;
includes studies on accessibility and adequacy of TB management&#13;
strategies to mobile populations, tribal groups, refugees, etc.&#13;
(h)  Improving household and community participation in assisting TB cure&#13;
(including educational materials development). Pilot trials of innovative&#13;
arrangements for involving the community in helping to achieve&#13;
documented TB cure are needed, especially the development and testing of&#13;
educational materials for lay people; as well as development and testing of&#13;
locally appropriate communication strategies.&#13;
(i)   Monitoring drug resistance. The true magnitude of the antituberculosis&#13;
drug resistance problem in India is not well described, and the trend will be&#13;
an important indicator of programme effectiveness. In early 1994 the&#13;
WHO/GTB and the IUATLD started a global project to utilize drug&#13;
resistance as an indicator to measure the performance of TB programs and,&#13;
in certain settings, improve the NTP performance by contributing to policy&#13;
recommendations on treatment. The strategy to achieve this aim consists of&#13;
the implementation of standardized drug resistance surveillance in new and&#13;
re-treatment cases (in order to distinguish between primary and acquired&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
drug resistance), representative of the population studied, under the&#13;
guidance of a network of supranational reference laboratories (SRL). Drug&#13;
resistance studies should be carried out during project implementation, both&#13;
in RNTP fully implemented districts and in districts to be implemented,&#13;
following the standard procedures of the network.&#13;
U)   TB/HIV surveillance: Measuring the HIV seroprevalence among&#13;
tuberculosis patients is important to the tuberculosis programme, as it&#13;
allows to plan resource allocation and strengthening of the local program&#13;
where the HIV prevalence is high. Areas with high HIV prevalence are&#13;
those where inevitably the tuberculosis burden is going to increase rapidly,&#13;
due to the immunosuppression induced by HIV infection, reactivation of&#13;
latent tuberculosis infection and rapid progression of a new infection to&#13;
disease. WHO has produced guidelines on anonymous unlinked HIV&#13;
surveillance among tuberculosis patients. They could be adopted in India to&#13;
have a precise understanding of the extent, distribution and trends of the&#13;
problem.&#13;
(k)  Fixed-Dose Combination Therapy: Fixed dose combination therapy has&#13;
significant advantages in promoting adherence to TB treatment, and in&#13;
decreasing drug resistance. Their widespread introduction into the RNTP&#13;
would be considered during the mid-term review. There is at present&#13;
remarkably little hard research data to base such decision in India. Fixed&#13;
drug combinations can be introduced on a pilot basis in selected districts,&#13;
following well designed research protocols, to measure the advantages in&#13;
operational management and acceptability of treatment.&#13;
(1)   Drug Ouality: There is concern about the quality and bioavailability of TB&#13;
drugs available in India, and the inadequacies of the current monitoring&#13;
systems. There is a need to describe the scale and scope of the problem,&#13;
and to develop a system to sample the drugs available, test their quality,&#13;
and disseminate the results. While quality is an important issue when using&#13;
single drugs, there is an increasing trend towards the use of combination&#13;
pills, which are far more prone to variations in quality. There is a need to&#13;
develop effective systems whereby the bioequivalence of large purchases of&#13;
fixed dose combination drugs can be measured, and the bioavailability of&#13;
the drugs that are used in the market place can be monitored.&#13;
(m)  Baseline for measuring the trend of the TB epidemic: The risk of infection&#13;
is the best indicator of the long-term trend of tuberculosis transmission, and&#13;
therefore the indicator for the major public health objective of the&#13;
programme. Although it cannot measure the impact in the short five year&#13;
period of this project, baseline data is required to measure the impact of the&#13;
programme and future of the epidemic, particularly as the expansion of&#13;
HIV will eliminate the usefulness of incidence and mortality for this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 10&#13;
purpose. Representative studies of prevalence of infection in children&#13;
should be carried out for this purpose.&#13;
(n)   Other areas of study may include:&#13;
(1)   the value of in-built quality control for sputum smear microscopy,&#13;
incorporating facilities for proper maintenance and repair of&#13;
microscopes;&#13;
(2)   the factors attributable to patients and health services which are&#13;
responsible for delaying case-detection;&#13;
(3)   the development of methods which will enhance treatment&#13;
adherence Short Course Chemotherapy (SCC) and behavioral&#13;
studies for understanding the reasons for post-treatment&#13;
compliance;&#13;
(4)   Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (K.A.P.) studies among medical&#13;
professionals, para-medical workers, tribal population and urban&#13;
slum dwellers to improve program delivery;&#13;
(5)   alternative simplified procedures for procurement and supply of&#13;
drugs; and&#13;
(6)   strategies for involving major hospitals and academic institutions&#13;
in the RNTP.&#13;

INDIA: Tuberculosis Control Project&#13;
PHASES I AND II PILOT PROJECTS&#13;
Initial transition from the NTP to the RNTP&#13;
1.   In preparation for a shift of strategy to control TB in a more effective way, the GOI&#13;
carried out two sets of pilot projects. The main purpose of the Phases I and II pilot projects was&#13;
to test a new paradigm for TB control in the Indian context based on the 1992 recommendations&#13;
of the joint GOI-WHO-SIDA review of the NTP. In summary, the review found the following&#13;
inter-connected problems in India's 30-year-old National Tuberculosis Control Program (NTP):&#13;
(a) a weak central unit; (b) poor quality of diagnosis, based mainly on X-rays; (c) multiple&#13;
treatment regimens; (d) lack of sufficient funds for regular supplies of drugs, particularly the&#13;
SCC drugs recommended for smear-positive patients; (e) treatment completion rate of 25% on&#13;
average; (f) low proportion of infectious cases among the estimated 1.5 million cases reported&#13;
per year; (g) lack of monitoring of program performance and quality; (h) irregularity in the&#13;
supply of drugs; and (i) frequent transfer of patients between the public and private sectors,&#13;
contributing to default and drug resistance (see Annex 4 for details on the Program Review).&#13;
Phase I Pilots&#13;
2.    With the findings and recommendations of the joint review, a task force was created to&#13;
develop the pilots. In February 1993, the technical guidelines and a plan of activities to&#13;
implement the pilots were prepared and approved. Financial assistance came from SIDA. The&#13;
pilots were implemented in two taluks in the Mehsana district of Gujarat (population 400,000),&#13;
one ward in Bombay (population 350,000) and one Chest Clinic area in Gulabi Bagh in Delhi&#13;
(population one million) in October 1993 and in Calcutta and Bangalore in early 1994.&#13;
3.    The basic principles of the project included: (a) use of intermittent, Directly-Observed&#13;
SCC (DOTS) during the initial phase for smear-positive cases and a strengthened regimen for re-&#13;
treatment cases; (b) use of multi-purpose health workers to administer DOTS and provide drugs;&#13;
(c) registration, monitoring and evaluation of program results based on WHO guidelines; (d)&#13;
establishment in rural areas of a TB unit for program supervision at the sub-district level&#13;
(population about 500,000); and (e) strengthened laboratory services to form the basis for&#13;
diagnosis.&#13;
4.    Training for the pilot areas started at the national level in July 1993. Training was&#13;
undertaken at the National Tuberculosis Institute (NTI) in Bangalore using the WHO modules&#13;
and at the WHO regional office (SEARO) in New Delhi.&#13;
5.    By October 1993, the pilot sites (Delhi, Bombay and Gujarat) had started registering&#13;
cases, the central team had been reinforced and GOI had committed increased financial resources&#13;
for the Tuberculosis Program. Calcutta and Bangalore started the pilots in early 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
6.    Although the basic principles of the pilot were maintained in all the pilot sites,&#13;
adjustments were made to respond to local circumstances. Delhi established specialized TB units&#13;
in ten existing general dispensaries, each staffed with a treatment supervisor and a microscopist.&#13;
Bombay maintained DOTS for the whole duration of treatment and developed a computerized&#13;
system for registration instead of hand-written books and cards. Gujarat implemented treatment&#13;
supervision mainly through existing multi-purpose health workers at the village level (population&#13;
3,000).&#13;
7.    The Phase I pilots showed that the RNTP was feasible and could produce satisfactory&#13;
results. In the evaluation carried out in April 1994. 83% of the cohort of smear positive cases&#13;
registered in the first quarter of the pilots were smear negative at three months. Furthermore, the&#13;
quality of diagnosis improved, with the proportion of smear negative pulmonary cases&#13;
diminishing rapidly to around 50%.&#13;
8.    In an evaluation of the pilot sites from data from October 1993 through December 1994,&#13;
3,777 cases were registered, two-thirds of which were males. 1,343 were new smear positive&#13;
cases (Category I) and 468 smear positive relapses (Category II). The results of sputum&#13;
conversion at three months among new smear positive cases varied from 64.4% in Calcutta to&#13;
96.8% in Delhi, for an average of 86.1%. 79.3% of these cases were cured or completed&#13;
treatment. Through September 1996, the pilot projects have treated a total of 15,821 patients in a&#13;
population base coverage of roughly 12 million with cure rates as high as 92% and 80%, on&#13;
average, for all the sites.&#13;
Lessons Learned from Phase I&#13;
9.    Below are clusters of valuable lessons learned from the Phase I pilot projects:&#13;
(a) Central planning needed to be done much earlier to ensure that essential resources&#13;
were available when required. Guidelines and forms needed to be reproduced at the&#13;
central level for uniformity. Frequent supervision by trained staff with experience in&#13;
the pilot project strategy was necessary. The officers responsible for new areas need&#13;
to be trained in visits to already implemented projects.&#13;
(b) Active case finding should not have been done. Manual records (registry books) were&#13;
necessary, even when the system was computerized, to ensure quality of data.&#13;
Detailed mapping of existing health facilities and population centers ought to have&#13;
been available before starting implementation.&#13;
(c) Multi-purpose health workers could provide effectively supervised treatment and this&#13;
extra work did not interfere with other activities. In fact, it stimulated other programs&#13;
and increased their status.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 11&#13;
Areas for Improvement in Phase I&#13;
10.   While the results of Phase I in terms of sputum conversion and cure were very good and&#13;
they demonstrated the feasibility of patient registration and DOT and justified extension of the&#13;
RNTP to larger populations, there were areas that needed improvement such as:&#13;
(a) Phase I did not provide sufficient information on the expected case load (incidence)&#13;
nor on the feasibility and effectiveness of a sub-district TB supervision unit for rural&#13;
areas, nor on methods to involve NGOs and private practitioners.&#13;
(b) Frequent changes of the national program manager produced delays in project&#13;
implementation and in the consolidation of the national program management team.&#13;
(c) Implementation was undertaken under significant constraints of resources and&#13;
equipment and without all the required inputs from the central government such as&#13;
printed guidelines. record books, regular supervision, funding and drugs.&#13;
Phase II Pilots&#13;
11.   In order to build on the lessons learned and areas for improvement in Phase 1, and as an&#13;
immediate preparation for a proposed Tuberculosis Control Project to be financed with IDA&#13;
assistance, a second series (Phase II) of demonstration pilots was prepared through an IDA&#13;
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) credit advance. The British Overseas Development&#13;
Administration (ODA) provided co-financing.&#13;
12.   As part of preparation for Phase II, the technical and operational guidelines were revised&#13;
on the basis of the experience acquired in Phase I. The Phase II pilots comprised TB Centers in&#13;
five states and ten cities (total population 12 million) and were launched in February 1994.&#13;
Phase II was implemented only in those sites which had received the necessary resources to&#13;
undertake the RNTP and had completed site preparations. One of the criteria whereby a site&#13;
could demonstrate that it completed site preparations was the participatory drafting of a specific&#13;
RNTP plan of action, including objectives, activities and inputs. Eventually, all 15 sites entered&#13;
the program.&#13;
13.   The Phase II pilots demonstrated the feasibility of expanding the RNTP to a much larger&#13;
population and at the same time getting the same results as in the Phase I pilots. From data&#13;
through December 1995, out of 2,858 new smear positive cases, 85. 1% had converted by the&#13;
third month of treatment. Of the initial 1,546 new smear positive cases put on treatment, 80.0%&#13;
had completed treatment successfully. The Central Division was likewise strengthened further&#13;
with additional new staff actively involved in both the implementation of the pilots and the&#13;
preparation of the proposed Tuberculosis Control project. Phase II implemented the&#13;
recommendations emerging from Phase I and validated the areas requiring improvement. which&#13;
are expected to be corrected with the proposed project.&#13;

INDIA: Tuberculosis Control Project&#13;
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES&#13;
1. Cost Effectiveness and Monetary Benefits of Tuberculosis Treatment&#13;
Cost Effectiveness&#13;
I .    The 1993 World Development Report argued that the costs per death averted and per&#13;
year of life saved make chemotherapy for smear-positive tuberculosis (TB) patients the&#13;
cheapest known health intervention available in developing countries. Cost per year of life&#13;
saved was estimated at between US$I and US$4. Other highly cost-effective health&#13;
interventions including immunization for measles and tetanus, ORT for diarrhea and BCG&#13;
vaccinations, cost between $5 and 10 dollars per year of life saved. The results for TB&#13;
assume that the treatment is efficiently administered. Since in practice it often is not, the&#13;
actual cost:benefit ratio may be larger. In addition, different treatments are available.&#13;
Consequently, cost effectiveness analysis needs to emphasize alternative forms of treatment&#13;
and focus not only on their potential cure rates but also on the likely cure rates.&#13;
2.     The large benefits resulting from the cure of smear positive cases of TB (in&#13;
particular) mainly result from the infectious nature of the disease and the consequent reduced&#13;
level of transmission. Each untreated case causes roughly one additional case. Over an 18&#13;
year period, it is estimated that each untreated case leads to 5.2 deaths. Of all deaths&#13;
ultimately attributable to a set of smear positive cases, 1 8 percent are due to direct mortality&#13;
and 82 percent to secondary mortality.&#13;
3.     Application of chemotherapy for curing TB can have large benefits relative to the&#13;
costs. There are, however, alternative treatments which can be followed. In this project,&#13;
short term chemotherapy with directly-observed treatment (DOT) is to replace standard&#13;
chemotherapy. Several of the determinants of both the costs and benefits of these two&#13;
approaches differ significantly. It is important, therefore, to provide estimates of the relative&#13;
cost effectiveness of each.&#13;
4.     TB is generally regarded as an illness of middle age adults with the highest incidence&#13;
among the 25-44 year age group. This is the age group not only parenting but also at the&#13;
peak of its labor productivity. Most of the burden of disease resulting from TB comes from&#13;
mortality.' Of all avoidable adult deaths in developing countries, 26 percent are due to TB.&#13;
Children in households in Bangladesh where one parent is suffering from a debilitating&#13;
disease, such as TB, are two and a half times more likely to be severely malnourished.2The&#13;
economic and social cost of TB is very high.&#13;

Annex 13&#13;
5.     Prior to discussing the relative cost effectiveness of alternative regimens of&#13;
chemotherapy for the treatment of TB, a brief description is provided of two major strategies&#13;
for preventing the disease: BCG vaccination and isoniazid chemoprophylaxis. BCG is given&#13;
at birth in most developing countries. However, given that TB is transmitted by sputum&#13;
positive cases and the age distribution of these cases, it is clear that even complete BCG&#13;
coverage will have little effect on the annual risk of infection - reducing total TB mortality&#13;
by under I0 percent. A second preventative approach would be to administer isoniazid&#13;
chemoprophylaxis to individuals with the tuberculosis infection. However, since only 6-8&#13;
percent of these cases evolve into clinical TB, the cost per death averted would be very high.&#13;
No studies have been made in developing countries. One for developed countries produced&#13;
estimates of US$1700 per case averted in developed countries.3&#13;
6.     The project focuses on passive case detection using sputum examination. The&#13;
alternative approaches of active case detection and radiology would each be very expensive&#13;
and the latter has been shown to be often unreliable in developing countries as the system&#13;
cannot respond to the generated demand. In addition the approach does not allow for&#13;
differentiation between infectious and non-infectious cases.&#13;
7.     The alternative treatment regimens are conventional or chemotherapy (roughly a 12&#13;
months course of a particular drug combination) and short course chemotherapy (roughly a&#13;
six month course of a more potent drug combination ). The effectiveness of each depends on&#13;
(a) the cure rate, (b) the acquired drug resistance, and (c) the impact on the trend of the risk&#13;
of infection. Of these, the cure rate is the most important. Ideally administered courses of&#13;
both treatments have high cure rates (around 95 percent) - therefore compliance with the&#13;
treatment is the most important determinant of the cure rate. The social assessments&#13;
undertaken for the project suggest that poverty is a main reason for non-compliance. In&#13;
addition, duration of treatment generally appears to be important. This is a major advantage&#13;
of short course chemotherapy. A third determinant is the degree of supervision and the&#13;
overall strength of the delivery system. A crucial aspect of the project (as in most programs&#13;
of short course chemotherapy) is the inclusion of DOT - directly-observed therapy - three&#13;
times a week for the first 2/3 months with observed treatment once a week thereafter. DOT&#13;
is more crucial to the success of short term than standard chemotherapy since incomplete&#13;
treatment results in greater possibilities for developing resistance to the drugs in the short&#13;
course regimen. Supervision increases costs. In addition, the drugs required for short-course&#13;
chemotherapy often are more expensive. The central issue arises of whether the higher costs&#13;
of the short-course treatment compared to those of the standard course are compensated for&#13;
by increased effectiveness.&#13;
Existing Studies&#13;
8.     Cost-effectiveness studies of TB treatment have been made only for Indonesia and,&#13;
more recently and in more detail, for three countries of East Africa4. The former set reported&#13;

cost per case treated while the latter also considered cost per death averted. The East African&#13;
studies are particularly thorough and provide a base for the economic analysis of the&#13;
proposed project in India. In addition, data resulting from the Indian pilot projects have been&#13;
incorporated in the analysis.&#13;
9.     Aside from the patient's opportunity cost of time and the cost of transport incurred in&#13;
receiving treatment, the costs of a TB program is comprised of various types: fixed costs&#13;
associated with the use of facilities outside of the program, e.g., hospitals; fixed costs&#13;
associated with the program itself, e.g., salaries, vehicles, equipment; and variable costs,&#13;
depending on the number of patients treated and monitored, e.g., sputum tests and drugs.&#13;
The average incremental costs, defined as variable costs plus fixed costs directly attributable&#13;
to the program, are focused on here.&#13;
10.    Cost estimates based on detailed analysis were made for four types of treatment -&#13;
short-course and standard chemotherapy, with and without an initial two month period of&#13;
hospitalization.&#13;
l1.   The benefits of chemotherapy for smear positive patients include those for the patient&#13;
treated and those resulting from reduced transmission. As described above, based on the&#13;
stable transmission pattern, these have been calculated as the aversion of 5.2 deaths (or 3.8&#13;
deaths using a discount rate of 3% a year) using life tables for treated and untreated subjects&#13;
and allowing for a spontaneous cure rate of 30 percent. Effective cure rates were calculated&#13;
(from detailed records) at 90 percent for the short course treatment and 65 percent for&#13;
standard programs.&#13;
12.   The results of the cost-effectiveness calculations are shown below. They cover cost&#13;
per cure, death averted and year of life saved for each of the four alternative programs (short&#13;
and standard course chemotherapy, with and without hospitalization) averaged across the&#13;
three East African countries (US$):&#13;
Short Course                     Standard Course&#13;
Hospital       Ambulatory         Hospital        Ambulatory&#13;
Per cure         US$188            US$96            US$292            US$100&#13;
Per death         US$46             US$23            US$69             US$25&#13;
averted&#13;
Per year of l ife&#13;
saved&#13;
US$2.1           US$1.0           US$3.0            US$1.1&#13;
13.    On the basis of the cost estimates, the reported cure rates and the pattern of disease&#13;
transmission in these countries, treatment of TB appears to be highly cost-effective when&#13;
effectiveness is measured in terms of deaths averted and years of life saved. When effective&#13;
supervision can be designed and implemented in a way which does not require inpatient&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 13&#13;
services in hospitals, the costs are particularly low. In both situations (with hospitalization&#13;
and without), the cost effectiveness of the short-course regimen is highest.&#13;
14.   A more recent study of cost effectiveness of health care interventions has been&#13;
undertaken by the World Bank across five East African countries. Results for the treatment&#13;
of TB in Ethiopia indicate lower levels of cost effectiveness than the studies reported above.&#13;
Cost per life year saved was estimated at US$7.6 for short course treatment and US$19 for&#13;
the standard course. Treatment involving hospitalization was significantly more costly per&#13;
life year saved - US$21.8 for short course treatment. These estimates, while higher than&#13;
previous ones, should be compared to those made by the same authors for other health&#13;
interventions e.g. AIDS preventive US$198 and curative US$45,394; malaria preventive&#13;
US$1,106 and curative US$48; cardiovascular disease preventive US$637 and curative&#13;
US$283.&#13;
15     Summarizing, on the basis of the most detailed studies currently available:&#13;
(a)    chemotherapy for sputum positive TB patients is the cheapest of all health&#13;
interventions available in developing countries per death averted and per year&#13;
of life saved;&#13;
(b)    short course chemotherapy is even more cost effective than the standard&#13;
course; and,&#13;
(c)   the short course is also preferable since the effectiveness cure rate is higher&#13;
and fewer patients will require the higher cost retreatment program in the&#13;
future.&#13;
Cost Effectiveness in India&#13;
16.    The cost-effectiveness calculations reported above for three East African countries&#13;
resulted from intensive case studies over a lengthy period of time. In many respects the&#13;
results will be quite robust across other developing countries, including India. For instance,&#13;
the transmission rates and the age structure of patients will be similar - hence the benefits in&#13;
terms of deaths averted and years of life saved from a single cure will not be greatly&#13;
different. However, the costs of the program in India may differ (for instance, the cost of&#13;
drugs for the short course has fallen recently) while the effective cure rates of each regimen&#13;
may also vary from those recorded in East Africa.&#13;
Effective Cure Rate&#13;
17.    Cure rates in India are very low compared to those achieved, even by standard&#13;
therapy, in East Africa. According to the National Tuberculosis Institute, cure rates for the&#13;
standard treatment are 20 percent and for the short course (currently unsupervised) 30&#13;
percent. In a study of 1 8 districts in Tamil Nadu. the highest cure rate for (again virtually&#13;
unsupervised) short-course chemotherapy was 50 percent and for the standard regimen, 35&#13;
percent. Provisional data from the pilot projects of DOT short-course treatment suggests&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 125 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
cure rates of around 80 percent. This should increase. The cure rate in China, with DOT&#13;
short course chemotherapy, is 92 percent.&#13;
18.    For India, neither the costs nor the cure rates, which will result from the new&#13;
regimen, can be known in great detail. Current knowledge based on the pilot projects,&#13;
however, suggests the following:&#13;
(a)  On the basis of the early results from the pilot projects, cure rates of short-&#13;
course chemotherapy are likely to be similar to those in East Africa (90%).&#13;
Cure rates from standard treatment are lower in India (20-35 percent) than&#13;
those in East Africa (60-66 percent). Consequently, the number of deaths&#13;
averted and years of life saved per treated case will be similar for short course&#13;
treatment as in East Africa, but the improvement in these measures resulting&#13;
from a switch from standard therapy will be greater.&#13;
(b)  The cost per case treated in East Africa included an estimate for drugs in the&#13;
short course regimen of US$40. For the current project, the drugs package will&#13;
be around US$12.80.&#13;
(c)  The evidence strongly suggests that, mainly resulting from recent decreases in&#13;
the price of drugs, the cost of death averted and year of life saved in India&#13;
through the project's support for short course DOT chemotherapy will be lower&#13;
than even the estimates for East Africa, which themselves are regarded as&#13;
demonstrating among the highest returns on investments from health&#13;
interventions. In addition, the difference in the cost effectiveness of the short&#13;
course regimen compared to the standard approach is also expected to be larger&#13;
in India - partly due to the reduced differential in the price of the short course&#13;
and standard drug packages, and partly due to the poor results of the standard&#13;
treatment in India relative to those recorded in East Africa.&#13;
Monetary Benefits&#13;
19.   The Burden of Disease study for India, undertaken for the 1993 World Development&#13;
Report, indicated that tuberculosis is responsible for 3.7 percent of the country's total burden&#13;
of disease. Seen in another perspective this is eleven times more than malaria, six times&#13;
more than the tropical cluster of diseases and two and a half times more than AIDS. The&#13;
incidence of TB tends to peak among those in mid adulthood. This age group has the highest&#13;
level of labor productivity and is the group in which society has already invested the largest&#13;
amounts of human capital. In addition, studies in Bangladesh indicate that children of&#13;
parents with illnesses such as TB are two and a half times more likely to suffer severe&#13;
malnutrition. The economic and social costs of TB are likely to be high.&#13;
20     Results from the more recent and detailed Burden of Disease study for the state of&#13;
Andhra Pradesh provide more details of the destructive nature of the disease. Among the&#13;
causes of death in rural areas 1988-93, TB was exceeded only by bronchitis and heart attacks&#13;
for males, and by these illnesses plus fever, cancer and childbearing deaths among females.&#13;
For 1993, TB was responsible for 10 percent of all DALYs for males and just over 5 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 126 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
for females. Among the 15-45 year age group, TB was the leading cause of death among&#13;
both the urban and rural population. Twenty percent of all DALYs for males between 15 and&#13;
60 are caused by TB. For females the figure is 10 percent. TB is the major cause of death&#13;
among the economically active population.&#13;
21.   The population of India is roughly 920 million. Those regarded at risk (above five&#13;
years of age) number 798 million. Applying the results of discussions of expert groups&#13;
utilized for the burden of disease study in Andhra Pradesh across the whole country suggests&#13;
that 20 million TB symptomatics (2.5%) exist annually. Of these, 16.4% or 3.27 million&#13;
would develop the disease each year. Tuberculosis is not fatal for all those who contract the&#13;
disease. The spontaneous cure rate is roughly 30 %. Those requiring treatment would be 2.3&#13;
million. Sixty percent of these patients, or 1.4 million, are expected to seek treatment in the&#13;
public sector. Currently, WHO estimates that the cure rate for the standard chemotherapy&#13;
treatment in the public sector is 35%, implying that 480,000 patients are cured each year.&#13;
The expected cure rate from the RNTP regimen supported through the proposed project is&#13;
85%, implying that 1.2 million would be cured annually if the RNTP covers the entire&#13;
country. These rough figures suggest that if the RNTP was effectively adopted across the&#13;
country, an additional 720,000 patient cures would be achieved each year. Many, but not all,&#13;
of these patients would have died directly from the illness without proper treatment. WHO&#13;
estimates that 200,000 deaths per year would be averted if RNTP was adopted throughout the&#13;
country.&#13;
22.   The current project would not cover the whole country. Treatment under the RNTP&#13;
would be provided comprehensively across 102 districts. The project would also provide&#13;
partially for smear-positive patients in a further 203 districts and would provide drugs for the&#13;
conventional treatment of smear-positive patients in the final 154 districts. Estimations&#13;
suggest that by the final year of the project, over 840,000 patients would be cured annually&#13;
through treatment in the public sector.&#13;
23.   Estimates of lost output due to TB must be very approximate. For the purposes of&#13;
this exercise, annual average earnings are estimated at Rs.5,200 a year ( the daily rate for&#13;
agricultural laborers of Rs.20 a day for 260 days). It is also assumed that, on average, the&#13;
disease is contracted 20 years prior to the normal end of working life. Discounting at 10% a&#13;
year, the present value of lost outputs resulting from the deaths and continued disability of&#13;
TB patients is estimated at around Rs.40 billion. WHO estimates of the outcome of the&#13;
project in terms of reduced deaths and patients remaining alive but debilitated suggest that&#13;
this will fall to Rs.31 billion, saving US$257.0 million; and with full coverage of the RNTP&#13;
across the country to Rs.23 billion. Savings in lost output from reduced deaths alone would&#13;
be over Rs.5 billion, or US$142.0 million each year. As a result of the project, an almost&#13;
Rs.9 billion (US$260.0 million) would be saved following full implementation of the RNTP&#13;
in the whole country.&#13;
II. Financial Sustainability&#13;
24.   The National Tuberculosis Control Program is a centrally sponsored scheme. The&#13;
current modality for its funding is an equal sharing of the cost of drugs between the central&#13;
government and each state government. Salaries, transport and other related costs have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
borne by the state governments, in addition to the costs of other TB programs operated&#13;
outside of the National Program. The Project will finance a time-slice of the National&#13;
Program whose financial modality is planned to change. During the Project period, all drugs&#13;
and other incremental inputs provided for RNTP districts (102) will be fully funded by the&#13;
central government. In SCC districts (203), drugs for all sputum positive patients will be&#13;
fully funded together with some institutional strengthening inputs and training while drugs&#13;
for sputum negative patients will be financed by the state governments. In non SCC districts&#13;
the same arrangements will be made for financing the drugs while other interventions will be&#13;
more limited. The required state financing of part of the drug supplies in SCC and non SCC&#13;
districts will act as an incentive for the states to establish the conditions for altering the&#13;
treatment regime to the DOT one which entitles all drugs to be funded by GOI. This project&#13;
will provide support for five years by which time almost one third of the population will be&#13;
fully covered by the new regimen and a further 50 percent will live in districts which are&#13;
partially covered and on track to adopt and implement the new regimen. It is anticipated that&#13;
the time-frame to introduce the Revised Strategy for Tuberculosis Control across the whole&#13;
country will be 8-12 years. In the final set of districts, some institutional and training&#13;
programs will have begun to lay the base for further strengthening in the following years.&#13;
25.   GOI expenditure on the TB National Programme in 1995/96 was Rs.460 million&#13;
compared to Rs.160 million in 1991/92 when the initial preparations to alter the approach&#13;
were begun. This constitutes 4.4 percent of total central government health expenditure,&#13;
which in turn was equal to just 0.5 percent of its total expenditures. Currently, the GOI&#13;
finances the central administration of the Programme and 50% of drugs. Under the project,&#13;
drugs for all patients in the RNTP districts and for sputum positive patients in the SCC&#13;
districts will be centrally financed. The conventional drugs for sputum negative patients in&#13;
the SCC and non SCC districts will be financed outside of the project by GOI and the states.&#13;
Adequate funding of these drugs by the states will be a condition for receiving additional&#13;
support for the program. Overall, expenditures by GOI for continuing and strengthening&#13;
those activities currently provided for Programme administration plus its shares of drug&#13;
expenditures will result in the Government at least maintaining expenditures at pre project&#13;
levels.&#13;
26.   In the final year of the project, the total recurrent costs in the 102 RNTP project&#13;
districts are projected at around Rs.366 million (base costs). For SCC districts the recurrent&#13;
costs will be Rs.165 million. For non SCC districts there will be no recurrent costs under the&#13;
project. Overall recurrent costs in the final year of the project are projected to be Rs.531&#13;
million. If responsibility for recurrent costs revert to the states, they would average Rs.35&#13;
million across each of the fifteen major states. The average expenditure by health&#13;
departments across these states currently is around Rs.4,700 million. Assuming an annual&#13;
average growth rate of 4 percent through the life of the project this would rise to around&#13;
Rs.5,700. The additional expenditures required for the maintenance of the project would be&#13;
equivalent to well under 1 percent of each state's health budget.&#13;
27.    At least during the implementation of the Revised Strategy to the whole country, the&#13;
GOI will maintain full funding of drugs under the new regime in addition to funding 50&#13;
percent of conventional drugs. At the end of the project this would total Rs.830 million&#13;
equivalent to double GOIs 1995/96 expenditure. Given the small share of total health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 128 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
expenditures devoted to the TB program, the experiences of the central government in&#13;
maintaining higher expenditure across other disease programs in recent years plus the stated&#13;
intention to give increased priority to social sectors, it is not anticipated that the project will&#13;
be difficult to sustain.&#13;
28.   The project activities represent just the first phase in a National Program which will&#13;
cover all districts within the next 10-12 years. The 102 districts which will implement all&#13;
aspects of the RNTP during the Project period have a total population of 271 million.&#13;
Covering the whole population, with the same cost structure as in these districts, would&#13;
imply a recurrent cost in the year following the completed implementation of Rs. 1,227&#13;
million plus a drug bill of Rs.657 million. For 1995/96 the National Program budget (mainly&#13;
for drugs) was Rs.460 million ($13 million) for GOI and, by implication, a similar amount&#13;
was budgeted by the states. The reduction of the total national drugs bill by almost twenty&#13;
percent (Rs.800 - 657 million) at the end of the Project compared to the beginning reflects&#13;
the significant reduction in the cost per treatment of the drugs administered under the new&#13;
regimen. Whether the financing of drugs remains 100 percent covered by GOI or reverts to a&#13;
50:50 share with the states, the drugs bill should provide no problem regarding sustainability.&#13;
29.   The (non drugs) incremental recurrent costs of the RNTP strategy, however, will&#13;
increase when it is implemented across the country. For example, around 10 supervision&#13;
teams consisting of a laboratory technician and treatment supervisor will be required in each&#13;
district. For the 102 districts covering 30 percent of the population the incremental recurrent&#13;
costs are anticipated to be around Rs.366 million a year. Once the whole country is covered&#13;
by the Program the incremental recurrent cost would be around Rs.1,227 million. It is&#13;
envisaged that these costs will then be the responsibility of the states. Part of this may be&#13;
financed through savings. Currently the states are required to fund half the cost of drugs. In&#13;
the current year this is planned to total Rs.400 million. Under the new RNTP Programme&#13;
GOI may continue to fund drugs. The savings to the states would be equivalent to almost&#13;
one third of the incremental recurrent costs. The remaining costs, around Rs.800 million,&#13;
would be spread across all states, implying Rs.5.3 million for each of the major states.&#13;
Current health expenditures average around Rs.5,700 million in the major states. In ten&#13;
years time, assuming an annual growth rate of 4%, they would be around Rs.8,500 million.&#13;
Maintaining the TB program, therefore, implies an increase of around 0.6 percent in each&#13;
state's health budget. Even if the financing of the drugs bill did revert to a 50:50 share the&#13;
total increase in states' expenditures would not exceed one percent of their health budget.&#13;
This should not provide a problem.&#13;
30.   The experiences in recent years, however, indicate the need for some caution.&#13;
Taking Gujarat as an example, drugs for the national TB program form 0.13 percent of&#13;
current health department expenditures. Even a doubling of the drugs budget (unlikely, due&#13;
to the steeply falling drug procurement prices which should also lower the cost of non-&#13;
project drug supplies) would still result in a very small share. In principle, there should be&#13;
no problem of sustainability. In practice, the decrease in real expenditures on drugs in&#13;
1992/93 and 1993/94 suggests a constraint in that state. Similarly, of the seven states&#13;
described in table 8, only Karnataka and Maharashtra significantly increased their&#13;
expenditures on TB drugs between 1991/92 and 1993/94. In Kerala, expenditures are very&#13;
low and the other three states' real expenditures fell. More optimistically, the new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129-&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
procedures for drug procurement will result in much lower prices than the states have paid in&#13;
the past, thereby resulting in savings on existing expenditures. Again, the incremental&#13;
recurring costs of the project to the states will be such that they will form a very small part of&#13;
the total budget and, in principle, should easily be sustained.&#13;
Central and State Government Expenditures on Tuberculosis Programs&#13;
31.    Per capita expendituies on disease control programs are very low. In 1993/94, only&#13;
in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and Tamil Nadu were they above Rs. I 0. In four states they&#13;
were between Rs.7 and Rs.lO and in the remaining eight states, between Rs.5 and Rs.7.&#13;
Average per capita expenditure was Rs.8. Expenditures are made by both the central and&#13;
state governments. State government expenditures are much higher but tend to concentrate&#13;
on funding personnel. The central government programs concentrate resources on other&#13;
recurrent inputs, particularly drugs.&#13;
Centrally Sponsored Schemes&#13;
32.   Central government expenditures on disease programr.s, such as the national TB&#13;
program, are made through centrally-sponsored schemes, in which grants - 100% or&#13;
matching 50% - are distributed across the state governments. The national programs for&#13;
blindness, leprosy, goiter and AIDS are funded 100% by the central government, while TB,&#13;
malaria and filaria are funded 50:50 by the central and state governments. Expenditures on&#13;
each of the major disease programs and on the total public health budget, which mainly&#13;
comprises of the disease programs, between 1987/88 and 1995/96, is presented in Table 1.&#13;
The public health budget is also described as a share of total central government&#13;
expenditures on health.&#13;
33.   The data in Table I indicate that, overall, expenditures on disease programs have&#13;
increased in importance in recent years compared to total health expenditures by the central&#13;
government. Among the programs, the greatest increase in emphasis has been given to&#13;
leprosy and blindness, and, most recently, to AIDS. All three have been supported through&#13;
development assistance. In 1995/96, expenditures on malaria suddenly increased. While&#13;
expenditures on the TB program have also increased much more rapidly than overall health&#13;
expenditures, the growth has not matched that of the other disease programs.&#13;
34.   The TB centrally sponsored scheme is based on the principle of matching&#13;
expenditures for drugs by the central government and the state governments. The following&#13;
steps occur:&#13;
(a)   states make their applications for drugs on the basis of their estimates of total&#13;
requirements.&#13;
(b)   the center analyzes the applications and makes an assessment of its (50%)&#13;
contribution based on the judged requirement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130-&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
(c)   since the budgetary allocation to the Department of Health for this item&#13;
program are normally below that "required", pro rata reductions are made&#13;
across the states.&#13;
(d)   states are meant to fund the other 50% of the requirement for drugs (plus the&#13;
other recurrent costs required to administer the program).&#13;

35.   In addition to an overall underfunding of drug 'requirements' by the center, the&#13;
allocations to states are under or over spent in individual states. In 1990/91 and 1992/93,&#13;
overall expenditures were 91 and 95 percent of total allocations; in several states,&#13;
expenditures were significantly above budgeted allocations, and vice-versa. In 1991/92,&#13;
overall expenditures were only just over 50% of the allocation and was again below in&#13;
1993/94. A number of reasons may explain the discrepancy:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
(a)    the central ministry procurement unit can be slow to instruct suppliers - this&#13;
would lead to a rollover in the following year.&#13;
(b)    for a number of reasons, including an increase in the market price above the&#13;
tender price, suppliers do not deliver the contracted amounts to the depots.&#13;
(c)    the six depots across the country are unable to distribute supplies in the&#13;
planned way.&#13;
36.    The 1995/96 allocation for the central government's contribution for the procurement&#13;
of drugs was Rs.40 crores ($1 1.5 million) compared to Rs.13 and Rs.26 crores in 1990/91&#13;
and 1992/93 respectively. The budget estimate for 1996/97 is Rs.63 crores&#13;
State Government Expenditures&#13;
37.    While the project will provide some inputs widely across the country, the center&#13;
piece will be the 102 districts in fifteen states in which the new approach is expected to be&#13;
adopted in its entirety. In order to provide a context for assessing the absolute and relative&#13;
expenditures on tuberculosis programs, a sample of states was drawn and their budget&#13;
documents analyzed to assess the levels and sources of these expenditures. Table 2 on page&#13;
132 describes total health expenditures and those on disease control per capita and as a share&#13;
of total government revenue expenditures in which the project will initially operate.&#13;
38.    Across the project states in 1993/94, health expenditures as a share of total&#13;
government revenue expenditures averaged 6.1 percent within a range of 5.3 and 8.1 percent.&#13;
There was little change over the previous three years. These shares converted to an average&#13;
per capita expenditures of Rs.66 in 1991/2 and Rs.82 (US$2.6) in 1993/4. The range in&#13;
1993/4 was from Rs.49 and Rs.50 in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to over Rs.80 in Karnataka,&#13;
Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, to Rs.105 in Kerala and Rs.197 in Himachel Pradesh. On&#13;
average, around II percent of health expenditures are spent on disease programs. This&#13;
translated to an average per capita expenditures in 1993/4 of under Rs.9 (US$0.29) with over&#13;
half of the states recording expenditures of between Rs.5 and Rs.7. Only in Andhra Pradesh,&#13;
Tamil Nadu and Himachel Pradesh were per capita expenditures above Rs.1O.&#13;
39.   In most of the centrally-sponsored schemes in disease control, the core principle is&#13;
that the central government funds 50% or a 100% of drugs. These amounts are shown in&#13;
states' budgets as plan expenditures. In the former case the state government is required to&#13;
fund a similar amount of drugs - again, usually recorded under plan expenditures; plus the&#13;
other, mainly salary and transport, costs of operating the programs under non-plan&#13;
expenditure. All expenditures are not necessarily under the most obvious budget head. The&#13;
most detailed attempt to calculate central and state government expenditures on public health&#13;
programs was made for 1992/93 in 12 districts in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and&#13;
West Bengal (NCAER, 1994). The central government's share averaged 19, 10, 8 and 16&#13;
percent respectively - or an average across the 12 districts of 17%. These figures imply that&#13;
even though the central government helps fund a variety of disease control programs the&#13;
state governments, through their funding of the basic health service infrastructure, remain the&#13;

40.   The results of the NCAER study of 12 districts can only be indicative of the overall&#13;
situation for public health programs within each of the four states, and across all states.&#13;
However, more recent data for Gujarat tend to corroborate the conclusion: in spite of the&#13;
national TB program contributed to by the central government, the large majority of the&#13;
resources spent on TB treatment is directly provided by the states. Table 3 presents central&#13;
and state government allocations and expenditures on the TB program between 1989/90 to&#13;
1993/94 using information provided by the state goverment. During that period, central&#13;
government expenditures ranged between 16% and 3% of the total. However, the change in&#13;
the composition of expenditures funded by the two levels of government indicates a growing&#13;
problem. Until 1991/92 the state government was matching the central government's&#13;
expenditures on drugs. In the following two years, as the center's expenditures rose&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 133 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
substantially, the state only maintained its previous allocations for drugs while increaseing&#13;
(nominal) expenditures on the other mainly salary, items. The implication is that while the&#13;
state has historically developed services for TB treatment, it is finding the provision of&#13;
additional resources, for drugs, increasingly difficult.&#13;

41.   As a share of total state non-plan expenditures on public health in Gujarat, state&#13;
expenditures on the TB program in 1993/94 were 5.4%. As a share of all medical and public&#13;
health non-plan expenditures, they were 1.2%. As a share of all plan and non-plan health&#13;
expenditures, they were 0.8%. These are small shares. Expenditures on drugs form only one&#13;
sixth of all expenditures on TB. During the project, incremental expenditures for both drugs&#13;
and other inputs will be fully funded by the central government in RNTP districts. Hence,&#13;
there should be no additional burden on the states. At the end of the project, the expectation&#13;
is that the activities will be financed on the basis of the 'normal' 50:50 central and state&#13;
government shares. Drugs for TB currently form 0.13% of health department expenditures.&#13;
Even a doubling of the drugs budgets (unlikely, due to the steeply falling drug procurement&#13;
prices which have lowered the cost of drugs for the new regimen below that for conventional&#13;
drugs) would still result in a very small share. In principle, there should be no problem of&#13;
sustainability. In practice, however, the decrease in nominal expenditures on drugs in&#13;
1992/93 and 1993/94 is a cause for concern and does suggest that overall allocations to the&#13;
health sector needs to be protected in real terms.&#13;
42.   The situation in Gujarat and the conclusions arrived at above are similar to those for&#13;
most other states. Tables 4 and 5 provide expenditure data on national and state&#13;
expenditures, public health and all activities under the departments of health between&#13;
19991/92 and 1993/94 for Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, respectively.&#13;
43.   Again, expenditures on TB in Andhra Pradesh constitute very small shares - around&#13;
0.5 percent of total expenditures and 2.8 percent of public health expenditures. The leprosy&#13;
and malaria programs are much larger. Plan expenditures on TB are for drugs - and are less&#13;
than one percent of plan health expenditures. Non-plan recurring expenditures are six to&#13;
seven times the size of the state's TB drug budget. If TB drugs had been provided on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
50:50 formula in 1992/93, central government expenditures would have been equal to just&#13;
over 11 percent of total expenditures on TB in the state.&#13;

46.   Finally, focusing specifically on medicines in the TB programs, data provided by the&#13;
state governments of Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and&#13;
West Bengal convey a generally common experience (Table 8). Until 1991/92, the state&#13;
governments (apart from Kerala) were generally matching central government expenditures.&#13;
In the following two years, while most state government expenditures continued to increase,&#13;
they did not match the increases in central govemnment expenditures apart from Karnataka&#13;
and Maharashtra.&#13;

47.   Summarizing the situation across the five states described in tables 3 to 7,&#13;
expenditures on the treatment of TB average around 2 percent of total health expenditures.&#13;
Non-plan expenditures are higher than plan expenditures in all cases - considerably so in&#13;
some states. This corroborates the earlier observation that state government expenditures on&#13;
this activity are much higher than those of the central government. The shift since 1992/93&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137-&#13;
Annex 13&#13;
in the balance between states' and central governments' expenditures on medicines,&#13;
however, indicates that while the states have been able to maintain expenditures on salaries,&#13;
they have not matched the increases provided by the center for medicines. Within the cluster&#13;
of disease programs, there are considerable variations in the priorities given to specific&#13;
diseases across states, both in plan and non-plan expenditures.&#13;
Summary&#13;
48.   Disease control expenditures are equivalent to around 10-12 percent of total state&#13;
health expenditures on average. Average expenditure per capita is Rs.8.&#13;
49.   While many disease programs are supported by the central government, the state&#13;
governments contribute the majority of resources to public health activities. A study of 12&#13;
districts across three states showed that in 1992/93, the central governments' average share&#13;
was 12 percent. Non plan expenditures on TB are much higher than plan expenditures -&#13;
considerably so in several states - implying that state government activity dominates in the&#13;
treatment of TB, despite the centrally supported national program.&#13;
50.   Between 1989/90 and 1993/94, the central government contributed between 16 and&#13;
23 percent of expenditures on TB control in Gujarat. However, while total state government&#13;
expenditures on TB have increased each year, expenditures on drugs have decreased since&#13;
1991/92.&#13;
5 1.   More generally, across a sample of seven states, while the states were able to almost&#13;
match the central government's expenditures on drugs until 1991/92, only in Karnataka and&#13;
Maharashtra has this situation been maintained.&#13;

Annex 15&#13;
INDIA: Tuberculosis Control Project&#13;
OUTLINE OF PLAN OF ACTION FOR DELIVERY OF TB SERVICES IN&#13;
TRIBAL' AREAS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1 .    There is a sizable population of tribals scattered in the various districts throughout&#13;
the country. Due to the various characteristics of the tribals and the constraints faced by&#13;
them, the Government of India has adopted a broad strategy in the health sector through&#13;
the concepts of the Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) and Tribal Sub-Plan&#13;
(TSP) in the Fifth Five Year Plan. The Modified Area Development Agency (MADA)&#13;
was included in the Sixth Five-Year Plan where even smaller pockets of tribals were&#13;
identified and resources allocated. In the Seventh Five-Year Plan, the TSP was extended&#13;
to all the Tribals including those dispersed due to various factors.&#13;
Basic Norms in the Health Sector for Tribal Areas&#13;
2.    The basic health sector norms have been modified for the tribal areas. A Primary&#13;
Health Center (PHC) has been recommended at 20,000 population instead of at 30,000&#13;
population and a sub-center at 3,000 population instead of the usual 5,000 population. A&#13;
DOT provider, preferably from the same tribe will be selected and trained to provide&#13;
services per 1,000 population or two DOT providers for areas where population is&#13;
between 1,500 and 2,000. Within this overall framework, specific provisions will be&#13;
made to ensure that tribal populations have access to TB services and receive full and&#13;
effective treatment.&#13;
Characteristics of Tribal Areas&#13;
3.    Tribal populations have their own distinctive life styles and attitudes towards&#13;
health and its providers. They are also distinctive geographically and socially.&#13;
(a)    Topography of Tribal Areas.&#13;
(1)    Most Tribals live in far flung, remote areas, usually cut off from&#13;
the outside world during the monsoon and winter seasons. Their&#13;
villages/hamlets are usually in mountainous, hilly areas or in&#13;
forests. This makes road connections and communication difficult&#13;
which further isolates this population from the mainstream.&#13;
The term "Tribal" is the terminology used in the Indian Constitution to refer to indigenous groups who are&#13;
currently living or have emigrated from isolated and remote areas and have distinctive social, cultural and&#13;
economic characteristics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 154 -&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
(2)    Because it is their ancestral land, tribals prefer to remain in these&#13;
isolated areas and often maintain a strict vigil to prevent intrusion&#13;
by other tribals and government officials. Many tribal groups live&#13;
in small hamlets consisting only of their tribe to try to protect their&#13;
land based on their notion of self-sufficiency on food, livestock&#13;
and forest product. These unique characteristics create major&#13;
challenges for health care providers in bringing health services to&#13;
tribal groups.&#13;
(b)    Socio-Economic Status.&#13;
(1)    Most tribal groups depend on their agricultural products for their&#13;
livelihood which are often meager due to traditional methods of&#13;
cultivation or over exploitation of the land.&#13;
(2)    There is a disproportionately high rate of illiteracy among tribal&#13;
populations, their overall educational status is poor, and because of&#13;
their adherence to traditional healing practices they have little&#13;
knowledge of biomedical health care which is the only proven&#13;
method to deal with infectious diseases.&#13;
(3)    The practice of traditional medicine based on tribal concept of&#13;
health and disease has led to delay in diagnosis and proper&#13;
treatment of many preventable, communicable diseases, especially&#13;
Tuberculosis.&#13;
(c).   Health Facilities.&#13;
(1)    Despite additional inputs through modified health infrastructure&#13;
norms in tribal areas, there is poor delivery of health services. This&#13;
is due to lack of the available government health staff to serve in&#13;
these posts. Moreover, reduced priority at the local level results in&#13;
deficiency of even basic health facilities in these areas.&#13;
(2)    This has resulted in the tribals losing confidence in the government&#13;
health services and it has further deteriorated the interaction&#13;
between health staff and tribal populations. The situation is&#13;
particularly serious because most tribals rely on the government for&#13;
health care when they seek allopathic treatment.&#13;
(3)    The social assessments conducted in tribal areas identified specific&#13;
issues affecting tribal populations in relation to TB. The following&#13;
strategy is designed to address these issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 15&#13;
Strategy for Revised NTP (RNTP) in Tribal Areas&#13;
4.    Additional inputs in tribal areas are critical for implementing the RNTP. For an&#13;
operationally feasible and comprehensive approach, the following strategy is being&#13;
developed , which is based on respect for the Tribals' religious customs and habits, and&#13;
for their sentiments and ethnic preferences.&#13;
5.    As part of the eligibility criteria to participate in the RNTP, a district would need&#13;
to submit detailed plans to implement the strategy in tribal areas within the overall&#13;
framework described here and the attached plan of action outline. This includes:&#13;
(a)   Identifying and classifying tribal groups:&#13;
(1) according to their ecological habitat, especially in remote,&#13;
mountainous terrain and deep forests and their degree of contact with&#13;
the outside world; and&#13;
(2) according to their social and economic characteristics and their&#13;
quality of life.&#13;
(b)    Developing a community-based approach for mobilization and&#13;
motivation to seek TB treatment, as tribal life style is mainly community&#13;
oriented and selecting appropriate individuals to carry out this task.&#13;
(c)   Involving Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) or community groups&#13;
active in tribal areas on whom tribals have confidence.&#13;
(d)   Involving specially trained personnel who are familiar with the tribals and&#13;
have their trust.&#13;
(e)    Developing Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities&#13;
that take into account the tribal life style, culture, language, and relevant&#13;
social practices and are consistent with their attitudes and perceptions.&#13;
(f)    Selecting health providers, especially Village Health Guides, from&#13;
the same tribal communities.&#13;
(g)   Increasing NTP services by opening more microscopic centers,&#13;
supervisory teams, proper logistic method for buffer drug stocks and&#13;
proper transportation to avoid bottlenecks in communications.&#13;
Operational Components of Revised Strategy in Tribal Areas&#13;
6.    For operationally feasibility the walking time for a patient to the nearest health&#13;
center should not be more than one hour, this would be achieved by:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 156 -&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
(a) decentralizing diagnostic facilities and establishing microscopy centers at&#13;
around 50,000 population instead of the norm of one lakh (100,000)&#13;
population;&#13;
(b) establishing Tuberculosis Units (sub-district supervisory teams) at one per 2.5&#13;
lakh population instead of the usual norm of one per 5.0 lakh population;&#13;
(c) adequate transport facilities to ensure a proper inventory system for&#13;
uninterrupted supply of drugs and materials throughout the year;&#13;
(d) increased involvement of peripheral health functionaries, preferably from the&#13;
youth within the same tribal group, to ensure better understanding of the&#13;
system and compliance with the RNTP;&#13;
(e) increased involvement of the NGOs already working in the tribal area for TB&#13;
work;&#13;
(f) adequate budgetary provision for traveling allowances for staff and for Petrol,&#13;
Oil, Lubricants (POL) and maintenance of vehicles to ensure proper&#13;
monitoring and supervision;&#13;
(g) development of DOT models to enable patients to have acceptable, convenient&#13;
drug taking during times of the year when the communities are isolated;&#13;
(h) Operational Research activities by multi-disciplinary study groups especially&#13;
in the areas of relevant tribal perceptions, social structures, practices and&#13;
economic relationships and finding alternative ways of service delivery&#13;
keeping these in view; and&#13;
(i) a Multi-Disciplinary Advisory Committee at the Central, State and District&#13;
Levels to review and evaluate periodically the RNTP in tribal areas.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
7.    Delivery of services under the RNTP in tribal areas call for a coordinated effort by&#13;
all sections of the health and social welfare providers keeping in mind the basic concept&#13;
of the tribal's life style and socio-cultural characteristics. To achieve these objectives, the&#13;
plan of action shown on page 157 has been proposed.&#13;

INDIA: Tuberculosis Control Project&#13;
SOCIAL ASSESSMENTS&#13;
1.    Two social assessments of tuberculosis (TB) in India were commissioned by the&#13;
Government of India (GOI), as part of project preparation, with financial assistance from&#13;
the Japan Grant Funds and Dutch Trust Funds managed by the World Bank. One study of&#13;
the socio-cultural factors related to TB among tribal populations was conducted by the&#13;
Foundation for Research and Development of Underprivileged Groups (New Delhi), in&#13;
selected tribal-dominated districts of Gujarat, West Bengal, Bihar and Himachal Pradesh.&#13;
The second assessment was aimed at providing in-depth knowledge and understanding of&#13;
the issues concerning TB among slum populations in the selected cities of Bangalore,&#13;
Pune, Jaipur, Lucknow and Hyderabad. This study was conducted by FEMCONSULT, a&#13;
Dutch organization who employed Indian researchers to carry out the field work. Both&#13;
quantitative and qualitative approaches were employed in carrying out these studies. The&#13;
findings were instrumental in the formulation of an effective strategy for the information,&#13;
education and communication (IEC) component of the project and the plan of action for&#13;
tribal populations as required by OD 4.20.&#13;
2.    The Studies. Some of the main differences of the findings of the tribal study from&#13;
those of the study conducted in slum populations are: (1) except for the state of Himachal&#13;
Pradesh, TB is not as stigmatized in tribal areas, as it is in slums; (2) the tribal people&#13;
studied go to public facilities and not to private doctors, whereas the slum dwellers tend&#13;
to rely on private practitioners; (3) in tribal areas, most of the newly posted physicians do&#13;
not speak the language nor understand the culture of the tribal patients which poses&#13;
problems to both patients and physicians; (4) although, in general, there is heavy reliance&#13;
on traditional healers in the tribal areas, this is not necessarily the case for TB.&#13;
3.    Compliance. Although the details of the findings differ in both study populations,&#13;
the main causes of people not completing their treatment are related to poverty. For&#13;
women, gender inequality is an added major factor affecting their treatment-seeking&#13;
behavior. The main economic factors that affect the treatment of TB are: (1) lack of&#13;
funds to pay for transportation; (2) lack of funds for medicines; (3) inability to sustain the&#13;
costs of treatment in the private sector; (4) inability of the patient to sustain loss of&#13;
income occasioned by having to collect medicines; in the case of women in tribal areas,&#13;
inability of the person(s) accompanying the patient to sustain loss of income; (5) women's&#13;
inability to control their movements and allocation of meager family finances; (6)&#13;
inability to continue the sick role to obtain medicines after symptoms abate; and (7) labor&#13;
migration. Those who do not abandon treatment either have enough money to complete&#13;
the course of treatment or, if they have no money at all, they have access to a competent&#13;
nearby NGO or a government facility providing free TB treatment. Another&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 160 -&#13;
Annex 16&#13;
cause of noncompliance includes lack of knowledge on the part of the patients of the&#13;
importance of continuing treatment even after symptoms disappear primarily because of&#13;
poor communication from service providers.&#13;
4.    Private doctors and traditional healers are perceived to play more of the healer&#13;
role than most government physicians. While in many instances, the perception of the&#13;
physician as an authority figure and as a healer seems to help patients to continue&#13;
treatment; in many other cases, patients are reprimanded by health providers for not&#13;
complying with treatment. However, the major problem in the relationship between&#13;
providers and patients seems to be the veil of secrecy around the diagnosis of&#13;
Tuberculosis. In many instances, private physicians, reluctant to tell the patient he or she&#13;
has TB because of the stigma associated with it in the urban areas, communicate a&#13;
different diagnosis such as "asthma". This is not the case with government physicians&#13;
because TB patients are either diagnosed at TB centers or referred to them when&#13;
diagnosed in other government facilities. Also related to stigma and the secrecy&#13;
associated with it, is the patients' tendency to hide the disease from others.&#13;
5.    Geography as well as climate prominently affect compliance and access to&#13;
treatment, particularly in the rural areas where inclement weather makes access to the&#13;
primary health center (PHC) almost impossible.&#13;
6.    The quality of medicines, their side effects, and price are also a factor in poor&#13;
treatment compliance. For example, some patients in cities become nauseated by taking&#13;
several pills at once on an empty stomach. While some patients report compliance&#13;
because medicines are free, others may need to be charged a small fee for the medicines&#13;
in order for them to value the drugs.&#13;
7.    Treatmen. Seeking Behavior. Most people with TB symptoms first seek out&#13;
private health care practitioners because: (1) private doctors are conveniently located; (2)&#13;
they are not very expensive; (3) they are perceived to treat patients more respectfully and&#13;
with more understanding than other health providers; (4) government free medicines are&#13;
perceived to be inferior to private physicians' or chemists' medicines; and lastly (5) the&#13;
patient wishes the privacy of treatment afforded by a private doctor.&#13;
8.    Although there are relatively few NGOs caring for TB patients, their services are&#13;
often highly valued and NGO physicians may be considered to be more caring and&#13;
dedicated than government health providers. Some NGOs that do not provide clinical&#13;
services to TB patients have outreach workers who educate the public about TB. It was&#13;
found that in almost all the slums, the presence of active outreach workers is correlated&#13;
with increased allopathic knowledge about TB. However, allopathic knowledge is not&#13;
correlated with decreased stigmatization of TB.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 161 -&#13;
Annex 16&#13;
9.    Government facilities with a good reputation for curing patients and maintaining a&#13;
good supply of all TB drugs attract patients from a wide area. Directly-observed therapy&#13;
(DOT), which is offered at some government facilities, seemed to greatly improve the&#13;
number of compliant or cured patients. It is not yet clear whether compliance under DOT&#13;
is related to the rigor of the supervision system associated with DOT or to the fact that&#13;
patients are receiving more attention from the service providers (the Hawthorn effect).&#13;
This would be an area for Operational Research under the project.&#13;
10.   Communication. Mass media play virtually no role in TB education. This is&#13;
mainly due to the lack of publicity on TB in the mass media. In slums, access to health&#13;
information through television and radio is spotty and varies by slum and gender. While&#13;
some slums have no electricity, there are others where most residents have access to&#13;
televisions, but women are too busy to watch or listen to television. Some slum residents&#13;
are literate and may read newspapers, while in many other slums people are mostly&#13;
illiterate.&#13;
11.  Information about TB and TB treatment facilities and treatment regimens is&#13;
spread by word of mouth by compliant and cured TB patients. Patients seem most likely&#13;
to complete the full treatment if they receive information and support from health&#13;
providers. Irrespective of the type of health care provider, the importance of enthusiastic&#13;
and committed health care personnel and sufficient funds to manage the TB program&#13;
seems to be key in program success.&#13;
12.   Community Perception of TB. TB is a stigmatized illness in all study areas,&#13;
although the degree of stigma varies greatly. In some areas with the least stigma, only&#13;
females in certain categories, such as unmarried girls and newly married nulliparous&#13;
women, experience stigma. It is the private doctor's respect for the stigma associated&#13;
with TB and its attendant secrecy that attract many TB sufferers to them.&#13;
13.   Due to stigmatization of the disease and beliefs that TB is contracted through&#13;
food, clothing, heredity, coughing, etc., TB patients are somewhat isolated in many areas.&#13;
Folk etiology of TB also varies widely. However, recognition that coughing may spread&#13;
TB is almost universal. In general, people say they regard TB as curable, although they&#13;
may not behave in accordance with this stated belief (e.g. by stigmatizing TB patients).&#13;
14.   Social Indicators. The basic indicator is the percentage of patients cured, although&#13;
there are other process-based social indicators that include economic, programmatic and&#13;
social factors that were discussed in the earlier paragraphs.&#13;
15.   Recommendations. Several recommendations came out of these social&#13;
assessment studies. They suggest that the current overall health systems be enhanced to&#13;
accommodate the TB patient and that the training given at all levels of the health delivery&#13;
system be strengthened with the TB patient in mind.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 162 -&#13;
Annex 16&#13;
16.   Furthermore, the studies suggest that communication be used as a powerful tool to&#13;
help health care providers and patients cure TB. Some of the suggestions on this front&#13;
included:&#13;
(a)   training in interpersonal communication for all public sector health care;&#13;
(b)   providers who interact with TB patients and counseling training for public&#13;
sector;&#13;
(c)    physicians, nurses and treatment supervisors;&#13;
(d)   in each local project area, design of pictorial materials for illiterate patients&#13;
that meet local needs and that contain detailed information on drug&#13;
regimens;&#13;
(e)    provision of stylish materials for private sector and NGO physicians for&#13;
promoting short course chemotherapy;&#13;
(f)    design of a program to utilize trained, cured and compliant patients in&#13;
DTCs, slums and villages;&#13;
(g)   use of the communication paradigm of education and providing&#13;
information to patients, rather than motivation, which does not seem to be&#13;
a factor affecting patient compliance; and finally&#13;
(h)   newly posted physicians going to tribal areas should, when feasible,&#13;
receive training from Indian anthropologists or people knowledgeable&#13;
about the local culture and local medical terms.&#13;

INDIA: Tuberculosis Control Project&#13;
INFORMATION, EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION (IEC)&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1 .    Health communication issues associated with tuberculosis differ from those of other&#13;
familiar health problems commonly addressed in India through IEC (e.g., family planning,&#13;
leprosy, blindness). The Revised National Tuberculosis Program is directed toward accurately&#13;
diagnosing TB among patients with symptoms and curing those with TB. Active case finding is&#13;
not a goal of the Program. IEC activities support and facilitate the Program's strategy of passive&#13;
case finding. Therefore, the strategy postpones and de-emphasizes mass media campaigns and&#13;
does not contain demand generation activities.&#13;
2.     The IEC strategy is based on social assessments1 of stakeholders perceptions of&#13;
tuberculosis, experiences with TB treatment, and desires for changes in how TB treatment is&#13;
provided. Continuation of extended drug treatment is problematic, particularly in TB, and&#13;
discontinuation rates in India have been high. Research indicates that much discontinuation has&#13;
been due to: (a) the unavailability of drugs; (b) expense of obtaining drugs from the private&#13;
sector; (c) monetary and logistic difficulties in transport to obtain public sector treatment and&#13;
drugs; and (d) lack of information (e.g., about treatment duration, patient flow) and&#13;
unsympathetic treatment by health care providers. Other portions of the Program have been&#13;
designed to remedy the situation described by the first three research findings (a,b,c). IEC&#13;
activities would address the last research finding (d).&#13;
3.     Research reveals also that most symptomatic patients (except in tribal areas) first seek&#13;
treatment from private licensed or unlicensed doctors. However, repeated consultations and&#13;
purchasing drugs are expensive. Consequently, patients stop treatment when they feel better.&#13;
Patients prefer private doctors for their convenient location and because these doctors seem to&#13;
have an interest in the patient and her/his cure. Public facilities are often expensive to get to and&#13;
public sector physicians may be perceived to be insensitive and uninterested in the patient.&#13;
4.     In addition, research indicates that compliant TB patients are usually those who have faith&#13;
in their physicians, have been told how and how long to take their medicines, have heard this&#13;
information repeatedly, and have heard the information from their physicians. Regimens for the&#13;
three categories of TB patients differ. In the absence of medical records, the physician must&#13;
I One social assessment was conducted in a total of 13 slums in five Indian cities by FEMCONSULT. The&#13;
assessment is entitled, "Social Assessment of Target Audiences in 13 Slums." The second social assessment&#13;
was conducted in among tribes in five different states by Dr. Salil Basu and his team of researchers. The&#13;
title of the tribal assessment is "Social Assessment Study: Perception, Attitude, Experience of Tribal&#13;
Communities vis-a-vis the Role of Health Providers for the Acceptability and Demand for Tuberculosis&#13;
Treatment in Tribal Areas."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 166 -&#13;
Annex 18&#13;
categorize each TB patient based on medical history interview findings. Mis-categorization of&#13;
patients will not result in a cure and may further promote drug resistance. However, good&#13;
interviewing or history taking skills are easily taught.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
5.    IEC will help to increase the cure rate through introducing a client-oriented perspective&#13;
into the health delivery system, especially among health providers. The objective is to improve&#13;
health care providers' interpersonal communication and counseling skills, including providing&#13;
TB patients with medically accurate and complete information on what the patient needs to do to&#13;
collaborate with the physician in achieving a cure. In order to meet this objective, all health&#13;
workers who interact with TB patients will receive training. Since research indicates that TB&#13;
patients may discontinue treatment-seeking or drug-taking based on negative experiences with&#13;
auxiliary personnel in health care facilities, all health workers (including auxiliary personnel)&#13;
should be trained in a patient-centered approach. For the purpose of this strategy, health workers&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)    Physicians&#13;
(b)   Nurses&#13;
(c)    Multipurpose health workers&#13;
(d)   Pharmacists&#13;
(e)    X-ray technicians&#13;
(f)    Laboratory technicians&#13;
(g)   Clerks&#13;
6.    Research findings also indicate that TB is stigmatized among many groups in India (e.g.,&#13;
in some slums and in some rural areas). TB patients in some areas report feeling isolated and&#13;
lonely. Women suffer most from stigmatization: husbands not uncommonly divorce their wives&#13;
when they are diagnosed with TB or temporarily send wives back to their parents, interrupting&#13;
drug therapy. Another objective of the strategy, therefore, is to decrease stigmatization through&#13;
use of cured TB patients for outreach to TB patients and their families, education of school&#13;
children, and eventually through limited use of mass media to reach all members of the&#13;
population, once the TB program is running well in most of the country. The objective is to&#13;
change patients' and community members' perception of the disease from an incurable, shameful&#13;
illness, to a serious, but curable disease like any other disease. This could result in tubercular&#13;
wives' unchanged status within the marriage and inclusion of non-infectious TB patients in the&#13;
community and family.&#13;
7.    The finding that TB is perceived to be incurable by many community members and&#13;
patients has been linked to failure to seek treatment or to comply with treatment in some cases.&#13;
Cured TB patients will be trained and employed as volunteers to support and educate TB patients&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 167 -&#13;
Annex 18&#13;
and their families, explain patient flow in health care facilities, and to serve as knowledgeable&#13;
resources within the community (a role which they already occupy informally). Programs for&#13;
school children will be aimed at education about TB as well as destigmatization of the disease.&#13;
This supports the previous objective, as well as helping to obviate the need for future active case&#13;
finding by educating children about TB symptoms, what to do about them, and destigmatizing&#13;
treatment-seeking for the disease.&#13;
Strategy&#13;
8.    Target audiences. The primary and secondary target audiences are as indicated below.&#13;
(a)    Government health care providers (including all the above categories, including&#13;
STOs).&#13;
(b)    Secondary target audiences include:&#13;
(1)   TB patients and their families;&#13;
(2)   Private and NGO doctors (from all medical traditions);&#13;
(3)   Central Health Education Bureau staff;&#13;
(4)    State/district mass media officers;&#13;
(5)   Outreach volunteers (cured TB patients or NGO volunteers); and,&#13;
(6)   Community members (including school children).&#13;
9.    A detailed national IEC strategy was developed during the preparation phase of the&#13;
project. Stakeholders are integrated into the strategy through inclusion of their views and&#13;
problems, as elicited in the two social assessments, and integration of the NGO community.&#13;
10.   Possible Key Messages. Messages should reflect the concerns and experiences of&#13;
stakeholders, support skills and supply information needed by physicians to facilitate their use of&#13;
short-course chemotherapy (SCC).&#13;
11.   The most important messages for physicians are:&#13;
(a)    Treat patients with respect and sympathy.&#13;
(b)   Listen to patients.&#13;
(c)    Tell the patient at each contact how long to continue treatment and what will&#13;
happen if the patient stops prematurely.&#13;
(d)   Express interest in patient's welfare and recovery.&#13;
12.   The most important messages for patients are:&#13;
(a)    TB is curable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 168 -&#13;
Annex 18&#13;
(b)   Take your medicine until the doctor tells you to stop.&#13;
(c)   You are not cured until the doctor tells you are cured, even if you feel well.&#13;
13.   A full summary of messages and channels by target audience appear below.&#13;
(a) Channels of information. The strategy relies on two main approaches to support&#13;
passive case finding and cure: training of health care providers and those providing&#13;
support for patients, and development of counseling and educational materials. Other&#13;
health care providers (e.g., laboratory technicians and multipurpose health workers)&#13;
should also receive audience pre-tested materials that facilitate their participation in&#13;
delivering SCC. Promotional materials should be developed for private and NGO&#13;
physicians to encourage accurate use of short course chemotherapy.&#13;
(b) Pretested, pictorial materials for patients that explain health care facility use and SCC&#13;
procedures may be developed. In addition, meaningful local rituals or symbolic items&#13;
could be developed to indicate a patient's commitment to finish treatment and a&#13;
doctor's commitment to the patient and his/her cure. A ritual or symbolic gift could&#13;
also be developed to visually represent that a patient has completed treatment and is&#13;
cured. Mass media may be employed to aid in decreasing the stigma of TB once&#13;
services are in place and functioning well throughout most of the country. Health&#13;
education and games for school children will also be important in destigmatizing and&#13;
educating about TB for the future.&#13;
(c) A secondary approach to support passive case finding is the use of mass media and&#13;
health educators to encourage a more accepting climate in the community for TB&#13;
sufferers. The approach would be based on: (a) promoting the concept that TB is&#13;
curable; and (b) sensitizing community members to the difficulties faced by TB&#13;
patients.&#13;
Monitoring System&#13;
14.   All behavioral changes among health care workers should be observed through a&#13;
supervisory system of direct observation of patient care by staff members' supervisors, who have&#13;
received training in supervising for interpersonal communication (IPC) and counseling.&#13;
Interpersonal communication and counseling (IPC/C) supervisory skills of MOHFW staff and&#13;
actual patient/staff interaction should be monitored by direct observation during site visits by the&#13;
National Program team. Interviews with patients selected at random from patient lists and&#13;
conducted at periodic intervals (e.g., yearly) in patients' homes by qualitative researchers would&#13;
also provide a measure of patients' perceptions of health providers and could detect how provider&#13;
training affects patients' compliance. These interviews could also be used to gauge the effect of&#13;
the Program, including any mass communication activities, on, for example, stigmatization of&#13;
female TB patients.&#13;
15.   Outreach volunteers' role in achieving a higher cure rate could be monitored by direct&#13;
observation by their supervisors (e.g., multipurpose health workers or a designated IPC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 169 -&#13;
Annex 18&#13;
supervisor within a health care facility). Volunteers could also be monitored through patient&#13;
interviews to assess patients' knowledge about TB and its treatment, their sources of knowledge,&#13;
and the volunteer's role in patient satisfaction. Records should be kept by the volunteer on the&#13;
number of patients contacted, and these should be checked by a supervisor.&#13;
16.   Materials that have been in use for at least six months should be evaluated by an outside&#13;
research organization. Materials should be evaluated every two years and new materials&#13;
developed if necessary (based on research findings). Information on patients, health care&#13;
providers, and community members' perceptions of TB already exists. However, in some cases it&#13;
may be necessary to conduct baseline rapid research studies in a few rural areas where data have&#13;
not previously been collected.&#13;
17.   The success rate of the IEC component may be inferred through:&#13;
(a)    Comparison of increased cure rates in concert with increased patient satisfaction;&#13;
(b)   Proportion of TB patients who come to government facilities for treatment based&#13;
on recommendations of current or cured patients;&#13;
(c)    Percentage of TB patients per district and state who report that they do not feel&#13;
that they are treated differently (e.g., avoided or isolated) due to TB;&#13;
(d)   Decrease in female TB patients who report that TB has decreased their chances of&#13;
marrying or remaining married; and,&#13;
(e)    Gradual increase in patient load in microscopy centers.&#13;
Implementation&#13;
18.   Implementation activities would be divided into five components:&#13;
(a)    Training (including curriculum development, training management, and&#13;
conducting training);&#13;
(b)   Materials development (including planning, designing, Pre-testing to obtain input&#13;
from stakeholders and those who influence them, disseminating materials,&#13;
evaluating materials, revising materials as necessary, and (when necessary)&#13;
training health workers in the use of materials for counseling);&#13;
(c)    Management of IEC activities (including IEC strategy development and&#13;
management at national, state, district, health facility and community levels)&#13;
(d)   Monitoring, evaluation, and research (including supervision of IEC activities,&#13;
periodic evaluation of IEC activities, and conduct of any additional small research&#13;
projects to gain baseline data in areas for which no data exist, e.g., some rural&#13;
areas); and,&#13;
(e)    Counseling and health education (for patients and their families, health education&#13;
for school children, and eventually health education to the community).&#13;
&#13;

19.    Several issues are key in implementing the strategy. It will be important not to overload&#13;
MOHFW staff, nor to expect them to complete tasks for which they are not adequately prepared.&#13;
Among these issues are: (a) Training in IEC management is advisable so that MOHFW staff can&#13;
tap resources in the private sector and NGO community for specialized IEC tasks (e.g.,&#13;
production of creative materials); (b) NGOs may help to provide a cadre of cured TB patient-&#13;
volunteers to assist government efforts in outreach; (c) Decision makers with authority to&#13;
approve IEC materials should be involved in their development from the beginning and should&#13;
be briefed in materials development procedures; they should also be responsible for insuring that&#13;
materials reflect extensive audience participation; and (d) whenever possible, Central Health&#13;
Education Bureau (CHEB) staff should be used to develop materials together with State and/or&#13;
District staff.&#13;

INDIA: Tuberculosis Control Project&#13;
SUPERVISION AND MONITORING ROLE OF THE CENTRAL DIVISION&#13;
1.    Supervision would be carried out through field visits and monitoring would be&#13;
done through reports received from State and District units and from tour reports and&#13;
from periodic appraisal missions from the Central TB Division.&#13;
Supervisory Visits&#13;
2.    Supervisory visits to State TB Cells, State Training and Demonstration Centers&#13;
(STDCs) and other Training Facilities will b carried out on a regular basis. The&#13;
objectives of such supervisory visits would be to:&#13;
(a)   assess progress in implementation/preparation;&#13;
(b)   identify technical and administrative bottlenecks; and&#13;
(c)   assist in problem solving and provide support.&#13;
3.    These supervisory visits would be planned for all the officers and consultants of&#13;
the Central TB Division. On a regular basis, the consultants will visit the State Cells,&#13;
STDCs, other training facilities, and the districts under implementation of the RNTP and&#13;
the districts in preparation for the RNTP. The Central TB Division officers would give&#13;
priority to poorly performing districts in scheduling their visit for discussion with State&#13;
governments.&#13;
4.    The supervisory strength of the Central TB Division would be augmented by&#13;
requisitioning the services of officers of the other Central Institutions. The supervisory&#13;
skills of these officers would be developed through the familiarization with field&#13;
problems in the districts and the needs of training institutions. This familiarization would&#13;
be done by linking them to the initial visits of Central TB Division officers.&#13;
Monitoring&#13;
5.    Monitoring would comprise 7 areas, namely:&#13;
(a)   Monitoring the Progress of Implementation Plan. This would be done by&#13;
the concerned officer responsible for the particular activity. The progress&#13;
report would be made to the director of the TB Control program and&#13;
would be discussed in the monthly meeting of the Central Division&#13;
officers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 184-&#13;
Annex 20&#13;
(b)   Monitoring of Logistics and Qualitv Control. This would be done on the&#13;
basis of information received from the procuring agency, supplier, MSO&#13;
(Medical Stores Organization), Monthly Report of GMSDs (Government&#13;
Medical Store Depots), Quarterly Report from the States/Districts.&#13;
(c)   Monitoring of Program Indicators. The program indicators would be&#13;
monitored quarterly on the basis of the quarterly reports on program&#13;
performance. The information would be shared with other Central&#13;
Division officers and suitable feedback would be sent to the implementing&#13;
States/Districts.&#13;
(d)   Monitoring of Expenditure and Budget Utilization. This would be done&#13;
monthly on the basis of the monthly expenditure report and information&#13;
collected from the field by the visiting Central TB Division officers. This&#13;
would be discussed during the monthly meeting on program&#13;
implementation.&#13;
(e)   Monitoring Progress in Training and Strengthening of Training&#13;
Institutions. This would be done on the basis of Quarterly Reports on&#13;
Training received at the Central Division and of compiled reports from&#13;
Central Institutions on progress in development of State Training and&#13;
Demonstration Centers (STDCs) and other training institutions.&#13;
(f)    Monitoring Progress in Filling Up of Additional Posts. This would refer&#13;
to (i) the progress in recruitment of additional staff; (ii) filling up a&#13;
proportion of such posts by deployment of regular staff from other time&#13;
bound programs; and (iii) creation of additional posts. The monitoring&#13;
would be done on the basis of progress reports of state implementation and&#13;
on the basis of information gathered during supervisory visits by Central&#13;
TB Division officers.&#13;
(g)   Monitoring Cost Reimbursement. Progress in reimbursement of costs&#13;
accrued in the program activities from the World Bank project would be&#13;
reviewed every quarter for appropriate action.&#13;
(h)   Monitoring of Patient Satisfaction. This refers to patients satisfaction with&#13;
the timing and availability of services, treatment by service providers,&#13;
economic costs involved, and availability of medicines.&#13;
Feedback to the Implementing Units&#13;
6.    Feedback indicating action points as a result of supervisory visits and monitoring&#13;
would be forwarded to the concerned implementing units.&#13;

Annex 21&#13;
INDIA: Tuberculosis Control Project&#13;
IDA SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The supervision strategy for this project would be based on: (a) the technical&#13;
inputs provided by the WHO TB Advisor posted in India; (b) the progress reports&#13;
submitted by the MOHFW; and (c) targeted program review missions by IDA or by&#13;
WHO on behalf of IDA; and (d) a mid-term review. WHO will be the agency which will&#13;
provide technical assistance and guidance to both the Government of India and IDA with&#13;
regard to TB Control in India.&#13;
Project Review Missions&#13;
2.    Regular Project Review Missions. IDA's project review mission would be based&#13;
on progress reports submitted by the Central Division at MOHFW and information&#13;
provided by the WHO TB technical advisor stationed in India and the Bank staff in NDO.&#13;
A Bank project review mission would visit the project regularly every six months. The&#13;
mission would be led by a Bank task manager or a WHO representative and would&#13;
include multi-disciplinary teams with experience in Tuberculosis control. On each&#13;
supervision mission there would be a joint meeting of states and central officials involved&#13;
in implementation, either in Delhi or in one of the state capitals to review generic issues&#13;
associated with the project. The meeting would serve the purpose of disseminating and&#13;
sharing experience among states. In addition, the mission would visit project sites in&#13;
selected districts or cities on a rotating basis.&#13;
3.    If the project is launched in April, 1997, the first supervision mission would be&#13;
scheduled between October and November 1997. Then for the following years, it would&#13;
be scheduled around April-May and around October-November.&#13;
4.    Composition of Missions. Missions would include, as appropriate, specialists in&#13;
tuberculosis, epidemiology, general management, drug-logistics, IEC, MIS, operational&#13;
research, procurement, disbursement, training and social issues. These specialists may&#13;
visit the states in teams or individually by prior arrangement between the task manager&#13;
and the project authorities (MOHFW). In addition, specialists in other areas may&#13;
occasionally be included in missions as needed.&#13;
5.    Six-month Progress Report. The report would include a summary of project&#13;
activities in the past 6 months, problems encountered in the field, project budget and&#13;
expenditures, reviews of project components and progress on the performance indicators.&#13;
The report will also include a plan of activities to be implemented in the next six months.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 186 -&#13;
Annex 21&#13;
6.    Additional Missions. In addition to routine supervision, the task manager or&#13;
individual specialist (e.g. from WHO) may visit Delhi or specific states for trouble-&#13;
shooting or emergencies.&#13;
Mid-term Review.&#13;
7.    The objective of the project mid-term review is to determine if the original project&#13;
design needs re-thinking or if mid-course corrections need to be made. It also may be&#13;
used for a preliminary evaluation of the project impact, if the project has progressed&#13;
sufficiently to expect any significant impact. At this time, and based on the progress&#13;
achieved, a preliminary plan for possible preparation of a follow up project to finance the&#13;
expansion of RNTP beyond the 102 districts would be discussed. The review would be&#13;
conducted jointly by MOHFW and Family Welfare and IDA mission and would be based&#13;
on the findings of the international panel of experts review, which will precede the mid-&#13;
term review.&#13;
8.    The review would consist of assessing project progress as measured against the&#13;
original activities and time schedule set out in the Implementation Plan. To do this,&#13;
project documents and MIS would be used. Notes on the status of fulfillment of project&#13;
agreements and covenants would also be included. Special studies may be carried out to&#13;
assess specific issues such as case relapse or drug resistance as part of the operations&#13;
research component. The results of the social assessments would be reviewed to evaluate&#13;
changes in the behavior of the providers and the patients toward tuberculosis.&#13;
9.    A final mid-term review report will be submitted to IDA and discussed with the&#13;
government in the following supervision mission. It should highlight any major issues or&#13;
delays in the project execution, and prospects for resolving them and completing the&#13;
project on time.&#13;
Role of the Resident Mission&#13;
10.   The human resources group of the New Delhi mission has been strengthened to&#13;
carry out an increasing share of the supervision work for human resources projects in&#13;
India. This group would play an important role in this project. The supervisory activities&#13;
delegated to the field office would be carried out by the local PHN official under the&#13;
advice of the Task Manager or of the Sr. Public Health Advisor. Procurement issues&#13;
would be handled by the Delhi Office Procurement and Accounting Group as well as&#13;
issues related to accounting, auditing and disbursement under the overall responsibility of&#13;
the Task Manager.&#13;

1.        The project has been developed with the active involvement of stakeholders who&#13;
play a critical role in bringing about the paradigm shift required to deal with the TB problem as a&#13;
public health threat. Unlike other development projects, the proposed project did not require the&#13;
active participation of beneficiaries in project design, but it did call for the active involvement of&#13;
the health providers in the public and private sectors, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and NGOs.&#13;
It also required an understanding of the barriers faced by TB patients in obtaining quality care,&#13;
their perception of disease and its cure.&#13;
2.        To achieve these objective, the preparation process included: First, the participation&#13;
of pharmaceutical manufacturers in a Symposium organized by the International Federation of&#13;
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA). The symposium focused on the benefits,&#13;
possible problems and international availability of products designed to provide fixed dose&#13;
combinations of drugs in the dosage recommended for Multi-Drug Therapy of tuberculosis. The&#13;
purpose of the symposium was to begin raising the awareness of manufacturers regarding the&#13;
critical needs faced by countries like India for TB control with a public health approach, and to&#13;
familiarize program officers with the international situation and experiences regarding TB&#13;
pharmaceuticals. The conclusions of the symposium served as a guide to develop the&#13;
specifications for drugs including decision on appropriate drug packaging&#13;
3.        Second, project preparation involved the implementation of pilot projects in fifteen&#13;
sites with the purpose of involving service providers in the development of the proposed project&#13;
by giving them the opportunity to experience first hand the application of the revised strategy&#13;
and identifying the obstacles they may face in the process. The pilot phase was launched through&#13;
a workshop where the action plans for implementation of phase II in the pilot sites were&#13;
discussed and finalized. The plans also included steps to begin involving the private sector and&#13;
the NGOs in the implementation of the project.&#13;
4.        Third, two Social Assessments, one in urban slums and one in tribal areas, were&#13;
carried out to uncover the issues facing TB patients and the relationship between patients and&#13;
service providers. A summary of the assessment is given in Annex 16.&#13;
5.        Fourth, several workshops and meetings were held with representatives from the&#13;
Indian Medical Association (IMA) and over 25 NGOs involved in TB. The interest and support&#13;
expressed by both groups were extremely encouraging. During the workshops, initial&#13;
agreements were reached on the strategy that would be used to involve NGOs and private&#13;
physicians through the IMA in the fight against TB. In addition, several NGOs participated in&#13;
the pilot projects; however, despite numerous efforts by the government authorities, the response&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 190-&#13;
Annex 22&#13;
of the private physicians in the districts has been slow. Also, despite continuous dialogue with&#13;
numerous NGOs, there is still one large NGO who has voiced its objection to the Project.&#13;
6.        Fifth, the outreach and communication strategy of the project calls for a systematic&#13;
involvement in the community to help reduce the stigma associated with TB, and support the&#13;
DOT approach to treatment. The social indicators listed in Annex 9 were the result of the&#13;
involvement of patients, NGOs, and service providers.&#13;
7.        In sum, the participatory approach used in this project offers an unorthodox but&#13;
illustrative example of the variety of modalities that can be used in a participatory process, based&#13;
on the context and objectives of the project and the type of stakeholders involved.&#13;

INVOLVEMENT OF NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS&#13;
IN THE REVISED STRATEGY OF NTP (RNTP)&#13;
Preamble&#13;
1.    For proper implementation of the Revised Strategy of the National Tuberculosis&#13;
Control Program (RNTP), a concerted effort through a process of an inter-sectoral&#13;
collaboration between Government and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) would&#13;
be implemented. A number of NGOs are actively involved in Tuberculosis Control at the&#13;
national, state and district levels, therefore, involvement of NGOs can greatly enhance&#13;
the implementation of the RNTP. NGO involvement in the RNTP may not only be&#13;
limited to treatment of Tuberculosis but to any related activity that an NGO is involved&#13;
with. This may include diagnosis and microscopy; training; health education or service&#13;
delivery, including referral systems, in urban slums, rural areas, tribal populations and&#13;
remote areas; drug supply and distribution (e.g., pharmaceutical stores and dispensaries);&#13;
Operations Research or any other practical and meaningful NGO work applicable within&#13;
the RNTP and the TB Control program.&#13;
Strategy&#13;
2.   The strategy to be used would be that of close collaboration with NGOs in&#13;
implementing the RNTP. Structures in the RNTP at the national (National Tuberculosis&#13;
Control Board), the state (Tuberculosis Coordinating Committee) and the district levels&#13;
(District Tuberculosis Control Societies) would provide the vehicle for such&#13;
collaboration between government and NGO in Tuberculosis Control.&#13;
Operational Component&#13;
3.   The proposed activities to ensure the participation of NGOs as partners in the&#13;
RNTP would include:&#13;
(a)   Inviting representatives of umbrella NGOs to serve as members of the&#13;
coordination committees at the different levels;&#13;
(b)   Providing interested NGOs with information and literature on the RNTP&#13;
on a regular basis;&#13;
(c)   Involving NGOs in the planning, implementation and evaluation of the TB&#13;
control program through the National Tuberculosis Control Board, the&#13;
State Tuberculosis Coordinating Committee and the District Tuberculosis&#13;
Control Societies;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 192-&#13;
Annex 23&#13;
(d)   Inviting NGOs to visit pilot sites to get a better understanding of the&#13;
RNTP and share their knowledge of working with TB patients;&#13;
(e)   Inviting NGOs working at various levels (national, state, district) to&#13;
furnish details of their activities and their areas of coverage to the Central&#13;
government as soon as possible to compile a National Directory. In doing&#13;
so, NGOs would also specifically define their functions relating to TB&#13;
Control and clarify the particular area of the RNTP in which they can&#13;
participate, e.g., DOT, health education (IEC), patient registration,&#13;
training, diagnosis, treatment, drug supply, etc. NGOs would likewise&#13;
identify the particular population for the activities they undertake. From&#13;
such a National Directory would come: (i) a classification and listing of&#13;
NGOs region wise; (ii) identification of previous experience and role of&#13;
the NGOs in the community especially in relation to community health&#13;
services; and (iii) determining the field of expertise and interest of the&#13;
particular NGO;&#13;
(f)   Inviting NGOs to participate in RNTP training. Training in the RNTP&#13;
would be offered free to NGO staff. Adequate resources to undertake the&#13;
RNTP would be provided to NGOs who have decided to adopt the RNTP&#13;
strategy;&#13;
(g)   Inviting the NGOs to develop a methodology for coordinating TB&#13;
activities among themselves;&#13;
(h)   Offering NGOs the opportunity to participate in Operations Research;&#13;
(i)    Assessing the NGOs' interest to be active implementors of the RNTP;&#13;
(j)    Agreeing on methods to ensure consistent recording of TB patients by the&#13;
NGOs as per the RNTP guidelines;&#13;
(k)   Agreeing, in consultation with the concerned NGOs, on geographic areas&#13;
to be covered by the NGOs to avoid duplication of efforts and maximize&#13;
NGO resources for larger and greater impact in the community;&#13;
(1)   Consulting with NGOs working in underserved areas, such as urban&#13;
slums, rural areas, tribal populations and remote areas on how best to&#13;
inform and involve the community in relation to RNTP;&#13;
(m)   Consulting with NGOs concerning the training of their staff in the RNTP&#13;
and/or seeking the collaboration of NGOs with successful NGO programs&#13;
in TB Control in the training of RNTP staff;&#13;
(n)   Developing health education or IEC materials with qualified NGOs and&#13;
seeking their involvement in disseminating information and involving the&#13;
community;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 193 -&#13;
Annex 23&#13;
(o)   Identifying NGOs interested in taking on program activities such as&#13;
microscopy and DOT in exchange for selected government inputs.&#13;
(p)   Developing a system of recognition to members of the NGO community&#13;
who have contributed to efficient and effective Tuberculosis Control.&#13;
Initial Steps&#13;
4.   To enable the feasibility of NGO active participation and collaboration in the&#13;
RNTP and Tuberculosis Control, a National Directory of NGOs would be compiled at&#13;
the center with the information received from the various umbrella NGOs of different&#13;
areas.&#13;
5.   This directory would be organized in terms of the type of activities the NGOs&#13;
undertake in TB Control.&#13;
6.   These types of activities could include the following headings:&#13;
(a)   Treatment of Tuberculosis;&#13;
(b)   Diagnosis and Microscopy;&#13;
(c)   Training;&#13;
(d)   IEC or Health Education;&#13;
(e)   Service delivery (including referral systems, in urban slums, rural areas,&#13;
tribal populations and remote areas);&#13;
(f)   Drug Supply and Distribution (e.g., pharmaceutical stores and&#13;
dispensaries);&#13;
(g)   MIS;&#13;
(h)   Operations Research; and&#13;
(i)    Other practical and meaningful NGO work applicable within the RNTP&#13;
and the TB Control program.&#13;
7.   Likewise, it has been agreed that the NGOs would develop a methodology for&#13;
coordination amongst themselves and demarcating the area of operation and functions&#13;
e.g. in case finding, DOT training, Health Education, operations research, etc., as&#13;
suggested during consultation and planning workshops conducted with NGOs.&#13;
8.   Develop annual plan of action on activities related to NGO involvement in&#13;
consultation with the NGOs. The coordination of these activities would be managed by&#13;
an official of the Central TB Division designated for this purpose, under the direction of&#13;
the project manager and in coordination with the State TB officers, as needed. The State&#13;
TB Officer would perform a similar task at the State level.&#13;

INDIA: Tuberculosis Control Project&#13;
LOGISTIC SUPPORT - DRUGS, EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES&#13;
Drugs in RNTCP Districts&#13;
1 .    Drug Requirement. The drug requirement will be calculated as per estimated number of&#13;
patients seeking treatment from a Government health facility. Taking an average Annual Risk of&#13;
Infection (ARI) of 1.7, the smear positive cases are estimated at 85/100,000 population (Styblo&#13;
Model). Assuming that 60% of TB cases would avail facilities from the Government health system,&#13;
it is estimated that 50 new smear positive cases per 100,000 population will register with RNTP. On&#13;
the basis of Pilot Phase I &amp; II, it is observed that the re-treatment cases will be about 50% of the new&#13;
smear positive i.e. 25/100,000 population. With quality sputum examination for diagnosis, the&#13;
proportion of new-smear negative cases is expected to be equal to new smear- positives i.e.&#13;
50/100,000 population. The extra pulmonary cases are assumed to be 20% of the new smear&#13;
positive i.e. 10/100,000 population. Based on these assumptions, it is expected that a total of 135 TB&#13;
cases/100,000 population will be diagnosed and treated under the program and accordingly the drug&#13;
requirement for the project has been calculated.&#13;
2.    Packaging.   The drug will be procured in blister combipacks both for intensive and&#13;
continuation phase of treatment in different schedule, viz. Schedule I -EHRZ, Schedule II - RH,&#13;
Schedule III - EHR and Schedule IV - HRZ.&#13;
3.    Procurement Method.  Procurement of drugs for the project would be primarily a centrally-&#13;
managed activity performed by the MOH. Purchases would be through the use of World Bank&#13;
Standard Bidding Documents and Internationally Competitive Bidding procedures (ICB) to supply&#13;
multi-drug packs in blister pack containers. Technical and commercial specifications for this type of&#13;
purchase have already been successfully tested during the Phase II Pilot.&#13;
4.    Storage &amp; Distribution. 50% of the drugs procured would be delivered from the&#13;
manufacturers directly to different Government Medical Store Depots (GMSD) situated at Karnal,&#13;
Bombay, Madras, Hyderabad, Calcutta and Guwahati. All the MSDs have facilities for storage of&#13;
the drugs. Regular flow of supplies from GMSDs to different project areas will be maintained&#13;
thereby preventing accumulation of huge quantities of drugs in the GMSDs. The remaining 50% of&#13;
the drugs procured will be delivered directly to the districts by the manufacturers.&#13;
5.    The GMSDs will dispatch the drugs directly to the project district every six months as per&#13;
the release order issued by the Central TB Division. The already existing mechanism of Rail/Road&#13;
transport will be utilized to undertake this delivery. The drug storage facility already available at&#13;
DTCs is being improved to meet the requirement. Supply of drug beyond the district will be done by&#13;
the DTO/Project Officer or Senior TB Supervisor on a quarterly basis during their supervisory visit.&#13;
Drug stock would be replenished every six months at the DTC, quarterly at the TU and monthly at&#13;
CHC/PHC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 196-&#13;
Annex 24&#13;
Drugs in NTCP Districts&#13;
6.    Drug Requirement. The requirement has been estimated on the last three years average of the&#13;
cases reported in the National TB Control Program. One hundred percent supply of drugs for the&#13;
sputum-positive patients will be made by the Centre whereas conventional drugs required for&#13;
treating sputum-negative and extra pulmonary cases will be procured by the State Health Authority&#13;
from the State budget.&#13;
7.    Packaging. SCC drugs will be procured in Blister Combipack (EHRZ) for intensive Phase of&#13;
treatment and in blister strips (Ethambutol &amp; INH) for continuation phase of treatment for six&#13;
months.&#13;
8.    Storage and Distribution. The MOH directs the manufacturers to supply the drugs directly to&#13;
a Regional Government Medical Store Depot (GMSD) in different parts of the country as per the&#13;
distribution schedule communicated by the Central TB Division. These GMSDs have adequate&#13;
facilities for storage of the drugs. Systems exist by which these GMSDs can dispatch the drugs&#13;
either by Rail/Road transport to the District TB Centres.&#13;
9.    The District Tuberculosis Centre (DTCs) will submit their annual indents to the State&#13;
program Officer with a copy of the indent sent directly to the Central TB Division of the DGHS.&#13;
These indents will be base on the actual number of patients diagnosed, treated, drug utilization&#13;
during previous year and current balance in stock.&#13;
10.   The State ProgramOfficer will scrutinize the indents of all DTCs, compile it and send the&#13;
compiled report along with the indents in one lot to TB Division DGHS within a month of receiving&#13;
them.&#13;
11.   The TB Division DGHS will scrutinize the demand on the basis of number of case expected&#13;
diagnosed and on consumption of drugs during the last year. Based on these calculations, release&#13;
order will be issued to GMSDs for each of the DTCs, with intimation to State authorities.&#13;
12.   GMSD will dispatch the drug within one month from the date of receipt order from TB&#13;
Division, DGHS. It is being considered that the supply of drugs from the GMSDs to the districts&#13;
will be done twice a year; the first supply based on the previous years reporting and the second based&#13;
on consumption of the first supply.&#13;
Quality Control for Drug Purchases&#13;
13.   Quality Control. There is an in-built mechanism of quality control in purchase procedures.&#13;
The Inspector of drug from GMSD will visit the warehouse of manufacturers and collect three&#13;
random samples of each drug each batch&#13;
14.   One set of samples will be sent to the drug laboratory for quality testing, the second sample&#13;
will be handed over to a manufacturer and the third sample will be retained by GMSD. Once the&#13;
quality of the drug is checked and recommendation for acceptance is received, the matter is&#13;
conveyed to the manufacturer, after which the manufacturer will dispatch the stores to different&#13;
GMSDs as per agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 197-&#13;
Annex 24&#13;
15.   Distribution of drugs beyond DTCs is the responsibility of the DTO who ensures that PHIs&#13;
maintains a drug stock of three months. The DTO has been provided with a vehicle under the&#13;
program for supervision and supply of logistics.&#13;
Combination Drugs and Bio-availability Testing&#13;
16.   In the treatment of pulmonary Tuberculosis with Short-Course Chemotherapy, combination&#13;
drugs would be very useful in different situations as they prevent selective drug treatment&#13;
(monotherapy) ensure greater precision of dose, avoid errors in drug ratios, improve drug handling&#13;
and delivery, and prevent shortage of supplies of individual drug components. Moreover,&#13;
combination drugs reduce the risk of creating drug resistance in self-administered treatment. Hence,&#13;
the combination of rifampicin with other drugs has a high priority because of the risk of losing this&#13;
most effective anti-TB drugs, if used inappropriately.&#13;
17.   However, the combination of rifampicin with other anti-TB drugs is known to give rise to&#13;
problems of bio-availability for not only rifampicin but even other drugs in the combination. They&#13;
may indirectly lead to sub-dosing of drugs in the treatment regimen and can cause failure or drug&#13;
resistance. Accordingly, steps need to be taken for ensuring the quality and bio-availability of the&#13;
combined anit-TB drug preparations. These will include:&#13;
(a)    The data from human bio-availability studies should be an essential pre-requisite for&#13;
registration of combination drugs in multi-drug treatment regimens. This data should&#13;
show that the drugs in combination are bio-equivalent to simple component products&#13;
administered together.&#13;
(b)    Establishment of testing laboratories which can independently conduct a bio-&#13;
availability test on behalf of the Government of India.&#13;
(c)    The testing laboratories should conform to the agreed international standards for bio-&#13;
availability of the drugs, standard test methodology and to the acceptable&#13;
international limits.&#13;
18    Efforts will be made to establish these mechanisms at the earliest. Only once these have&#13;
been established, combination drugs will find a place in the National Tuberculosis Control Program.&#13;
Equipment, Supplies and Vehicles&#13;
19.   Laboratory equipment. Over 90% of the costs for laboratory equipment involves the&#13;
purchase of binocular microscopes, with the remainder for centrifuge devices, refrigerators, or&#13;
similar small scale laboratory appliances. Bulk purchases of the microscopes and other laboratory&#13;
equipment would be procured by the Centre in contracts valued over US$200,000 using ICB&#13;
procedures. Contracts valued at US$200,000 or less would be procured through NCB procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA. For small purchases not exceeding US$10,000, procurement would be through&#13;
rate contracts or local shopping procedures at the Centre, state or district level, comparing price&#13;
quotations from at least three suppliers to ensure competitive prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 198 -&#13;
Annex 24&#13;
20.   Other equipment. Procurement of other equipment would be phased on an annual basis over&#13;
the first four years of the project in accordance with the requirements of the project activities as&#13;
additional districts meet eligibility criteria and initiate new activities. Over 60% of the costs for&#13;
laboratory equipment involves the purchase of small computers and peripherals, with the remainder&#13;
for audio visual equipment, photocopiers, FAX machines and other office equipment. Purchases of&#13;
this equipment would be bulked whenever possible and purchased at the State level. Contracts&#13;
valued at US$200,000 or less would be procured through NCB procedures acceptable to IDA, and&#13;
for small purchases not exceeding US$10,000, procurement would be through rate contracts or local&#13;
shopping procedures at the State or District level, comparing price quotations from at least three&#13;
suppliers to ensure competitive prices up to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$3.0 million.&#13;
21.   Vehicles. Procurement of vehicles would be phased on an annual basis over the entire five&#13;
years of the project in accordance with the requirements of the project activities as additional&#13;
districts are brought into the RNTP. Over 50% of the costs for vehicles would be for the purchase of&#13;
jeeps to be used at the State and District Headquarters, and the bulk of the remaining costs for some&#13;
537 two wheeler vehicles for transportation at the sub-District levels. Because the project involves&#13;
ten or more states spaced over a five year period, and the total requirement for jeeps is roughly 237&#13;
vehicles, no contract is expected to contain more than 10 vehicles. Such a purchasing plan does not&#13;
lend itself to ICB. Wherever possible, requirements would be bulked at the state level and purchased&#13;
through NCB procedures. For purchases not exceeding US$200,000, procurement would be through&#13;
DGS&amp;D rate contracts or local shopping procedures, comparing price quotations from at least three&#13;
suppliers to ensure competitive prices.&#13;
22.   Laboratory supplies. Procurement of laboratory supplies would be phased on a quarterly or&#13;
semi-annual basis throughout the life of the project in accordance with the requirements of the&#13;
project activities. The supplies required include such items as glass microscope slides, slide storage&#13;
cases, reagents, and sputum cups. Purchases of laboratory supplies would be bulked whenever&#13;
possible and procured at the State level in contracts valued at US$200,000 or less through NCB&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA for an aggregate amount not exceeding US$2.4 million. However, it&#13;
is recognized that bulking of such items even at the state level may not always be a practical solution&#13;
for the small quantities that may be involved and the distribution problems that may result.&#13;
Therefore, for small purchases not exceeding US$10,000, procurement would be through DGS&amp;D&#13;
rate contracts or local shopping procedures at the state or district level, comparing price quotations&#13;
from at least three suppliers to ensure competitive prices.&#13;

            The Tuberculosis Control Project
            introduces a revised strategy for Tuberculosis control
            having the goal of reducing mortality, morbidity, and
            disability. The project's specific objectives will be
            to effectively treat about 1.9 million TB cases; achieve a
            85 percent cure rate in the revised strategy districts;
            provide treatment with daily short-course chemotherapy and
            conventional drugs; and improve diagnosis, patient
            registration, and monitoring of treatment completion and
            cure. To meet the stated objectives, the project will
            finance activities and inputs under three main components:
            (1) improving the quality, access, and outcomes of TB
            treatment; (2) developing institutional and operational
            research capacity and enhancing technical, managerial, and
            interpersonal skills; and (3) developing information,
            communication, and outreach activities, and promoting
            community involvement. Overall, the project will initiate a
            shift in the epidemiological profile of tuberculosis in
            India by focusing on the cure of infectious patients.
