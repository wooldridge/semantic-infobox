        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Over the past decade most developing
            economies have involved the private sector in providing
            infrastructure services. Indeed, between 1990 and 2002, 136
            low- and middle-income countries introduced private
            participation in infrastructure sectors-65 of them in at
            least three sectors. During that period the private sector
            took over the operating or construction risk, or both, for
            more than 2,600 astructure projects in developing countries,
            attracting investment commitments of more than US$800
            billion. These projects have been implemented under schemes
            ranging from management contracts to concessions to
            divestitures to greenfield build-operate-transfer or
            build-operate-own projects. Annual investment flows to
            infrastructure projects with private participation grew
            strongly between 1990 and 1997, from US$18 billion to more
            than US$127 billion. Since then investment flows have
            gradually declined, except for a temporary recovery in 2000.
