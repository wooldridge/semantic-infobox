&amp;#12;The World Bank has been involved in an ongoing            improve the quantity, quality and delivery of clean&#13;
effort to strengthen the case for mainstreaming           water. Meanwhile, water enterprises have begun to&#13;

documents an experiment designed to show that             provision.     Amongst other things, many have&#13;
increasing attention to women could improve the           introduced schemes to ease the initial cost of the&#13;
success of the project. It was carried out between        water connection, for example by introducing&#13;
March and December 1997 in Palu, Central Sulawesi.        payment by installments over a number of years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
For over 20 years, the World Bank has been providing&#13;
loans to support public water supply enterprises in&#13;
Indonesia, originally through specific water supply&#13;
projects and later through components of integrated&#13;
urban development projects. The loans have been&#13;
used to facilitate the provision of clean water to&#13;
rapidly growing urban populations.&#13;
&#13;
                                                          Despite the heavy investments that have been made, an&#13;
During preparation of the projects, projections of the    estimated 35% of 33.6 million urban dwellers still do not&#13;
expected demand for household connections were            have access to a piped water supply. 1&#13;
made, to determine long-term financial viability of the&#13;
water supply enterprises. However, the number             Until now, the customer as viewed by the water&#13;
of new connections actually made each year is             enterprises, has been the household unit. No specific&#13;
consistently below the forecasted number.                 attention has been paid to the role of women in&#13;
Without the income from new connections, and with         particular, as potential customers of water supply&#13;
reduced regular income from monthly fees, the water       services, even though they are almost always&#13;
enterprises are no longer financially viable and need     responsible for managing the family's domestic water&#13;
to be subsidized.                                         requirements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In some cases, the reasons for failing to meet            It is also likely that:&#13;
the targets for new connections are physical              ·   the lack of any demand from women within a family&#13;
or technical. For example, new industries or irrigation       has considerable influence on the decision not to&#13;
may have reduced the supply of available water, or            apply for a water connection. This is more likely in&#13;
the decreasing water quality may have overstretched           areas where there is an easily accessible supply of&#13;
the capacity of water treatment plants.                       water from an alternative source&#13;
                                                          ·   the sources available, usually shallow or deep wells,&#13;
In other cases, people are simply not choosing                are often below standard and contribute to&#13;
to apply for household connections. One reason                environmental damage through depletion of&#13;
is the perceived high cost of connections and the             groundwater resources&#13;
poor quality of service provided. To address these&#13;
problems, investments through loans have aimed to         Location of trial&#13;
&#13;
1 World Bank Social Indicators of Development, 1996       Palu provided a suitable location for testing the&#13;
&amp;#12;hypothesis, as only about 40% of the target number&#13;
of household connections are actually made each&#13;
year, despite the fact that the water enterprise&#13;
(PDAM) offers a continuous and adequate supply of&#13;
clean water. PDAM's present installed capacity of&#13;
127 liters/secod is sufficient to serve 15,240&#13;
customers, but they have only 6000 customers - far&#13;
below their target and service capacity.        This is&#13;
severely affecting the financial viability of the&#13;
enterprise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Reasons why potential customers are choosing not&#13;
to connect:&#13;
·   high cost of connection fee&#13;
·   access to alternative sources of water (though&#13;
    these are not always safe and their uncontrolled&#13;
    use leads to depletion of the ground water&#13;
    resources)&#13;
·   lack of promotion of PDAM products and services,&#13;
    and&#13;
·   poor public image of the water utility.&#13;

At the start of the experiment, a brief household&#13;
survey was carried out in both areas to investigate&#13;

                                                           Due to the low turnout of participants at the&#13;
The survey also aimed to explore what community&#13;

marketing strategy was then developed with PDAM,           activities would be carried out door-to-door.&#13;
&#13;
and applied in the two areas.&#13;
                                                           Marketing assistants were recruited and trained to&#13;

The main component of the marketing strategy was           was given to households with ready-to-be-&#13;
to sell family health and economic value of PDAM           operationalized facilities. These consisted of pipe&#13;
piped water to the target communities in both              networks pre-installed in the yards of the houses by&#13;
areas. PDAM staff was involved throughout all of           PDAM (during the implementation of the Donggala-&#13;

The main result of this experiment was that in the&#13;
year before marketing, the average number of new         It should be noted that these results are indicative;&#13;
connections per month were 1.08 in Besusu Tengah,        the sample size is small, and the number of connections&#13;
and 1.16 in Tatura.      In the four months after        is relatively small. To reach the target number of&#13;
marketing, the average number of connectios made         connections for 1997 as projected in the World Bank&#13;
per moth rose to 7.5 in Besusu Tengah (where             Staff Appraisal Report for the Sulawesi Urban&#13;
marketing focused only on women), and 1.25 in            Development Project, 9000 new connections need&#13;

increase in the number of connections in the&#13;
area where marketing focused on women was&#13;
substantially higher than the increase in the&#13;
other location. Further to this, when the addresses&#13;
of the applications were compared with the addresses&#13;
of the houses visited during the marketing, almost all&#13;
of those applying for connections in Besusu Tengah&#13;
had been visited during the marketing activity. In&#13;

                                                         would result in about 3000 new connections, and&#13;
                                                         would cost Rp 92,000,000. Clearly then, door-to-door&#13;
                                                         marketing alone is not sufficient to bring the number&#13;
                                                         of connectios up to a level where PDAM becomes&#13;

            This note briefly documents and
            experiment designed to show increasing attention to women
            could improve the success of the project. For over 20 years,
            the World Bank has been providing loans to support public
            water supply enterprises in Indonesia, originally through
            specific water supply projects and later through components
            of integrated urban development projects. The loans have
            been used to facilitate the provision of clean water to
            rapidly growing urban populations. During preparation of the
            projects, projections of the expected demand for household
            connections were made, to determine long-term financial
            viability of the water supply enterprises. However, the
            number of new connections actually made each year is
            consistently forecasted number. Without the income from new
            connections, and with reduced regular income from monthly
            fees, the water enterprises are no longer financially viable
            and need to be subsidized. In other cases, people are simply
            not choosing to apply for household connections. One reason
            is the perceived high cost of connections and the poor
            quality of service provided. To address these problems,
            investments through loans have aimed to improve the
            quantity, quality and delivery of clean water.
