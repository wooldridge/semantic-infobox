                             Release of the Third Tranche - Full Compliance&#13;
&#13;
                                                 I. BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
1        This memorandum summarizes progress made under the Third Structural Adjustment&#13;
&amp;edit (SAC III), Credit No. 3582.MLI, for the Republic of Mali and recommends releaseof&#13;
the third tranche of the credit. The SAC III, in the amount of SDR 55 million (US$70 million&#13;
equivalent), was approved by the Board of Directors on December 11, 2001. The credit aims&#13;
to provide balance of payments support to the Government to close the financing gap&#13;
stemming from the recent crisis in the cotton sector, enabling the Government to maintain&#13;
momentum on its ongoing reform agenda, notably the following priority reform areas: (i)&#13;
public expenditure reforms aimed specifically at advancing the Government's poverty&#13;
reduction objectives; and (ii) recovery and restructuring of the cotton sector to restore positive&#13;
economic growth. By focusing on reforms to improve public expenditure management and&#13;
liberalize the cotton sector, the SAC III targets.the programs most critical to Mali's poverty&#13;
reduction objectives.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The SAC III is a three tranche operation, and conditions for each tranche release are&#13;
specified in Schedule 2 of the Development Credit Agreement as amended in December&#13;
2002. The first tranche of SDR 19.6 million (US$25 million equivalent) was released on&#13;
January 3, 2002 upon credit effectiveness, and the second tranche of SDR 15.7 million&#13;
(US$20 million equivalent) was released on December 24, 2002 following Board approval&#13;
to an amendment of the DCA. - The third tranche is for an amount of SDR 19.6 million&#13;
(US$25 million equivalent).&#13;
&#13;
3        Since effectiveness, the implementation of the reform program as specified in the&#13;
Letter of Development Policy for the SAC III, has been satisfactory. The progress made on&#13;
macroeconomic management and on the reform program is noteworthy in view of (i) the&#13;
difficult    international       context     of    heavily     subsidized         cotton    production        (a recent&#13;
studyestimates Mali's         foregone export earnings in 2001 at US$42 million),                          and (ii) the&#13;
negative impact of the Cote d'Ivoire crisis on the Malian economy.2&#13;
&#13;
4.       Significant      progress has been made on the overall program, and the specific&#13;
conditions for third tranche release have been met. This memorandum presents the actions&#13;
taken by the Government to meet the conditions under the SAC III. It recommends that the&#13;
Association release the third tranche, providing timely assistance to the Government in&#13;

and Central Africa).&#13;
&#13;
2The crisishaveresulted in: (i) the closure of the main transport link for 70 to 80 percentof Mali's externaltrade; (ii) the&#13;
collapseof livestockexports(Mali's third most important export which wassold mainly to C&amp;e d'Ivoire), amounting to a&#13;
lossof US$12 million equivalent in 2002; (iii) diversion of tradeto other ports in neighboring countries, resulting in an&#13;
increasein transportation costs(the cost premium for cotton exports isestimatedat 40 percent); (iv) acollapsein workers&#13;
remittancesfrom C&amp;e d'Ivoire; and (v) the return of over 10,000Malians to Mali with many more thousandsexpectedin&#13;

macroeconomic stability and growth.&#13;
&#13;
                                  II. RECENTECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
5        Mali reached the Completion Point of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in March 2003,&#13;
in parallel with the approval of its PRSP. These milestones were reached following a&#13;
decade-long period of growth and good macroeconomic performance. Despite a number of&#13;
adverse shocks, real GDP growth has averaged about 5 percent per annum between 19940&#13;
2002, enabling real per capita GDP to rise by 2.5 percent per year. The Malian authorities&#13;
have been successful at limiting inflation to single-digit figures and reining in the fiscal&#13;
deficit in line with the convergence obligations under the West African Economic and&#13;
Monetary Union (WAEMU)                  regional integration agreement. Mali also made good progress&#13;
on revenue generation (Table l), with revenues reaching more than 17% of GDP (well above&#13;
the Sub-Saharan Africa average).&#13;
&#13;
6        Mali's macroeconomic performance can be attributed to reestablishment of political&#13;
and social stability in the early 1990~,~and to the effective implementation of&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization and economic liberalization policies since the 1994 devaluation&#13;
of the CFA franc, both of which createdthe foundations of a market-led economy and&#13;
encouraged private sector development.4 Recent economic developments have been&#13;
influenced, however, by weak performance of the country's cotton sector. The sector, which&#13;
achieved impressive growth and significant gains in the world export market share following&#13;
the 1994 devaluation, experienced a severe financial and structural crisis in 2000 in the wake&#13;
of the falling international cotton price. Coverage of the sector's losses by transfers from the&#13;
budget to the cotton parastatal company (CompagnieMaliennepour leDe'veloppementdes&#13;
Textiles- CMDT), which have beenexacerbatedby the Cote d'Ivoire crisis, risked derailing&#13;
Mali's otherwise satisfactory fiscal and economic performance over a decade-long process&#13;
of economic and structural reforms. The emergence of gold as Mali's leading export product&#13;
since 1999 fortunately helped mitigate some of the negative impact of the cotton sector and&#13;
Cote d'Ivoire crises.&#13;

            Sources:  Malian  authorities  and siaffestimates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7         Mali's economic performance remains fragile in view of the economy's vulnerability&#13;
to climatic conditions, fluctuating terms of trade, dependenceon ports in neighboring&#13;
countries, the concentration of its exports in three primary sector products5,and weak&#13;
administrative capabilities. The favorable averagereal growth experienced since the 1994&#13;
devaluation masks significant annual volatility.                     Economic growth fell to 3.5 percent in 2001&#13;
owing to the cotton sector crisis and difficulties in food crop production, but rebounded in&#13;
2002 to an estimated 9.7 percent due to the sharp increase in gold, cotton and cereal&#13;
production. GDP growth is estimated to be -1.1 percent in 2003, and is projected to rebound&#13;
above 5 percent in 2004 barring additional exogenousshocks.&#13;
&#13;
8         Mali's macroeconomic performance has generally been within the Government's&#13;
targets, and it has managed to attract both multilateral and bilateral funds aimed at deepening&#13;
structural reforms and enhancing its socio-economic situation. The sixth and final review of&#13;
Mali's PRGF concluded in July. 2003 that Mali continued to make good progress in&#13;
implementing their Fund-supported program, under difficult conditions. All performance&#13;
criteria and indicative targets were met. In view of the negative exogenous shocks in 2002-&#13;
03, the authorities would need to adjust expenditures downward (except for priority sectors)&#13;
in line with a shortfall in revenues, in order to achieve program and fiscal objectives. The&#13;
authorities are committed to pursuing prudent macroeconomic policies over the medium&#13;
term and to implementing needed structural reforms, in order to remain on track with the&#13;
poverty reduction strategy. The Bank and other donors are providing the necessary support&#13;
to the Mali authorities to ensure successful implementation of Mali's poverty reduction&#13;
strategy.&#13;

                            III.      PROGRESS AGAINST             TRANCHE      RELEASE CRITERIA&#13;
&#13;
9         The General Requirements for Tranche Releases, as spelled out in Schedule 2, Part&#13;
A, of the Development Credit Agreement, are:&#13;
&#13;
      a) the Association is satisfied with the progress achieved by the Borrower in the&#13;
          carrying out of the reform program.&#13;
&#13;
      b) the macroeconomic policy framework of the Borrower is satisfactory, as measured on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5 Gold  and cotton together    comprise     over 80 percent of export earnings,   while livestock - exported  primarily to West&#13;
Africa regional  markets - accounts for about 8 percent of export earnings.       Cotton has historically  been the number one&#13;
export earner ahead of gold, although      gold has only recently surpassed cotton export revenues and today accounts for about&#13;
55 percent of export receipts.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
          the basis of indicators agreedbetween the Borrower and the Association.&#13;
&#13;
10.       With    respect to the first requirement, the authorities are on track with                                  the&#13;
implementation of the reform program. The status of implementation of the reform program is&#13;
as follows:&#13;
&#13;
For thepublicexpendituremanagementcomponent:&#13;
&#13;
     l    With the 2003 Budget, the authorities have introduced a three-year medium term&#13;
          expenditure framework               compatible      with      the macroeconomic            framework        that&#13;
          integrates not only health and education sector expenditures defined under the&#13;
          respective ten-year development plans as required under the SAC III LDP, but also&#13;
          expenditures of all other ministries and government agencies;&#13;
&#13;
     l    The functional and technical study to define the specifications for integrating the&#13;
          computer systems of the treasury, budget, and financial control departments has been&#13;
          completed, and the next action (development and testing of the integrated system)&#13;
          commenced in January 2003 as per sc.liedule to ensure implementation of the new&#13;
          system during the first quarter of 2004;&#13;
&#13;
     l    The procedures manual for budget execution has been prepared and deemed&#13;
          satisfactory by the Bank. The manual will be validated and disseminated, following&#13;
          its review by the new committee on procedures in the Prime Minister's office;&#13;
&#13;
     l    Strengthening of internal and financial                  audit functions is evident in the steady&#13;
          increase in budget allocation to the concerned units between 2001 and 2003, as well&#13;
          as an increase in the number of inspection staff. Continued provision of additional&#13;
          resourcesis already envisioned in the 2004 budget currently under preparation;6&#13;
&#13;
          Strengthening the capabilities of the General Accounts Office (i.e., the Sectionde&#13;
          Compteof the Supreme Court) is evident in the recruitment of additional personnel&#13;
          to increase staff numbers to legally mandated levels;                           the completion of a new&#13;
          building with sufficient space to house all personnel; ongoing renovations of the old&#13;
          building to house the archives and documents center; and the temporary loan of&#13;
          additional staff from the internal audit department to assist in clearing the backlog of&#13;
          work, notably the review of the Government's .budget execution reports (the Loisde&#13;
          rkglement)for 1996-l 999.7 Additional                   resources were provided to the Accounts&#13;
          Office early in calendar 2003, to support its work program.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6 It should benoted that, in addition to strengtheningthe audit functions, the authorities would needto ensureadequate&#13;
follow up of the audit reportsproduced by theseunits.&#13;
&#13;
7 The Sectionde Compte is reviewing the 1996-99 budget execution reports. Final technicaldiscussionshavebeenheld&#13;
with the Treasuryto clarify certain budget lines. Following a final review, the Section would beable to prepare its budget&#13;
audit reportsfor submissionto the parliament.&#13;

            by governmentto neverthelesspursuethe biddingprocess.The datefor submitting&#13;
            the financial bid is now set to September30, 2003, following a requestfrom the&#13;
            remainingbidder to postponethe deadline. In view of the transparencyof the&#13;
            processthat hasbeenfollowed so far, andthe fact that only onebidderremainsin&#13;
            competitiondespitegovernment'sbestefforts, the conditionof bringingHuicomato&#13;

8As defined in theDevelopment Credit Agreement(DCA), "bring to the point of sale" requiresthe Borrower to have&#13;
taken the following steps: (i) prepared anddistributed investment memorandafor the relevant statecompanies;&#13;
(ii) solicited offers directly or through advertisement(s)in appropriate newspapers,under terms andconditions agreedupon&#13;
betweenthe Borrower and the Association; (iii) evaluatedthe offers and selectedthe bidder(s) (if any); and(iv) invited the&#13;
successfulbidder(s)(if any) to enter into good faith negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
9 Perthe ProcurementGuidelines (paragraph2.59), "bidding documentsusually provide that Borrowers may reject all bids.&#13;
Rejectionof all bids isjustified when there is lack of effective competition, or bids are not substantiallyresponsive. Lack&#13;
of competition shall not bedetermined solely on thebasisof the number of bidders. If all bids arerejected,the Borrower&#13;
shallreview the causesjustifying the rejection andconsidermaking revisionsto the conditions of contract, designand&#13;
specifications,scopeof the contract, or acombination of these,before inviting new bids."&#13;

               Dunavantto Mali in earlyMay to discussapossibleimprovementof theirbid. Shortly&#13;
               followingthesediscussions,Dunavantindicatedtheir inabilityto maintainor improve&#13;
               their financialbid and withdrew from the process. On June 12, the government&#13;
               declaredthebiddingprocessunsuccessful.In view of theabove,thetransparencyof the&#13;
               process,andthe bestefforts of governmentto bring theseassetsto the point of sale&#13;
               despitethe unfavorableeconomicenvironment(essentiallythepoliticalcrisisin Cote&#13;
               d'Ivoire),theconditionhasbeenfulfilled.**&#13;

            Mali - Third Structural Adjustment Credit
            Project : release of the third tranche - full compliance
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Third Structural Adjustment Credit
            (SACIII) Project aims to provide balance of payments support
            to the Government, to close the financing gap stemming from
            the recent crisis in the cotton sector, enabling the
            Government to maintain momentum on its ongoing reform
            agenda, notably the following priority reform areas: a)
            public expenditure reforms aimed specifically at advancing
            the Government's poverty reduction objectives; and, b)
            recovery and restructuring of the cotton sector to restore
            positive economic growth. Satisfactory progress of the
            reform program, and of the macroeconomic policy framework
            grant the release of the third tranche, conditional to the
            privatization of two cotton sector companies - Office de la
            Haute Vallee du Niger, and Huilerie Cotonniere du Mali -
            and, on progress in preparing the medium term expenditure
            frameworks, particularly for the education, and health
            sectors. All conditions for the release of the Third Tranche
            have been met, being the execution of the program broadly
            satisfactory, thus the tranche amount is now available for disbursement.
