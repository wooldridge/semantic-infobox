            Infrastructure projects - a review of
            canceled private projects
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In recent years the renegotiation and,
            even more, the cancellation of private infrastructure
            projects in developing countries have made the headlines in
            the world's financial press. For a variety of reasons
            the renegotiation of projects is not an unusual occurrence.
            But as this Note explains, only 48 private infrastructure
            projects in developing countries were canceled in 1990-2001,
            a small fraction of the nearly 2,500 projects that reached
            financial closure over this period. The note further
            explains the definition of cancellation, the reasons for
            cancellation, and expands on the implications for private
            provision of infrastructure.
