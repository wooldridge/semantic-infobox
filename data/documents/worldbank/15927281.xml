&#13;
Increasing employment among youth and increasing the earnings and job-stability of youth is important&#13;
for Pakistan. This study examines the labor market outcomes of graduates from training institutes run by&#13;
Punjab TEVTA, the largest technical and vocational education and training provider in the province of&#13;
Punjab, Pakistan. The study uses an SMS-based survey of 7,840 graduates from 2010. This is a promising&#13;
and inexpensive method to assess the impact of education and training in developing countries. Using&#13;
SMS is feasible, fast, and very low-cost, but it comes with a set of challenges, notably a low response&#13;
rate. We summarize lessons for future SMS-administered surveys. For the labor market outcomes, we&#13;
find that only 39 percent of graduates are employed post training with considerable variation in&#13;
employment outcomes across trades, districts, gender, and schools. We conclude that there is overall&#13;
strong need for the improvement of quality and relevance of technical education and vocational training,&#13;
and that some schools, trades, and districts are substantially better at linking to labor market demand than&#13;
others.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                         I.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.       One of the key indicators for measuring performance of the Technical and Vocational&#13;
Education and Training (TVET) sector is the labor market outcomes of its graduates. As part of the&#13;
Pakistan Education Sector Review that focuses on technical education and vocational training, this survey&#13;
establishes background and labor market information for a sample of trainees who graduated from public&#13;
training institutions run by the Punjab Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (P-&#13;
TEVTA) in 2010.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The Government of Punjab awards high priority to the development of its TVET sector. It&#13;
boasts 456 technical education and vocational training public institutions in the province. However, these&#13;
institutions face a number of important challenges, notably relevance of training is reportedly low,&#13;
training opportunities for youth are few, investments are far in-between, infrastructure is increasingly&#13;
becoming outdated and accountability for results could be increased. The Province has taken several steps&#13;
to address some of these, the most significant being re-organization of the sector by providing autonomy&#13;
to the Punjab Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (P-TEVTA) and giving it&#13;
administrative authority over all TVET related public activity in the province.&#13;
&#13;
3.      This study sets a baseline for labor market outcomes of the graduates, and is informed by&#13;
an SMS-based survey of graduates. The introduction of an incentive in the form of mobile phone credit&#13;
was also tested to investigate whether it increased survey response and completion rates.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The survey was administered to 7,840 graduates in 3 phases: Phase 1 marks the pilot phase; in&#13;
Phase 2 the survey was rolled out after design adjustments informed by Phase 1 and; Phase 3 was&#13;
conducted at the end to investigate the effect of an incentive in the form of mobile phone credit on the&#13;
survey response rate.&#13;
&#13;
5.       The overall response rate of the survey was 16 percent. This introduces a possibility that the&#13;
survey suffers from significant biases, and one should therefore be cautious in drawing conclusions from&#13;
the study. Further, the study allowed us to draw a number of lessons for future mobile phone tracer&#13;
studies.&#13;
&#13;
6.       The findings of the survey indicate a strong need for the improvement of quality and&#13;
relevance of technical education and vocational training. Excluding the group of graduates in further&#13;
studies, the employment percentage is 39 percent while 61 percent remain without job, almost all of&#13;
which were looking for employment. 28 percent of the respondents were engaged in further education. As&#13;
expected employment outcomes differ across trades, districts, gender, and schools. Among other things,&#13;
this variation indicates that training is substantially better linked to labor market demand in some schools,&#13;
trades, and districts. Details on the findings are presented in the rest of this paper.&#13;
&#13;
7.      This paper is organized as follows. After this introduction follows a section on methodology,&#13;
including data collection method (mobile phone), the questionnaire, and the sample. The third section&#13;
describes the results, while the fourth concludes and draw lessons for future tracer studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     1&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           II.     METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             Rationale for using SMS to conduct baseline survey&#13;
&#13;
8.       Paper-based surveys are typically expensive and require a substantial duration of time to train the&#13;
surveyors, conduct the survey, and enter the data obtained. The fact that the vocational training and&#13;
technical education trainees are literate/educated (see Table 2) presented us with an opportunity to&#13;
administer the survey via SMS without having to conduct a more traditional survey where the respondents&#13;
were interviewed, necessary had they been illiterate. Developing a simple platform to conduct the survey&#13;
was not expensive or did not take long, and graduates could be contacted directly. Given low SMS costs,&#13;
the cost of designing a platform to administer the survey was minimal and required only the services of a&#13;
consultant.1&#13;
&#13;
9.      As shown in a Punjab household survey from 2007-08, the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, the&#13;
mobile phone penetration rate in Punjab is quite high: 71 percent of households own mobile phones, and&#13;
almost 29 percent of households belonging to the lowest wealth quintile own a mobile phone. Since then,&#13;
mobile phone penetration is expected to have further increased.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
    The combined cost of the consultantâ&#128;&#159;s services and the SMS costs is Rs. 77,000, or approximately USD$865.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10.     Despite the advantages of using SMS to conduct the baseline survey, the use of SMS poses&#13;
several limitations. First, the sample of graduates with mobile phones may not be representative of the&#13;
population of TVET graduates â&#128;&#147; as a matter of fact, the sample may consist of graduates from relatively&#13;
higher income quintiles. This introduces a bias in the results. Second, the response rate is expected to be&#13;
much lower than that of a paper-based/interview-based survey given that the response is dependent&#13;
wholly on the graduateâ&#128;&#159;s willingness to respond and cannot be elicited or encouraged by the physical&#13;
presence of an interviewer. Also, the graduates were not informed of the survey and thus did not expect it,&#13;
potentially further reducing the response rate. Third, the use of SMS necessarily limits the number of&#13;
questions in the survey, given that there are costs, however minimal, to the graduate to reply. There is also&#13;
a limit on the number of characters which can be sent in each SMS, thus placing constraints on the&#13;
language used, as well as the number of forced-response choices which can be sent with each question.&#13;
Fourth, a dataset with updated mobile phone numbers must be accessible. Last, the order of the questions&#13;
must be structured, so as to ensure that the most important information is obtained first in the event that&#13;
the respondent does not complete the survey. This may not be possible with all surveys.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         3&#13;
&amp;#12;                                               The Sample&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11.      At the time of sample identification, the Management Information System cell at P-TEVTA was&#13;
in the process of collating data on trainees who graduated in 2010 from its training institutions. P-TEVTA&#13;
had data available for 13,171 graduates. The data was downloaded in May 2011, so the population&#13;
consists of graduates whose data was already present in the database on that day. The focus of the tracer&#13;
study was on graduates from technical and vocational education and training at the diploma (post-&#13;
secondary level) and the certificate level (vocational and technical secondary education). Bachelor-level&#13;
students, for example in commerce were excluded in order to measure outcomes for non-tertiary technical&#13;
and vocational education and training.&#13;
&#13;
12.      The survey design uses SMS to administer the survey to the graduates, so the larger sample was&#13;
further filtered to include only those graduates with valid mobile numbers. This reduced the number of&#13;
graduates by about 40 percent to 7,840. Table 12, Table 13, and Table 14 in Annex 1 show the change in&#13;
the sample structure with respect to trade representation, location, and gender. The proportion of&#13;
graduates across the 36 districts sees little variation except for the district of Rahim Yar Khan where the&#13;
proportion of graduates is halved, and Sahiwal, which sees its representation increase by almost 50&#13;
percent.&#13;
&#13;
13.      Representation across trades doesn't change by more than 2.5 percent (positively or negatively)&#13;
from the data set to the sample with valid phone numbers. However, some trades are not represented in&#13;
the sample (those are marked in italic in Annex 1, Table 12), but only a very small percentage of&#13;
graduates are enrolled in these courses in the population. Overall the sample appears to be representative&#13;
of the spectrum of programs in the province. The ten most popular courses by enrolment accounted for 57&#13;
percent of all enrolment, with the Diploma in Commerce accounting for over 20 percent of enrolment,&#13;
followed by the Certificate in Computer Applications (9 percent), and the Mechanical DAE course&#13;
(almost 6 percent). The sample may be under-representative of females. Information on gender was&#13;
available for approximately 72 percent of graduates in the dataset of graduates, of which 32 percent were&#13;
female graduates. Missing information on gender was filled in based on the name of the graduate. The&#13;
share of female graduates in the sample with valid phone numbers is about 23 percent. It would therefore&#13;
seem that female graduates are underrepresented in the sample. However, given the missing gender data&#13;
in the sample, it is difficult to make any definitive statements with regards to female overrepresentation or&#13;
underrepresentation in the sample. The following table illustrates basic descriptive statistics for the&#13;
sample.&#13;

14.     Information on previous education was limited â&#128;&#147; only available for 2,350 graduates. As seen in&#13;
the sample with information on previous education, most students would have completed either middle&#13;
school (8 years of schooling) or Matric (10 years of schooling) in order to qualify for technical and&#13;
vocational education and training.&#13;
&#13;
                                            Questionnaire&#13;
&#13;
15.     The survey questions sent to the graduates can be seen in Annexes 3A, 3B and 3C. The questions&#13;
are sent in roman Urdu. As can be seen, though there are minor variations in the surveys, the following&#13;
information is collected:&#13;
&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Current employment status&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Numbers of hours worked per week&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Income earned last month&#13;
   ï&#130;·   Whether training was useful to current employment&#13;
&#13;
16.    The information received was appended to the database of graduate information downloaded&#13;
from the P-TEVTA MIS database. The database already contained information such as the graduate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   5&#13;
&amp;#12;name, gender, mobile phone number, address, name of institution and course attended, duration of the&#13;
course, district, marks obtained, and education level attained before training.&#13;
&#13;
                                                Platform used&#13;
&#13;
17.     Four SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) cards were used to send messages to trainees using a&#13;
modem connected to a computer, which sends and receives messages through an SMS Gateway. This was&#13;
developed using SMSLib which is a JAVA library for sending/receiving SMS. The Core Application&#13;
sends out the surveys, parses the incoming messages and generates the responses. This was developed as&#13;
a simple state machine in PHP using a PHP framework called Yii. Both parts of the application&#13;
communicate to each other using a MySQL database, which is where the data received is stored.&#13;
&#13;
                                                    Process&#13;
&#13;
18.     The sample of graduates with valid mobile numbers was split into 3 groups: Phase 1, Phase 2 and&#13;
Phase 3.&#13;
&#13;
19.      Phase 1 marks the pilot of the survey, in which the survey was administered to 600 randomly&#13;
selected graduates from the sample over the course of 4 days. The survey questions sent can be seen in&#13;
Annex 3A. The 600 graduates were split into 3 further groups: Group 1 to receive no incentive, Group 2&#13;
to receive Rs. 10 (US$ 0.11) upon completion of the survey, and Group 3 to receive Rs. 30 (US$ 0.34)&#13;
upon the completion of the survey. The incentive was not offered until the respondent had confirmed&#13;
his/her identity and the name of the training institute; hence the effect of the incentive can only be seen on&#13;
the survey completion rate and not the response rate.&#13;
&#13;
20.      The pilot revealed certain areas of the survey which required improvement or change. Details are&#13;
provided in the â&#128;&#156;Lessons Learnedâ&#128;? section of this working paper. Design adjustments were made to&#13;
shorten the number of questions in the survey by combining questions where possible; the order of the&#13;
questions was rearranged so that the critical questions were asked earlier during the survey; and the&#13;
incentive was revoked because of the difficulty in transferring the credit to those who completed the&#13;
survey. Also, given the lack of â&#128;&#156;credibilityâ&#128;? of the survey illustrated by the numerous messages asking for&#13;
further identification, it was decided that instead of sending the survey on behalf of the traineeâ&#128;&#159;s&#13;
institution, it would be sent out on behalf of Punjab TEVTA.&#13;
&#13;
21.     In Phase 2, the survey (see Annex 3B) was sent to 6,840 graduates over a 12-day period2,&#13;
incorporating the changes described above. No incentive was offered to any of the graduates from Phase&#13;
2.&#13;
&#13;
22.     Phase 3 was used as to test the effect of offering an incentive (credit) at the beginning of the&#13;
survey. Two subgroups of 200 randomly chosen graduates each were sent Rs. 10 and Rs. 30 separately.&#13;
The survey from Phase 2 was used, adjusted only to provide the incentive and collect information&#13;
necessary to send the credit (see Annex 3C).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
  The rate at which the survey was sent was slowed down because some respondents tried calling the number back,&#13;
slowing the program down.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
23.      The table below shows survey response and completion rates. The response rate is the proportion&#13;
of graduates from the sample who answer at least one question. The completion rate is the number of&#13;
surveys completed by respondents as a proportion of the number of surveys which receive at least one&#13;
response. As evident from the table, the adjustments to the phase 1 questionnaire seemingly succeeded in&#13;
raising the share of respondents who completed the survey.&#13;

24.     The rest of the section lists the key findings of the survey. Detailed results are presented in Annex&#13;

Phase 1 survey differed slightly from Phases 2 and 3.&#13;

&amp;#12;25.      The current employment status of the respondents to the related question is presented in the table&#13;
above for all three phases. If the respondents in further education and training are excluded, which is&#13;
standard for calculation of employment rates, the employment percent is estimated to 39%.3 More than 93&#13;
percent of the unemployed respondents were looking for a job.4 It is likely that with time, the share of&#13;
graduates with a job increases as graduates gain practical experience and become more successful in&#13;
contacting employers. Although there is no information on how long the graduates have been in the labor&#13;
market except for the year of graduation, the unemployment percentage clearly indicates that youths face&#13;
problems transitioning from TVET school to a job. This could be for several reasons: (i) low relevance&#13;
and/or quality of education, including a lack of practical skills; (ii) little job-search assistance on how to&#13;
find a job; (iii) reduced connections to employers and no assistance was provided in this regard, and (iv)&#13;
stagnant economy with few employers hire. These are reasons that are likely to vary substantial across the&#13;
trades, gender, schools, districts, and prior education. We explore this further in the next paragraphs.&#13;
&#13;
26.     The following table shows the corresponding employment rates for the top 10 trades which&#13;
account for over 57 percent of graduate responses.5 The table excludes trades for which the number of&#13;
responses was 15 or less.&#13;
&#13;
Table 15 in Annex 2 shows that there is no statistically significant difference in the average employment&#13;
rate amongst the top 5 trades; however, when the top 10 trades are considered, the employment rate for&#13;
those with training in the Draftsman Civil (G-III) trade is statistically significantly lower than the&#13;
employment rates of those in Electrical (DAE) and Civil (DAE) at the 5 percent level, and those in&#13;
Diploma in Commerce and Certificate in Computer Applications at the 10 percent level. The employment&#13;
rate for those graduates with a Diploma in Vocational Girls is lower than that of those graduates with&#13;
training in Electrical (DAE), significant at the 10 percent level.6 The bottom line is that employment&#13;
varies substantially between trades. Our main interpretation is that some trades are more relevant to the&#13;
labor market needs of the province and/or of higher quality, while others are unfortunately unrelated to&#13;
demand and/or of low quality, and graduates consequently face unemployment upon graduation.7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;

  95 percent confidence interval: 35.7%-43.1%.&#13;
4&#13;
  Please note that although 406 respondents are listed as unemployed, only 376 reply to the following question&#13;
asking whether or not they are seeking employment.&#13;
5&#13;
  Does not include further training/studying responses.&#13;
6&#13;
  Pair-wise t-tests were conducted for the top 10 trades, under the assumption that variances are unequal within each&#13;
pair, given that the size of each group differs.&#13;
7&#13;
  Two supplementary interpretations are that the employment percentage increases with (a) the required level of&#13;
education, for example DAE courses (diploma) require at least matric, which is not required by certificate level&#13;
courses; and (b) the length of the courses. We explore this below.&#13;
&#13;
                                                          8&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27.      The male employment rate is over 12 percentage points higher than the female employment rate&#13;
(41% versus 29% â&#128;&#147; see Table 16: T-test of Employment Rate, by Gender , Annex 2). The difference is&#13;
statistically significant at the 5 percent level. A number of factors could explain this substantial gender&#13;
difference. First, gender specific factors are likely to be associated with job-search efforts and mobility.&#13;
Second, there are likely to be systematic gender differences in educational factors affecting employment,&#13;
notably trades. Most females graduate from courses in dress-making, beautician courses, glass-painting,&#13;
home-economics, office automation/secretarial services, etc. These courses may have lower labor market&#13;
relevance than traditionally male-oriented trades.&#13;
&#13;
28.      Employment rates for the top 5 districts are shown in Table 6. These districts account for almost&#13;
one-fifth of graduate responses. The table excludes districts for which the number of responses is less&#13;
than 15. Pair-wise t-tests amongst the top 5 districts reveal no statistically significant differences in the&#13;
employment rate at the 1, 5 or 10 percent levels, except between Lodhran and Sahiwal, which is&#13;
statistically significant at the 10 percent level. Figure 1 shows the employment rate by district for those&#13;
districts with a minimum of 10 observations.&#13;

29.     The employment rates differ substantially across the types of TVET institutions. There are&#13;
graduates from 6 types of institutions in the survey (there were no responses from graduates from the&#13;
seventh type, Agricultural Machinery Training School). Graduates from the Institutes of Commerce have&#13;
the highest employment percentage (51%), followed by graduates from colleges of commerce (46%) and&#13;
technology (43%), graduates from technical training centres (37%), technical training institutes (33%),&#13;
and graduates from vocational training centres, who have the lowest employment rate (28%). The&#13;
differences seem to signal a higher success in commerce streams than in technical streams, however,&#13;
gender differences are likely to be part of the explanation.&#13;
&#13;
30.     There are several sub-groups of Technical Training Centers, see below. The employment&#13;
outcomes are relatively similar across the different sub-groups, with the exception of the women Centers&#13;
where graduates have a lower employment rate (although it is above the average employment rate for&#13;
female in the total sample.&#13;

&amp;#12;31.      The employment rate seems to be unrelated to the duration of the program. Interestingly, the&#13;
employment rates for those who attended courses lasting 12 months are statistically significantly lower&#13;
than for those who attended courses 3, 6, 24 or 36 months long. While the employment rate for those who&#13;
attended 3 month courses is the highest, it is not statistically significantly higher than those who attended&#13;
longer courses (the exception being 12 month courses).8 9 This is a puzzling finding, which could be&#13;
related to differences in the background of the graduates between those in short versus long duration&#13;
courses. We therefore caution against policymaking solely based upon this finding.&#13;

32.     Caution is warranted when interpreting these results. The representativeness of the sample is&#13;
compromised by potential biases stemming from the fact that not all graduates have a mobile phone and&#13;
only 1 in 6 graduates answered the survey. It could be that the outcomes of those who responded&#13;
systematically differed from the total sample. However, it is not clear whether such biases increase or&#13;
decrease the employment percentage. Further, the sub-categories rely on a low number of responses to the&#13;
survey questions. Also, given the varying duration of different courses, it is difficult to estimate how long&#13;
the graduates were in the labor market before they were surveyed, as no data on graduation dates was&#13;
available. Finally, the names of trade courses are not standardized, and have been kept in their original&#13;
form for the purpose of this study. It is possible that some courses are actually the same but have been&#13;
grouped separately because of differences in spelling or notation.&#13;

                    Effect on Survey Completion and Response Rates of an Incentive to Reply&#13;
&#13;
  36.     In Phase 1, subsequent to the respondent confirming his/her identity and training institute in&#13;
  Messages 1 and 2, an incentive is offered in the form of credit to Group 2 (Rs.10) and Group 3 (Rs.30) 10.&#13;
  The amounts were determined based on an estimate of the cost of responding to the survey. Although&#13;
  subscriptions to SMS â&#128;&#156;bucketsâ&#128;? (bulk purchase of SMSs) are quite popular, the lower incentive was&#13;
  calculated to be the cost of responding to the survey if the respondent had no such subscription. A higher&#13;
  incentive of Rs. 30 was offered to Group 3 to explore the effect of actual benefit to the respondent (a&#13;
  premium above the estimated cost of responding to the survey).&#13;
&#13;
  37.     The table below shows that roughly the same proportion of respondents â&#128;&#158;reachâ&#128;&#159; the incentive&#13;
  message, i.e. they respond to identity confirmation questions in each group. After receiving the message,&#13;
  the survey completion rates increase proportionately with the amount of credit offered.&#13;

       No credit is offered to Group 1.&#13;
&#13;
                                                            13&#13;
&amp;#12;38.      Phase 3 of the baseline survey tests the impact of an incentive offered on the response rate of the&#13;
survey in the first SMS. This is different from Phase 1 where the incentives were only offered after the&#13;
respondent had confirmed her/his identity. The comparison group (no incentive) is the group of graduates&#13;
from Phase 2 as the surveys sent to Phase 2 and Phase 3 graduates are identical with the exception of the&#13;
offer of an incentive in the first message sent to graduates in Phase 3. The credit appears to have no effect&#13;
on raising the response rate of the graduates; in fact, the response rate is lower for the incentive groups&#13;
(though rises proportionately with the amount of credit offered). We have little explanation for this&#13;
finding except that this relatively small incentive seems not to be a motivating factor for responding or&#13;
not in the first place. While the phase 1 incentives seem to show that a small incentive may be effective in&#13;
incentivizing interested graduates to complete the survey.&#13;

                      Lessons Learned for Future Mobile-phone Tracer Studies&#13;
&#13;
39.      Overall, using SMS to administer the baseline survey is feasible and very low-cost, but it comes&#13;
with a set of challenges. This section looks at the lessons learned.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Establishing credibility with regards to the source of the survey is important. Sending the&#13;
        messages from a regular mobile phone number (so-called long code) seemed to lack credibility,&#13;
        judging by the large number of messages which were sent back requesting the identity of the&#13;
        sender. Purchasing an â&#128;&#156;800-number/short codeâ&#128;? would allow the sender to purchase a sending&#13;
        phone number that identifies the sender with a name to all recipients. In Phase 1 of the survey, the&#13;
        introductory message was sent on behalf of the respondentâ&#128;&#159;s institution; however, this did not&#13;
        seem to work and was later adjusted to Punjab TEVTA for Phases 2 and 3. Neither the&#13;
        respondentâ&#128;&#159;s institution name nor Punjab TEVTA (contained in the message) seemed to be&#13;
        effective in establishing credibility at the onset of the survey. Since the respondents are addressed&#13;
        by name, and information of a personal nature (employment status, income) is requested,&#13;
        establishing credibility is key to raising the response and completion rates. This can be done by&#13;
        informing the institutions (who inform their trainees) before the survey so that the respondents&#13;
        expect to be surveyed a certain period after graduation, and understand the objective of the&#13;
        survey.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   The length of the survey must be kept in consideration. The questionnaire used in Phase 1 was&#13;
        shortened and restructured because of the large number of people who â&#128;&#156;dropped outâ&#128;? of the&#13;
        survey.&#13;
&#13;
                                                     14&#13;
&amp;#12;    ï&#130;·   Not all graduates from the sample seemed familiar with responding to a forced-response/multiple-&#13;
        choice question format and responded with actual text. Their answers could not be used in this&#13;
        format. The method of responding to the survey questions via SMS may be explained to trainees&#13;
        when they are informed about the survey by their institution.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   While the offer of credit upon completion of the survey offered later on during the survey&#13;
        increases the completion rate of the survey of those who do respond, it appears to be ineffective&#13;
        in increasing the survey response rate. It should be noted that credit had to be sent to respondents&#13;
        from a kiosk or shop where â&#128;&#156;Easy Loadâ&#128;? facilities were available and could not be sent via the&#13;
        platform. Telecom operators can be contracted to send the credit; however, this can be explored&#13;
        further given the potentially high costs of such contracts, especially when offering a small credit&#13;
        to respondents seemingly has no obvious effects on the initial interest in responding. However, it&#13;
        may be that a larger amount or a lottery with larger prices would be more successful in soliciting&#13;
        a response.&#13;
    ï&#130;·   Using SMS provides an excellent opportunity to inexpensively pilot the survey and make&#13;
        appropriate adjustments to the questions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        IV.     CONCLUSION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
40.     This survey serves to set a baseline for employment, income and other indicators used to&#13;
assess the labor market outcomes of a sample of 2010 technical education and vocational training&#13;
graduates in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. Given the high rate of cell phone penetration in the&#13;
Punjab, the method of survey administration via SMS provides a low-cost, quick and feasible way to&#13;
reach out to a large sample of TVET graduates. The key drawback was a low response rate of only 17&#13;
percent of contacted graduates. The introduction of an incentive in the form of extra mobile credit offered&#13;
to respondents did not improve the respondent rate.&#13;
&#13;
41.      Only 39 percent of graduates are in employment. This employment excludes the graduates&#13;
engaged in further training or studies (28 percent of respondents). More than 93 percent of those&#13;
graduates who listed themselves as unemployed reported that they were seeking employment. Another 28&#13;
percent of graduates pursue further studies. The employment rate is the highest for those with an&#13;
Electrical Diploma of Associate Engineering (DAE) at 51 percent, followed by Civil DAE (50 percent),&#13;
and Welder (43 percent). The employment rate is highest for those graduates from Lodhran district (67&#13;
percent), followed by Bhakkar (54 percent) and Bahawalpur (51 percent). The male employment rate is&#13;
over 12 percentage points higher than the female employment rate (41 percent versus 29 for females).&#13;
&#13;
42.      Over 60 percent of employed respondents worked between 20-40 hours every week.&#13;
Seventy-seven percent of graduates earn less than Rs. 10,000. The mean income reported was&#13;
approximately Rs. 7,600. More than fifty-five percent of graduates reported that their job was in the same&#13;
field as their training.&#13;
&#13;
43.    Caution is advised in over-interpreting the results due to the potential statistical bias&#13;
present in the sampling itself, as well as the low number of responses to the survey questions. To&#13;
conclude, it is important to note the possible limitations of the use of SMS in administering the survey.&#13;
The sample of graduates with mobile phones may not be representative of the population of TVET&#13;
&#13;
                                                    15&#13;
&amp;#12;graduates on the basis of income, introducing a bias in the results. The use of SMS necessarily limits the&#13;
number of questions in the survey, given that there are costs, however minimal, to the graduate to reply. It&#13;
is also important to further explore ways in which the response rate can be increased.&#13;
&#13;
44.     The findings seem to suggest that more needs to be done to improve the employment&#13;
outcomes of trainees and meeting industry demand for skilled labor. A key step for the Government&#13;
and Punjab TEVTA is to increase employability of graduates through improvement in the labor market&#13;
relevance and quality of training, and as a second step continuously measure the employability of&#13;
graduates to see if the improvement raises employability.&#13;

Table 20 shows the employment rate of graduates by previous education level. If only those education&#13;
levels with more than 15 observations are considered, graduates with an FA, FSc, or ICom (Grade 12)&#13;
level of education have the highest employment rate at 45 percent, and those with a Matric the lowest at&#13;
33 percent. Graduates who have completed middle school but not Matric have the same employment rate&#13;
as those with a Matric level of education. Pair-wise t-tests show that the employment rates of graduates&#13;
with Middle, Matric, and FA, FSc, ICom levels of education are not statistically different from each other.&#13;

Table 21 shows the employment rate and average income by district. The top 5 districts by employment&#13;
rate account for 19 percent of graduate responses. Pair-wise t-tests amongst the top 5 districts reveal no&#13;
significant differences in the employment rate at the 1, 5 or 10 percent levels. Graduates from Lodhran&#13;
have the highest employment rate at 67 percent, while only 14 percent of respondents from Attock listed&#13;
themselves as employed11.&#13;

&#13;
Table 22 shows that there is a statistically significant difference between male and female employment&#13;
rates; the employment rate for males is over 12 percent higher than that for females. The number of&#13;
observations for female income is too limited to infer the average income, but the mean income for male&#13;
graduates is Rs. 8,303.&#13;

            Baseline survey : labor market outcomes of
            Punjab TEVTA graduates
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Increasing employment among youth and
            increasing the earnings and job-stability of youth is
            important for Pakistan. This study examines the labor market
            outcomes of graduates from training institutes run by Punjab
            Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority
            (TEVTA), the largest technical and vocational education and
            training provider in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. The
            study uses an SMS-based survey of 7,840 graduates from 2010.
            This is a promising and inexpensive method to assess the
            impact of education and training in developing countries.
            Using SMS is feasible, fast, and very low-cost, but it comes
            with a set of challenges, notably a low response rate. The
            author summarizes lessons for future SMS-administered
            surveys. For the labor market outcomes, we find that only 39
            percent of graduates are employed post training with
            considerable variation in employment outcomes across trades,
            districts, gender, and schools. The author conclude that
            there is overall strong need for the improvement of quality
            and relevance of technical education and vocational
            training, and that some schools, trades, and districts are
            substantially better at linking to labor market demand than others.
