STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
i. BACKGROUND&#13;
A.   COUNTRY CONTEXT&#13;
1.1         Hungary experimented with market type reforms much earlier than the other&#13;
Central and Eastern European countries. The "new economic mechanism" introduced in the late&#13;
1 960s aimed at substituting market prices for the plan as an allocative mechanism. The pace of&#13;
reform was significantly accelerated in the late 1980s, and was strongly supported by both&#13;
Bretton Woods institutions. These efforts were successful in building up some of the basic legal&#13;
and institutional infrastructure of a market economy. A new government came to power through&#13;
free parliamentary elections in the spring of 1991 with a mandate to establish a fully-fledged&#13;
market economy. At the same time, Hungary took a major step toward realizing its vision of full&#13;
integration with Europe by entering into an Association Agreement with the European Union&#13;
(EU) in 1991, and joined the OECD in 1996.&#13;
1.2         The economic transition requires an extensive reorientation in the way Hungary&#13;
develops and uses its human resources. This work has been underway since 1991 using a&#13;
combination of national, bilateral and multilateral resources, including the US$150 million&#13;
Human Resource Project, which closed in June 1997. These efforts have been instrumental in&#13;
helping Hungary cope with emerging unemployment and redeployment of labor to higher&#13;
productivity uses, in retraining adults for the new skills needed as a result of economic&#13;
restructuring, in reorienting the narrow and rigid vocational training for youth in order to develop&#13;
a more mobile and technically adaptable labor force, and in narrowing the technology gap&#13;
between Hungary and Western Europe by reforming and expanding higher education and&#13;
professional training, especially in the fields of management and scientific research and&#13;
development. The central theme of the reforms has been to address the need to redirect human&#13;
resources investments so as to maximize their contribution to economic competitiveness.&#13;
1.3         The proposed Youth Training Project would extend two of the successful&#13;
initiatives supported under the Human Resources Project. Chapter I of this report gives the&#13;
sector background to the proposed Youth Training Project. Chapter II describes the project&#13;
objective, activities; project costs and financing. Implementation arrangements are discussed in&#13;

Chapter III. The benefits and risks of the Project, and the policy agreements reached with the&#13;
Government of Hungary (GOH) are set out in Chapters IV and V, respectively.&#13;
B.   SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
1.4         Youth Unemployment. Starting from a negligible level at the start of the&#13;
transition, unemployment in Hungary developed rapidly in 1991, and reached a maximum of&#13;
13.6 percent in 1993. Although the unemployment rate has subsided slightly since then, it&#13;
remains high: 475,000 people are currently unemployed -- 10.2 percent of the labor force,&#13;
according to registration data. Youth unemployment is a particular concern for the Government.&#13;
As shown in Table 1, below, unemployment rates are highest for workers aged 16 - 19 (38.5&#13;
percent), and decline progressively with age. (Of the current unemployed, 22.5 percent are 25&#13;
years old or less; 50.8 percent are 35 years or less.)&#13;

1.5         The success of new labor force entrants in finding jobs differs markedly by their&#13;
educational experience. Unemployment rates vary inversely with level of education. As shown&#13;
in Table 2, fully seventy-five percent of the unemployed consists of people with the lowest&#13;
educational qualifications: "less-than eight-year primary school", "primary school", and&#13;
"apprenticeship" (primary plus two or three years of vocational training, most of it in&#13;
enterprises). Unemployment rates range from 12 percent to 25 percent for labor-market&#13;
participants with less than a secondary level education. Unemployment rates drop sharply for&#13;
labor-market participants who have a secondary education or more, and are lower for graduates&#13;
of secondary vocational schools than for gimnazium (grammar-school) graduates.&#13;

1.6            The Inherited Education and Training System. Hungary in 1968 had&#13;
abandoned central planning in terms of physical output targets; public enterprises had financial&#13;
performance targets, but were free to pursue them in response to evolving markets for inputs and&#13;
outputs. Thus Hungary entered the transition without the rigid linkage between the&#13;
education/training system and the manpower requirements for meeting planned output targets&#13;
which characterized many of the other transition countries. Even so, Hungary's education system&#13;
at the start of the transition had several features in common with other transition countries. Its&#13;
management was highly centralized. It had achieved a high level of literacy in the population&#13;
and a relatively high level of skill qualification in the labor force. It did so through essentially&#13;
universal coverage at the secondary level -- much of it in the form of vocational, technical, or&#13;
apprenticeship training. Higher education coverage was more limited, and concentrated upon&#13;
science and engineering education.&#13;
1.7            There were a number of serious problems with the inherited education and&#13;
training system. I Secondary level vocational training was provided in too specialized form and&#13;
too early (age 14), before students were mature enough to make a reasoned choice between&#13;
occupations. Specialized vocational education and training provided detailed practical&#13;
instruction for highly specific occupations, but little theoretical instruction in the underlying&#13;
scientific and quantitative principles of the occupation. The graduates of these programs were&#13;
productive only within the confines of these narrow job specializations, and only as long as the&#13;
technology remained unchanged. They were not well equipped to adapt to changes in the&#13;
prevailing technology, or to change occupations in response to the needs of an evolving market&#13;
economy. Moreover, the training relied heavily upon on-site practical experience in enterprises.&#13;
Under the market pressures of the transition, many of these enterprises have closed or lost their&#13;
1 These are described in detail in Hungary: the Transition to a Market Economy -- Critical Human Resource&#13;
Issues (World Bank Report No. 8665-HU; August 1990).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
capacity to provide such training. Finally, the training programs were almost exclusively pre-&#13;
service and concentrated in industrial and agricultural specializations. Very few programs of&#13;
training were available to members of the labor force -- either working or unemployed -- to&#13;
upgrade their skills or to change occupations after leaving the formal education and training&#13;
system. Very few training programs of any kind existed in the service sectors, which have&#13;
experienced the most rapid growth in output and wages since the start of the transition.&#13;
1.8           The economic upheavals which occurred under the transition revealed the&#13;
weaknesses of the education and training system. Apprenticeship and vocational schools are&#13;
having increasing difficulty in finding enterprises willing to provide training places for their&#13;
students, and students who complete vocational and apprenticeship training programs without&#13;
secondary school matriculation are having increasing difficulty in finding jobs. For these&#13;
reasons, enrollment in these programs and the number of schools which offer them have declined&#13;
since the start of the transition (see Figure I and Annex I). Increasingly, non-diploma vocational&#13;
secondary schools are being absorbed or converted into diploma-level secondary technical&#13;
schools. There is growing demand for diploma-level secondary technical education and post-&#13;
secondary specialized programs of technical training in areas like computer skills and foreign&#13;
languages, which are in high demand in the post-transition economy. Enrollments in diploma-&#13;
level secondary courses -- in both academic grammar schools and secondary technical schools --&#13;
have increased since the start of the transition.&#13;

1.9         Education and Training Reforms. Recognizing the limitations of its prior&#13;
programs of vocational education and training, Hungary moved early in the transition to make its&#13;
education system more flexible.2 With support from the World Bank3 and EU PHARE, it&#13;
launched in 1991 an extensive program of reforms -- the most extensive reform of vocational&#13;
education undertaken in any of the transition countries -- designed to make the system more&#13;
flexible, more efficient, and more responsive to student demand and evolving labor market&#13;
needs. The main features of the reform are: a) a major decentralization of responsibility for&#13;
managing education and training, including the involvement of employers and trade unions in the&#13;
management of vocational training, b) extension of general education by two years (grades 9 and&#13;
10) prior to the start of vocational orientation, c) development and delivery of vocational&#13;
orientation in the form of 13 broad job families in place of the well-over-100 separate&#13;
occupational specializations previously offered, d) development of career counseling for students&#13;
to inform them of employment prospects and associated training opportunities in alternative&#13;
occupations, and e) development of post-secondary training, including a network of Regional&#13;
Human Resource Development Centers, to update skills, to upgrade skills, and to support a&#13;
move from one occupation to another. The underlying objective of these reforms is to extend&#13;
and improve general education in basic quantitative, scientific, and problem-solving skills for all&#13;
young people while still providing vocational orientation prior to specialized vocational training&#13;
at the post-secondary level. This is meant to provide a better basis for later work, whether&#13;
students choose to pursue further academic studies, to pursue specialized vocational training, or&#13;
to enter the labor market directly. Under the Government's reform program, compulsory&#13;
education is being extended from eight years to ten years, and the outmoded apprenticeship&#13;
programs are being progressively replaced with secondary vocational orientation programs, along&#13;
with the development of job-specific focused training programs at the post-secondary level.&#13;
Taken together, these changes are developing a more cost-effective education and training&#13;
system which is more adaptable to the skilled manpower needs of an evolving economy, and&#13;
more consistent with education and training systems in the EU and OECD countries.&#13;
1.10        The Human Resources Project is supporting these and a number of related&#13;
reforms. The project has been successfully implemented. One of the key reform activities&#13;
supported under the project was the development of seven new core curricula and 13 new&#13;
consolidated vocational orientation curricula, and the implementation of these programs in 79 of&#13;
the approximately 400 secondary vocational schools in the country. On the basis of the very&#13;
positive reception to these new programs by teachers and students, EU PHARE supported&#13;
implementation of the new curricula in another 79 secondary vocational schools. Another small&#13;
group of schools have joined as "follower schools" without external financial support. The&#13;
proposed Project would support expansion of the number of schools implementing the new core&#13;
curricula and vocational orientation curricula to encompass most secondary vocational schools&#13;
not yet equipped to offer them.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

1.11          Another key activity supported under the Human Resources Project is the&#13;
development of flexible training programs for adolescents and young adults at the post-secondary&#13;
and post-compulsory school level. The project supports the development of flexible, modular&#13;
training programs to meet regional manpower needs. The specializations covered by the&#13;
programs in each locale are jointly agreed by employers, trade unions, and local governments.&#13;
The training programs are being successfully delivered under the project by nine Regional&#13;
Human Resource Development Centers4. Under the proposed Project, this training model would&#13;
be diversified to support, on a competitive basis, training for agreed programs to be provided to&#13;
young adults by public schools, private schools, NGOs5, and the nine Regional Human Resource&#13;
Development Centers. Procedures would be developed to promote development of local&#13;
consortia to ensure that duplication and overlap of programs is minimized and common services&#13;
shared when possible and appropriate. As in the HHRD project, actual training delivery would&#13;
be jointly financed by employers, by local governments, and by the state budget. Decisions&#13;
about specific training to be offered would continue to be made jointly by employers, trade&#13;
unions, and local governments, following criteria and principles agreed with the Bank (Annex&#13;
IV).&#13;
1.12          Financing of Vocational Training. Vocational education and training is&#13;
financed through five main sources: the state budget, local budgets, employers' contributions to a&#13;
national Vocational Training Fund, commissioned training with specific enterprises, and training&#13;
carried out under the Employment Fund. The evolution of financing from these sources is&#13;
presented on page 4 of Annex I. State funds are available to finance the training of youth, who&#13;
are receiving their first vocational qualification, up to the age of 22 (the major focus of the&#13;
proposed Project). State budget financing used to be the main source of financing, but since&#13;
1993 has been eclipsed by local government contributions and commissioned training. In&#13;
addition to these main sources, vocational schools can and do supplement their budgets by&#13;
selling products and services, and renting spare capacity to a variety of users. The state budget&#13;
provides about 50 percent of the total costs of vocational education, which is meant to cover at&#13;
least the full costs of teacher salaries. Under the Local Self-Government Act, counties are&#13;
responsible for administration of secondary education, including vocational and technical&#13;
education. State budget funds for vocational education are transferred to county governments&#13;
primarily on the basis of a normative grant, which stipulates per-student allocations for each type&#13;
of program.6 The state budget transfer is not limited to public schools; it is also paid, under the&#13;
In 1995, the average cost of these modern training programs for the unemployed was approximately US$750&#13;
for programs of about 5 months duration. Job placement rates are in the range of 80% as compared with a&#13;
national average of slightly less than 40%. In comparison, the unemployment benefit was US$100 per month,&#13;
or US$500 for five months in 1995.&#13;
At present, there are some 165 NGOs which offer a range of vocational training in Hungary. (See Annex L.)&#13;
6   The per-student allocation for secondary vocational education was formerly higher than for gimnazium,&#13;
reflecting the higher costs of providing vocational education due to equipment and materials, smaller class&#13;
sizes, etc., and also to encourage large share of vocational education. Per-student allocations have recently&#13;
been changed in order to encourage a shift towards baccalaureate-level programs. In the 1997 draft budget&#13;
law, the per-student allocations were HUF 64,000 for grades I through six of primary school, HUF 68,000 for&#13;
grades 7 and 8 of primary school, HUF 70,000 for grades 9 and Io of gimnazium and technical secondary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
same formula, to private and NGO schools which are registered as schools and follow the&#13;
approved public curriculum. In addition, state budget funds can be paid on a "program" basis to&#13;
institutions which are not registered as traditional "schools", including the nine Regional Human&#13;
Resource Development Centers.&#13;
1.13         All employers -- excluding the army, the civil service, prisons, and the Hungarian&#13;
National Bank -- are required to contribute an amount equal to 1.5 percent of gross wages to a&#13;
National Training Fund. Employers who provide training to their employees or to others, or who&#13;
contribute to training through provision of equipment, staff, or facilities, may be granted a partial&#13;
exemption from paying the training levy. Monies from the Vocational Training Fund are&#13;
distributed to counties on the basis of the number of vocational training students enrolled in each&#13;
county. Decisions on the use of these funds are taken by regional tripartite councils, with&#13;
representatives of employers, workers, and government. The regional tripartite councils decide&#13;
the priorities for training in the region, establish norms for unit costs of each type of training, and&#13;
invite and judge training proposals from private and public training providers.&#13;
C.    RATIONALE AND STRATEGY FOR WORLD BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.14         The rationale for government and Bank involvement in the proposed Project is&#13;
economic. In principle, individuals' decisions about training are subject to the same profitability&#13;
calculus which guides other investment decisions: Individuals should seek training to the extent&#13;
that the benefits of training in the form of enhanced expected earnings exceed the cost of&#13;
training, including foregone income. Firms should provide training for their employees to the&#13;
extent that firm-specific productivity gains exceed the costs of training. In practice, there tends&#13;
to be a suboptimal provision of both types of training because of market failures. Individuals&#13;
tend to purchase too little training because credit is not freely available to finance the training in&#13;
spite of the expected benefits -- a market failure which results from the absence of suitable&#13;
collateral to secure the human capital investment. Employers tend to finance too little training&#13;
because of the fear of losing the trained employee before the training investment is fully&#13;
amortized through increased productivity. This, too, is a market failure, which reflects the&#13;
impracticability of binding employees to work until the full cost of their training is repaid to their&#13;
employers. Like many countries, Hungary deals with these market failures through the&#13;
combination of a training levy (which ensures cost recovery for training in the aggregate) and&#13;
public involvement in -- though not necessarily government provision of-- training.&#13;
1.15         The Bank's assistance strategy in Hungary, as described in the President's Report&#13;
for the recently approved Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan,7 has the broad&#13;
objectives of: a) helping maintain macroeconomic stability and accelerate growth to facilitate&#13;
Hungary's accession to the European Union, b) reforming social policies and strengthening the&#13;
school, HUF 60,000 for all grades of vocational and apprenticeship school, and HUF 87,000 for grades 11&#13;
through 13 of gymnasium and technical secondary school. Allocations under the normative grant for earlier&#13;
years are presented on page 2 of Annex 1.&#13;

human resource base, c) improving environmental management, and d) attracting know-how,&#13;
especially in the infrastructure sectors. Consistent with this general thrust, the investment lending&#13;
proposed in the CAS is intended to respond to particular priorities of the Government, to support&#13;
implementation of agreed policy changes, and to make use of the Bank's experience with what&#13;
works in other countries.8 The proposed Youth Training Project responds to a request from the&#13;
Government to help address the problem of youth unemployment through the expansion of two&#13;
activities developed under the Human Resources Project which are successfully training and&#13;
placing young people in productive jobs. Job placement rates for graduates of the programs are&#13;
in the range of 80-90 percent. Alternative designs were not considered for the proposed Project&#13;
in view of the successful and cost-effective experience with the same activities under the former&#13;
project. However, key lessons learned in the first project have been incorporated in this follow-&#13;
on operation. These lessons include, but are not limited to: the use of contracted procurement&#13;
agents to expedite large equipment purchases, the involvement of employers in the selection of&#13;
training programs to be financed, the development of networks between institutions at the local&#13;
level to increase efficiency of resource use, and the inclusion of ample local financing to ensure&#13;
sufficient local staff development and training.&#13;
The Bank is involved in policy development to help reorient youth and adult training to labor-market needs in&#13;
a number of countries, including FYR Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania, Poland, and Russia. It&#13;
is also supporting the implementation of vocational training reforms in Romania and Russia, as well as under&#13;
the Hungary Human Resources Project.&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.   PROJECT OBJECTIVE&#13;
2.1          The objective of the proposed Project is to help adolescents and young adults&#13;
make the transition from school to work, thus reducing youth unemployment. The expanded use&#13;
of the improved vocational orientation curriculum in secondary schools in place of the former&#13;
excessively narrow secondary level vocational training programs will provide a better basis for&#13;
improved productivity and improved job mobility as the economy continues to evolve. It will&#13;
also reduce recurrent costs, as unit costs for some of the new programs to be extended under the&#13;
Project are about ten percent less than for the former programs. By supporting market-driven&#13;
specialized training for youth and adults, the Project is expected to reduce youth unemployment,&#13;
thereby reducing income support payments and helping young people to make a positive&#13;
contribution to the economy.&#13;
B.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.2          The proposed Project would provide equipment, software, technical assistance&#13;
and training (US$60.1 million equivalent total cost) 9 to continue development and strengthening&#13;
of youth vocational orientation and training programs to address the above objective. The&#13;
Project would be implemented over a three-year period by the Ministry of Labor. It has two&#13;
major components:&#13;
2.3          Component A: Post-Secondary, Job-Oriented Training (US$26.2 million).&#13;
The objective of this component is to strengthen and modernize post-secondary and post-&#13;
compulsory school specialized training programs for young people to facilitate their entry into&#13;
the labor market. These programs of customized training to meet identified local labor-market&#13;
needs are offered to young people who have completed the baccalaureate level or are past&#13;
compulsory school age (after 10th grade or age 16). All training proposals to be financed under&#13;
this component would be submitted to the National Vocational Training Council for review and&#13;
endorsement.&#13;
(a)   Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) (US$0.3 million). This sub-component&#13;
would finance limited technical assistance,10 including limited funds for project&#13;
9  This includes all project costs including Loan financing and local financing, including taxes and contingencies,&#13;
0  Assistance would include limited financing to support country and regional project promotion and&#13;
coordination activities and four months of international training financed by the Loan, plus 12 months of local&#13;
consultants financed by the Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
coordination and promotion, fellowship training, equipment, and software to&#13;
support ongoing operation of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) established&#13;
under the Human Resources Project. The PCU would serve the needs of both&#13;
components of the Project, and would serve as the project "business office" for all&#13;
liaison with the Bank, including procurement and reporting.&#13;
(b)    Curriculum Development (US$5.3 million). This sub-component would&#13;
finance technical assistance1' and limited hardware and software to support&#13;
approximately 15 writing teams which would define occupational skills and&#13;
knowledge, develop modular training curricula, and specify materials and&#13;
equipment necessary to implement the curricula for approximately 85&#13;
occupational specialties. Priority curriculum areas would be identified using&#13;
procedures, principles, and criteria agreed with the Bank. 12 The primary criteria&#13;
would be evidence of labor market demand at the local and national levels as&#13;
ascertained by employer input and evidence of high job placement rates from&#13;
existing programs.&#13;
(c)    Institutional Infrastructure Development (US$18.7 million). This sub-&#13;
component would finance technical assistance,'3 equipment, hardware and&#13;
software to support implementation of new and revised training curricula in&#13;
approximately 170 sites (an average of two sites per curriculum). The institutions&#13;
receiving support would be selected on a competitive basis following procedures,&#13;
principles, and criteria agreed with the Bank (see Annex IV and PIM). Primary&#13;
institutional criteria would include: i) involvement of employers, employees and&#13;
government in managing the institutions and programs, and in selecting the&#13;
training which they provide; ii) evidence that the investment would not duplicate&#13;
existing programs in the region, iii) ability of institutions to operate flexible-entry&#13;
and flexible-exit modular training programs, iv) availability of job counseling and&#13;
placement programs; and v) willingness of the institution to sign performance-&#13;
based training contracts with local labor offices for training the unemployed. The&#13;
competition would be open to public, private, and non-governmental training&#13;
providers -- including, but not limited to, secondary vocational schools, regional&#13;
labor development centers, foundations, and private schools.&#13;
(d)    Staff Development (US$1.9 million). This sub-component would finance staff&#13;
training for key individuals involved in directing and implementing the new&#13;
Assistance would include 85 months of international consultants and 15 months of international training&#13;
financed by the Loan, and 1,020 months of local consultants and 15 months of local training financed by the&#13;
Government.&#13;
12 Key criteria are listed in Annex IV, and detailed procedures are in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM).&#13;
3  Assistance would include 15 months of international consultants financed by the Loan, and 160 month s of&#13;
local consultants financed by the Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- II -&#13;
modular training programs:'4 instructors and managers in training-provider&#13;
institutions, and representatives of local governments, employers' associations,&#13;
and employees' associations. The staff development activities would include both&#13;
international and local training sessions.&#13;
2.4            Component B: Secondary Vocational Orientation (US$33.9 million). This&#13;
component would expand the number of secondary vocational schools  which apply the new&#13;
core curriculum and occupational orientation programs developed under the Hungary Human&#13;
Resource Project.&#13;
(a)    Infrastructure for Core Curricula (US$9.1 million). This sub-component&#13;
would provide hardware, software, and limited technical assistance and staff&#13;
training16 to assist approximately 100 secondary vocational schools to implement&#13;
the seven new academic core curricula for grades 9 through 12 developed under&#13;
the Human Resources Project. Selection of schools would follow principles,&#13;
criteria, and procedures agreed with the Bank (see Annex IV and PIM). Selection&#13;
of schools would be limited to those which did not receive support under the&#13;
Human Resources Project and which have agreed to implement the new&#13;
vocational orientation curricula starting at grade 11 (see following sub-&#13;
component). In addition, approximately 35 schools which were to receive limited&#13;
support under the previous EU PHARE project to implement the new core&#13;
curriculum would be eligible to receive support to implement the new curriculum.&#13;
(b)    Occupational Families Curricula (US$24.8 million). This sub-component&#13;
would provide hardware, software, and limited technical assistance and staff&#13;
training 17 to assist approximately 135 secondary vocational schools to implement&#13;
an average of two vocational orientation curricula each in grades 11 and 12.&#13;
Selection of schools would follow principles, criteria, and procedures agreed with&#13;
the Bank (see Annex IV and the PIM). Selection of schools would be limited to&#13;
those which did not receive support under the Human Resources Project and&#13;
which agree to implement the new core curricula (see previous sub-component).&#13;
Assistance would include 15 months of international consultants and 170 months of international training&#13;
financed by the Loan, and 15 months of local consultants and 150 months of local training financed by the&#13;
Government.&#13;
5  In general, schools that received support under the Human Resources Project and the EU PHARE project&#13;
would not be eligible. However, PHARE schools which were to receive minimal support for core curriculum&#13;
implementation (i.e. grades 9 and 10 only), and no support of the vocational orientation program, would be&#13;
eligible for supplementary project support.&#13;
16  Assistance would include 70 months of international training financed by the Loan, and 70 months of local&#13;
consultants and 945 months of local training financed by the Government.&#13;
17 Assistance would include 270 months of international training financed by the loan, and 168 months of local&#13;
consultants and 270 months of local training financed by the Government.&#13;
&#13;

2.5          During negotiations, agreement was reached that: (a) the Borrower shall ensure&#13;
that training institutions included in, and programs supported under parts Component A (Post&#13;
Secondary, Job-Oriented Training) and Component B (Secondary Vocational Orientation) of the&#13;
Project shall meet the criteria (Annex IV) agreed by the Borrower and the Bank; (b) the&#13;
Borrower shall ensure that all training proposals to be included under Component A (Post&#13;
Secondary Job-oriented Training) of the Project shall be submitted to the Borrower's National&#13;
Vocational Training Council for review and endorsement; and (c) the Adult Labor Market&#13;
Training Department (Munkaeropiaci Kepzesek Foosztaly) of the Borrower's Ministry of Labor&#13;
(MOL) will be responsible of technical implementation of Component A (Post Secondary Job-&#13;
oriented Training) of the Project, and Youth Training Department (Szakoktatasi Foosztaly) of&#13;
MOL will be responsible for technical implementation of Component B (Secondary Vocational&#13;
Orientation). In addition, during negotiations, assurances were given that: (a) approval&#13;
procedures for training under the Post Secondary, Job-Oriented Training component of the&#13;
Project would permit project financing of any training program which is on the national training&#13;
list, but, for programs which are not on the list special procedures are available to put these&#13;
programs on the list if there is clear evidence of labor-market demand; and (b) state budget&#13;
financing for vocational education in schools will be provided through normative grants, and&#13;
program financing grants will be available for other institutions at approximately the same levels;&#13;
for training carried out by private and public secondary vocational schools, NGO schools, and&#13;
Regional Human Resource Development Centers.&#13;
C.    PROJECT COSTS&#13;
2.6          Summary of Project Costs. Total project costs are estimated at US$60.1&#13;
million, including contingencies, local taxes and duties. Total contingencies (physical and price)&#13;
amount to US$3.4 million, representing about 6 percent of total base costs (US$56.6 million).&#13;
Project costs includes consulting services, fellowships and training, furniture, equipment and&#13;
materials and local staff training costs. Base cost estimates were calculated in US dollar&#13;
equivalent, and reflect costs at the time of pre-appraisal in March, 1997. Estimated project costs&#13;
are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 below. Detailed cost figures are provided in the Project&#13;
Implementation Manual.&#13;

2.7            Basis of Cost Estimates. Project costs were estimated on the following basis:&#13;
(a)    Base Costs. All project costs were estimated in US$, given that inflation of the&#13;
Forint is difficult to predict. The average cost of foreign specialist consulting&#13;
services (US$16,000 per month) is based on recent contracts for comparable&#13;
services in other Bank-financed projects in the central and eastern European&#13;
region. This unit cost includes fees, relocation/recruitment costs, housing and&#13;
subsistence, and overheads. The average cost of local consultants has been&#13;
estimated at US$3,000 per month. Overseas fellowships and study visits are&#13;
estimated to cost US$7,000 per staff month, on average. Local training is&#13;
estimated to cost US$2,000 per month. Price estimates for equipment, including&#13;
computers, and furniture are based on current market prices in Hungary and recent&#13;
experience in purchasing similar equipment under the Human Resources Project.&#13;
(b)    Contingency Allowances. Project costs include a six percent contingency&#13;
allowance for unforeseen physical contingencies for all equipment and furniture.&#13;
The total physical contingency of US$0.68 million is equal to about one percent&#13;
of the estimated base cost. The low physical contingencies reflect the absence of&#13;
civil works in the Project. In the absence of credible forecasts of annual local&#13;
price escalation and exchange rates, price increases have been applied to both&#13;
local and foreign costs in US dollar terms at the rate of 3 percent per annum.&#13;
Estimated price contingencies total US$2.7 million.&#13;
(c)    Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component was&#13;
estimated on the basis of the following projected shares of foreign expenditures&#13;
for each category of expenditure: (i) equipment (65 percent), (ii) materials and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
software (65 percent), (iii) expatriate consulting services, fellowships and studies&#13;
(100 percent), and (iv) local staff development, including local consultants, local&#13;
training, local staff salaries (0 percent). The resulting foreign exchange&#13;
component, including contingencies, is estimated at US$36.4 million, or about 60&#13;
percent of total project costs.&#13;
(d)   Taxes. The Project has been costed inclusive of import taxes and duties,&#13;
estimated at 35 percent of all goods. The funds are included as part of the&#13;
Borrower's counterpart contribution, and amount to US$16.4 million.&#13;
2.8         Recurrent costs. No significant incremental recurrent costs are foreseen, as the&#13;
Project primarily supports upgrading or replacement of existing programs rather than expansion&#13;
of existing programs. Indeed, in the case of the Secondary Vocational Orientation Component,&#13;
it is expected that recurrent costs will be reduced by approximately 10 percent due to lower unit&#13;
costs for implementing the new vocational training programs. The significant local staff&#13;
development costs (estimated at US$7.4 million) are included as part of total project costs, to&#13;
help ensure that these amounts are budgeted annually as Borrower counterpart funds.&#13;
D.   PROJECT FINANCING&#13;
2.9         The proposed Loan of US$36.4 million would finance 60 percent of estimated&#13;
total project costs, or 100 percent of the estimated foreign exchange component. The Borrower&#13;
would finance the remaining 40 percent of local costs and all taxes and duties, estimated to total&#13;
US$23.7 million equivalent. The project financing plan is shown in Tables 5 and 6, below:&#13;

3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.   IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
3.1         The Project is scheduled to be implemented by the Ministry of Labor over a three-&#13;
year period. The implementing staff will be integrated, to the degree possible, directly into&#13;
existing staff units in the Ministry to simplify administration, build on experience gained in the&#13;
Human Resources Project, and to enhance the transfer of technology. The implementation team&#13;
will include: a) a small Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) which will be maintained to serve as&#13;
liaison with the Bank; and b) individual technical teams to implement each of the two&#13;
components of the Project.&#13;
3.2         The Project Coordinating Unit will act as a "business office" for the Project and&#13;
will facilitate and coordinate all contacts with the Bank, all reporting and Loan disbursement&#13;
activities, and procurement. The Ministry will maintain a minimum of three staff in the PCU: a&#13;
director, procurement or financial officer, and suitable support staff. The PCU will&#13;
administratively report directly to the Deputy Secretary of State.&#13;
3.3         One technical team will be located in the Adult Labor Market Training&#13;
Department (Munkaeropiaci Kepzesek Foosztaly) of the Ministry of Labor, and will be&#13;
responsible for managing implementation of the post-secondary, job-oriented training&#13;
component. This Department has extensive and successful experience in developing and&#13;
implementing specialized modular labor market training as a result of their work on the&#13;
Regional Human Resource Development Centers under the Human Resources Project. Thus,&#13;
they are well placed to undertake similar work under the post-secondary component of the&#13;
proposed Youth Training Project. A second technical team will be located in the Youth Training&#13;
Department (Szakoktatasi Foosztaly) of the Ministry of Labor, and will be responsible for&#13;
implementation of the Secondary Vocational Training component. This Department was&#13;
responsible for the successful design and implementation of the core curriculum and vocational&#13;
orientation program under the Human Resources Project, which will be expanded under the&#13;
proposed Youth Training Project to include approximately 135 additional schools. These staff&#13;
will be supplemented by a cadre of local consultants, as needed, financed by the Government&#13;
under the Project. During Negotiations, the Government provided assurances that the Youth&#13;
Training Department (Szakoktatasi Foosztaly) will be responsible for technical implementation&#13;
of the Secondary School component, and the Adult Labor Market Training Department&#13;
(Munkaeropiaci Kepzesek Foosztaly) will be responsible for technical implementation of the&#13;
Post-Secondary Training Component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
B.   PROJECT MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
3.4         Project Coordination Unit (PCU). To help ensure that project objectives,&#13;
performance targets and schedules are met successfully, a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) has&#13;
been established in the MOL under the Human Resources Project. This unit will be maintained&#13;
under the Youth Training Project under the direction of the Deputy State Secretary. The PCU&#13;
would be responsible for coordinating all project-related tasks. During Negotiations, the&#13;
Borrower agreed that the Government will maintain a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) under the&#13;
supervision of suitably qualified Director and procurement or financial officer and supported by&#13;
support staff in adequate numbers. The day-to-day implementation of individual project&#13;
components would be the responsibility of the technical teams in the Departments for Youth&#13;
Training and Adult Labor Market Training. The PCU's role would be one of support and&#13;
facilitation.&#13;
3.5         Project Commitment and Sustainability. The Project was prepared largely by&#13;
the Ministry of Labor. During preparation, the Ministry developed individual components&#13;
through dialogue with project beneficiaries and stakeholders, including representatives from&#13;
labor and employers. A working group is being established to provide guidance for&#13;
implementation of each component of the Project. The Government has demonstrated its&#13;
commitment to the Project, inter alia, by agreeing to provide the necessary counterpart funding&#13;
for the Project, amounting to 40 percent of total costs. Finally, the Borrower has committed&#13;
itself to the staffing of small but critical technical teams to support both components.&#13;
3.6         Monitoring and Reporting. The PCU would be responsible for Project&#13;
monitoring. The Project Implementation Manual (PIM) includes a framework for systematic&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of progress in project implementation. During negotiations,&#13;
assurances were given that the contents of the Project Implementation Manual (PIM), including&#13;
terms of reference, dated July 8, 1997, were agreed. This document will serve as a technical&#13;
working document for the Project. However, it is understood that the contents of the Manual&#13;
may be updated from time-to-time if needed, with the mutual agreement of the technical staff of&#13;
the Borrower and World Bank. It identifies a set of performance indicators to be used in project&#13;
supervision. On a semi-annual basis, the PCU would submit to the Bank a consolidated report&#13;
on the status of project implementation, covering each component, its objectives and activities,&#13;
and including: a) current status and issues, b) deviations, if any, from the implementation plan&#13;
and project targets, c) recommendations for actions and forward planning, and d) actual and&#13;
planned expenditures. The Borrower will carry out, with the Bank, a mid-term review of the&#13;
project implementation about eighteen months after effectiveness. During negotiations it was&#13;
agreed that the Borrower shall: maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable it to monitor&#13;
and evaluate on an ongoing basis, in accordance with the indicators (PIM Section 3 (B)) agreed&#13;
upon between the Borrower and the Bank, the carrying out of the Project and the achievement of&#13;
the objectives thereof; prepare, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, and furnish to&#13;
the Bank, on or about May 31, 1999, report integrating the results of the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation activity activities, and review with the Bank, by June 30, 1999, or such later date as&#13;
the Bank shall request, the report. In addition, during Negotiations, assurances were given that&#13;
the May 31, 1999, project monitoring and evaluation report will include: a summary of progress&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
on each objective and activity of the Project, a summary of progress toward each project&#13;
performance and outcome indicator, a summary any issues or problems and alternative methods&#13;
of overcoming them, a financial summary comparing budgeted vs. actual expenditure for each&#13;
component and expenditure category, if appropriate and necessary recommendations for&#13;
reallocation of funds between project components and/or cost categories, and a revised&#13;
procurement plan for the remainder of the Project&#13;
3.7         Project Completion and Evaluation. Project completion is expected by&#13;
December 31, 2000. The closing date will be June 30, 2001. The PCU would be responsible for&#13;
preparing the Borrower's contribution to the Project Implementation Completion Report.&#13;
3.8         Bank Supervision. Because this is the second project with the Ministry, it is&#13;
expected that the Project would not require intensive supervision. It is estimated that an average&#13;
of 10-15 staff weeks per year, and possibly more in the first year of implementation. Project&#13;
monitoring reports and indicators, the PIM, and a careful review of project expenditures and&#13;
availability of project resources would form the basis for the supervision missions which would&#13;
be held at least twice a year. Staffing for supervision missions would need to include, in addition&#13;
to the task manager, a project implementation specialist. There will be no project launch&#13;
workshop as this is a follow-on project and the Borrower is fully conversant with Board&#13;
procedures.&#13;
3.9         Project Audits. Project Accounts and the Special Account will be audited in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects&#13;
Financed by the World Bank, dated March 1982. During negotiations agreement was reached&#13;
that the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank as soon as available, but in any case not later than six&#13;
months after then end of each fiscal year, the report of auditors, of such scope and in such detail&#13;
as the Bank shall have reasonably requested (including a separate opinion by an independent&#13;
auditor acceptable to the Bank, on disbursements against certified statements of expenses&#13;
(SOEs). The separate opinion should mention whether the SOEs submitted during the fiscal&#13;
year, together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be&#13;
relied upon to support the related withdrawal applications.&#13;
C.   PROJECT PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
3.10        Procurement of Goods. Equipment contracts which are estimated to cost more&#13;
than US$300,000 equivalent per contract will be procured following international competitive&#13;
bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement Under&#13;
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated January 1995, Revised January and August 1996. A&#13;
detailed project procurement plan appears in Annex II. Hardware and software will be primarily&#13;
procured through ICB, and will account for about 65 percent of the total equipment/materials&#13;
value (US$21.8 million out of a total equipment cost of US$30.3 million, excluding duties and&#13;
taxes). Specialized hardware and software for unique curricula, primarily in the post-secondary&#13;
component, will be primarily procured through LIB and will account for about 15 percent of the&#13;
total equipment value (US$4.9 million out of a total equipment cost of US$30.3 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
(excluding duties and taxes). Taxes for hardware and software are estimated at US$16.4 million.&#13;
The remaining 20 percent of the equipment value will be in packages suitable for procurement&#13;
other than ICB. In the comparison of bids for equipment to be procured through ICB, local&#13;
manufacturers, which have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank that: a)&#13;
labor, raw materials and components from within the country of the Borrower will account for&#13;
more than 30 percent of the ex works price of the product offered, and b) the production facility&#13;
in which the goods will be manufactured or assembled has been engaged in manufacturing/&#13;
assembling such goods at least since the time of bid submission, would receive a preference in an&#13;
amount equal to: i) the amount of duties and other related import charges which a non-exempt&#13;
importer would have to pay for the importation of the goods offered, or ii) 15 percent of the CIF&#13;
or CIP bid price of such goods if said duties and charges exceed 15 percent of such price.&#13;
Appropriate Bank standard bidding documents will be used for procurement of goods and&#13;
equipment. (The General Procurement Notice for the Project is scheduled to appear in the July&#13;
1997 edition of Development Business Forum). Table 1 of Annex II shows the major&#13;
procurement packages for goods.&#13;
Methods other than ICB&#13;
3.11        Limited International Bidding (LIB) and International Shopping (IS).&#13;
Contracts for purchase or customization of application software, and purchases of customized&#13;
and specialized hardware, estimated to cost US$4.9 million equivalent, would be awarded under&#13;
Limited International Bidding procedures in view of the fact that they would require limited&#13;
amounts of specialized hardware and software and associated services available from only a&#13;
limited number of sources. As noted in the previous paragraph, this procedure will be used for&#13;
the Post-Secondary Training component, which requires goods for a wide variety of programs&#13;
and from different suppliers. Procedures for International Shopping will be used for small&#13;
amounts of equipment where the cost of ICB and LIB would clearly outweigh possible price&#13;
advantages. Contracts for equipment and software, materials, and books, not to exceed an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$2.0 million equivalent, and up to US$300,000 per contract, may be&#13;
awarded under International Shopping procedures, based on comparing price quotations obtained&#13;
from at least three suppliers from two eligible countries, in accordance with Bank procurement&#13;
guidelines.&#13;
3.12        National Shopping (NS). Minor sundry items, such as small lots of information&#13;
technology and office equipment, not exceeding US$50,000 per contract, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$0.5 million, may be purchased on the basis of prudent national shopping by&#13;
comparing price quotations obtained from at least three local suppliers, in accordance with Bank&#13;
procurement guidelines.&#13;
3.13        Direct Contracting (DC). Goods and technical licenses which the Bank agrees:&#13;
a) are of proprietary nature, b) are required on a timely basis for efficient project implementation,&#13;
or c) need to be compatible with other installed equipment, may be procured through direct&#13;
negotiations with property and/or copyright owners, on terms and conditions acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. Such items include contracts for intellectual property such as books, technical journals,&#13;
training materials, audio-visual materials, computer applications software, including annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
upgrading and licensing arrangements, copyrights, translation and reprinting rights for training&#13;
materials for the 85 different post-secondary curricula, 7 core programs, and 13 vocational&#13;
orientation prograrns. In aggregate, these items are estimated to cost under US$1.6 million&#13;
equivalent.&#13;
3.14        Civil Works. Minor civil works to upgrade facilities to accommodate the new&#13;
and revised training programs are not included in the Project. When needed, they will be&#13;
financed entirely by the Government.&#13;
3.15        Technical Assistance. Qualified firms will be invited to submit proposals for&#13;
foreign technical assistance (TA) in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency, dated January, 1997.&#13;
Terms of reference for the two major TA components have been drafted and agreed with the&#13;
Borrower, and are contained in the Project Implementation Manual. To keep the evaluation&#13;
process manageable, no more than six (but at least three) proposals will be invited from a&#13;
shortlist acceptable to the Bank, based on the "quality and cost-based" selection process. It is&#13;
anticipated that technical assistance will be procured in two packages, totaling US$5.6 million.&#13;
As needed, the services of individual specialists or firms for advisory services will be contracted&#13;
on the basis of shortlists of eligible candidates. Out of the total TA, it is anticipated that about&#13;
US$0.3 million equivalent of the aggregate for technical assistance would be for individual&#13;
specialists.&#13;
3.16        Bank Review. For goods, the Bank shall review the Borrower's procurement&#13;
plans, decisions and procedures in accordance with Appendix 1 of the Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated January, 1995, revised January and&#13;
August 1996. In particular: a) all ICB contracts estimated to cost US$300,000 or more, which&#13;
will cover all ICB contracts; and b) all direct contracts shall be subject to prior review, in&#13;
accordance with paragraph 2 of Appendix 1 of the Guidelines. Other goods contracts costing&#13;
less than US$300,000, shall be subject to post review in accordance with paragraph 4 of the&#13;
Appendix 1 of the Guidelines. For technical assistance contracts, the applicable review&#13;
procedures are discussed in various sections of the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency, dated January, 1997.&#13;
Terms of reference for all consulting contracts would require prior review by the Bank.&#13;
Consultants contracts above $100,000 for firms and above $50,000 for individuals would require&#13;
prior review by the Bank. However, for technical assistance contracts under US$50,000 for&#13;
individuals, the Bank will require prior review of only the terns of reference and short lists of&#13;
potential consultants.&#13;

D.   DISBURSEMENT AND FINANCING SCHEDULES&#13;
3.17             Disbursements against contracts for goods costing less than US$300,000&#13;
equivalent would be made on the basis of statement of expenditures (SOEs). Statement of&#13;
Expenditures would also be used for all consulting firm contracts less than $100,000 and&#13;
individual consultants contracts less than US$50,000 and for all expenditures on training,&#13;
fellowships and studies. All related SOE documentation would be retained by MOL, the&#13;
implementing agency, and made available for subsequent examination by independent auditors&#13;
and Bank supervision missions. The proposed Project is expected to be disbursed over a period&#13;
of three years, which is considerably shorter than the relevant profile in the Region (about seven&#13;
years). The shorter implementation period is appropriate in view of the Ministry's experience in&#13;
implementing the equivalent activities under the Human Resources Project. The Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
completion date will be December 31, 2000. Disbursements of World Bank Funds will be made&#13;
as shown in Table 8.&#13;

E.   SPECIAL ACCOUNT&#13;
3.18        The Borrower will establish and maintain a Special Account (as specified in the&#13;
Loan Agreement) with an authorized allocation of US$4 million. This will be exclusively for&#13;
making payments from the proceeds of the Bank Loan. An initial deposit into the Special&#13;
Account is to be made upon the Borrower's request upon effectiveness, in the amount equivalent&#13;
to US$2 million, until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan plus outstanding&#13;
commitments entered into by the Bank shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of $4 million.&#13;
(a)   All applications for direct payment or special commitments must be for an&#13;
amount not less than 20 percent of the authorized allocation to the Special&#13;
Account, once available; and&#13;
(b)   applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted on a&#13;
monthly basis or when one third of the amount deposited has been withdrawn,&#13;
whichever occurs earlier.&#13;
F.    STATUS OF PREPARATION&#13;
3.19        The Project was appraised in May 1997 on the basis of a draft Project&#13;
Implementation Manual (PIM), which includes detailed costing and implementation schedules,&#13;
criteria and procedures for selection of participating institutions and programs, project output and&#13;
performance indicators, and sample bidding documents and Terms of Reference for technical&#13;
assistance. Procurement will be initiated for the technical assistance packages as soon as&#13;
negotiations are completed. Identification of institutions programs to be supported under the&#13;
Project will begin as soon as negotiations are completed.&#13;
&#13;

4. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.   BENEFITS&#13;
4.1         The major benefit expected from the proposed Project is to help adolescents and&#13;
young adults to make the transition from school to work, thus reducing youth unemployment.&#13;
The expanded use of the improved vocational orientation curriculum in secondary schools in&#13;
place of the former excessively narrow secondary level vocational training programs will provide&#13;
a better basis for improved productivity and improved job mobility as the economy continues to&#13;
evolve. It will also reduce recurrent costs, as unit costs for some of the new programs to be&#13;
supported under the Project are about ten percent less than for the former programs. By&#13;
supporting market-driven specialized training, the Project is expected to reduce unemployment,&#13;
thereby reducing income support payments and helping young people to make a positive&#13;
contribution to the economy.&#13;
B.    RISKS&#13;
4.2         There is a risk that project resources could be used to support training which is&#13;
either inappropriate for local labor needs, or delivered by unsuitable training providers. To&#13;
ensure that project-supported training is appropriate for local labor needs, training programs&#13;
will be developed in consultation with tripartite regional training boards, and training&#13;
providers will be required to assist with job placement of trainees and to achieve a negotiated&#13;
rate of job placement, as they are under the current Human Resources Project. In selecting&#13;
training providers under the Project, strict criteria will be applied to ensure that training&#13;
providers have the technical qualifications to provide modem, demand-driven youth training&#13;
under flexible-entry and flexible-exit programs which meet the needs of employers and&#13;
trainees.&#13;
&#13;

5. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
A.   AGREEMENTS&#13;
5.1         Agreements were reached that:&#13;
(a)   The Borrower shall ensure that training institutions included in, and programs&#13;
supported under Component A (Post Secondary Oriented Training) and&#13;
Component B (Secondary Vocational Orientation) of the Project shall meet the&#13;
criteria (Annex IV) agreed by the Borrower and the Bank (paras. 2.3b, 2.3c, 2.4a,&#13;
2,4b, and 2.5;&#13;
(b)   The Borrower shall ensure that all training proposals to be included under&#13;
Component A (Post Secondary Job-oriented Training) of the Project shall be&#13;
submitted to the Borrower's National Vocational Training Council for review and&#13;
endorsement (paras. 2.3 and 2.5);&#13;
(c)   The Adult Labor Market Training Department (Munkaeropiaci Kepzesek&#13;
Foosztaly) of the Borrower's Ministry of Labor (MOL) to be responsible for&#13;
technical implementation of Component A (Post Secondary Oriented Training) of&#13;
the Project, and Youth Training Department (Szakoktatasi Foosztaly) of MOL to&#13;
be responsible for technical implementation of Component B (Secondary&#13;
Vocational Orientation) (paras. 2.5 and 3.7);&#13;
(d)   During execution of the Project, the Borrower shall maintain Project Coordinating&#13;
Unit (PCU) under the supervision of a suitably qualified director and procurement&#13;
or financial officer and supported by support staff in adequate numbers (para.&#13;
3.8);&#13;
(e)   The Borrower shall: (i) maintain policies and procedures adequate to enable it to&#13;
monitor and evaluate on an ongoing basis, in accordance with the indicators (PIM&#13;
Section 3 (B)) agreed upon between the Borrower and the Bank, the carrying out&#13;
of the Project and the achievement of the objectives thereof; (ii) prepare, under&#13;
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, and furnish to the Bank, on or about&#13;
May 31, 1999, report integrating the results of the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
activity activities, and (iii) review with the Bank, by June 30, 1999, or such later&#13;
date as the Bank shall request, the report (para. 3.10);&#13;
(f)   The Borrower shall furnish to the Bank as soon as available, but in any case not&#13;
later than six months after the end of each fiscal year, the report of auditors, of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
such scope and in such detail as the Bank shall have reasonably requested (paras.&#13;
3.13).&#13;
5.2         Additionally, during Negotiations, assurances were given that:&#13;
(a)   The contents of the Project Implementation Manual (PIM), including terms of&#13;
reference, dated July 8, 1997, were agreed. This document will serve as a technical&#13;
working document for the Project. However, it is understood that the contents of the&#13;
Manual may be updated from time-to-time if needed, with the mutual agreement of&#13;
the technical staff of the Borrower and World Bank (para. 3. 10);&#13;
(b)   The May 31, 1999, project monitoring and evaluation report will include: (i) a&#13;
summary of progress on each objective and activity of the Project, (ii) a summary&#13;
of progress toward each project performance and outcome indicator, (iii) a&#13;
summary any issues or problems and alternative methods of overcoming them,&#13;
(iv) a financial summary comparing budgeted vs. actual expenditure for each&#13;
component and expenditure category, (v) if appropriate and necessary&#13;
recommendations for reallocation of funds between project components and/or&#13;
cost categories, and (vi) a revised procurement plan for the remainder of the&#13;
Project (para. 3.10);&#13;
(c)   Approval procedures for training under the first post-secondary component of the&#13;
Project would permit project financing of any training program which is on the&#13;
National Training List, but, for programs which are not on the list special&#13;
procedures are available to put these programs on the list if there is clear evidence&#13;
of labor-market demand (paras. 2.3(b) and 2.5);&#13;
(d)   State budget financing for vocational education in schools will be provided&#13;
through normative grants, and program financing grants will be available for other&#13;
institutions at approximately the same levels; for training carried out by private&#13;
and public secondary vocational schools, NGO Schools, and Regional Human&#13;
Resource Development Centers (paras. 2.3(c), and 2.5).&#13;
B.   RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
5.2         Subject to the above, the proposed operation would provide a suitable basis for a&#13;
Bank Loan of US$36.4 million to the Republic of Hungary under standard Bank terms.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Youth Training
            Project for Hungary is to help adolescents and young adults
            make the transition from school to work, thus reducing youth
            unemployment. To reach this objective, the project will
            provide equipment, software, and technical assistance and
            training to continue development and strengthening youth
            vocational orientation and training programs. There are two
            components. The first component strengthens and modernizes
            post-secondary and post-compulsory school specialized
            training programs for young people to facilitate their entry
            into the labor market. Its subcomponents finance technical
            assistance: 1) for project coordination and promotion,
            fellowship training, equipment, and software; 2) for writing
            teams of curriculum developers in occupational specialties;
            3) for institutional infrastructure development in
            management, operations, and procurement; and 4) for staff
            training. The second component expands the number of
            secondary vocational schools applying the new core
            curriculum and occupational orientation programs developed
            under the Hungary Human Resource Project. Its subcomponents
            provide hardware, software, and limited technical assistance
            and staff training to assist secondary vocational schools to
            implement the seven new academic core curricula for grades 9
            through 12 and to implement vocational orientation curricula
            in grades 11 and 12.
