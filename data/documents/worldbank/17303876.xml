2.    Program Objectives and Description of Activities and Themes&#13;
2.1   Objective. Given the shared need to promote a global response to the social&#13;
impact of the crises in developing countries, the World Bank is establishing a&#13;
Rapid Social Response (RSR) Program as part of the Vulnerability Financing&#13;
Facility (VFF) its overall crisis response framework. The RSR Program will&#13;
leverage the Bank's own resources through IBRD and IDA, and donor resources&#13;
through inter alia, the RSR Multi-donor Trust Fund (RSR MDTF). The objectives&#13;
of the RSR Program are to safeguard lives and livelihoods during the global crises&#13;
by promoting social protection measures such as social safety nets and&#13;
maintenance of access to basic health, education and other vital services for&#13;
communities, especially poor and vulnerable groups, and for the MDTF, in low&#13;
income countries. The RSR Program builds on lessons learned from success of&#13;
safety net programs, particularly in IBRD countries, in protecting the assets and&#13;
livelihoods of vulnerable households. The RSR will be the second window under&#13;
the VFF alongside the Global Food Crisis Response Program.&#13;
2.2   Description of Activities and Themes:&#13;
2.2.1 Activities&#13;
The RSR MDTF will fund a subset of activities under the broader themes in the&#13;
RSR Program. Eligible activities include:&#13;
A)    Country-level Technical Assistance and Capacity Building in IDA-&#13;
eligible countries aimed at improving the design, effectiveness and sustainability&#13;
of social protection policies and programs focused on supporting crisis responses&#13;
via safety nets, labor market and employment programs and protecting access to&#13;
basic social services for the poor and vulnerable. This work, which can be Bank-&#13;
or Recipient Country-executed, will include:&#13;
*  Diagnostics and analysis of a country's current systems;&#13;
*  Design and strategy development to build or improve systems;&#13;
*  Assessment of policies and programs in the agreed areas of intervention,&#13;
either for immediate response or to improve systems for longer term&#13;
policies and programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-7-&#13;
Systems may include inter alia, establishment of identification numbers of&#13;
potential clients (including ID, birth or death registries), outreach and&#13;
communications, effective targeting systems; identification and enrollment&#13;
of beneficiaries; payment systems; control and accountability mechanisms&#13;
to prevent, detect and correct fraud and error, grievance mechanisms,&#13;
mechanisms for procurement of inputs (especially for in-kind programs) or&#13;
services (especially for training programs); mechanisms for coordination&#13;
with, monitoring the performance of, or contracting of partners in service&#13;
delivery whether public, private for profit or private not for profit (e.g. pay&#13;
agents, training agents, auditors, sub-contractors, NGOs and FBOs, sub-&#13;
national or local governments or partner ministries and their operational&#13;
units), management information systems, monitoring systems and&#13;
assessments of targeting, process and impact.&#13;
B)    Direct Grants to IDA-eligible countries for piloting of promising&#13;
approaches and innovations, and for scaling up program benefits. This work is&#13;
typically Recipient Country-executed; however where country implementation&#13;
capacity is weak, the country, Bank, UN, and donor(s) may agree to UN&#13;
implementation under the UN-FPA.&#13;
C)    Knowledge Management, Trust Fund Management, Coordination,&#13;
and Supervision. Knowledge Management may include creation, documentation&#13;
and dissemination of diagnostic techniques or program practices using a full range&#13;
of techniques, for various single program cases or across a range of program types&#13;
or systems issues with the objective of delivering cross-country and cross-sectoral&#13;
learning. South-South knowledge sharing activities may be financed to include&#13;
IBRD countries in addition to IDA-eligible countries. Fund Management and&#13;
Coordination may include work carried out by the RSR Program Management&#13;
team as well as direct grant supervision and grant development. This work is&#13;
Bank-executed.&#13;
2.2.2  Themes under the RSR MDTF and examples of interventions.&#13;
A)    Safety Nets Systems: support for the design, development and&#13;
implementation of good safety nets to address current and future vulnerability&#13;
including:&#13;
* Cash transfers - unconditional or conditional. Cash transfer programs are&#13;
programs that transfer cash to eligible pdople or households. Common&#13;
variants include child allowances, social pensions, needs-based transfers,&#13;
and conditional cash transfers, which require that beneficiary household&#13;
enroll their children in school, ensure their regular attendance and obtain&#13;
basic preventive health care services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-8-&#13;
*  School feeding and other in-kind transfer programs. School feeding&#13;
programs are in-kind food transfers that provide meals or snacks for&#13;
children at school to encourage their enrollment and improve their&#13;
nutritional status and ability to pay attention in class. Food rations may&#13;
also be distributed through clinics, often to those that serve poor areas, to&#13;
pregnant and lactating women or for their young children.&#13;
*  Labor-intensive public works. Public works programs (or workfare) are&#13;
programs where income support for the poor is given in the form of wages&#13;
(in either cash or food) in exchange for work effort. These programs&#13;
typically  provide  short-term  employment  at  low  wages   for&#13;
unskilled/semiskilled workers on labor-intensive projects such as road&#13;
construction and maintenance, irrigation infrastructure, reforestation, and&#13;
soil conservation.&#13;
* Fee waivers for essential services such as education, health care, heating&#13;
and lighting. Fee waivers and scholarships for schooling are also known&#13;
as stipends (usually paid in cash to households), education vouchers&#13;
(coupons that households use to purchase education or inputs to&#13;
education), targeted bursaries, and interventions related to tuition and&#13;
textbooks. All such mechanisms are meant to assist households in meeting&#13;
the costs of schooling. Fee waivers for health are waivers granted to&#13;
individuals based on their personal characteristics (such as poverty),&#13;
relieving them of the need to pay for health services for which charges&#13;
usually apply.&#13;
B)    Labor Markets and      Employment:     providing  diagnostics and&#13;
formulating, implementing and evaluating policies that help protect workers&#13;
during the crisis by stabilizing employment and earnings such as:&#13;
*  Income support for the unemployed, in manners appropriate to the&#13;
pertinent segments of the labor market and country context, including but&#13;
not limited to unemployment insurance, unemployment assistance, and&#13;
unemployment savings accounts.&#13;
*  Training for recently dismissed workers, or unemployed workers from&#13;
vulnerable groups such as youth. Youth programs would preferably be&#13;
based on comprehensive programs that integrate training for technical&#13;
skills, job readiness skills, and internships, targeted to meet the needs of&#13;
the local labor market. Models include the "Jovenes" programs that have&#13;
been shown promising results in Colombia and the Dominican Republic.&#13;
*  Support for public employment services that provide job information and&#13;
placement services for the recently unemployed. Services include the&#13;
establishment of job clubs, the provision of job-search courses,&#13;
counseling, testing, and assessment, along the lines of the programs&#13;
instituted in Romania in the late 1990's.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-9-&#13;
* Policy reforms to support international migrant workers, including the&#13;
establishment and monitoring of service standards for educational and&#13;
preparation programs.&#13;
C)     Protecting Access to Basic social Services for the Poor, including&#13;
Nutrition, Health and Education, including:&#13;
*  In-country capacity building and institutional strengthening for design,&#13;
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of health and nutrition&#13;
programs to prevent irreversible damage from the crisis, especially&#13;
programs focused on the nutritional "window of opportunity" (from pre-&#13;
pregnancy until two years of age), micronutrient supplementation or&#13;
fortification, and nutrition during humanitarian crises and emergencies.&#13;
* Use of instruments to facilitate affordable access to basic services, such as&#13;
vouchers to keep vulnerable children who are attending private/NGO&#13;
schools in school, for institutional deliveries in low cost non-government&#13;
facilities, capitation payments to service providers who eliminate fees for&#13;
the poor, etc.&#13;
3.     Categories of Expenditures:&#13;
3.1    For Bank-Executed activities, the Contributions may be used to finance the following&#13;
categories of expenditures: Consultant fees, contractual services, extended term&#13;
consultants, media &amp; workshop costs, staff costs, temporary support staff costs (for&#13;
Program administration), travel expenses, and associated overheads.&#13;
3.2    For Recipient-Executed activities, the Contributions may be used to finance the&#13;
following categories of expenditures: goods, works, services, and "other", in accordance&#13;
with the provisions of the individual Grant Agreements providing Grants for such&#13;
Projects.&#13;
3.3    For UN   Execution of Fiduciary - Principles Accord (FPA) Projects.  The&#13;
Contributions may be used to finance FPA Projects and categories of expenditures in&#13;
accordance with the FPA Standard Provisions and the respective UN entity&#13;
implementing the FPA Project.&#13;
4.     Governance Structure&#13;
4.1    General.  The RSR MDTF will fund a subset of activities within the broader&#13;
RSR Program. As such, it will operate largely within the governance framework&#13;
of the RSR Program, which in turn is part of the Vulnerability Financing Facility&#13;
(VFF).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿- 10 -&#13;
4.2   The RSR Program Steering Committee:&#13;
Chaired by a World Bank Managing Director and comprising World Bank Vice&#13;
Presidents, the RSR Program Steering Committee defines and directs the overall&#13;
RSR Program and resource allocation strategy. The Steering Committee approves&#13;
overall RSR Program priorities based on inputs provided by the RSR Program&#13;
Management Team.&#13;
4.3   The RSR MDTF Consultative Group&#13;
Comprising the RSR MDTF donors and representatives of the Bank, the RSR&#13;
MDTF Consultative Group provides overall strategic direction, guidance and&#13;
advice for the RSR MDTF within the parameters established for the RSR&#13;
Program. The Consultative Group reviews the RSR MDTF work program&#13;
performance and progress.&#13;
4.4   The RSR Program Management Committee&#13;
Comprising the Human Development Network Management Team, headed by the&#13;
HDN Vice President, the RSR Program Management Committee makes day-to-&#13;
day decisions about the operations of the RSR Program, including approving&#13;
funding proposals for the MDTF.&#13;
4.5   The RSR Program Management Team&#13;
The RSR Program Management Team will support the day-to-day operations of&#13;
the RSR Program, including the administration of the RSR MDTF. It will operate&#13;
alongside of, and coordinate closely with, the existing Global Food Crisis&#13;
Response Program Secretariat (GFRP Secretariat).&#13;
The RSR Program Management Team will include a Team Lead/MDTF Fund&#13;
Manager and a number of Social Protection and Operations Specialists. The RSR&#13;
Program Management Team will, among other things, review all proposals for&#13;
RSR MDTF funding for relevance to its objectives and adherence to eligibility&#13;
criteria, while quality assurance of funded activities will remain the responsibility&#13;
of the relevant sector units within the Regional Vice Presidencies.&#13;
5.    Project Processing; Governing Policies and Procedures&#13;
