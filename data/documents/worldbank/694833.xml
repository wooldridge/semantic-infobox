Note No. 114   Designing Regulatory Institutions for&#13;
Infrastructure-Lessons from Argentina&#13;
Antonio Estacbe   As in many aspects of infrastructure reform, Argentina has been a leader in experimenting with&#13;
the design of regulatory agencies. This Note describes the essential elements of good regulatory&#13;
agency design-independence, autonomy, expertise, and accountability-and rates Argentina's&#13;
performance against these benchmarks in the gas, power, water, and telecommunications sec-&#13;
tors. The Note concludes that the biggest challenges to design are achieving political indepen-&#13;
dence and establishing rules to ensure regulatory accountability.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In 1989, the Argentine government
            initiated rapid privatization of infrastructure
            services-mainly gas, telecoms, electricity generation and
            transmission, and water and electricity distribution in the
            Buenos Aires metropolitan area.  The author reviews the
            performance of the agencies set up to regulate the
            privatized utilities against criteria for good design:
            independence, autonomy, expertise, and accountability.  His
            assessment: the Argentine experience so far shows that the
            biggest challenges to regulatory design are achieving
            political independence and introducing rules to ensure accountability.
