URBAN WORKS AND MICROENTERPRISE PILOT PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:            Government of Albania&#13;
Executing Agency:   Albanian Development Fund'&#13;
Benericiaries:       Urban inhabitants of eight pilot municipalities&#13;
Credit Amount:       SDR 2.6 million (US$4.0 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:               Forty years maturity with a ten year grace period. Credit proceeds will be lent&#13;
to the Government at the standard IDA charge.&#13;
Onlending Rate:      The proceeds of the credit would be made available to the Albanian Development&#13;
Fund on a grant basis. Subloans to microentrepreneurs would be provided at&#13;
commercial interest rates.&#13;
Project Objectives:   The pilot project would help the Government to develop a five-year program to&#13;
boost employment and small-scale economic activity in urban areas, based on the&#13;
successful approach of the Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project (Cr. 2461-&#13;
ALB). Objectives of the proposed five-year Urban Works and Microenterprise&#13;
Pilot Program would be (a) to create employment and stimulate private-sector&#13;
activity in urban areas; (b) to repair basic urban infrastructure; (c) to promote&#13;
microenterprises; and (d) to assist local governments obtain the skills they need&#13;
for promoting economic development in the long term.&#13;
Project Description:  The pilot project would test approaches to the program's implementation during&#13;
its first two years. Pilot project components are:&#13;
(a) Establish the necessary implementation framework for the proposed&#13;
program by expanding the existing Rural Development Fund into an&#13;
Albanian Development Fund.&#13;
(b) Urban works. Organize approximately 30 public works, which would&#13;
rehabilitate small infrastructure, create needed market facilities, or address&#13;
environmental problems.&#13;
(c) Small-scale credit and microenterprise support. Disburse approximately&#13;
2,000 small loans (US$300-5,000) to potential microentrepreneurs and test&#13;
credit delivery methods. In addition, provide technical and business advice&#13;
to potential microentrepreneurs and test about five microenterprise&#13;
demonstration projects in key subsectors.&#13;
I/    The Albanian Development fund was established by the Council of Ministers as the successor to the Rural&#13;
Development Fund (Government decision 427, September 8, 1994).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
(d) Studies and training. Studies would be undertaken to evaluate project&#13;
impact. Training and study tours would be used to help local governments&#13;
to acquire the skills needed for promoting long-term local development.&#13;
Environmental&#13;
Aspects:            The project has been placed in environmental screening category "B," consistent&#13;
with provisions of Operational Directive 4.01. The extremely small scale of&#13;
project activities makes any significant negative environmental impact unlikely.&#13;
Some public works could have an environmental focus.  Environmental&#13;
guidelines and checklists for rural works developed under the Rural Poverty&#13;
Alleviation Pilot Project (RPAPP) would be adapted for urban infrastructure&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
Benefits:           Direct and immediate benefits would flow from the labor-intensive public works,&#13;
which would inject cash resources into the urban economy and create over 5,000&#13;
months of employment, and the small loans, which would allow potential&#13;
microentrepreneurs to undertake income-generating activities. Improved urban&#13;
infrastructure would help provide an environment conducive to increased trade&#13;
and market activity. By focusing on microenterprise development, the project&#13;
would boost market activities in urban areas, while benefiting the most needy.&#13;
The demonstration projects to be initiated by private entrepreneurs would&#13;
introduce practical, sustainable models of microenterprises that are widely&#13;
replicable and would promote new forms of production and marketing. By&#13;
training municipal officials, the project would also provide the framework for&#13;
improved long-term local development and planning by municipalities.&#13;
Risks:              Potential risks include deterioration in the macroeconomic environment and&#13;
political interference. Political risks would be minimized by paying special&#13;
attention to the establishment and use of written operational guidelines. The&#13;
development of an appropriate mechanism for credit delivery would be critical&#13;
to the component's success; careful follow-up and monitoring of the credit&#13;
program would be undertaken to mitigate design and repayment risks. Project&#13;
implementation capacity is considered adequate given the experience under the&#13;
RPAPP. Project-specific risk should be minimized because the project would be&#13;
built with the full participation of local authorities and stakeholders. Moreover,&#13;
the process approach provides for continuous adjustment of the program in&#13;
accordance with local needs and constraints, as long as project feedback is&#13;
effectively incorporated.&#13;

URBAN WORKS AND MICROENTERPRISE PILOT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
CHAPTER I. ALBANIA'S CHALLENGE:&#13;
DEVELOPING EMPLOYMENT IN A MARKET ECONOMY&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.1   Economic Collapse. Albania's recent emergence from forty-five years of strict central planning&#13;
and self-imposed isolation was accompanied by a severe economic crisis. With no alternative economic&#13;
institutions in place, the abolishment of central planning resulted in a collapse of production&#13;
unprecedented even for Eastern Europe: GDP fell by 40 percent from 1990 to mid-1992, the&#13;
Government's budget deficit ballooned to 44 percent of GDP in the first half of 1992, and inflation&#13;
spiraled to 10-15 percent a month. Once an agricultural exporter, Albania became heavily dependent on&#13;
food aid. Perhaps hardest hit was Albania's industrial sector; budget restrictions and lack of financial&#13;
discipline, failure to adapt to the market economy, and, in many cases, obsolete equipment led to a 20&#13;
percent real industrial output decline in 1990, followed by a 37 percent decline in 1991, and a 60 percent&#13;
decline in 1992.&#13;
1.2   Stabilization of the Macroeconomic Environment. Shortly after the first fully democratic&#13;
elections in Albania in March 1992, the Government embarked on a comprehensive program of reforms.&#13;
In accordance with a twelve-month IMF stand-by arrangement, the Government's program included&#13;
stabilization measures and structural reforms to initiate the move toward a market economy. The budget&#13;
deficit was cut in half, strict monetary targets were enforced, interest rates were increased, and the&#13;
automatic extension of bank credit to state enterprises was stopped. All food and agriculture prices were&#13;
freed, save for four basic items, whose prices were increased 200-500 percent. The currency was floated,&#13;
private exchange transactions legalized, and all current account transactions liberalized.  Quick&#13;
mobilization of international aid supported the program.&#13;
1.3    After Government's adoption of this comprehensive program of reforms in mid-1992, the&#13;
macroeconomic environment stabilized: inflation fell dramatically, agricultural production increased, and&#13;
the Lek remained fairly stable. In June 1993, the Government adopted a medium-term economic program&#13;
in consultation with the IMF and World Bank that established an ambitious program of reforms for 1993-&#13;
1996 to further reduce financial imbalances and bring about a structural transformation of the economy.&#13;
In mid-1994, the Government assessed the initial implementation of its program and, in light of the&#13;
positive results, adopted more ambitious macroeconomic objectives for 1994-1997.&#13;
1.4    While further progress on a number of key structural reforms is still necessary, the&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization program has reached-even surpassed-its principle objectives. Spiraling&#13;
inflation has been reversed (1994 inflation was about 15 percent, 1995 inflation is projected at 10&#13;
percent), the Government's budget deficit has been slashed (13 percent of GDP in 1994, 14 percent of&#13;
GDP projected for 1995), and the severe fall in production has been halted-1993 real GDP growth was&#13;
11 percent, 1994 growth was 7 percent, and 1995 growth is projected at 6 percent. The challenge now&#13;
is to turn the early success of the stabilization program into the development of a strong market economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. An Emerging Private Sector&#13;
1.5    The private sector, nonexistent prior to 1991, is now estimated to constitute more than 60 percent&#13;
of GDP, an impressive increase largely attributable to the rapid privatization of agriculture (agriculture&#13;
accounts for 50 percent of value added). Until privatization began in 1991, agricultural production was&#13;
dominated by the cooperatives-which held 76 percent of arable land-and the state farms, with 24&#13;
percent. Excluding land that is unsuitable for arable farming and will be reclassified as pasture land, 98&#13;
percent of agricultural land has now been privatized, creating over 400,000 private farm families. As&#13;
a result of this rapid privatization and of price liberalization, the agricultural sector achieved growth of&#13;
18 percent in 1992, 14 percent in 1993, and nearly 7 percent in 1994.&#13;
1.6   In contrast to the recovery of agriculture, the industrial sector-which once accounted for 45&#13;
percent of gross income and 24 percent of the labor force-remains in an almost total state of collapse,&#13;
and registered yet another output decline in 1993 (10 percent) and in 1994 (2 percent).2 There are about&#13;
300 large state-owned enterprises, most of which are operating at a fraction of their capacity. The&#13;
Government has created an Enterprise Restructuring Agency to restructure-and eventually privatize (or&#13;
liquidate)-thirty of the most serious cases. The Government is also engaged in a mass privatization&#13;
program that intends to accelerate the privatization of ownership, particularly of medium and large&#13;
enterprises, during 1995-96.&#13;
1.7    Small and medium enterprises have been the most dynamic sector in Albania. There are about&#13;
46,000 registered private enterprises employing 117,000 persons (78 percent have only one employee).3&#13;
Of these 46,000 enterprises, 20 percent are located in Tirana, and 54 percent are involved with trade.&#13;
In March 1995, the private sector accounted for 96 percent of total imports and 56 percent of total&#13;
exports.&#13;
1.8    Urban Unemployment.  It will take considerable time before industry is privatized and&#13;
modernized and able to again absorb a large part of the urban labor force. Meanwhile, urban&#13;
unemployment is a critical-and growing-problem. In March 1995, about 16 percent of Albania's&#13;
estimated labor force was registered as unemployed; 4 percent was registered as unemployed in rural&#13;
areas, and 34 percent in urban areas, where 40 percent of Albania's population lives. Registration is not&#13;
obligatory and could underestimate true unemployment.4 On average, 6 percent of the urban labor force&#13;
receives unemployment benefits; benefits are paid for a maximum of twelve months, and most benefits&#13;
expired in 1993 and early 1994. There was a 38 percent drop in the number of recipients of&#13;
unemployment benefits from  December 1993 to April 1994 (see Annex A.1).  Nevertheless,&#13;
unemployment is a persistent problem as state-owned enterprises continue to downsize or liquidate.&#13;
1.9    Economic Assistance. A comprehensive economic assistance program (ndihmn ekonomike) went&#13;
into effect on July 1, 1993. Administered by municipalities and communes, it provides support toward&#13;
a minimum family income. In 19 of Albania's forty-four municipalities, over 20 percent of families&#13;
receive economic assistance, as shown in Table 1.1 and Annex A.2. However, since ndihme ekonomike&#13;
is funded by a block-grant from the central government (it is not an open-ended needs-based program),&#13;
_/    In all, industrial production has fallen by 82 percent since 1989.&#13;
3/    Institute of Statistics, March 1995.&#13;
41    It particularly underestimates rural unemployment (and undertmploymont)--i-cooperaeivo workers are not eligible&#13;
for unemployment benefits and therefore are not motivated to register with the Ministry of Labor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
it could underrepresent poverty-not all eligible families receive the arnount to which are theoretically&#13;
entitled. Monthly fluctuations in the number of families reflect changes in budget allocations and&#13;
implementation capacity rather than changes in family income. Faced with limited resources for the&#13;
program, local governments may choose to give a greater number of families partial benefits, or a fewer&#13;
number full benefits.&#13;
1.10   About 25 percent of the urban labor force depends on unemployment benefits or ndihml&#13;
ekonomike, burdening Albania's meager budget resources. In 1994, about US$71 million-16 percent&#13;
of Albania's total budget expenditures-were spent on unemployment compensation and ndihm.9&#13;
ekonomike. Flexible programs need to be introduced that combine poverty alleviation with private-sector&#13;
development.&#13;

1.11    Programs to Support Small and Medium  Enterprises. There are three main programs that&#13;
support small and medium enterprises in Albania: I&#13;
(a) The ORT Hunan Resource Development Program, financed by USAID, has provided adult&#13;
training to about 3,000 Albanians-especially ex-political prisoners-since its inception in&#13;
January 1992. The program, which is currently established in the municipalities of Tirana,&#13;
Durres, Vlora, and Shkoder, offers six to twelve week courses on topics that include&#13;
5/      See also Annex E, pams. 29-38.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
cosmetology, English, secretarial skills, tourism, and auto mechanics.  The program is&#13;
expected to end in 1996.&#13;
(b) The EU-funded SME Development Project provides credit, training, and business advice to&#13;
small and medium-scale enterprises. During its first phase, which began in February 1992,&#13;
about 155 loans were disbursed averaging US$10,000, but loan recovery was very&#13;
unsatisfactory. The project was recently restructured, and is expected to disburse larger loans&#13;
(average size US$15,000) during its second phase.&#13;
(c) The Training, Enterprise, and Employment Fund (TEEF) was created in May 1993 under the&#13;
IDA-financed Labor Market Development Project to finance adult training courses and job-&#13;
insertion subprojects and the creation of small business incubators and small business clubs.&#13;
Adult training is offered on a demand-driven basis for such activities as computer training,&#13;
cooking, and construction. Job-insertion subprojects assist enterprises by financing three&#13;
months of training for a minimum of twenty new employees. Participating enterprises, which&#13;
may be foreign or local, include shoe and clothing manufacturers, construction companies,&#13;
and bakeries.&#13;
There remains an important need and opportunity, however, to assist microenterprise development, such&#13;
as self employment or economic activities requiring less than US$5,000 in investment.&#13;
1.12   The Potential for Microenterprise Development. Many of those currently unemployed could,&#13;
if given access to credit and proper technical support, become microentrepreneurs, either starting a small&#13;
trade activity or using their professional skills for services or production; a wide range of activities are&#13;
still needed to replace activities formerly undertaken by the state. Potential microbusiness activities that&#13;
have been identified include: small trade, services (repairing of television sets, bicycles, etc.), artisanal&#13;
production of all types (soap, carpets, candles, furniture, sweets, tailoring, shoe making), and basic&#13;
construction and rehabilitation. Potential microentrepreneurs are constrained, however, by lack of credit,&#13;
business know-how, and appropriate small-scale technology.&#13;
1.13   Potential microentrepreneurs do not have access to formal bank credit, and informal credit,&#13;
provided at an interest rate of 5-10 percent monthly, is available mainly for large trade activities (greater&#13;
than US$10,000).6 Microentrepreneurs currently must rely on remittances from family members abroad&#13;
or very small loans from relatives. Many of those currently unemployed or receiving economic&#13;
assistance, however, have no access to such sources. Consequently, there is a very large potential&#13;
clientele for loans between US$300 and US$5,000 for developing services, trade, and small production&#13;
activities, and there is currently no program in Albania for delivering credit to such clients.&#13;
1.14   Urban Infrastructure. Meanwhile, urban infrastructure-poor to begin with-is deteriorating,&#13;
thereby providing a further obstacle to market development, and it is coming under increasing pressure&#13;
from migration. (A part of the rural population in isolated mountain areas with insufficient arable land&#13;
will inevitably migrate, and despite government attempts to discourage migration, squatter settlements&#13;
have already formed in most urban centers.) Large infrastructure projects, such as water supply and&#13;
sanitation, remain largely the concern of the central government and are being addressed by projects such&#13;
as the IDA-supported Durres Water Supply Rehabilitation Project. In accordance with the Government's&#13;
policy of decentralization and deconcentration of central government operations, however, significant&#13;
economic and administrative authority is being transferred and delegated to local government, including&#13;
infrastructure investment and maintenance.&#13;

1.15   Local Government in Transition. The June 1992 Law on the Functioning and Administration&#13;
of Local Goverrunent (No. 7572) reorganized and gave greater powers to local governments, especially&#13;
to the 44 newly-created municipalities and 312 communes. There are still many issues of local&#13;
government and decentralization to be resolved, including, importantly, local budget and finance.' While&#13;
the final outcome of decentralization is yet to be determined, it is already clear that local government,&#13;
having no previous experience in market-economy administration and few resources, is ill-equipped to&#13;
handle the responsibilities being transferred and delegated. Most roads and other urban infrastructure are&#13;
now the responsibility of districts and newly-created municipalities. Municipalities are not only&#13;
unprepared to undertake proper maintenance, but probably unable to address the many new infrastructural&#13;
needs associated with privatization and a market economy. Nor can local government be expected to&#13;
develop the very innovative local development programs desperately needed to initiate and nurture a&#13;
private sector.&#13;
C. Government's Interim Strategy&#13;
1.16   To complement its policy of economic stabilization at the macro level, the Government has&#13;
endorsed a strategy of restarting urban economic activity and boosting employment-on a free-market&#13;
basis-from the bottom up. This approach, which seeks to fill in the gaps of existing programs, focuses&#13;
on:&#13;
Actively alleviating unemployment: The high unemployment rate now existing in urban areas&#13;
is likely to increase as more state-owned enterprises shut down or restructure and as families&#13;
living in isolated rural areas migrate to urban centers. The first challenge for the Government&#13;
is to develop employment and prevent the creation of severe urban poverty and large income&#13;
inequalities. A second opportunity is to restore the value of work and entrepreneurship while&#13;
gradually cutting dependency on the state maintained by ndihme ekonomike (economic assistance).&#13;
Promoting the small private sector: Privatizing and restructuring state enterprises will require&#13;
time, capital, and management capabilities. Privatization should be complemented by a small&#13;
business development policy, which requires introducing new models of production, opening&#13;
access to credit, and organizing marketing networks. While informal sector activities are a first&#13;
positive sign of economic initiative, such activities should gradually move to the formal sector&#13;
and contribute to the tax base.&#13;
Repairing basic urban infrastructure: Adequate infrastructure is a prerequisite for economic&#13;
and social development; yet, practically all municipalities lack basic market facilities, and existing&#13;
infrastructure is severely dilapidated. Some of the rehabilitation and construction work required&#13;
in urban areas can be undertaken in conjunction with public works, employing local labor to&#13;
alleviate poverty, or in conjunction with programs to encourage microenterprise development.&#13;
Strengthening local governments:  The newly-created municipalities lack both financial&#13;
resources and experience in local development practices within a market-driven economy.&#13;
Making financial resources available for infrastructure investment responds to their immediate&#13;
needs; training, exchanges, and other support will introduce improved methods of local economic&#13;
development.&#13;

D. Using the Experience of the Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project&#13;
1.17   Help for the poor in rural areas, which is being addressed by the IDA-supported Rural Poverty&#13;
Alleviation Pilot Project (RPAPP)l provides some guidance on how to deal with the problem in urban&#13;
areas. The RPAPP became effective in April 1993, following six months of pre-pilot actions funded by&#13;
the UNDP and a French NGO. An autonomous agency, the Rural Development Fund, was established&#13;
by Government to implement the RPAPP's three components-(a) rural works; (b) small-scale credit; and&#13;
(c) studies, training, and transfer of technology. The Rural Development Fund has subsequently been&#13;
transformed by Government into the Albanian Development Fund (ADF). Under the pilot project&#13;
operational procedures and mechanisms of technical and financial control were developed. Bank&#13;
experience to date has been extremely good, and the findings of an OED performance audit were highly&#13;
positive.9 Overall, the participatory, process approach has proven an effective method by which to&#13;
develop a grassroots, demand-driven project in Albania's transition environment, while providing for&#13;
rapid and visible results. The project has demonstrated that local government-communes and&#13;
villages-are reliable partners, and that basic project methodology for rural works and small-scale credit&#13;
appears effective.&#13;
1.18   Rural Works. As of June 1, 1995, 188 labor-intensive works in 135 communes and 24 districts&#13;
have been financed (91 of which are completed) at an average cost of US$16,000 per subproject. The&#13;
rehabilitated infrastructure is directly benefitting a population of 300,000, and corresponds to over&#13;
600,000 days of employment (wages have averaged 30 percent of subproject cost). Subprojects are&#13;
demand driven according to the needs of villages, and the works are carried out by communes, which&#13;
sign contracts with the ADF and hire unemployed village workers for unskilled labor. Subprojects are&#13;
closely supervised by ADF engineers, and commune technical staff receive appropriate training in&#13;
planning, costing, and implementing infrastructure rehabilitation projects in a market-economy&#13;
environment. To assure adequate maintenance of the rehabilitated infrastructure, user associations and&#13;
maintenance funds are being created when appropriate.&#13;
1.19   Village Credit Funds. Under the RPAPP, village credit funds (VCF) are established to provide&#13;
small loans (average size US$350) for income-generating activity. As of May 1, 1995, 63 VCFs have&#13;
disbursed 3,121 subloans. The ADF establishes the VCF in the RCB. A village credit committee,&#13;
comprised of at least three elected village officials and a representative of the ADF, makes loan decisions,&#13;
determines collateral, and supervises loan repayment. Village solidarity is an important loan repayment&#13;
incentive: loan default may result in loss of the credit line for the village. Loan repayment, which started&#13;
in November 1993, has been nearly 100 percent (it has been 100 percent in all but one village). Savings&#13;
mobilization is now being tested under the component.&#13;
1.20   Transfer of Technology. Experimental actions to transfer small-scale technology were started&#13;
in late 1993. Three potential agroprocessing demonstration projects were identified, one of which-a goat&#13;
cheese production/demonstration unit-is expected to be fully operational in 1995.&#13;
8/     The foUow -up Rural Development Project (Cr. 2680-ALB), which would fuiance a core program to continue and&#13;
expand RPAPP components for thuee years, was approved by the Bank's Board of Directors on Februazy 14, 1995&#13;
and became effective on May 23, 1995. The total project cost im US$12 million, of which US$6.0 million is an IDA&#13;
credit.&#13;
9/     An OED mnission was undertaken from June 6-10, 1994 to evaluate the pilot project prior to the appraisal of the full-&#13;
scale project. The PPAR was presented to the Board of Directors in January 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.21   Lessons Learned. The overall lessons learned from the RPAPP are: (a) a bottom-up, 'learning-&#13;
by-doing" approach is an effective method for developing a flexible, demand-driven project in a transition&#13;
economy while providing for immediate and visible results; it provides for built-in adaptability to a&#13;
changing environment; and (b) the participation of beneficiaries in the design of programs can lead to&#13;
greater ownership and reduced risk, especially regarding credit.&#13;
E. The Urban Works and Microenterprise Program&#13;
1.22   The government has requested that a program similar to the Rural Poverty Alleviation Program&#13;
be developed to respond to the serious problems of unemployment and poverty in urban areas, created&#13;
by the difficult transition process. Like the Rural Poverty Alleviation Program, the proposed Urban&#13;
Works and Microenterprise Program would be built from the bottom up, first identifying the needs and&#13;
constraints of the municipalities and potential microentrepreneurs, then working with them to develop&#13;
methods and procedures. Project activities would be adjusted continually according to feedback and&#13;
results.&#13;
1.23   The proposed program is being implemented in a phased way as follows:&#13;
Phase 1&#13;
Pre-pilot phase, underway since February 1994, is testing organizational and technical&#13;
approaches; financing is being provided by a Japanese PHRD grant (US$400,000); the UNDP&#13;
(US$100,000); the Foundation pour le Progres de L'Homme, a Swiss foundation (US$100,000);&#13;
and Freres d'Esperance, a French NGO (US$13,000).&#13;
Phase 2&#13;
Pilot phase, to be supported by IDA and Government (US$4.4 million), would focus on further&#13;
testing and designing project components for two years; activities would be focused in selected&#13;
municipalities. This is the project described in this Staff Appraisal Report.&#13;
Phase 3&#13;
Full-scale project, amounting to approximately US$18 million, could be cofinanced by IDA and&#13;
other donors if the pilot phase is successful and if the Government decides to continue project&#13;
activities. It would extend the project to all remaining urban areas for an additional three years.&#13;
1.24   This process approach allows the program to be adjusted to local needs and constraints as the&#13;
lessons drawn from each phase are used to prepare the next one. It will also allow for-in fact&#13;
encourage-participation by local people and institutions.&#13;
1.25   The proposed Urban Works and Microenterprise Program would take about five years and would&#13;
cost about US$22 million.  During this period, about 120 urban infrastructure subprojects would be&#13;
realized, the average cost of which is estimated at US$48,000 the first year, rising to US$63,000 in the&#13;
fourth year. On average, the program would finance three or four subprojects per municipality, enough&#13;
to have a significant impact but still far below the real needs. The program would also finance over&#13;
8,000 small credits and would provide technical or business advice to over 1,000 microentrepreneurs.&#13;
Estimated component costs are shown in Table 1.2.&#13;

1.26   A Modular Approach. The pilot project and full-scale program lend themselves easily to a&#13;
modular approach, whereby project area and component intensity can be scaled in accordance with&#13;
financing resources available. For example, the pilot project could be expanded if supplemental&#13;
cofinancing is secured, as was the case for the Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project when supplemental&#13;
cofinancing from the Italian Government was used to finance additional project districts.10&#13;
F. The Pre-Pilot Phase "&#13;
1.27   The pre-pilot phase of the Urban Works and Microenterprise Program, which began in February&#13;
1994 under the responsibility of the RDF, is contributing valuable experience for the development of&#13;
project components.&#13;
1.28   Urban works. Two infrastructure subprojects have been carried out during the pre-pilot&#13;
phase-the rehabilitation of Shkoder's central market (floor slabs and installation of water and&#13;
electricity-US$46,000) and the rehabilitation of a marketplace in Shijak (US$30,000). In Shkoder, the&#13;
subproject was undertaken by a private contractor selected by local shopping; in Shijak, a recently-&#13;
established private enterprise was selected to encourage private-sector growth. A second phase of the&#13;
rehabilitation of the Shkoder market (installation of market stalls and rehabilitation of the meat&#13;
market-about US$110,000) is expected to begin in June 1995, partly financed by pre-pilot funds. These&#13;
subprojects have contributed to the development of an urban works methodology. The Shijak subproject&#13;
was halted due to land re-privatization conflicts, which has led to a redesign of the model contract to be&#13;
used between the ADF and municipalities. The main differences between rural and urban works are: (a)&#13;
In urban areas, it is difficult to organize the participation of inhabitants in selecting the subprojects, as&#13;
practiced in villages. Rather, the subprojects are proposed by the municipal governments. (b) Given the&#13;
magnitude of municipal infrastructural needs, subprojects represent a smaller relative impact than in&#13;
villages. However, the long-term impact of training local government staff is more important in cities.&#13;
(c) In urban areas, there is a rapid growth in private contractors to carry out civil works, which is not&#13;
yet the case in isolated rural areas where local shopping procedures are used only for materials. Working&#13;
10/    As of May 1995, the EU Phare is considering to finance a U$10 million Local Communities Program, which would&#13;
consist of rural and urban works (infrastructure rehabilitation), and which could be implemented by the Albanian&#13;
Development Fund.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
with private construction companies costs about 30 percent more than the methods currently used in rural&#13;
areas.&#13;
1.29   Small-Scale Credit. Four Albanian staff were recruited and have received preliminary on-the-job&#13;
training in credit and small business promotion. Their first tasks have been to: identify the target&#13;
population; assess its needs in terms of credit; and carry out preliminary market studies. Contacts have&#13;
been made with credit clients by posting announcements and through the assistance of municipality offices&#13;
responsible for paying unemployment benefits and economic assistance. Under the pre-pilot phase so far,&#13;
62 loans have been approved at an average of US$1,900 per loan, ranging from US$600 to US$3,000.&#13;
The activities being financed include a small pharmacy, small-scale production, transport, and ice-cream&#13;
and food shops. The rate of interest is 24 percent, in line with commercial interest rates, and loan&#13;
duration has averaged ten months. Several types of guarantees are being tested, including a community&#13;
guarantee (for the gypsy community), solidarity groups for women, notarized contracts, and character&#13;
referrals. Loans are approved by a Credit Committee, which currently comprises the Director of the&#13;
Rural Credit Department, the head of the Urban Credit team, and a bank representative.&#13;
1.30   Pre-pilot phase experience confirms that there is a high demand for small-scale credit in urban&#13;
areas. It has also allowed training of credit staff and experimentation with credit delivery mechanisms.&#13;
The first results of repayment are encouraging, although intense follow-up of borrowers has been&#13;
necessary. Except for the gypsy community, the solidarity group approach is not easy to implement&#13;
because of the weakness of social cohesion in urban areas.&#13;
1.31   Microenterprise Support. A knitting demonstration subproject, which was initiated in Shkoder&#13;
in cooperation with the municipality and a private Italian enterprise, has proved more difficult to&#13;
implement than originally expected and has provided an important experience for the development of this&#13;
kind of component. The subproject intended to train about twenty women on small knitting machines,&#13;
after which the machines would be sold to them on credit to establish a cottage industry. There was&#13;
initially considerable interest in the subproject and demand for the training slots was high; once trained,&#13;
however, the women showed extremely risk-averse behavior and reluctancy to work independently at&#13;
home. This experience highlighted the difficulties of changing previous state-sector workers, accustomed&#13;
to low-productivity and lack of initiative, into private entrepreneurs. The training, which focused only&#13;
on technical skills, did not take into account the difficult psychological transition from a low-productivity&#13;
laborer to a productivity-oriented entrepreneur. The subproject showed that a top-down approach is not&#13;
appropriate, and helped to redefine microenterprise support activities toward support for private bottom-&#13;
up initiatives.&#13;
1.32  In addition, a first identification of subsectors for microenterprise promotion was carried out,&#13;
focusing on wood processing in Tirana, kilim production in Kavaje, apparel in Berat, and handicrafts in&#13;
Shkoder. Production of bricks and tiles initiated by a small group of landless farmers near Shkoder has&#13;
received some credit and technical support.&#13;
1.33   Linking Rural and Urban Programs. One of most important features of the transition period&#13;
is that the state-organized marketing network has broken down and a new marketing network has not yet&#13;
emerged. A sectoral approach is not sufficient to recreate the imbricated linkages that make an economy&#13;
work. Linking rural and urban programs may help in organizing private sector supply and marketing in&#13;
both rural and urban areas.&#13;
1.34   A Common Institution: the Albanian Development Fund. The pre-pilot phase of the Urban&#13;
Works and Microenterprise Pilot Program is being carried out by the Albanian Development Fund, an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
autonomous agency created by Government decree to execute the RPAPP. Using the same agency for&#13;
the Urban Works and Microenterprise Program will: (a) allow for better communication of experience&#13;
and better coordination between the two programs; and (b) reduce  overhead costs as regards&#13;
administration, financial management, monitoring, studies, and microenterprise support (para. 3.1).&#13;
G. Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
1.35   The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy for Albania discussed by the Board&#13;
in August 1993, which called for "a flexible strategy that responds quickly to new information while&#13;
maintaining an overall framework that promotes (i) stability; and (ii) new entrepreneurship and private&#13;
initiative." The project's small-scale credit and microenterprise support components would assist in&#13;
developing new entrepreneurship and private initiative, while the urban works component would enhance&#13;
stability by providing immediate and visible results. The project's approach is flexible, allowing&#13;
components to be adapted to Albania's changing environment during the transition period.&#13;
1.36   The project would complement on-going IDA-financed projects in Albania. It would provide an&#13;
urban counterpart to the Rural Development Project, which became effective on May 23, 1995, and&#13;
linkages could be established between the two projects. The project addresses the need for rapid&#13;
intervention during Albania's transition to a market-based economy, compatible with short-term macro&#13;
stabilization. Main IDA-supported projects address structural change at the national level (such as ASAC,&#13;
the Social Safety Net Development Project, and the Labor Market Development Project) or major&#13;
infrastructure needs (such as the Housing Project and the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project). The proposed&#13;
Urban Works and Microenterprise Program would provide an interim approach for dealing with a serious&#13;
employment and poverty problem in the urban areas by providing immediate and visible results, while&#13;
providing time for longer-term, sustainable measures to take root.&#13;
&#13;

CHAPTER II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
2.1    The proposed five-year Urban Works and Microenterprise Program would have the following&#13;
main objectives:&#13;
*  to create both immediate and long-term employment in urban areas through public works&#13;
and by assisting private-sector development;&#13;
*  to repair basic urban infrastructure, which would improve the quality of urban life and&#13;
help provide the infrastructure necessary for a market economy;&#13;
*  to assist in the development of microenterprises by providing small-scale credit and&#13;
technical and business advice; and&#13;
*  to assist local governments obtain local development skills through training.&#13;
2.2    The objectives of the pilot project are to set up an appropriate implementation framework and test&#13;
approaches to the implementation of the program during its first two years.&#13;
B. Pilot Project Description&#13;
2.3   To support the above objectives, the pilot project would finance the following components:&#13;
(a) Urban works. Organize approximately 30 public works that would rehabilitate small&#13;
infrastructure, create needed market facilities, or address small environmental problems.&#13;
(b) Small-scale credit and microenterprise support. Disburse approximately 2,000 small loans&#13;
(US$300-5,000), testing sustainable methods of providing small credit to potential&#13;
microentrepreneurs. Provide technical and business advice to microentrepreneurs, and test&#13;
about five small microenterprise demonstration projects initiated by private entrepreneurs in&#13;
key subsectors to transfer know-how, technology, and new methods of supply and marketing;&#13;
(d) Studies and training. Studies would be undertaken to evaluate project impact. Training and&#13;
study tours would be used to help local governments obtain the skills needed for promoting&#13;
long-term local development.&#13;
(e) Support the necessary implementation framework for the proposed five-year program by&#13;
financing the project-related operating costs of the Albanian Development Fund (ADF), and&#13;
strengthening ADF finance and administration.&#13;
2.4   Pilot Project Area. Project activities would be focused in eight municipalities: Berat, Elbasan,&#13;
Gramsh, Kavaje, Peqin, Shijak (Durres District), Shkoder, and Tirana (see map). Pilot municipalities,&#13;
which must be accessible from Tirana to permit efficient use of pilot project resources, have been selected&#13;
taking into consideration variety (of size and region), microenterprise development potential, and&#13;
unemployment and economic assistance per capita.  Urban works would be focused in six&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
municipalities-Berat, Elbasan, Gramsh, Kavaje, Peqin, and Shkoder-although works may also be&#13;
undertaken in smaller towns located in the same districts. The small-scale credit and microenterprise&#13;
support component would focus its activities in Berat, Kavaje, Shijak, Shkoder, and Tirana.&#13;
C. Detailed Features&#13;
COMPONENT 1: URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE PUBLIC WORKS (BASE CosT US$1.7 MILLION-41 PERCENT)&#13;
2.5    The pilot project would finance about 30 public works, to be carried out in six municipalities.&#13;
Works would be demand driven, presented for ADF evaluation and approval by municipality authorities&#13;
according to the needs of the local population and within a framework of criteria defined by the project&#13;
(see Annex D, para. 5-9). Subprojects, which would only involve infrastructure under the responsibility&#13;
of the municipality, could include, for example, rehabilitating market facilities, cleaning city waterways,&#13;
rehabilitating public buildings (such as schools and hospitals), repairing municipality roads and sidewalks,&#13;
preparing sites and services for squatter settlements, planting trees and urban landscaping, and&#13;
constructing garbage shelters. Works would be carried out by private contractors selected by&#13;
municipalities using national shopping, with the assistance and oversight of the ADF. A few types of&#13;
works that require mainly manual labor (such as grading or cleaning riverbanks) could be undertaken by&#13;
municipalities, which would directly hire unemployed or disadvantaged workers. Subproject cost would&#13;
range from US$10,000 to US$150,000, and is expected to average US$48,000 during PYI and&#13;
US$63,000 in PY2. The expected cost breakdown of urban works is shown in Annex D, Table D.4.&#13;
2.6    Current central budget transfers to municipalities for investment is minimal, and while&#13;
municipalities now have the ability to raise local revenues through certain taxes, these revenues are likely&#13;
to remain very small for the next few years. Accordingly, the urban works component would provide&#13;
municipalities with urgently needed investment funds for the transition period, allowing time for more&#13;
suitable financing systems to be put into place. It would also help prepare municipality governments for&#13;
their future responsibility for local development. As soon as municipalities have adequate investment&#13;
budgets, they could be asked to contribute a part (5-10 percent) of subproject investment cost.&#13;
2.7   Special consideration would be granted to assuring maintenance of rehabilitated infrastructure&#13;
When appropriate, user associations would be formed and maintenance funds established prior to the&#13;
investment, drawing upon the experience of the Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project. (Maintenance&#13;
is further discussed in Annex D, para. 20-22.)&#13;
COMPONENT 2: SMALL-SCALE CREDIT AND MICROENTERPRISE SUPPORT (BASE CoSn US$1.8&#13;
MILLION-43 PERCENT)&#13;
2.8   The pilot project would develop and test urban microenterprise lending, building a credit delivery&#13;
system that combines poverty alleviation with economic growth on a progressively sustainable basis.&#13;
During the project period, about 2,000 small loans would be granted in five municipalities for income-&#13;
generating activity, assisting potential microentrepreneurs who are unemployed or receiving economic&#13;
assistance and who have difficulty in accessing banks. Potential microbusiness activities to be financed&#13;
include: small trade, small businesses (pharmacies, bakeries), services (repairing of television sets,&#13;
bicycles, etc.), artisanal production of all types (soap, candles, furniture, sweets, tailoring, shoe making),&#13;
and basic construction and rehabilitation. Special attention would be given to opportunities for women.&#13;
Loans, which would be denominated in leks and would normally range from US$300 to US$5,000&#13;
equivalent, are expected to average about US$2,000, and interest would be in line with commercial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
rates.'2 It was agreed during negotiations that the maximum subloan size for the small credit program&#13;
would be US$5,000 in the Operational Guidelines, but that a higher limit of US$10,000 would be&#13;
established In the legal agreements in order to allow for flexibility in the future in the event of special&#13;
circumstances of changed conditions. Loan duration which would depend on the activity financed, would&#13;
be expected to average nine months. (Credit delivery mechanisms are discussed in Annex E, paras. 52-&#13;
59, and credit program repayment scenarios are shown in Table E.3.).&#13;
2.9    A variety of guarantee mechanisms would be tested, including solidarity groups, notarized&#13;
contracts (currently practiced for some types of informal lending), and character referrals. Loans would&#13;
be approved by a Credit Committee, comprised of the Director of the ADF Rural Credit Department,&#13;
the Director of the ADF Urban Credit Department, and a bank representative, who would meet regularly&#13;
to discuss loans for approval or rescheduling and to continuously define and improve methods and&#13;
procedures. Individual applications would be presented and defended by the Credit Officer responsible&#13;
for loan preparation and follow-up. The composition of the Credit Committee would be dynamic and&#13;
subject to change as the component evolves, and could eventually include borrower representatives.&#13;
2.10   Business and technical advice would be made available to microentrepreneurs by the credit team,&#13;
with the possible support of local consultants remunerated on a per-service basis. In addition, a small&#13;
"innovation fund" would be established to help private entrepreneurs create about five model&#13;
microenterprises in key subsectors, such as textiles, wood processing, metal processing, and carpet&#13;
production. These demonstration projects, which could include loans with grant elements to private&#13;
entrepreneurs, would transfer small technology and new forms of supply, production, and marketing.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that each microenterprise subproject to be supported under the&#13;
'innovation fund' would be submitted to IDA for prior approval, and that individual loans under the&#13;
'innovation fund' would not exceed US$15,000.  Other support actions to be financed under the&#13;
component are training, market and technical studies, and a microenterprise data base and information&#13;
center.&#13;
CoMPoNENT 3: STUDIES AND TRAINING (BASE COST US$0.1 MILLION-3 PERCENT)&#13;
2.11   Municipalities are unprepared to address basic urban infrastructure needs, much less to develop&#13;
the innovative programs needed for long-run economic development. Assistance and training would be&#13;
provided to municipalities to develop skills in local development, and the project would provide seed&#13;
money to initiate professional exchanges that would provide rapid exposure to local development practices&#13;
that have proven successful elsewhere. Also, beneficiary assessment studies would be funded under this&#13;
component to evaluate project impact.&#13;
COMPONENT 4: IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT (BASE COST US$ 0.6 MILLION-13 PERCENT)&#13;
2.12   The pilot project would support program implementation by financing the project-related operating&#13;
costs of the Albanian Development Fund (ADF). The ADF is also the implementing agency for the&#13;
RPAPP and the follow-up Rural Development Project (para. 3.1). Operational procedures and&#13;
mechanisms of technical and financial control for the project would be developed during the pilot phase.&#13;
12/    Under thc pro-pilot phuse, the interest rste is 24 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
2.13   Given the project's pilot and experimental nature and the need to test and develop component&#13;
methodology and to train staff, significant technical assistance would be required. A large part of the&#13;
technical assistance would be shared with the on-going Rural Development Project, thereby reducing&#13;
project costs and helping to assure linkages and communication of experience between the two projects.&#13;
Pilot project components include 20 months of foreign technical assistance in the areas of urban&#13;
works/engineering (3 person months), small credit/microenterprise (8 pm), and management/finance (6&#13;
pm). The project would also finance technical and marketing studies for microenterprises (about 3 pm)&#13;
and project auditing. In all, foreign technical assistance amounts to US$398,000 (10 percent of base&#13;
costs). Consultant trust funds and other grant financing would be sought to finance as much technical&#13;
assistance as possible. Local technical assistance consists of 165 months for microenterprise advisory&#13;
services and project impact studies.&#13;
D. Pilot Project Cost and Financing&#13;
2.14   Total Project Cost.  The pilot project would cost a total of US$4.4 million, including&#13;
contingencies. The foreign exchange component of the pilot project is estimated at US$1.0 million, or&#13;
about 22 percent of total pilot project costs. The estimated pilot project costs are summarized in Tables&#13;
2.1 and 2.2 below. Summary and detailed costs are provided in Annex B.&#13;
2.15   Cost Estimates. Pilot project local costs are expressed in US dollars at the exchange rate&#13;
prevailing in early 1995. No price contingencies have been applied to public works, credit, or the&#13;
microenterprise "innovation fund" because they reflect programs without precise, predetermined unit&#13;
costs; any increase in costs would result in a reduction in the scope of the program. Physical&#13;
contingencies of 5 percent have been applied to all categories except credit. Price contingencies have&#13;
been calculated based on 2.2 percent for foreign exchange, and local inflation of 15 percent in PY1 and&#13;
PY2 and 10 percent in PY3. Price contingencies for local salaries are based on inflation of 20 percent&#13;
in PYI, PY2, and PY3.&#13;

2.16    Project Financing. Of the total project cost of US$4.4 million, the proposed IDA  credit will&#13;
finance US$4 million (91 percent of total costs), and the Government would finance US$400,000 (9&#13;
percent of total costs), which is sufficient to cover estimated taxes and import duties. The financing plan&#13;
is shown in Table 2.3.&#13;

E. Environmental Impact&#13;
2.17  In accordance with Operational Directive 4.01, the project was assigned environmental screening&#13;
category "B." The small scale of project activities makes any negative environmental impact unlikely.&#13;
Some public works, such as rehabilitating small sanitation networks or cleaning riverbanks and urban&#13;
waterways, could have a positive environmental impact.&#13;
2.18   During the Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project, environmental guidelines and checklists were&#13;
developed for rural works. Although the checklists were for a time not completed, they are now being&#13;
used and are helping to increase the environmental awareness of local government officials. These&#13;
guidelines and checklists would be adapted and expanded for urban infrastructure subprojects.&#13;

CHAPTER III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.1    Elements of the Project Implementation Plan are covered in Chapters II and Im of this SAR and&#13;
in Annexes D and E. Key actions and dates for start-up and implementation are provided in Annex F.&#13;
A. Project Management&#13;
3.2   Implementing Agency. The on-going Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project is implemented by&#13;
the Albanian Development Fund (ADF), which was established by Government as the successor to the&#13;
Rural Development Fund. The text of the decree establishing ADF is shown in Annex C (Government&#13;
Decision 427, September 8, 1994). The ADF is a juridical person with the authority to enter into&#13;
contracts, and with administrative, technical and financial autonomy. Defining and overseeing ADF main&#13;
policy and objectives is a Board of Trustees chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister and comprised of the&#13;
Minister of Agriculture and Food, Minister of Labor, Minister of Construction, Local Government&#13;
Secretary, and Director of the Department of Economic Development and Foreign Aid Coordination.&#13;
An Executive Committee, formed by the ADF Executive Director (named by the Board Chairman), the&#13;
Operational Department Directors, and the Finance Director, is responsible for ADF's day-to-day&#13;
management.&#13;
3.3   In order assure that clear arrangements are in place for the transfer of IDA funds from the credit&#13;
account to the ADF, assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Government would conclude, prior&#13;
to effectiveness, a subsidiary agreement acceptable to IDA under which it would pass the proceeds of the&#13;
Credit to the project implementing agency, the ADF, as a grant.&#13;
3.4   Internal ADF Organization. ADF implementation of the rural and urban projects would lead&#13;
to efficiency and economy. A reorganization of the ADF-which takes into consideration experience&#13;
under the urban pre-pilot phase-is currently underway to accommodate the increase and diversification&#13;
of ADF activity. The ADF will comprise three departments, each headed by a Deputy Director:&#13;
(a) Administration and Monitoring Department, with three divisions: Financial Division; Human&#13;
Resources Division; and Monitoring and Studies Division.&#13;
(b) Infrastructure Department, with two divisions: Rural works; and Urban works.&#13;
(c) Credit Department, with three divisions: Rural Credit; Promotion of Rural Activities&#13;
(veterinary support); and Urban Credit and Microenterprise Support.&#13;
Within the ADF, the rural and urban projects would share the financial and administrative management&#13;
(which would be strengthened by technical assistance and training) and monitoring and evaluation (the&#13;
same methods would be used for both the rural and urban projects). The rural and urban credit division&#13;
and the rural and urban infrastructure division would share the same leadership, but would operate&#13;
separately, because the projects are at different stages of development, the approaches for rural and urban&#13;
works are different, and the future institutional setting for the rural and urban credit programs may be&#13;
different.&#13;
3.5   Staff. Most high-level staff positions are already filled; new high-level positions would be mainly&#13;
filled by way of internal promotion, using professionals who have demonstrated their capabilities. In&#13;
order to assure strong and competent project management, assurances were obtained at negotiations that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
ADF would employ, until project completion, an executive director whose experience and qualifications&#13;
would be at all times acceptable to IDA; and ADF would consult with IDA with respect to the replacement&#13;
of the executive director prior to any such replacement. A consultant would assist the Executive Director&#13;
in the transformation and organization of the new institutional structure. Also, a position of Assistant&#13;
to the Executive Director would be established to help with internal communication and coordination.&#13;
3.6    Operational Guidelines. The ADF's operations are governed by its Internal Regulations and&#13;
Manual of Procedures, both of which are updated periodically and approved by the Board of Trustees.&#13;
Similar regulations and operational guidelines would be developed to guide activities under the proposed&#13;
project. In order to ensure consistent and optimal use of project resources in line with project objectives,&#13;
assurances were obtained at negotiations that the ADF would undertake project activities in accordance&#13;
with Operational Guidelines acceptable to IDA, and any subsequent changes to these guidelines would&#13;
only be made in consultation with, and with the approval of, IDA. ADF approval of the Operational&#13;
Guidelines in form and substance satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of project effectiveness.&#13;
3.7    Annual Works Plans and Budgets.  Annual works plans and budgets for each project&#13;
component, which would include specific proposals for the use of Government's contribution, would be&#13;
prepared by the ADF, and assurances were obtained at negotiations that such work plans and budgets&#13;
would be submitted to IDA for review no later than November 30 of each year. In accordance with the&#13;
process approach adopted by the project, work plans would reflect project experience in the proceeding&#13;
period. Budgets, which would be based on appraisal estimates, would be amended where necessary to&#13;
reflect changes in costs and development policies. Annual budgets would include specific proposals for&#13;
the use of the Government's financial contribution.&#13;
B. Procurement&#13;
3.8   The project elements, estimated costs, and procurement arrangements are summarized in&#13;
Table 3. 1.&#13;
3.9   The Albanian Development Fund, the successor to the Rural Development Fund, would be&#13;
responsible for overall procurement activities. ADF staff implemented the Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot&#13;
Project and have experience in procurement; to strengthen their procurement knowledge, key staff dealing&#13;
with procurement would attend a World Bank procurement seminar scheduled to be held in Tirana in the&#13;
second half of 1995. Given the small value and dispersed location of contracts to be financed,&#13;
international competitive bidding is not considered suitable. Procurement for items financed by the IDA&#13;
credit would be carried out as follows:&#13;
3.10   Civil Works. Works contracts under the project consist of demand-driven public works (costing&#13;
from US$10,000-US$150,000) in about six municipalities. Most works would be carried out by private&#13;
contractors, selected by municipalities using national shopping (NS) and with the assistance of the ADF,&#13;
for an estimated aggregate amount of US$1,141,000. In a few cases, when the works involve mainly&#13;
labor, the works would be carried out directly by the municipalities, which would hire local workers&#13;
using community participation procedures, which are presently used under the RPAPP and are acceptable&#13;
to IDA, for an estimated aggregate amount of US$285,000. During project negotiations, it was agreed&#13;
that all urban works, other than community participation works, would be procured through NS using&#13;
the Bank's simplified national competitive (NCB) bidding documents for small works below US$250,000&#13;
prepared for Albania for this purpose and recommended to the Bank borrowers (available on diskette in&#13;
Albanian and English). It was further agreed that the ADF may review and revise the simplified NCB&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
documents, but the ADF must prepare a draft for the Bank's review and approval prior to its use.&#13;
Individual subprojects expected to average US$48,000 in project year I and US$63,000 in project year&#13;
2 and are not expected to exceed US$150,000.&#13;
3.11   Credit. Procurement under revolving credit funds, which would involve very small ainounts&#13;
(US$300-15,000), typically for purchase of minor equipment, tools, or materials, would be organized by&#13;
the borrowers in accordance with their traditional purchasing practices, which are based on obtaining&#13;
sound price quotations from local suppliers and which are acceptable to IDA, for an aggregate amount&#13;
of US$1,521,000.&#13;
3.12   Consulting Services, Training, Study Tours. Consultants for technical assistance financed&#13;
under the project would be selected in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981). Technical&#13;
assistance (aggregate US$447,000) would consist of specialized urban works/engineering, small&#13;
credit/microenterprise, management/finance, and auditing, involving consulting firms and individual&#13;
experts. Technical assistance would total about 24 months, consisting of one long-term consultancy (12&#13;
months) shared with the Rural Development Project, and four consultancies of 3-8 months each during&#13;
the two-year implementation period. Because the services are in unrelated fields of expertise, it is not&#13;
foreseen that contracts would be grouped into packages. In addition, about US$156,000 aggregate for&#13;
training and study tours may be procured from consulting firms or specialized institutions.&#13;
3.13   Equipment and Materials. Contracts for equipment and materials (e.g. office and computer&#13;
equipment, vehicles, and small microenterprise equipment), for an aggregate amount estimated at&#13;
US$104,000, would be awarded through international shopping procedures based on comparing quotes&#13;
from at least three suppliers from three eligible countries. It is expected that individual contracts for the&#13;
purchase of equipment would not exceed US$60,000. National shopping procedures would be used for&#13;
minor equipment and supplies to be procured locally for an aggregate amount estimated at US$28,000.&#13;
Individual contracts for national shopping are not expected to exceed US$20,000. Copyrighted materials&#13;
or specialized microenterprise equipment, for an aggregate amount of US$19,000) would be procured&#13;
through direct purchase from suppliers.&#13;
3.14  Incremental Operating Costs.  The credit would finance incremental operating costs of&#13;
US$300,000 consisting of the salaries and operating costs of ADF incurred to implement the project (see&#13;
para. 3.19).&#13;

The remaining contracts would be subject to selective post-award reviews by IDA.&#13;
3.16 Procurement Information to be Provided by the Borrower. The ADF would promptly inform&#13;
IDA of contract awards and procurement issues and would include the-following procurement information&#13;
in its quarterly progress reports:&#13;
(a) for equipment/materials, technical assistance, and training, and study tours: status and timing&#13;
of all pending actions; and&#13;
(b) status of aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.&#13;
C. Disbursements&#13;
3.17   The proposed IDA credit of US$4 million would be disbursed over four fiscal years (36 months).&#13;
The proposed closing date for the credit would be June 30, 1999. Estimated IDA disbursements are&#13;
shown in Table 3.2.&#13;

documentation of expenditures for individual contracts for equipment, technical assistance, and training&#13;
above US$50,000 equivalent, and for civil works above US$150,000. Disbursements for credit and&#13;
recurrent costs, for individual contracts below US$50,000 (equipment, technical assistance, training), and&#13;
for individual contracts below US$150,000 (civil works) would be made on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditure certified by the ADF Executive Director. The required supporting documents would be&#13;
retained by the ADF for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in&#13;
which the last disbursement was made. This documentation would be made available for review by the&#13;
auditors and by visiting IDA staff upon request.&#13;

3.19   Incremental operating costs, which would consist of operation and maintenance costs that would&#13;
not be incurred without the project, would include: (a) maintenance and operation or rental of equipment&#13;
procured or used under the project; (b) salaries and per diems paid to ADF staff hired under the project;&#13;
(c) consumable office supplies; and (d) office rent and maintenance, utilities, and telecommunications&#13;
pertaining to the project.&#13;
3.20   Special Account.  To facilitate timely project implementation, the ADF would establish,&#13;
maintain, and operate, under conditions acceptable to IDA, a Special Account denominated in US dollars&#13;
in the Bank of Albania. During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation of the Special Account&#13;
would be limited to US$250,000. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the credit have&#13;
reached the level of SDR 500,000 (about US$790,000), the initial allocation may be increased up to the&#13;
authorized allocation of US$500,000 be submitting the relevant application for withdrawal.&#13;
Replenishment must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting&#13;
documents.&#13;
D. Supervision, Monitoring, and Reporting&#13;
3.21    Supervision. Given its pilot and experimental nature, the project would require intense follow&#13;
up and IDA supervision. IDA would undertake regular supervision missions, including field visits and&#13;
spot checks of a sample of subprojects. The supervision plan in Annex F (Table F.2) provides details&#13;
on the planned supervision inputs for the project. A project launch mission in late September 1995 would&#13;
carefully review the status of the Operational Guidelines, the approval of which is a condition of&#13;
effectiveness (para. 3.6). Also, the project launch mission would conduct with ADF a workshop in order&#13;
to strengthen and review the procedures for procurement, monitoring, reporting, and work plans and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
budgets. Subsequently, four IDA missions per calendar year, in coordination with missions for the Rural&#13;
Development Project and the IFAD-financed Northeastern Districts Rural Development Project, which&#13;
are also implemented by the ADF, would be conducted in 1996 (including a mid-term review in&#13;
September 1996) and 1997. Missions undertaken during the fall would discuss and evaluate with ADF&#13;
the annual work plans and budgets for the following fiscal year.&#13;
3.22   Monitoring. Project monitoring, which would gauge progress during implementation as well as&#13;
assess the results of the pilot phase, would be coordinated by -he ADF Studies Department. A&#13;
management information system would be implemented during the project for this purpose. The Studies&#13;
Department would also undertake a project impact (beneficiary assessment) study. The Studies&#13;
Department has gained considerable experience that would assist in project monitoring and evaluation-it&#13;
coordinated a project impact study of the Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project in April and May 1994&#13;
and the Department Chief has received training in project evaluation techniques.&#13;
3.23   Quarterly Reports/Performance Indicators. In order to assure timely reporting to IDA as well&#13;
as to ADF management and Board of Trustees, assurances were obtained at negotiations that ADF would&#13;
submit to IDA for review quarterly reports on the progress and execution of the project in a format&#13;
acceptable to IDA. Quarterly reports would include the following performance indicators by district and&#13;
sector:&#13;
(a) Public Works:&#13;
Number of subprojects under consideration, underway, and completed&#13;
List of subprojects by location (municipality)&#13;
List of subprojects by type, including average cost by type&#13;
List of type of maintenance arrangement established for each subproject&#13;
Number of workdays created, total and by municipality&#13;
Number of beneficiaries, total and by municipality&#13;
Percentage of labor in the subproject investment cost, total and by type of subproject&#13;
Amount aek and US$) disbursed and committed, total and by municipality&#13;
(b) Credit and Microenterprise Support:&#13;
Number of subloans distributed, total and by municipality&#13;
Total number of applications; percent of applications approved for each municipality&#13;
Type of activities financed (percentage breakdown)&#13;
Number and type of jobs created, transaction costs per job creation&#13;
Repayment rate; number of subloans entirely repaid, number of subloans in the process of&#13;
repayment, number of subloans in default (less that 3 months); number of subloans in default&#13;
(more than 3 months)&#13;

procurement; and&#13;
(f) ADF:&#13;
Names and titles of key personnel, indicating any changes that have taken place during the&#13;
reporting period&#13;
Quarterly and cumulative operating costs by department and category.&#13;
3.24   Accounts and Audits. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the ADF would maintain&#13;
accounting procedures acceptable to IDA, and that independent auditors, acceptable to IDA, would&#13;
undertake annual audits of the ADF. Not later than six months after the end of the financial year, ADF&#13;
would submit to IDA certified copies of the audit reports containing balance sheets, income statements,&#13;
and the auditor's opinion on whether the ADF is achieving its objectives in a cost-effective way and&#13;
whether internal controls are adequate to minimize the possibility of misuse of funds.&#13;
3.25   A separate cost-accounting system would be developed under the project for the credit program&#13;
in order to produce separate balance sheets and income statements, which would also be presented in&#13;
accordance with OD 8.30. Once such a system is in place, ADF would calculate the Subsidy Dependency&#13;
Index for the credit program.'3&#13;
3.26   Mid-Term Review. For the purpose of adjusting pilot project activities and for designing the&#13;
full-scale project, assurances were obtained at negotiations that ADF would undertake a mid-term&#13;
evaluation of the pilot project no later than September 30, 1996. IDA would participate in this mid-term&#13;
review.&#13;

CHAPTER IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
4.1     Given the pilot nature of this project, the type of the investments proposed and the project design,&#13;
a conventional economic analysis is not meaningful. However, a methodology to confirm efficient use&#13;
of funds would be tested during the pilot project. In the meantime, urban works will be selected on basis&#13;
of criteria designed to meet priority needs of communities. Subloans for microentrepreneurs will be&#13;
required to have viable financial cashtlows with market interest rates (currently 20%). The project's&#13;
impact-both direct benefits and long-term benefits-can be estimated for each component as shown in&#13;
Table 4.1.&#13;
4.2     Overall, the pilot project would provide immediate and visible results in the project area. It&#13;
would assist unemployed urban inhabitants to become economically active and to cut their dependency&#13;
on economic assistance programs. It would provide municipalities with hands-on training in local&#13;
development, helping them to assume their current responsibilities as well as preparing them for the&#13;
future. And it would assist the Government in testing pro-active employment generation and poverty&#13;
alleviation programs that could be replicable throughout cities in Albania.&#13;
TABLE 4.1: PROJECT IMMEDIATE AND LONG-TERM BENEFITS&#13;
Direct and Immediate Benefits                      Long-Term  Benefits&#13;

B. Risks&#13;
4.3     The risk that urban works would be ill chosen or that local implementation capacity is weak is&#13;
not believed to be significant given the highly positive rural works experience under the RPAPP and&#13;
experience under the pre-pilot phase of the urban program. There is a risk of non-repayment of loans&#13;
and/or high transaction costs under the small-scale credit component; the development of an appropriate&#13;
mechanism for credit delivery would be critical to the component's success, and transaction costs should&#13;
be compared to the social and financial costs of unemployment. Careful follow-up monitoring of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
credit program would be undertaken to mitigate design and repayment risks. While it is considered that&#13;
a basic legal framework exists for small-scale enterprise development, it should be ensured that the legal&#13;
framework remains conducive for small private sector development. Project-specific risk should be&#13;
minimized because the project would be built with the full participation of local authorities and the&#13;
beneficiaries themselves. Moreover, the process approach provides for continuous adjustment of the&#13;
program in accordance with local needs and constraints, as long as project feedback is effectively&#13;
incorporated. Management and political risk would be minimized by giving special attention to project&#13;
management and organization as well as to written operational guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
CHAPTIER V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
5.1    During negotiations, the following assurances were obtained from Government and ADF:&#13;
(a)    ADF would employ, until project completion, an executive director whose experience and&#13;
qualifications would be at all times acceptable to IDA, and would consult with IDA with&#13;
respect to the replacement of the executive director prior to any such replacement; (para.&#13;
3.4);&#13;
(b)    ADF would undertake project activities in accordance with Operational Guidelines&#13;
acceptable to IDA, and any changes to the Operational Guidelines would only be made&#13;
in consultation with, and with the approval of, IDA (para. 3.6);&#13;
(c)    By November 30 of each year, ADF would prepare and submit to IDA for review work&#13;
plans and budgets for project activities, which would include specific proposals for the&#13;
use of Government's contribution (para 3.7);&#13;
(d)    ADF would submit to IDA for prior review each microenterprise subproject to be&#13;
supported under the "innovation fund" (para. 2.10);&#13;
(e)    ADF would take all measures to ensure that individual subloans under the small credit&#13;
program would not exceed US$10,000, and that individual subloans under the&#13;
"innovation fund" would not exceed US$15,000 (paras. 2.8 and 2.10);&#13;
(f)    ADF would submit to IDA quarterly reports, by April 15, July 15, October 15, and&#13;
January 15 of each year, on the progress and execution of the project in a format&#13;
acceptable to IDA (para. 3.23);&#13;
(g)    ADF would maintain accounting practices acceptable to IDA and independent auditors,&#13;
acceptable to IDA, would undertake annual audits of the Albanian Development Fund&#13;
(para. 3.24); and&#13;
(h)    ADF would undertake a mid-term evaluation of the pilot project no later than September&#13;
30, 1996 (para. 3.26).&#13;
5.2    Conditions of effectiveness would be:&#13;
(a)    Execution of a subsidiary agreement between the Ministry of Finance and ADF under&#13;
which the Government would make the Credit proceeds available to ADF on a grant basis&#13;
(para. 3.2); and&#13;
(b)    Operational Guidelines have been approved by the Board of Trustees of the Albanian&#13;
Development Fund in form and substance satisfactory to IDA (para. 3.6).&#13;
5.3   Subject to the above agreements and conditions, the proposed project would be suitable for an&#13;
IDA credit of SDR 2.6 million (US$4.0 million equivalent) at standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity.&#13;

ALBANIA&#13;
URBAN WORKS AND MICROENTERPRISE PILOT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX D&#13;
URBAN WORKS COMPONENT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
Urban Infrastructure&#13;
1.    Most of Albania's infrastructure is in extremely poor condition. Under centralized planning,&#13;
techniques used were often obsolete, and construction was based almost entirely on technical-rather than&#13;
economic-criteria, leading to exorbitant operating and maintenance costs.  Moreover, political&#13;
considerations sometimes resulted in an emphasis on quantity at the expense of quality, and lack of&#13;
budgetary resources and absence of motivation led to poor quality work.&#13;
2.    While urban infrastructure is better than rural infrastructure, its condition is still deplorable. For&#13;
example:&#13;
(a) water reservoirs are in poor shape and interruptions in the water supply occur frequently;&#13;
(b) sewerage reserves are insufficient and often do not include purification facilities;&#13;
(c) even though Albania has an excess of electrical capacity, the poor quality distribution&#13;
network results in frequent blackouts;&#13;
(d) public buildings (offices, schools, clinics, markets) are not maintained and are increasingly&#13;
dilapidated.&#13;
3.    In addition to this already difficult situation, Albanian towns are now confronted with substantial&#13;
rural-to-urban migration which had been tightly controlled by the Government for more than forty years,&#13;
leading to an unsustainable rural population. Despite the Government's current efforts to discourage&#13;
migration, squatter settlements have formed in almost every large town.&#13;
4.    Municipalities have few resources with which to address the problems outlined above. Many&#13;
legal issues remain to be resolved regarding urban land ownership in towns and in former state farms.&#13;
Furthermore, there is an extreme shortage of funds for both long-term investment and short-term&#13;
operations, making it impossible to meet existing needs. No municipal budgets have yet been allocated&#13;
for 1994, for example, and only ad hoc monthly injections of short-term funds prevent municipalities&#13;
from defaulting on salary payments to their employees.&#13;
II. URBAN WORKS PRIORITIES&#13;
5.    Municipal Priorities. Informal surveys that were carried out in a number of towns identified&#13;
the following requests of the municipalities for urban infrastructure:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX D                                                     - 48 -&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
(i)  first priority: supply and distribution of water and power;&#13;
(ii) second priority:  repair and maintenance of basic infrastructure such as roads, garbage&#13;
storage and sewerage systems, public buildings (such as schools and clinics), markets, and&#13;
waterways; and&#13;
(iii)  third priority: sanitation systems and bus stations.&#13;
6.      Subproject Selection Criteria. Table D. 1 provides an overview of the six main criteria that&#13;
were used in determining which types of works should be carried out by the project. Of these criteria,&#13;
two are the most important:&#13;
(i) the infrastructure to be rehabilitated should fall under the direct responsibility of the&#13;
municipality. For example, the improvement of power distribution is not an issue for&#13;
which the municipality is directly responsible as it covers a larger area of the district or&#13;
country as a whole;&#13;
(ii) the average amount budgeted for each subproject will be US$40,000-60,000. Within this&#13;
amount, the subproject should be self-contained and make a significant impact. This would&#13;
be the case for the rehabilitation of a school, but not for the resurfacing of a few hundred&#13;
meters of road.&#13;

7.     First Priority. According to the preceding table, four types of subprojects emerge as the most&#13;
favorable in terms of their convergence with both municipal and project priorities:&#13;
(i) Rehabilitation of markets;&#13;
(ii) Rehabilitation of public buildings, such as schools and health centers;&#13;
(iii) Rehabilitation of sanitation networks' by undertaking small, key repairs that strengthen the&#13;
existing network and address immediate problems; and&#13;
(iv) Caeaning and improving riverbanks and city waterways?. (In addition to its positive effect&#13;
on the environment and the stabilization of the land, this type of activity is very labor&#13;
intensive.)&#13;
8.     Second Priority.  The following operations fall into the second priority category:&#13;
(i) Bus station construction or rehabilitation, including a parking and back-up area and a small&#13;
market adjacent to the bus stop.&#13;
(ii) Rehabilitation of workshops for small-scale artisans in order to promote the still-young&#13;
microenterprise sector. This type of operations would be undertaken in close cooperation&#13;
with the project's Microenterprise Support component.&#13;
(iii) Preparation of sites and services (rehabilitating plots and hooking them up to sewerage and&#13;
water supply) would help municipalities address migration from rural areas. Squatter&#13;
settlements, which are forming around urban centers, are in need of basic infrastructure,&#13;
yet municipalities cannot provide for these new arrivals until land ownership is clarified.&#13;
Some pilot operations in sites and services could be tested where land ownership is clearly&#13;
established.&#13;
(iv) Rehabilitation of urban roads, although very important for the municipalities, is a&#13;
secondary priority for the project; given the foreseen budget range for subprojects and the&#13;
high unit costs for road rehabilitation, a road subproject would have only a marginal impact&#13;
on a town's infrastructure.&#13;
9.     Non-Priority Works.&#13;
(i) Treatment of household waste-garbage collection, transport, and storage- is the&#13;
responsibility of the municipalities. Given the current state of Albania's waste disposal&#13;
system, there is an enormous amount of work to be done in the first stages of the disposal&#13;
chain, requiring containers, manual labor, and transport, but not urban works. However,&#13;
operations could be envisaged on a case-by-case basis for fencing as well as access to and&#13;
preparation of intermediary storage sites.&#13;
(ii) Drinking water supply is not a direct responsibility of the municipalities and, as for roads,&#13;
the required size and cost of the project are too large for the scope of the component.&#13;
Despite these reservations, one could envisage the implementation of small, urgent&#13;
I/     Drainage/tewerage systems are often in extremely poor condition, posing both environmental and health hazards.&#13;
2J         Municipal canals and waterways are often used for the disposal of waste and sewerage.&#13;

measures that would have a direct impact on the community, such as the repair of a&#13;
community water reservoir.   In such a case, project staff would cooperate with&#13;
district-rather than municipal-authorities.&#13;
(iii) Electricity distribution is not a priority for the same reasons as those cited for drinking&#13;
water supply.&#13;
III. ExPERIENCE UNDER THE PRE-PILOT PHASE&#13;
10.   Following the process approach, two subprojects have been financed under the pre-pilot phase&#13;
in order to start developing the methodology for the public works component:&#13;
(a) Shkoder. As part of the first phase of central market rehabilitation, an open air fenced-in&#13;
market (1,500m2) has being built and supplied with a cement slab, sanitation, drainage,&#13;
slaughtering areas, and water. The first phase of the subproject was completed in September&#13;
1994 for a total cost of US$46,000. The second phase of the market rehabilitation-the&#13;
building of market stalls and the rehabilitation of the central market hall-is expected to start&#13;
in June 1995, partly financed by the pre-pilot phase. Partial cost recovery of the second&#13;
phase investment- using taxes collected from the market-is also being tested.&#13;
(b) Shijak (Durres district). The rehabilitation of the central market (550m) was financed for&#13;
a total amount of US$29,000. The subproject came to a halt in Fall 1994, because of a&#13;
dispute over the land. This experience has led to changes in the standard contract between&#13;
the ADF and the municipality, in order to provide additional assurances that the project site&#13;
is not eligible for reprivatization.&#13;
11.   These operations facilitated the testing of the capacity of the municipalities in selecting and&#13;
appraising projects, organizing tenders, participating in the investment (the contribution amounts to 5&#13;
percent in Shkoder but is much more difficult to obtain from small cities) and organizing the maintenance&#13;
of the project (a contribution of 3 percent per year is a precondition for financing).&#13;
12.   The operations also allowed the testing of the performance of private enterprises (that try to do&#13;
good quality work in order to be eligible for other contracts), and conditions of contracts which stipulated&#13;
that a certain percentage of labor be hired from the ranks of currently unemployed workers.&#13;
13.   Conclusion. The three main differences between the urban and rural areas are that (a) The&#13;
participation of the inhabitants in the selection of the projects is difficult to organize in urban areas. The&#13;
projects are therefore directly selected by the municipalities; (b) The subprojects financed in urban areas&#13;
represent a smaller portion of the necessary investment. Their relative direct impact is therefore more&#13;
limited than in the villages, but their training effect is quite significant; (c) The private sector is growing&#13;
rapidly in the towns and national shopping procedures, based on national competitive bidding documents&#13;
developed for small works in Albania, can be used to procure civil works, whereas in remote rural areas,&#13;
use of private contractors is just beginning. The cost of working with private construction enterprises&#13;
is about 30 percent higher; and (d) Cost recovery mechanisms can be developed for income-generating&#13;
subproject in urban areas.&#13;

IV. METHOD OF INTERVENTION&#13;
14.   Methods proposed for the pilot project are based on the experience gained under the Rural&#13;
Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project and the pre-pilot phase of the Urban Works and Microenterprise Pilot&#13;
project.&#13;
15.   Subproject Selection. Within the criteria described above, subprojects would be selected by the&#13;
municipalities, who know best their needs and who will ultimately be responsible for the infrastructure's&#13;
maintenance. A balance would be sought between the needs of the municipalities, project priorities, and&#13;
available resources. The project's Infrastructure Department staff would be responsible for conveying&#13;
the project's approach, priorities, and constraints to municipal officials.&#13;
16.   Implementation. Works financed under the Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project in isolated&#13;
rural areas mainly implemented via direct contracts with the commune, which uses national shopping for&#13;
procurement of transport and materials (typically 70 percent of subproject cost) and hires unskilled labor&#13;
from the unemployed pool available in the village. In urban areas, however, works would be undertaken&#13;
by private contractors procured via national shopping (see para. 25).&#13;
17.   Urban works differ from rural works in two important ways:&#13;
(i) Urban works are often more technical and require the involvement of a larger number of&#13;
specialists;&#13;
(ii) Private contractors are readily available in urban areas; using municipalities to directly&#13;
undertake works would compete with and impede the growth of the private sector.&#13;
18.   A few types of works that require mainly manual labor (such as grading or cleaning riverbanks)&#13;
could be directly undertaken by municipalities. It is expected, however, that 80 percent of the urban&#13;
works would be undertaken by private contractors selected through a process of competitive bidding. The&#13;
allocation of tasks would therefore be the following:&#13;
(i) The Municipality manages the competitive bidding process, signs the contracts, and&#13;
supervises-technically and financially-the implementation. In addition to performing&#13;
these tasks free of charge, municipalities could be asked to contribute a part (10 percent)&#13;
of the investment once municipality investment budgets are adequate.&#13;
(ii) The Private Enterprise (construction company) is responsible for the completion of the&#13;
actual work (in particular, the hiring and supervision of personnel) and is accountable for&#13;
the quality of the final product.&#13;
(iii) lhe Project (Albanian Development Fund Infrastructure Department) would provide&#13;
financing and would assist municipalities to supervise implementation.&#13;
19.   Cost Recovery. Whenever possible, subprojects that generate revenues of the municipalities&#13;
(such as market rehabilitation) would include a full or partial cost recovery mechanism.&#13;
20.   Maintenance. The management and maintenance of infrastructure is often the missing link in&#13;
public works investments. Maintenance of infrastructure is generally lacking in Albania; the division of&#13;
responsibilities between central and local government is not always clear, and local governments have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX D                                           - 52 -&#13;
Page 6 of 9&#13;
yet to develop the revenue-raising capabilities required to assure adequate resources. For these reasons,&#13;
the issue of maintenance is specifically addressed in the component's approach and in the contract with&#13;
the municipalities.&#13;
21.   Whenever possible, a users association would be formed and the municipality would collect a&#13;
user's fee. Part of this user contribution would be collected in advance (prior to financing the subproject)&#13;
and deposited into an account for maintenance. To assure transparent administration of this account and&#13;
regular maintenance, a joint management committee would be created composed of municipality&#13;
representatives and an elected user representative. The committee would be in charge of:&#13;
* assuring regular maintenance (cleaning, caretaking) and repair;&#13;
* securing coverage of operating costs; and&#13;
* administering the maintenance fund.&#13;
22.   The user fee would be fixed each year by the joint committee in accordance with foreseen&#13;
operating and maintenance costs.&#13;
23.   Contracts. Contracts for undertaking urban works will involve the following four parties: (a)&#13;
The Albanian Development Fund, which will finance the operation; (b) the municipality, which owns and&#13;
administers the infrastructure; (c) the private enterprise, which carries out the work; and eventually, (d)&#13;
the users association, which uses and maintains the work. The relations (rights and obligations) between&#13;
these parties must be clearly established. Table D.2 shows which contracts pertain to each party.&#13;
TABLE D.2: TYPES OF CONTRACTUAL DOCUMENTS INVOLVED&#13;
Financing&#13;
Bid Documents&#13;

24.      Three contractual documents were drafted during the pre-pilot phase: (a) contract between the&#13;
ADF and the municipality; (b) bidding documents; and (c) the contract between the municipality and the&#13;
private enterprise.&#13;
25.      Bidding Documents. During project negotiations, it was agreed that all urban works, other&#13;
than community participation works, would be procured through National Shopping using the Bank's&#13;
simplified national competitive (NCB) bidding documents for small works below US$250,000 prepared&#13;
for Albania for this purpose and recommended to the Bank borrowers (available on diskette in Albanian&#13;
and English). It was further agreed that the ADF may review and revise the simplified NCB documents,&#13;
but the ADF must prepare a draft for the Bank's review and approval prior to its use.&#13;
26.      Priority Cities. The selection of priority cities is based on the following criteria:&#13;
* high unemployment rate;&#13;
* mix of large and small cities;&#13;
* accessibility from Tirana for efficient use of limited pilot project resources.&#13;
&#13;

unemployed people per family receiving economic assistance.&#13;
5 - A conservative estimae based on the number of unemployed (4) divided by one half of the total urban population&#13;
(1).&#13;
27.    In total, six cities have been selected, encompassing approximately 280,000 inhabitants, which&#13;
is approximately 21 percent the total urban population and about 8.5 percent of the population of Albania&#13;
as a whole.&#13;
28.    It is important to note that interventions will not necessarily be limited to these municipalities,&#13;
but can be expanded to include smaller towns near these urban centers, provided they are in the same&#13;
districts.&#13;
V. COMPONENT INVESTMENTS&#13;
29.    About thirty subprojects would be undertaken during the pilot, for a total of US$1.7 million. The&#13;
urban works would be implemented over two years comprising 15 subprojects in the first year and 15&#13;
subprojects in the second year of implementation. Average subproject costs are estimated at US$48,000&#13;
during project year 1 and US$63,000 in project year 2.&#13;

corresponding to over 5,000 person-months of employment. Materials represent about one-third of total&#13;
subproject cost, about half of which represents imported items. Taxes amount to 24 million lek (14&#13;
percent of subproject cost).&#13;
VI. COMPONENT ORGANIZATION&#13;
31.    Zones. During the pilot project, all engineers will be based in Tirana.&#13;
32.   Staff and Equipment. Seven staff will be required during the pilot project:&#13;
* One department head&#13;
* Four engineers&#13;
* One secretary&#13;
* One Driver&#13;
33.   The following equipment will be required:&#13;
* One vehicle&#13;
* One computer and one printer&#13;
* One photocopier&#13;
* Small equipment and materials (design and measuring materials, etc.) for a total cost of&#13;
about US$1,000&#13;
34.   Technical Assistance and Training. Technical assistance will comprise one long-term technical&#13;
advisor (eighteen months) for both urban and rural works (costs will be shared with the Rural&#13;
Development Project).&#13;
35.   Training will be organized as follows:&#13;
(a) regular training would be organized by the long-term technical assistance.  One-week&#13;
seminars would be organized for both rural and urban engineers, as well as for municipal&#13;
technicians;&#13;
(b) short seminars would be provided to newly-hired engineers on project approach,&#13;
organization, and methodology, after which new recruits would be further trained in the&#13;
field by experienced project staff; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(c) foreign training and group study visits would be organized for project engineers, municipal&#13;
representatives, and municipal technicians from the project area.&#13;
36.   Start-Up Preparation. Preparation for the implementation of the pilot project could begin after&#13;
project approval by the IDA Board, using the resources of the Japanese PHRD grant. This preparation&#13;
would comprise: (a) recruitment and training of engineers3; (b) identification of subprojects; and (c) study&#13;
and analysis of the first subprojects.&#13;
VII. COORDINATION WrH OTHR PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
37.   Rural Infrastructure Component. Potential synergy between urban and rural works should be&#13;
developed using the following:&#13;
(a) technical coordination between the Rural Infrastructure and the Urban Infrastructure&#13;
Departments would be facilitated by the presence of a long-term consultant assisting both&#13;
departments;&#13;
(b) sharing of information and data bases (model contracts, data base on unit costs, etc.);&#13;
(c) common training seminars; and&#13;
(d) exchange of engineers, particularly during the creation of the Urban Infrastructure&#13;
Department; it has been proposed that two rural engineers be employed by the Urban&#13;
Infrastructure Department to share their experiences with the urban team.&#13;
38.   Microenterprise Department. Possible collaboration between the Urban Infrastructure and&#13;
Microenterprise Departments includes the following:&#13;
(a) Rehabilitating workshops or common facility centers. Technical advice and support could&#13;
be provided to the Microenterprise Departnent for rehabilitating workshops for&#13;
microenterprise or common facility centers. The Microenterprise Department would be&#13;
responsible for identifying and preparing these types of subprojects.&#13;
(b) Hiring microenterprise contractors for urban works. In some cases, priority for simple&#13;
urban works could be given to microenterprise contractors to promote growth of the&#13;
contracting sector in certain areas of Albania.&#13;
(c) Training   Microentrepreneurs.        Microentrepreneurs  who  specialize  in&#13;
construction/rehabilitation could be recruited to participate in urban works in order to&#13;
enhance their skills. In such cases, the Microenterprise Department could assist in selecting&#13;
candidates.&#13;

URBAN WORKS AND MICROENTERPRISE PILOT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX E&#13;
SMALL-SCALE CREDIT AND MICROENTERPRISE SUPPORT COMPONENT&#13;
I. POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SMALL PRIVATE SECTOR&#13;
1.    As has been the case for other Central European countries, Albania has experienced high&#13;
unemployment following the collapse of the state sector. As of March 1995, about 34 percent of the&#13;
urban labor force is registered as unemployed, and about 25 percent of the urban labor force is receiving&#13;
unemployment benefits or economic assistance (ndihme ekonomike). Unemployment is particularly high&#13;
in the previous "kombinat" locations, where very specific skills were developed in either male or female&#13;
subgroups of the population. The metallurgic kombinat in Elbasan, for example, employed about 7,000&#13;
men, while the textile kombinat in Berat employed about 10,000 women. Urban unemployment is further&#13;
exacerbated by on-going migration from rural areas.&#13;
2.    In the present transition period, local capital is limited and foreign investors are not yet attracted&#13;
to Albania. This provides fertile ground for the creation of microenterprises, which require very low&#13;
investment. Self-employment can be created rapidly, and the private sector can be developed from the&#13;
bottom up.&#13;
3.    As of March 1995, there are about 46,000 registered private enterprises employing 117,000&#13;
persons (78 percent have only one employee). A number of these small enterprises were created by&#13;
previous state-enterprise workers who initiated their own business activity by acquiring a truck or&#13;
machine during the privatization of small activities. Most of the small and medium enterprises are&#13;
focused on services or trade-in March 1995, the private sector accounted for 96 percent of total imports&#13;
and 56 percent of total exports. 46,000 small and medium enterprises-20 percent of the total-are&#13;
located in Tirana.&#13;
4.    There  is potential for much  greater microenterprise  and  self-employment growth.&#13;
Microenterprises face, however, many difficulties and constraints. Business culture is weak, and there&#13;
is a general lack of understanding of market economy mechanisms and business management, as well as&#13;
a low willingness and capacity to take risks. Demand is limited and the marketing network is poor, while&#13;
raw materials are in short supply and equipment often obsolete. There is not enough working space,&#13;
because it is difficult to buy or rent space; in many towns, some shops have been reprivatized and most&#13;
idle industrial facilities need rehabilitation. Credit for equipment and working capital is virtually&#13;
impossible to find, and there is a general lack of business and technical advice available for emerging&#13;
microentrepreneurs.&#13;
5.    The main subsectors where microenterprises could be developed are the following:&#13;
(a) Urban trade. The collapse of state distribution channels has created many opportunities for&#13;
the creation of small trade businesses.&#13;
(b) Rehabilitation and Maintenance. Due to the privatization of the housing sector, there is&#13;
an  important  market  potential  for  housing  rehabilitation,  maintenance,  and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX E                                           - 58 -&#13;
Page 2 of 15&#13;
upgrading-including painting, plumbing, and electrical repair. There is also a steady&#13;
demand for the repair of domestic electric appliances, such as radios, televisions, and&#13;
refrigerators, and automobile repair and maintenance is in growing demand, because private&#13;
automobile ownership has increased rapidly through the import of second-hand cars. So far,&#13;
automobile garages are few in number, with the exception of tire repair shops.&#13;
(c) Urban transportation. Here, also, there are important opportunities for development of&#13;
private taxi and transport activities.&#13;
(d) Building sector.  This is one of the few  sectors facing significant local demand.&#13;
Microenterprise production of tiles and bricks has already started, because it requires low&#13;
levels of  investment.  In addition to the production of building materials, other&#13;
microentrepreneurial activities in the building sector include bricklaying, floor making,&#13;
plumbing, electricity, and joinery.&#13;
(e) Woodwork. With the exception of doors, frames and windows, local demand for high-&#13;
quality carpentry, joinery, and cabinet making is low; it will probably grow with increases&#13;
in the standard of living.  Some microenterprises already exist, created by previous&#13;
kombinat workers who bought some equipment from factories. The equipment, however,&#13;
is obsolete and the building facilities are often too small or inappropriate.  These&#13;
microenterprises should be modernized and given access to credit. New microenterprises&#13;
could be created by young people graduating from technical schools.&#13;
(f) Apparel. This sector once employed thousands of workers, especially women. In several&#13;
towns that have an old tradition of fabric work, such as Berat and Shkoder, a skilled labor&#13;
force is available at a cost many times lower than that found in Western Europe. Albania&#13;
has a considerable comparative advantage in this sector and could gain over some segments&#13;
of the international market from  Southeast Asia and North Africa.  Thousands of&#13;
microenterprises (less than 5 persons employed) could be created in this subsector if private&#13;
initiatives were to receive some support in the areas of supply and marketing organization,&#13;
access to credit, and business advice.&#13;
(g) Kilims, carpets. During the communist period, kilims and carpets were produced for&#13;
export in large state enterprises located in a number of municipalities. Although these&#13;
enterprises are closed (some have been privatized, but remain closed or are operating&#13;
precariously), the tradition of kilim making remains very alive in some rural areas where&#13;
young women are traditionally expected to make at least one kilim before getting married.&#13;
Development of microenterprises in this subsector requires input in design (a design center&#13;
for the whole textile sector was recently created in Tirana), credit for working capital (for&#13;
the purchase of wool, dyes etc), and some support for marketing abroad.&#13;
(h) Handicraft.  In some cities, such as Shkoder and Kruja, there is an old tradition of&#13;
handicraft, including silver jewelry, copper work, wood sculpture, and embroidery. Export&#13;
markets disappeared together with the state marketing network. Craftsmen now work as&#13;
private entrepreneurs and serve only a very limited local market. The main support needed&#13;
in this sector is new design, marketing, and credit for equipment and working capital.&#13;
&#13;

11. CREDIT AND BUSINESS SUPPORT IN ALBANIA&#13;
6.     Microenterpreneurs in Albania currently lack access to formal and donor-financed credit.&#13;
Albania's state-owned banks are not equipped to make very small loans, and even have difficulty&#13;
making-and recovering-larger loans. The new private banks are not providing lek-based loans, and&#13;
donor-financed credit programs focus on loans above US$10,000. Even if small credits were available,&#13;
most microentrepreneurs are unfamiliar with how to prepare business plans.&#13;
Formal Credit Systems&#13;
7.     Albania's formal banking sector does not yet have the institutional capability to serve the financial&#13;
needs of the private sector. The banking sector is still dominated by state-owned banks, which have had&#13;
very limited success in "commercializing" their operations. Procedures for approving loans-and&#13;
supervising loan repayment-are largely inadequate, and loan default rates at all state-owned banks are&#13;
very high. Consequently, several banks strictly limited credit in 1994-only 54 percent of the credit&#13;
ceiling imposed by the central bank was used. With the exception of the National Commercial Bank,&#13;
which lends to state-owned enterprises, and the Dardania Bank, which makes short-term foreign exchange&#13;
loans, banks are continuing to lend far below their credit limits in early 1995.&#13;
8.    Progress has been made in establishing the legal and regulatory environment for a market&#13;
economy: Parliament has approved, among others, a tax law, a company law, a labor law, an accounting&#13;
law, and a central bank and banking law. The regulatory environment for the financial sector is not yet&#13;
complete. Albania still lacks a modern bankruptcy law, and there is no legal provision for enforcing loan&#13;
collateral.&#13;
9.    Interest Rates. Interest rates in Albania are not set by market forces; minimum interest rates&#13;
for deposits in lek and guideline interest rates for lending in lek are given by the central bank. As of&#13;
June 1995, the 12 month deposit rate is 14.5 percent, and the 12 month lending rate is 20 percent. The&#13;
evolution of interest rates in Albania is shown in Table E. 1. Interest rates on foreign currency deposits&#13;
are set in line with European rates.&#13;
10.   Banking Institutions. The emergence of commercial banks is a recent phenomenon in Albania.&#13;
Until 1991, Albania had three state-owned banking institutions: the State Bank of Albania (SBA), the&#13;
Savings Bank, and the State Agriculture Bank. In 1991, the State Agricultural Bank became the Bank&#13;
of Agriculture and Development (BAD), and a fourth state-owned bank, the Albanian Commercial Bank&#13;
(ACB), was created from the Foreign Relations Department of the SBA.&#13;
11.   A two-tier banking system was created in April 1992. The SBA became the Bank of Albania,&#13;
retaining only the functions of a central bank. The commercial operations were integrated into the&#13;
National Bank of Albania (NBA). On January 1, 1993, the NBA and ACB were merged to form the&#13;
National Commercial Bank of Albania. In October 1993, the BAD was restructured and its performing&#13;
assets and deposits were transferred to the new Rural Commercial Bank.&#13;
12.   In addition, two small joint-venture banks were created in late 1992 and 1993, and one private&#13;
bank was created in 1994. These banks focus on dealing with a few selected credit customers and play&#13;
no major role yet in mobilizing savings or providing investment finance.&#13;

13.    Bank of Albania. The Bank of Albania (BoA), which is Albania's central bank, has headquarters&#13;
in Tirana and five branches in other major cities. The BoA supervises other banks and controls the&#13;
money supply through direct control of total credit expansion of the banking system. The BoA has been&#13;
pursuing a tight monetary policy, and credit ceilings, in line with targeted inflation and output growth,&#13;
are imposed on the banks' total lending to the economy, including government. Once the ceiling for the&#13;
central bank's lending to the Government is subtracted from the total ceiling, the remaining amount is&#13;
divided among commercial banks by imposing sub-ceilings on a bank-by-bank basis.&#13;
14.    National Commercial Bank. The National Commercial Bank (NCB), previously structured to&#13;
provide loans only to state enterprises, was "commercialized" and expanded in 1993 to include the private&#13;
sector. It is the largest bank in terms of number of transactions, and it is the only bank to have reached&#13;
its second quarter 1995 credit ceiling. The bank, which has 30 branches and 1,100 employees, also&#13;
serves larger clients than any other bank in the country-about 50 percent of the 1995 loan portfolio&#13;
represents 20 big creditors, most of which are state-owned and include the National Housing Agency.&#13;
Although some lending has been extended to the private sector, NCB still functions mainly as the&#13;
Government's bank. Technical assistance is being provided by the US Treasury and EBRD.&#13;
15.    Rural Commercial Bank.  The Rural Commercial Bank (RCB) was created in October 1993,&#13;
when BAD's unrecoverable loans to state enterprises were liquidized and the bank was recapitalized. A&#13;
comprehensive program of institutional strengthening in key areas was initiated upon creation of the bank.&#13;
RCB has 27 branches and about 700 employees.&#13;
16.    Savings Bank. The Savings Banks was founded in 1991 as an offspring of the former Savings&#13;
and Insurance Institute, which was formed in 1948 to take deposits and collect insurance payments from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -                                       ANNEX E&#13;

individuals. The bank, which has 27 branches and about 900 employees, has a large proportion (about&#13;
80 percent) of Albania's household savings. Although it is licensed to make loans, the Savings Bank is&#13;
opting for a low risk strategy with a limited loan portfolio. The Savings Bank is receiving technical and&#13;
financial assistance from EBRD and EU/PHARE, and it will be the credit window for phase 2 of the EU&#13;
Phare SME program.&#13;
17.   Smaller Private Banks. The private banking sector is virtually non-existent-three private banks&#13;
are currently in operation. Each of these private banks has one office in Tirana.&#13;
18.   The Italian-Albanian Bank was founded in late-1992 as a 50/50 joint venture between Banco di&#13;
Roma (Italy) and the National Commercial Bank. The EBRD recently acquired a 20 percent share,&#13;
reducing the other shares to 40 percent each. The bank accepts foreign exchange and lek deposits, and&#13;
lends in foreign exchange mainly to Italian companies and mainly for trade. The bank has made only&#13;
a few private investment loans, one of which was the establishment of a Coca-Cola bottling facility&#13;
(Italian subsidiary) in Albania.&#13;
19.   The Dardania Bank was registered in 1993 by the government-in-exile of Kosovo. It is Albania's&#13;
smallest bank and the only one with no Albanian state ownership. The bank accepts foreign exchange&#13;
(US dollar) deposits and is making short-term foreign exchange (US dollar) loans. It is not expected to&#13;
play a significant role in private enterprise financing&#13;
20.   The Arab-Albanian Islamic Bank (AAIB) is a joint venture bank started in 1994-it is 60 percent&#13;
foreign (10 percent Bahrain-based Arab Islamic Bank, 15 percent Islamic Development Bank, 10 percent&#13;
Dallah-Baraka Group, and 15 percent Saudi Arabia private investors) and 40 percent local (state-owned&#13;
capital held by the National Commercial Bank). Arab investments for Albania are flowing through the&#13;
AAIB. As of early 1995, the AAIB is accepting foreign exchange deposits and not lending.&#13;
Informal Credit Systems&#13;
21.   Several informal credit systems have been identified, primarily in the area of trade and retail.&#13;
They are not yet very developed in the manufacturing and processing sectors. The following are some&#13;
examples of informal credit opportunities which have been observed primarily in Tirana and Shkoder.&#13;
22.   Small loans for 3-6 months from friends and family are extended at a monthly interest rate of&#13;
about 5 percent. These loans often range from US$500-1,000.&#13;
23.    One-day loans in the form of payment deferral: Some traders in the Tirana wholesale market buy&#13;
their goods directly from trucks parked at the edge of the market and are not required to pay for these&#13;
goods until the end of the day when they pay only for what they actually sold. This system is not only&#13;
very flexible and convenient for the market traders, but also provides them with a de facto one-day loan&#13;
which they repay in the evening with the proceeds from the day's sales. Prices of goods naturally reflect&#13;
this additional credit element and are higher than those for cash customers. The profitability of traders&#13;
who sell goods taken on one-day credit is lower than that of traders who pay cash for their goods.&#13;
24.    Open-ended loans with no fixed term but with a monthly interest rate of 10 percent are provided&#13;
by informal lenders to a limited number of traders who engage in import-export activities. The loans,&#13;
whose amounts were impossible to determine, do not have a fixed maturity but the full amount of the loan&#13;
is recallable at one month's notice by the lender. Monthly payments comprise only interest, and the&#13;
principal is payable only when the loan is recalled.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX E                                             - 62 -&#13;
Page 6 of 15&#13;
25.    More traditional informal credit carrying 4-5 percent monthly interest and maturing in a&#13;
maximum of six months is also available to the small business community. The source of these loans&#13;
is not clear, but there is apparently some excess liquidity in the economy which is pooled and re-directed&#13;
by small-scale informal lenders who become known in the community.&#13;
26.    'Lottery" savings circles existed during the communist period-women working in the same&#13;
factory came together in savings groups to buy household durables. Each woman would contribute a&#13;
small amount of savings on a regular basis. In a process similar to a lottery drawing, one group member&#13;
after another would "win" the accumulated savings for her own use. Since these funds were not loans,&#13;
but rather members' savings, this system should be regarded as a savings mechanism rather than a source&#13;
of credit. However, it performed a very useful and important function in making funds available for&#13;
household investment.&#13;
27.    Remittances from Albanians living abroad are often reinjected in the Albanian economy in the&#13;
form of informal credit. Annual remittances from Albanian expatriates abroad are estimated to be about&#13;
US$300 million, which far exceeds the total amount of donor funds flowing to Albania from all other&#13;
sources combined. The form of these remittances can be consumer durables for family use and/or resale.&#13;
Often, however, the remittances come in the form of cash, which can be used for personal consumption&#13;
or onlending in the informal market. In some cases, the funds remain in smaller circles of family and&#13;
friends and are not lent against interest. In some other instances, funds are lent in foreign currency and&#13;
must also be repaid in that foreign currency. In the case of Kosovons, for example, German Marks are&#13;
lent for a specific business activity and the borrower must repay his Kosovon friend or family member&#13;
in German Marks. Therefore the actual lenders are not in Albania but are based in Germany.&#13;
28.   Joint-Venture businesses are established by Albanians and foreigners (often Greek or Italian) who&#13;
share unequally in the proceeds of the business in accordance with the initial capital contribution. As a&#13;
protective measure, the Albanian will insist on maintaining majority share of the business, but the foreign&#13;
party will receive a disproportionately larger share of the profits in exchange for submitting to majority&#13;
Albanian ownership. This kind of joint venture investment is considered in many circles as an informal&#13;
source of "credit," because important funding was made available for the establishment of a local&#13;
business.&#13;
Other Institutions and Organizations&#13;
29.    The Chamber of Commerce was originally a branch of the Ministry of Trade and only established&#13;
itself as an independent, self-financing institution in August 1992. The Tirana Chamber, which&#13;
established branches in other parts of the country, views itself as the National Chamber representing the&#13;
private business sector. As with most other institutions in the country, the Chamber has no real&#13;
experience in supporting private enterprise or small businesses and is in the process of defining its own&#13;
role in the newly democratized Albania.&#13;
30.    The primary role of the Association of Private Entrepreneurs, formed in 1991, is to provide&#13;
members with information about the legal environment pertaining to business, import-export trade, and&#13;
investment, and to serve as a voice for the business community. The Association is a member of the&#13;
Chamber of Commerce and currently has two separate factions: the Vlore-based association which covers&#13;
the South and Southwest, and the Tirana-based association which covers the rest of Albania.&#13;
31.    7he EU PHARE Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Project is the only existing donor-financed&#13;
project channeling credit to small businesses. The EU initially tried to identify viable indigenous&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -                                          ANNEX E&#13;
Page 7 of 15&#13;
organizations or associations through which the EU could work. Because of the uncertain status of the&#13;
Chamber of Commerce and the Associations of Private Entrepreneurs, it became apparent that a new type&#13;
of SME support organization was necessary. Therefore, the EU established seven Regional Business&#13;
Agencies (RBA), modeled after Western European development agencies.&#13;
32.    The RBAs operate as independent private companies, each directed by a board of representatives&#13;
from the Ministry of Economy and Finance; Districts, Municipalities, and Communes; the Chamber of&#13;
Commerce; the Association of Private Entrepreneurs; the banks; the Faculty of Economics at the&#13;
University of Tirana; and the Albanian SME Support Unit (EU). RBAs have been assisted by Peace&#13;
Corps volunteers who are stationed in RBAs around the county.&#13;
33.    The Activities of the RBAs include:&#13;
(a) handling inquiries and serving as a liaison between the entrepreneurs, the Chamber of&#13;
Commerce, Ministries, Districts, Municipalities and Communes, aid agencies, and private&#13;
associations;&#13;
(b) assistance in the preparation of business plans for individual entrepreneurs and for&#13;
documentation supporting credit applications;&#13;
(c) seminars and training in small business-related topics; and&#13;
(d) collection of information for SME needs in the region, including a database of businesses,&#13;
library books, technical literature, information on taxation, and legal and regulatory&#13;
information.&#13;
34.    During the first phase of the EU project, for which a credit line of ECU 1.1 million (US$1.3&#13;
million) was established, about 152 loans were provided to small and medium-scale entrepreneurs, with&#13;
an average loan size of about US$10,000. The loan period was for a maximum of three years (including&#13;
a 3-month grace period) and the annual interest rate was 17 percent. Loan payments were made through&#13;
the National Commercial Bank. Repayment was much worse than anticipated and is estimated at only&#13;
50 percent in early-1995 (about 50 percent of the loans are either in several months arrears or in complete&#13;
default with the borrower disappearing). The situation has improved some from last year, when an&#13;
estimated 75 percent of the loans were in arrears or default.&#13;
35.    The second phase of the EU project, which was supposed to begin in June 1993, would replenish&#13;
the credit line by ECU 3 million and increase the average loan size to an estimated US$15,000'. The&#13;
second phase is expected to focus on manufacturing. Interest rates would increase slightly as a 5 percent&#13;
transaction fee has been added to the existing 17 percent annual interest rate. The EU is helping to set&#13;
up a Small and Medium Enterprise Department in the Savings Bank, which will handle the account and&#13;
take over the task of screening loan applications. The RBAs will continue to provide technical assistance&#13;
in the form of business planning and marketing advice for entrepreneurs interested in expanding their&#13;
businesses and applying for credit.&#13;
36.    Since the loan size under the second phase of the EU program is expected to increase, any risk&#13;
of overlap between the EU project and small credit component of the Urban Works and Microenterprise&#13;
Pilot Project has been completely eliminated. The enterprises benefitting from the SME project are larger&#13;
The second phase of the SME program has experienced a number of start-up delays; it is not yet operational as of May&#13;
1995.&#13;
&#13;

and more sophisticated than the target group for the small credit component. There will be important&#13;
linkages between the two groups (subcontracting arrangements, learning and exposure, and apprenticeship&#13;
opportunities), but the credit mechanisms serving the two groups will necessarily be different.&#13;
37.    The ORT Human Resource Development Program, financed by USAID, has provided adult&#13;
training to about 3,000 Albanians, especially ex-political prisoners, since its inception in January 1992.&#13;
Originally, training programs sponsored by ORT (Organization for Educational Resources and&#13;
Technological Training) were limited to ex-politically persecuted people. Currently, programs are&#13;
available to unemployed people whose unemployment benefits have expired. The program, which is&#13;
established in the municipalities of Tirana, Durres, Vlora, and Shkoder, offers six- and twelve-week&#13;
courses on topics that include cosmetology, English, secretarial skills, tourism and auto mechanics.&#13;
ORT's involvement is expected to extend to early 1997, at which point the program will be sustained by&#13;
the Ministry of Labor.&#13;
38.    7he Training, Enterprise, and Employment Fund (TEEF), was created in May 1993 under the&#13;
IDA-financed Labor Market Development Project and supports four types of adult training.&#13;
(a) Job Insertion. TEEF will finance training courses within an enterprise for a minimum of&#13;
20 people. TEEF will cover the costs of the local trainer and most surrounding logistics&#13;
for courses that can last up to three months. TEEF has financed courses for both local&#13;
and foreign enterprises, including footwear, apparel, carpets, bakeries, and construction&#13;
firms.&#13;
(b) Institutional Training. TEEF will organize training in any given subject if there is&#13;
adequate demand. Typically, courses last from one to nine months and rent the services&#13;
of a private enterprise for support. For example, an Italian cooking course was organized&#13;
in the kitchen of a local hotel. Training needs are identified by twelve TEEF agents who&#13;
work out of the twelve regional labor offices.&#13;
(c) Business Clubs. TEEF will pay business clubs to help organize training and internships&#13;
with successful enterprises. After such training, the individual might be ready to apply&#13;
for a loan and be referred to a credit program for assistance.&#13;
(d) Incubators. In the longer term, two business incubators (in Tirana and Shkoder) will be&#13;
established and financed by TEEF. They will each total about 3,000 sq. meters and will&#13;
provide various services to about thirty businesses.&#13;
III. COMPONENT OBJECTIVES&#13;
39.   The two main objectives of the component are:&#13;
(a) The rapid creation of employment, thereby cutting dependency on economic assistance&#13;
programs; and&#13;
(b) The development of the private sector from the bottom up.&#13;
40.   The project will be demand driven and will focus on provision of small-scale credit and, at the&#13;
same time, business and technical advice to microentrepreneurs. The project will also address the high&#13;
concentration of skilled labor in some urban centers (for example, textile workers in Berat) by using a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -                                     ANNEX E&#13;
Page 9 of 15&#13;
sector-orientated approach to encourage and support private initiatives. This sector approach will be&#13;
based on (a) marketing and technical studies of key subsectors; (b) creation of a few model demonstration&#13;
units and/or common facility centers, if requested by private microentrepreneurs; and (c) establishment&#13;
of a data base and information center on small technologies.&#13;
41.    The medium and long-term objectives of the component are to work out the methods and&#13;
procedures for the implementation of the full-scale project, particularly:&#13;
(a) Test urban microenterprise lending that combines poverty alleviation with economic&#13;
growth on a progressively sustainable basis;&#13;
(b) Build a financial and social intermediation system that combines small-scale credit and&#13;
technical and business advice to microentrepreneurs; and&#13;
(c) Identify obstacles to development of the small private sector.&#13;
IV. EXPERIENCE UNDER THE PRE-PILOT PHASE&#13;
42.    Following the process approach that was successfully applied under the Rural Poverty Alleviation&#13;
Pilot Project (RPAPP), a pre-pilot phase was initiated in February 1994 in order to identify the main&#13;
obstacles to the development of microenterprises in urban areas and to define the approach of the pilot&#13;
phase. Three types of action have been undertaken: (a) an experimental subproject to create knitting&#13;
microenterprises in Shkoder; (b) a first identification of the main subsectors to be targeted later; and (c)&#13;
provision of demand-driven credit to unemployed persons.&#13;
Knitting Microenterprise Project&#13;
43.    The knitting microenterprise project in Shkoder was initially going to promote approximately 20&#13;
knitting microenterprises in partnership with a private Italian firm.  The microenterprises were to be&#13;
created by women who have already worked in this field, who would receive complimentary on-the-job&#13;
training from the Italian enterprise and, at the end of the 6-week training period, would be granted a loan&#13;
from the project for the purchase of a knitting machine. The Italian company would supply the raw&#13;
materials and would buy the final products. A service unit would provide common services such as&#13;
mechanical and electrical maintenance as well as some management advice.&#13;
44.   The pilot project proved more difficult to implement than was originally expected. Initially, the&#13;
women were extremely interested and the program was oversubscribed (300 candidates for only 20 spots).&#13;
This response may be partially explained by the fact that the women were to be paid during the training&#13;
period.  Once trained, however, the women showed extremely risk-averse behavior, which is&#13;
incompatible with the creation of a private business, and they refused the idea of installing the knitting&#13;
equipment at home, possibly owing to difficult housing conditions.&#13;
45.    Meanwhile, the Italian firm was mainly interested in finding cheap labor resources. The training&#13;
provided was limited to technical skills without taking into account the difficult psychological transition&#13;
from working as a low-productivity laborer to an independent and productivity-oriented entrepreneur.&#13;
No business advice or training was provided. Furthermore, in terms of machinery and equipment, good&#13;
quality second-hand machines proved more difficult to find than expected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

46.    The ADF staff in charge of the project were themselves not very familiar with private business&#13;
practices. Constraints and behaviors created by 40 years of central management further hindered the&#13;
development of the subproject.&#13;
47.    After several months, it was decided that the initiative should be left to the women themselves.&#13;
The ADF staff will follow-up will provide technical or financial support if requested to do so.&#13;
Regardless of what the final result will be in terms of microenterprise promotion, this first subproject has&#13;
provided a very important experience for the further development of the project. It assisted in the design&#13;
of the microenterprise support activities as a support to individual or group initiatives, rather than a top-&#13;
down approach.&#13;
Identification of Subsectors&#13;
48.    A   first  identification  of  subsectors  for&#13;
microenterprise promotion was carried out on the wood     TABLE E.2: TYPES OF SUBLOANS&#13;

methodologies.&#13;
51.    As of June 1, 1995, 62 loan applications have been approved-53 in Tirana, 7 in Shijak, and 2&#13;
in Shkoder. Subloans range from US$600 to US$3,000 and average US$1,900; and loan duration ranges&#13;
from 5 to 12 months and averages 10 months. The loans are being used to finance a variety of business&#13;
activities in trade and small manufacturing, including a small pharmacy, small shops, restaurants, joinery,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

handicrafts, car repair, and car washes. Thirty-seven of the borrowers had no formal or informal&#13;
economic activity at the time of the loan-8 of them were receiving social assistance (such as pensions)&#13;
and 4 were receiving economic assistance (ndhime ekonomike). The remaining 25 borrowers had some&#13;
informal economic activity at the time of the loan. A summary of the types of subloans is shown in&#13;
Table E.2. These early credit experiences have helped to construct a first outline of the small credit&#13;
component under the pilot project.&#13;
V. Component Investments and Methods of Intervention&#13;
52.    Number of Subloans. The Small-Scale Credit and Microenterprise Support Component amounts&#13;
to approximately US$1.8 million (base costs), of which about US$1.5 million is available for small credit.&#13;
It is estimated that approximately 1,960 subloans will be given during the two-year project period, based&#13;
on revolving account with a subloan average of US$2,000 each, an average loan duration of 9 months,&#13;
an interest rate of 2 percent monthly, and a repayment rate of 90 percent. A repayment rate of 95&#13;
percent would permit about 2,125 subloans under the same conditions, a repayment rate of 85 percent&#13;
would permit about 1,800 subloans, and a repayment rate of 80 percent would permit about 1,600&#13;
subloans. Projections of outstanding principal and interest earned on 1,960 subloans at the end of one and&#13;
two years for three possible repayment scenarios-80, 95 and 100 percent repayment-are shown in&#13;
Table E.3.&#13;
53.    Conditions of eligibility. The purpose of the small credit program is not to compete with the&#13;
formal banking sector, but to provide financial and social intermediation for people who do not have&#13;
access to banks. The conditions of eligibility will therefore be the following:&#13;
(a) the loan applicant must be unemployed or receiving state economic assistance;&#13;
(b) the objective of the project should be the establishment of any income-generating activity&#13;
(the pilot project may also experiment with home- and building-improvement loans to&#13;
members of condominium associations);&#13;
(c) the borrower should have the basic know-how and experience required for the success of&#13;
the activity;&#13;
(d) the borrower must be highly motivated; and&#13;
(e) subloans should normally be granted for the promotion of new microenterprises (in some&#13;
cases, they may also be granted to existing microenterprises to ensure their further&#13;
development and create additional jobs).&#13;

54.     Loan Conditions. The provisional loan terms include:&#13;
(a)  a maximum  loan ceiling of US$3000; in exceptional cases, the loan ceiling may be&#13;
US$5,000;2&#13;
(b)  a maturity of less than 12 months;&#13;
(c)  interest rate no less than commercial interest rates (the interest rate has been 2 percent&#13;
monthly during the pre-pilot phase);&#13;
(d)  repayments are on a one-monthly or half-monthly basis; and&#13;
(e)  loan guarantees, based on the capacity of the borrower, may take different forms discussed&#13;
below. During the pilot phase, loans will require close supervision by the credit officers.&#13;
2    It was agreed during negotiations that the maximum subloan size for the small credit program would be US$5,000 in the&#13;
Operational Guidelines, but that a higher limit of US$10,000 would be established in the legal agreenents in order to&#13;
allow for flexibility in the future in the event of special circumstances of chainged conditions.&#13;
&#13;

55.    Guarantee Systems. As in other microenterprise lending projects, the most difficult problem&#13;
is security and collateral. The target group members do not have real collateral; and legal procedures&#13;
for contract enforcement are arduous even in the presence of collateral. In most cases, a social guarantee&#13;
system is preferable. It reduces the lender's transaction costs, because the solidarity group assumes the&#13;
roles of appraisal, guarantee, and repayment.&#13;
56.    Based on the experience of the pre-pilot phase, three types of collateral seem to be possible:&#13;
(i) Community guarantee. Under the pre-pilot phase, a Romany (gypsy) association has&#13;
been created and registered with the municipal court of Tirana. The statutes include a&#13;
community guarantee of loan repayment in the event of default. Non-compliance would&#13;
result in suspension of all future loans to members of the association. This solidarity&#13;
group-oriented guarantee could be used also for other types of groups, such as former&#13;
prisoners, neighbors in smaller towns, or women entrepreneurs. Some women in poor&#13;
neighborhoods of Tirana have been receptive to solidarity groups for credit, because it is&#13;
similar to the lottery system they participated in when employed by the state enterprises.&#13;
Establishment of a women's solidarity group has been difficult to organize so far, due&#13;
mainly to weak social cohesion in urban areas. Women's dairy support groups&#13;
established in Shkoder district under the Land O'Lakes project, could be candidates for&#13;
small credit to expand their dairy activity and market their products in nearby towns.&#13;
(ii) Notarized contract. An alternative guarantee system would be to mimic existing social&#13;
mechanisms in which the borrower and lender prepare a written contract which is signed&#13;
by both parties in front of a notary in the presence of other witnesses known to both&#13;
parties. Collateral typically consists of household effects. This system is very difficult&#13;
to enforce in the absence of a genuine desire to uphold the contract, as the legal&#13;
framework is not strong enough yet to provide the necessary punitive support in case of&#13;
default, and as punitive action is not really applicable to poor people.&#13;
(iii) Character referrals. Another system being tested under the pre-pilot phase consists in&#13;
finding a guarantee based on a personal character reference, preferably from an elected&#13;
public official. Such a system of character vouching relies on the fact that contract&#13;
abidance is important for an elected official to "save face" and preserve honor, a very&#13;
important concept in Albanian society. This method has been tested-with good results&#13;
so far-in the municipality of Shijak.&#13;
57.    Creation of guarantee fund. In addition to these three types of collateral, a guarantee fund&#13;
could be established, limited in the first stage to cases where loans cannot be repaid due to an emergency,&#13;
death, or accident. This fund would be financed as follows:&#13;
(a) the initial capital would consist of the pre-pilot phase credit fund financed by grant money,&#13;
once the loans distributed from this fund are repaid;&#13;
(b) a gradual deduction of 10 percent of the interest rate would be paid on the loan;&#13;
(c) a contribution of I percent of the total loan amount would be received at the beginning of&#13;
the loan and reimbursed when the loan has been repaid in full. The emergency fund would&#13;
be progressively implemented on a local basis and its management would be ensured with&#13;
the participation of the borrowers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX E                                            -70 -&#13;
Page 14 of 15&#13;
58.    Credit Committee. All loans would be approved by a Credit Committee that is currently&#13;
composed of the Director of the Rural Credit Department of RDF, a representative of the banks, and the&#13;
head of the Urban Credit pre-pilot project team. This committee meets on a regular basis in order to&#13;
discuss loans for approval or rescheduling, as well as to progressively establish urban credit procedures.&#13;
Individual applications are presented and defended by the credit officer responsible for loan preparation&#13;
and follow-up. The composition of the committee will be dynamic and subject to change as the project&#13;
evolves. It will be as decentralized as possible, and will progressively involve not only representatives&#13;
of the Project and of the banking sector, but also representatives of the borrowers.&#13;
59.    Financial Sustainability. One of the objectives of the component is to develop a credit delivery&#13;
system for microentrepreneurs that would be financially sustainable in the long run. During the pilot&#13;
phase, sustainability will be carefully monitored, and efforts will be taken to identify financial&#13;
intermediation costs (which must be covered by interest) and social intermediation costs (which will not&#13;
be covered by interest during the pilot project.) Calculation of a Subsidy Dependency Index at the end&#13;
of 1996 and 1997 will also assist in monitoring the level of subsidy arising from the subsidized capital&#13;
(IDA credit given to the ADF as a grant from the Government).3   About US$300,000 equivalent of&#13;
interest is expected to be earned at the end of two years (see Table E.2.). The expected interest is about&#13;
equivalent to the anticipated investment and operational costs of the Urban Credit Division for two years,&#13;
including social intermediation costs, but not including technical assistance or ADF overhead costs&#13;
(Annex B, Table B.10).&#13;
60.    Innovation Fund. The component will also finance an innovation fund (US$75,000 base costs),&#13;
which will support about five model subprojects and/or common facility centers in key subsectors in order&#13;
to demonstrate new technologies and new forms of production and marketing. These individual- or&#13;
group-owned projects would not be created a priori, but only if established by a private entrepreneur or&#13;
by a producers' association. They would operate as demonstration projects for the microentrepreneurs&#13;
of the same subsector. They would therefore be financed by credit and possible start-up grants&#13;
representing up to 30 percent of the total investment. The grant would not only compensate for the risk&#13;
associated with experimental activities, but would also allow ADF to use the model microenterprises for&#13;
demonstration and training.&#13;
VI. Component Organization&#13;
61.    The urban credit and microenterprise support component would be implemented under the&#13;
guidance of Rural Credit Department of the Albanian Development Fund, in order to take advantage of&#13;
the small credit experience in rural areas and the skills of the Rural Credit Department staff.&#13;
62.    Under the pre-pilot phase, small-scale credit tests have been focused in Tirana, where a team of&#13;
four credit officers has been recruited, and in near-by Shijak. Recently, a credit officer was recruited&#13;
in Shkoder, where two loans have been approved so far. Under the pilot phase the project could expand&#13;
to two additional locations-Berat and Kavaja. These five locations have been selected because of (a)&#13;
high rate of unemployment; (b) existence of local skills especially in the textile sector for Shkoder and&#13;
Berat and carpet industry for Kavaja; (c) existing contacts with artisans; and (d) easy access from Tirana.&#13;
In each location, the credit team would consist of two to four trained staff.&#13;

&#13;

Page 15 of 15&#13;
63.    The pilot small credit program would be based on:&#13;
(a) a survey of local skills, markets, alternative credit sources, working space, and other&#13;
constraints to the development of microenterprises;&#13;
(b) identification of the target population and information/action organized through the local&#13;
labor offices, municipality offices providing ndihma ekonomike, local announcements, and&#13;
individual contacts;&#13;
(c) selection of the potential borrowers;&#13;
(d) economic and financial analysis of the proposed projects;&#13;
(e) loan management and accounting;&#13;
(f) close follow-up of the project; and&#13;
(g) experience and capacity building.&#13;
64.    Following subloan approval by the Credit Committee, subloans would be disbursed by a bank,&#13;
and loan repayments would be made into that bank's account. Each credit team will be provided with&#13;
a small office, a computer, a motorcycle, and a bicycles for each credit officers. Given the innovative&#13;
character of the project in Albania, frequent missions by a consultant will be required during the pilot&#13;
project in order to train the Albanian staff in economic and financial analysis and specific methods of&#13;
lending for microenterprise creation. At the same time, the consultant will provide support for the&#13;
development of component methods and procedures, which would be adapted to local conditions.&#13;
65.    The credit officers will be in charge of business and technical advice to their clients, relying on&#13;
specialized local consultants if necessary. These consultants could be recruited among previous state-&#13;
enterprise specialists or within specialized institutes and remunerated on a per-service basis. Subsector&#13;
studies and the establishment of a data base and information center on small technologies will assist in&#13;
providing advice.&#13;
66.    Credit officers would keep weekly time sheets, recording the time spent on various tasks. These&#13;
time sheets would be an important mechanism to monitor the time spent-and expenditure-on financial&#13;
intermediation versus social intermediation.&#13;
67.    Cooperation would be sought with the SME Foundation and other projects, especially in the field&#13;
of technical information and basic business training for ADF staff and local consultants. This cooperation&#13;
cannot be extended to all fields of intervention, since the microentrepreneurs and the subprojects are far&#13;
below the level targeted by these other institutions, and the methods applied will be quite different from&#13;
those used for SME promotion.&#13;

URBAN WORKS AND MICROENTERPRISE PILOT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX F&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION AND SUPERVISION PLANS: KEY DATES&#13;
1.    The implementation framework for the Urban Works and Microenterprise Pilot Project is largely&#13;
in place, because of the similarity of the project to the Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project (RPAPP),&#13;
and the implementation experience of the Albanian Development Fund (ADF). In addition, the pre-pilot&#13;
phase allowed for testing methods and procedures of the urban components and for recruiting and training&#13;
the small-scale credit team. The engineer in charge of the urban works component is an experienced staff&#13;
who previously worked on the rural works component of the RPAPP. The project will use existing ADF&#13;
structures for financing and monitoring.&#13;
2.    The main organizational issues to be addressed for both the urban and the rural projects are: (a)&#13;
strengthening financial and administrative management; and (b) finalizing implementation of the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation system. Implementation of the overall project is covered in Chapter III of the&#13;
SAR, implementation of the urban works component is described in Annex D, and implementation of the&#13;
small credit and microenterprise support component is described in Annex E. Some implementation&#13;
details are expected to be worked out during the pilot project, using a participatory and process approach.&#13;
3.    Key actions and dates for project start up and implementation are shown in Table F. 1. The&#13;
estimated Supervision Plan for the project is shown in Table F.2.&#13;

            Albania - Urban Works and Microenterprise
            Pilot Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Urban Works and Microenterprise
            Pilot Project will help the Government to develop a
            five-year program to boost employment and small-scale
            economic activity in urban areas, based on the successful
            approach of the Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project.
            Objectives of the five-year Pilot Program will be: 1) to
            create employment and stimulate private-sector activity in
            urban areas; 2) to repair basic urban infrastructure; 3) to
            promote microenterprises; and 4) to assist local governments
            obtain the skills they need for promoting economic
            development in the long run. The project will test
            approaches to the program's implementation during its
            first two years. Pilot project components are: 1) establish
            the necessary implementation framework for the proposed
            program by expanding the existing Rural Development Fund
            into an Albanian Development Fund; 2) urban works. Organize
            approximately 30 public works, which will rehabilitate small
            infrastructure, create needed market facilities, or address
            environmental problems; 3) small-scale credit and
            microenterprise support; and 4) studies and training to
            evaluate project impact and help local governments to
            acquire the skills needed for promoting long-term local development.
