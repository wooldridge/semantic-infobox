      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mrs. Robinson threatens to reveal their affair to destroy any chance Benjamin has with Elaine; so Benjamin rashly decides he has to tell Elaine first. An upset Elaine returns to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="University of California, Berkeley">UC Berkeley</a>, refusing to speak with Benjamin. Benjamin decides he is going to marry Elaine and goes to Berkeley and stalks her. He contrives a meeting on a bus while she is on her way to a date with her classmate Carl. An angry Elaine later demands to know what he is doing in Berkeley after he raped her mother by taking advantage of her while she was drunk. Benjamin tells her it was her mother who seduced him, something Elaine does not want to hear, so Benjamin says he will go somewhere else. Elaine tells Benjamin not to leave until he has a definite plan. The next day, Elaine comes into Benjamin's apartment in the middle of the night and asks him to kiss her. The two hang out in Berkeley while Benjamin keeps pressing her to get blood tests so that they can get married. Elaine is unsure about this and says she has told Carl she might marry him.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mr. Robinson, who has found out everything about Benjamin's and his wife's affair, goes to Benjamin's apartment in Berkeley where he berates him for his adulterous role in the affair, in which Mr. Robinson is in the stages of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce" title="Divorce">divorce</a>. Mr. Robinson then threatens to have him prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law should Benjamin ever come near Elaine or even think of her again. He also forces her to drop out of school and takes her away to marry Carl. Benjamin is left with just a note from Elaine saying that she loves him but that her father is really angry and it can never work out. Benjamin races back to Pasadena looking for Elaine but finds Mrs. Robinson instead. She tells him he will not be able stop the wedding and calls the police. Benjamin heads back to Berkeley and finds out from Carl's Theta Delta Chi Fraternity brothers that the wedding is in Santa Barbara. He then speeds off towards Santa Barbara, stopping only at a gas station for directions to the church. Benjamin is in such a hurry that he rushes off without refueling.</p>

In a commentary audio released with the 40th anniversary DVD, Hoffman revealed that he was uneasy about the scene in which he pounds on the church window, as the owner of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_(building)" title="Church (building)">church</a> had been watching the filming disapprovingly.

By the time they were nearly finished editing the film, Simon had only written one new song. Nichols begged him for more but Simon, who was touring constantly, told him he didn't have the time. He did play him a few notes of a new song he had been working on; "It's not for the movie... it's a song about times pastÂ â€” about Mrs. Roosevelt and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_DiMaggio" title="Joe DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a> and stuff."
