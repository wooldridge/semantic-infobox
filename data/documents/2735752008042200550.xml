	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Marlon Brando, Jr.</b> (April 3, 1924 â€“ July 1, 2004) was an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_the_United_States" title="People of the United States">American</a> actor who performed for over half a century.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He was perhaps best known for his Academy Award-winning performance as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vito_Corleone" title="Vito Corleone">Vito Corleone</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola" title="Francis Ford Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></i> (1972) and for his roles as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kowalski" title="Stanley Kowalski">Stanley Kowalski</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_(1951_film)" title="A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)">A Streetcar Named Desire</a></i> (1951) and his Academy Award-winning performance as Terry Malloy in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Waterfront" title="On the Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a></i> (1954), both directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elia_Kazan" title="Elia Kazan">Elia Kazan</a>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando had a significant impact on film acting. He was the foremost example of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_acting" title="Method acting">"method" acting</a> style, and became notorious for his "mumbling" diction, but his mercurial performances were highly regarded and he is now considered one of the greatest American film actors of the twentieth century. Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> said of him, "He is the marker. There's 'before Brando' and 'after Brando'.'" Actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a> once said, "When Marlon dies, everybody moves up one."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando was also an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activism" title="Activism">activist</a>, supporting many issues, notably the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955%E2%80%931968)" title="African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955â€“1968)">American Civil Rights</a> and various <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Movement" title="American Indian Movement">American Indian Movements</a>.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marlon Brando was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska" title="Omaha, Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando,_Sr." title="Marlon Brando, Sr.">Marlon Brando, Sr.</a>, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide" title="Pesticide">pesticide</a> and chemical feed manufacturer, and his wife, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodie_Brando" title="Dodie Brando">Dorothy Julia (nÃ©e Pennebaker)</a>. His parents moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanston,_Illinois" title="Evanston, Illinois">Evanston, Illinois</a>, but separated when he was eleven years old. His mother took her three children: <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocelyn_Brando" title="Jocelyn Brando">Jocelyn</a> (1919â€“2005), Frances (1922â€“1994) and Marlon, to live with her mother in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Ana,_California" title="Santa Ana, California">Santa Ana, California</a>. In 1937, Brando's parents reconciled and moved together to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertyville,_Illinois" title="Libertyville, Illinois">Libertyville, Illinois</a>, north of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando's family was of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_people" title="German people">German</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_people" title="Dutch people">Dutch</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people" title="Irish people">Irish</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_people" title="English people">English</a> ancestry. His direct male ancestor Johann Wilhelm Brandau emigrated to New Amsterdam in the 17th century from Pfalz, Germany (contrary to some biographies, Brando's grandfather Eugene E. Brando was not French but was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>.) Brando was raised a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Christ,_Scientist" title="Church of Christ, Scientist">Christian Scientist</a>. His grandmother Marie Holloway abandoned her family when Marlon Brando, Sr., was five years old. She used the money Eugene sent her to support her gambling and alcoholism.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marlon Brando, Sr., was a talented amateur photographer. His wife, known as Dodie, was unconventional but talented, having been an actress. She smoked, wore <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trousers" title="Trousers">trousers</a>, and drove cars, unusual for women at the time. However, she was an alcoholic and often had to be brought home from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> bars by her husband; she finally joined <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous" title="Alcoholics Anonymous">Alcoholics Anonymous</a>. Dodie Brando acted and was a theater administrator. She helped <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a> to begin his acting career, and fueled her son Marlon's interest in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre" title="Theatre">stage acting</a>. However, Brando was closer to his maternal grandmother, Bessie Gahan Pennebaker Meyers, than to his own mother. Widowed while still young, Bessie Meyers worked as a secretary and later as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Science" title="Christian Science">Christian Science</a> healer. Her father, Myles Gahan, was a doctor from Ireland; her mother, Julia Watts, was from England.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Marlon Brando was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imitation" title="Imitation">mimic</a> from early childhood and developed an ability to absorb the mannerisms of people he played and display them dramatically while staying in character. His sister <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocelyn_Brando" title="Jocelyn Brando">Jocelyn Brando</a> was the first to pursue an acting career, going to study at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Dramatic_Art" title="American Academy of Dramatic Art">American Academy of Dramatic Art</a>. She appeared on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a>, then movies and television. Brando's sister Frances left college in California to study art in New York. Brando soon followed her.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando had been held back a year in school and was later <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_(academia)#Famous_Expulsions" title="Expulsion (academia)">expelled</a> from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertyville_High_School" title="Libertyville High School">Libertyville High School</a> for riding his motorcycle through the corridors. He was sent to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shattuck_Military_Academy" title="Shattuck Military Academy">Shattuck Military Academy</a>, where his father had studied before him. Brando excelled at theatre and did well in the school. In his final year (1943), however, he was put on probation for talking back to a student officer during maneuvers. He was confined to the campus, but tried going into town, and was caught. The faculty voted to expel him, though he was supported by the students, who thought expulsion was too harsh. He was invited back for the following year, but decided instead to drop out of high school.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando worked as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditch" title="Ditch">ditch</a>-digger as a summer job arranged by his father. He then decided to follow his sisters to New York. His father supported him for six months, then offered to help him find a job as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales" title="Sales">salesman</a>. However, Brando left to study at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Theatre_Wing" title="American Theatre Wing">American Theatre Wing Professional School</a>, part of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_Workshop" title="Dramatic Workshop">Dramatic Workshop</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_School" title="The New School">The New School</a> with the influential German director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Piscator" title="Erwin Piscator">Erwin Piscator</a> and at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actors%27_Studio" title="Actors' Studio">Actors' Studio</a>. He also studied with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stella_Adler" title="Stella Adler">Stella Adler</a> and learned the techniques of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislavski_System" title="Stanislavski System">Stanislavski System</a>. There is a story in which Adler spoke about teaching Brando, saying that she had instructed the class to act like chickens, then adding that a bomb was about to fall on them. Most of the class clucked and ran around wildly, but Brando sat calmly and pretended to lay an egg.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando used his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislavski_System" title="Stanislavski System">Stanislavski System</a> skills for his first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer-stock" title="Summer-stock">summer-stock</a> roles in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayville,_New_York" title="Sayville, New York">Sayville, New York</a> on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island" title="Long Island">Long Island</a>. His behavior got him kicked out of the cast of the New School's production in Sayville, but he was discovered in a locally produced play there and then made it to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> in the bittersweet drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Remember_Mama" title="I Remember Mama">I Remember Mama</a></i> in 1944. Critics voted him "Broadway's Most Promising Actor" for his role as an anguished veteran in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truckline_Cafe" title="Truckline Cafe">Truckline CafÃ©</a></i>, although the play was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure" title="Failure">commercial failure</a>. In 1946 he appeared on Broadway as the young hero in the political drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Flag_is_Born" title="A Flag is Born">A Flag is Born</a></i>, refusing to accept wages above the Actor's Equity rate because of his commitment to the cause of Israeli independence. In that same year, Brando played the role of Marchbanks with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Cornell" title="Katharine Cornell">Katharine Cornell</a> in her production's revival of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candida_(play)" title="Candida (play)">Candida</a>, one of her signature roles. Brando achieved stardom, however, as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kowalski" title="Stanley Kowalski">Stanley Kowalski</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" title="Tennessee Williams">Tennessee Williams</a>'s 1947 play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_(play)" title="A Streetcar Named Desire (play)">A Streetcar Named Desire</a>,</i> directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elia_Kazan" title="Elia Kazan">Elia Kazan</a>. Brando sought out that role, driving out to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provincetown,_Massachusetts" title="Provincetown, Massachusetts">Provincetown, Massachusetts</a>, where Williams was spending the summer, to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audition" title="Audition">audition</a> for the part. Williams recalled that he opened the screen door and knew, instantly, that he had his Stanley Kowalski. Brando's performance revolutionized acting technique and set the model for the American form of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_acting" title="Method acting">method acting</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Afterward, Brando was asked to do a screen test for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Brothers</a> studio for the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Without_A_Cause" title="Rebel Without A Cause">Rebel Without A Cause</a></i>, which <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dean" title="James Dean">James Dean</a> was later cast in.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando's first screen role was as the bitter paraplegic veteran in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_(film)" title="The Men (film)">The Men</a></i> in 1950. True to his method, Brando spent a month in bed at a veterans' hospital to prepare for the role.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando brought his performance as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kowalski" title="Stanley Kowalski">Stanley Kowalski</a> to the screen in Kazan's adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" title="Tennessee Williams">Tennessee Williams</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_(play)" title="A Streetcar Named Desire (play)"><i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i></a>, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for that role, and again in each of the next three years for his roles in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_Zapata!" title="Viva Zapata!">Viva Zapata!</a></i> in 1952, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar_(1953_movie)" title="Julius Caesar (1953 movie)">Julius Caesar</a></i> in 1953 as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Antony" title="Mark Antony">Mark Antony</a>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Waterfront" title="On the Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a></i> in 1954. These first five films of his career established Brando, as evidenced in his winning the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Award_for_Best_Actor_in_a_Leading_Role" title="BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role">BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role</a> in three consecutive years, 1951 to 1953.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1953, Brando also starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_One" title="The Wild One">The Wild One</a></i> riding his own <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_Thunderbird" title="Triumph Thunderbird">Triumph Thunderbird</a> 6T motorcycle which caused consternation to Triumph's importers, as the subject matter was rowdy motorcycle gangs taking over a small town. But the images of Brando posing with his Triumph motorcycle became iconic, even forming the basis of his wax dummy at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_Tussauds" title="Madame Tussauds">Madame Tussauds</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Later that same year, Brando starred in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Falk" title="Lee Falk">Lee Falk</a>'s production of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw" title="George Bernard Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_and_the_Man" title="Arms and the Man">Arms and the Man</a></i> in Boston.

His Boston contract was less than $500 per week. It would be the last time he ever acted in a stage play.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando won the Oscar for his role of Terry Malloy in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Waterfront" title="On the Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a></i>. For the famous <i>I coulda' been a contender</i> scene, Brando convinced Kazan that the scripted scene was unrealistic, and with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Steiger" title="Rod Steiger">Rod Steiger</a>, improvised the final product.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando then took a variety of roles in the 1950s: as Sky Masterson in the musical <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guys_and_Dolls_(film)" title="Guys and Dolls (film)">Guys and Dolls</a></i>; as Sakini, a Japanese interpreter for the U.S. Army in postwar <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Teahouse_of_the_August_Moon_(film)" title="The Teahouse of the August Moon (film)">The Teahouse of the August Moon</a></i>; as a United States Air Force officer in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayonara" title="Sayonara">Sayonara</a></i>, and a Nazi officer in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Young_Lions" title="The Young Lions">The Young Lions</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 1960s, Brando starred in films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutiny_on_the_Bounty_(1962_film)" title="Mutiny on the Bounty (1962 film)">Mutiny on the Bounty</a></i> (1962); <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-Eyed_Jacks" title="One-Eyed Jacks">One-Eyed Jacks</a></i> (1961), a western that would be the only film Brando would ever direct; <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chase_(1966_film)" title="The Chase (1966 film)">The Chase</a></i> (1966), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflections_in_a_Golden_Eye_(film)" title="Reflections in a Golden Eye (film)">Reflections in a Golden Eye</a></i> (1967), portraying a repressed gay army officer. It was the type of performance that later led critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Crouch" title="Stanley Crouch">Stanley Crouch</a> to write, "Brando's main achievement was to portray the taciturn but stoic gloom of those pulverized by circumstances." He also played a guru in the sex farce <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_(1968_film)" title="Candy (1968 film)">Candy</a></i> (1968). <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn!" title="Burn!">Burn!</a></i> (1969), which Brando would later claim as his personal favorite, was a commercial failure. His career slowed down by the end of the decade as he gained a reputation for being difficult to work with.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando's performance as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vito_Corleone" title="Vito Corleone">Vito Corleone</a> in 1972's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></i> was a mid-career turning point. Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola" title="Francis Ford Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a> convinced Brando to submit to a "make-up" test, in which Brando did his own makeup (he used cotton balls to simulate the puffed-cheek look). Coppola was electrified by Brando's characterization as the head of a crime family, but had to fight the studio in order to cast the temperamental Brando. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Puzo" title="Mario Puzo">Mario Puzo</a> always imagined Brando as Corleone. However, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount</a> studio heads wanted to give the role to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Thomas" title="Danny Thomas">Danny Thomas</a> in the hope that Thomas would have his own production company throw in its lot with Paramount. Thomas declined the role and actually urged the studio to cast Brando at the behest of Coppola and others who had witnessed the screen test.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eventually, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bluhdorn" title="Charles Bluhdorn">Charles Bluhdorn</a>, the president of Paramount parent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_%2B_Western" title="Gulf + Western">Gulf + Western</a>, was won over to letting Brando have the role; when he saw the screen test, he asked in amazement, "What are we watching? Who is this old guinea?"</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a> for his performance, but turned down the Oscar, becoming the second actor to refuse a Best Actor award (the first being <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Scott" title="George C.

Brando boycotted the award ceremony, sending instead American Indian Rights activist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacheen_Littlefeather" title="Sacheen Littlefeather">Sacheen Littlefeather</a>, who appeared in full Apache dress, to state Brando's reasons, which were based on his objection to the depiction of American Indians by Hollywood and television.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The actor followed with one of his greatest performances in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardo_Bertolucci" title="Bernardo Bertolucci">Bernardo Bertolucci</a>'s 1973 film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Tango_in_Paris" title="Last Tango in Paris">Last Tango in Paris</a></i>, but the performance was overshadowed by an uproar over the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotic" title="Erotic">erotic</a> nature of the film. Despite the controversy which attended both the film and the man, the Academy once again nominated Brando for the Best Actor.</p>

However, rewrites were made to the script when Brando refused to show up to the studio on the single day of shooting due to disputes with the studio.</p>

He agreed to the role only on assurance that he would be paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part, that he would not have to read the script beforehand and his lines would be displayed somewhere off-camera. It was revealed in a documentary contained in the 2001 DVD release of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(film)" title="Superman (film)">Superman</a></i>, that he was paid $3.7 million for just two weeks of work.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite announcing his retirement from acting in 1980, he subsequently gave interesting supporting performances in movies such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dry_White_Season" title="A Dry White Season">A Dry White Season</a></i> (for which he was again nominated for an Oscar in 1989), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Freshman_(1990_film)" title="The Freshman (1990 film)">The Freshman</a></i> in 1990 and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Juan_DeMarco" title="Don Juan DeMarco">Don Juan DeMarco</a></i> in 1995.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando conceived the idea of a novel called <i>Fan-Tan</i> with director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Cammell" title="Donald Cammell">Donald Cammell</a> in 1979, which was not released until 2005.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2004, Brando signed with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian" title="Tunisian">Tunisian</a> film director Ridha Behion and began pre-production on a project to be titled <i>Brando and Brando</i>. Up to a week before his death, Brando was working on the script in anticipation of a July/August 2004 start date. Production was suspended in July 2004 following Brando's death, at which time Behi stated that he would continue the film as an homage to Brando, with a new title of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Brando" title="Citizen Brando">Citizen Brando</a></i>.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando became well known for his crusades for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a>, Native American rights, and other political causes. He also earned a "bad boy" reputation for his public outbursts and antics. On June 12, 1973, Brando broke <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi" title="Paparazzi">paparazzo</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Galella" title="Ron Galella">Ron Galella</a>'s jaw.

He reportedly paid a $40,000 out-of-court settlement and suffered an infected hand as a result. Galella wore a football helmet the next time he photographed Brando at a gala benefiting the American Indians Development Association.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <i>Songs My Mother Taught Me</i>, Brando claimed he met <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> at a party as she played piano, unnoticed by anybody else there, and they had an affair and maintained an intermittent relationship for many years, receiving a telephone call from her several days before she died. He also claimed numerous other romances, although he did not discuss his marriages, his wives, or his children in his autobiography.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando married actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Kashfi" title="Anna Kashfi">Anna Kashfi</a> in 1957. Kashfi was born in Calcutta and moved to Wales at the end of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj" title="British Raj">British rule in India</a> in 1947. She is said to have been the daughter of a Welsh steel worker of Irish descent, William O'Callaghan, who had been superintendent on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Railways" title="Indian Railways">Indian State railways</a>. However, in her book, <i>Brando for Breakfast</i>, she claimed that she really is half Indian and that the press incorrectly thought that her stepfather, O'Callaghan, was her real father. She said her real father was Indian and that she was the result of an "unregistered alliance" between her parents. In 1959, Brando and Kashfi divorced after the birth of their son, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Brando" title="Christian Brando">Christian Brando</a>, on May 11, 1958.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1960, Brando married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movita_Castaneda" title="Movita Castaneda">Movita Castaneda</a>, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_people" title="Mexican people">Mexican</a> actress seven years his senior; they were divorced in 1962.

Brando's behavior during the filming of <i>Bounty</i> seemed to bolster his reputation as a difficult star. He was blamed for a change in director and a runaway budget, though he disclaimed responsibility for either.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <i>Bounty</i> experience affected Brando's life in a profound way. He fell in love with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahiti" title="Tahiti">Tahiti</a> and its people. He bought a twelve-island atoll, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetiaroa" title="Tetiaroa">Tetiaroa</a>, which he intended to make partly an environmental laboratory and partly a resort. Tahitian beauty <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarita_Teriipia" title="Tarita Teriipia">Tarita Teriipia</a>, who played Fletcher Christian's love interest, became Brando's third wife on August 10, 1962. She was 20 years old, 18 years younger than Brando. A 1961 article on Teriipia in the fan magazine <i>Motion Picture</i> described Brando's delight at how naÃ¯ve and unsophisticated she was. Because Teriipia was a native <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language" title="French language">French</a> speaker, Brando became fluent in the language and gave numerous interviews in French. Teriipia became the mother of two of his children. They divorced in July 1972. Brando eventually had a hotel built on Tetiaroa. It went through many redesigns as a result of changes demanded by Brando over the years. It is now closed. A new hotel, consisting of thirty deluxe villas, was planned.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an interview with Gary Carey, for his 1976 biography <i>The Only Contender</i>, Brando said, "Homosexuality is so much in fashion it no longer makes news. Like a large number of men, I, too, have had homosexual experiences and I am not ashamed. I have never paid much attention to what people think about me. But if there is someone who is convinced that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a> and I are lovers, may they continue to do so. I find it amusing." On his death, his ashes were mingled with those of his childhood friend and rumored (but never proven) lover Wally Cox, which Brando had kept with him since 1973, and were scattered in Tahiti and Death Valley.</p>

He commented softly to members of the Drollet family: "I'm sorry... If I could trade places with Dag, I would. I'm prepared for the consequences." Afterward, Drollet's father said he thought Brando was acting and his son was "getting away with murder".

He also earned a reputation for being difficult on the set, often unwilling or unable to memorize his lines and less interested in taking direction than in confronting the film director with odd demands. On the other hand, most other actors found him generous, funny, and supportive.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando also dabbled with some innovation in his last years.

He had a 24-hour chef, 24-hour security, 24-hour help, 24-hour kitchen, 24-hour maid service."

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1946, Brando showed his dedication to the Jewish desire for a homeland by performing in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hecht" title="Ben Hecht">Ben Hecht</a>'s Zionist play "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Flag_is_Born" title="A Flag is Born">A Flag is Born</a>".

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In August 1963, Brando participated in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington" title="March on Washington">March on Washington</a> along with fellow celebrities <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Belafonte" title="Harry Belafonte">Harry Belafonte</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Garner" title="James Garner">James Garner</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlton_Heston" title="Charlton Heston">Charlton Heston</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Lancaster" title="Burt Lancaster">Burt Lancaster</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Poitier" title="Sidney Poitier">Sidney Poitier</a>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the aftermath of the 1968 slaying of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Brando made one of the strongest commitments to furthering Dr. King's work. Shortly after Dr. King's death, Brando announced that he was bowing out of the lead role of a major film (<i>The Arrangement</i>) which was about to begin production, in order to devote himself to the civil rights movement. "I felt Iâ€™d better go find out where it is; what it is to be black in this country; what this rage is all about", Brando said on the late night ABC-TV <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joey_Bishop_Show_(talk_show)" title="The Joey Bishop Show (talk show)">Joey Bishop Show</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The actor's participation in the African-American civil rights movement actually began well before King's death. In the early 1960s Brando contributed thousands of dollars to both the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (S.C.L.C.) and to a scholarship fund established for the children of slain Mississippi N.A.A.C.P. leader Medgar Evers. By this time, Brando was already involved in films that carried messages about human rights: "Sayonara", which addressed interracial romance, and "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ugly_American" title="The Ugly American">The Ugly American</a>", depicting the conduct of US officials abroad and its deleterious effect on the citizens of foreign countries. For a time Brando was also donating money to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_Party" title="Black Panther Party">Black Panther Party</a> and considered himself a friend of founder <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Seale" title="Bobby Seale">Bobby Seale</a>. However, Brando ended his financial support for the group over his perception of its increasing radicalization, specifically a passage in a Panther pamphlet put out by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldridge_Cleaver" title="Eldridge Cleaver">Eldridge Cleaver</a> advocating indiscriminate violence, "for the Revolution".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the 1973 Academy Awards ceremony, Brando refused to accept the Oscar for his performance in The Godfather. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacheen_Littlefeather" title="Sacheen Littlefeather">Sacheen Littlefeather</a> represented Mr. Brando at the ceremony. She appeared in full Apache clothing. She stated that owing to the "poor treatment of Native Americans in the film industry" Mr. Brando would not accept the award. At this time the 1973 standoff at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_incident" title="Wounded Knee incident">Wounded Knee</a> occurred, causing rising tensions between the government and Native American activists. The event grabbed the attention of the US and the world media. This was considered a major event and victory for the movement by its supporters and participants.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an interview in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy" title="Playboy">Playboy</a></i> magazine in January 1979, Brando said: "You've seen every single race besmirched, but you never saw an image of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kike" title="Kike">kike</a> because the Jews were ever so watchful for thatâ€”and rightly so. They never allowed it to be shown on screen. The Jews have done so much for the world that, I suppose, you get extra disappointed because they didn't pay attention to that."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando made a similar allegation on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_King_Live" title="Larry King Live">Larry King Live</a></i> in April 1996, saying "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States" title="Cinema of the United States">Hollywood</a> is run by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew" title="Jew">Jews</a>; it is owned by Jews, and they should have a greater sensitivity about the issue ofâ€”of people who are suffering.

Because they knew perfectly well, that that is where you draw the wagons around." King, who is Jewish, replied, "When you sayâ€”when you say something like that you are playing right in, though, to anti-Semitic people who say the Jews areâ€”" at which point Brando interrupted. "No, no, because I will be the first one who will appraise the Jews honestly and say 'Thank God for the Jews.'"</p>
