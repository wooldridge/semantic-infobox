	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Ingrid Bergman</b> (29 August 1915 â€“ 29 August 1982) was a Swedish actress who starred in a variety of European and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_films" title="American films">American films</a>. She won three <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Awards</a>, two <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Awards</a>, and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award" title="Tony Award">Tony Award</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Performance_by_a_Leading_Actress_in_a_Play" title="Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play">Best Actress</a>. She is ranked as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years..._100_Stars" title="AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars">fourth greatest female star</a> of American cinema of all time by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a>. She is best remembered for her role as Ilsa Lund in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)" title="Casablanca (film)">Casablanca</a></i> (1942), a World War II drama co-starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart" title="Humphrey Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before becoming a star in American films, she had already been a leading actress in Swedish, French, German, Italian, and British films. Her first introduction to American audiences came with her starring role in the English remake of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermezzo_(1939_film)" title="Intermezzo (1939 film)"><i>Intermezzo</i></a> in 1939. In America, she brought to the screen a "Nordic freshness and vitality", along with extreme beauty and intelligence, and according to the <i>St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture</i>, she quickly became "the ideal of American womanhood" and one of Hollywood's greatest leading actresses.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Her producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Selznick" title="David O. Selznick">David O. Selznick</a>, who called her "the most completely conscientious actress" he had ever worked with, gave her a seven-year acting contract, thereby assuring her continual stardom. A few of her other starring roles, besides <i>Casablanca</i>, included <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls_(film)" title="For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)"><i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i></a> (1943), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslight_(1944_film)" title="Gaslight (1944 film)"><i>Gaslight</i></a> (1944), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bells_of_St._Mary%27s" title="The Bells of St. Mary's">The Bells of St. Mary's</a></i> (1945), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellbound_(1945_film)" title="Spellbound (1945 film)"><i>Spellbound</i></a> (1945), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notorious_(1946_film)" title="Notorious (1946 film)"><i>Notorious</i></a> (1946), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_Capricorn" title="Under Capricorn">Under Capricorn</a></i> (1949), and the independent production, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Arc_(1948_film)" title="Joan of Arc (1948 film)"><i>Joan of Arc</i></a> (1948).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1950, after a decade of stardom in American films, she starred in the Italian film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromboli_(film)" title="Stromboli (film)">Stromboli</a></i>, which led to a love affair with director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Rossellini" title="Roberto Rossellini">Roberto Rossellini</a> while they were both already married. The affair created a scandal that forced her to return to Europe until 1956, when she made a successful Hollywood comeback in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia_(film)" title="Anastasia (film)"><i>Anastasia</i></a>, for which she won her second Academy Award, as well as the forgiveness of her fans. Many of her personal and film documents can be seen in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesleyan_University" title="Wesleyan University">Wesleyan University</a> Cinema Archives.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_years:_1915.E2.80.931938">Early years: 1915â€“1938</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bergman, named after <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingrid_of_Sweden" title="Ingrid of Sweden">Princess Ingrid of Sweden</a>, was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, Sweden on 29 August 1915 to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_people" title="Swedish people">Swedish</a> father, Justus Samuel Bergman, and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans" title="Germans">German</a> mother, Friedel Adler Bergman. When she was three years of age, her mother died. Her father, who was an artist and photographer, died when she was thirteen. In the years before he died, he wanted her to become an opera star, and had her take voice lessons for three years. But she always "knew from the beginning that she wanted to be an actress", sometimes wearing her mother's clothes and staging plays in her father's empty studio. Her father documented all her birthdays with a borrowed camera.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After his death, she was then sent to live with an aunt, who died of heart complications only six months later. She then moved in with her aunt Hulda and uncle Otto, who had five children. Another aunt she visited, Elsa Adler, first told Ingrid, when she was 11, that her mother may have "some Jewish blood", and that her father was aware of that fact long before they married. But her aunt also cautioned her about telling others about her Jewishness as "there might be some difficult times coming."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the age of 17, Bergman was allowed only one chance to become an actress by entering an acting competition with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dramatic_Theatre" title="Royal Dramatic Theatre">Royal Dramatic Theatre</a> in Stockholm. Bergman recalls her feelings during that competition:</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a result she received a scholarship to the state-sponsored <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dramatic_Theatre_School" title="Royal Dramatic Theatre School">Royal Dramatic Theatre School</a>, where <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Garbo" title="Greta Garbo">Greta Garbo</a> had years earlier also earned a similar scholarship. After a few months she was given a part in a new play, <i>Ett Brott</i> (A Crime), by Sigfrid Siwertz. Yet, this was "totally against procedure" at the school, notes Chandler, where girls were expected to complete three years of study before getting such acting roles. During her first summer break, she was also hired by a Swedish film studio, which consequently led to her leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre to work in films full time, after just one year. Her first film role after leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre was a small part in 1935's <i>Munkbrogreven</i> (She had previously been an extra in the 1932 film <i>Landskamp</i>). She later acted in a dozen films in Sweden, including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_kvinnas_ansikte" title="En kvinnas ansikte">En kvinnas ansikte</a></i>, which was later remade as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Woman%27s_Face" title="A Woman's Face">A Woman's Face</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Crawford" title="Joan Crawford">Joan Crawford</a>, and one film in Germany, <i>Die vier Gesellen</i> ("The Four Companions") (1938).</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Hollywood_period:_1939.E2.80.931949">Hollywood period: 1939â€“1949</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bergman's first acting role in America came when <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Selznick" title="David O. Selznick">David O. Selznick</a> brought her to America to star in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermezzo_(1939_film)" title="Intermezzo (1939 film)"><i>Intermezzo: A Love Story</i></a>, an English language remake of her 1936 Swedish film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermezzo_(1936_film)" title="Intermezzo (1936 film)">Intermezzo</a></i>. Unable to speak English and uncertain about her acceptance by the American audience, she expected to complete this one film and return home to Sweden. Her husband, Petter, remained in Sweden with their daughter Pia. In the film she played the role of a young piano accompanist opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Howard_(actor)" title="Leslie Howard (actor)">Leslie Howard</a> as a famous violin virtuoso.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She arrived in Los Angeles on 6 May 1939, and stayed at the Selznick home until she could find another residence. According to David Selznick's son Danny, who was a child at the time, his father had a few concerns about Ingrid: "She didn't speak English, she was too tall, her name sounded too German, and her eyebrows were too thick." However, Bergman was soon accepted without having to modify her looks or name, despite some early suggestions by Selznick. "He let her have her way", notes a story in <i>Life Magazine</i>. Selznick understood her fear of Hollywood make-up artists, who might turn her into someone she wouldn't recognize, and "instructed them to lay off." He was also aware that her natural good looks would compete successfully with Hollywood's "synthetic razzle-dazzle."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the weeks following, while <i>Intermezzo</i> was being filmed, Selznick was also filming <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_With_the_Wind_(film)" title="Gone With the Wind (film)"><i>Gone with the Wind</i></a>. In a letter to William Herbert, his publicity director, Selznick described a few of his early impressions of Bergman:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Intermezzo</i> became an enormous success and as a result Bergman became a star. The film's director, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Ratoff" title="Gregory Ratoff">Gregory Ratoff</a>, said "She is sensational", as an actress. This was the "sentiment of the entire set", writes <i>Life</i>, adding that workmen would go out of their way to do things for her, and the cast and crew "admired the quick, alert concentration she gave to direction and to her lines." Film historian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Thomson_(film_critic)" title="David Thomson (film critic)">David Thomson</a> notes that this would become "the start of an astonishing impact on Hollywood and America" where her lack of makeup contributed to an "air of nobility." According to <i>Life</i>, the impression that she left on Hollywood, after she returned to Sweden, was of a tall (5Â ft. 9 in.) girl "with light brown hair and blue eyes who was painfully shy but friendly, with a warm, straight, quick smile." Selznick appreciated her uniqueness, and with his wife <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_Selznick" title="Irene Selznick">Irene</a>, they remained important friends throughout her career.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After Germany initiated World War II, Bergman "felt guilty because she had so misjudged the situation in Germany" while she was there filming <i>Die vier Gesellen</i> (The Four Companions). According to one of her biographers, Charlotte Chandler (2007), she had at first considered the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi" title="Nazi">Nazis</a> only a "temporary aberration, 'too foolish to be taken seriously.' She believed Germany would not start a war." Bergman felt that "The good people there would not permit it." Chandler adds, "Ingrid felt guilty all the rest of her life because when she was in Germany at the end of the war, she had been afraid to go with the others to witness the atrocities of the Nazi extermination camps."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After completing one last film in Sweden and appearing in three moderately successful films (which included <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Had_Four_Sons" title="Adam Had Four Sons">Adam Had Four Sons</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_in_Heaven" title="Rage in Heaven">Rage in Heaven</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Jekyll_and_Mr._Hyde" title="Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a></i>) in the United States, Bergman co-starred with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart" title="Humphrey Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a> in the 1942 classic film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)" title="Casablanca (film)">Casablanca</a></i>, which remains her best-known role. In this film, she played the role of Ilsa, the beautiful Norwegian wife of Victor Laszlo, played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Henreid" title="Paul Henreid">Paul Henreid</a>, an "anti-Nazi underground hero" who is in Casablanca, a safe-haven from the Nazis. Bergman did not consider <i>Casablanca</i> to be one of her favorite performances. <i>"I made so many films which were more important, but the only one people ever want to talk about is that one with Bogart."</i> In later years however, she stated, "I feel about <i>Casablanca</i> that it has a life of its own. There is something mystical about it. It seems to have filled a need, a need that was there before the film, a need that the film filled."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After <i>Casablanca</i>, with "Selznick's steady boosting", she played the part of Maria in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls_(film)" title="For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a></i> (1943), which was also her first color film. For the role she received her first Academy Award nomination for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Best Actress</a>. The film was taken from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway" title="Ernest Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>'s novel of the same title. When the book was sold to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>, Hemingway stated that "Miss Bergman, and no one else should play the part." His opinion came from seeing her in her first American role, <i>Intermezzo</i>, although he hadn't yet met her. A few weeks later, they did meet, and after studying her said "You <i>are</i> Maria!"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following year, she won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslight_(1944_film)" title="Gaslight (1944 film)">Gaslight</a></i> (1944), a film in which <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cukor" title="George Cukor">George Cukor</a> directed her as a "wife driven close to madness" by co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Boyer" title="Charles Boyer">Charles Boyer</a>. The film, according to Thomson, "was the peak of her Hollywood glory." Bergman next played a nun in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bells_of_St._Mary%27s" title="The Bells of St. Mary's">The Bells of St. Mary's</a></i> (1945) opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Crosby" title="Bing Crosby">Bing Crosby</a>, for which she received her third consecutive nomination for Best Actress.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bergman starred in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> films <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellbound_(1945_film)" title="Spellbound (1945 film)">Spellbound</a></i> (1945), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notorious_(1946_film)" title="Notorious (1946 film)">Notorious</a></i> (1946), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_Capricorn" title="Under Capricorn">Under Capricorn</a></i> (1949). Unlike her earlier Hitchcock films, <i>Under Capricorn</i>, the only one of the three made in color, was a slow-paced costume drama, and has never received the acclaim that the other films that Bergman made with Hitchcock have. Bergman was a student of the acting coach <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chekhov" title="Michael Chekhov">Michael Chekhov</a> during the 1940s. Coincidentally, it was for his role in <i>Spellbound</i> that Chekhov received his only Academy Award nomination.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Later, Bergman received another Best Actress nomination for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Arc_(1948_film)" title="Joan of Arc (1948 film)">Joan of Arc</a></i> (1948), an independent film based on the Maxwell Anderson play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Lorraine" title="Joan of Lorraine">Joan of Lorraine</a></i>, produced by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Wanger" title="Walter Wanger">Walter Wanger</a>, and initially released through <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO" title="RKO">RKO</a>. Bergman had championed the role since her arrival in Hollywood, which was one of the reasons she had played it on the Broadway stage in Anderson's play. The film was not a big hit with the public, partly because of the scandal of Bergman's affair with Italian film director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Rossellini" title="Roberto Rossellini">Roberto Rossellini</a>, which broke while the film was still in theaters. Even worse, it received disastrous reviews, and although nominated for several Academy Awards, did not receive a Best Picture nomination. It was subsequently shorn of 45 minutes, and it was not until its restoration to full length in 1998 and its 2004 appearance on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a> that later audiences could see it as it was intended to be shown.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between motion pictures, Bergman appeared in the stage plays <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liliom" title="Liliom">Liliom</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Christie" title="Anna Christie">Anna Christie</a></i>, and <i>Joan of Lorraine</i>. Furthermore, during a press conference in Washington, D.C. for the promotion of <i>Joan of Lorraine</i>, she protested against segregation after seeing it first hand at the theater she was acting in. This led to a lot of publicity and some hate mail.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bergman went to Alaska during World War II to entertain American troops. Soon after the war ended, she also went to Europe for the same purpose, where she was able to see the devastation caused by the war. It was during this time that she began a relationship with the famous photographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Capa" title="Robert Capa">Robert Capa</a>. She became a smoker after needing to smoke for her role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_of_Triumph_(1948_film)" title="Arch of Triumph (1948 film)">Arch of Triumph</a></i>.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1937, at the age of 21, Bergman married dentist Petter LindstrÃ¶m, and a year and a half later had a daughter, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pia_Lindstr%C3%B6m" title="Pia LindstrÃ¶m">Pia LindstrÃ¶m</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After returning to America in 1940, she acted on Broadway before continuing to do films in Hollywood. The following year, her husband arrived from Sweden with daughter Pia. Lindstrom stayed in Rochester, New York, where he studied medicine and surgery at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Rochester" title="University of Rochester">University of Rochester</a>. Bergman would travel to New York and stay at their small rented stucco house between films, her visits lasting from a few days to four months.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to a <i>Life</i> magazine article, the "doctor regards himself as the undisputed head of the family, an idea that Ingrid accepts cheerfully." He also insists that she draw the line between her film and personal life, as he has a "professional dislike for being associated with the tinseled glamor of Hollywood." He later moved to San Francisco, California, where he completed his internship at a private hospital, and they continued to spend time together when she could travel between filmings.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bergman strongly admired two films by Italian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director" title="Film director">director</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Rossellini" title="Roberto Rossellini">Roberto Rossellini</a> that she had seen in the United States. In 1949, Bergman wrote to Rossellini, expressing this admiration and suggesting that she make a film with him. This led to her being cast in his film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromboli_(film)" title="Stromboli (film)">Stromboli</a></i> (1950). During production, Bergman fell in love with Rossellini, and they began an affair. Bergman became pregnant with Rossellini's son, Renato Roberto Giusto Giuseppe ("Robin") Rossellini (born 2 February 1950).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This affair caused a huge scandal in the United States, where it even led to Bergman being denounced on the floor of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate" title="United States Senate">U.S. Senate</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sullivan" title="Ed Sullivan">Ed Sullivan</a> choosing not to have her on his show, despite a poll indicating that the public wanted her to appear. However, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Allen" title="Steve Allen">Steve Allen</a>, whose show was equally popular, did have her on, later explaining "the danger of trying to judge artistic activity through the prism of one's personal life." Spoto notes that Bergman had, by virtue of her roles and screen persona, placed herself "above all that." She had played a nun in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bells_of_St._Mary%27s" title="The Bells of St. Mary's">The Bells of St. Mary's</a></i> (1945) and a saint in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Arc_(1948_film)" title="Joan of Arc (1948 film)">Joan of Arc</a></i> (1948), and Bergman herself later acknowledged, "People saw me in <i>Joan of Arc</i> and declared me a saint. I'm not. I'm just a woman, another human being."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a result of the scandal, Bergman returned to Italy, leaving her husband and daughter, which led to a publicized divorce and custody battle for their daughter. Bergman and Rossellini were married on 24 May 1950. In addition to Renato, they had twin daughters (born 18 June 1952): <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Rossellini" title="Isabella Rossellini">Isabella Rossellini</a>, an actress and model, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingrid_Rossellini" title="Ingrid Rossellini">Isotta Ingrid Rossellini</a>, a professor of Italian literature.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rossellini completed five films starring Bergman between 1949 and 1955: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromboli" title="Stromboli">Stromboli</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_%2751" title="Europa '51">Europa '51</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viaggio_in_Italia" title="Viaggio in Italia">Viaggio in Italia</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanna_d%27Arco_al_rogo" title="Giovanna d'Arco al rogo">Giovanna d'Arco al rogo</a></i>, and <i>La paura</i>. He also directed her in a brief segment of his 1953 documentary film, <i>Siamo donne</i> (We, the Women), which was devoted to film actresses. Rossellini biographer Peter Bondanella notes that problems with communication during their marriage may have inspired his films' central themes of "solitude, grace, and spirituality in a world without moral values."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, Rossellini's use of a Hollywood star in his typically "neorealist" films, in which he normally used non-professional actors, did provoke negative reactions in some circles. Bondanella speculates that this change may have been intentional: he may have "intended to provoke a significant change in direction within Italian cinema." In <i>Stromboli</i>, Bergman's first film with Rossellini, her character was "defying audience expectations" in that Rossellini preferred to work without a script. This forced Bergman to act most of her scenes "inspired by reality while she worked", a style which Bondanella calls "a new cinema of psychological introspection." She was aware of his directing style before filming however, as Rossellini had earlier written her explaining that he worked from "a few basic ideas, developing them little by little" as a film progressed.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After separating from Rossellini, Bergman starred in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Renoir" title="Jean Renoir">Jean Renoir</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_and_Her_Men" title="Elena and Her Men">Elena and Her Men</a></i> (<i>Elena et les Hommes</i>, 1956), a romantic comedy where she played a Polish princess caught in political intrigue. Although the film wasn't a success, it has since come to be regarded as one of her best performances.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With her starring role in 1956's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia_(1956_film)" title="Anastasia (1956 film)">Anastasia</a></i>, Bergman made a triumphant return to the American screen and won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> for a second time. The award was accepted for her by her friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant" title="Cary Grant">Cary Grant</a>. Bergman would not make her first post-scandal public appearance in Hollywood until the 1958 Academy Awards, when she was the presenter of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>. Furthermore, after being introduced by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant" title="Cary Grant">Cary Grant</a> and walking out on stage to present, she was given a standing ovation.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bergman would continue to alternate between performances in American and European films for the rest of her career and also made occasional appearances in television dramas such as a 1959 production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turn_of_the_Screw" title="The Turn of the Screw">The Turn of the Screw</a></i> for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startime_(TV_series)" title="Startime (TV series)">Ford Startime</a></i> TV series for which she won an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Award</a> for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After a long hiatus, Bergman did the movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus_Flower" title="Cactus Flower">Cactus Flower</a></i> in 1968, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Matthau" title="Walter Matthau">Walter Matthau</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldie_Hawn" title="Goldie Hawn">Goldie Hawn</a>.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bergman became one of the elite actresses to receive three Oscars when she won her third (and first for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a>) for her performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_on_the_Orient_Express_(1974_film)" title="Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)">Murder on the Orient Express</a></i> (1974). Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Lumet" title="Sidney Lumet">Sidney Lumet</a> offered Bergman the important part of Princess Dragomiroff, with which he felt she could win an Oscar. However, she insisted on playing the much smaller role of Greta Ohlsson, the old Swedish missionary. Lumet discussed Bergman's role:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bergman could speak Swedish (her native language), German (her second language, learned in school), English (learned when brought over to United States), Italian (learned while living in Italy) and French (her third language, learned in school). In addition, she acted in each of these languages at various times. Fellow actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gielgud" title="John Gielgud">John Gielgud</a>, who had acted with her in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_on_the_Orient_Express_(1974_film)" title="Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)">Murder on the Orient Express</a></i> and who had directed her in the play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constant_Wife" title="The Constant Wife">The Constant Wife</a></i>, playfully mocked this ability when he remarked, "She speaks five languages and can't act in any of them."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although known chiefly as a film star, Bergman strongly admired the great English stage actors and their craft. She had the opportunity to appear in London's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre" title="West End theatre">West End</a>, working with such stage stars as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Michael_Redgrave" title="Sir Michael Redgrave">Sir Michael Redgrave</a> in <i>A Month in the Country</i> (1965), Sir John Gielgud in <i>The Constant Wife</i> (1973) and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_Wendy_Hiller" title="Dame Wendy Hiller">Dame Wendy Hiller</a> in <i>Waters of the Moon</i> (1977â€“78).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1978, Bergman played in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman" title="Ingmar Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn_Sonata" title="Autumn Sonata">Autumn Sonata</a></i> (<i>HÃ¶stsonaten</i>) for which she received her 7th Academy Award nomination and made her final performance on the big screen. In the film, Bergman plays a celebrity pianist who travels to Trondheim in Norway to visit her neglected daughter, played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liv_Ullmann" title="Liv Ullmann">Liv Ullmann</a>. The film was shot in Norway. It is considered by many to be among her best performances. She hosted the AFI's Life Achievement Award Ceremony for Alfred Hitchcock in 1979.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1982 she was offered the starring role in a television mini-series, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Woman_Called_Golda" title="A Woman Called Golda">A Woman Called Golda</a></i>, about the late <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israeli</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister" title="Prime minister">prime minister</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golda_Meir" title="Golda Meir">Golda Meir</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At first, she couldn't imagine herself acting the part of a well-known world figure whose physical appearance, especially her height, was so different from her own. Her daughter, Isabella, described Ingrid's surprise at being offered the part and the producer trying to explain to her, "People believe you and trust you, and this is what I want, because Golda Meir had the trust of the people." Isabella adds, "Now <i>that</i> was interesting to mother." She was also persuaded that Golda was a "grand-scale person", one that people would assume was much taller than she actually was. Chandler notes that the role "also had a special significance for her, as during World War II, Ingrid felt guilty because she had so misjudged the situation in Germany."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ingrid was frequently ill during the filming although she rarely complained or showed it. Four months after the filming was completed, she died. After Ingrid's death it was her daughter Pia who accepted her Emmy.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bergman died in 1982 on her 67th birthday in London, England, following a long battle with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer" title="Breast cancer">breast cancer</a>. Her body was cremated in London and her ashes taken to Sweden, where some were scattered in the sea and the rest placed next to her parents in Norra begravningsplatsen (Northern Cemetery), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to biographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Spoto" title="Donald Spoto">Donald Spoto</a>, she was "arguably the most international star in the history of entertainment." Acting in five languages, she was seen on stage, screen, and television, and won three Academy Awards plus many others. After her American film debut in the 1939 film <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermezzo_(1939_film)" title="Intermezzo (1939 film)"><i>Intermezzo: A Love Story</i></a>, co-starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Howard_(actor)" title="Leslie Howard (actor)">Leslie Howard</a>, Hollywood saw her as a unique actress who was completely natural in style and without need of makeup. Film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Agee" title="James Agee">James Agee</a> wrote that she "not only bears a startling resemblance to an imaginable human being; she really knows how to act, in a blend of poetic grace with quiet realism."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bergman was a tall, natural-looking, and intelligent Swedish actress, fluent in English. According to film historian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Thomson_(film_critic)" title="David Thomson (film critic)">David Thomson</a>, she "always strove to be a 'true' woman", and many filmgoers identified with her:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nonetheless, writing about her first years in Hollywood, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Magazine" title="Life Magazine"><i>Life</i></a> magazine stated that "All Bergman vehicles are blessed", and "they all go speedily and happily, with no temperament from the leading lady." She was "completely pleased" with her early career's management by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Selznick" title="David O. Selznick">David O. Selznick</a>, who always found excellent dramatic roles for her to play, and equally satisfied with her salary, once saying, "I am an actress and I am interested in acting, not in making money." <i>Life</i> adds that "she has greater versatility than any actress on the American screen ... her roles have demanded an adaptability and sensitiveness of characterization to which few actresses could rise."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She continued her acting career while fighting an eight-year battle with cancer, and won international honors for her final roles. "Her spirit triumphed with remarkable grace and courage", adds Spoto. Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cukor" title="George Cukor">George Cukor</a> once summed up her contributions to the film media when he said to her, "Do you know what I especially love about you, Ingrid, my dear? I can sum it up as your naturalness. The camera loves your beauty, your acting, and your individuality. A star must have individuality. It makes you a great star. A great star."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For her contributions to the motion picture industry, Bergman has a star on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame" title="Hollywood Walk of Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> at 6759 Hollywood Blvd.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1980, Bergman's autobiography was published under the title <i>Ingrid Bergman: My Story</i>.

It had a larger scale and budget and lends a different feel to the material.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film opens just after world-famous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera" title="Opera">opera</a> singer Alice Alquist has been <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder" title="Murder">murdered</a>. The perpetrator bolted, without the jewels he sought, after being interrupted by Paula (Bergman), Alice's niece, who was raised by her aunt following her mother's death.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Paula is sent to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> so that she can train to be an opera star, with the same teacher who once trained Alice. She studies with him for years, all the while trying to forget that terrible night at Number 9 on Thornton Square in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After Alice's things are packed away in the attic and the door blocked, things take a turn for the bizarre. At the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>, Paula loses a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooch" title="Brooch">brooch</a> that Gregory had given her, despite its having been stored safely in her handbag. Pictures disappear from the walls of the house, footsteps are heard in the sealed attic, and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_lighting" title="Gas lighting">gaslights</a> dim and brighten for no apparent reason. Gregory insinuates that Paula is responsible, but she professes no recollection of doing such things.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The young <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid" title="Maid">maid</a>, Nancy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Lansbury" title="Angela Lansbury">Angela Lansbury</a>) does little to improve the situation. Whenever she shows up, her face betrays a feeling of disdain; Paula becomes convinced that Nancy loathes her. Unknown to Paula, Gregory is in fact Sergius Bauer, her aunt's murderer. He sought out Paula in Italy, managed to win her heart, married her, and suggested they live in London, all so he could get back into the house to continue searching for Alice's jewels. He has been secretly rummaging through Alice's belongings in the attic to find the jewels he is certain are there, but so well hidden he has been unable to find them. He does everything in his power to convince his wife she is going mad, so he can have her certified insane and institutionalized, after which he can search without impediment.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plan almost works. Paula is saved by a chance encounter with a stranger at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>. He turns out to be Inspector Brian Cameron of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_Yard" title="Scotland Yard">Scotland Yard</a> (Cotten), an admirer of Alice Alquist since his childhood. By enlisting the support of the housekeeper Elizabeth (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Everest" title="Barbara Everest">Barbara Everest</a>) (who suspects her master is at the root of all the odd events) and a neighborhood busybody (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_May_Whitty" title="Dame May Whitty">Dame May Whitty</a>), Cameron is able to delve into the long-cold case. The dramatic conclusion comes as he moves in to arrest Gregory on the evening that the latter at last discovers the jewels that he has sought for so long.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <i>dÃ©nouement</i> partly involves Paula indulging herself in a bit of revenge, psychologically torturing Gregory after he's been bound to a chair, tantalizing him with the suggestion that she might free him so he can escape arrest, trial, and execution.</p>
