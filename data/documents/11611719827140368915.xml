When Scofield was a few weeks old, his family moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurstpierpoint" title="Hurstpierpoint">Hurstpierpoint</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex" title="Sussex">Sussex</a>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scofield began his stage career in 1940 with a debut performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_Under_the_Elms" title="Desire Under the Elms">Desire Under the Elms</a></i> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Theatre" title="Westminster Theatre">Westminster Theatre</a>, and was soon being compared with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An actor of extraordinary intelligence, Scofield was noteworthy for his striking presence and distinctive voice, and for the clarity and unmannered intensity of his delivery.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In his memoir <i>Threads of Time</i>, Peter Brook wrote about Scofield's versatility: "The door at the back of the set opened, and a small man entered. He was wearing a black suit, steel-rimmed glasses, and holding a suitcase. For a moment we wondered who this stranger was and why he was wandering onto our stage. Then we realized that it was Paul, transformed. His tall body had shrunk; he had become insignificant. The new character now possessed him entirely."</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film chronicles the rise and fall of the popular contestant <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Van_Doren" title="Charles Van Doren">Charles Van Doren</a> after the rigged loss of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Stempel" title="Herb Stempel">Herb Stempel</a> and the Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin's probe of <i>Twenty One'</i>s game-fixing. Goodwin co-produced the film.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From a secure bank vault, the answers to <i>Twenty One</i>, a popular primetime quiz television show, are sent into a television studio as studio producers <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Enright" title="Dan Enright">Dan Enright</a> and Albert Freedman watch from the control booth. The evening's main attraction is Queens resident Herbert Stempel, the reigning champion, who answers question after question. However, both the network and the corporate sponsor of the program, a supplementary tonic called <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geritol" title="Geritol">Geritol</a>, find that Stempel's approval ratings are beginning to level out, meaning the show would benefit from new talent.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Enright and Freedman search for a new contestant, and find one in Columbia University instructor Charles Van Doren, son of the renowned poet and intellectual <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Van_Doren" title="Mark Van Doren">Mark Van Doren</a> and the prize-winning novelist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Van_Doren" title="Dorothy Van Doren">Dorothy Van Doren</a>. The producers subtly offer to rig the show for him but Van Doren uprightly refuses. Enright soon treats Stempel to dinner at an upscale restaurant, where he breaks the news that Stempel must lose in order to boost flagging ratings. Stempel begrudgingly agrees, only on the condition that he remains on television, threatening to reveal the true reason of his success: the answers had been provided to him.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stempel and Van Doren face each other in <i>Twenty One</i>, where the match comes down to a predetermined question regarding <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty" title="Marty">Marty</a></i>, the 1955 winner of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>. Despite knowing the correct film, Stempel gives the wrong answer, allowing Van Doren to be asked a question he previously answered while in Enright's offices, to which he provides the winning response.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the weeks that follow, Van Doren's winning streak rises him to national stardom, becoming a city-wide celebrity. Buckling under the new pressure, he begins to let the producers directly give him the answers instead of researching for them himself. Meanwhile, Stempel, having lost his financial prize winnings to a fleeting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookie" title="Bookie">bookie</a>, begins threatening legal action against the NBC network after weeks go by without his return to television.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dick Goodwin, a young Congressional lawyer from Harvard Law, travels to New York to investigate rumors of rigged quiz shows. Visiting a number of contestants, including Stempel and Van Doren, he begins to suspect <i>Twenty One</i> is indeed a fixed operation. Stempel, however, is a volatile personality and nobody else seems to corroborate that the show is rigged. Goodwin enjoys the company of Van Doren, who invites him to social gatherings; he doubts a man of Van Doren's background and intellect would be involved in the hoax.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stempel desperately confesses to being in on the fix himself, and further insists that if he got the answers in advance, Van Doren did as well. With the evidence mounting, Van Doren deliberately loses, but is rewarded with a sizable contract from NBC to appear as a special correspondent on the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(NBC_program)" title="Today (NBC program)">Today</a></i> show.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stempel testifies before Congress and, while doing so, implicates Van Doren, forcing Goodwin to call him in as a witness. Van Doren goes before Congress and publicly admits his role in the conspiracy. Afterward, he is informed by reporters of his firing from <i>Today</i> as well as the university's decision to ask for his resignation.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film is the firstmajor picture based on the 1950s controversy that rocked American television and nearly led to the ruination of quiz-show producers Jack Barry (who was also <i>Twenty One</i> host and here played by McDonald) and Dan Enright (Paymer). Its attention to period detail include using New York exteriors to re-create 1950s scenes and using many New York and New Jersey indoor spaces to replicate the NBC studios and Washington governmental facilities of the times. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordham_University" title="Fordham University">Fordham University</a> was used to replicate the 1950s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a>, where Van Doren taught English.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Historical_comparison">Historical comparison</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the movie purports to portray real events, it has been widely criticized for taking liberties to create its own heroes and villains. The movie has investigator Goodwin starting his pursuit of Van Doren during the contestant's 1956-1957 run on <i>Twenty-One</i>, when in fact the Congressional investigation led by Goodwin came in Summer 1959. Others have complained that it inflates Goodwin's role in the probe and underplays the initial investigation, led by prosecutor Joseph Stone from the office of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County" title="New York County">New York County</a> District Attorney <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Hogan" title="Frank Hogan">Frank Hogan</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was after Judge Mitchell Schweitzer sealed from public release the New York grand jury presentment of findings in the probe (in June 1959) that Congress launched its investigation. The movie implies that NBC conveyed to Enright the desires of <i>Twenty-One</i> sponsor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geritol" title="Geritol">Geritol</a> that Stempel be replaced, with network president <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kintner" title="Robert Kintner">Bob Kintner</a> (played by Allan Rich) telling Enright "You're a producer, Dan. Produce." Neither Kintner nor NBC was ever implicated in the scandal and NBC cancelled the show when it heard about the scandal, but Enright claimed before his death that Geritol's complaints about the lack of drama and suspense in the unrigged premiere episode prompted the company to rig the show.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The movie shows Van Doren's win was directly because of Stempel's dive; although the question shown in the movie was the one that Stempel was supposed to take a dive on (even though he knew the correct answer), it did <i>not</i> end the game immediately, instead going on for another tie game and ending later in the show. The episode in which Stempel was defeated (which sent the ratings to a great high after Van Doren's win) aired December 5, 1956 as the thirteenth episode of the series â€“ an ironic coincidence, given standard network practice of ordering only 13 episodes of a new television show and letting the ratings decide whether a renewal is warranted.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The movie shows emcee Jack Barry slightly recoiling when a contestant, James Snodgrass, answers correctly instead of incorrectly on a question he was supposed to take a dive on; Barry, Enright's business partner and co-producer, was never implicated in rigging the show but covered up for Enright once he found out. In addition, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall" title="Monty Hall">Monty Hall</a> had replaced Barry as host in early 1958 and was still hosting when the scandal broke.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The movie does not acknowledge the rigging practices of other 1950s quiz shows â€“ the most prominent among them being <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_$64,000_Question" title="The $64,000 Question">The $64,000 Question</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotto" title="Dotto">Dotto</a></i>, and Barry-Enright's own <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-Tac-Dough" title="Tic-Tac-Dough">Tic-Tac-Dough</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Journalist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Auletta" title="Ken Auletta">Ken Auletta</a>, in a 1994 article in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i>, noted that at a screening of the film that summer, Redford admitted that, like most fact-based dramatizations, "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_license" title="Dramatic license">dramatic license</a>" was taken in making <i>Quiz Show.</i> But Auletta also reported that Redford made no apologies for the liberties, saying he had tried "to elevate something so that people can see it...otherwise, you might as well have a documentary." Redford noted there had already been a documentary on the scandal, referring to the Julian Krainin-produced work for a 1991 installment of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS" title="PBS">PBS</a> series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Experience" title="American Experience">The American Experience</a></i>. (Krainin, like Goodwin, was a co-producer of <i>Quiz Show</i>.)</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a July 2008 edition of <i>The New Yorker</i>, Charles Van Doren writes about the events depicted in the film, agreeing with many of the details but also saying that he had a regular girlfriend at the time he was on <i>Twenty One</i>. In the film depiction, he does not. He also notes that he continued teaching, contrary to the film's epilogue which states he never returned to doing so.</p>
