      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peter Seamus Lorcan O'Toole was born in 1932, with some sources giving his birthplace as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connemara" title="Connemara">Connemara</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Galway" title="County Galway">County Galway</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Free_State" title="Irish Free State">Ireland</a>, and others as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds" title="Leeds">Leeds</a>, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Riding_of_Yorkshire" title="West Riding of Yorkshire">West Riding of Yorkshire</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, where he grew up. O'Toole himself is not certain of his birthplace or date, noting in his autobiography that while he accepts 2 August as his birthdate, he has conflicting birth certificates in both countries, with the Irish one giving a June 1932 birthdate. O'Toole is the son of Constance Jane (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names" title="Married and maiden names">nÃ©e</a> Ferguson), a Scottish <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse" title="Nurse">nurse</a>, and Patrick Joseph O'Toole, an Irish metal plater, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football" title="Association football">football</a> player and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racecourse" title="Racecourse">racecourse</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker" title="Bookmaker">bookmaker</a>. When O'Toole was one year old, his family began a five-year tour of major racecourse towns in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_England" title="Northern England">Northern England</a>. He was raised <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church" title="Catholic Church">Roman Catholic</a>. O'Toole was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evacuations_of_civilians_in_Britain_during_World_War_II" title="Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II">evacuated</a> from Leeds early in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> and went to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_school" title="Catholic school">Catholic school</a> for seven or eight years, where he was "implored" to become right-handed. â€œI used to be scared stiff of the nuns: their whole denial of womanhood - the black dresses and the shaving of the hair - was so horrible, so terrifying,â€&#157; he later commented. â€œOf course, that's all been stopped. They're sipping gin and tonic in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> pubs now, and a couple of them flashed their pretty ankles at me just the other day.â€&#157;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon leaving school O'Toole obtained employment as a trainee <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist" title="Journalist">journalist</a> and photographer on the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Evening_Post" title="Yorkshire Evening Post">Yorkshire Evening Post</a>,</i> until he was called up for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service" title="National service">national service</a> as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signaller" title="Signaller">signaller</a> in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>. As reported in a radio interview in 2006 on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Public_Radio" title="National Public Radio">NPR</a>, he was asked by an officer whether he had something he had always wanted to do. His reply was that he had always wanted to try being either a poet or an actor. O'Toole attended the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Academy_of_Dramatic_Art" title="Royal Academy of Dramatic Art">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a> (RADA) from 1952 to 1954 on a scholarship after being rejected by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Theatre" title="Abbey Theatre">Abbey Theatre</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_school" title="Drama school">drama school</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> by the director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Blythe" title="Ernest Blythe">Ernest Blythe</a>, because he couldn't speak <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language" title="Irish language">Irish</a>.

O'Toole described this as "the most remarkable class the academy ever had, though we weren't reckoned for much at the time. We were all considered dotty."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">O'Toole began working in the theatre, gaining recognition as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespearean" title="Shakespearean">Shakespearean</a> actor at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Old_Vic" title="Bristol Old Vic">Bristol Old Vic</a> and with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Stage_Company" title="English Stage Company">English Stage Company</a>, before making his television debut in 1954 and a very minor film debut in 1959. O'Toole's major break came when he was chosen to play <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._E._Lawrence" title="T. E. Lawrence">T. E.

His performance was ranked number one in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiere_(magazine)" title="Premiere (magazine)">Premiere</a></i> magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Performances of All Time. The role introduced him to U.S. audiences and earned him the first of his eight nominations for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">O'Toole is also one of a handful of actors to be Oscar-nominated for playing the same role in two different films; he played <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England" title="Henry II of England">King Henry II</a> in both 1964's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becket_(film)" title="Becket (film)">Becket</a></i> and 1968's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_in_Winter_(1968_film)" title="The Lion in Winter (1968 film)">The Lion in Winter</a></i>.

His 1980 performance as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a> is often considered one of the greatest disasters in theatre history, but he has redeemed his theatrical reputation with his performances as John Tanner in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_and_Superman" title="Man and Superman">Man and Superman</a></i> and Henry Higgins in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_(play)" title="Pygmalion (play)">Pygmalion</a></i>, and won a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier_Awards" title="Laurence Olivier Awards">Laurence Olivier Award</a> for his performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Bernard_is_Unwell" title="Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell">Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell</a></i> (1989). Another performance from O'Toole, which gained him a nomination for Best Actor, was 1982's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Favorite_Year" title="My Favorite Year">My Favorite Year</a></i>, a light romantic comedy about the behind-the-scenes at a 1950s TV variety-comedy show, much like <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Show_of_Shows" title="Your Show of Shows">Your Show of Shows</a></i>, in which O'Toole plays an ageing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swashbuckler" title="Swashbuckler">swashbuckling</a> film star strongly reminiscent (intentionally) of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errol_Flynn" title="Errol Flynn">Errol Flynn</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1972 he played both <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes" title="Miguel de Cervantes">Miguel de Cervantes</a> and his fictional creation <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_La_Mancha_(film)" title="Man of La Mancha (film)">Man of La Mancha</a></i>, the motion picture adaptation of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_La_Mancha" title="Man of La Mancha">1965 smash hit Broadway musical</a>, opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Loren" title="Sophia Loren">Sophia Loren</a>. Widely criticised for using mostly non-singing actors and shunned by the public at the time, the film has gone on to become more of a success on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape" title="Videotape">videocassette</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a>, though there are those who still find fault with it. O'Toole's singing was dubbed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor" title="Tenor">tenor</a> Simon Gilbert, but the other actors sang their own parts.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He is perhaps the only one of his "London" acting contemporaries not to be <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight" title="Knight">knighted</a>. However, according to London's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a></i>, he was offered a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knighthood" title="Knighthood">knighthood</a> or honorary knighthood in 1987, but turned it down for personal and political reasons.</p>

The books have been praised by critics such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Champlin" title="Charles Champlin">Charles Champlin</a> of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i>, who wrote: "A cascade of language, a rumbling tumbling riot of words, a pub soliloquy to an invisible but imaginable audience, and the more captivating for it.

This book will have (as he described it) "the meat," meaning highlights from his stage and filmmaking career.</p>

He also said that the difference between actors of yesterday and today is that actors of his generation were trained for "theatre, theatre, theatre." He also believes that the challenge for the actor is "to use his imagination to link to his emotion" and that "good parts make good actors." However, in other venues (including the DVD commentary for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becket" title="Becket">Becket</a></i>), O'Toole has also credited <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Wolfit" title="Donald Wolfit">Donald Wolfit</a> as being his most important mentor.

O'Toole initially balked about accepting, and wrote the Academy a letter saying that he was "still in the game" and would like more time to "win the lovely bugger outright." The Academy informed him that they would bestow the award whether he wanted it or not. Further, as he related on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Charlie_Rose_Show" title="The Charlie Rose Show">The Charlie Rose Show</a></i> in January 2007, his children admonished him, saying that it was the highest honour one could receive in the filmmaking industry.

It was presented to him by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryl_Streep" title="Meryl Streep">Meryl Streep</a>, who has the most Oscar nominations of any actress (16). However his old friend Kenneth Griffith was bitterly disappointed that he had belittled himself to accept such a "ridiculous award."</p>

His unscrupulous uncle, Sir Charles (Mervyn), marries him to his mistress, Grace (Seymour), in hopes of producing an heir and putting his nephew in an institution; the plan fails when Grace falls in love with Gurney. Gurney gains another ally in Sir Charles' wife (Browne), who hates her husband and befriends Gurney just to spite him. She also begins sleeping with Gurney's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist" title="Psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a>, Dr. Herder (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bryant_(actor)" title="Michael Bryant (actor)">Michael Bryant</a>), to persuade him to cure Gurney quickly.</p>

The night his wife goes into <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_(childbirth)" title="Labour (childbirth)">labour</a>, Herder makes a last effort at therapy; he introduces Gurney to McKyle (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Green" title="Nigel Green">Nigel Green</a>), a patient who also believes himself to be <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ" title="Christ">Christ</a> or as the patient puts it, "The Electric Messiah" who subjects an unwitting Gurney to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroshock_therapy" title="Electroshock therapy">electroshock therapy</a>.

The plan works and as Grace delivers a healthy baby boy, Gurney appears to return to his senses and proclaims "I'm Jack, I'm Jack".

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The screenplay was adapted by Peter Barnes from his play with few major changes.
