      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Jane Darwell</b> (October 15, 1879 â€“ August 13, 1967) was an American film and stage actress. With appearances in over 100 major motion pictures, Darwell is perhaps best-remembered for her portrayal of the matriarch and leader of the Joad family in the film adaptation of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grapes_of_Wrath" title="The Grapes of Wrath">The Grapes of Wrath</a></i>, for which she received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, and her role as the Bird Woman in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Poppins_(film)" title="Mary Poppins (film)">Mary Poppins</a></i>.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Born <b>Patti Woodard</b> to William Robert Woodard, a railroad president, and Ellen Booth in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyra,_Missouri" title="Palmyra, Missouri">Palmyra, Missouri</a>, she originally intended to become a circus rider, then later an opera singer. Her father objected, however, and she compromised by becoming an actress, changing her name to Darwell to avoid sullying the family name.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She took up voice culture and the piano followed by a course in dramatics. At one point she decided to enter a convent but instead changed her mind and became an actress. Darwell began her acting career in theater productions in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a> and made her first film appearance in 1913. She appeared in almost twenty films over the next two years before returning to the stage.

Casy was the preacher who <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism" title="Baptism">baptized</a> Tom, but now Casy has "lost the spirit" and his faith (presaging his imminent conversion to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">communism</a>). Casy goes with Tom to the Joad property only to find it deserted. There, they meet Muley (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Qualen" title="John Qualen">John Qualen</a>) who is hiding out there. In a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)" title="Flashback (narrative)">flashback</a>, he describes how farmers all over the area were forced from their farms by the deed holders of the land, including a striking scene where a local boy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Bacon" title="Irving Bacon">Irving Bacon</a>), hired for the purpose, knocks down Muley's house with a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar" title="Caterpillar">Caterpillar</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractor" title="Tractor">tractor</a>. Following this, Tom and Casy move on to find the Joad family at Tom's uncle John's place. His family is happy to see Tom and explain they have made plans to head for California in search of employment as their farm has been foreclosed by the bank. The large Joad family of twelve leaves at daybreak, along with Casy who decides to come along, packing everything into an old and dilapidated <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1926" title="1926">1926</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Motor_Car_Company" title="Hudson Motor Car Company">Hudson</a> "Super Six" <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)" title="Sedan (automobile)">sedan</a> adapted to serve as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck" title="Truck">truck</a> in order to make the long journey to the promised land of California.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The trip along <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_66" title="U.S. Route 66">Highway 66</a> is arduous and it soon takes a toll on the Joad family. Weak and elderly Grandpa (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charley_Grapewin" title="Charley Grapewin">Charley Grapewin</a>) is the first to die on their journey. After he dies, they pull over to the shoulder of the road, unload him, and bury him. Tom writes the circumstances surrounding the death on a page from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Family Bible</a> and places it on the body so that if his remains were ever found his death would not be investigated as a possible homicide. They park in a camp and they meet a man, a returning migrant from California, who laughs at Pa's optimism about conditions in California and who speaks bitterly about his awful experiences in the West. He hints at what the Joads will soon find out for themselves. The family arrives at the first transient migrant campground for workers and find the camp is crowded with other starving, jobless and desperate travelers. Their truck slowly makes its way through the dirt road between the shanty houses and around the camp's hungry-faced inhabitants. Tom says, "Sure don't look none too prosperous."</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the altercation, Tom suffers a serious facial wound on his cheek and the camp guards realize it won't be difficult to identify him. That evening the family hides Tom under the mattresses of the truck just as guards arrive to question them and search for the killer of the guard. Tom avoids being spotted and the family successfully leaves the Keene Ranch without further incident. They drive for a while and then stop at the top of a hill when the engine overheats due to a broken fan belt; they have little gas, but decide to try coasting down the hill to some lights. The lights are from a third type of camp: Farmworkers' Wheat Patch Camp (Weedpatch in the book), a clean camp run by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture" title="United States Department of Agriculture">Department of Agriculture</a>. After Tom becomes personally idealized by what he has witnessed in the various camps, he describes how he plans to carry on Casy's mission in the world by fighting for social reform. Tom goes off to seek a new world, and he must leave his family to join the movement committed to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice" title="Social justice">social justice</a>.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first part of the film version follows the book fairly accurately. However, the second half and the ending in particular are significantly different from the book. While the book's ending tells of the downfall and ultimate break-up of the Joad family, the film switches the entire order of sequences so that the family ends up in a "good" camp provided by the government and events turn out relatively well. Also, the novel's original ending was considered far too controversial to be included in the film. In the novel Rose-of-Sharon ("Rosasharn") Rivers (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorris_Bowdon" title="Dorris Bowdon">Dorris Bowdon</a>) gives birth to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillbirth" title="Stillbirth">stillborn</a> baby and later offers her milk-filled breasts to a starving man, dying in a barn. These scenes were not included in the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, while the film is somewhat stark it has a more optimistic and hopeful view than the novel, especially when the Joads land at the Department of Agriculture campâ€”the clean camp. Also, the producers tone down Steinbeck's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics" title="Politics">political</a> references in the novel like the elimination of a monologue using a land owner's description of "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">reds</a>" as anybody "that wants thirty cents an hour when we're payin' twenty-five" to show that under the prevalent conditions that definition applies to every <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_worker" title="Migrant worker">migrant worker</a> looking for better wages. And there is also a greater emphasis on Ma Joad's pragmatic, forward-looking way of dealing with their situation despite Tom's departure and concluding in her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_(music)" title="Spiritual (music)">spiritual</a> closing "We're the people" speech.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivian_Sobchack" title="Vivian Sobchack">Vivian Sobchack</a> argued that the film uses visual imagery to focus on the Joads as a family unit, whereas the novel focuses on their journey as a part of the "family of man". She points out that their farm is never shown in detail, and that the family members are never shown working in agriculture; not a single peach is shown in the entire film. This subtly serves to focus the film on the specific family, as opposed to the novel's focus on man and land together.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, both <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer" title="Executive producer">executive producer</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darryl_F._Zanuck" title="Darryl F.

Zanuck was nervous about the left-wing political views of the novel, especially the ending.

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Critical_reception">Critical reception</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When released, the film was well received by the film critics, but it did have its detractors, especially because of its leftist political overtones. Film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_S._Nugent" title="Frank S. Nugent">Frank S. Nugent</a>, writing for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, liked the film's screenplay, the direction of the film and the acting. He wrote, "In the vast library where the celluloid literature of the screen is stored there is one small, uncrowded shelf devoted to the cinema's masterworks, to those films which by dignity of theme and excellence of treatment seem to be of enduring artistry, seem destined to be recalled not merely at the end of their particular year but whenever great motion pictures are mentioned. To that shelf of screen classics Twentieth Century-Fox yesterday added its version of John Steinbeck's <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, adapted by Nunnally Johnson, directed by John Ford and performed at the Rivoli by a cast of such uniform excellence and suitability that we should be doing its other members an injustice by saying it was 'headed' by Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, John Carradine and Russell Simpson."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Crowther" title="Bosley Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> retired in 1967, he named <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> one of the best fifty films ever made. (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nota_Bene" title="Nota Bene">N.B.</a>: 40% of the works Crowther named were not American-made, so he was placing this work in a large context.)</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a film review written for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> magazine by its editor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whittaker_Chambers" title="Whittaker Chambers">Whittaker Chambers</a>, an outspoken opponent of communism, he separated his views of Steinbeck's novel from Ford's film, which he liked. Chambers wrote, "But people who go to pictures for the sake of seeing pictures will see a great one. For <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> is possibly the best picture ever made from a so-so book...Camera craft purged the picture of the editorial rash that blotched the Steinbeck book. Cleared of excrescences, the residue is a great human story which made thousands of people, who damned the novel's phony conclusions, read it. It is the saga of an authentic U.S. farming family who lose their land. They wander, they suffer, but they endure. They are never quite defeated, and their survival is itself a triumph."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some analysts believe the "myth of the Okies", helped created by John Steinbeck's novel, is a mistake. As such, they argue the film's story rings false. The Australian conservative commentator <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Windschuttle" title="Keith Windschuttle">Keith Windschuttle</a>, writing for <i>The New Criterion</i>, wrote, "In the film of <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, Steinbeck's statement that people owned their land not because they had a piece of paper but because they had been born on it, worked on it, and died on it is given to the half-crazy character Muley Graves. His sentiments, and the injustice of the dispossession behind them, resonate throughout the drama. Again, however, these remarks bear very little relationship to the real farmers of Oklahoma."</p>
