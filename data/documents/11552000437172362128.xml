      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peter Seamus Lorcan O'Toole was born in 1932, with some sources giving his birthplace as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connemara" title="Connemara">Connemara</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Galway" title="County Galway">County Galway</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Free_State" title="Irish Free State">Ireland</a>, and others as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds" title="Leeds">Leeds</a>, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Riding_of_Yorkshire" title="West Riding of Yorkshire">West Riding of Yorkshire</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, where he grew up. O'Toole himself is not certain of his birthplace or date, noting in his autobiography that while he accepts 2 August as his birthdate, he has conflicting birth certificates in both countries, with the Irish one giving a June 1932 birthdate. O'Toole is the son of Constance Jane (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names" title="Married and maiden names">nÃ©e</a> Ferguson), a Scottish <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse" title="Nurse">nurse</a>, and Patrick Joseph O'Toole, an Irish metal plater, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football" title="Association football">football</a> player and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racecourse" title="Racecourse">racecourse</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker" title="Bookmaker">bookmaker</a>. When O'Toole was one year old, his family began a five-year tour of major racecourse towns in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_England" title="Northern England">Northern England</a>. He was raised <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church" title="Catholic Church">Roman Catholic</a>. O'Toole was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evacuations_of_civilians_in_Britain_during_World_War_II" title="Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II">evacuated</a> from Leeds early in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> and went to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_school" title="Catholic school">Catholic school</a> for seven or eight years, where he was "implored" to become right-handed. â€œI used to be scared stiff of the nuns: their whole denial of womanhood - the black dresses and the shaving of the hair - was so horrible, so terrifying,â€&#157; he later commented. â€œOf course, that's all been stopped. They're sipping gin and tonic in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> pubs now, and a couple of them flashed their pretty ankles at me just the other day.â€&#157;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon leaving school O'Toole obtained employment as a trainee <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist" title="Journalist">journalist</a> and photographer on the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Evening_Post" title="Yorkshire Evening Post">Yorkshire Evening Post</a>,</i> until he was called up for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service" title="National service">national service</a> as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signaller" title="Signaller">signaller</a> in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>. As reported in a radio interview in 2006 on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Public_Radio" title="National Public Radio">NPR</a>, he was asked by an officer whether he had something he had always wanted to do. His reply was that he had always wanted to try being either a poet or an actor. O'Toole attended the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Academy_of_Dramatic_Art" title="Royal Academy of Dramatic Art">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a> (RADA) from 1952 to 1954 on a scholarship after being rejected by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_Theatre" title="Abbey Theatre">Abbey Theatre</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_school" title="Drama school">drama school</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> by the director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Blythe" title="Ernest Blythe">Ernest Blythe</a>, because he couldn't speak <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language" title="Irish language">Irish</a>. At RADA, he was in the same class as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Finney" title="Albert Finney">Albert Finney</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Bates" title="Alan Bates">Alan Bates</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Bedford" title="Brian Bedford">Brian Bedford</a>. O'Toole described this as "the most remarkable class the academy ever had, though we weren't reckoned for much at the time. We were all considered dotty."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">O'Toole began working in the theatre, gaining recognition as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespearean" title="Shakespearean">Shakespearean</a> actor at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Old_Vic" title="Bristol Old Vic">Bristol Old Vic</a> and with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Stage_Company" title="English Stage Company">English Stage Company</a>, before making his television debut in 1954 and a very minor film debut in 1959. O'Toole's major break came when he was chosen to play <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._E._Lawrence" title="T. E. Lawrence">T. E.

His performance was ranked number one in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiere_(magazine)" title="Premiere (magazine)">Premiere</a></i> magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Performances of All Time. The role introduced him to U.S. audiences and earned him the first of his eight nominations for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">O'Toole is also one of a handful of actors to be Oscar-nominated for playing the same role in two different films; he played <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England" title="Henry II of England">King Henry II</a> in both 1964's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becket_(film)" title="Becket (film)">Becket</a></i> and 1968's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_in_Winter_(1968_film)" title="The Lion in Winter (1968 film)">The Lion in Winter</a></i>.

His 1980 performance as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a> is often considered one of the greatest disasters in theatre history, but he has redeemed his theatrical reputation with his performances as John Tanner in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_and_Superman" title="Man and Superman">Man and Superman</a></i> and Henry Higgins in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_(play)" title="Pygmalion (play)">Pygmalion</a></i>, and won a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier_Awards" title="Laurence Olivier Awards">Laurence Olivier Award</a> for his performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Bernard_is_Unwell" title="Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell">Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell</a></i> (1989). Another performance from O'Toole, which gained him a nomination for Best Actor, was 1982's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Favorite_Year" title="My Favorite Year">My Favorite Year</a></i>, a light romantic comedy about the behind-the-scenes at a 1950s TV variety-comedy show, much like <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Show_of_Shows" title="Your Show of Shows">Your Show of Shows</a></i>, in which O'Toole plays an ageing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swashbuckler" title="Swashbuckler">swashbuckling</a> film star strongly reminiscent (intentionally) of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errol_Flynn" title="Errol Flynn">Errol Flynn</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1972 he played both <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes" title="Miguel de Cervantes">Miguel de Cervantes</a> and his fictional creation <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_La_Mancha_(film)" title="Man of La Mancha (film)">Man of La Mancha</a></i>, the motion picture adaptation of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_La_Mancha" title="Man of La Mancha">1965 smash hit Broadway musical</a>, opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Loren" title="Sophia Loren">Sophia Loren</a>. Widely criticised for using mostly non-singing actors and shunned by the public at the time, the film has gone on to become more of a success on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape" title="Videotape">videocassette</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a>, though there are those who still find fault with it. O'Toole's singing was dubbed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor" title="Tenor">tenor</a> Simon Gilbert, but the other actors sang their own parts.

While studying at RADA in the early 1950s he was active in protesting against <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> involvement in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War" title="Korean War">Korean War</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He is perhaps the only one of his "London" acting contemporaries not to be <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight" title="Knight">knighted</a>. However, according to London's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a></i>, he was offered a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knighthood" title="Knighthood">knighthood</a> or honorary knighthood in 1987, but turned it down for personal and political reasons.</p>

A self-described romantic, O'Toole regards the sonnets as among the finest collection of English poems, reading them daily. In the movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_(film)" title="Venus (film)">Venus</a>,</i> he recites <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet_18" title="Sonnet 18">Sonnet 18</a>, <i>"Shall I Compare Thee To A Summer's Day."</i> O'Toole has written two memoirs. <i>Loitering With Intent: The Child</i> chronicles his childhood in the years leading up to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> and was a <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> Notable Book of the Year in 1992.

The books have been praised by critics such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Champlin" title="Charles Champlin">Charles Champlin</a> of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i>, who wrote: "A cascade of language, a rumbling tumbling riot of words, a pub soliloquy to an invisible but imaginable audience, and the more captivating for it. O'Toole as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raconteur" title="Raconteur">raconteur</a> is grand company." O'Toole spent parts of 2007 writing his third installment. This book will have (as he described it) "the meat," meaning highlights from his stage and filmmaking career.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">O'Toole is a noted fan of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union" title="Rugby union">rugby union</a>, and used to attend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Nations_Championship" title="Six Nations Championship">Five Nations</a> matches with friends and fellow rugby fans <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Harris" title="Richard Harris">Richard Harris</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Griffith" title="Kenneth Griffith">Kenneth Griffith</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Finch" title="Peter Finch">Peter Finch</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Burton" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a>.

He also said that the difference between actors of yesterday and today is that actors of his generation were trained for "theatre, theatre, theatre." He also believes that the challenge for the actor is "to use his imagination to link to his emotion" and that "good parts make good actors." However, in other venues (including the DVD commentary for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becket" title="Becket">Becket</a></i>), O'Toole has also credited <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Wolfit" title="Donald Wolfit">Donald Wolfit</a> as being his most important mentor.

O'Toole initially balked about accepting, and wrote the Academy a letter saying that he was "still in the game" and would like more time to "win the lovely bugger outright." The Academy informed him that they would bestow the award whether he wanted it or not. Further, as he related on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Charlie_Rose_Show" title="The Charlie Rose Show">The Charlie Rose Show</a></i> in January 2007, his children admonished him, saying that it was the highest honour one could receive in the filmmaking industry.

It was presented to him by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryl_Streep" title="Meryl Streep">Meryl Streep</a>, who has the most Oscar nominations of any actress (16). However his old friend Kenneth Griffith was bitterly disappointed that he had belittled himself to accept such a "ridiculous award."</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Sharif" title="Omar Sharif">Omar Sharif</a>) for drinking from a well without permission. Travelling on alone, Lawrence encounters his superior officer, Colonel Brighton (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Quayle" title="Anthony Quayle">Anthony Quayle</a>), who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment of Faisal's camp, and then leave. Lawrence promptly ignores Brighton's commands when he meets Faisal. His knowledge and outspokenness pique the prince's interest.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brighton advises the Arab leader to retreat to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yenbo" title="Yenbo">Yenbo</a> after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes an alternative, a daring attack on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqaba" title="Aqaba">Aqaba</a>. If taken, the town would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies for the rebellion. Since it is strongly defended against a naval assault by heavy artillery, Lawrence proposes a surprise attack on the lightly defended landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men on camels, led by Sherif Ali. As they prepare to leave, two teenage orphan boys, Daud (John Dimech) and Farraj (Michel Ray), attach themselves to Lawrence as his servants. They cross the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefud_Desert" title="Nefud Desert">Nefud Desert</a>, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. One of the men, Gasim (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._S._Johar" title="I. S. Johar">I. S. Johar</a>), succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. The rest make it to an oasis, but Lawrence turns back for the lost man alone, risking his own life. When he rescues Gasim, the Bedouins are very impressed, even the formerly sceptical Sherif Ali.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lawrence meets with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auda_abu_Tayi" title="Auda abu Tayi">Auda abu Tayi</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Quinn" title="Anthony Quinn">Anthony Quinn</a>), the leader of the powerful local Howeitat tribe, and persuades him to turn against the Turks by claiming there is gold in Aqaba. Lawrence's plans are almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_feud" title="Blood feud">blood feud</a>. Since Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, Lawrence declares that he will execute the murderer himself. He is stunned to discover that the culprit is Gasim, the man he had rescued earlier, but he shoots him anyway. The next morning, the intact alliance overruns the Turkish <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrison" title="Garrison">garrison</a> in Aqaba, but Auda is dismayed to discover that there is no gold there, only paper money. Lawrence appeases him by promising to get gold from the British.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lawrence heads to Cairo to inform Dryden and the new commanding general, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Allenby,_1st_Viscount_Allenby" title="Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby">General Allenby</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Hawkins" title="Jack Hawkins">Jack Hawkins</a>), of his victory. During the crossing of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinai_Desert" title="Sinai Desert">Sinai Desert</a>, Daud dies when he stumbles into <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_quicksand" title="Dry quicksand">quicksand</a>. Lawrence is promoted two ranks to major and given arms and money to support the Arabs. Lawrence initially refuses the promotion, revealing that he is deeply disturbed that he enjoyed executing Gasim, but the general brushes his qualms aside and Lawrence comes around. He asks Allenby whether the Arabs' suspicions that the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes-Picot_Agreement" title="Sykes-Picot Agreement">British have designs on Arabia</a> after the Turks are driven out have any basis. The general says at first that he's not a politician, then when pressed that they have no ambitions in Arabia.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lawrence launches a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_war" title="Guerrilla war">guerrilla war</a> against the Turks in Arabia, blowing up trains on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz_Railway" title="Hejaz Railway">Hejaz Railway</a> and harassing the Turks at every turn.

With winter approaching, many of the tribesmen go home for the year, leaving fewer and fewer die-hard supporters to continue fighting. On one raid, Farraj is badly injured when the detonator he is carrying blows up prematurely. Unwilling to leave him for the Turks to torture, Lawrence is forced to shoot him before fleeing.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Down to twenty men, Lawrence scouts the enemy-held city of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daraa" title="Daraa">Daraa</a> with Ali, but is taken, along with several Arab residents, to the Turkish <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bey" title="Bey">Bey</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ferrer" title="JosÃ© Ferrer">JosÃ© Ferrer</a>). Lawrence is lasciviously stripped, ogled, and prodded, and striking out at the Bey he is severely beaten and thrown out into the street.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, Allenby urges him to go back to the fighting to support his "big push" on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus" title="Damascus">Damascus</a>, but Lawrence is a changed, tormented man and, at first, does not want to return. Finally, Lawrence relents and recruits an army, including many killers and cutthroats motivated by money, rather than the Arab cause. They come upon a column of retreating Turkish soldiers, who have just slaughtered the villagers of Tafas. One of Lawrence's men is from the village and, after seeing the carnage, he demands, "No prisoners!" When Lawrence hesitates, another man charges the Turks by himself and is killed. Lawrence takes up the dead man's cry, resulting in a massacre in which Lawrence himself participates with relish. His men then enter Damascus before Allenby's.</p>

Lawrence</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Finney" title="Albert Finney">Albert Finney</a>, at the time a virtual unknown, was Lean's first choice to play Lawrence, but Finney was not sure the film would be a success and turned it down. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a> was also offered the part, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Perkins" title="Anthony Perkins">Anthony Perkins</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Clift" title="Montgomery Clift">Montgomery Clift</a> were briefly considered, before O'Toole was cast. Alec Guinness had previously played Lawrence in the play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_(play)" title="Ross (play)">Ross</a></i>, and was briefly considered for the part, but David Lean and Sam Spiegel thought him too old. Lean had seen O'Toole in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_They_Robbed_the_Bank_of_England" title="The Day They Robbed the Bank of England">The Day They Robbed the Bank of England</a></i> and was bowled over by his screen test, proclaiming "This <i>is</i> Lawrence!" Spiegel disliked O'Toole, having worked with him on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suddenly,_Last_Summer_(film)" title="Suddenly, Last Summer (film)">Suddenly, Last Summer</a></i> (where O'Toole was an understudy for Montgomery Clift and considered to take over his part after Clift's alcoholism caused problems), but acceded to Lean's demands after Finney and Brando dropped out. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._E._Lawrence" title="T. E. Lawrence">Pictures of Lawrence</a> suggest also that O'Toole carried some resemblance to him, in spite of their considerable height difference. O'Toole's looks prompted a different reaction from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No%C3%ABl_Coward" title="NoÃ«l Coward">NoÃ«l Coward</a>, who after seeing the premiÃ¨re of the film famously quipped "If you had been any prettier, the film would have been called Florence of Arabia".</li>

Faisal was originally to be portrayed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>; Guinness, who performed in other David Lean films, got the part when Olivier dropped out. Guinness was made up to look as much like the real Faisal as possible; he recorded in his diaries that, while shooting in Jordan, he met several people who had known Faisal who actually mistook him for the late prince. Guinness said in interviews that he developed his Arab accent from a conversation he had with Omar Sharif.</li>

Quinn got very much into his role; he spent hours applying his own makeup, using a photograph of the real Auda to make himself look as much like him as he could. One anecdote has Quinn arriving on-set for the first time in full costume, whereupon Lean, mistaking him for a native, asked his assistant to ring Quinn and notify him that they were replacing him with the new arrival.</li>
	<li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Hawkins" title="Jack Hawkins">Jack Hawkins</a> as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Allenby,_1st_Viscount_Allenby" title="Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby">General Allenby</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Spiegel" title="Sam Spiegel">Sam Spiegel</a> pushed Lean to cast <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant" title="Cary Grant">Cary Grant</a> or <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> (who was engaged at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichester_Festival_Theatre" title="Chichester Festival Theatre">Chichester Festival Theatre</a>, and declined). Lean, however, convinced him to choose Hawkins due to his work for them on <i>The Bridge on the River Kwai</i>. Hawkins shaved his head for the role and reportedly clashed with David Lean several times during filming. Alec Guinness recounted that Hawkins was reprimanded by Lean for celebrating the end of a day's filming with an impromptu dance. Hawkins became close friends with O'Toole during filming, and the two often improvised dialogue during takes, much to Lean's dismay.</li>
	<li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Sharif" title="Omar Sharif">Omar Sharif</a> as Sherif Ali ibn el Kharish. The role was offered to many actors before Omar Sharif was cast. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Buchholz" title="Horst Buchholz">Horst Buchholz</a> was the first choice, but had already signed on for the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One,_Two,_Three" title="One, Two, Three">One, Two, Three</a></i>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Delon" title="Alain Delon">Alain Delon</a> had a successful screen test, but ultimately declined due to the brown contact lenses he would have had to wear. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Ronet" title="Maurice Ronet">Maurice Ronet</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilip_Kumar" title="Dilip Kumar">Dilip Kumar</a> were also considered. Sharif, who was already a major star in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, was originally cast as Lawrence's guide Tafas, but when the above actors proved unsuitable, Sharif was shifted to the part of Ali.</li>
	<li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ferrer" title="JosÃ© Ferrer">JosÃ© Ferrer</a> as the Turkish Bey. Ferrer was initially unsatisfied with the small size of his part, and accepted the role only on the condition of being paid $25,000 (more than O'Toole and Sharif combined) plus a factory-made <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche" title="Porsche">Porsche</a>. However, he afterwards considered this his best film performance, saying in an interview: <i>"If I was to be judged by any one film performance, it would be my five minutes in</i> Lawrence<i>."</i> Peter O'Toole once said that he learned more about screen acting from Ferrer than he could in any acting class.</li>
	<li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Quayle" title="Anthony Quayle">Anthony Quayle</a> as Colonel <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brighton" title="Harry Brighton">Harry Brighton</a>. Quayle, a veteran of military roles, was cast after Jack Hawkins, the original choice, was shifted to the part of Allenby. Quayle and Lean argued over how to portray the character, with Lean feeling Brighton to be an honourable character, while Quayle thought him an idiot.</li>
	<li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Rains" title="Claude Rains">Claude Rains</a> as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Dryden" title="Mr. Dryden">Mr. Dryden</a>. Rains had previously worked with Lean on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Passionate_Friends" title="The Passionate Friends">The Passionate Friends</a></i>. Lean considered Rains one of his favourite actors and was happy to work with him again.</li>

In the early days of the production, when the Bentley character had a more prominent role in the film, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Douglas" title="Kirk Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a> was considered for the part; Douglas expressed interest but demanded a star salary and the highest billing after O'Toole, thus being turned down by Spiegel. Later, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_O%27Brien" title="Edmond O'Brien">Edmond O'Brien</a> was cast in the part. O'Brien filmed the Jerusalem scene, and (according to Omar Sharif) Bentley's political discussion with Ali, but he became ill due to a heart attack on location and had to be replaced at the last moment by Kennedy, who was recommended to Lean by Anthony Quinn.</li>

It was largely Storrs' doing that Lawrence first met Faisal and became involved with the Revolt. This character is also partially based upon Lawrence's archaeologist friend, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.G._Hogarth" title="D.G. Hogarth">D.G. Hogarth</a>, as well as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sykes" title="Mark Sykes">Mark Sykes</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_McMahon" title="Henry McMahon">Henry McMahon</a>, who historically fulfilled Dryden's role as a political liaison. He was created by the screenwriters to "represent the civilian and political wing of British interests, to balance Allenby's military objectives."</li>
	<li>Colonel Brighton â€” In essence a composite of all of the British officers who served in the Middle East with Lawrence, most notably Lt. Col. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.F._Newcombe" title="S.F. Newcombe">Stewart F. Newcombe</a>. Newcombe played much the same role as Brighton does in the film, being Lawrence's predecessor as liaison to the Arab Revolt; he and many of his men were captured by the Turks in 1916, though he later escaped. Also, like Brighton, Newcombe was not well-liked by the Arabs, though he remained friends with Lawrence. (In Michael Wilson's original script, he <i>was</i> Colonel Newcombe; the character's name was later changed by Robert Bolt.) Brighton was apparently created to represent how ordinary British soldiers would feel about a man like Lawrence: impressed by his accomplishments but repulsed by his affected manner. (Lean argued that Brighton was "the only honourable character" in the film, whereas <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Quayle" title="Anthony Quayle">Anthony Quayle</a> referred to his character as an "idiot".)</li>
	<li>Turkish Bey â€” The Turkish Bey who captures Lawrence in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daraa" title="Daraa">Daraa</a> was â€” according to Lawrence himself â€” General Hajim Bey (in Turkish, <i>Hacim Muhiddin Bey</i>), though he is not named in the film. Though the incident was mentioned in Lawrence's autobiography <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Pillars_of_Wisdom" title="Seven Pillars of Wisdom">Seven Pillars of Wisdom</a></i>, a few historians have conjectured that this event never happened. This is not the view of Jeremy Wilson, <i>The Authorised Biography of T. E. Lawrence</i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0689119348">ISBN 0-689-11934-8</a>) or the author of the Pulitzer Prize winning biography <i>A Prince of Our Disorder,</i> John E. Mack, (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/0316542326">ISBN 0-316-54232-6</a>).</li>
	<li>Jackson Bentley â€” Based on famed American journalist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Thomas" title="Lowell Thomas">Lowell Thomas</a>, who helped make Lawrence famous with accounts of his bravery. However, Thomas was at the time a young man who spent only a few days (or weeks at most) with Lawrence in the field - unlike Bentley, who is depicted as a cynical middle-aged Chicago newspaperman who is present during the whole of Lawrence's later campaigns. Bentley was the narrator in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wilson_(writer)" title="Michael Wilson (writer)">Michael Wilson</a>'s original script, but <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bolt" title="Robert Bolt">Robert Bolt</a> reduced his role significantly for the final script. Thomas did not start reporting on Lawrence until after the end of World War I, and held Lawrence in high regard, unlike Bentley, who seems to hold him in contempt.</li>
	<li>Tafas â€” Lawrence's guide to Faisal is based on his actual guide, Sheikh Obeid el-Rashid, of the Hazimi branch of the Beni Salem, whom Lawrence referred to as Tafas several times in <i>Seven Pillars</i>. Tafas and Lawrence did meet Sherif Ali at a well during Lawrence's travels to Faisal, but the encounter was not fatal for either party. (Indeed, this scene would create much controversy amongst Arab viewers.)</li>
	<li>Medical Officer â€” This unnamed officer who confronts Lawrence in Damascus is based on an actual incident in <i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i>. Lawrence's meeting the officer again while in British uniform was, however, an invention of Wilson or Bolt.</li>

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Historical_accuracy">Historical accuracy</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The historical accuracy of the film, and particularly its portrayal of Lawrence himself, has been called into question by numerous scholars. Most of the film's characters are either real or based on real characters to varying degrees. The events depicted in the film are largely based on accepted historical fact and Lawrence's own writing about events, though they have various degrees of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/romanticise" title="wiktionary:romanticise">romanticisation</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some scenes â€” such as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aqaba" title="Battle of Aqaba">attack on Aqaba</a> â€” were heavily <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fiction" title="wiktionary:fiction">fictionalised</a>, while those dealing with the Arab Council were inaccurate, inasmuch as the council remained more or less in power in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria" title="Syria">Syria</a> until <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> deposed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisal_I_of_Iraq" title="Faisal I of Iraq">Faisal</a> in 1920. Little background on the history of the region, the First World War, and the Arab Revolt is provided, probably due to Bolt's increased focus on Lawrence (while Wilson's draft script had a broader, more politicized version of events). The theme (in the second half of the film) that Lawrence's Arab army deserted almost to a man as he moved farther north was completely fictional. The film's timeline of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt" title="Arab Revolt">Arab Revolt</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, and the geography of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz" title="Hejaz">Hejaz</a> region, are frequently questionable. For instance, Bentley interviews Faisal in late 1917, after the fall of Aqaba, saying the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> has not yet entered the war; yet America had been in the war for several months by that point in time. Further, Lawrence's involvement in the Arab Revolt prior to the attack on Aqaba â€” such as his involvement in the seizures of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yenbo" title="Yenbo">Yenbo</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wejh" title="Wejh">Wejh</a> â€” is completely excised. The rescue and execution of Gasim is based on two separate incidents, which were conflated together for dramatic reasons.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many complaints about the film's accuracy, however, centre on the characterisation of Lawrence himself. The perceived problems with the portrayal of Lawrence begin with the differences in his physical appearance: 6-foot 2-inch (1.87 m) <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_O%27Toole" title="Peter O'Toole">Peter O'Toole</a> was almost nine inches (23Â cm) taller than the real Lawrence. His behaviour, however, has caused much more debate.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The screenwriters depict Lawrence as an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egotism" title="Egotism">egotist</a>. The degree to which Lawrence sought or shunned attention, such as his use after the war of various <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliases" title="Aliases">assumed names</a>, is a matter of debate. Even during the war, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Thomas" title="Lowell Thomas">Lowell Thomas</a> wrote in <i>With Lawrence in Arabia</i> that he could take pictures of him only by tricking him, although Lawrence did later agree to pose for several pictures for Thomas's stage show. Thomas's famous comment that Lawrence "had a genius for backing into the limelight" referred to the fact that his extraordinary actions prevented him from being as private as he would have liked. Others disagree, pointing to Lawrence's own writings in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Pillars_of_Wisdom" title="Seven Pillars of Wisdom">Seven Pillars of Wisdom</a></i> to support the argument that he was egotistical.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lawrence's sexual orientation remains a controversial topic amongst historians; though Bolt's primary source was ostensibly <i>Seven Pillars</i>, the film's portrayal seems informed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Aldington" title="Richard Aldington">Richard Aldington</a>'s then-recent <i>Biographical Inquiry</i> (1955), which posited among other things that Lawrence was homosexual. The film features Lawrence's alleged <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadomasochism" title="Sadomasochism">sadomasochism</a> as a major part of his character (for instance, his "match trick" in Cairo, squeezing a rock in the desert after his meeting with Feisal, his "enjoyment" of killing Gasim); while Lawrence almost certainly engaged in flagellation and like activities after the Deraa incident, there is no biographical evidence he was a masochist prior to that incident. The movie's depiction of Lawrence as an active participant in the Tafas Massacre was disputed at the time by historians, including Lawrence's biographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Liddell_Hart" title="Basil Liddell Hart">Basil Liddell Hart</a>, but most current biographers accept the film's portrayal of the massacre as reasonably accurate.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the movie does show that Lawrence could speak and read Arabic, could quote the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran" title="Quran">Quran</a>, and was reasonably knowledgeable about the region, it barely mentions his archaeological travels from 1911 to 1914 in Syria and Arabia, and ignores his espionage work, including a pre-war topographical survey of the Sinai Peninsula and his attempts to negotiate the release of British prisoners at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Kut" title="Siege of Kut">Kut</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> in 1916.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, in the film, Lawrence is only made aware of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes-Picot_Agreement" title="Sykes-Picot Agreement">Sykes-Picot Agreement</a> very late in the story wheras the "real" Lawrence, while fighting alongside the Arabs, knew much earlier, but had hoped that the Arabs' contribution to the Allied victory would convince the Allies to grant the Arabs their independence. Lawrence was, as the film suggests, torn between loyalty to the British and his promises to the Arabs, but by delaying his knowledge of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, the film removes the early catalyst for this conflict.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film portrays General Allenby as cynical and manipulative, with a superior attitude to Lawrence, but there is much evidence that Allenby and Lawrence respected and liked each other. Lawrence once said that Allenby was "an admiration of mine" and later that he was "physically large and confident and morally so great that the comprehension of our littleness came slow to him". In contrast to the fictional Allenby's words at Lawrence's funeral in the film, upon Lawrence's death Allenby remarked;, "I have lost a good friend and a valued comrade. Lawrence was under my command, but, after acquainting him with my strategical plan, I gave him a free hand. His co-operation was marked by the utmost loyalty, and I never had anything but praise for his work, which, indeed, was invaluable throughout the campaign" Allenby also spoke highly of him on numerous other occasions. It seems likely that this characterisation of Allenby is in large part due to the screenwriters' anti-war sentiments. Although Allenby admittedly did manipulate Lawrence during the war, their relationship lasted for years after its end, indicating that in real-life they were friendly, if not close. The Allenby family was particularly upset by the Damascus scenes, where Allenby coldly allows the town to fall into chaos as the Arab Council collapses.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The depiction of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auda_abu_Tayi" title="Auda abu Tayi">Auda abu Tayi</a> as a man interested only in loot and money is also at odds with the historical record. Although Auda did at first join the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt" title="Arab Revolt">Arab Revolt</a> for monetary reasons, he quickly became a steadfast supporter of Arab independence and abandoned the cause only after the collapse of the Arab government in Damascus. He was present with Lawrence from the beginning of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqaba" title="Aqaba">Aqaba</a> expedition and in fact helped plan it along with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisal_I_of_Iraq" title="Faisal I of Iraq">Prince Faisal</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Faisal, far from being the middle-aged man depicted, was in reality in his early thirties at the time of the revolt. Although Lawrence considered Faisal to be a wise and insightful man, Faisal was noted for his predatory sense of humour, often involving mean practical jokes, which is not shown in the film. The two men also had a much closer relationship than the film implies.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A particularly telling fact of the film's inaccuracies is the reaction of those who knew Lawrence and the other characters. The most vehement critic of the film's inaccuracy was Professor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.W._Lawrence" title="A.W. Lawrence">A.W. Lawrence</a>, T.E.'s younger brother and literary executor, who had sold the rights to <i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i> to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Spiegel" title="Sam Spiegel">Sam Spiegel</a> for Â£25,000. Lawrence went on a campaign in the United States and Britain denouncing the film, famously saying, "I should not have recognised my own brother". Lowell Thomas was also critical of the portrayal of Lawrence and most of the film's characters, believing that the train attack scenes were the only reasonably accurate aspect of the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The criticisms were not restricted to Lawrence. The Allenby family lodged a formal complaint against Columbia about the portrayal of their ancestor. Descendants of Auda abu Tayi and the real Sherif Ali, despite the fact that the film's Ali was fictional went further, actively suing Columbia due to the portrayal of their ancestors. The Auda case went on for almost ten years before it was finally dropped.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jeremy Wilson, among others, has noted that the film has "undoubtedly influenced the perceptions of some subsequent biographers" such as the depiction of the film's Ali as the real Sherif Ali, rather than a composite character, and also the highlighting of the Deraa incident, The film's historical inaccuracies are, in his view, more troublesome than what can be allowed under normal dramatic license.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Previous films about T. E. Lawrence had been planned but had not been made. In the 1940s, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Korda" title="Alexander Korda">Alexander Korda</a> was interested in filming <i>The Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> as Lawrence, but had to pull out due to financial difficulties. David Lean himself had been approached to direct a 1952 version for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_Organisation" title="Rank Organisation">Rank Organisation</a>, but the project fell through. Also, at the same time as pre-production of the film, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Rattigan" title="Terence Rattigan">Terence Rattigan</a> was developing his play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_(play)" title="Ross (play)">Ross</a></i> which centred primarily on Lawrence's alleged homosexuality. <i>Ross</i> had begun life as a screenplay, but was re-written for the stage when the film project fell through. Sam Spiegel grew furious and unsuccessfully attempted to have the play suppressed, furore at which helped to gain publicity for the film. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Bogarde" title="Dirk Bogarde">Dirk Bogarde</a> had accepted the role in <i>Ross</i>; he described the cancellation of the project as "my bitterest disappointment". Alec Guinness would play the role on stage.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lean and Sam Spiegel were coming off the huge success of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_on_the_River_Kwai" title="Bridge on the River Kwai">Bridge on the River Kwai</a></i>, and were eager to work together again. For a time, Lean was interested in a biopic of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhi" title="Gandhi">Gandhi</a>, with Alec Guinness to play the title role and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emeric_Pressburger" title="Emeric Pressburger">Emeric Pressburger</a> writing the screenplay, but Lean eventually lost interest in the project. Lean then returned his attention to T.E. Lawrence. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> had an interest in a Lawrence project dating back to the early '50s, and when Spiegel convinced a reluctant <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.W._Lawrence" title="A.W. Lawrence">A.W. Lawrence</a> to sell the rights to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Pillars_of_Wisdom" title="The Seven Pillars of Wisdom">The Seven Pillars of Wisdom</a></i> for Â£25,000, the project got underway.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> was first announced, Lawrence's biographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Thomas" title="Lowell Thomas">Lowell Thomas</a> offered producer Spiegel and screenwriters Bolt and Wilson a large amount of research material he had produced on Lawrence during and after his time with him in the Arab Revolt. Spiegel rejected the offer.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wilson_(writer)" title="Michael Wilson (writer)">Michael Wilson</a> wrote the original draft of the screenplay. However, Lean was dissatisfied with Wilson's work, primarily because his treatment focused primarily on the historical and political aspects of the Arab Revolt. Lean hired <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bolt" title="Robert Bolt">Robert Bolt</a> to re-write the script in order to make it a character study of Lawrence himself. While many of the characters and scenes are Wilson's invention, virtually all of the dialogue in the finished film was written by Bolt.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lean reportedly watched <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" title="John Ford">John Ford</a>'s film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Searchers_(film)" title="The Searchers (film)">The Searchers</a></i> (1956) to help him develop ideas as to how to shoot the film. Several scenes in the movie directly recall Ford's film, most notably Ali's entrance at the well and the composition of many of the desert scenes, most notably the exit from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadi_Rum" title="Wadi Rum">Wadi Rum</a>. Lean biographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Brownlow" title="Kevin Brownlow">Kevin Brownlow</a> even notes the physical similarity between Rumm and Ford's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_Valley" title="Monument Valley">Monument Valley</a>. The film's plot structure also bears similarity to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a></i> (1941), particularly the opening scenes with Lawrence's death and the reporter inquiring notables at Lawrence's funeral.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was made by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Pictures" title="Horizon Pictures">Horizon Pictures</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>. Shooting began on 15 May 1961 and ended on 20 October 1962.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The desert scenes were shot in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan" title="Jordan">Jordan</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>, as well as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almer%C3%ADa_(province)" title="AlmerÃ­a (province)">AlmerÃ­a</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do%C3%B1ana_National_Park" title="DoÃ±ana National Park">DoÃ±ana</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>. The film was originally to be filmed entirely in Jordan: the government of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_of_Jordan" title="Hussein of Jordan">King Hussein</a> was extremely helpful in providing logistical assistance, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location_scouting" title="Location scouting">location scouting</a>, transportation, and extras; Hussein himself visited the set several times during production and maintained cordial relationships with cast and crew. During the production of the film, in fact, Hussein met and married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Muna_al-Hussein" title="Princess Muna al-Hussein">Toni Gardner</a>, who was working as a switchboard operator in Aqaba. One of the film's technical advisors/horse wranglers in Jordan was a descendant of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auda_abu_Tayi" title="Auda abu Tayi">Auda abu Tayi</a>. The only tension occurred when local Jordanian officials learned that English actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Oscar" title="Henry Oscar">Henry Oscar</a>, who did not speak <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic" title="Arabic">Arabic</a>, would be filmed reciting the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qur%27an" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a>; permission was granted only on condition that an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imam" title="Imam">imam</a> be present to ensure that there were no misquotations.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Jordan, Lean planned to film in, among other places, the real Aqaba and the archaeological site at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra" title="Petra">Petra</a>, which Lawrence had been fond of as a place of study. However, the production had to be moved to Spain, much to Lean's regret, due to cost and outbreaks of illness among the cast and crew before these scenes could be shot. The attack on Aqaba (one of the more stirring and memorable scenes in the movie with a spectacular pan shot of dust rising up from behind the charging Arabs while Turkish cannons are aimed harmlessly out to sea) was reconstructed in a dried river bed in southern Spain; it consisted of over 300 buildings and was meticulously based on the town's appearance in 1917. The execution of Gasim and the train attacks were filmed in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almer%C3%ADa" title="AlmerÃ­a">AlmerÃ­a</a> region, with the former's filming being delayed because of a flash flood. The city of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville" title="Seville">Seville</a> was also used to represent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo" title="Cairo">Cairo</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, with the appearance of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alc%C3%A1zar_of_Seville" title="AlcÃ¡zar of Seville">AlcÃ¡zar of Seville</a> and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_de_Espa%C3%B1a_(Seville)" title="Plaza de EspaÃ±a (Seville)">Plaza de EspaÃ±a</a>. All of the film's interiors were shot in Spain, including Lawrence's first meeting with Faisal and the scene in Auda's tent.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Tafas massacre was filmed in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouarzazate" title="Ouarzazate">Ouarzazate</a>, Morocco, with Moroccan army troops substituting for the Turkish army; however, Lean was unable to film as much as he wanted because the soldiers were uncooperative and impatient. One of the second-unit directors for the Morocco scenes was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_de_Toth" title="AndrÃ© de Toth">AndrÃ© de Toth</a>, who suggested a shot wherein bags of blood would be machine-gunned, spraying the screen with blood. Assistant director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Roeg" title="Nicolas Roeg">Nicolas Roeg</a> approached Lean with this idea, but Lean found it disgusting. De Toth subsequently left the project.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film's production was frequently delayed because, unusually, the film started shooting without a finished script. After Wilson quit early in the production, playwright <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverley_Cross" title="Beverley Cross">Beverley Cross</a> worked on the script in the interim before Bolt took over, although none Cross' material made it to the final film. A further mishap occurred when Bolt was arrested for taking part in an anti-nuclear weapons demonstration, and Spiegel had to persuade Bolt to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bind_over" title="Bind over">sign a recognizance</a> of good behaviour for him to be released from jail and continue working on the script.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel" title="Camel">Camels</a> caused several problems on set. O'Toole was not used to riding camels and found the saddle to be uncomfortable. While in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amman" title="Amman">Amman</a> during a break in filming, he bought a piece of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam_rubber" title="Foam rubber">foam rubber</a> at a market and added it to his saddle. Many of the extras copied the idea and sheets of the foam can be seen on many of the horse and camel saddles. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin" title="Bedouin">Bedouins</a> nicknamed O'Toole " 'Ab al-'Isfanjah " (<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">Ø£Ø¨ Ø§Ù„Ø¥Ø³Ù&#129;Ù†Ø¬Ø©</span>), meaning "Father of the Sponge". The idea spread and to this day, many Bedouins add foam rubber to their saddles.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Later, during the filming of the Aqaba scene, O'Toole was nearly killed when he fell from his camel, but fortunately, it stood over him, preventing the horses of the extras from trampling him. Coincidentally a very similar mishap befell the real Lawrence at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aqaba" title="Battle of Aqaba">Battle of Abu El Lissal</a> in 1917. In another mishap, O'Toole seriously injured his hand during filming by punching through the window of a caravan while drunk. A brace or bandage can be seen on his left thumb during the first train attack scene, presumably due to this incident.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Along with many other Arab countries, Jordan would ban the film for what they felt to be a disrespectful portrayal of Arab culture. Egypt, Omar Sharif's home country, was the only Arab nation to give the film a wide release, where it became a success through the endorsement of President <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser" title="Gamal Abdel Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a>, who appreciated the film's depiction of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Arabism" title="Pan-Arabism">Arab nationalism</a>.</p>

Although <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Boult" title="Adrian Boult">Sir Adrian Boult</a> is credited as the conductor of the score in the film's credits, he was unable to conduct most of the score, due in part to his failure to adapt to the intricate timings of each cue, and Jarre replaced him as the conductor.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an email to Robert Morris, co-author of a book on <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> (Feb. 22, 2005), Richard May, VP Film Preservation at Warner Bros., noted that <i>Gone With the Wind</i>, never edited after its premiere, is 19,884Â ft of 35Â mm film (without leaders, overture, intermission, entr'acte or walkout music) corresponding to 220.93 min.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A later theatrical re-release ran for 202Â minutes; an even shorter cut of 187Â minutes briefly surfaced in the 1970s. The first round of cuts was made at the direction and even insistence of David Lean, to assuage criticisms of the film's length and increase the number of showings per day; however, during the 1989 restoration, he would later pass blame for the cuts onto by-then-deceased producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Spiegel" title="Sam Spiegel">Sam Spiegel</a>.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of the cut scenes were dialogue sequences, particularly those involving General Allenby and his staff. Two whole scenesâ€”Brighton's briefing of Allenby in Jerusalem before the Daraa scene and the British staff meeting in the field tentâ€”were completely excised, and the former has still not been entirely restored. Much of the missing dialogue involves Lawrence's writing of poetry and verse, alluded to by Allenby in particular, saying "the last poetry general we had was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington" title="Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington">Wellington</a>". The opening of Act II, where Faisal is interviewed by Bentley, and the later scene, in Jerusalem where Allenby convinces Lawrence not to resign, existed in only fragmented form; they were restored to the 1989 re-release. Some of the more graphic shots of the Tafas massacre sceneâ€”the lengthy panning shot of the corpses in Tafas, and Lawrence shooting a surrendering Turkish soldierâ€”were also restored. Most of the still-missing footage is of minimal import, supplementing existing scenes. One scene is an extended version of the Daraa rape sequence, which makes Lawrence's punishment in that scene more overt. Other scripted scenes exist, including a conversation between Auda and Lawrence immediately after the fall of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqaba" title="Aqaba">Aqaba</a>, a brief scene of Turkish officers noting the extent of Lawrence's campaign, and the battle of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra" title="Petra">Petra</a> (later reworked into the first train attack), but these scenes were probably not filmed. The actors still living at the time of the re-release dubbed their own dialogue, though <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Hawkins" title="Jack Hawkins">Jack Hawkins</a>'s dialogue had to be dubbed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Gray_(actor)" title="Charles Gray (actor)">Charles Gray</a> (who had already done Hawkins' voice for several films after the former developed throat cancer in the late 1960s).
