She was both the dancer/collaborator/muse upon whom he choreographed much of his work and, together with dancer/choreographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Reinking" title="Ann Reinking">Ann Reinking</a>, a significant guardian of the Fosse legacy after his death.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fosse was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>, to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norwegian</a> father and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Irish</a> mother, the second youngest of six children. He teamed up with Charles Grass, another young dancer, and began a collaboration under the name <i>The Riff Brothers</i>. They toured theatres throughout the Chicago area. Eventually Fosse was hired for <i>Tough Situation</i>, which toured military and naval bases in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fosse moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> with the ambition of being the next <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Astaire" title="Fred Astaire">Fred Astaire</a>. His appearance with his first wife and dance partner Mary Ann Niles (1923â€“1987) in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_Me_Mister" title="Call Me Mister">Call Me Mister</a></i> brought him to the attention of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Martin" title="Dean Martin">Dean Martin</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Lewis" title="Jerry Lewis">Jerry Lewis</a>. Fosse and Niles were regular performers on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Hit_Parade" title="Your Hit Parade">Your Hit Parade</a></i> during its 1950-51 season, and during this season Martin and Lewis caught their act in New York's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Hotel" title="Pierre Hotel">Pierre Hotel</a> and scheduled them to appear on the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colgate_Comedy_Hour" title="Colgate Comedy Hour">Colgate Comedy Hour</a></i>. His early screen appearances included <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_A_Girl_A_Break" title="Give A Girl A Break">Give A Girl A Break</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Affairs_of_Dobie_Gillis" title="The Affairs of Dobie Gillis">The Affairs of Dobie Gillis</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_Me_Kate_(film)" title="Kiss Me Kate (film)">Kiss Me Kate</a></i>, all released in 1953. A short sequence that he choreographed in the latter (and danced with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Haney" title="Carol Haney">Carol Haney</a>) brought him to the attention of Broadway producers.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although Fosse's acting career in film was cut short by premature balding, which limited the roles he could take, he was reluctant to move from Hollywood to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">theatre</a>. Nevertheless, he made the move, and in 1954, he choreographed his first musical, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pajama_Game" title="The Pajama Game">The Pajama Game</a></i>, followed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Abbott" title="George Abbott">George Abbott</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damn_Yankees" title="Damn Yankees">Damn Yankees</a></i> in 1955. It was while working on the latter show that he first met the red-headed rising star whom he would marry in 1960, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Verdon" title="Gwen Verdon">Gwen Verdon</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Verdon won her first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award" title="Tony Award">Tony Award</a> for Best Actress for <i>Damn Yankees</i> (she had won previously for best supporting actress in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can-Can" title="Can-Can">Can-Can</a></i>). (Fosse appears in the film version of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damn_Yankees" title="Damn Yankees">Damn Yankees</a></i>, which he also choreographed, in which Verdon reprises her stage triumph as "Lola"; they partner each other in the mambo number, "Who's Got the Pain".) In 1957 Fosse choreographed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Girl_in_Town" title="New Girl in Town">New Girl in Town</a>, again directed by George Abbott, and Verdon won her second Leading Actress Tony. In 1960, Fosse was, for the first time, both director and choreographer of a musical called simply <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redhead_(musical)" title="Redhead (musical)">Redhead</a></i>. With <i>Redhead</i>, Verdon won her third <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Actress_in_a_Musical" title="Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical">Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical</a>, the show won the Tony for best musical and Fosse carried off the award for best choreography. Fosse would partner star Verdon as her director/choreographer again with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Charity" title="Sweet Charity">Sweet Charity</a></i> and again with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_(musical)" title="Chicago (musical)">Chicago</a></i>. (Fosse would win the Tony for Best Direction of a Musical in 1973 with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippin_(musical)" title="Pippin (musical)">Pippin</a></i>.) Fosse performed a memorable song and dance number in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Donen" title="Stanley Donen">Stanley Donen</a>'s 1974 film version of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince_(film)" title="The Little Prince (film)"><i>The Little Prince</i></a>, and in 1977, Fosse had a small role in the romantic comedy <i>Thieves</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fosse developed a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_dance" title="Jazz dance">jazz dance</a> style that was immediately recognizable, exuding a stylized, cynical sexuality. Other notable distinctions of his style included the use of turned-in knees, sideways shuffling, and rolled shoulders. With Astaire as an influence, he used props such as bowler hats, canes and chairs. His trademark use of hats was influenced by his own self-consciousness. According to Martin Gottfried in his biography of Fosse, <i>"His baldness was the reason that he wore hats, and was doubtless why he put hats on his dancers."</i> He used gloves in his performances because he did not like his hands. Some of his most popular numbers include "Steam Heat" (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pajama_Game" title="The Pajama Game">The Pajama Game</a></i>) and "Big Spender" (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Charity" title="Sweet Charity">Sweet Charity</a></i>). The "Rich Man's Frug" scene in "Sweet Charity" is another example of his signature style. Although he was replaced as the director/choreographer for the short-lived 1961 musical <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquering_Hero" title="The Conquering Hero">The Conquering Hero</a></i>, he quickly took on the job of choreographer of the 1961 musical hit <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Succeed_in_Business_Without_Really_Trying" title="How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying">How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</a></i>, which starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morse" title="Robert Morse">Robert Morse</a>. In 1986 he directed and choreographed the unsuccessful Broadway production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Deal_(play)" title="Big Deal (play)">Big Deal</a></i>, which he also wrote.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Later_career">Later career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fosse directed five feature films. His first, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Charity_(film)" title="Sweet Charity (film)">Sweet Charity</a></i> in 1969, starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_MacLaine" title="Shirley MacLaine">Shirley MacLaine</a>, is an adaptation of the Broadway musical he had directed and choreographed. Fosse shot the film largely on location in Manhattan. His second film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret_(film)" title="Cabaret (film)">Cabaret</a></i>, won eight Academy Awards, including Best Director, for which he won over <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola" title="Francis Ford Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a> for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></i> starring Marlon Brando. The film was shot on location in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>; <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liza_Minnelli" title="Liza Minnelli">Liza Minnelli</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Grey" title="Joel Grey">Joel Grey</a> both won Oscars for their roles.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fosse went on to direct <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_(film)" title="Lenny (film)">Lenny</a></i> in 1974, a biopic of comic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Bruce" title="Lenny Bruce">Lenny Bruce</a> starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman" title="Dustin Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a>. The film was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director Oscars, among other awards. But just as Fosse picked up his Oscar for <i>Cabaret</i>, his Tony for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippin" title="Pippin">Pippin</a></i>, and an Emmy for directing Liza Minnelli's television concert, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liza_with_a_Z" title="Liza with a Z">Liza with a Z</a></i>, his health suffered and he underwent open-heart surgery.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1979, Fosse co-wrote and directed a semi-autobiographical film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_That_Jazz" title="All That Jazz">All That Jazz</a></i>, which portrayed the life of a womanizing, drug-addicted choreographer-director in the midst of triumph and failure. <i>All That Jazz</i> won four Academy Awards and earned Fosse his third Oscar nomination for Best Director. It also won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or" title="Palme d'Or">Palme d'Or</a> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Cannes_Film_Festival" title="1980 Cannes Film Festival">1980 Cannes Film Festival</a>. In the summer and fall of 1980, working with <i>All That Jazz</i> executive producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Melnick" title="Daniel Melnick">Daniel Melnick</a>, Fosse commissioned documentary research for a follow-up feature having to do with the motivations that compel people to become performers, but he found the results uninspiring and abandoned the project.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <i>All That Jazz</i>, Fosse not only toyed with the notion of his own death, but immortalized the two people who would perpetuate the Fosse legacy, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Verdon" title="Gwen Verdon">Gwen Verdon</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Reinking" title="Ann Reinking">Ann Reinking</a>. Reinking appears in the film as the protagonist's lover/protege/domestic-partner. She, like Verdon, would be responsible for keeping Fosse's trademark choreography alive after Fosse's death. Reinking played the role of Roxie Hart in the highly successful New York revival of <i>Chicago</i>, which opened in 1996. She choreographed the dances "in the style of Bob Fosse" for that revival, which is still running on Broadway as of January 2010. In 1999, Verdon served as artistic consultant on a plotless Broadway musical designed to showcase examples of classic Fosse choreography. Called simply <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fosse" title="Fosse">Fosse</a></i>, the three-act musical revue was conceived and directed by Richard Maltby, Jr. and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Reinking" title="Ann Reinking">Ann Reinking</a> and choreographed by Reinking and Chet Walker. Verdon and Fosse's daughter, Nicole, received a "special thanks" credit. The show won a Tony for best musical.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His final film, 1983's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_80" title="Star 80">Star 80</a></i>, was a controversial biopic about slain <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy" title="Playboy">Playboy</a></i> Playmate <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Stratten" title="Dorothy Stratten">Dorothy Stratten</a>. The movie is based on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning article on the same topic. The film was nominated for several awards, and won the best film award at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_International_Film_Festival" title="Berlin International Film Festival">Berlin International Film Festival</a>.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Innovations">Innovations</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fosse was an innovative choreographer and had multiple achievements in his life. For <i>Damn Yankees</i>, he took a great deal of inspiration from the <i>"father of theatrical jazz dance"</i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Cole_(choreographer)" title="Jack Cole (choreographer)">Jack Cole</a>. He also took influence from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Robbins" title="Jerome Robbins">Jerome Robbins</a>. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Girl_in_Town" title="New Girl in Town">New Girl in Town</a></i> gave Fosse the inspiration to direct and choreograph his next piece because of the conflict of interest within the collaborators. During that piece, the first he'd directed as well as choreographed, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redhead_(musical)" title="Redhead (musical)">Redhead</a></i>, Fosse utilized one of the first ballet sequences in a show that contained five different styles of dance; Fosse's jazz, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancan" title="Cancan">cancan</a>, a gypsy dance, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_(music)" title="March (music)">march</a>, and an old-fashioned English music hall number. Fosse utilized the idea of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtext" title="Subtext">subtext</a> and gave his dancers something to think about during their numbers. He also began the trend of allowing lighting to influence his work and direct the audience's attention to certain things. During <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippin_(musical)" title="Pippin (musical)">Pippin</a></i>, Fosse made the first ever commercial for a Broadway show.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1957, both Verdon and Fosse were studying with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_Meisner" title="Sanford Meisner">Sanford Meisner</a> to develop a better acting technique for themselves. According to Michael Joosten, Fosse once said: "The time to sing is when your emotional level is too high to just speak anymore, and the time to dance is when your emotions are just too strong to only sing about how you feel."</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fosse was first married in 1949 to dance partner <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ann_Niles" title="Mary Ann Niles">Mary Ann Niles</a>.

Fosse's second marriage was to dancer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_McCracken" title="Joan McCracken">Joan McCracken</a> (December 1952-59). His third wife was dancer/actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Verdon" title="Gwen Verdon">Gwen Verdon</a> in 1960; they had one daughter, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicole_Fosse&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Nicole Fosse (page does not exist)">Nicole Providence Fosse</a>, who is also a dancer. He separated from Verdon in the 1970s, but they remained legally married until his death. Verdon never remarried.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On September 23, 1987, it was reported that Bob Fosse collapsed in his room at the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC, and later died.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Choreographing and casting for dancers for his next Broadway show, while editing his severely over-budgeted and over-scheduled Hollywood production about a stand-up comic, is getting to Joe Gideon. He is a workaholic, choreographer, and theater director who chain-smokes and chain-sleeps with all of his dancers. Without a daily dose of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Vivaldi" title="Antonio Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visine" title="Visine">Visine</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alka-Seltzer" title="Alka-Seltzer">Alka-Seltzer</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine" title="Dextroamphetamine">Dexedrine</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex" title="Sex">sex</a>, he wouldn't have the energy to keep up the biggest show of them all â€” his life. His girlfriend Katie Jagger, his ex-wife Audrey Paris, and daughter Michelle try to pull him back from the brink, but it is too late for his exhausted body and stress-ravaged heart. Decades of overworking and constant tremendous stress have gotten to Gideon. In his imagination, he already flirts with an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(personification)" title="Death (personification)">angel of death</a> named Angelique.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gideon's condition gets worse, as after a particularly stressful script rehearsal with the penny-pinching backers, he is taken to a hospital with chest pains and admitted with severe attacks of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina_pectoris" title="Angina pectoris">angina</a>. Joe tries to take it in stride and walk straight back to the rehearsal, but is ordered to stay for three to four weeks to rest his heart and recover from his exhaustion. The show is postponed, but Gideon continues his antics from the hospital bed. Champagne flows, endless strings of women frolic around and the cigarettes are always lit. Cardiogram readings don't show any improvement - Gideon is playing with death. As the paltry reviews for his feature film (which has been released without him) come in, Gideon has a massive coronary and is taken straight to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery" title="Coronary artery bypass surgery">coronary artery bypass surgery</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The backers for the Broadway show must decide now whether it's time to pack up or replace Gideon as the director. Their matter-of-fact money-oriented negotiations with the insurers are juxtaposed with graphic scenes of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_surgery" title="Cardiac surgery">open heart surgery</a>. They realize the best way to recoup their money, even make a profit, is to bet on Gideon dying â€” which would bring in a profit of over <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">USD</a>$500,000 â€” not bad in the crazy unpredictable world of showbiz. Meanwhile, elements from Gideon's past life are staged into a dazzling sequence of set-ups â€” himself directing from the hospital bed, while on life support. Realizing his death is imminent, his mortality unconquerable, Gideon has another heart attack. In glittery musical numbers, he goes through the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief" title="Five stages of grief">five phases of grief</a> â€” anger, denial, bargaining, depression and acceptance - featured in the stand-up routine he has been editing. As death closes in on Gideon, the fantasy episodes become more hallucinatory and extravagant and in a final epilogue that is set up as a truly monumental live variety show featuring everyone from his past, Gideon himself takes center stage.</p>

A key to the success of the production is the performance of Roy Scheider as Joe Gideon... With an actor of less weight and intensity, <i>All That Jazz</i> might have evaporated as we watched it.
