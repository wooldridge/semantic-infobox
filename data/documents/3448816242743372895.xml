      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1978, when Ryder was seven years old, she and her family relocated to Rainbow, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commune_(intentional_community)" title="Commune (intentional community)">commune</a> near <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk,_Mendocino_County,_California" title="Elk, Mendocino County, California">Elk, Mendocino County, California</a>, where they lived with seven other families on a 300-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre" title="Acre">acre</a> (120Â <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare" title="Hectare">ha</a>) plot of land. As the remote property had no <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity" title="Electricity">electricity</a> or television sets, Ryder began to devote her time to reading and became an avid fan of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Salinger" title="J.

At ageÂ 10, Ryder and her family moved on again, this time to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petaluma,_California" title="Petaluma, California">Petaluma</a>, California. During her first week at the Kenilworth Junior High, she was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying" title="Bullying">bullied</a> by a group of her peers who mistook her for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effeminate" title="Effeminate">effeminate</a>, scrawny boy. As a result, she ended up being <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling" title="Homeschooling">homeschooled</a> that year.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1985, Ryder sent a videotaped audition, where she recited a monologue from the novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franny_and_Zooey" title="Franny and Zooey">Franny and Zooey</a></i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Salinger" title="J.

When asked how she wanted her name to appear in the credits, she suggested "Ryder" as her surname because a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Ryder" title="Mitch Ryder">Mitch Ryder</a> album that belonged to her father was playing in the background.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Her next movie was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Dance_(film)" title="Square Dance (film)">Square Dance</a></i> (1987), where her teenage character creates a bridge between two different worlds â€” a traditional farm in the middle of nowhere and a large city.

Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Burton" title="Tim Burton">Tim Burton</a> decided to cast Ryder in his film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetlejuice" title="Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a></i> (1988), after being impressed with her performance in <i>Lucas</i>. In the film, she plays <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goth_subculture" title="Goth subculture">goth</a> teenager Lydia Deetz.

After the girl's death, Ryder starred in the 1994 film adaptation of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women_(1994_film)" title="Little Women (1994 film)">Little Women</a></i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisa_May_Alcott" title="Louisa May Alcott">Louisa May Alcott</a> and dedicated it to her memory. <i>Little Women</i> was one of Klaas's favorite novels. During a sentencing hearing related to the 2001 shoplifting incident (see below), Ryder's attorney, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Geragos" title="Mark Geragos">Mark Geragos</a>, referred to her work with the Polly Klaas Foundation and other charitable causes. In response, Deputy District Attorney Ann Rundle said: "What's offensive to me is to trot out the body of a dead child." Ryder was visibly upset at the accusation and Rundle was admonished by the judge. Outside the courthouse, Polly's father Marc Klaas defended Ryder and expressed outrage at the prosecutor's comments.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On December 12, 2001, Ryder was arrested on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoplifting" title="Shoplifting">shoplifting</a> charges in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills,_California" title="Beverly Hills, California">Beverly Hills</a>, California.

Ryder hired noted celebrity defense attorney <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Geragos" title="Mark Geragos">Mark Geragos</a>. Negotiations for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain" title="Plea bargain">plea bargain</a> failed at the end of summer 2002. As noted by Joel Mowbray from the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Review" title="National Review">National Review</a></i>, the prosecution was not ready to offer the actress what was given to 5,000 other defendants in similar cases, an open door to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolo_contendre" title="Nolo contendre">no-contest plea</a> on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor" title="Misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a> charges. Ryder agreed under signature to pay two Civil Demands, as permitted under California's Statute for Civil Recovery for Shoplifting, from Saks Fifth Avenue that completely reimbursed Saks Fifth Avenue for the stolen and surrendered merchandise while detained in the Security Offices of the Saks Fifth Avenue store, and before she was read her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_warning" title="Miranda warning">Miranda rights</a> and arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the trial, she was accused of using drugs without valid prescriptions.

After reviewing Ryder's probation report, Superior Court Judge Elden Fox noted that Ryder served 480Â hours of community service and on JuneÂ 18, 2004, the felonies were reduced to misdemeanors. Ryder remained on probation until December 2005.</p>

Mr. Scorsese and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ballhaus" title="Michael Ballhaus">Michael Ballhaus</a>, the cinematographer, employ a camera style of sometimes dizzy, sweeping, lyrical romanticism.

Each performance is modulated to preserve the delicate balance of the romantic war. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Day-Lewis" title="Daniel Day-Lewis">Daniel Day-Lewis</a> stands at the center, deluded for a time that he has free will. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Pfeiffer" title="Michelle Pfeiffer">Michelle Pfeiffer</a>, as the countess, is a woman who sees through society without quite rejecting it, and takes an almost sensuous pleasure in seducing Archer with the power of her mind.

The two principal female roles are superbly filled. For any actress to make the transition from Catwoman to Ellen Olenska would be impressive, and that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Pfeiffer" title="Michelle Pfeiffer">Pfeiffer</a> succeeds here as she did in her last film is the most conclusive proof yet of her widening talents. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winona_Ryder" title="Winona Ryder">Ryder</a> is also perfect as the child-woman with a more tenacious instinct than her retiring manner would indicate... <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Scorsese</a> brings great energy to what could have been a very static story, although his style is more restrained and less elaborate than usual. Script by the director and former film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cocks" title="Jay Cocks">Jay Cocks</a> judiciously trims the story down to manageable length while retaining its essential elements. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Bernstein" title="Elmer Bernstein">Elmer Bernstein</a>'s score is full-bodied and richly romantic, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelma_Schoonmaker" title="Thelma Schoonmaker">Thelma Schoonmaker</a>'s editing is very finely tuned and the scene transitions are notably varied."</p>

Of course, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Day-Lewis" title="Daniel Day-Lewis">Day-Lewis</a>, who counts tortured romanticism among his specialties, seems to relish love's exquisite pangs. He and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Pfeiffer" title="Michelle Pfeiffer">Pfeiffer</a> are physically as gorgeous together as their gilded surroundings.

You've got ennui between your teeth, dear heart, so go floss. At two hours and 13 minutes, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Scorsese</a> has allowed himself enough time to follow <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Wharton" title="Edith Wharton">Wharton</a>'s book to the letter, and also enough time to include long stretches of painfully wearisome society functions and banter. As a period piece, it's a joy to behold, but with such an indecisive little newt of a protagonist, it's just hard to give a damn what happens."</p>
