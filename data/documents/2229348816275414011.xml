Both of her parents were originally from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_City,_Kansas" title="Arkansas City, Kansas">Arkansas City, Kansas</a>. Her father was an art dealer and her mother a former actress whose stage name was 'Sara Sothern'. Sothern retired from the stage when she and Francis Taylor married in 1926 in New York City. Taylor's two first names are in honour of her paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Mary (Rosemond) Taylor. A <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_citizenship" title="Multiple citizenship">dual citizen</a> of the UK and the U.S., she was born a British subject through her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_soli" title="Jus soli">birth on British soil</a> and an American citizen <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_sanguinis" title="Jus sanguinis">through her parents</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the age of three, Taylor began taking ballet lessons with Vaccani. Shortly before the beginning of World War II, her parents decided to return to the United States to avoid hostilities. Her mother took the children first, arriving in New York in April 1939, while her father remained in London to wrap up matters in the art business, arriving in November. They settled in Los Angeles, California, where Sara's family, the Warmbrodts, were then living.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Through Hopper, the Taylors were introduced to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andrea_Berens&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Andrea Berens (page does not exist)">Andrea Berens</a>, a wealthy English socialite and also fiancÃ©e of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cheever_Cowden&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Cheever Cowden (page does not exist)">Cheever Cowden</a>, chairman and major stockholder of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Pictures" title="Universal Pictures">Universal Pictures</a> in Hollywood.

However, on 18 September 1941, Universal Pictures signed Elizabeth to a six-month renewable contract at $100 a week.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taylor appeared in her first motion picture at the age of nine in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_One_Born_Every_Minute" title="There's One Born Every Minute">There's One Born Every Minute</a></i>, her first and only film for Universal Pictures. Less than six months after she signed with Universal, her contract was reviewed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_Muhl&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Edward Muhl (page does not exist)">Edward Muhl</a>, the studio's production chief. Muhl met with Taylor's agent, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_Selznick" title="Myron Selznick">Myron Selznick</a> (brother of David) and with Cheever Cowden. Muhl challenged Selznick's and Cowden's constant support of Taylor: "She can't sing, she can't dance, she can't perform. What's more, her mother has to be one of the most unbearable women it has been my displeasure to meet." Universal cancelled Taylor's contract just short of her tenth birthday in February 1942. Nevertheless on 15 October 1942, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer signed Taylor to $100 a week for up to three months to appear as Priscilla in <i>Lassie Come Home</i>.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassie_Come_Home" title="Lassie Come Home">Lassie Come Home</a></i> featured child star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roddy_McDowall" title="Roddy McDowall">Roddy McDowall</a>, with whom Taylor would share a lifelong friendship. Upon its release in 1943, the film received favourable attention for both McDowall and Taylor. On the basis for her performance in <i>Lassie Come Home</i> MGM signed Taylor to a conventional seven-year contract at $100 a week but increasing at regular intervals until it reached a hefty $750 during the seventh year. Her first assignment under her new contract at MGM was a loan-out to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a> for the character of Helen Burns in a film version of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Bronte" title="Charlotte Bronte">Charlotte Bronte</a> novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Eyre_(1944_film)" title="Jane Eyre (1944 film)">Jane Eyre</a></i> (1944). During this period she also returned to England to appear in another Roddy McDowall picture for MGM, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Cliffs_of_Dover_(1944_film)" title="The White Cliffs of Dover (1944 film)">The White Cliffs of Dover</a></i> (1944). But it was Taylor's persistence in campaigning for the role of Velvet Brown in MGM's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Velvet_(film)" title="National Velvet (film)">National Velvet</a></i> that skyrocketed Taylor to stardom at the tender age of 12. Taylor's character, Velvet Brown, is a young girl who trains her beloved horse to win the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aintree_Grand_National" title="Aintree Grand National">Grand National</a>. <i>National Velvet</i>, which also costarred beloved American favorite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Rooney" title="Mickey Rooney">Mickey Rooney</a> and English newcomer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Lansbury" title="Angela Lansbury">Angela Lansbury</a>, became an overwhelming success upon its release in December 1944 and altered Taylor's life forever. Also, many of her back problems have been traced to when she hurt her back falling off a horse during the filming of <i>National Velvet</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>National Velvet</i> grossed over US$4Â million at the box office and Taylor was signed to a new long-term contract that raised her salary to $30,000 per year. To capitalize on the box office success of Velvet, Taylor was shoved into another animal opus, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courage_of_Lassie" title="Courage of Lassie">Courage of Lassie</a></i>, in which a different dog named "Bill", cast as an Allied combatant in World War II, regularly outsmarts the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazis" title="Nazis">Nazis</a>, with Taylor going through another outdoors role. The 1946 success of <i>Courage of Lassie</i> led to another contract drawn up for Taylor earning her $750 per week, her mother $250, as well as a $1,500 bonus. Her roles as Mary Skinner in a loan-out to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Brothers" title="Warner Brothers">Warner Brothers</a>' <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_with_Father_(film)" title="Life with Father (film)">Life With Father</a></i> (1947), Cynthia Bishop in <i>Cynthia</i> (1947), Carol Pringle in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Date_with_Judy_(film)" title="A Date with Judy (film)">A Date with Judy</a></i> (1948) and Susan Prackett in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Misbehaves" title="Julia Misbehaves">Julia Misbehaves</a></i> (1948) all proved to be successful. Her reputation as a bankable adolescent star and nickname of "One-Shot Liz" (referring to her ability to shoot a scene in one take) promised her a full and bright career with Metro. Taylor's portrayal as Amy, in the American classic <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women_(1949_film)" title="Little Women (1949 film)">Little Women</a></i> (1949) would prove to be her last adolescent role. In October 1948, she sailed aboard the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Queen_Mary" title="RMS Queen Mary">RMS Queen Mary</a> travelling to England where she would begin filming on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conspirator_(1949_film)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Conspirator (1949 film) (page does not exist)">Conspirator</a></i>, where she would play her first adult role.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When released in 1949, <i>Conspirator</i> bombed at the box office, but Taylor's portrayal of 21-year-old debutante Melinda Grayton (keeping in mind that Taylor was only 16 at the time of filming) who unknowingly marries a communist spy (played by 38-year-old <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(actor)" title="Robert Taylor (actor)">Robert Taylor</a>), was praised by critics for her first adult lead in a film, even though the public didn't seem ready to accept her in adult roles. Taylor's first picture under her new salary of $2,000 per week was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Big_Hangover&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="The Big Hangover (page does not exist)">The Big Hangover</a></i> (1950), both a critical and box office failure, that paired her with screen idol <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Johnson" title="Van Johnson">Van Johnson</a>. The picture also failed to present Taylor with an opportunity to exhibit her newly-realized sensuality. Her first box office success in an adult role came as Kay Banks in the romantic comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_of_the_Bride_(1950_film)" title="Father of the Bride (1950 film)">Father of the Bride</a></i> (1950), alongside <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Bennett" title="Joan Bennett">Joan Bennett</a>. The film spawned a sequel, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father%27s_Little_Dividend" title="Father's Little Dividend">Father's Little Dividend</a></i> (1951), which Taylor's costar Spencer Tracy summarised with "boring...boring...boring." The film was received well at the box office but it would be Taylor's next picture that would set the course for her career as a dramatic actress.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In late 1949, Taylor had begun filming <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stevens" title="George Stevens">George Stevens</a>' <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Place_in_the_Sun" title="A Place in the Sun">A Place In The Sun</a></i>. Upon its release in 1951, Taylor was hailed for her performance as Angela Vickers, a spoiled socialite who comes between George Eastman (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Clift" title="Montgomery Clift">Montgomery Clift</a>) and his poor, pregnant factory-working girlfriend Alice Tripp (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Winters" title="Shelley Winters">Shelley Winters</a>).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film became the pivotal performance of Taylor's career as critics acclaimed it as a classic, a reputation it sustained throughout the next 50 years of cinema history. <i>The New York Times'</i> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A.H._Weiler&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="A.H. Weiler (page does not exist)">A.H. Weiler</a> wrote, "Elizabeth's delineation of the rich and beauteous Angela is the top effort of her career," and the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxoffice_(magazine)" title="Boxoffice (magazine)">Boxoffice</a></i> reviewer unequivocally stated "Miss Taylor deserves an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a>." "If you were considered pretty, you might as well have been a waitress trying to act â€“ you were treated with no respect at all", she later bitterly reflected.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even with such critical success as an actress, Taylor was increasingly unsatisfied with the roles being offered to her at the time. While she wanted to play the leads in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Barefoot_Contessa" title="The Barefoot Contessa">The Barefoot Contessa</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27ll_Cry_Tomorrow" title="I'll Cry Tomorrow">I'll Cry Tomorrow</a></i>, MGM continued to restrict her to mindless and somewhat forgettable films such as: a cameo as herself in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callaway_Went_Thataway" title="Callaway Went Thataway">Callaway Went Thataway</a></i> (1951), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Is_Better_Than_Ever" title="Love Is Better Than Ever">Love Is Better Than Ever</a></i> (1952), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanhoe_(1952_film)" title="Ivanhoe (1952 film)">Ivanhoe</a></i> (1952), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_Who_Had_Everything" title="The Girl Who Had Everything">The Girl Who Had Everything</a></i> (1953) and <i>Beau Brummel</i> (1954).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taylor had made it perfectly clear that she wanted to play the role of Lady Rowena in <i>Ivanhoe</i>, but the part had already been given to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Fontaine" title="Joan Fontaine">Joan Fontaine</a> and she was handed the thankless role of Rebecca. When she became pregnant with her first child, MGM forced her through <i>The Girl Who Had Everything</i> (even adding two hours to her daily work schedule) so as to get one more film out of her before she became too heavily pregnant. Taylor lamented that she needed the money, as she had just bought a new house with second husband <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wilding_(actor)" title="Michael Wilding (actor)">Michael Wilding</a> and with a child on the way things would be pretty tight. Taylor had been forced by her pregnancy to turn down <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_Walk" title="Elephant Walk">Elephant Walk</a></i> (1954), though the role had been designed for her. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivien_Leigh" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>, to whom Taylor bore a striking resemblance, got the part and went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceylon" title="Ceylon">Ceylon</a> to shoot on location. Leigh had a nervous breakdown during filming, and Taylor finally reclaimed the role after the birth of her child Michael Wilding, Jr. in January 1953.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taylor's next screen endeavor, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhapsody_(1954_film)" title="Rhapsody (1954 film)">Rhapsody</a></i> (1954), another tedious romantic drama, proved equally frustrating. Taylor portrayed Louise Durant, a beautiful rich girl in love with a temperamental violinist (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Gassman" title="Vittorio Gassman">Vittorio Gassman</a>) and an earnest young pianist (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ericson" title="John Ericson">John Ericson</a>). A film critic for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Herald_Tribune" title="New York Herald Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a></i> wrote: "There is beauty in the picture all right, with Miss Taylor glowing into the camera from every angle...but the dramatic pretenses are weak, despite the lofty sentences and handsome manikin poses."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taylor's fourth period picture, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Brummell_(film)" title="Beau Brummell (film)">Beau Brummell</a></i>, made just after <i>Elephant Walk</i> and <i>Rhapsody</i>, cast her as the elaborately costumed Lady Patricia, which many felt was only a screen propâ€”a ravishing beauty whose sole purpose was to lend romantic support to the film's title star, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Granger" title="Stewart Granger">Stewart Granger</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Time_I_Saw_Paris" title="The Last Time I Saw Paris">The Last Time I Saw Paris</a></i> (1954) fared only slightly better than her previous pictures, with Taylor being reunited with <i>The Big Hangover</i> costar Van Johnson. The role of Helen Ellsworth Willis was based on that of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda_Fitzgerald" title="Zelda Fitzgerald">Zelda Fitzgerald</a> and, although pregnant with her second child, Taylor went ahead with the film, her fourth in twelve months. Although proving somewhat successful at the box office, she still yearned for meatier roles.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i> won both the 1963 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Play" title="Tony Award for Best Play">Tony Award for Best Play</a> and the 1962-63 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Drama_Critics%27_Circle" title="New York Drama Critics' Circle">New York Drama Critics' Circle</a> Award for Best Play. Its stars won the 1963 Tony Awards for Best Actor and Actress as well. It was also selected for the 1963 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Drama" title="Pulitzer Prize for Drama">Pulitzer Prize for Drama</a> by that award's drama jury. However, the award's advisory boardâ€”the trustees of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a>â€”objected to the play's then-controversial use of profanity and sexual themes, and overruled the award's advisory committee, awarding no Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1963.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i> is a play on the title of the once popular song "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?" from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Little_Pigs_(film)" title="Three Little Pigs (film)">The Three Little Pigs</a></i>, but named after the famous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf" title="Virginia Woolf">English novelist</a>.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the play, George and Martha invite a new professor and his wife to their house after a party. Martha is the daughter of the president of the college (believed to be based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College_(Connecticut)" title="Trinity College (Connecticut)">Trinity College, Connecticut</a>) where George is an associate history professor. Nick (who is never addressed or introduced by name) is a biology professor (who Martha thinks teaches math), and Honey is his mousy, brandy-abusing wife. Once at home, Martha and George continue drinking and engage in relentless, scathing verbal and sometimes physical abuse in front of Nick and Honey. The younger couple are simultaneously fascinated and embarrassed. They stay even though the abuse turns periodically towards them as well.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The play's title, which alludes to the English novelist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf" title="Virginia Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a>, is a parody of the song "Who's Afraid of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bad_Wolf" title="Big Bad Wolf">Big Bad Wolf</a>?" from Walt Disney's animated version of <i>The Three Little Pigs</i>. Because obtaining the rights to use the music would have been expensive, most stage versions, and the film, have Martha sing to the tune of "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_We_Go_Round_the_Mulberry_Bush" title="Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush">Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush</a>". This melody fits the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_(poetry)" title="Meter (poetry)">meter</a> fairly well and is in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain" title="Public domain">public domain</a>. In the first few moments of the play, it is revealed that someone sang the song earlier in the evening at a party, although who first sang it (Martha or some other anonymous party guest) remains unclear. Martha repeatedly needles George over whether he found it funny.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidence of the joke's humor, or existence has yet to be obtained. In interviews, Albee has said that he asked Woolf's widower <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Woolf" title="Leonard Woolf">Leonard Woolf</a> for permission to use her name in the title of the play. In another interview, Albee acknowledged that he based the characters of Martha and George on his good friends, New York socialites <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Maas" title="Willard Maas">Willard Maas</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Menken" title="Marie Menken">Marie Menken</a>. They share the names of President <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> and his wife <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Washington" title="Martha Washington">Martha Custis Dandridge Washington</a>, America's first First Couple. Maas was a professor of literature at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_College" title="Wagner College">Wagner College</a> (one similarity between the character George and Willard) and his wife Marie was an experimental filmmaker and painter. Maas and Menken were known for their infamous salons, where drinking would "commence at 4pm on Friday and end in the wee hours of night on Monday" (according to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Malanga" title="Gerard Malanga">Gerard Malanga</a>, Warhol associate and friend to Maas). The primary conflict between George and Martha in <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i> derived from Maas and Menken's tempestuous and volatile relationship. Many darker veins running through the play's dialogue suggest that the border between fiction and reality is continually challenged. The play ends with Martha answering the titular question of who is afraid to live their life free of illusions with, "I am, George, I am." Implicitly, exposure is something everyone fears: faÃ§ade (be it social or psychological), although damaging, provides a comfort.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot_summary">Plot summary</span></h2>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">George and Martha return from a faculty party, but Martha soon informs George that she has invited over guests. These guests, Nick and his wife, Honey, are much younger than George and Martha. The "after-party" starts off fine, but soon Martha begins to taunt George. She stresses his failures brutally and drives him out of the room. Martha then tells an embarrassing story about how she humiliated him with a sucker punch in front of her father. During the telling George appears with a gun; he fires it and an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella" title="Umbrella">umbrella</a> pops out. Even after this joke, Martha's taunts continue. Nick and Honey grow uneasy; George reacts violently. Honey runs to the bathroom to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit" title="Vomit">vomit</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nick and George are then alone. Nick talks about his wife and her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_pregnancy" title="Phantom pregnancy">hysterical pregnancy</a>. George proceeds to tell Nick a story about visiting a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin" title="Gin">gin</a> mill with a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boarding_school" title="Boarding school">boarding school</a> classmate. This friend was laughed at for ordering "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_whiskey" title="Bourbon whiskey">bergin</a>", shot and killed his mother accidentally, killed his father while learning to drive, and was committed to an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital" title="Psychiatric hospital">asylum</a> shortly thereafter. George and Nick argue. Eventually, George calls Nick a "smug son of a bitch."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Martha appears alone in the living room, shouting at the others to come out from hiding. Nick joins her after a while, recalling Honey in the bathroom winking at him. The doorbell rings: it is George, with a bunch of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon" title="Snapdragon">snapdragons</a> in his hand, calling out, "Flores para los muertos" (<i>flowers for the dead</i>, in a reference to a line in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_(play)" title="A Streetcar Named Desire (play)">A Streetcar Named Desire</a>).</i> Martha and George argue about whether the moon is up or down (possibly a <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taming_of_the_Shrew" title="Taming of the Shrew">Taming of the Shrew</a></i> reference): George insists it is up, while Martha says she saw no moon from the bedroom. This leads to a discussion where Martha and George insult Nick in tandem, an argument that reveals that Nick was too drunk to have sex with Martha upstairs anyway.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">George asks Nick to bring his wife back out for the final game "Bringing Up Baby." George and Martha have a son, about whom George has repeatedly told Martha to keep quiet over the course of the night, but now George talks about Martha's overbearingness toward their son. George then prompts Martha for her "recitation", in which they describe their son's upbringing in a bizarre duet. Martha describes their son's beauty and talents and then accuses George of ruining his life. As this tale progresses, George begins to recite sections of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dies_Irae" title="Dies Irae">Dies Irae</a></i> (part of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem" title="Requiem">Requiem</a>, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> mass for the dead).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the end of the tale, George informs Martha that the door chimes heard earlier was a boy from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Union" title="Western Union">Western Union</a> who brought a telegram that said their son had died: "killed late in the afternoon ... on a country road, with his learner's permit in his pocket, he swerved, to avoid a porcupine"â€”a description that matches that of the boy in the gin mill story told earlier. Martha screams "You can't do that!" and collapses.</p>
