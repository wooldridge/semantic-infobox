      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Born Audrey Kathleen Ruston on Rue Keyenveld (French)/ Keienveldstraat (Dutch) in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixelles" title="Ixelles">Ixelles</a>/Elsene, a municipality in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, she was the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_child" title="Only child">only child</a> of Joseph Victor Anthony Ruston (1889â€“1980), an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_people" title="English people">English</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker" title="Banker">banker</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people" title="Irish people">Irish</a> descent, and his second wife Ella <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Heemstra" title="Van Heemstra">van Heemstra</a>, the former Baroness Ella (1900â€“1984), a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_people" title="Dutch people">Dutch</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy_(class)" title="Aristocracy (class)">aristocrat</a>, who was a daughter of a former governor of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Guiana" title="Dutch Guiana">Dutch Guiana</a>, and who spent her childhood in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huis_Doorn" title="Huis Doorn">Huis Doorn</a> manor house outside <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doorn" title="Doorn">Doorn</a>, that was subsequently the residence in exile of the former German Emperor, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor" title="Wilhelm II, German Emperor">Wilhelm II</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Her father later prefixed the surname of his maternal grandmother, Kathleen Hepburn, to the family's and her surname became Hepburn-Ruston. She had two half-brothers, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonkheer" title="Jonkheer">Jonkheer</a></i> Arnoud Robert Alexander "Alex" Quarles van Ufford (1920â€“1979) and <i>Jonkheer</i> Ian Edgar Bruce Quarles van Ufford (born 1924), by her mother's first marriage to a Dutch nobleman, <i>Jonkheer</i> Hendrik Gustaaf Adolf Quarles van Ufford.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although born in Belgium, Hepburn had <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_citizenship" title="British citizenship">British citizenship</a> and attended school in England as a child. Hepburn's father's job with a British <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance" title="Insurance">insurance</a> company meant that the family often travelled between <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. From 1935 to 1938, Hepburn was educated at Miss Rigden's School, an independent girls' school in the village of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elham" title="Elham">Elham</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent" title="Kent">Kent</a> in the south east of England.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1935, Hepburn's parents divorced and her father, a Nazi sympathiser, left the family. Both parents were members of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Union_of_Fascists" title="British Union of Fascists">British Union of Fascists</a> in the mid-1930s according to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_Mitford" title="Unity Mitford">Unity Mitford</a>, a friend of Ella van Heemstra and a follower of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn referred to her father's abandonment as the most traumatic moment of her life. Years later, she located him in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin,_Ireland" title="Dublin, Ireland">Dublin, Ireland</a> through the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" title="Red Cross">Red Cross</a>. Although he remained emotionally detached, she stayed in contact with him and supported him financially until his death.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1939, her mother moved her and her two half-brothers to their grandfather's home in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnhem" title="Arnhem">Arnhem</a> in the Netherlands, believing the Netherlands would be safe from German attack. Hepburn attended the Arnhem Conservatory from 1939 to 1945, where she trained in ballet along with the standard school curriculum. In 1940, the Germans <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Netherlands" title="Battle of the Netherlands">invaded the Netherlands</a>. During the German occupation, Hepburn adopted the pseudonym <i>Edda van Heemstra</i>, modifying her mother's documents because an "English sounding" name was considered dangerous, with her mother feeling that "Audrey" might indicate her British roots too strongly. Being English in the occupied Netherlands was not an asset; it could have attracted the attention of the occupying German forces and resulted in confinement or even deportation. Edda was never her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_name" title="Legal name">legal name</a>, also it was a version of her mother's name Ella.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By 1944, Hepburn had become a proficient ballerina. She secretly danced for groups of people to collect money for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_resistance" title="Dutch resistance">Dutch resistance</a>. She later said, "The best audience I ever had made not a single sound at the end of my performances". After the Allied landing on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_Landings" title="Normandy Landings">D-Day</a>, living conditions grew worse, and Arnhem was subsequently devastated by Allied <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery" title="Artillery">artillery fire</a> that was part of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Market_Garden" title="Operation Market Garden">Operation Market Garden</a>. During the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_famine_of_1944" title="Dutch famine of 1944">Dutch famine</a> that followed, over the winter of 1944, the Germans blocked the resupply routes of Dutch people's already limited food and fuel supplies as retaliation for railway strikes that were held to hinder the German occupation. People starved and froze to death in the streets. Hepburn and many others resorted to making flour out of tulip bulbs to bake cakes and biscuits.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn's half-brother, Ian van Ufford, spent time in a German <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbeitslager" title="Arbeitslager">labour camp</a>. Suffering from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition" title="Malnutrition">malnutrition</a>, Hepburn developed acute <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaemia" title="Anaemia">anaemia</a>, respiratory problems, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedema" title="Oedema">oedema</a>. In 1991, Hepburn said "I have memories. More than once I was at the station seeing trainloads of Jews being transported, seeing all these faces over the top of the wagon. I remember, very sharply, one little boy standing with his parents on the platform, very pale, very blond, wearing a coat that was much too big for him, and he stepped on to the train. I was a child observing a child".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One way that Audrey Hepburn passed the time was by drawing. Some of her childhood artwork can be seen today. When the country was liberated, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Relief_and_Rehabilitation_Administration" title="United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration">United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration</a> trucks followed. Hepburn said in an interview she ate an entire can of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_milk" title="Condensed milk">condensed milk</a> and then got sick from one of her first relief meals because she put too much sugar in her oatmeal. Hepburn's wartime experiences later led her to become involved with UNICEF.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_career">Early career</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1945, after the war, Hepburn left the Arnhem Conservatory and moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, where she took <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet" title="Ballet">ballet lessons</a> with Sonia Gaskell. Hepburn appeared as a stewardess in a short tourism film for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLM" title="KLM">KLM</a>, before travelling with her mother to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>. Gaskell provided an introduction to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Rambert" title="Marie Rambert">Marie Rambert</a>, and Hepburn studied ballet at the "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet_Rambert" title="Ballet Rambert">Ballet Rambert</a>", supporting herself with part time work as a model. Hepburn eventually asked Rambert about her future. Rambert assured her that she could continue to work there and have a great career, but the fact that she was relatively tall (1.7m/5Â ft 7) coupled with her poor nutrition during the war would keep her from becoming a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_ballerina" title="Prima ballerina">prima ballerina</a>. Hepburn trusted Rambert's assessment and decided to pursue acting, a career in which she at least had a chance to excel. After Hepburn became a star, Rambert said in an interview, "She was a wonderful learner. If she had wanted to persevere, she might have become an outstanding ballerina".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn's mother worked menial jobs in order to support them and Hepburn needed to find employment. Since she trained to be a performer all her life, acting seemed a sensible career. She said, "I needed the money; it paid â‚¤3 more than ballet jobs". Her acting career began with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_film" title="Educational film">educational film</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_in_Seven_Lessons" title="Dutch in Seven Lessons">Dutch in Seven Lessons</a></i> (1948). She played in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theatre" title="Musical theatre">musical theatre</a> in productions such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Button_Shoes" title="High Button Shoes">High Button Shoes</a></i> and <i>Sauce Piquante</i> in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre" title="West End theatre">West End</a>. Her theatre work revealed that her voice was not strong and needed to be developed, and during this time she took elocution lessons with the actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Aylmer" title="Felix Aylmer">Sir Felix Aylmer</a>. Part time modelling work was not always available and Hepburn registered with the casting officers of Britain's film studios in the hope of getting work as an extra.</p>

The writer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colette" title="Colette">Colette</a>, when she first saw Hepburn, reportedly said "VoilÃ ! There's our Gigi!" She won a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_World_Award" title="Theatre World Award">Theatre World Award</a> for her performance. Hepburn's first significant film performance was in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorold_Dickinson" title="Thorold Dickinson">Thorold Dickinson</a> film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_People_(film)" title="The Secret People (film)">Secret People</a></i> (1952), in which she played a prodigious ballerina. Hepburn did all of her own dancing scenes.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Her first starring role was with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Peck" title="Gregory Peck">Gregory Peck</a> in the Italian-set <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Holiday" title="Roman Holiday">Roman Holiday</a></i> (1953). Producers initially wanted <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Taylor" title="Elizabeth Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a> for the role but director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wyler" title="William Wyler">William Wyler</a> was so impressed by Hepburn's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_test" title="Screen test">screen test</a> (the camera was left on and candid footage of Hepburn relaxing and answering questions, unaware that she was still being filmed, displayed her talents), that he cast her in the lead. Wyler said, "She had everything I was looking for: charm, innocence and talent. She also was very funny. She was absolutely enchanting and we said, 'That's the girl!'"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The movie was to have had Gregory Peck's name above the title in large font with "Introducing Audrey Hepburn" beneath. After filming had been completed, Peck called his agent and, predicting correctly that Hepburn would win the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a>, had the billing changed so that her name also appeared before the title in type as large as his.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn and Peck bonded during filming and there were rumours that they were romantically involved; both denied it. Hepburn, however, added, "Actually, you have to be a little bit in love with your <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_man" title="Leading man">leading man</a> and vice versa. If you're going to portray love, you have to feel it. You can't do it any other way. But you don't carry it beyond the set". Due to the instant celebrity that came with <i>Roman Holiday</i>, Hepburn's illustration was placed on the 7 September 1953, cover of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">TIME</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn's performance received much critical praise. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A._H._Weiler&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="A.

Weiler</a> noted in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, "Although she is not precisely a newcomer to films, Audrey Hepburn, the British actress who is being starred for the first time as Princess Ann, is a slender, elfin and wistful beauty, alternately regal and childlike in her profound appreciation of newly found, simple pleasures and love. Although she bravely smiles her acknowledgement of the end of that affair, she remains a pitifully lonely figure facing a stuffy future". Hepburn would later call <i>Roman Holiday</i> her dearest movie, because it was the one that made her a star.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After filming <i>Roman Holiday</i> for four months, Hepburn returned to New York and performed in <i>Gigi</i> for eight months.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the filming of <i>Sabrina</i>, Hepburn and the already-married Holden became romantically involved and she hoped to marry him and have children.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By the mid-1950s, Hepburn was not only one of the biggest motion picture stars in Hollywood, but also a major fashion influence. Her gamine and elfin appearance and widely recognised sense of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chic_(style)" title="Chic (style)">chic</a> were both admired and imitated.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A common perception of the time was that Bogart and Hepburn did not get along; however, Hepburn has been quoted as saying, "Sometimes it's the so-called 'tough guys' that are the most tender hearted, as Bogey was with me".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Funny Face</i> in 1957 was one of Hepburn's favourites because she got to dance with Fred Astaire.

Her portrayal of Sister Luke is one of the great performances of the screen".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Frank" title="Otto Frank">Otto Frank</a> even asked her to play his daughter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Frank" title="Anne Frank">Anne's</a> onscreen counterpart in the 1959 film <i>The Diary of Anne Frank</i>, but Hepburn, who was born the same year as Anne, was almost 30 years old, and felt too old to play a teenager. The role was eventually given to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millie_Perkins" title="Millie Perkins">Millie Perkins</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn's Holly Golightly in 1961's <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i> became an iconic character in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States" title="Cinema of the United States">American cinema</a>. She called the role "the jazziest of my career". Asked about the acting challenge of the role, she replied, "I'm an introvert. Playing the extroverted girl was the hardest thing I ever did". In the film, she wore trendy clothing designed by herself and Givenchy, and added blonde streaks to her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_hair" title="Brown hair">brown hair</a>, a look that she would keep off-screen as well.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1963, Hepburn starred in <i>Charade</i>, her first and only film with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant" title="Cary Grant">Cary Grant</a>, who had previously withdrawn from the starring roles in <i>Roman Holiday</i> and <i>Sabrina</i>. He was sensitive as to their age difference and requested a script change so that Hepburn's character would be the one to romantically pursue his.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Released after <i>Charade</i> was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_When_It_Sizzles" title="Paris When It Sizzles">Paris When It Sizzles</a></i>, a film that paired Hepburn with William Holden, who nearly ten years before had been her leading man in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_(1954_film)" title="Sabrina (1954 film)">Sabrina</a></i>. The film, called "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshmallow" title="Marshmallow">marshmallow</a>-weight hokum", was "uniformly panned"; Behind the scenes, the set was plagued with problems: Holden tried without success to rekindle a romance with the now-married actress; that, combined with his alcoholism made the situation a challenge for the production. Hepburn did not help matters: after <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_photography" title="Principal photography">principal photography</a> began, she demanded the dismissal of cinematographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Renoir" title="Claude Renoir">Claude Renoir</a> after seeing what she felt were unflattering <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dailies" title="Dailies">dailies</a>. Superstitious, she insisted on dressing room 55 because that was her lucky number (she had dressing room 55 for <i>Roman Holiday</i> and <i>Breakfast at Tiffanyâ€™s</i>). She insisted that Givenchy, her long-time designer, be given a credit in the film for her perfume.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1964, Hepburn starred in <i>My Fair Lady</i> which was said to be the most anticipated movie since <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_(film)" title="Gone with the Wind (film)">Gone with the Wind</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn was cast as Eliza Doolittle instead of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Andrews" title="Julie Andrews">Julie Andrews</a>, who had originated the role <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Broadway" title="On Broadway">on Broadway</a>, but had no film experience as yet. The decision not to cast Andrews was made before Hepburn was chosen. Hepburn initially refused the role and asked <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Warner" title="Jack Warner">Jack Warner</a> to give it to Andrews, but when informed that it would either be her or <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Taylor" title="Elizabeth Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>, who was also vying for the part, she accepted the role.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The casting of a non-singer in the lead role of a major musical proved to be very controversial. Several critics felt that Hepburn was not believable as a Cockney flower girl, and that at 35 she was rather old for the part since Eliza was supposed to be about 20. However, according to an article in <i>Soundstage</i> magazine, "Everyone agreed that if Julie Andrews was not to be in the film, Audrey Hepburn was the perfect choice".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn recorded vocals, but was later told that her vocals would be replaced by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marni_Nixon" title="Marni Nixon">Marni Nixon</a>. She walked off the set but returned early the next day to apologise for her "wicked" behaviour. Footage of several songs with Hepburn's original vocals still exist and have been included in documentaries and the DVD release of the film, though to date, only Nixon's renditions have been released on LP and CD.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some of her original vocals remained in the film: a section of "Just You Wait", one line of a verse to "I Could Have Danced All Night" and the reprise of "Just You Wait". When asked about the dubbing of an actress with such distinctive vocal tones, Hepburn frowned and said, "You could tell, couldn't you? And there was Rex, recording all his songs as he actedÂ ... next timeÂ â€”" She bit her lip to keep from saying any more.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aside from the dubbing, many critics agreed that Hepburn's performance was excellent. Gene Ringgold said, "Audrey Hepburn is magnificent. She is Eliza for the ages".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The controversy over Hepburn's casting reached its height at the 1964â€“65 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> season, when Hepburn was not nominated for best actress while Andrews was, for <i>Mary Poppins</i>. The media tried to play up a rivalry between the two actresses as the ceremony approached, even though both women denied any such bad feelings existed and got along well. Andrews won the award.</p>

It was an edgy thriller in which Hepburn played the part of a blind woman being terrorised. In addition, it was produced by Mel Ferrer and filmed on the brink of their divorce. Hepburn is said to have lost fifteen pounds under the stress. On the bright side, she found co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Crenna" title="Richard Crenna">Richard Crenna</a> to be very funny, and she had a lot to laugh about with director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Young_(director)" title="Terence Young (director)">Terence Young</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 1967 onward, after fifteen highly successful years in film, Hepburn decided to devote more time to her family and acted only occasionally. After her divorce from Ferrer, she married Italian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist" title="Psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a> Dr. Andrea Dotti and had a second son, Luca, in 1970.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn's last starring role in a cinematic film was with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Gazzara" title="Ben Gazzara">Ben Gazzara</a> in the 1981 comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_All_Laughed" title="They All Laughed">They All Laughed</a></i>, directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn's last motion picture role, a cameo appearance, was as an angel in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_(1989_film)" title="Always (1989 film)">Always</a></i>, filmed in 1988.

She called it "love at first sight;" however, after having her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_dress" title="Wedding dress">wedding dress</a> fitted and the date set, she decided the marriage would not work, because the demands of their careers would keep them apart most of the time. In the early 1950s, she dated future <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_(musical)" title="Hair (musical)">Hair</a></i> producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Butler_(producer)" title="Michael Butler (producer)">Michael Butler</a>.

She had a son with eachÂ â€“ Sean in 1960 by Ferrer, and Luca in 1970 by Dotti. Her elder son's godfather was the novelist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Cronin" title="A. J. Cronin">A. J.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn met Mel Ferrer at a party hosted by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Peck" title="Gregory Peck">Gregory Peck</a>. She had seen him in the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lili" title="Lili">Lili</a></i> and was captivated by his performance. Ferrer later sent Hepburn the script for the play <i>Ondine</i> and Hepburn agreed to play the role. Rehearsals started in January 1954 and Hepburn and Ferrer were married on 24 September. Hepburn claimed that they were inseparable and were very happy together, despite the insistence from gossip columns that the marriage would not last. She did, however, admit that he had a bad temper. Ferrer was rumoured to be too controlling of Hepburn and had been referred to by others as being her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svengali" title="Svengali">Svengali</a>--an accusation that Hepburn laughed off., <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Holden" title="William Holden">William Holden</a> was quoted as saying, "I think Audrey allows Mel to think he influences her".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before having their first child, Hepburn had two miscarriages, the first in March 1955. In 1959, while filming <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unforgiven_(1960_film)" title="The Unforgiven (1960 film)">The Unforgiven</a></i>, she broke her back after falling off a horse onto a rock. She spent weeks in the hospital and later had a miscarriage that was said to have been induced by physical and mental stress. While she was resting at home, Mel Ferrer brought her the fawn from the movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Mansions_(film)" title="Green Mansions (film)">Green Mansions</a></i> to keep as a pet. They called him Ip, short for Pippin.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One year after <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> sang "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday,_Mr._President" title="Happy Birthday, Mr. President">Happy Birthday, Mr. President</a>" to President <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, Hepburn, the President's favourite actress, sang "Happy Birthday, Dear Jack" to him, on what turned out to be his final birthday (29 May 1963).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn had several pets, including a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Terrier" title="Yorkshire Terrier">Yorkshire Terrier</a> named Mr. Famous, who was hit by a car and killed. To cheer her up, Mel Ferrer got her another Yorkshire named Assam of Assam. She also kept Ip; they made a bed for him out of a bathtub. Sean Ferrer had a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocker_Spaniel" title="Cocker Spaniel">Cocker Spaniel</a> named Cokey. When Hepburn was older, she had two <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Russell_Terrier" title="Jack Russell Terrier">Jack Russell Terriers</a>. The marriage to Ferrer lasted 14 years, until 5 December 1968; their son was quoted as saying that Hepburn had stayed in the marriage too long. In the later years of the marriage, Ferrer was rumoured to have had a girlfriend on the side, while Hepburn had an affair with her <i>Two for the Road</i> co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Finney" title="Albert Finney">Albert Finney</a>. She denied the rumours, but director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Donen" title="Stanley Donen">Stanley Donen</a> said, "with Albert Finney, she was like a new woman. She and Albie have a wonderful thing together; they are like a couple of kids. When Mel wasn't on set, they sparkled. When Mel was there, it was funny. Audrey and Albie would go rather formal and a little awkward". The couple separated before divorcing.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She met Italian psychiatrist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Dotti" title="Andrea Dotti">Andrea Dotti</a> on a cruise and fell in love with him on a trip to some Greek ruins. She believed she would have more children, and possibly stop working. She married him on 18 January 1969. Although Dotti loved Hepburn and was well-liked by Sean, who called him "fun", he began having affairs with younger women. The marriage lasted thirteen years and ended in 1982, when Hepburn felt Luca and Sean were old enough to handle life with a single mother. Though Hepburn broke off all contact with Ferrer (she would only speak to him twice in the remainder of her life), she remained in touch with Dotti for the benefit of Luca. Andrea Dotti died in October 2007 from complications of a colonoscopy. Mel Ferrer died of heart failure in June 2008 at the age of ninety.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn was much more careful when she was pregnant with Luca in 1969; she rested for months and passed the time by painting before delivering Luca by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section" title="Caesarean section">caesarean section</a>.

Hepburn is associated with the poem "Time-Tested Beauty Tips" (although the author is humourist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Levenson" title="Sam Levenson">Sam Levenson</a>), which she used to recite to her sons. The poem includes verses such as, "For beautiful hair, let a child run his or her fingers through it once a day", and, "For a slim figure, share your food with the hungry".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 1980 until her death, she lived with the actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wolders" title="Robert Wolders">Robert Wolders</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soon after Hepburn's final film role, she was appointed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UNICEF_Goodwill_Ambassadors" title="List of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors">goodwill ambassador to the United Nations Children's Fund</a> (UNICEF). Grateful for her own good fortune after enduring the German occupation as a child, she dedicated the remainder of her life to helping impoverished children in the poorest nations. Hepburn's travels were made easier by her wide knowledge of languages; she spoke seven languages fluently, including French, Italian, Spanish, English, Dutch, and German.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though she had done work for UNICEF in the 1950s, starting in 1954 with radio presentations, this was a much higher level of dedication. Those close to her say that the thoughts of dying, helpless children consumed her for the rest of her life. Her first field mission was to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> in 1988. She visited an orphanage in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mek%27ele" title="Mek'ele">Mek'ele</a> that housed 500 starving children and had UNICEF send food. Of the trip, she said, "I have a broken heart. I feel desperate. I can't stand the idea that two million people are in imminent danger of starving to death, many of them children, [and] [sic] not because there isn't tons of food sitting in the northern port of Shoa. It can't be distributed. Last spring, Red Cross and UNICEF workers were ordered out of the northern provinces because of two simultaneous civil wars... I went into rebel country and saw mothers and their children who had walked for ten days, even three weeks, looking for food, settling onto the desert floor into makeshift camps where they may die. Horrible. That image is too much for me. The 'Third World' is a term I don't like very much, because we're all one world. I want people to know that the largest part of humanity is suffering".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In August 1988, Hepburn went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> on an immunization campaign. She called Turkey "the loveliest example" of UNICEF's capabilities. Of the trip, she said, "the army gave us their trucks, the fishmongers gave their wagons for the vaccines, and once the date was set, it took ten days to vaccinate the whole country. Not bad".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In October, Hepburn went to South America. In <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, Hepburn told the United States Congress, "I saw tiny mountain communities, slums, and shantytowns receive water systems for the first time by some miracleÂ â€“ and the miracle is UNICEF. I watched boys build their own schoolhouse with bricks and cement provided by UNICEF".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn toured <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a> in February 1989, and met with leaders in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras" title="Honduras">Honduras</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador" title="El Salvador">El Salvador</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala" title="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>. In April, Hepburn visited <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan" title="Sudan">Sudan</a> with Wolders as part of a mission called "Operation Lifeline". Because of civil war, food from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid_agency" title="Aid agency">aid agencies</a> had been cut off. The mission was to ferry food to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Sudan" title="Southern Sudan">southern Sudan</a>. Hepburn said, "I saw but one glaring truth: These are not <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster" title="Natural disaster">natural disasters</a> but man-made tragedies for which there is only one man-made solutionÂ â€“ peace".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In October, Hepburn and Wolders went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Isaac" title="John Isaac">John Isaac</a>, a UN photographer, said, "Often the kids would have flies all over them, but she would just go hug them.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In September 1992, four months before she died, Hepburn went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia" title="Somalia">Somalia</a>. Hepburn called it "apocalyptic" and said, "I walked into a nightmare. I have seen famine in Ethiopia and Bangladesh, but I have seen nothing like thisÂ â€“ so much worse than I could possibly have imagined. I wasn't prepared for this". "The earth is redÂ â€“ an extraordinary sightÂ â€“ that deep <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta" title="Terracotta">terracotta</a> red. And you see the villages, displacement camps and compounds, and the earth is all rippled around them like an ocean bed. And those were the graves. There are graves everywhere. Along the road, around the paths that you take, along the riverbeds, near every campÂ â€“ there are graves everywhere".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though scarred by what she had seen, Hepburn still had hope. "Taking care of children has nothing to do with politics. I think perhaps with time, instead of there being a politicization of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid" title="Humanitarian aid">humanitarian aid</a>, there will be a humanization of politics". "Anyone who doesn't believe in miracles is not a realist. I have seen the miracle of water which UNICEF has helped to make a reality. Where for centuries young girls and women had to walk for miles to get water, now they have clean drinking water near their homes. Water is life, and clean water now means health for the children of this village". "People in these places don't know Audrey Hepburn, but they recognize the name UNICEF. When they see UNICEF their faces light up, because they know that something is happening. In the Sudan, for example, they call a water <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump" title="Pump">pump</a> UNICEF".</p>

Her fashion styles also continue to be popular among women. Contrary to her recent image, although Hepburn did enjoy fashion, she did not place much importance on it. She preferred casual, comfortable clothes. In addition, she never considered herself to be very attractive. She said in a 1959 interview, "you can even say that I hated myself at certain periods. I was too fat, or maybe too tall, or maybe just plain too ugly... you can say my definiteness stems from underlying feelings of insecurity and inferiority.

It used clips of her dancing from <i>Funny Face</i>, set to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC" title="AC/DC">AC/DC</a>'s "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_in_Black_(song)" title="Back in Black (song)">Back in Black</a>", with the tagline "It's Back â€“ The Skinny Black Pant". To celebrate its "Keep it Simple" campaign, the Gap made a sizeable donation to the Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund. The "little black dress" from <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>, designed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_de_Givenchy" title="Hubert de Givenchy">Givenchy</a>, sold at a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie%27s" title="Christie's">Christie's</a> auction on 5 December 2006, for Â£467,200 (approximately $920,000), almost seven times its Â£70,000 pre-sale estimate. This is the highest price paid for a dress from a film. The proceeds went to the City of Joy Aid charity to aid underprivileged children in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>. The head of the charity said, "there are tears in my eyes. I am absolutely dumbfounded to believe that a piece of cloth which belonged to such a magical actress will now enable me to buy bricks and cement to put the most destitute children in the world into schools". The dress auctioned by Christie's was not the one that Hepburn actually wore in the movie. Of the two dresses that Hepburn did wear, one is held in the Givenchy archives, while the other is displayed in the Museum of Costume in Madrid.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A subsequent auction of Hepburn's film wardrobe, in London in December 2009, raised Â£270,200 ($437,000), including Â£60,000 for the black Chantilly lace cocktail gown from <i>How to Steal a Million</i>. Half the proceeds were donated to 'All Children in School,' a joint venture of The Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund and UNICEF.</p>
