	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crowe was born in Wellington, New Zealand, the son of Jocelyn Yvonne (nÃ©e Wemyss) and John Alexander Crowe, both of whom were movie set caterers; his father also managed a hotel.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Crowe was four years old, his family moved to Australia, where his parents pursued a career in film set catering. The producer of the Australian TV series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyforce" title="Spyforce">Spyforce</a></i> was his mother's godfather, and Crowe at age five or six was hired for a line of dialogue in one episode, opposite series star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Thompson_(actor)" title="Jack Thompson (actor)">Jack Thompson</a> (in 1994 Thompson played Crowe's father in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sum_of_Us" title="The Sum of Us">The Sum of Us</a></i>. He had been educated at the same school which Crowe was to attend for two years: <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Boys_High_School" title="Sydney Boys High School">Sydney Boys High School</a>). Crowe also appeared briefly in serial <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Young_Doctors" title="The Young Doctors">The Young Doctors</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From his youth to the present, Crowe has had a special love of horses. "They're just like people," he told <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CraveOnline" title="CraveOnline">CraveOnline</a>, "there are some horses that you have a deeper connection with immediately, and you can work on that over time." He has also noted that he sometimes finds it difficult to part with his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equine" title="Equine">equine</a> co-stars when a film <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrap_(film_industry)" title="Wrap (film industry)">wraps</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When he was 14, Crowe's family moved back to New Zealand, where he (along with his brother Terry) attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Grammar_School" title="Auckland Grammar School">Auckland Grammar School</a> with cousins <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Crowe" title="Martin Crowe">Martin Crowe</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Crowe" title="Jeff Crowe">Jeff Crowe</a>. He then continued his secondary education at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Roskill_Grammar_School" title="Mount Roskill Grammar School">Mount Roskill Grammar School</a>, which he left at age 16 to chase his dreams of becoming a musician or actor. A classmate and friend from that time, John Maloney, remembers Crowe as a "sombre, misshapen" boy who was "frequently shirtless and even more frequently sans culottes".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the mid-1980s Russell, under guidance from his good friend Tom Sharplin, performed as a rock 'n' roll revivalist, under the stage name <i>Russ Le Roq,</i> and had a New Zealand single with "<i>I Just Want To Be Like</i> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a></i>. He managed an Auckland Music Venue called "The Venue" in the mid '80s.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crowe returned to Australia at age 21, intending to apply to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Dramatic_Art" title="National Institute of Dramatic Art">National Institute of Dramatic Art</a>. "I was working in a theatre show, and talked to a guy who was then the head of technical support at NIDA," Crowe recalled. "I asked him what he thought about me spending three years at NIDA. He told me it'd be a waste of time. He said, 'You already do the things you go there to learn, and you've been doing it for most of your life, so there's nothing to teach you but bad habits.'" In 1987 Crowe spent a six-month stint as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busking" title="Busking">busker</a> when he couldn't find other work.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After appearing in the TV series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbours" title="Neighbours">Neighbours</a></i> and <i>Living with the Law,</i> Crowe was cast in his first film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crossing_(1990_film)" title="The Crossing (1990 film)">The Crossing</a></i> (1990), a small-town love triangle directed by George Ogilvie.

In 1992, Crowe starred in the first episode of the second series of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Rescue" title="Police Rescue">Police Rescue</a>.</i> Also in 1992 Crowe starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romper_Stomper" title="Romper Stomper">Romper Stomper</a></i>, an Australian film which follows the exploits and downfall of a racist skinhead group in blue-collar suburban Melbourne, directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Wright" title="Geoffrey Wright">Geoffrey Wright</a>, for which Crowe won an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Film_Institute_Awards" title="Australian Film Institute Awards">Australian Film Institute (AFI) award</a> for Best Actor, following up from his Best Supporting Actor award for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_(1991_film)" title="Proof (1991 film)">Proof</a></i> in 1991.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Hollywood">Hollywood</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After initial success in Australia, Crowe began acting in American films. He first co-starred with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington" title="Denzel Washington">Denzel Washington</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuosity" title="Virtuosity">Virtuosity</a>,</i> and with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Stone" title="Sharon Stone">Sharon Stone</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quick_and_the_Dead_(1995_film)" title="The Quick and the Dead (1995 film)">The Quick and the Dead</a></i> in 1995.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crowe received three consecutive best actor Oscar nominations for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Insider_(film)" title="The Insider (film)">The Insider</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator_(2000_film)" title="Gladiator (2000 film)">Gladiator</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(film)" title="A Beautiful Mind (film)">A Beautiful Mind</a></i>.

However he failed to win the Oscar that year, losing to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington" title="Denzel Washington">Denzel Washington</a>. It has been suggested that his attack on television producer Malcolm Gerrie for cutting short his acceptance speech may have turned voters against him.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All three films were also nominated for best picture, and both <i>Gladiator</i> and <i>A Beautiful Mind</i> won the award. Within the six year stretch from 1997â€“2003, he also starred in two other best picture nominees, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Confidential_(film)" title="L.A.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 9 March 2005, Crowe revealed to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentlemen%27s_Quarterly" title="Gentlemen's Quarterly">GQ</a></i> magazine that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> agents had approached him prior to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/73rd_Academy_Awards" title="73rd Academy Awards">73rd Academy Awards</a> on 25 March 2001 and told him that the Islamist terrorist group <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda" title="Al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> wanted to kidnap him.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crowe has been involved in a number of altercations in recent years which have given him a reputation for having a bad temper.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1999, Crowe was involved in a scuffle at the Plantation Hotel in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour,_New_South_Wales" title="Coffs Harbour, New South Wales">Coffs Harbour</a>, Australia, which was caught on security video. Two men were acquitted of using the video in an attempt to blackmail Crowe.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When part of Crowe's appearance at the 2002 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts" title="British Academy of Film and Television Arts">BAFTA</a> awards was cut out to fit into the BBC's tape-delayed broadcast, Crowe used strong language during an argument with producer Malcolm Gerrie. The part cut was a poem in tribute to actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Harris" title="Richard Harris">Richard Harris</a> who was then terminally ill, and was cut for copyright reasons. Crowe later apologised, saying "What I said to him may have been a little bit more passionate than now, in the cold light of day, I would have liked it to have been." Later that year, Crowe was alleged to have been involved in a "brawl" inside a trendy Japanese restaurant in London. The fight was broken up by British television actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Kemp" title="Ross Kemp">Ross Kemp</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In June 2005, Crowe was arrested and charged with second-degree assault by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department" title="New York City Police Department">New York City police</a>, after he threw a telephone at an employee of the Mercer Hotel who refused to help him place a call when the system did not work from his room, and was charged with fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon (the telephone). The employee, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierge" title="Concierge">concierge</a>, was treated for a facial laceration. Crowe described the incident as "possibly the most shameful situation that I've ever gotten myself in... and I've done some pretty dumb things in my life". He was sentenced to conditional release. Prior to the plea bargain, Crowe settled a lawsuit filed by the concierge, Nestor Estrada. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed but amounts in the six-figure range have been suggested.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the '80s, Crowe and friend Billy Dean Cochran formed a band, "Roman Antix", which later evolved into the Australian rock band <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Odd_Foot_of_Grunts" title="30 Odd Foot of Grunts">30 Odd Foot of Grunts</a> (TOFOG for short). Crowe performed lead vocals and guitar for the band, which formed in 1992. The band released 1995's <i>The Photograph Kills EP</i> as well as three full length records, 1998's <i>Gaslight</i>, 2001's <i>Bastard Life or Clarity</i> and 2003's <i>Other Ways of Speaking</i>. In 2000 TOFOG performed shows in London, Los Angeles and the now famous run of shows at Stubbs in Austin, TX which became a live DVD that was released in 2001 called <i>Texas</i>. In 2001 the band came to the US for major press, radio and TV appearances for the <i>Bastard Life or Clarity</i> release and returned Stubbs in Austin, TX to kick off a sold out US tour with dates in Austin, Boulder, Chicago, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, New York City and the last show at the famous Stone Pony in Asbury Park, NJ.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In early 2005, 30 Odd Foot Of Grunts as a group has "dissolved/evolved" with Russell Crowe feeling his future music would take a new direction and he began a collaboration with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Doyle" title="Alan Doyle">Alan Doyle</a> of the Canadian band <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Big_Sea" title="Great Big Sea">Great Big Sea</a>, and with it a new band: <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ordinary_Fear_of_God" title="The Ordinary Fear of God">The Ordinary Fear of God</a> which also involved some members of the previous TOFOG lineup.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In March 2010 Russell Crowe &amp; The Ordinary Fear of God's version of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williamson" title="John Williamson">John Williamson</a> song "Winter Green" was included on a new compilation album The Absolute Best of John Williamson: 40 Years True Blue, commemorating the singer/songwriters milestone of 40 years in the Australian music industry.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In May 2011 there are plans to release a new Russell Crowe &amp; The Ordinary Fear of God record (co-written with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Doyle" title="Alan Doyle">Alan Doyle</a>) and for a US Tour which would be the first live dates in the US since 2006.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film opened in US cinemas on December 21, 2001.

It was also nominated for Best Leading Actor, Best Editing, Best Makeup, and Best Score. The film has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of some aspects of Nash's life. The film fictionally portrayed his hallucinations as visual and auditory, when in fact they were exclusively auditory. Also, Nasar concluded that Nash's refusal to take drugs "may have been fortunate," since their <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect_(medicine)" title="Adverse effect (medicine)">side effects</a> "would have made his gentle re-entry into the world of mathematics a near impossibility"; in the screenplay, however, just before he receives the Nobel Prize, Nash speaks of taking "newer medications."</p>

He is a recipient of the prestigious Carnegie Prize for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>; although he was promised a single room, his roommate Charles Herman (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bettany" title="Paul Bettany">Paul Bettany</a>), a literature student, greets him as he moves in and soon becomes his best friend. Nash also meets a group of other promising math and science graduate students, Martin Hansen (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Lucas" title="Josh Lucas">Josh Lucas</a>), Richard Sol (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Goldberg" title="Adam Goldberg">Adam Goldberg</a>), Ainsley (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Gray-Stanford" title="Jason Gray-Stanford">Jason Gray-Stanford</a>), and Bender (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Rapp" title="Anthony Rapp">Anthony Rapp</a>), with whom he strikes up an awkward friendship. Nash admits to Charles that he is better with numbers than he is with people.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mathematics department chairman of Princeton informs Nash, who has missed many of his classes, that he cannot begin work until he finishes a thesis paper, prompting him to seek a truly original idea for the paper. A woman at the bar is what ultimately inspires his fruitful work in the concept of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium" title="Nash equilibrium">governing dynamics</a>, a theory in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_economics" title="Mathematical economics">mathematical economics</a>. After the conclusion of Nash's studies as a student at Princeton, he accepts a prestigious appointment at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT), along with his friends Sol and Bender.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1953, while teaching a class on calculus at MIT, he places a particularly interesting problem on the chalkboard that he dares his students to solve. He is not particularly interested in teaching and his delusions even cause him to miss the class. When a student, Alicia Larde (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Connelly" title="Jennifer Connelly">Jennifer Connelly</a>), comes to his office to discuss why he did not show up, she also asks him to dinner and the two fall in love and eventually marry.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On a return visit to Princeton, Nash runs into his former roommate Charles and meets Charles' young niece Marcee (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivien_Cardone" title="Vivien Cardone">Vivien Cardone</a>), whom he adores. Nash is invited to a secret Department of Defense facility in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon" title="The Pentagon">the Pentagon</a> to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis" title="Cryptanalysis">crack</a> a complex <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption" title="Encryption">encryption</a> of an enemy telecommunication. Nash is able to decipher the code mentally, to the astonishment of other codebreakers. Here, he encounters the mysterious William Parcher (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Harris" title="Ed Harris">Ed Harris</a>), who belongs to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" title="United States Department of Defense">United States Department of Defense</a>. Parcher observes Nash's performance from above, while partially concealed behind a screen. Parcher gives Nash a new assignment to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers, ostensibly to thwart a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> plot. He must write a report of his findings and place them in a specified mailbox. After being chased by Soviet agents and an exchange of gunfire, Nash becomes increasingly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia" title="Paranoia">paranoid</a> and begins to behave erratically.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After observing this erratic behavior, Alicia informs a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital" title="Psychiatric hospital">psychiatric hospital</a>. Later, while delivering a guest lecture at Harvard University, Nash realizes that he is being watched by a hostile group of people, and although he attempts to flee, he is forcibly sedated and sent to a psychiatric facility. Nash's internment seemingly confirms his belief that the Soviets are trying to extract information from him. He views the officials of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital" title="Psychiatric hospital">psychiatric facility</a> as Soviet kidnappers. At one point, he gorily tries to dig out of his arm an implant he received at an unused warehouse on the MIT campus which was supposedly used as a listening facility by the DoD.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alicia, desperate and obligated to help her husband, visits the mailbox and retrieves the never-opened "top secret" documents that Nash had delivered there. When confronted with this evidence, Nash is finally convinced that he has been hallucinating. The Department of Defense agent William Parcher and Nash's secret assignment to decode Soviet messages was in fact all a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion" title="Delusion">delusion</a>. Even more surprisingly, Nash's "prodigal roommate" Charles and his niece Marcee are also products of his mind.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After a series of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_shock_therapy" title="Insulin shock therapy">insulin shock therapy</a> sessions, Nash is released on the condition that he agrees to take <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic" title="Antipsychotic">antipsychotic</a> medication; however, the drugs create <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction" title="Adverse drug reaction">negative side-effects</a> that affect his sexual and emotional relationship with his wife and, most dramatically, his intellectual capacity. Frustrated, Nash secretly stops taking his medication and hoards his pills, triggering a relapse of his psychosis.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caught between the intellectual paralysis of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic" title="Antipsychotic">antipsychotic</a> drugs and his delusions, Nash and Alicia decide to try to live with his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia" title="Schizophrenia">abnormal condition</a>. Nash consciously says goodbye to the three delusional characters forever in his attempts to ignore his hallucinations and not feed "his demons". He thanks Charles for being his best friend over the years, and says a tearful goodbye to Marcee, stroking her hair and calling her "baby girl", telling them both he would not speak to them anymore. They still continue to haunt him, with Charles mocking him for cutting off their friendship, but Nash learns to ignore them.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nash eventually earns the privilege of teaching again. In 1994, Nash is honored by his fellow professors for his achievement in mathematics, and goes on to win the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Sweden_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences_in_Memory_of_Alfred_Nobel" title="Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel">Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics</a> for his revolutionary work on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory" title="Game theory">game theory</a>. Nash and Alicia are about to leave the auditorium in Stockholm, when Nash sees Charles, Marcee and Parcher standing and watching him with blank expressions on their faces. Alicia asks Nash, "What is it?" Nash replies, "Nothing. Nothing at all." With that, they both leave the auditorium.</p>

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Grazer" title="Brian Grazer">Brian Grazer</a> first read an excerpt of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Nasar" title="Sylvia Nasar">Sylvia Nasar</a>'s book <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(book)" title="A Beautiful Mind (book)">A Beautiful Mind</a></i> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)" title="Vanity Fair (magazine)">Vanity Fair</a></i>. Grazer immediately purchased the rights to the film. He eventually brought the project to Ron Howard, who had scheduling conflicts and was forced to pass. Grazer later said that many <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-list" title="A-list">A-list</a> directors were calling with their point of view on the project. He eventually focused on a particular director, who coincidentally was only available at the same time Howard was available. Grazer was forced to make a decision and chose Howard.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grazer then met with a number of screenwriters, mostly consisting of "serious dramatists", but he chose <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiva_Goldsman" title="Akiva Goldsman">Akiva Goldsman</a> instead, because of his strong passion and desire for the project. Goldsman's creative take on the project was to not allow the viewers to understand that they are viewing an alternate reality until a specific point in the film. This was done to rob the viewers of their feelings in the same way that Nash himself was. Howard agreed to direct the film based only on the first draft. He then requested that Goldsman accentuate the love story aspect.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dave Bayer, a professor of Mathematics at Barnard College, Columbia University, was consulted on the mathematical equations that appear in the film. Bayer later stated that he approached his consulting role as an actor when preparing equations, such as when Nash is forced to teach a calculus class, and arbitrarily places a complicated problem on the blackboard. Bayer focused on a character who did not want to teach ordinary details and was more concerned with what was interesting. Bayer received a cameo role in the film as a professor that lays his pen down for Nash in the pen ceremony near the end of the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Cannom" title="Greg Cannom">Greg Cannom</a> was chosen to create the makeup effects for <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>, specifically the age progression of the characters. Russell Crowe had previously worked with Cannom on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Insider_(film)" title="The Insider (film)">The Insider</a></i>. Howard had also worked with Cannom on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoon_(film)" title="Cocoon (film)">Cocoon</a></i>. Each character's stages of makeup were broken down by the number of years that would pass between levels. Cannom stressed subtlety between the stages, but worked toward the ultimate stage of "Older Nash". It was originally decided that the makeup department would merely age Russell Crowe throughout the film; however, at Crowe's request, the makeup purposefully pulled Crowe's look towards the facial features of the real John Nash. Cannom developed a new silicone-type makeup that could simulate real skin and be used for overlapping applications, shortening the application time from eight hours to four hours. Crowe was also fitted with a number of dentures to give him a slight <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion" title="Malocclusion">overbite</a> throughout the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Howard and Grazer chose frequent collaborator <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Horner" title="James Horner">James Horner</a> to score the film because of familiarity and his ability to communicate. Howard said, regarding Horner, "It's like having a conversation with a writer or an actor or another director." A running discussion between the director and the composer was the concept of high-level mathematics being less about numbers and solutions, and more akin to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope" title="Kaleidoscope">kaleidoscope</a>, in that the ideas evolve and change. After the first screening of the film, Horner told Howard: "I see changes occurring like fast-moving weather systems." He chose it as another theme to connect to Nash's ever-changing character. Horner chose Welsh singer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Church" title="Charlotte Church">Charlotte Church</a> to sing the soprano vocals after deciding that he needed a balance between a child and adult singing voice. He wanted a "purity, clarity and brightness of an instrument" but also a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrato" title="Vibrato">vibrato</a> to maintain the humanity of the voice.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was shot 90% chronologically. Three separate trips were made to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a> campus. During filming, Howard decided that Nash's delusions should always first be introduced audibly and then visually. This not only provides a visual clue, but establishes the delusions from Nash's point of view. The real John Nash's delusions were also only auditory. A technique was also developed to visualize Nash's epiphanies. After speaking to a number of mathematicians who described it as "the smoke clearing", "flashes of light" and "everything coming together", the filmmakers decided upon a flash of light appearing over an object or person to signify Nash's creativity at work. Two night shots were done at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairleigh_Dickinson_University" title="Fairleigh Dickinson University">Fairleigh Dickinson University</a>'s campus in Florham Park, NJ, in the Vanderbilt Mansion ballroom.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The producers had not originally thought of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Connelly" title="Jennifer Connelly">Jennifer Connelly</a> for the role of Alicia.

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Divergence_from_actual_events">Divergence from actual events</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The narrative of the film differs considerably from the actual events of Nash's life. The film has been criticized for this, but the filmmakers had consistently said that the film was not meant to be a literal representation. One difficulty was in portraying stress and mental illness within one person's mind. Sylvia Nasar stated that the filmmakers "invented a narrative that, while far from a literal telling, is true to the spirit of Nash's story". The film made his hallucinations visual and auditory when, in fact, they were exclusively auditory. Furthermore, while in real life Nash spent his years between Princeton and MIT as a consultant for the RAND Corporation in California, in the film he is portrayed to have worked for the Pentagon instead. It is true that his handlers, both from faculty and administration, had to introduce him to assistants and strangers. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS" title="PBS">PBS</a> documentary <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brilliant_Madness" title="A Brilliant Madness">A Brilliant Madness</a></i> attempts to portray his life more accurately.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The differences were substantial. Few if any of the characters in the film, besides John and Alicia Nash, corresponded directly to actual people. The discussion of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium" title="Nash equilibrium">Nash equilibrium</a> was criticized as over-simplified. In the film, schizophrenic hallucinations appeared while he was in graduate school, when in fact they did not show up until some years later. No mention is made of Nash's supposed homosexual experiences at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND" title="RAND">RAND</a>, which Nash and his wife both denied. Nash also fathered a son, John David Stier (born June 19, 1953), by Eleanor Agnes Stier (1921â€“2005), a nurse whom he abandoned when informed of her pregnancy.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The movie also did not include Alicia's divorce of John in 1963. It was not until Nash won the Nobel Memorial Prize that they renewed their relationship, although she allowed him to live with her as a boarder beginning in 1970. They remarried in 2001.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During graduate school, it appears in the movie that Nash was averse to game playing, when, in fact, according to Nasar's biography, he spent many hours playing games and even created a new game called "John" or "Nash" (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)" title="Hex (board game)">Hex</a>). Interestingly, the game was somewhat similar to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" title="Go (game)">Go</a>, but the shape of the squares became hexagons. The game, somewhat in conflict with the movie's mathematical point, was not one in which "nobody wins," but was "a zero-sum two-person game with perfect information in which one player always has a winning strategy" (p.Â 77).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nash is shown to join Wheeler Laboratory at MIT, but there is no such lab. He was appointed as C.L.E. Moore Instructor at MIT. The pen ceremony tradition at Princeton shown in the film is completely fictitious. In 1947, the theory of a triple helix had not been proposed yet, yet Ainsley's tie appears to have triple helices on it; <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-stranded_DNA" title="Triple-stranded DNA">Triple-stranded DNA</a> was hypothesized during the 1950s but was not formally proposed until 1952 by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling" title="Linus Pauling">Linus Pauling</a> in <i>Nature</i>. The film has Nash saying around the time of his Nobel prize in 1994: "I take the newer medications", when in fact Nash did not take any medication from 1970 onwards, something Nash's biography highlights. Howard later stated that they added the line of dialogue because it was felt as though the film was encouraging the notion that all schizophrenics can overcome their illness without medication. Nash also never gave an acceptance speech for his Nobel prize. Around the time of the Oscar nominations, Nash was accused of being <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-semitic" title="Anti-semitic">anti-semitic</a>. Nash denied this and it was speculated that the accusation was designed to affect the votes inside the Academy Awards.</p>
