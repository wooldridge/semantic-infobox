      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Gregory Peck</b> (April 5, 1916 â€“ June 12, 2003) was an American <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor" title="Actor">actor</a>.</p>

His notable performances include that of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atticus_Finch" title="Atticus Finch">Atticus Finch</a> in the 1962 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_(film)" title="To Kill a Mockingbird (film)">To Kill a Mockingbird</a></i>, for which he won his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a>.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peck was born <b>Eldred Gregory Peck</b> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego" title="San Diego">San Diego</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>'s seaside community of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Jolla" title="La Jolla">La Jolla</a>, the son of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri" title="Missouri">Missouri</a>-born Bernice Mae "Bunny" (nÃ©e Ayres) and Gregory Pearl Peck, who was a chemist and pharmacist. Peck's father was of English (paternal) and Irish (maternal) heritage, and his mother was of Scots (paternal) and English (maternal) ancestry. Peck's father was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism" title="Roman Catholicism">Catholic</a> and his mother converted upon marrying his father. Peck's Irish-born paternal grandmother, Catherine Ashe, was related to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Ashe" title="Thomas Ashe">Thomas Ashe</a>, who took part in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Rising" title="Easter Rising">Easter Rising</a> fewer than three weeks after Peck's birth and died while on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_strike" title="Hunger strike">hunger strike</a> in 1917. Peck's parents divorced by the time he was six years old and he spent the next few years being raised by his maternal grandmother.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peck was sent to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> military school, St. John's Military Academy, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> at the age of 10. His grandmother died while he was enrolled there, and his father again took over his upbringing. At 14, Peck attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_High_School" title="San Diego High School">San Diego High School</a> and lived with his father. When he graduated, he enrolled briefly at San Diego State Teacher's College, (now known as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_State_University" title="San Diego State University">San Diego State University</a>), joined the track team, took his first theatre and public-speaking courses, and joined the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epsilon_Eta&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Epsilon Eta (page does not exist)">Epsilon Eta</a> fraternity. He stayed for just one academic year, thereafter obtaining admission to his first-choice college, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="University of California, Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>. For a short time, he took a job driving a truck for an oil company. In 1936, he declared himself a pre-medical student at Berkeley, and majored in English. Since he was 6'3" and very strong, he also decided to row on the university crew.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Partly because of Peck's stature, the Berkeley acting coach decided Peck would be perfect for university theater work. Peck developed an interest in acting and was recruited by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Duerr" title="Edwin Duerr">Edwin Duerr</a>, director of the university's Little Theater. He went on to appear in five plays during his senior year. Although his tuition fee was only $26 a year, Peck still struggled to pay, and had to work as a "hasher" (kitchen helper) for the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority in exchange for meals. Peck would later say about Berkeley that, "it was a very special experience for me and three of the greatest years of my life. It woke me up and made me a human being." In 1997, he donated $25,000 to the Berkeley crew in honor of his coach, the renowned <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky_Ebright" title="Ky Ebright">Ky Ebright</a>.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After graduating from Berkeley with a BA degree in English, Peck dropped the name "Eldred" and headed to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> to study at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_Playhouse" title="Neighborhood Playhouse">Neighborhood Playhouse</a> with the legendary acting teacher <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_Meisner" title="Sanford Meisner">Sanford Meisner</a>. He was often broke and sometimes slept in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park" title="Central Park">Central Park</a>. He worked at the 1939 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Fair" title="World's Fair">World's Fair</a> and as a tour guide for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a>'s television broadcasting.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His early career started in 1941 by playing the secretary in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Cornell" title="Katharine Cornell">Katharine Cornell</a> production of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw" title="George Bernard Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>'s play <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doctor%27s_Dilemma_(play)" title="The Doctor's Dilemma (play)">The Doctor's Dilemma</a>.

He made his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut as the lead in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emlyn_Williams" title="Emlyn Williams">Emlyn Williams</a>' <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Morning_Star_(play)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="The Morning Star (play) (page does not exist)">The Morning Star</a></i> in 1942. His second Broadway performance that year was in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Willow_and_I&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="The Willow and I (page does not exist)">The Willow and I</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Pawley" title="Edward Pawley">Edward Pawley</a>. Peck's acting abilities were in high demand during <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, since he was exempt from military service owing to a back injury suffered while receiving dance and movement lessons from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Graham" title="Martha Graham">Martha Graham</a> as part of his acting training. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentieth_Century_Fox" title="Twentieth Century Fox">Twentieth Century Fox</a> claimed he had injured his back while rowing at university, but in Peck's words, "In Hollywood, they didn't think a dance class was macho enough, I guess. I've been trying to straighten out that story for years."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1949, Peck founded <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_La_Jolla_Playhouse" title="The La Jolla Playhouse">The La Jolla Playhouse</a>, at his birthplace, along with his friends <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Ferrer" title="Mel Ferrer">Mel Ferrer</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_McGuire" title="Dorothy McGuire">Dorothy McGuire</a>. This local community theater and landmark (now in a new home at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego" title="University of California, San Diego">University of California, San Diego</a>) still thrives today. It has attracted <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> film stars on hiatus both as performers and enthusiastic supporters since its inception.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peck's first film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_of_Glory_(1944_film)" title="Days of Glory (1944 film)">Days of Glory</a></i>, was released in 1944. He was nominated for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Best Actor</a> five times, four of which came in his first five years of film acting: for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keys_of_the_Kingdom_(film)" title="The Keys of the Kingdom (film)">The Keys of the Kingdom</a></i> (1944), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yearling_(film)" title="The Yearling (film)">The Yearling</a></i> (1946), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman%27s_Agreement" title="Gentleman's Agreement">Gentleman's Agreement</a></i> (1947), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_O%27Clock_High" title="Twelve O'Clock High">Twelve O'Clock High</a></i> (1949).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Keys of the Kingdom</i> emphasized his stately presence. As the farmer Ezra "Penny" Baxter in <i>The Yearling</i> his good-humored warmth and affection toward the characters playing his son and wife confounded critics who had been insisting he was a lifeless performer. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel_in_the_Sun_(film)" title="Duel in the Sun (film)">Duel in the Sun</a></i> (1946) showed his range as an actor in his first "against type" role as a cruel, libidinous gunslinger. <i>Gentleman's Agreement</i> established his power in the "social conscience" genre in a film that took on the deep-seated but subtle anti-Semitism of mid-century corporate America.<i>Twelve O'Clock High</i> was the first of many successful war films in which Peck embodied the brave, effective, yet human fighting man.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among his other films were <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellbound_(1945_film)" title="Spellbound (1945 film)">Spellbound</a></i> (1945), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradine_Case" title="The Paradine Case">The Paradine Case</a></i> (1947), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gunfighter" title="The Gunfighter">The Gunfighter</a></i> (1950), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Dick_(1956_film)" title="Moby Dick (1956 film)">Moby Dick</a></i> (1956), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Beach_(1959_film)" title="On the Beach (1959 film)">On the Beach</a></i> (1959), which brought to life the terrors of global nuclear war, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guns_of_Navarone_(film)" title="The Guns of Navarone (film)">The Guns of Navarone</a></i> (1961), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Holiday" title="Roman Holiday">Roman Holiday</a></i> (1953), with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn" title="Audrey Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a> in her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Oscar</a>-winning role. Peck and Hepburn were close friends until her death; Peck even introduced her to her first husband, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Ferrer" title="Mel Ferrer">Mel Ferrer</a>. Peck once again teamed up with director William Wyler in the epic Western <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Country" title="The Big Country">The Big Country</a></i> (1958), which he co-produced.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peck won the Academy award with his fifth nomination, playing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atticus_Finch" title="Atticus Finch">Atticus Finch</a>, a Depression-era lawyer and widowed father, in a film adaptation of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_Lee" title="Harper Lee">Harper Lee</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel" title="Novel">novel</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird" title="To Kill a Mockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a></i>. Released in 1962 during the height of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_civil_rights_movement" title="US civil rights movement">US civil rights movement</a> in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Southern_States" title="U.S. Southern States">South</a>, this movie and his role were Peck's favorites. In 2003, Atticus Finch was named the top film hero of the past 100 years by the American Film Institute.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He served as the president of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences" title="Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> in 1967, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman" title="Chairman">Chairman</a> of the Board of Trustees of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a> from 1967 to 1969, Chairman of the Motion Picture and Television Relief Fund in 1971, and National Chairman of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society" title="American Cancer Society">American Cancer Society</a> in 1966. He was a member of the National Council on the Arts from 1964 to 1966.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A physically powerful man, he was known to do a majority of his own fight scenes, rarely using body or stunt doubles. In fact, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mitchum" title="Robert Mitchum">Robert Mitchum</a>, his on-screen opponent in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Fear_(1962_film)" title="Cape Fear (1962 film)">Cape Fear</a></i>, often said that when Peck once accidentally punched him for real during their final fight scene in the movie, he felt the impact for days afterward.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peck's rare attempts at unsympathetic albeit provocative roles usually fell short. Early on, he played the renegade son in the Western <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel_in_the_Sun_(film)" title="Duel in the Sun (film)">Duel in the Sun</a></i> and, later in his career, the infamous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_from_Brazil_(film)" title="The Boys from Brazil (film)">The Boys from Brazil</a></i> co-starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 1980s, Peck moved to television, where he starred in the mini-series <i>The Blue and the Gray</i>, playing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. He also starred with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Plummer" title="Christopher Plummer">Christopher Plummer</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_John_Gielgud" title="Sir John Gielgud">Sir John Gielgud</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Bouchet" title="Barbara Bouchet">Barbara Bouchet</a> in the television film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet_and_The_Black" title="The Scarlet and The Black">The Scarlet and The Black</a></i>, about a real-life Roman Catholic priest in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City" title="Vatican City">Vatican</a> who smuggled Jews and other refugees away from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism" title="Nazism">Nazis</a> during <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, and Martin Balsam all had roles in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Fear_(1991_film)" title="Cape Fear (1991 film)">1991 remake of <i>Cape Fear</i></a> directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>.

In the remake, Peck plays Max Cady's lawyer.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His last prominent role also came in 1991 in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_People%27s_Money" title="Other People's Money">Other People's Money</a></i>, a film directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Jewison" title="Norman Jewison">Norman Jewison</a> based on the stage play of that name. Peck played a business owner trying to save his company against a hostile takeover bid by a Wall Street liquidator played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_DeVito" title="Danny DeVito">Danny DeVito</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peck retired from active film-making at that point.
