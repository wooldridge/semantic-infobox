				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>James Francis Cagney, Jr.</b> (July 17,
					1899 – March 30, 1986) was an American film star who won acclaim for a wide
					variety of roles, including the career-launching <i>
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Public_Enemy" title="The Public Enemy">The Public Enemy</a>
					</i>. He was an accomplished <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> performer, nominated for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a> three
					times in different decades, winning once for his portrayal of a song-and-dance
					man in 1942 in <i>
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Doodle_Dandy" title="Yankee Doodle Dandy">Yankee Doodle Dandy</a>
					</i>, but is still best known for his 'tough guy' roles. Like <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart_(actor)" title="James Stewart (actor)">James Stewart</a>, Cagney became so familiar
					to audiences that they usually referred to him as "Jimmy" Cagney — a billing
					never found on any of his films.</p>

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney was among <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick" title="Stanley Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>'s favorite actors and was declared by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</a> as "maybe the greatest actor to ever

					ship captain while his maternal grandmother was an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_American" title="Irish American">Irish American</a>. The family moved twice when Cagney was still young,
					first to East Seventy-Ninth Street, and then to East Ninety-Sixth Street. Cagney
					was the second of seven children, two of whom died within months of birth;
					Cagney himself had been very sick as a young child, so much so that his mother
					feared he would die before being christened, all of which was a product of the
					level of poverty in which they grew up. All the children were raised as
					Catholic, all receiving <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist" title="Eucharist">Holy
						Communion</a> and all being confirmed.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The red-haired, blue-eyed Cagney graduated
					from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuyvesant_High_School" title="Stuyvesant High School">Stuyvesant High School</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York,_New_York" title="New York, New York">New York City</a> in 1918 and attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_College_of_Columbia_University" title="Columbia College of Columbia University">Columbia College of Columbia
						University</a>, where he intended to major in art. He also took German and
					joined the Student Army Training Corps. He dropped out after one semester and
					returned home upon the death of his father in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu" title="Spanish flu">Spanish
						flu</a> epidemic.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He had a range of jobs early in his life,
					all contributing to the family fund: junior architect, copy boy for the <i>
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Sun" title="New York Sun">New York Sun</a>
					</i>, book custodian at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Public_Library" title="New York Public Library">New York Public Library</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellhop" title="Bellhop">bellhop</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_drawing" title="Technical drawing">draughtsman</a> and a night doorman. Cagney
					believed in hard work: "It was good for me. I feel sorry for the kid who has too
					cushy a time of it. Suddenly he has to come to face-to-face with the realities
					of life without any mama or papa to do his thinking for him."</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He started <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_dance" title="Tap dance">tap
						dancing</a> as a boy (a skill that would eventually contribute to his
					Academy Award) and was nicknamed 'Cellar-Door Cagney' after his habit of dancing
					on slanted cellar doors. He was a good street fighter, fighting on his older
					med-student brother Harry's behalf when it was required, taking on all-comers as
					necessary. He engaged in amateur boxing, including a runner-up in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State" title="New York State">New York State</a> lightweight title. He was good
					enough for his coaches to encourage him to turn professional, though his mother
					would not let him. He played semi-professional baseball for a local side, and
					indeed was good enough to entertain dreams of playing in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball" title="Major League Baseball">Major Leagues</a>.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His introduction to films was unusual; when
					visiting an aunt in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>
					who lived opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitagraph_Studios" title="Vitagraph Studios">Vitagraph Studios</a>, Cagney would climb over the
					fence to watch the filming of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bunny" title="John Bunny">John
						Bunny</a> films. He became involved in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_theatre" title="Community theatre">amateur dramatics</a>, starting as a scenery boy
					for a Chinese pantomime at the London Hill <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_movement" title="Settlement movement">Settlement House</a>, where his brother, Harry,
					was on-stage. He was quite happy working behind the scenes, he had no interest
					in performing. One night, however, he stood in for Harry, who had been taken
					ill. James was not an understudy, but his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory" title="Eidetic memory">photographic memory</a> of rehearsals allowed him to stand in for his
					brother without making a mistake. After that he joined as a performer, in a
					variety of roles for a number of companies.</p>
			</wiki:personal>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While working at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanamaker%27s" title="Wanamaker's">Wanamaker's</a> Department Store in 1919, Cagney learned (from a work colleague
				who had already seen him dance) of a role in the upcoming <i>Every Sailor</i> based
				on <i>Every Woman</i>, a war-time play in which the chorus is made up of servicemen
				dressed as women. Cagney auditioned for the role of a chorus-girl, despite
				considering it a waste of time because he only knew one <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_move" title="Dance move">dance
				step</a>, the Peabody, a complicated step which he knew perfectly. However, the step
				was enough to convince that he could dance, copying other dancers moves while
				waiting to go on. He didn't find it odd, nor was he embarrassed at playing a woman
				on stage, and recalled later how he was able to shed his own natural shy persona
				when he stepped onto the stage:</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Had Cagney's mother had her way, his stage
				career would have ended when he quit <i>Every Sailor</i> after two months; proud as
				she was of his performance, she felt it better that he get an education. Cagney
				though appreciated the money, $35 a week, "A mountain of money for me in those
				worrisome days." In deference to his mother's worries, he got yet another job, this
				time as a brokerage house runner. This didn't stop him looking for more stage work
				though, and he went on and successfully auditioned for a chorus part in <i>Pitter
					Patter</i>, for which he earned $55 a week, sending $40 a week back to his
				mother. So strong was his habit of working more than one job at a time, he also
				acted as a dresser for one of the leads, portering the casts' luggage and
				understudying the lead. Amongst the chorus line was 16 year-old Frances Willard
				'Billie' Vernon, whom he would marry in 1922. The show began a 10 year association
				with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Pitter Patter</i> was not hugely successful,
				but did well enough to run for 32 weeks and allowed Cagney to join the vaudeville
				circuit. Cagney and Vernon toured separately with a number of different troupes,
				reuniting as <i>Vernon and Nye</i> to do simple comedy routines and musical numbers.
				The <i>Nye</i> was a rearrangement of the last syllable of Cagney's surname. One of
				the troupes that Cagney would join was <i>Parker, Rand and Leach</i> when Leach
				left. Leach was Archie Leach, who went on to fame as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant" title="Cary Grant">Cary
				Grant</a>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After more years of touring, performing and
				struggling to make money to live and survive, Cagney and Vernon moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne,_California" title="Hawthorne, California">Hawthorne, California</a> in 1924, partly for
				Cagney to meet his new mother-in-law who had just moved there from Chicago and
				partly to investigate breaking into the movies. Their train fares were paid for by a
				friend, the press officer of <i>Pitter Patter</i> who was also desperate to break
				into acting and felt that Hollywood was the place to do it. They were not very
				successful; Cagney's dance studio had few clients and folded, he and Vernon toured
				the studios but could get no interest. Eventually they borrowed some money and
				headed back to New York and vaudeville via Chicago and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee" title="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>,
				enduring failure along the way attempting to make money on the stage.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney secured his first significant non dancing
				role in 1925. He played a young tough guy in the three act play by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Anderson" title="Maxwell Anderson">Maxwell Anderson</a>, <i>Outside Looking In</i>,
				earning $200 a week. As with <i>Pitter Patter</i>, Cagney went to the audition with
				little confidence of getting the part; this was drama, not vaudeville. Cagney felt
				that he only got the part of 'Little Red' as he was one of the two red-headed
				performers in New York, and assumed he got the part because his hair was redder than
				Alan Bunce's. Nevertheless, the play generally, and Cagney in particular, received
				good reviews: <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)" title="Life (magazine)">Life</a>
				</i> magazine wrote: "Mr Cagney, in a less spectacular role [than his co-star] makes
				a few minutes silence during his mock-trial scene something that many a more
				established actor might watch with profit", Burns Mantle that it "contained the most
				honest acting now to be seen in New York".</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney went back to vaudeville following the
				show's four month run, for the next couple of years, again with varied success, but
				off the back of <i>Outside Looking In</i> the Cagney's were much better able to pay
				their bills. During this period, Cagney met <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Cohan" title="George M. Cohan">George M. Cohan</a>, whom he would go on to portray in Yankee Doodle Dandy,
				though they never actually spoke.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney secured the lead role in the 1926-27
				season <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre" title="West End theatre">West End</a> production of <i>Broadway</i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Abbott" title="George Abbott">George Abbott</a>. However, despite Cagney's discomfort in
				doing so, the show's management insisted that Cagney copy Broadway lead <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Tracy" title="Lee Tracy">Lee Tracy</a>'s performance. The day before the show sailed for England, the
				management decided that Cagney should be replaced. This was a devastating turn of
				events for Cagney. Apart from the logistical difficulties this presented (their
				luggage was in the hold of the ship and they had given up their apartment), he
				almost quit show business. As Billie recalled:</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Cagneys had run-of-the-play contracts,
				Billie was in the chorus line of the show, and with help from the Actors Equity
				Association, Cagney took up the understudy role to Tracy on the Broadway show,
				providing them with a desperately needed steady income. Cagney also set-up a dance
				school for professionals to expand their skills. He then picked up another role in
				the play <i>Women Go On Forever</i>, directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cromwell_(director)" title="John Cromwell (director)">John Cromwell</a>, that ran for four months. By
				the end of the run, Cagney was exhausted after both acting and running the dance
				school.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He had built up a reputation as an innovative
				teacher, and so when he was cast as the lead in <i>Grand Street Follies of 1928</i>
				he also was appointed the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choreographer" title="Choreographer">choreographer</a>, and the show got rave reviews. This was followed by <i>Grand
					Street Follies of 1929</i>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These led to a part in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kelly" title="George Kelly">George
					Kelly's</a>
				<i>Maggie the Magnificent</i>, a play not liked by the critics, although Cagney's
				performance was. Cagney saw this role, (and <i>Women Go on Forever</i>) as
				significant because of the talent that directed them, he learned "what a director
				was for and what a director could do. They were directors who could play all the
				parts in the play better than the actors cast for them."</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Playing opposite Cagney in <i>Maggie the
					Magnificent</i> was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Blondell" title="Joan Blondell">Joan
					Blondell</a>, and the two were reunited a few months later in Marie Baumer's new
				play <i>Penny Arcade</i>, a show that would change Cagney's life, and ensured that
				he would never know poverty again.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the critics did not take to <i>Penny
					Arcade</i>, Cagney and Blondell were both highly praised. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jolson" title="Al Jolson">Al Jolson</a>,
				sensing a potential film success, bought the rights for $20,000 and sold the play to
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Brothers" title="Warner Brothers">Warner Brothers</a> with the stipulation that Cagney and
				Blondell be cast in the film version, which became <i>Sinners' Holiday</i> and was
				released in 1930. Cagney was given a $500-a-week, three-week contract. Cagney's
				character, Harry Delano, is a tough guy who ends up a killer, but generates sympathy
				because of his upbringing, and so Cagney's first screen role awakened a response
				that other roles would through his career, that of sympathy for the 'bad' guy.
				Cagney would also demonstrate the stubbornness that would also characterise his
				career during filming; arguing with director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adolfi" title="John Adolfi">John
					Adolfi</a> about a line:</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite this outburst, the studio liked him, and
				before his three-week contract was up and while shooting was still going on on the
				film, they gave Cagney a three-week extension and then a full seven-year contract at
				$400 a week. It was not all great for Cagney however; the contract allowed Warner to
				drop him at the end of any 40-week period, effectively guaranteeing him 40 weeks
				income and after that there would be no further guarantees. As when he was growing
				up, Cagney shared his money with his family.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the good reviews that Cagney received, he
				immediately starred in another gangster role in <i>Doorway to Hell</i> which was a
				financial hit, helping cement Cagney's growing reputation. He made four more movies
				before his breakthrough role.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Warner Brothers′ succession of gangster movie
				hits, in particular <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Caesar_(film)" title="Little Caesar (film)">Little Caesar</a>
				</i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_G._Robinson" title="Edward G. Robinson">Edward G. Robinson</a>, and Cagney's strong reviews
				in gangster movies in his short film career came together in the 1931 film <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Public_Enemy" title="The Public Enemy">The Public Enemy</a>
				</i>. Cagney was cast to play the role of nice-guy Matt Doyle, opposite Edward
				Woods' role of Tom Powers. However, after the initial rushes, the two were swapped.
				The film was low budget, costing only $151,000 to make, but went on to gross over $1
				million, one of the first low budget films to do so.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the quality of the film itself was not
				realized until much later, Cagney's performance certainly was. The <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Herald_Tribune" title="New York Herald Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a>
				</i> described Cagney's performance as "the most ruthless, unsentimental appraisal
				of the meanness of a petty killer the cinema has yet devised." Cagney received top
				billing for the film and while he acknowledged the importance of the role to his
				career, he always disputed that the role changed the way heroes and leading men were
				portrayed, citing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gable" title="Clark Gable">Clark
					Gable</a>'s slapping of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Stanwyck" title="Barbara Stanwyck">Barbara Stanwyck</a> six months earlier (in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Nurse_(1931_film)" title="Night Nurse (1931 film)">Night Nurse</a>
				</i>) as more important. Nevertheless, the scene where Cagney smashes a grapefruit
				into <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_Clarke" title="Mae Clarke">Mae Clarke</a>'s face is viewed by many critics as a one of
				the most famous moments in movie history. The scene itself was a very late addition.
				Who actually thought of the idea is a matter of debate; producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darryl_Zanuck" title="Darryl Zanuck">Darryl
					Zanuck</a> claimed he thought of the idea in a script conference, Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wellman" title="William Wellman">William Wellman</a> claimed that the idea came to him
				when he saw the grapefruit on the table during the shoot, and the writers Glasmon
				and Bright claimed the scene was based on the real life of small-time gangster Hymie
				Weiss who threw an omelette into the face of his girlfriend of the time. Cagney
				himself usually cited the writers' version, but the fruit's victim, Clarke, agreed
				that it was Wellman's idea, saying "I'm sorry I ever agreed to do the grapefruit
				bit. I never dreamed it would be shown in the movie. Director Bill Wellman thought
				of the idea suddenly. It wasn't even written into the script."</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The impact of the scene was such that
				film-makers have repeated its violence many times in cinema history; <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Marvin" title="Lee Marvin">Lee Marvin</a>'s scalding coffee into the face of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Grahame" title="Gloria Grahame">Gloria Grahame</a> in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Heat" title="The Big Heat">The Big Heat</a>
				</i> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Widmark" title="Richard Widmark">Richard Widmark</a>'s pushing of an old lady down the
				stairs in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_of_Death_(1947_film)" title="Kiss of Death (1947 film)">Kiss of Death</a>
				</i> both took their influence from Cagney's portrayal of Tom Powers. Cagney himself
				was offered grapefruit in almost every restaurant he went in for years after, and
				Clarke claimed it virtually ruined her career due to typecasting.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney's stubbornness was starting to become
				well known behind the scenes, not least after his refusal to join in a 100%
				participation charity drive that was being pushed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Fairbanks,_Jr." title="Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.">Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.</a>. Donating money to
				charity wasn't the issue, being forced to was. Already he had acquired the nickname
				'The Professional Againster'.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Warners were quick to combine their two rising
				'gangster' stars in Cagney and Robinson for Cagney's next film (for which he
				received second billing) <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Money_(film)" title="Smart Money (film)">Smart Money</a>
				</i> in 1931. So keen were the studio to follow up the success of Robinson's
					<i>Little Caesar</i> that Cagney actual shot <i>Smart Money</i> at the same time
				as <i>The Public Enemy</i>. As in <i>The Public Enemy</i>, Cagney is required to be
				physically violent to a woman, this time slapping co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evalyn_Knapp" title="Evalyn Knapp">Evalyn
					Knapp</a>, a signal that Warners were keen to keep Cagney in the public eye.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the introduction of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Motion_Picture_Production_Code_of_1930" title="United States Motion Picture Production Code of 1930">United States
					Motion Picture Production Code of 1930</a>, and particularly its edicts
				concerning on-screen violence, Warners decided to allow Cagney a change of pace, and
				cast him in the comedy <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blonde_Crazy" title="Blonde Crazy">Blonde Crazy</a>
				</i>, again opposite Blondell.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As he completed filming of this comedy, <i>The
					Public Enemy</i> was filling cinemas with all-night showings and Cagney began to
				compare his pay with his peers, thinking his contract allowed for salary adjustments
				based on the success of his films. Warners disagreed, however, and refused to a pay
				raise, and also insisted that Cagney continue promoting studio films, even the ones
				he wasn't in, something he was opposed to. Cagney wasn't prepared to be pushed
				around, however, and packed his trunks, left his apartment to his brother Bill to
				look after, and returned to New York with Billie.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the Cagneys were in New York, brother
				Bill, who had effectively become James' agent, started talks with the studio about a
				substantial pay rise and more personal freedom. Warner's hand was forced by the
				success of <i>Blonde Crazy</i>, and they eventually offered Cagney an improved
				contract of $1000 a week.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His first film on his return from New York was
				the 1932 film <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi!" title="Taxi!">Taxi!</a>
				</i>, a significant film for two reasons: it was the first time that Cagney danced
				on screen and secondly it was the last time he would allow himself to be shot at
				with live ammunition, which was a common occurrence at the time, before blank
				cartridges and squibs had been perfected. He had experienced it in <i>The Public
					Enemy</i>, but this time he almost got hit. In his opening scene, Cagney spoke
				fluent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish" title="Yiddish">Yiddish</a>, a language he picked up during his boyhood in New
				York City. The film was again praised by critics, and Warners had another hit on
				their hands, and was swiftly followed by <i>The Crowd Roars</i> and <i>Winner Takes
					All</i>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Taxi</i> was the source of one of Cagney's
				most misquoted lines. Cagney never actually said, "Oooh, you dirty rat!", a line
				commonly used by impressionists; the closest he got to it was the line in
					<i>Taxi</i> "Come out and take it, you dirty, yellow-bellied rat, or I'll give
				it to you through the door!"</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite this success, Cagney was not happy with
				his contract, wanting more money for his successful films and offering to take a
				smaller salary should his star wane in the future. Warners refused, and so Cagney
				once again walked out. He was holding out for $4000 a week, the same amount as
				Edward G. Robinson, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Francis" title="Kay Francis">Kay
					Francis</a>. Warners this time refused to cave in, and suspended Cagney. Cagney
				announced that he would do his next three pictures for free if Warners canceled the
				remaining five years on his contract. He also threatened to quit Hollywood and go
				back to Columbia University and follow his brothers into medicine. After six months
				of suspension, a deal, brokered by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra" title="Frank Capra">Frank
					Capra</a>, saw Cagney receiving an improved salary of around $3000 a week and a
				guarantee of no more than four films a year and top billing.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney, having learned about the block-booking
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_system" title="Studio system">studio system</a> that almost guaranteed them huge
				profits, was determined to spread the wealth. He would also send money and goods to
				old friends from his neighborhood, though he did not generally make this known.
				Cagney's insistence on no more than four films a year was based on his experience of
				the Hollywood acting trade where actors—even teenagers—would regularly work 100
				hours a week turning out films. This experience would also be an integral part of
				his involvement in the formation of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild" title="Screen Actors Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a>, which came into existence
				in 1933.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney returned to the studio and made <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_to_Handle" title="Hard to Handle">Hard to Handle</a>
				</i>, followed by a steady stream of films, including the highly regarded <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footlight_Parade" title="Footlight Parade">Footlight Parade</a>
				</i>, which gave Cagney the chance to return to his song-and-dance roots, and was
				Warners first real attempt at the musical genre. It was thought of as one of
				Cagney's best early films, featuring particular show-stopping scenes in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busby_Berkeley" title="Busby Berkeley">Busby Berkeley</a> choreographed routines. His next
				notable film was 1934's <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Comes_the_Navy" title="Here Comes the Navy">Here Comes the Navy</a>
				</i> which saw him pair up with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_O%27Brien_(actor)" title="Pat O'Brien (actor)">Pat O'Brien</a> for the first time, which would lead
				them to a long friendship.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1935 was a critical year for Cagney. He was
				listed as one of the 'Top Ten Moneymakers in Hollywood' for the first time. He was
				cast more frequently outside of gangster roles; in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Men" title="G-Men">G-Men</a>
				</i> he played a lawyer who joined the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI" title="FBI">FBI</a>, and he also took on
				his first, and only, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare" title="Shakespeare">Shakespearean</a> role, as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bottom" title="Nick Bottom">Nick

				</i>, which featured <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Rooney" title="Mickey Rooney">Mickey
					Rooney</a> as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puck_(Shakespeare)" title="Puck (Shakespeare)">Puck</a>, though it was not critically well
				received.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney's last 1935 movie was <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceiling_Zero" title="Ceiling Zero">Ceiling Zero</a>
				</i> and his third with Pat O'Brien. Significantly though, O'Brien received top
				billing, above Cagney in what was a clear breach of his (Cagney's) contract. This,
				combined with the fact that he had made five movies in 1934, again against his
				contract terms, was too much for Cagney, and he brought legal proceedings against
				Warners for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract" title="Breach of contract">breach of contract</a>. The dispute dragged on for
				several months. Cagney received calls from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Selznick" title="David O. Selznick">David Selznick</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Goldwyn" title="Sam Goldwyn">Sam
					Goldwyn</a>, but neither felt in a position to offer him work while the dispute
				went on.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the legal dispute rumbled on, with
				Cagney's brother Bill representing James in court, James and Billie went back to New
				York and looked for a country property where he could indulge in his passion for
				farming.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney spent most of the next year on his farm,
				and only went back to work when Edward L. Alperson from the new, independent Grand
				National films approached him to make movies at $100,000 a film and 10% of the
				profits. Cagney made two films, <i>Great Guy</i> and <i>Something to Sing About</i>.
				Cagney received good reviews for both, but overall the production quality was not up
				to Warner standards and the films did not do especially well. A third film was
				planned (<i>Dynamite</i>) but Grand National ran out of money.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The timing was fortunate for Cagney, as the
				courts decided the Warners lawsuit in Cagney's favor. He had done what many would
				have thought unthinkable; taken on the studios and won. Not only did he win the
				suit, but Warners knew that he was still a huge star, and invited him back in a
				5-year, $150,000 a film deal, with no more than 2 films a year and with Cagney
				having full say over what films he did and didn't make. William Cagney was also
				guaranteed a deal in an assistant producer for the films James would star in.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney had established the power of the walkout
				as keeping the studios to their word:</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney himself acknowledged the importance of
				the walkout for other actors in breaking the dominance of the studio system.
				Normally when stars walked out, the time they were absent was added on to the end of
				their already long contract, as happened with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_de_Havilland" title="Olivia de Havilland">Olivia de Havilland</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bette_Davis" title="Bette Davis">Bette
					Davis</a>. Cagney could walk out and came back with an improved contract.
				Unsurprisingly, the whole of Hollywood watched the case closely for hints of how
				future contracts might be handled..</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Artistically, the Grand National experiment was
				a success for Cagney, who was able to move away from his traditional Warners tough
				guy roles to more sympathetic characters. How far he could have experimented and
				developed can never be known, but certainly back in the Warners fold he was back
				playing tough guys.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney's two films of 1938 both co-starred Pat
				O'Brien, <i>Boy Meets Girl</i> and <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_with_Dirty_Faces" title="Angels with Dirty Faces">Angels with Dirty Faces</a>
				</i>. The former saw Cagney in a comedy role that received mixed reviews. Warners
				had allowed Cagney his change of pace, but they were keen to get him back to doing
				what made them money, namely playing tough guys. Ironically, the script for
					<i>Angels</i> was one that Cagney had hoped to do while with Grand National, but
				the studio had been unable to secure funding.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney starred as Rocky Sullivan, a gangster
				fresh out of jail looking for his former associate (played by supporting player <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart" title="Humphrey Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a>, their first film together) who owes
				him money. Whilst revisiting his old haunts he runs into his old friend Jerry
				Connolly who is now a priest looking after the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_End_Kids" title="Dead End Kids">Dead End
					Kids</a>. The kids idolize Rocky, much to Connolly's concern. After a messy
				shoot-out, Sullivan is eventually captured by the police and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment" title="Capital punishment">sentenced to death</a> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_chair" title="Electric chair">electric chair</a>. Connolly pleads with Rocky to 'turn yellow' on his way to
				the chair so that the Kids lose their respect for him, and hopefully avoid a life of
				crime. Sullivan refuses, but on his way to the chair does beg for his life. The film
				is ambiguous in whether this cowardice was for real or just for the Kids' benefit.
				Cagney himself refused to say, insisting he liked the ambiguity and the audience
				making its own mind up. The film is regarded by many as one of Cagney's finest and
				garnered him an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a> nomination
				for 1938 (losing out to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer
					Tracy</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_Town_(film)" title="Boys Town (film)">Boys Town</a>,</i> a role which, ironically Cagney
				had been considered for, but lost out on due to his tough guy image.), but winning

					Circle Award for Best Actor</a></p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney's earlier insistence on not filming with
				live ammunition came to good during the filming of <i>Angels with Dirty Faces</i>.
				Having been told he would film a scene with real machine gun bullets, Cagney
				refused, and insisted the shots be superimposed afterwards. As it turned out, he was
				right, a ricocheting bullet passing through exactly where his head would have been.
				Cagney's first year back at Warners saw him becoming the studio's highest earner,
				earning $324,000.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney completed his first decade of
				movie-making in 1939, with <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Roaring_Twenties" title="The Roaring Twenties">The Roaring Twenties</a>
				</i>, his first film with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Walsh" title="Raoul Walsh">Raoul
					Walsh</a> and last with Bogart. It was, perhaps more surprisingly, his last
				'gangster' film for ten years. Cagney again got good reviews, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Greene" title="Graham Greene">Graham
					Greene</a> stating "Mr Cagney, of the bull-calf brow, is as always a superb and
				witty actor". <i>The Roaring Twenties</i> was also the last film where violence was
				explained as part of a poor upbringing or the environment around the character, as
				in <i>The Public Enemy</i>. From this point on, violence was attached to mania, as
				in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Heat" title="White Heat">White Heat</a>
				</i>. 1939 also saw him second only to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary
					Cooper</a> in the national wage stakes, earning $368,333.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His next notable career role was playing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Cohan" title="George M. Cohan">George M. Cohan</a> in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Doodle_Dandy" title="Yankee Doodle Dandy">Yankee Doodle Dandy</a>

			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Wallis" title="Hal Wallis">Hal Wallis</a>
				said that having seen Cohan in <i>I'd Rather Be Right</i>, he never considered
				anyone other than Cagney for the role. Cagney himself, on the other hand, insists
				that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Astaire" title="Fred Astaire">Fred Astaire</a> had been the first choice and turned it
				down.</p>

				worked in a "patriotic frenzy" as the US's early involvement in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War

			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cohan himself had a private showing, shortly
				before his death, and thanked Cagney "for a wonderful job". A paid for premiere with
				seats ranging from $25 to $25,000, raised $5,750,000 in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_bond" title="War bond">war bonds</a> for
				the US treasury.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many critics of the time and since have declared
				it to be Cagney's best film, and draw parallels between Cohan and Cagney; a career
				begun in vaudeville, years of struggle before reaching the peak of their profession,
				the surrounding with family (during his career, brothers Bill and Ed and sister
				Jeanne worked for Cagney Productions), early marriage, and a wife who was happy to
				sit back while he went on to stardom.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Certainly it was Cagney's most important film in
				terms of awards, winning him the Best Actor Oscar (amongst three others Oscars for
				the film and eight nominations). In his acceptance speech, Cagney said</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coming on the back of his biggest success, and
				particularly because it didn't come from a gangster movie, Cagney felt that it was
				time, once again, to leave Warners. He had lost out on <i>Boys' Town</i> to Tracy,
				and also lost the role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame" title="University of Notre Dame">Notre Dame</a> football coach <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knute_Rockne" title="Knute Rockne">Knute Rockne</a> in <i>

				that Warners had developed for him.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Having won his Oscar just as his Warners
				contract was due for renewal, he could have asked for whatever he wanted and they
				would have given it to him, but Cagney was determined to be his own man, and so
				announced in March 1942 that he and brother Bill were setting up 'Cagney
				Productions' to release films though <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Artists" title="United Artists">United
					Artists</a>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Free of Warners again, Cagney spent some time
				relaxing on his farm in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha%27s_Vineyard" title="Martha's Vineyard">Martha's Vineyard</a>, before volunteering to join the
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USO" title="USO">USO</a>
				and spending several weeks touring the US entertaining troops with vaudeville

				elected president of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild" title="Screen Actors Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Almost a year after announcing the creation of
				his new production company, in March 1943 Cagney's new company produced its first
				film, <i>Johnny Come Lately</i>. While the main studios were producing patriotic war
				movies, Cagney was determined to stick to his own path and to continue to try and
				shake off his tough guy image and produced a movie that was a "complete and
				exhilarating exposition of the Cagney "alter-ego" on film". According to Cagney, the
				film "made money but it was no great winner", and criticism of it varied from
				excellent in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a>
				</i> to the poor from New York's <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM_(newspaper)" title="PM (newspaper)">PM</a>
				</i>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the completion of the film, Cagney
				went back to the USO and toured US military bases in the UK. He refused to do any
				interviews with the UK press, preferring to concentrate on rehearsals and
				performances, giving several shows a day for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Signal_Corps" title="Army Signal Corps">Army Signal Corps</a>. The show, called <i>The American Cavalcade of Dance</i>
				consisted of a history of American dance, from the earliest days through to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Astaire" title="Fred Astaire">Fred Astaire</a>, and culminating with dances from
					<i>Yankee Doodle Dandy</i>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The second movie Cagney's company would produce
				was <i>Blood On the Sun</i>, a film for which Cagney, insisting on doing his own
				stunts, required <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo" title="Judo">judo</a> training from Ken Kuniyuki, a judo expert, and Jack
				Halloran, a former policeman. The Cagneys had hoped that a more action based James
				Cagney film would appeal more to the audience, but the film fared worse at the box
				office than <i>Johnny Come Lately</i>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At this time, Cagney heard of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audie_Murphy" title="Audie Murphy">Audie Murphy</a>, a young war hero who appeared on the
				front of <i>Life</i> magazine. Cagney thought that he had the looks to be a success
				in movies, and suggested that he come to Hollywood for a try-out, but Murphy could
				not act, and his contract was loaned out then sold on.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While negotiating the rights for their third
				independent film, Cagney took up an offer from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a> to star in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_Rue_Madeleine" title="13 Rue Madeleine">13 Rue Madeleine</a>
				</i> at $300,000 for two months work. The film was a success, and Cagney was keen to
				pick up production of his new project, an adaptation of a Broadway play, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Saroyan" title="William Saroyan">William Saroyan</a>'s <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_of_Your_Life" title="The Time of Your Life">The Time of Your Life</a>
				</i>. Saroyan himself loved the film but it was a commercial disaster, costing the
				company half a million dollars, with audiences again struggling to accept Cagney out
				of tough guy roles.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney Productions was in serious trouble; poor
				returns from the produced films and a legal dispute with Sam Goldwyn Studio over a
				rental agreement all forced Cagney back to Warners. Cagney signed a
				distribution-production deal with Warners for the film <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Heat" title="White Heat">White Heat</a>
				</i>, effectively Cagney Productions became a unit of Warner Brothers.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney's portrayal of Cody Jarrett in the 1949
				film <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Heat" title="White Heat">White Heat</a>
				</i> is one of his most memorable. Cinema had changed in the ten years since Walsh
				had last directed Cagney (in <i>The Roaring Twenties</i>), and Cagney's portrayal of
				gangsters changed too. Unlike Tom Powers in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Public_Enemy" title="The Public Enemy">The Public Enemy</a>
				</i>, Jarrett has little or no sympathetic characteristics. In the 18 intervening
				years, Cagney had started to grey and developed a paunch for the first time. He was
				no longer a romantic commodity, and this was reflected in his portrayal of Jarrett.
				Cagney himself had the idea of playing Jarrett as a psychotic:</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film has a number of memorable scenes and
				lines. Cagney's closing lines of the film "Made it, Ma! Top of the world!" before
				exploding in a huge fireball was voted the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years..._100_Movie_Quotes" title="AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes">18<sup>th</sup> greatest movie

				of rage in prison on being told of Jarrett's mother's death is one of his most
				memorable and extraordinary performances.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Such was the violence that he gave the
				performance some of the extras on the set were terrified of destruction that Cagney
				wrought. Cagney attributed the performance to his father's alcohol induced rages
				that he had seen as a child, as well as someone that he had seen on a visit to a
				mental hospital.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was a critical success, though some
				critics wondered about the social impact of a character that they at least saw as
				sympathetic. Cagney though was still struggling against the gangster typecasting,
				saying to a journalist "It's what the people want me to do. Some day, though, I'd
				like to make another movie that kids could go and see"</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, Warners, perhaps searching for another
					<i>Yankee Doodle Dandy</i> gave Cagney a musical for his next picture, the 1950 <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Point_Story_(film)" title="The West Point Story (film)">The West Point Story</a>
				</i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Day" title="Doris Day">Doris Day</a>, an actress he admired.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following film was another gangster movie,
					<i>Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye</i>, which was Cagney Productions first movie for
				Warners since returning. While it was compared, unfavourably to <i>White Heat</i> by
				critics, it was fairly successful at the box office, with $500,000 going straight to
				Cagney Productions' bankers to pay off their losses.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney Productions was not a great success
				however, and in 1953, the company ended and William Cagney produced his last film, <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_Lion_Is_In_The_Streets&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="A Lion Is In The Streets (page does not exist)">A Lion Is In The
						Streets</a>
				</i>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney's next most notable role was the 1955
				film <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Me_or_Leave_Me_(film)" title="Love Me or Leave Me (film)">Love Me or Leave Me</a>
				</i>, and his third with Day. Cagney played <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Snyder" title="Martin Snyder">Martin
					"Moe the Gimp" Snyder</a>, a lame <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish-American" title="Jewish-American">Jewish-American</a> gangster from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, a role
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a> turned down. Cagney described the script
				as "that extremely rare thing, the perfect script". When the film was released,
				Snyder reportedly asked how Cagney had so accurately copied his limp, but Cagney
				himself insisted he hadn't, he had made it up based on personal observation of other
				people when they limped "What I did was very simple. I just slapped my foot down as
				I turned it out while walking. That's all".</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His performance earned him another Best Actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nomination, 17 years after his first.
				Reviews were strong, and the film is considered to be one of his best of his later
				career, and in Day he had found a co-star he could build a rapport with such as he
				had had with Blondell at the start of his career, and Day herself was full of praise
				for Cagney</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney's next film was <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Roberts_(1955_film)" title="Mister Roberts (1955 film)">Mister Roberts</a>
				</i>, directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" title="John Ford">John Ford</a> and slated to star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer
					Tracy</a>. It was Tracy's involvement that ensured that Cagney accepted the
				minor role, though in the end Tracy didn't take part and was replaced by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>. Cagney had worked with Ford before on
					<i>What Price Glory?</i>, and had got on fairly well. However, as soon as Ford
				met Cagney at the airport, he (Ford) warned that they would "tangle asses", which
				caught Cagney by surprise.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The next day, Cagney was slightly late on set,
				and Ford was fuming. Cagney cut short the imminent tirade, saying "When I started
				this picture, you said that we would tangle asses before this was over. I'm ready
				now - are you?" Ford walked away and he and Cagney had no more problems, even if he
				never particularly liked Ford.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney's skill at noticing tiny details in other
				actor's performances re-appeared during the shooting of <i>Mister Roberts</i>. When
				watching the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Music_Hall_(TV_series)" title="Kraft Music Hall (TV series)">Kraft Music Hall</a> anthology television
				show some months before, Cagney had noticed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Lemmon" title="Jack Lemmon">Jack
					Lemmon</a> performing left-handed. The first thing that Cagney asked Lemmon when
				they met to film was if he was still using his left hand. Lemmon was shocked, he had
				done it on a whim, hadn't told anyone and thought no-one else had noticed.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was a success, securing three Oscar
				nominations, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Best Picture</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Sound" title="Academy Award for Sound">Best Sound Recording</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor">Best Supporting Actor</a> for
				Lemmon, who won. Whilst Cagney wasn't nominated, he had thoroughly enjoyed the
				production. Filming on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Island" title="Midway Island">Midway
					Island</a> and in a more minor role meant that he had time to relax and engage
				in his hobby of painting and also of drawing caricatures of the cast and crew.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney worked with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM" title="MGM">MGM</a> on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_film" title="Western film">Western film</a>
				<i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribute_to_a_Bad_Man" title="Tribute to a Bad Man">Tribute to a Bad Man</a>
				</i>, a role that had originally be written for Spencer Tracy. Cagney received
				praise for his performance, and the studio liked his work enough to offer him
					<i>These Wilder Years</i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Stanwyck" title="Barbara Stanwyck">Barbara Stanwyck</a>. Cagney and Stanwyck got on well, both had worked in
				vaudeville, and they entertained the cast and crew off-screen by singing and
				dancing.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1956, Cagney undertook one of his very rare
				television roles, starring in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Montgomery_(actor)" title="Robert Montgomery (actor)">Robert Montgomery</a>'s <i>Soldiers From the
					War Returning</i>, as a favour to Montgomery who needed a strong fall season
				opener to stop the network dropping his series. Cagney's appearance ensured that it
				was a success. He made it clear to reporters afterwards that television was not his
				medium "I do enough work in movies. This is a high-tension business. I have
				tremendous admiration for the people who go through this sort of thing every week,
				but it's not for me."</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney's most significant film of 1956 was <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_a_Thousand_Faces" title="Man of a Thousand Faces">Man of a Thousand Faces</a>
				</i>, in which he played <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lon_Chaney" title="Lon Chaney">Lon
				Chaney</a>, a role which he received excellent reviews, with the <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Journal_American" title="New York Journal American">New York Journal American</a>
				</i> rating it one of his best performances, and the film, made for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Pictures" title="Universal Pictures">Universal</a> taking big money. Again, Cagney's
				skills of mimicry, combined with a physical similarity to Chaney, allowed him to
				generate empathy for his character. It was the last time that Cagney would star on
				film with his sister Jeanne.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1957, Cagney ventured behind the camera for
				the first, and only, time to direct <i>Short Cut to Hell</i>, a remake of the 1941
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Ladd" title="Alan Ladd">Alan Ladd</a> film <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Gun_for_Hire" title="This Gun for Hire">This Gun for Hire</a>

					Greene</a> novel <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Gun_for_Sale" title="A Gun for Sale">A Gun for Sale</a>
				</i>. Cagney had long been told by friends that he would be an excellent director,
				so when he was approached by his friend producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._C._Lyles" title="A. C. Lyles">A. C.
					Lyles</a>, he instinctively said yes. He refused all offers of payment, saying
				his was an actor, not a director. The film was low budget, and shot quickly, as
				Cagney recalled: "We shot it in twenty days, and that was long enough for me. I find
				directing a bore, I have no desire to tell other people their business".</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney's next film was over a year later, in
				1959, when he travelled to Ireland to film <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_Hands_with_the_Devil_(1959_film)" title="Shake Hands with the Devil (1959 film)">Shake Hands with the
						Devil</a>
				</i>, directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Anderson_(director)" title="Michael Anderson (director)">Michael Anderson</a>. While in Ireland,
				Cagney had hoped to spend some time tracing his ancestry, but time constraints and
				poor weather meant that he was unable to fulfil this wish. It was the over-riding
				message of the film, the violence inevitably leads to violence, that attracted
				Cagney, who played an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army" title="Irish Republican Army">Irish Republican Army</a> commander, and resulted
				in him producing what some critics would regard as his finest of his final
				years.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney's career was now winding down, and he
				made only one film in 1960, the critically acclaimed <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gallant_Hours" title="The Gallant Hours">The Gallant Hours</a>
				</i> in which he played <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Halsey" title="William F. Halsey">Admiral William F. "Bull" Halsey</a>. The film, whilst set during the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalcanal_Campaign" title="Guadalcanal Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a> in the Pacific Ocean
				during World War II, was not a war film but instead focused on the effect of
				command. The film saw the return, in name only, of Cagney Productions, which shared
				the production credit with Robert Montgomery's company, who also directed it. The
				film was a success, and <i>The New York Times'</i> Bosley Crowther singled its star
				out for praise: "It is Mr. Cagney's performance, controlled to the last detail, that
				gives life and strong, heroic stature to the principal figure in the film. There is
				no braggadocio in it, no straining for bold or sharp effects. It is one of the
				quietest, most reflective, subtlest jobs that Mr Cagney has ever done."</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney's final film, at least for 20 years,
				would be a comedy. He was hand-picked by the film's director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Wilder" title="Billy Wilder">Billy
					Wilder</a> to play a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola" title="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>
				executive in the film <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One,_Two,_Three" title="One, Two, Three">One, Two, Three</a>
				</i>. Cagney had concerns with the script, remembering back 23 years to <i>Boy Meets
					Girl</i> where scenes were re-shot to make them funnier by making them faster
				with the opposite effect. Cagney received assurances from Wilder that the script was
				balanced. Filming did not go well, though, with one scene requiring 50 takes,
				something Cagney was totally unused to. In fact, the filming was one of the worst
				experiences of Cagney's long career. One of the only positives to come out of it for
				Cagney was his friendship with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Tiffin" title="Pamela Tiffin">Pamela
					Tiffin</a>, to whom he gave acting guidance, imparting the secret that he'd
				learned over his career: "You walk in, plant yourself squarely on both feet, look
				the other fella in the eye, and tell the truth."</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the filming of <i>One, Two, Three</i>,
				for the first time in his career, Cagney considering walking out of a film before
				completion; he felt he had had too many years working inside studios, and combined
				with a visit to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dachau_concentration_camp" title="Dachau concentration camp">Dachau concentration camp</a> during filming,
				he decided that he'd had enough, and retired.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney remained in retirement for twenty years,
				conjuring up images of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Warner" title="Jack Warner">Jack
					Warner</a> every time he was tempted to return which soon dispelled the notion.
				After he had turned down the offer to play Alfred Doolite in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Fair_Lady_(film)" title="My Fair Lady (film)">My Fair Lady</a>, he found it far easier to rebuff
				others, including a part in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_II" title="The Godfather Part II">The Godfather Part II</a>. He made a few public
				appearances, preferring to spend the winters in Los Angeles, and the summers either
				in his Martha's Vineyard farm, or at Verney Farms in New York. When in New York, he
				and Billie held numerous parties at the Silver Horn restaurant, where they got to
				know Marge Zimmermann, the proprietress.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney had been diagnosed with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma" title="Glaucoma">glaucoma</a> and was taking eye-drops, but continued to have problems with his
				vision. On Zimmerman's recommendation, he visited a different doctor, who identified
				that the glaucoma was a misdiagnosis, and that Cagney was actually <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes" title="Diabetes">diabetic</a>. Zimmerman then took it upon herself to look after Cagney,
				preparing his meals to reduce his blood <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride" title="Triglyceride">triglyceride</a> level which had reached alarming proportions. Such was her
				success, that by the time Cagney made a rare public appearance at his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI" title="AFI">AFI</a>
				Lifetime Achievement award ceremony in 1974 he had lost 20 pounds and his vision had

				— said to be more than for any event in history — that one columnist wrote at the
				time that a bomb in the dining room would have brought about the end of the movie

				'MMMMmmmm, you dirty rat!' What I actually said was 'Judy, Judy, Judy!" which was

				hospital, Zimmerman became his full-time carer, travelling with Jimmy and Billie
				wherever they went. After the stroke, Cagney was no longer able to undertake many of
				his favourite pastimes, horseriding and dancing, and as he became more depressed, he
				even gave up his most beloved hobby of all, painting. Cagney's doctor realised that
				his client was getting more and more depressed, and so encouraged by his wife Billie
				and Zimmerman, Cagney took up the offer from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo%C5%A1_Forman" title="Miloš Forman">Miloš

			<wiki:personal>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On September 28, 1922, Cagney married dancer
					Frances Willard "Billie" Vernon with whom he remained for the rest of his life.
					They met on the chorus line of <i>Pitter Patter</i>. They adopted a son, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cagney_Jr" title="James Cagney Jr">James Cagney Jr</a> (Jim) in 1941, and had a
					daughter, Cathleen "Casey" Cagney. Cagney was a very private man, and whilst he
					was more than willing to give the press photographs when necessary, he generally
					spent his private time out of the public eye. </p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a young man, Cagney had always been
					interested in farming - an interest sparked by an soil conservation lecture he
					attended - and during his first walkout from Warners found a 100 acre farm in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha%27s_Vineyard" title="Martha's Vineyard">Martha's Vineyard</a>; owning a farm had long been
					a dream of his. Cagney loved the fact that there were no concrete roads
					surrounding the property, only dirt-tracks. The house itself was rather run-down
					and ramshackle, Billie was initially reluctant to move in, but soon came to love
					the place as well. After getting inundated by movie fans, Cagney sent out a
					rumour that he had hired a gunman as security. This ruse proved so successful
					that when <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a> came to visit, his taxi driver
					refused to drive up to the house saying "I hear they shoot!", forcing Tracy to
					walk.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1955, having shot three films on the
					trot, Cagney bought a 120 acre farm in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutchess_County" title="Dutchess County">Dutchess County</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford,_New_York" title="Stanford, New York">Stanfordville, New York</a>, for $100,000. Cagney
					named the farm <i>Verney Farm</i>, taking the first syllable from Billie's
					maiden name, and the second from his own surname. Cagney didn't just live on the
					farm, but turned it back into a working farm, selling some of the existing diary
					cattle and replacing them with beef cattle. He expanded the farm over the years
					to a 750 acre site. Such was Cagney's enthusiasm for farming, that when he was
					awarded an honorary degree from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollins_College" title="Rollins College">Rollins College</a>, he surprised the staff by writing a paper on soil
					conservation, rather than just "turning up with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ava_Gardner" title="Ava Gardner">Ava

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since a little boy sitting on the horses of
					the local delivery riders and riding horse-drawn streetcars with his mother, he
					had loved horses. He raised horses on his farms, off and on, specialising in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_horse" title="Morgan horse">Morgans</a>, a breed of which he was particularly
					fond.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney was also a keen sailor, owning boats
					on both the Eastern and Western coasts of the USA , though he did suffer from
					seasickness on random occasions, sometimes not suffering in a heavy sea, but
					then being ill on a calm day.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cagney was also a keen painter, his most
					favorite of hobbies and claimed in his autobiography that he may well have been
					happier as a painter than a movie star, if somewhat poorer. One of his teachers
					in later life was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bongart" title="Sergei Bongart">Sergei Bongart</a>, who went on to own two of Cagney's paintings. Cagney

			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In his autobiography, Cagney states that as a
				young man he had no political views, he was simply more concerned with where the
				next meal was coming from. Fanzines in the 1930s however, described his politics as

					robbed a railroad car as kids. Rocky saved Jerry's life during the chase by
					pulling him out of the way of a steam train. Rocky was then caught by the
					police, but Jerry - who could run faster - escaped. Rocky, after being sent to
					reform school, grows up to become a notorious gangster, while Jerry has become a
					priest.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rocky returns to his old neighborhood, where
					Jerry is running a home that intends to keep young boys away from a life of
					crime. Six of those boys, Soapy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Halop" title="Billy Halop">Billy

					friend from corrupting them.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meanwhile Rocky gets involved with Frazier
						(<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart" title="Humphrey Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a>), a crooked lawyer, and Keefer
						(<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bancroft_(actor)" title="George Bancroft (actor)">George Bancroft</a>), a shady businessman
					and municipal contractor. They try to dispose of Rocky, but he finds the record
					book that they keep where they list the bribes to city officials. Jerry learns
					of these events and warns Rocky to leave before he informs the authorities.
					Rocky ignores his advice and Jerry gets the public's attention and informs them
					all of the crooked government, causing Frazier and Keefer to plot to kill him.
					Rocky overhears this plot and kills them to protect his childhood friend.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rocky is then captured following an
					elaborate shootout in a building, and sentenced to die. Jerry visits him just
					before his execution and asks him to do him one last favor - to die pretending
					to be a screaming, snivelling coward, which would end the boys' idolization of
					him. Rocky refuses, and insists he will be "tough" to the end, and not give up
					the one thing he has left, his pride. At the very last moment he appears to
					change his mind and has to be dragged to the electric chair. The viewer is never
					told whether Rocky genuinely was afraid, a "rotten sniveling coward," or if he
					does it for the Father and the boys. The boys hear about what happened and
					decide he was a coward. Then Father Jerry asks them to say a prayer with him,
					"for a boy who couldn't run as fast as I could."</p>

				however, was enthusiastic about the chance to play Rocky. He saw it as a suitable
				vehicle to prove to critics and front office honchos that he had a broad acting
