Her parents were "jobbing actors", which led Winslet to comment that she "didn't have a privileged upbringing" and that their daily life was "very hand to mouth". Her maternal grandparents, Linda (nÃ©e Plumb) and Archibald Oliver Bridges, founded and operated the Reading Repertory Theatre, and her uncle, Robert Bridges, appeared in the original <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London" title="West End of London">West End</a> production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver!" title="Oliver!">Oliver!</a></i>.

Speaking about her experience on a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_set" title="Film set">film set</a> as an absolute beginner, Winslet noted: "With <i>Heavenly Creatures</i>, all I knew I had to do was completely become that person. In a way it was quite nice doing [the film] and not knowing a bloody thing."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following year, Winslet auditioned for the small but pivotal role of Lucy Steele in the adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen" title="Jane Austen">Jane Austen</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_Sensibility_(film)" title="Sense and Sensibility (film)">Sense and Sensibility</a></i>, featuring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Thompson" title="Emma Thompson">Emma Thompson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant" title="Hugh Grant">Hugh Grant</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Rickman" title="Alan Rickman">Alan Rickman</a>.

Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ang_Lee" title="Ang Lee">Ang Lee</a> admitted he was initially worried about the way Winslet had attacked her role in <i>Heavenly Creatures</i> and thus required her to exercise <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi_chuan" title="Tai chi chuan">tai chi</a>, read Austen-era <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_novels" title="Gothic novels">Gothic novels</a> and poetry, and work with a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano" title="Piano">piano</a> teacher to fit the grace of the role. Budgeted at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US$" title="US$">US$</a>16.5 million ($23.6 million in current year dollars) the film became a financial and critical success, resulting in a worldwide box office total of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US$" title="US$">US$</a>135 million ($192.7 million) and various awards for Winslet, winning her both a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts" title="British Academy of Film and Television Arts">BAFTA</a> and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild_Awards" title="Screen Actors Guild Awards">Screen Actors Guild Award</a>, and nominations for both an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award" title="Golden Globe Award">Golden Globe</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1996, Winslet starred in both <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_(film)" title="Jude (film)">Jude</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_(1996_film)" title="Hamlet (1996 film)">Hamlet</a></i>. In <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Winterbottom" title="Michael Winterbottom">Michael Winterbottom</a>'s <i>Jude</i>, based on the Victorian novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_the_Obscure" title="Jude the Obscure">Jude the Obscure</a></i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy" title="Thomas Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a>, she played Sue Bridehead, a young woman with suffragette leanings who falls in love with her cousin, played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Eccleston" title="Christopher Eccleston">Christopher Eccleston</a>. Acclaimed among critics, it was not a success at the box office, barely grossing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US$" title="US$">US$</a>2 million ($2.8 million) worldwide. Richard Corliss of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)"><i>Time</i> magazine</a> said "Winslet is worthy of [...] the camera's scrupulous adoration. She's perfect, a modernist ahead of her time [...] and <i>Jude</i> is a handsome showcase for her gifts." Winslet played <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophelia_(character)" title="Ophelia (character)">Ophelia</a>, Hamlet's drowned lover, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Branagh" title="Kenneth Branagh">Kenneth Branagh</a>'s all star-cast <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_on_screen" title="Shakespeare on screen">film version</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a></i>. The film garnered largely positive reviews and earned Winslet her second <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_Empire_Awards" title="Sony Ericsson Empire Awards">Empire Award</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In mid-1996, Winslet began filming <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron" title="James Cameron">James Cameron</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)" title="Titanic (1997 film)">Titanic</a></i> (1997), alongside <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio" title="Leonardo DiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>.

"<i>Titanic</i> was totally different and nothing could have prepared me for it. ... We were really scared about the whole adventure. ... Jim [Cameron] is a perfectionist, a real genius at making movies. But there was all this bad press before it came out, and that was really upsetting." Against expectations, the film went on to become the highest-grossing film of all time, grossing more than <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">US$</a>1.843 billion ($2.6 billion) in box-office receipts worldwide, and transformed Winslet into a commercial movie star.

Winslet had rejected offers to play the leading roles in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_in_Love" title="Shakespeare in Love">Shakespeare in Love</a></i> (1998) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_and_the_King" title="Anna and the King">Anna and the King</a></i> (1999) in favour of the role of a young English mother named Julia who moves with her daughters from London to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> hoping to start a new life. The film garnered generally mixed reviews and received only limited distribution, resulting in a worldwide gross of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US$" title="US$">US$</a>5 million ($6.5 million). Despite the success of <i>Titanic</i>, the next film Winslet opted to star in was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Smoke!" title="Holy Smoke!">Holy Smoke!</a></i> (1999), featuring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Keitel" title="Harvey Keitel">Harvey Keitel</a>, another low-budget projectâ€”much to the chagrin of her agents, who felt "miserable" about her preference of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_film" title="Art film">arthouse</a> movies. Feeling pressured, Winslet has said she "never saw <i>Titanic</i> as a springboard for bigger films or bigger pay cheques", knowing that "it could have been that, but would have destroyed [her]."

Hanna is one of the defendants.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The key evidence is the testimony of Ilana Mather (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Maria_Lara" title="Alexandra Maria Lara">Alexandra Maria Lara</a>), author of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir" title="Memoir">memoir</a> of how she and her mother, who also testifies, survived. Hanna, unlike her co-defendants, admits that Auschwitz was an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extermination_camp" title="Extermination camp">extermination camp</a> and that the ten women she chose during each month's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Nazi_Germany#S" title="Glossary of Nazi Germany">Selektion</a></i> were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chamber#Nazi_Germany" title="Gas chamber">gassed</a>. She denies authorship of a report on the church fire, despite pressure from the other defendants, but then admits it rather than complying with a demand to provide a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penmanship" title="Penmanship">handwriting</a> sample.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Michael then realizes Hanna's secret: she is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_illiteracy" title="Functional illiteracy">illiterate</a> and has concealed it her whole life. The other female guards who claim she wrote the report are lying to place responsibility on Hanna. Michael informs Rohl that he has information favorable to one of the defendants but is not sure what to do since the defendant herself chooses not to disclose the information. Rohl tells him that if he has learned nothing from the past there is no point in having the seminar.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hanna receives a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment" title="Life imprisonment">life sentence</a> for her admitted leadership role in the church deaths while the other defendants are sentenced to four years and three months each. Michael meanwhile marries, has a daughter and divorces. Retrieving his books from the time of the affair with Hanna, he begins reading them into a tape recorder. He sends the cassette tapes and a recorder to Hanna. Eventually, she begins to check the books out from the prison library and teaches herself to read and write by following along with Michael's tapes. She starts writing back to Michael in brief, child-like notes.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Michael does not write back or visit, but keeps sending tapes, and in 1988 a prison official (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Bassett" title="Linda Bassett">Linda Bassett</a>) telephones him to seek his help with Hanna's transition into society after her upcoming release. He finds a place for her to live and a job and finally visits Hanna a week before her release. In their meeting, Michael remains somewhat distant and confronts her about what she has learned from her past. Michael arrives at the prison on the date of Hanna's release with flowers. He discovers that Hanna <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging#As_suicide" title="Hanging">hanged herself</a> and left a tea tin with cash in it with a note asking Michael to give the cash and some money in a bank account to Ilana.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Michael travels to New York. He meets Ilana (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lena_Olin" title="Lena Olin">Lena Olin</a>) and confesses his relationship with Hanna. He tells her about the suicide note and Hanna's illiteracy. Ilana tells Michael there is nothing to be learned from the camps. Michael suggests that she donate the money to an organization that combats adult illiteracy, preferably a Jewish one, and she agrees, though she wryly notes "illiteracy isn't much of a Jewish problem." Ilana keeps the tea tin since it is similar to one stolen from her in Auschwitz.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In April 1998, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramax_Films" title="Miramax Films">Miramax Films</a> acquired the rights to the novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reader" title="The Reader">The Reader</a></i>, and principal photography began in September 2007 immediately after <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Daldry" title="Stephen Daldry">Stephen Daldry</a> was signed to direct the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation" title="Film adaptation">film adaptation</a> and actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Fiennes" title="Ralph Fiennes">Ralph Fiennes</a> was cast into a lead role. Kate Winslet was originally cast as Hanna, but scheduling difficulties with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Road_(film)" title="Revolutionary Road (film)">Revolutionary Road</a> led her to leave the film and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Kidman" title="Nicole Kidman">Nicole Kidman</a> was cast as her replacement. In January 2008, Kidman left the project, citing her recent pregnancy as the primary reason. She had not filmed any scenes yet, so the studio was able to recast Winslet without affecting the production schedule.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filming took place in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6rlitz" title="GÃ¶rlitz">GÃ¶rlitz</a> and was finished in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne" title="Cologne">Cologne</a> on July 14. Filmmakers received $718,752 from Germany's Federal Film Board. Overall, the studio received $4.1 million from Germany's regional and federal subsidiaries.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Schlink insisted the film be shot in English rather than German, as it posed questions about living in a post-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide" title="Genocide">genocide</a> society that went beyond mid-century Germany. Daldry and Hare toured locations from the novel with Schlink, viewed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film" title="Documentary film">documentaries</a> about <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Germany_since_1945" title="History of Germany since 1945">that period in German history</a> and read books and articles about women who had served as SS guards in the camps. Hare, who rejected using a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceover" title="Voiceover">voiceover</a> narration to render the long <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_monologue" title="Internal monologue">internal monologues</a> in the novel, also changed the ending so that Michael starts to tell the story of Hanna and him to his daughter. "It's about literature as a powerful means of communication, and at other times as a substitute for communication", he explained.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The primary cast, all of whom were German besides Fiennes, Olin and Winslet, decided to emulate Kross's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accent_(sociolinguistics)" title="Accent (sociolinguistics)">accent</a> since he had just learned English for the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Menges" title="Chris Menges">Chris Menges</a> replaced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Deakins" title="Roger Deakins">Roger Deakins</a> as cinematographer.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the film's producers, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Rudin" title="Scott Rudin">Scott Rudin</a>, left the production over a dispute about the release date and has had his name removed from the credit list. Rudin differed with Harvey Weinstein "because he didn't want to campaign for an Oscar along with <i>Doubt</i> and <i>Revolutionary Road</i>, which also stars Winslet." Winslet won best actress for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> for <i>The Reader</i>, the film for which she has been awarded a Golden Globe as best supporting actress. Marc Caro writes, "Because Winslet couldn't get best actress nominations for both movies, the Weinstein Co. shifted her to supporting actress for <i>The Reader</i> as a courtesy."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sex scenes were shot last after Kross had turned 18.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Critical reception for the film was positive to mixed, having a 61 percent rating on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> wrote that the film was well-realized and dramatic, but that it came across as "an essentially cerebral experience without gut impact."</p>

Most felt that while the novel portrayed Hanna's illiteracy as a metaphor for generational illiteracy about the Holocaust, the film failed to convey those thematic overtones.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rosenbaum" title="Ron Rosenbaum">Ron Rosenbaum</a> was critical of the film's fixation on Hanna's illiteracy.</p>

He praised Winslet and Kross for providing "gutsy, intense performances", and noted that Olin and Ganz turn in "memorable appearances." He wrote that the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematography" title="Cinematography">cinematographers</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Menges" title="Chris Menges">Chris Menges</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Deakins" title="Roger Deakins">Roger Deakins</a> lent the film a "fine professional polish". Colm Andrew of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_Independent" title="Manx Independent">Manx Independent</a> also rated it highly and said the film had "countless opportunities to become overly sentimental or dramatic and resists every one of them, resulting in a film which by its conclusion, has you not knowing which quality to praise the most".</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When asked to respond, Hare called it "the most ridiculous thing ... We went to great lengths to make sure that that's exactly what it didn't turn into. The book is much more erotic." Daldry added, "He's a young man who falls in love with an older woman who is complicated, difficult and controlling. That's the story."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film appeared on several critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Reed" title="Rex Reed">Rex Reed</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Observer" title="The New York Observer">The New York Observer</a></i> named it the 2nd best film of 2008.
