      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reitman was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal,_Quebec" title="Montreal, Quebec">Montreal, Quebec</a>. His mother, GeneviÃ¨ve Robert, is a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French-Canadian" title="French-Canadian">French-Canadian</a> actress sometimes billed as GeneviÃ¨ve Deloir. His father is Canadian-Jewish comedy director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Reitman" title="Ivan Reitman">Ivan Reitman</a>, who was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_survivors" title="Holocaust survivors">Holocaust survivors</a>. Reitman has two younger sisters, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Reitman" title="Catherine Reitman">Catherine</a> and Caroline. When he was still a child, his family moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. His father, Ivan, directed the successful films <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters" title="Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripes_(film)" title="Stripes (film)">Stripes</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten_Cop" title="Kindergarten Cop">Kindergarten Cop</a></i>. Jason described his childhood self as "a loser... a movie geek... [and] shy." In the late 1980s, Reitman began appearing in small acting parts and serving as a production assistant on his father's films. He spent time in the editing rooms of his father's movies, learning the process. Throughout his 20s, instead of accepting offers to make commercial feature films, Reitman began making his own short films and directing commercials. Although he was offered the opportunity to direct <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dude,_Where%27s_My_Car%3F" title="Dude, Where's My Car?">Dude, Where's My Car?</a></i> on two separate occasions, he declined.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reitman graduated from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard-Westlake_School" title="Harvard-Westlake School">Harvard-Westlake School</a> in 1995; Reitman was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Jump" title="High Jump">high jumper</a> in High School.

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Film_career">Film career</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2005, Reitman's first feature film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thank_You_for_Smoking" title="Thank You for Smoking">Thank You for Smoking</a></i> opened. Reitman developed the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Buckley" title="Christopher Buckley">Christopher Buckley</a> novel into a screenplay and, eventually, a film. The movie was a commercial and critical success. It grossed over $39 million worldwide by the end of its run, and was nominated for two <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globes" title="Golden Globes">Golden Globes</a>. After the success of <i>Thank You for Smoking</i>, Reitman mentioned in an interview that his next film would be adapting another book (a "white collar satire") into a film. He also mentioned that he had plans to work with Buckley again on an original project. Although the first of these projects would eventually become <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_in_the_Air_(film)" title="Up in the Air (film)">Up in the Air</a></i> , this second project has not come to fruition.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His second film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(film)" title="Juno (film)">Juno</a></i>, generated great buzz after it premiered at the 2007 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Film_Festival" title="Toronto Film Festival">Toronto Film Festival</a> and was released in December 2007. It received tremendous critical acclaim (it was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>'s favourite film of 2007) and received Oscar nominations for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Picture" title="Best Picture">Best Picture</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Page" title="Ellen Page">Ellen Page</a>'s performance as the title character, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_Cody" title="Diablo Cody">Diablo Cody</a>'s original screenplay, and Reitman himself for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Academy Award for Best Director">Best Director</a>. Reitman did win other awards for his work on <i>Juno</i>, including Best Director at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Comedy_Awards#2008" title="Canadian Comedy Awards">2008 Canadian Comedy Awards</a>; he was also honoured with the "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_for_Peace" title="Cinema for Peace">Cinema for Peace</a> Award 2008 for Most Valuable Work of Director, Producers &amp; Screenwriter". The film thus far has grossed over $140 million at the U.S. box office, making it the largest success of Reitman's career and more successful than any of his father's films since <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten_Cop" title="Kindergarten Cop">Kindergarten Cop</a></i>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Silberling" title="Brad Silberling">Brad Silberling</a> was originally attached to direct the movie, but he dropped out over casting differences. Reitman was in the middle of writing a screenplay when he came on board to direct <i>Juno</i> and, at one point, he expressed intent to finish writing and to direct this screenplay.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In March 2006, Reitman formed the production company "Hard C Productions" with producing partner Daniel Dubiecki. The company had an overall deal with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Searchlight_Pictures" title="Fox Searchlight Pictures">Fox Searchlight Pictures</a>, the company that distributed Reitman's first two films. Reitman described his production company's goal as being to produce "small subversive comedy that is independent but accessible". Reitman states that he and Dubiecki "want to make unusual films, and anything that turns a genre on its ear". Through Hard C Productions, Reitman is set to produce and direct <i>Banzai Shadowhands</i>, a comedy about "a once-great ninja who is now living a life of mediocrity". <i>Shadowhands</i> will be written by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(U.S._TV_series)" title="The Office (U.S. TV series)">The Office</a>'</i>s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainn_Wilson" title="Rainn Wilson">Rainn Wilson</a>. Reitman met Wilson on the set of his father's film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Super_Ex-Girlfriend" title="My Super Ex-Girlfriend">My Super Ex-Girlfriend</a></i>, in which Wilson had a supporting role. No start date for filming has been set, and it is unclear as to whether or not Wilson is finished with the script.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hard C Productions produced films <i>The Ornate Anatomy of Living Things</i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer%27s_Body" title="Jennifer's Body">Jennifer's Body</a></i>. <i>Anatomy</i> has been written by Matthew Spicer and Max Winkler, and will revolve around "a Gotham bookstore clerk who discovers a museum devoted to his life". <i>Jennifer's Body</i>, a horror comedy, was written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_Cody" title="Diablo Cody">Diablo Cody</a> and starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Fox" title="Megan Fox">Megan Fox</a>. It revolved around a cheerleader who is possessed by a demon and starts feeding off the boys in a Minnesota farming town. In 2009, Reitman left Hard C to form Right of Way Films.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2001, the year the novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_in_the_Air_(novel)" title="Up in the Air (novel)">Up in the Air</a></i> was published, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Turner" title="Sheldon Turner">Sheldon Turner</a> discovered the book and wrote a screenplay adaptation, which he sold to DreamWorks in 2003. Jason Reitman later came upon the novel (initially attracted by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Buckley" title="Christopher Buckley">Christopher Buckley</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurb" title="Blurb">blurb</a> on the cover) while browsing in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> bookstore <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_Soup" title="Book Soup">Book Soup</a>. Reitman persuaded his father <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Reitman" title="Ivan Reitman">Ivan Reitman</a> to purchase the book's film rights, and the elder Reitman commissioned a screenplay from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Griffin" title="Ted Griffin">Ted and Nicholas Griffin</a>, who used some elements from Turner's script in their own work. Jason Reitman then developed his own screenplay, incorporating some of the elements from the Griffins' script that had (unbeknownst to Reitman) originated with Turner. Some of Turner's inventions that were utilized in the final film include Ryan's boilerplate termination speech ("Anyone who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you're sitting right now..."), a key plot point involving a suicide, and the character of Ryan's partner (written by Turner as male).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reitman initially attempted to claim sole credit for writing the film, and later admitted to being confused when the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America" title="Writers Guild of America">Writers Guild of America</a> ruled that he should share credit with Turner. He and Turner later appeared at a WGA event where both said they were happy to share credit now that the course of events, and Turner's contribution to the final product, had been made clear.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the spring of 2009, Reitman directed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_in_the_Air_(film)" title="Up in the Air (film)">Up in the Air</a></i> starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney" title="George Clooney">George Clooney</a>. <i>Up in the Air</i> is based on a novel written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Kirn" title="Walter Kirn">Walter Kirn</a> about a corporate downsizer who travels from city to city and is fanatical about collecting his ten millionth frequent flier mile. The film features real-world characters cast from the ranks of the recently downsized. "Hidden within a film that seems to be about corporate termination and the economy is a movie about the decision whether to be alone or not," noted Reitman," in an interview conducted just prior to the film's nationwide release. Sheldon Turner and Reitman's <i>Up in the Air</i> screenplay won the Golden Globe Award for best screenplay in 2010.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reitman also executively produced the erotic thriller <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloe_(film)" title="Chloe (film)">Chloe</a></i>, theatrically released by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Classics" title="Sony Pictures Classics">Sony Pictures Classics</a> on March 26, 2010. Reitman helped persuade <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Seyfried" title="Amanda Seyfried">Amanda Seyfried</a> to star in the film. In the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, this film grossed $3 million theatrically and became one of the higher-grossing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_films" title="Specialty films">specialty films</a> in 2010 (according to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a>, "$3 million is the new $10 million" for specialty films' box office in 2010).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before his feature film career began, Jason Reitman wrote and directed six short films. He financed his first short film, "Operation", with money he made by selling ads in desk calendars. The film premiered at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Film_Festival" title="Sundance Film Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a> in 1998.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He was a guest on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Howard_Stern_Show" title="The Howard Stern Show">The Howard Stern Show</a></i> on April 10, 2008; when he was asked if he would direct <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters_III" title="Ghostbusters III">Ghostbusters III</a></i> and cast Howard, he said "Do you know how many times I get asked if I want to do <i>Ghostbusters III</i>? Looking at my career so far, I mean, if you just looked at my two films, I would make the most boring <i>Ghostbusters</i> movie. It would just be people talking about ghosts, there wouldn't be any ghost-busting in it." Stern, a friend of Ivan Reitman, also revealed that he had seen Jason's early short films and was impressed enough to offer him the opportunity to direct an episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_the_Beach" title="Son of the Beach">Son of the Beach</a></i> (a TV series he produced, a goofy parody of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baywatch" title="Baywatch">Baywatch</a></i>), which Jason declined, citing that he was busy obtaining financing for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thank_You_for_Smoking" title="Thank You for Smoking">Thank You for Smoking</a></i> at the time.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reitman produced and directed the 2007 holiday season commercials for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wal-Mart" title="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> with advertising agency <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein-Rein" title="Bernstein-Rein">Bernstein-Rein</a>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ryan Bingham (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney" title="George Clooney">George Clooney</a>) makes his living traveling to workplaces around the United States and conducting wholesale layoffs for employers unwilling to do it in-house. Ryan also delivers motivational speeches, using the analogy "What's In Your Backpack?" to extol the virtues of a life free of burdensome relationships with people as well as things. Ryan relishes the comfort of anonymity during his perpetual travels. His personal life goal is to reach ten million <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequent-flyer_program" title="Frequent-flyer program">frequent flyer</a> miles with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines" title="American Airlines">American Airlines</a>, without redeeming any. While traveling, he meets another frequent flyer named Alex (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Farmiga" title="Vera Farmiga">Vera Farmiga</a>) and they begin a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casual_relationship" title="Casual relationship">casual relationship</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ryan is unexpectedly called back to his company's offices in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska" title="Omaha, Nebraska">Omaha</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska" title="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, where he discovers that an ambitious, freshly-graduated new hire, Natalie Keener (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Kendrick" title="Anna Kendrick">Anna Kendrick</a>) is promoting a plan to cut costs by conducting their layoffs via desktop <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_conference" title="Video conference">videoconferencing</a>. Ryan, who knows this would pose a threat to his plans, and can immediately see the problems with it, argues that Natalie knows nothing about the actual process, live or not, as she has never conducted firings before, and seems overly reliant on her minor in Psychology to judge how people will react. After a brief test, he does not take long to put her on the spot and prove his point. His boss (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Bateman" title="Jason Bateman">Jason Bateman</a>) assigns him to take Natalie with him on his next round of terminations to show her the ropes, much to his annoyance. As they travel together and become better acquainted, Natalie questions Ryan's philosophy, but Ryan is happy to remain in his niche and continue avoiding serious relationships. During the trip, Natalie finds that her boyfriend has unceremoniously dumped her by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_message" title="Text message">text message</a> â€” she is shattered, and Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. Natalie later lectures Ryan about his refusal to consider a commitment to Alex in spite of their obvious compatibility as a couple, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterwards they are both called back to Omaha to begin using Natalie's remote-layoff program instead of firing people face-to-face. Natalie soon discovers the problems after a test run; the laid off person breaks down in tears before the camera, and she is unable to comfort him.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Instead of returning immediately to Omaha, Ryan convinces Alex to accompany him to his younger sister's wedding. His sister's fiancÃ© gets <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_feet" title="Cold feet">cold feet</a>, and Ryanâ€™s older sister talks him into using his motivational skills to persuade him to go through with it: "Go get her." Although this runs counter to all of Ryan's personal ideals, he successfully argues that the important moments in life rarely are <i>not</i> shared. The wedding goes off without any further hitches.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Back in Omaha, Ryan is less than thrilled to learn more about the online firing program and its systematic precision, such as using a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart" title="Flowchart">flowchart</a> for the conversation. Heâ€™s off to deliver his "What's In Your Backpack?" speech at a prestigious convention in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas,_Nevada" title="Las Vegas, Nevada">Las Vegas</a>, but is unable to continue. Ryan walks out shortly after taking the stage. He hurriedly flies to Alex's home in Chicago. When she opens the door, it's apparent that she's a married woman with young children; stunned, Ryan leaves without saying a word. She later tells him on the phone that her family is her real life and he is simply an escape. On his flight home, over Dubuque, Iowa, the crew announces that Ryan has just crossed the ten million mile mark. The airline's chief pilot (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Elliott" title="Sam Elliott">Sam Elliott</a>) comes out of the cockpit to meet Ryan, immediately observing that Ryan is the youngest customer so far to reach the milestone.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Back in his office, Ryan calls the airline to transfer five hundred thousand miles each to his sister and brother-in-law so that they'll be able to fly around the world for their <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeymoon" title="Honeymoon">honeymoon</a>, but this generous action is temporarily delayed by his boss, who comes in and tells Ryan that one of the employees he and Natalie fired has killed herself. Natalie has already quit in shock, via text message; the company has put the remote-layoff program on indefinite hold. Natalie applies for a job in San Francisco, at a company that she applied to before taking the position with the downsizers. When her potential boss asks why she went to Omaha, she confesses it was to follow a boy. The interviewer is impressed by her qualifications and a glowing recommendation from Bingham: â€œHire her and donâ€™t look back.â€&#157; The film concludes with Ryan standing in front of a vast destination board, looking up, and letting go of his luggage. The scene quickly transitions to him giving a speech (see inset) via voice-over to a backdrop of clouds.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian-American" title="Canadian-American">Canadian-American</a> filmmaker <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Reitman" title="Jason Reitman">Jason Reitman</a> later came upon the novel (initially attracted by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Buckley" title="Christopher Buckley">Christopher Buckley</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurb" title="Blurb">blurb</a> on the cover) while browsing in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> bookstore <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_Soup" title="Book Soup">Book Soup</a>. Reitman persuaded his father, Canadian-American filmmaker <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Reitman" title="Ivan Reitman">Ivan Reitman</a>, to purchase the book's film rights, and the elder Reitman commissioned a screenplay from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Griffin" title="Ted Griffin">Ted Griffin</a> and Nicholas Griffin, who used some elements from Turner's script in their own work. Jason Reitman then developed his own screenplay, incorporating some of the elements from the Griffins' script that had (unbeknownst to Reitman) originated with Turner. Some of Turner's inventions that were used in the final film include Ryan's boilerplate termination speech ("Anyone who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you're sitting right now..."), a key plot point involving a suicide, and the character of Ryan's partner (written by Turner as male). Reitman initially attempted to claim sole credit for writing the film, and later admitted to being confused when the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America" title="Writers Guild of America">Writers Guild of America</a> ruled that he should share credit with Turner, whose script Reitman claimed to have never read.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though Reitman has claimed in countless interviews that he wrote the parts specifically for George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, Amy Morton, Sam Elliott and Zach Galifianakis, some of his actors have publicly stated their confusion in Reitman's assertion, if only because they knew he was meeting other actors all along including for his choice to fill his last lead role with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Page" title="Ellen Page">Ellen Page</a> (who starred in Reitman's previous film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(film)" title="Juno (film)">Juno</a></i>) for the part that Kendrick ultimately played. On the part played by Farmiga, he cited her ability to walk a fine line between aggressiveness and femininity. On Kendrick, Reitman cited that he was inspired by her performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Science_(film)" title="Rocket Science (film)">Rocket Science</a></i>. On Clooney, he said, "If you're going to make a movie about a guy who fires people for a living and you still want to like him, that actor better be damn charming and I don't think thereâ€™s a more charming actor alive than George Clooney. I was very lucky he said yes." Reitman said, on the <i>B.S.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Approximately 4,600 people applied to be an extra in the film during the open call on January 24, 2009 and January 25, 2009 at Crestwood Court in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>. <i>Up in the Air</i> cast 2,000 extras with 15 to 25 Missouri actors in minor speaking roles. About 250 extras were used from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska" title="Omaha, Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, area. They were used for filming inside and outside the terminal at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eppley_Airfield" title="Eppley Airfield">Eppley Airfield</a>, while Clooney shot most of his scenes inside the terminal.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While shooting the film in St. Louis and Detroit, Reitman placed an ad in the paper asking if people who recently lost their job wanted to be in a documentary about job loss. He specified "documentary" in the ad so actors would not respond to the ad. Reitman was amazed by how many people of different age, race, and gender were willing to speak frankly about what happened and what a cathartic experience it was for these people. They received a startling amount of responses with 100 responses; 60 people on camera (30 in Detroit and 30 in St. Louis). Twenty-two made it into the film. They interviewed them for about ten minutes on what it is like to lose their job in this kind of economy, and after that they would "fire" them on camera and ask them to either respond the way they did the day they lost their job or, if they preferred, the way they wished they had responded.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filming was mostly done in the St. Louis area. Several scenes were also filmed at the Berry and McNamara Terminals at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Metro_Airport" title="Detroit Metro Airport">Detroit Metro Airport</a> in late February 2009 with minimal filming in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska" title="Omaha, Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas,_Nevada" title="Las Vegas, Nevada">Las Vegas, Nevada</a> and in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami,_Florida" title="Miami, Florida">Miami, Florida</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Missouri and St. Louis leaders provided about $4 million in tax credits for the $25 million film. Producers set up a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a> production office January 5, 2009. Filming began in St. Louis on March 3, 2009 and continued through the end of April.

The film was shot at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport for five days, twenty hours each day.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In October 2008 Production Services of Omaha scouted locations in Omaha, Nebraska for three days of filming in late April with Clooney. Some of the scenes were shot inside the Visitor's Bureau and in a condo in the Old Market area of downtown Omaha and at the south end of the main terminal at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eppley_Airfield" title="Eppley Airfield">Eppley Airfield</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reitman needed fifty days to film <i>Up in the Air</i>, eight of which were devoted to aerial shooting. The aerial shots turned out to be more difficult than he had expected. He was unable to use three days of the aerial filming. Many of the aerial shots, such as the crop circle on fire, are featured in the trailer but are not used in the film. The pilot who flies the Boeing 747 that carries the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_shuttle" title="Space shuttle">space shuttle</a> flew the aircraft used for the aerial shots.</p>

Competing brands are displayed only as blurs in scene backgrounds or are replaced with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym" title="Pseudonym">pseudonyms</a> in dialogue. However, the brands did not pay for the exposure; rather, they exchanged shooting locations, such as AA's airport areas and Hilton hotels. Reitman expressed his desire to use real brands as he finds them less distracting.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The post-production schedule for <i>Up in the Air</i> was shorter than <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Reitman" title="Jason Reitman">Jason Reitman</a>'s previous two films. The editing team only had a 16 or 17 week post schedule, whereas the normal post schedule is anywhere from 22 to 26 weeks. Reitman was involved in post-production during shooting. The film was shot entirely on location and Glauberman stayed in L.A. to cut. She would send him scenes every day or every other day as she finished them, and he would look at them. He flew home every weekend to work with her for a few hours on Saturdays or Sundays. That was the only way they were able to stay on schedule.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Editing helped determine how nonverbal moments shape the first meeting between Ryan and Alex, who become lovers. "In a scene like that, there is a sort of playfulness that goes on," editor, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_E._Glauberman" title="Dana E. Glauberman">Dana E. Glauberman</a> said. "There were little looks that they gave each other. Sometimes I stayed a beat longer on a take to get that little sparkle in their eyes. ... You can see a lot of playfulness in the quick cuts back and forth when they are teasing each other, but then there are also certain moments that Vera would give a little raise of an eyebrow, or George would give the same thing. Those tiny nuances are really helpful to show their character and show what they are after."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jason Reitman has heavily promoted <i>Up in the Air</i> with personal appearances during film festivals and other showings.

Not just in its casual and apparently effortless excellence, but in its ability to blend entertainment and insight, comedy and poignancy, even drama and reality, things that are difficult by themselves but a whole lot harder in combination.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Claudia Puig of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i> praised the film's sense of timeliness, writing, "It's tough to capture an era while it's still happening, yet <i>Up in the Air</i> does so brilliantly, with wit and humanity...Reitman emerges as a modern-day <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra" title="Frank Capra">Frank Capra</a>, capturing the nation's anxieties and culture of resilience." Stephen Saito of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Film_Channel" title="Independent Film Channel">IFC.com</a></i> wrote, "[I]t touches on larger themes of mass unemployment, cultural alienation and technology as a crutch. But ultimately, it's really an expertly done character study that's a dramatic change of pace from director Jason Reitman's previous two films." Jonathan Romney of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i> wrote "[I]ts cynical wit almost places it in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Wilder" title="Billy Wilder">Billy Wilder</a> bracket: <i>Up In The Air</i> is as eloquent about today's executive culture as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apartment" title="The Apartment">The Apartment</a> was about that of 1960. It is a brutal, desolate film â€“ but also a superb existential rom-com, and the most entertaining lesson in contemporary socio-economics that you could hope for." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> gave the film four stars and wrote, "This isn't a comedy. If it were, it would be hard to laugh in these last days of 2009. Nor is it a tragedy. It's an observant look at how a man does a job."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Calling the film "a slickly engaging piece of lightweight <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism" title="Existentialism">existentialism</a>," Todd McCarthy wrote in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> that "Clooney owns his role in the way first-rate film stars can, so infusing the character with his own persona that everything he does seems natural and right.

[It] feels tailor-made for George Clooney, who is very good. But the stakes remain frustratingly low and it's one of those contemporary middlebrow projects that asks us to root for a genial, shallow individual as he learns to be a little less the man he was." Julian Sancton of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)" title="Vanity Fair (magazine)">Vanity Fair</a></i> wrote, "There are two movies in <i>Up in the Air</i>: one about a guy who's flying around the country firing people, and one about a commitment-phobe who's flying away from responsibility and a shot at true love, as embodied by Farmiga. There is no attempt to braid these two threads together, and that's where the movie feels unsatisfying." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Hoberman" title="J. Hoberman">J. Hoberman</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_Voice" title="The Village Voice">The Village Voice</a></i> wrote, "Like <i>Juno</i>, <i>Up in the Air</i> conjures a troubling reality and then wishes it away. The filmmakers have peeked into the abyss and averted their eyes...[the film] warns that you can't go home againâ€”and then, full of false cheer and false consciousness, pretends you can."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Shave Magazine'</i>s Jake Tomlinson wrote that "There is a very strong sense of humor as well as emotional depth, yet the scope of the film sometimes limits these sentiments. As a moviegoer, this film provides a satisfying experience where one can take a step back to ponder some of the finer points in our daily lives, but don't expect to find all the answers here. 4 out of 5 stars."</p>
