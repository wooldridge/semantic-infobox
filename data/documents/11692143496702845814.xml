She appeared in the film noir <i>Side Street</i> (1950) playing a gangster's sincere, but none-too-bright gun moll. She is arguably best remembered for her comic performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singin%27_in_the_Rain_(film)" title="Singin' in the Rain (film)">Singin' in the Rain</a></i>. As the vain and talentless <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_movie" title="Silent movie">silent movie</a> star Lina Lamont, Hagen received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By 1953, she had joined the cast of the television sitcom <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Danny_Thomas_Show" title="The Danny Thomas Show">Make Room for Daddy</a></i>. As the first wife of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Thomas" title="Danny Thomas">Danny Thomas</a>, Hagen received three <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Award</a> nominations, but after three seasons she grew dissatisfied and left the series. Thomas, who also produced the show, reportedly didn't appreciate Jean's departing the successful series, and her character was killed off rather than recast. This was the first TV character to be killed off a family sitcom. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Lord" title="Marjorie Lord">Marjorie Lord</a> was cast a year later as Danny's second wife and played against Thomas successfully for several seasons. Hagen starred in the 1957 Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Season 3, Episode 7, entitled "Enough Rope for Two".

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1976, she made a comeback of sorts playing character roles in episodes of the television series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starsky_and_Hutch" title="Starsky and Hutch">Starsky and Hutch</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Streets_of_San_Francisco" title="The Streets of San Francisco">The Streets of San Francisco</a></i>, and made her final film appearance in the 1977 television movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander:_The_Other_Side_of_Dawn" title="Alexander: The Other Side of Dawn">Alexander: The Other Side of Dawn</a></i>.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Don Lockwood (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Kelly" title="Gene Kelly">Gene Kelly</a>) is a popular silent film star with humble roots as a singer, dancer and stunt man. Don barely tolerates his vapid, shallow leading lady, Lina Lamont (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Hagen" title="Jean Hagen">Jean Hagen</a>), though their studio, Monumental Pictures, links them romantically to increase their popularity. Lina herself is convinced they are in love, despite Don's protestations otherwise.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One day, to escape from overenthusiastic fans, Don jumps into a passing car driven by Kathy Selden (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Reynolds" title="Debbie Reynolds">Debbie Reynolds</a>). She drops him off, but not before claiming to be a stage actress and sneering at his undignified accomplishments. At first, she pretends not to know who he is, but later in the film, she admits that she knew who he was all along and is also a big fan. Later, at a party, the head of Don's studio, R.F. Simpson (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millard_Mitchell" title="Millard Mitchell">Millard Mitchell</a>), shows a short demonstration of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film" title="Sound film">talking picture</a>, but his guests are unimpressed. To Don's amusement and Kathy's embarrassment, she pops out of a mock cake right in front of him as part of the entertainment; Kathy, it turns out, is only a chorus girl. Furious at Don's teasing, she throws a real cake at him, only to hit Lina right in the face. Later, after weeks of searching, Don makes up with Kathy after he finds her working in another Monumental Pictures production, and they begin to fall in love.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After a rival studio has an enormous hit with its first talking picture, 1927's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jazz_Singer_(1927_film)" title="The Jazz Singer (1927 film)">The Jazz Singer</a></i>, R.F. decides he has no choice but to convert the new Lockwood and Lamont film, <i>The Dueling Cavalier,</i> into a talkie. The production is beset with difficulties that reportedly reflect what actually took place during the early days of talking pictures. By far the worst problem is Lina's grating voice. An exasperated diction coach tried to teach her how to speak properly ("tah, tay, tea, toe, two"), but to no avail ("No, no, no, Miss Lamont. Rrrrround tones, rrrrround tones."). A test screening is a disaster. In one scene, Don repeats the line "I love you" to Lina over and over, to the audience's derisive laughter (a reference to a scene by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilbert_(actor)" title="John Gilbert (actor)">John Gilbert</a> in his first talkie). Then throughout the movie, the sound went out of synchronization ("Yes, yes, yes. No, no, no.").</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Don's best friend, Cosmo Brown (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_O%27Connor" title="Donald O'Connor">Donald O'Connor</a>), comes up with the idea to dub Lina's voice with Kathy's, and they persuade R.F. to turn <i>The Dueling Cavalier</i> into a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_Film" title="Musical Film">musical</a> called <i>The Dancing Cavalier</i>, complete with a modern musical number called "Broadway Melody". When Lina finds out, she is furious and does everything possible to sabotage the romance between Don and Kathy. She becomes even angrier when she discovers that R.F. intends to give Kathy a screen credit and a big publicity promotion. Lina, after consulting lawyers, threatens to sue R.F. unless he cancels Kathy's buildup and orders her to continue working (uncredited) as Lina's voice. R.F. reluctantly agrees to her demands.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The premiere of <i>The Dancing Cavalier</i> is a tremendous success. When the audience clamors for Lina to sing live, Don, Cosmo, and R.F. improvise and get her to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_sync" title="Lip sync">lip sync</a> while Kathy sings into a second microphone while hidden behind the stage curtain. Later, while Lina is "singing," Don, Cosmo and R.F. gleefully open the curtain. When Cosmo replaces Kathy at the microphone, the deception becomes obvious. Lina flees in embarrassment. Kathy tries to run away as well, but Don introduces the audience to "the real star of the film." The final shot shows Kathy and Don in front of a billboard for their new movie, <i>Singin' in the Rain</i>.</p>

	  <li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Kelly" title="Gene Kelly">Gene Kelly</a> as Don Lockwood, the main protagonist of the film. Although his performance in the song <i>Singin' in the Rain</i> is now considered iconic, Kelly was not the first choice for the roleâ€”<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Keel" title="Howard Keel">Howard Keel</a> was originally cast. However, Keel was replaced by Kelly as the screenwriters evolved the character from a "Western actor" to a "song-and-dance vaudeville" performer.</li>
	  <li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Reynolds" title="Debbie Reynolds">Debbie Reynolds</a> as Kathy Selden.

Yet, Director Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly insisted that Debbie Reynolds always was first in their mind for the role. Although the film revolves around the idea that Kathy has to dub over for Lina's voice, even in the talking scenes, it was actually Jean Hagen's normal voice. Reynolds herself was dubbed in "Would You?" and "You are My Lucky Star" by an uncredited <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Noyes" title="Betty Noyes">Betty Noyes</a>. Also, when Kathy is supposedly dubbing Lina's voice in the live performance of "Singing in the Rain" at the end of the film, Jean Hagen is actually dubbing Reynolds' speaking voice.</li>

The initials of the fictional head of Monumental Pictures are a reference to producer Freed.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an early draft of the script, the musical number "Singin' in the Rain" was to be sung by Debbie Reynolds, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_O%27Connor" title="Donald O'Connor">Donald O'Connor</a>, and Gene Kelly on their way back from the flop preview of <i>The Dueling Cavalier.</i> In addition, "You Were Meant For Me" was not included in that draft. Instead, the love song was supposed to be Gene Kelly's version of "All I Do is Dream of You," which would be sung after the party at R.F. Simpson's house, when Kelly chases after Reynolds. The song would have ended up at Kelly's house. The footage of this scene has been lost. Reynolds' solo rendition of "You Are My Lucky Star" (to a billboard showing an image of Lockwood) was cut from the film, but has survived and is included on the original soundtrack and DVD version of the film. Rita Moreno was originally to have sung "I Got a Feelin' You're Foolin'," but this ended up being part of the Beautiful Girl medley.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the famous dance routine in which Gene Kelly sings the title song while twirling an umbrella, splashing through puddles and getting soaked to the skin, he was actually dancing in water with a little bit of milk added, so that the water puddles and raindrops would show up better on film. Kelly was sick with a 103-degree fever at the time. A common myth is that Kelly managed to perform the entire song in one take, thanks to cameras placed at predetermined locations. However this was not the case as the filming of the sequence took place over 2â€“3 days.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Debbie Reynolds was not a dancer at the time she made <i>Singin' in the Rain</i>Â â€” her background was as a gymnast. Kelly apparently insulted her for her lack of dance experience, upsetting her. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Astaire" title="Fred Astaire">Fred Astaire</a> was hanging around the studio and found Reynolds crying under a piano. Hearing what had happened, Astaire volunteered to help her with her dancing. Kelly later admitted that he had not been kind to Reynolds and was surprised that she was still willing to talk to him afterwards. After shooting the "Good Morning" routine, Reynolds' feet were bleeding. Years later, she was quoted as saying that making this film and surviving childbirth were the two most difficult experiences of her life.</p>
